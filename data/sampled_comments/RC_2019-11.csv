[So did Americans at one time or at least reasonably inexpensive and then the fire nation attacked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK0KOimnZu0) The issue isn't what happenstance and situation has merely flung upon a country, but that in the fact that capitalism is not a system of intrinsic prosperity. It's as much a system of speed and oppression. And for some countries, speed is what is necessary to survive.   
Capitalism is in essence akin to an arms-race itself. The goal of an arms race isn't to produce anything of value so much as defend itself from external forces. Amongst international capitalism, every state is as at once both cooperative and competitive, finding advantage and exploitation where it can and producing benefit where it must to acquire that situation of exploitation.   
In this case, the Nordic system is in the cycle where it's producing a benefit to it's own people and it's seemingly on the cusp of turning that benefit into exploitation again. It's a cycle that's seen in every capitalist country and capitalists play shell games with wealth and labor amongst the intra-communities and then globally in the inter-communities.",1572566400

"Scotland","t5_2qkli","I didn't reply to this earlier because it would have prolonged this thread beyond where I wanted to leave it, but one thing I do want to post a retort for:

&gt;I can show you why I'm fairly convinced he had a hand in making really dirty against a vulnerable opponent

Due to the nature of twitter, almost every candidate could be subjected to that, however, Charles Kennedy being vulnerable is not an excuse. You cannot and I hope are not saying that they shouldn't have politically engaged in unseating him purely because of his personal troubles.

Whilst I agree that personal attacks don't serve debate much (its why I am vehemently in favour of Rule 4), sometimes it's simply unavoidable in an objective sense, even if the initial reaction is subjective.

Imagine for example that you and I are at a hustings on opposite sides of the aisle (not a long shot I'm sure you'll agree).

I stand up and say (without aiming it him personally, only the panel), ""I don't feel that someone dealing with a serious, personal, physical and mental condition, can objectively and effectively, fulfil their role as a public servant. It is in fact a disservice to themselves and to the public, because as long as they must focus their full attention on getting better, that is mutually exclusive with serving the public to their best extent.""

That is as nice as I can phrase it. There was a news article recently about an MP who got stick on Twitter for his spelling and grammar in tweets and he revealed that he's dyslexic. No shade here, glad I know so I can modify my attitude when reading their feed.

Can you honestly tell me that you wouldn't hold a personal issue against an MP who you're politically against, if you felt that it impacted them in their capacity as an MP? For example, if an MP had anorexia and was frequently impacted by therapy or hospital appointments.  I would not judge you for commenting on that personal situation when it came to replacing them, because it would ultimately be better for the people they represent. Because they'd represent the people who support them AND those that don't. 

But for people who are always in the public eye and always ultimately accountable to the people who elect them, ignoring their personal life when it impacts their professional is intellectually dishonest.

Look at Tim Farron for example, and the stooshie around him.

Be super nice to the cooks and bartenders. And too them out accordingly. They control when your stuff gets made. And chefs will be nicer to you, when you out an order in wrong (it's gonna happen), and fix it faster. 

Managers are there to help you. If anyone complains about something you can't control apologize, and if they seem upset ask if they want to talk to a manager. ( I ask almost Everytime because I am too busy to stand there while they slowly make a complaint taking forever to get to the point) 

Be transparent. I work on campus at a buffalo wild wings. So on game days our ticket times can run 2 hours. I tell them this before they order so they know if they want to wait that long and don't get mad later. If your busy let them know the kitchen is backed up. 
If you are waiting on the bartender to change a keg for a beer, let them know and ask if they want a water while waiting. Sometimes bartenders can get backed up and end up putting it off for 10 minutes or so.

If you get double or triple sat. Take everyone's drink orders at once. When dropping them off, say ""I'll be back in just a minute to take your order"" drop off all drinks. Then take all tables orders and put them in the computer at the same time. This prevents people from sitting to long without being greeted or getting their drinks. And it's much faster to take all orders and then put them in, than running back and forth. Also sometimes you have to wait for another person to finish putting in orders for their tables.

Overall try to be quick. But if it takes a few minutes people will generally understand.

Also tell people you are new. They will generally go easier on you and not be so quick to complain.",1572566401

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One of my former best friends started dating a 14 year old when he was 19, and cut ties with me and another friend when we called him out on it. He is a reckless driver (on his fourth car already after 3 years of driving) who doesn't listen when you tell him to slow down, and he's obviously dating someone underage. I don't know how ""involved"" they are, and I don't know why her parents are okay with it since he apparently lives with them (his father, mother and step mother all kicked him out). As far as I'm aware, he's waiting until she's legal before he gets ""serious"" with her, but as long as she's consenting to the relationship and he knows the danger he's putting himself in, I'm not getting involved. 

I won't report him to the police because he's a former friend and I believe the whole reason he's doing this is due to the rough childhood he had. However, if he's found out and arrested then I have no quarrels with it. I just hope for his sake that he realises what he's doing is wrong, and that he bails out without consequences (because of course if it's a tough breakup then she could ruin him and send him to prison).",1572566401

"u_LinBM","t5_kt08h","I feel you put too much into the graphics and not enough into content (though the content you do have is quite good). For an entry level position one page is ideal. I feel you could get this content into one page pretty easily.

Your side graphics are kinda cool but the metric is arbitrary and they might give you harder questions since you claimed to know something in and out that it turns out you know know a college level of. The reason i didn't continue after my masters is i realized i was learning way more working than i was in school and getting paid for it vs paying. Most companies don't expect a lot out of you out of college because they know you really only know the basics even if you feel like you know it all. I was interviewing with someone at Lockheed Martin that had put a rover on Mars and had been working for 30 years. If i said i knew C++ at a 4/5 level he would have laughed at me because a 4/5 for him would have put me at 15 years of work experience. But they didn't except me to because i was fresh out of school and are absolutely fine with that. Basically what i'm saying here is instead of saying you know know these things at various levels, you can condense that section to a small comma separated list of things you know without ratings and use the extra space to go over stuff you have done to demonstrate your skills vs rate them yourself. Then again if you don't need the space then it does look decent and makes yours pop vs others. Then again some engineering positions don't like the pop as they feel it is you trying to fill space or distract from not having other content. I have a two line section of mine that has a list of all languages and software i know or have used.

Another thing you should try and mention if there is room is demonstrating leadership and teamwork skills. That can be in projects or in clubs outside of school/work.

Classes are good to have on there especially ones related to the field you are applying for and particularly projects/group projects. I like to keep my resume to one page but my draft version is 1.5. When i'm applying i tailor it to the particular position. So i reword some sections to make it sound more appealing to the company/position. You can get keywords to add in off their recruiting page or application page if it's for that particular position. I also remove the less relevant stuff to make it one page.

Speaking of customization, you don't seem to have a mission statement or anything like that. You're going to want one.

I'm also lazy and didn't actually read it all so i don't have any comments on grammar or whatever. But i did like how you used action verbs and different ones for each bullet. Repetition is boring and whoever is reading this is also reading 20 others while also doing their actual job. Thus why keywords and stuff are important. That's also why many people like single page ones.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want any examples i have several versions of mine as well as a lot of friends from the same field. I graduated with Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Feel free to DM me.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Hi, sorry I ended up being late to this rewatch, I only just found out about it a few days ago and it wasn’t until now that I actually had the time to sit down and get caught up for the rewatch. This show is something that’s very special to me, and while this is the sort of thing I’d normally write for Episode 1, since I missed that particular boat you’ll have to put up with me gushing about it now, a solid quarter of the way into the series already. Just warning that this is like a full-essay-length ramble coming up, so sorry if this comes off as pretentious or whatever. 

Hyouka came at just about the perfect time in my life for it. I watched it for the first time in the summer of 2018, and I had just wrapped up my last year of high school, ready to close the book on my high school life as a whole, and I think Hyouka is basically the perfect anime for that sort of contemplative, reflective mood. Lots of anime have this sort of romanticized view of high school life, and that’s still absolutely true of Hyouka, but for some reason this show perfectly captures what it feels like to look back on those days. I think there’s a lot of reasons for that, from the visuals, the soundtrack, to the characters and the writing. It’s all just so...peaceful. This was my first SoL anime that I ever watched, and boy was that a good decision. This show proved to me that you don’t need hype moments or a really intense overarching story for me to find it enthralling. 

As a teenager I had a lot of times where my thought process went a lot like Oreki’s, and funnily enough the series of events that sets him on his path towards self-actualization has a lot of strange parallels to events in my own life, so I already was inclined to like him, but he’s just such a funny, relatable, and likeable guy that he eventually became one of my favorite characters ever, and this just improves as the series goes on. Really, the same could be said for all four of our main cast, half the fun of this series is watching these four lovable dorks bounce off each other, grow and develop for 20+ episodes. I’ll have a lot more to say about them all later on, especially towards the end, but for now it’s mostly other stuff I want to focus on.

I can’t see anything from this show without it instantly putting me in a better mood, and I think it has that effect on a lot of people. It’s relaxing while still having some really engaging storylines, it’s comedic but never gets exhausting or feels over-the-top, it can be dramatic without ever being a downer and certainly never exploitative. Somehow each of the little mysteries are fun despite the very worst acts being investigated are [mild spoiler warning](/s ""petty theft, a bit of emotional manipulation, and pretty standard teen drama"".) The stakes are always very low, but because I love the presentation and the characters so much it’s never boring.

 I’m not very qualified to speak of the technical details because I’m not really that well-versed in the sort of techniques used, but this show is definitely the most consistently pretty TV anime I’ve seen in my (admittedly fairly limited) experience. The lighting and coloration work in particular is absolutely gorgeous, and I think I could frame almost any given still from this show and hang it on a wall somewhere. I’ve noticed a couple of cut corners on this rewatch, but they’re so few and far between it doesn’t matter. The show uses a lot of very bright, gentle colors and natural lighting to make everything feel just that much more real, welcoming and calming, and the classical-heavy soundtrack just adds to the laid-back feel. God, I love this show. It hurts knowing how many of the people responsible for this work of art got stolen from this world in the summer. Anyway, onto the episode at hand.",1572566406

"news","t5_2qh3l","You think the Marshall plan was all that happened? You think we just pumped money into Germany and that made them forget about Nazism? Your ignorance of denazification is simply awe inspiring. We occupied Germany for decades and forced Germans to feel shame for their actions. THAT is why Nazism has never come back in Germany.

Here is what *actually* caused Germans to desert Nazism: 

We held the entire nation responsible for the crimes committed by the Third Reich, in order to instill a sense of Collective Responsibility, Collective Punishment, and Collective Guilt.

We forced Germans to tour concentration camps, exhume mass graves, and bury the bodies of slain Jews.

We barred any German with ties to the Nazi party from being allowed to hold any civil job.

We destroyed all traces of Nazism. We tore down their buildings, their art, and their statues.

We forced them to ban swastikas and hate speech.

We took control of German media by taking over 37 German newspapers, six radio stations, 314 theaters, 642 cinemas, 101 magazines, 237 book publishers, and 7,384 book dealers and printers.

We prohibited criticism of occupying allied forces and banned 30,000 books.

We tried their military and government leaders in public and executed and imprisoned them.

The Psychological Warfare Division of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force undertook a psychological propaganda campaign in order to develop a German sense of collective responsibility and guilt.

We forced German citizens to watch movies such as ""Die Todesmühlen"" and ""Welt im Film No. 5"" to show them the horrors of the concentration camps.

We published posters and pamphlets with pictures of dead bodies in concentration camps and plastered them all over German cities. These posters typically contained the words YOU ARE GUILTY OF THIS and THESE ATROCITIES ARE YOUR FAULT

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Hey thanks for that reply!  I appreciated it.  

It’s great when there is real communication here.  

I wish I could figure out a way to help people wade through the people with zero training or experience.   Truly!  Absolutely there are people just wanting to make money.  I’m on fb groups that make me sick.  Greedy and unqualified.  And even more people who I think mean well, but are clueless.  

But even the “listings” and “referral services” seem to just be out to make a buck by charging or by making you complete “their programs.”   So they don’t really help.

I’m working on my website, but again, being able to make a good website doesn’t say anything about your coaching ability. Even testimonials don’t really matter. It’s impossible to know if they are real.


You didn’t ask .... but I have a bachelors and a Masters degree in special education. 23 years teaching experience, working with students who have mild disabilities. The majority of them with ADHD.  In my job I worked frequently and successfully with parents and teachers to help them understand and help their kiddos.  And often deal with their own struggles (ADHD being common in families, parents often were dealing with their own issues.  Parents often get diagnosed when their kids do.... it’s frequently what makes them see it in themselves.) 

Then a year long supervised life coach training program.   But no programs are truly accredited.  So you basically have to take my word that it was a legitimate/ quality  program.   

A week in California learning even more about Executive Function Skills.  A week in Colorado training to use drums/ rhythms to help with ADHD (and Alzheimer’s patients, and therapeutic groups).  

More short coaching programs than you can count.  A certification in instructional coaching so I can coach teachers to do a better job with ADHD students.  

Seeing a handful of clients in my new office for months.  

My 18’year old was diagnosed at age eight. 

I was diagnosed in my late 40s.  



But still there is no real way to communicate clearly that I am qualified.  And of course none of that actually guarantees anything.  I honestly hope that licensing becomes required. That would definitely help.

Sorry.  That was just me being frustrated, too!   


Thanks for letting me vent.",1572566406

"u_LinBM","t5_kt08h","I feel you put too much into the graphics and not enough into content (though the content you do have is quite good). For an entry level position one page is ideal. I feel you could get this content into one page pretty easily. 

Your side graphics are kinda cool but the metric is arbitrary and they might give you harder questions since you claimed to know something in and out that it turns out you know know a college level of. The reason i didn't continue after my masters is i realized i was learning way more working than i was in school and getting paid for it vs paying. Most companies don't expect a lot out of you out of college because they know you really only know the basics even if you feel like you know it all. I was interviewing with someone at Lockheed Martin that had put a rover on Mars and had been working for 30 years. If i said i knew C++ at a 4/5 level he would have laughed at me because a 4/5 for him would have put me at 15 years of work experience. But they didn't except me to because i was fresh out of school and are absolutely fine with that. Basically what i'm saying here is instead of saying you know know these things at various levels, you can condense that section to a small comma separated list of things you know without ratings and use the extra space to go over stuff you have done to demonstrate your skills vs rate them yourself. Then again if you don't need the space then it does look decent and makes yours pop vs others. Then again some engineering positions don't like the pop as they feel it is you trying to fill space or distract from not having other content. I have a two line section of mine that has a list of all languages and software i know or have used. 

Another thing you should try and mention if there is room is demonstrating leadership and teamwork skills. That can be in projects or in clubs outside of school/work. 

Classes are good to have on there especially ones related to the field you are applying for and particularly projects/group projects. I like to keep my resume to one page but my draft version is 1.5. When i'm applying i tailor it to the particular position. So i reword some sections to make it sound more appealing to the company/position. You can get keywords to add in off their recruiting page or application page if it's for that particular position. I also remove the less relevant stuff to make it one page. 

Speaking of customization, you don't seem to have a mission statement or anything like that. You're going to want one. 

I'm also lazy and didn't actually read it all so i don't have any comments on grammar or whatever. But i did like how you used action verbs and different ones for each bullet. Repetition is boring and whoever is reading this is also reading 20 others while also doing their actual job. Thus why keywords and stuff are important. That's also why many people like single page ones.

If you want any examples i have several versions of mine as well as a lot of friends from the same field. I graduated with Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Feel free to DM me.",1572566407

But how exactly is CPS going to know that there is a pattern of abuse if no one calls the minor shit in? 


A kid could get hit 10 times in the public, only 1 person calls it in because ""I don't know the backstory."" and all CPS knows is that the kid got hit once and they can't do shit even though the kid gets hit so frequently that it happened 10 times in the public eye. 


Most abusers are smart enough to not do shit that people can see, that's why we try to look for signs such as bed-wetting.

*Reasons for trans*:Not a massive fan of body hair, I don’t have a strong desire to lose it but it’d be nice to have a little less. 
I considered cross dressing at one point.
I jerk off to futa/trap porn frequently, although I don’t really self insert in it at all.
I used to wear long sleeved shirts and pants even when it was hot out. iirc I liked the style and the extra protection from insects but that still keeps me up at night for some reason.
I’ve never really wanted to be a “burly manly man”
I used to think a vascectomy was getting your testicles cut off, and was ok with the idea of it happening to me, even though after I found out what a vascectomy actually was I thought it was way better
I feel occasionally feel anxious when referred to as male, but I still want to be referred to as male.
*Reasons for cis*:I’m really happy that I was born a guy and if I could pick my agab I’d pick male without thinking.
I’ve always loved playing as male characters in games, to the point that I am sort of put off if a game only has a female protagonist and I prefer male/ambiguous characters in online games.
I’ve been jealous of other guys, and I still do feel jealousy whenever I see a guy with nice abs or hair.
I really like most of my masculine features, such as being tall, having short hair, and having a deep voice.
My habits during this period of questioning strongly match those of an OCD obsession, and I have intrusive thoughts about this topic frequently.
When my intrusive thoughts stop I feel *extreme* euphoria and sometimes I’m so happy I repeat phrases like “I’m a boy” out loud to myself just to make it better.
I feel repulsed whenever I imagine myself with feminine features and I dislike some I have (or at least think I have) 
She/her pronouns just don’t feel right at all.
I have a crippling fear of developing gender dysphoria or becoming trans. 
And the biggest one: I’d rather kill myself than transition. Even if I did have dysphoria I’d prefer to stay as a man because I just like being one.
Welp that’s everything. Brb gonna go ruminate about how I’m lying to myself somehow",1572566408

And take some small solace in the fact that you're reacting like any sane mind would react to this system that's fundamentally broken at its core. It's horrible, and the suffering is unbearable. But look at these strangers stepping up to help however they can. They don't know you, but many of them are taking the time to respond and help. It's a small thing, but so is a redwood seed.

You've been told how to feel about life, how to feel about authority, and how to feel about your place in the world. And it was all wrong. You don't know your own feelings anymore because your mind has locked those away. The cognitive dissonance your feelings caused wasn't something you could bear until now. You were told that to be a good person, to be safe, to be accepted you must feel a certain way about many things. And those instructions were wrong. And the only feelings that are still accessible to you as part of this corruption are coming to the surface as you begin to wake up. Rage, melancholy, shame, fear.

The world you've been living in is incompatible with your nature as a human being. And anyone you've seen that appears to be doing well in this world is actually suffering terribly. They've just been successful so far at hiding it. This empire of mind is insidious. It's actually trained us to self-oppress. Like crabs pulling each other down as they try to climb out of the bucket, we all sit together trying to convince everyone else we're fine because obviously everyone else is, so it must be 'me' that's a failure. 

But you're beginning to find your way out. You have to take the journey yourself, but you don't have to take it alone. There are helpers, friends, and lovers that you'll meet along the way, and the love you're going to find will astound you. But as you get ready to trudge out the cave, I'd like to offer this advice. Learn to truly love yourself, and once you've started that, you'll be able to begin untangling your real feelings and from there, purpose will come and signpost will start to appear. So treat yourself with all the kindness you can imagine. Set boundaries wherever you feel uncomfortable. And always consider the middle path.

These are Divine Abidings that we are meant to cultivate. Anyway, karuna (compassion) is often misunderstood in the west, likely due to our own Judeo-Christian culture. What we are not meant to do is to feel the sufferings, hurts and pain of the other person. There is no cathartic or clarifying wisdom in that approach. What happens if we do this is that our own energy is attenuated, our pain multiplies and we begin to flail.

What we are supposed to cultivate is a feeling of kindness and goodwill that acknowledges the suffering of others and seeks their release. However, the mind imbued with karuna is not desperate, overwhelmed or angry, it is assured and confident and light. Even in the face of incredible suffering. (And btw, karuna is limitless. It's not only for the 'victims'. As it grows, it realizes the victim-hood of all sentient beings.)

"smallbusiness","t5_2qr34","*I was talking tax payments, at rereading it sounds like you mean not running payroll at all?*

Yes. You have to make timely tax payments, and that means for estimated tax payments you are assessed a late payment penalty if you don't make them each quarter AND don't meet a safe harbor.

So you can just make sure your withholdings meet the safe harbor of last year's tax liability, and then you'll be fine.",1572566409

however bringing up the fact that you’ve been born one way and should stay that was has always been considered rude imo because we know that and have been telling ourselves that for a long time and when we finally have the confidence to tell someone they pull this card.

idk what to advise you to do except you gotta wait it out. i’m sorry. i wish there was something i could recommend, but again i’m in a similar situation so if i find a loophole or piece of advice, i’d be happy to help

in the meantime surround yourself with people who accept you, even if it’s only one person or online people. it helps a lot. i have faith that you’ll be able to transition and stay with your family if that’s what you decide

So the trick or treaters are making the rounds tonight.  Instead of dishing out the sugary goods to the little kiddos, I decided to give out toothbrushes to preserve their precious pearly whites (one day they will thank me for it! and perhaps it will save a bill at the dentist office for the 'rents).   The doorbell rings and I am greeted to a small group of kids, one dressed up as superman and the others as a mummy and professor x.  ""Trick or treat!"", they cry in unison and present their buckets, expecting treats.  I drop a few toothbrushes in there.   The mummy threw a toothbrush at me and told me I suck.  Am I the asshole for giving them toothbrushes trying to do a good deed instead of the usual candy?

The only way kids develop maturity is through making their own mistakes and choices, then dealing with the consequences. It’s normal development for them to want to do things for themselves and move out. You should be encouraging this. Teach him to cook, clean, do his laundry in preparation. Get him to do a small part time job to help him earn money and be in the world.

In the paragraph that begins with

I think that the ending of that paragraph

Or have more similar wording at least (odd instead of strange).

The only overall complaint I would have is that this leaves a **lot** of questions unanswered. Like it's almost *too* intriguing or maybe too vague. I know you cut down nearly half of the story, but it might be worth sacrificing a bit of dialogue or some more verbose areas in order to provide us a *little* more information?

No, it really isn't.  The damage is really rather low.  The only reason it seems quick (when in the secondary attack) is because it bypasses shields (yay!) and does damage to a lot of enemies at once.  Now that's all well and good, doing a ""lot of damage"" (not actually all that much) and all that, but it's all spread out.

"Kaguya_sama","t5_3ihr1","I love this series. I really love this series LMFAAAOOOO what a riot of a chapter. Like everything about it was perfect. 

But I have to start with this, Kashiwagi, man I never really cared for her character. She was good for comedic reactions of the crazy shit she would hear from these wacky characters and some of the situations she would be in with her boyfriend when they would get caught almost fucking, but like over the last maybe 3 times she's appeared she has risen as a very likeable character for me. Lmaoo this is by far their best interaction together. 

And Kaguya lmaoo she was so baka, so cute, so wholesome. She's so in love she can't help it lol I wonder if someone is gonna tell her how advanced the shit she's saying is, about going to miyuki's house and the miso soup shit 😂 (jus a random ps, this shit is more hilarious knowing the full meaning behind that, and this is the 2nd time I've heard about it. Oregairu being the 1st, 8man telling saika that). Poor hayasaka, good thing she running away. Kaguya would probably fucking kill her with all this lol the call back to the booby grab chapter 👏  👏  👏  really, never would've thought that would be recalled at all. Burst out laughing seeing that panel. Went back and reread it, is still freaking great. 

Kashiwagi does have a point though.. if eventually it comes (lul) to that point, maybe when they can't be together due to college 👀, when she starts to feel that she might want to have SE... lmao love that that came back. When she might want to have sex, that could be a disaster. OR she will learn from the disaster that will be when she watches that DVD, because that's OBVIOUSLY gonna be some fucking weird stuff she's gonna watch lol really, kashiwagi? From your mom's collection? Lmaooo you don't know what kind of freak she is.  Ohh sweet summer child kaguya.

 And lmaooo iino is slowly being revealed to a probably big pervert. She's either watching them because she confiscated them and got curious and well.. liked it, or just a closet pervert lol either way,  I hope it's not something darker like it usually is with our poor girl lol also idk if she's healed already, I think it was just a mistake.

In fact, it seems most dangerous products include some kind of warning label.

I don't think I would argue against the placement of a warning label on something like a wood chipper, a dangerous chemical product, or a drug like acetaminophen. I guess one of the questions to ask is: what kind of products should include warning labels?

This is my guild right now, we're 8/10 MC and 1/1 Onyxia, we have new people, Pserver people and we have done two MCs and two Onyxias , the first one with like 10 pugs, the second one with 3 pugs and next week hopefully with no pugs.

I feel like we're too slow, this is my first time raiding in Classic but AFAIK MC should take 2 hours, it takes us 2 days. We raid from 8:30 to 11:30 two days, on our first raid we got 5/10 the first day and 8/10 the second day, on our second raid we got 6/10 the first day and 8/10 the second day, that was mostly due to people not having Aqual Quintessence and having people go out mid raid, then getting them in, it was a shitshow and we tried to do Domo with like 30 people and didnt work out, our strat wasn't the best either and was based on Pserver info.

We have some full Pre-Bis gear but most are 50% and a few have like 10% Pre-Bis, we also have some MC gear/t2 heads thanks to the two raids that we have done and we arent using consumables, next week they're obligatory and we're doing loot council and all that because we finally have a core but im wondering if our problem isn't that but actually that the composition is garbage, i mean i've seen videos of people doing speed runs with like 20 Fury warriors, we have 2. I've seen top end guilds with 1 druid and we have 3, locks do basically no DPS but we have 5 for Garr, we also have 3 hunters and most guilds have only 2, we even had an Enh for one raid but that guy is not coming back.

And then are habitually late, they'll just get around to it when convenient for them alone. That's another reason the article is one sided, for it does not look at all sides of the proverbial coin.

I like the principles of christianity, but I have a few issues with it. One of the issues is that 800 years ago my country was invaded by people who were spreading christianity and destroying my countries culture. A lot of people died in those wars, and eventually we lost. It is a very sensitive topic, just like colonization in America. Most of the issues with christianity are because of the forced, brutal way it was spread.

I don't mind if people are religious or in what god they believe in, I don't like when people try to push their beliefs.

1) How smooth is each component? I've seen some videos where the slider, pan and tilt are all working together flawlessly, and other videos where even just the pan on it's own is jittery. What's your experience?  


2) The main reason for purchase will be for VFX work - repeating the same movement mulitiple times. Obviously, for this the movement has to be 100% exact each time. Is this the case, and have you used it for any VFX?  


3) Here's a YouTube link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSKqmJs\_CRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSKqmJs_CRA)   
At 4min 44secs there's a shot where a girl picks up a mug - the cam then slides, pans and tilts to her face, then continues to slide pan and tilt to the guy across the room. In the video they're using the motion kit, but if I'm understanding stuff correctly shouldn't a sliderone and 2 headone units be able to produce the same shot (obviously without the rack focus)? Will that shot be possible with your setup?

"Monero","t5_31hbr","On the whole it's only the most sophisticated investors that understand how to use derivative products. For the rest, it's pure gambling (this is statistically accurate).

The amount of influence you can introduce into the system through derivatives is pretty extraordinary. Throwing a ""focused with intent"" 100x leverage behind a bet ensures that the most sophisitcated investors can throw their weight around more easily. Ultimately this can only result in giving them more control of the Monero price/market. 

These financial products do not concern anybody here that I know of.

"TrueCrime","t5_2s5e8","There was a podcast that hosted several people who Ashley plagiarized from, but I listened to it several months ago and unfortunately I can’t find it. If you look up “crime junkie plagiarism” it should give you plenty of articles though. 

Basically the gist of the podcast was specific instances where Ashley or Britt would read, verbatim, a post or script from a previous podcast or Reddit post. They all gave several examples of this happening. The majority of the time they contacted Crime Junkies and they just quietly removed the specific episode with plagiarism. 

Ashley posted something recently about how they always cite their sources, and if they could no longer access a source they removed the episode, but to my understanding these were the plagiarized episodes they were called out on. 

Really wish I could find the podcast exposing the plagiarism, it was really detailed and shed a lot of light on the subject. If I find it I’ll send it your way.

Edit:just found it! [sauce](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bonus-episode-lets-taco-bout-crime-junkie-plagiarism/id1452118167?i=1000447888185)",1572566415

3) The gambit meta is machine guns, he aint killing because he is trying to invade using non machine guns/snipers so he gets wrecked instantly unless he is using dawnblade or some other roaming super but still wont be able to hit worth a shit

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","No there is a deep flaw in your thinking. Not only is league a million branch skill tree that any 100 points in will likely get you to gold with, but it’s also played by players who play vastly different amounts. 

This leads to two things

1. the chances you meet people with the same skills you have, is close to 0 below fairly high elo. And no I wouldn’t count much of the playerbase high elo, including me. 

2. some people might win 10 games due to a mix of skill and luck as their only games this season, while someone else might have played 1000 games this season in the exact same shithole of an elo. From the data we have, we can only say that it looks like they are about even skill, as they beat similar opponents. The 10-0 dude is likely still going to be better than the other guy, but we can’t know. Maybe the 1000 game guy is better. The only way we can know is to make the 10 game guy play 990 more games while not letting the other guy play. But then patches are in between and the game changes, requiring the skill to adjust, which we can never get any data on from a single game. 

All in all too many aspects play into league of legends and your skill at the game. A single game is never enough data to make any estimates on players skill. That’s why the start of the season is a fiesta. Very little data, a lot of players that play in different frequencies but at similar overall skill levels. 

You limit your view on certain aspects ignoring that league isn’t just what you see, but much more. You ignore relevant aspects of solo queue climbing and claim the system is flawed. You just don’t understand it at all, that doesn’t make it flawed.",1572566417

"cinematography","t5_2ri38","It was so great to get back to directing again! For the past two years I’ve really been working on my screenwriting and overall filmmaking techniques. Always making things here and there and, of course, constantly watching movies. I’ve been able to crank out a couple of feature drafts and treatments but haven’t gotten a chance to actually direct something because I’m always so busy. It’s still great to be able to make movies on paper, but it’s so much more rewarding seeing the pages come to life. As much as I love the limitless possibilities when writing a screenplay, my heart lies in directing. ‘Instant’ isn’t driven by a script and before we shot it, I really only had a shot list together that laid out the plot. I had a blast last weekend making this short with some of the best, most supportive, and patient friends. I’ll be submitting it for college applications within the next month or so as well as some film festivals but I figured I’d share it all with you here! It’s a quick watch at 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The requirement was that it couldn’t contain dialogue and that is had to show a character making a choice. The genre I decided to go with was “film noir” as I wanted to show an antihero making a choice and have it be a choice that is deteriorating to his character. I aimed to make it most-similar in style and tone to the classic noirs of the ‘40s which was a fun experience! There’s a pinch of horror thrown in midway so dropping it on Halloween seemed most-appropriate. 😄 I encourage anyone who’d like to offer your feedback in the comments!

I definitely feel like my issue so far has been wildly aping hoping I can almost just land on top of them and shotgun them either before they can react or get the shots in themselves. It’s been working to some success against lower skilled players, but similarly skilled players and higher definitely aren’t having any of it. I think it’s mostly down to testing out stomps capabilities (after being a pretty ground orientated outside of blink warlock for so long) and not being practiced enough. I got real good at juking opponents with blink, and this has somewhat carried over with strafe jump, but I’d still like to be able to use it offensively rather than a ‘oh shit fucked that up, better jump around to confuse them and get away’.

"singing","t5_2rlcx","Perfect voices simply do not exist. While some people do have an amazing natural resonance or singing ability, I guarantee someone out there will find their voices whiny, annoying, too this, or too that. 

As far as developing a unique voice, I don't know. I think when people figure out how to coordinate their voice in different ways, their singing voice will almost certainly develop and change over time. But it's hard to pin down what will make each person's voice unique.

I used to think Freddy Mercury had a unique voice. But nowadays with the internet and all these ways to share videos and music, I've seen quite a few people that are able to sound similar or quite close to what he did with his voice. And chances are a lot of these people who figured out how to sound like Freddy probably didn't sound like him at first but practiced for hours and hours to achieve as similar sound.

So on one hand, it's possible to practice and shape a voice to try to get closer to maybe a Rock &amp; Roll sound, blues, R&amp;B, etc. But there's also the fact that there will be natural qualities of someone's voice like inherent raspiness, deep baritonal quality (crooners like Sinatra or Engelbert Humperdinck), and so on. 

Can everyone develop a perfect voice? I don't think so. Can everyone develop a unique voice? Possibly. There's a lot of different things that can make someone's voice unique and stand out from everyone else's, but there's not really a cut-and-dry criteria for just what exactly that might be.",1572566420

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","I don’t mind Standard Array either — the reason why I strongly prefer not rolling stats is because it has the potential to imbalance the game. A PC who rolls under will likely feel pretty awful about it and a PC that rolls over can end up with an extra ASI or more which is an insane difference in power VS the norm.

For example, a Half-Orc Barbarian with Point Buy seeking to max out their Str and Con only has room for 1 feat by LV20. This may go to GWM or PAM or Sentinel or Lucky for example, but they simply don’t have the space for all of them without a steep opportunity cost and I think that’s by design.

Opportunity cost means players have to choose carefully and weigh carefully what they want to do with that character rather than just being able to “take it all” and I like that. Fighters sort of can do that, but that’s also one of their core selling points (more feats/ASI). Point Buy/SA also mean players are balanced with each other in a fair way and the players still get to make interesting choices about their stats so I like it a lot more VS rolling.",1572566421

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Hmm....okay.  I'll argue for this CMV that the death penalty serves two unique functions that no other punishment can provide.

First, it provides a ""worse"" punishment than life in prison, that society may want to reserve for the ""worst"" crimes (child murder, mass killings, etc.).  Life in prison is no joke, but, you can be sentenced to life in prison for things that are not killing other human beings---including non-violent crimes like major financial crimes.  If society wants to say, ""well, killing other humans deserves the *worst* possible punishment,"" the death penalty allows that message in a way that no other punishment can.

Second, deterrence.  Sure, it's highly unlikely a serial killer will escape from jail.  But people do escape from jail.  And certainly, people in jail kill other inmates or prison guards.  When dealing with the edge case of a serial-killer type, the only way to *be sure* that a Ted Bundy won't ever harm any other person again is the death penalty.",1572566421

"TeamTrees","t5_26jvkb","&gt;That sounds quite interesting. Now my logic here might be very flawed or I might have misunderstood you, but while calculating the time left for goal, I guess we’d have to account for the change in donation rate trends over time or maybe use cumulative donation by total time to show a more accurate estimated projection, rather than based on rate from a segment, though it’ll still be very much random as there a lot of factors affecting donation rates.

Yes, of course :D This was more like ""if we could maintain the last hour's (or whatever segment you pick) rate we'd be done by X"". It's obviously not an accurate prediction in any sense, unless the donation rate could somehow be kept constant, which isn't realistic.

Still you can take some conclusions by looking at something like the hourly donation rate. We wouldn't want it to be steadily declining, of course, though it's probably a likely scenario as time goes on (well, you never know if someone like Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos will just decide to get this over with :P)

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","Don't worry about a home in the current situation.   You are really in no rush.  Every dollar you save is a dollar you don't give to the bank.  

On average for a loan of 100k you end up paying about the same in interest. That's quite painful. 

You have just got your life around.  Improve your mental outlook on life first.  Don't worry too much about what you should be doing or the level you are at.  Be happy with where you are.  

Don't worry about home prices Passing you by. 

The best thing you can do is look at your finances and understand what is essential and what isn't.  Small changes end up being big changes.  
What is money if not a way to measure output.  So saving money comes in multiple ways.  One easy way is to look at your outgoings.  What can you reduce the cost of.  Lower Mobile phone bill and internet bill , minimising debt, reducing bills, buying products you use constantly on special and in bulk, spending less on food where possible, looking after your health, improving your qualifications and education.  These are all investments in the long term.  
These little things add up.  Suddenly you are saving an extra $2000 a year without doing very much.  If you think about it in terms of return, you would need to have About 30k in a fund returning 9% per annum to get similar returns.  

Next is saving.  Aim to look at your outgoings and decide how much you can save.  It's easier to save with more money. But work it out in percentages.  Start small.  Say 20% of your income to start and then all those small change might boose it up a bit.  

Start by getting a slush fund.  I would say 5k is a good amount.  And then keep going. Once you save about 10k.  I would start looking into getting into shares.   If you find you have spare money left over.  Take a further 10% of your wage and put it into a more relaxed savings account. It's there for not only a rainy day, but say if you want to go on holiday or buy something nice.  

In terms of getting into shares. Some general advice. It's not a short term thing.  We are on turbulent times and no one is sure what's going to happen in the short term.  But long term those turbulences get factored out. So think about putting money into shares as basically throwing that money away short term and then say winning the lottery long term.  

I'm a big fan of CommSec pocket for first timers.  It's simple to use, cheap and has the main stuff you need.  I would start basic and just get into investing into the asx200 over the long run.  Maybe $1000 a month after you get to 10k, keep saying the same and putting away 1000 a month.  You will have some lean times and some good times. But they should general average out. This is of course not without risk.  Japan for instance still hasn't recovered from its all time high in the 1990s, but on average if you keep doing small amounts consistently. You might eat a big lose one or two years but long term you will come out ahead, even if you had been a Japanese investor and kept doing regular investment in the long term you would eventually come out ahead(in japans case it would be possibly 30+ years, which is why slow and steady and long term is important).",1572566424

One guy was walking with his dog, we asked him nicely to put his dog on a leash. Straight up told me to go fuck myself. We drove by him later and he flipped us off. We went back to our base to take dinner, we were eating with a detective of environmental police. He bursted through the door yelling at us claiming we were driving by him harassing, we were just conducting our usual patrol. The detective pulled him outside threatened to fine him for several different things such as failure to comply with a state official and etc.


Another time (so I am finishing a degree in archaeology) there was a man who was metal detecting in a swimming zone (we have a beach in our park) and I nicely informed him that he is not allowed to metal detect in state parks. So he insists I state to him which law says he can’t. Because I am very familiar with my state’s looting laws from school and state parks regulations I listed off several state statutes and state park rules. Which considered him a looter, which banned metal detecting on state property without a permit, which bans digging up state property, and bans pretty much doing anything but swimming in dedicated swimming zones. So he promptly told me to fuck off and said I’m nothing but a fucking trash picker. Which was cool, and he got fined.

"WoWs_Legends","t5_ogkyd","You have picked the toughest line to play, but I think the most fun and rewarding. 

If you’re new to the game hone your skills at lvl 4 and 5 both fun tiers for a while, get some experienced commanders and rank them up also. T5 is the best money earning tier also. 

Your role as a cruiser (CL) is to support your Battleships (BB). 

Don’t get to aggressive early and stick with your BB’s. In the early stages, allow your BB’s to engage with other BB’s and once the shooting starts lay down support fire on their targets. Of course if you get a early juicy target unload, but it helps to not be too aggressive at the start. Set fires with HE rounds and switch to AP when you get a nice broad side target.

After the first 1-3 minutes have unfolded you should see more enemy CL’s around and in range, these are your primary targets. If they are showing their broadsides smack them with AP, aim for the waterline and hit around the engine room, smoke stacks 😉If they’re coming front on then switch to HE to burn them.

While all this is going on you need to be keeping an eye out for destroyers (DD’s) which are the main threats to your BB’s. If you see these little bastards hit them hard and fast with HE. AP will do damage but will often over penetrate so where possible use HE on DD’s.

If you see smoke pop in close proximity to you and your ship has the ability, pop sonar to detect incoming torps and this will also spot them for your team. A spotter plane may also help spot DD’s along with other enemy ships.

Unfortunately not every battle plays out like this as you are playing with random people, but if you can stick with your team it makes a big difference. What is the saying ‘team work makes the dream work’ or something like that. 

When in your cruiser try to keep front on and angle you tail out to use the rear guns. Staying front on will make you a smaller target, and if you have a slight angle, rounds will bounce off your hull and not penetrate in some instances. 

Never expose your broadside where possible, not always the case obviously, but if you do have to do it, make it a calculated risk. For example you need to haul ass away from a BB. Wait until he fires his mains before you turn and run. Hopefully he is reloading while you are exposing your broad side to turn away. Once you are on the run keep switching your heading ever so slightly, turning in one direction, then back to the other. This is called kiting, and switch to your HE and try set fires to the guy who is chasing you.

Also try not to show boardside when close to another CL 😬

- This game is a lot about positioning so use your mini map and put yourself in areas that will benefit your damage output. Sinking the enemy is important but pouring on damage is the key.

- use your BB’s for cover

- use islands for cover

- always check the enemy roster to see who you are up against before the rounds starts.

These are just a few tips, check out Tbull’s channel on YouTube, he is excellent and has some great videos from beginners to pros. He also has a really good discord channel with great conversations and advice, and also a place to join up in a squad which makes the game a lot more fun. You can learn a lot from squad mates too. 

Most of all have fun. It is a excellent game.

One the surface it is pretty simple, drive, point, shoot, but beneath the layers it is a complex version of rock, paper, scissors and that makes it great fun although sometimes frustrating. Keep going though and you will get the hang of it.

Good luck out there.",1572566425

3. Worst of all. After the cast was taken off, I was told to walk on it. The pain was indescribable.

Do I know you? No, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh... excuse me. I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister. Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I need to have someone taken care of. - Who's the guy? - Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um... He's an ogre. [crowd gasp] Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed. Where could I find him? [knock on door] Hello? Who dares enter my room? Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but I'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem? You are told correct. But for this, I charge a great deal of money. Would... this be enough? You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre. [ Eels: I Need Some Sleep] [snoring] [chimes] Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says you've just gotta let it go You just gotta let it go I need some sleep Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep And the wheels keep spinning round Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. [plays tune] Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go. He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I'm going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. [echoing] Mrs. Fiona Charming. [knock on door] Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book. I was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. - Okay... - I don't know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... - Look, Your Majesty, I just... - Please. Call me Dad. Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other. Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona. [sighs] Shall we say, : by the old oak? [birds twitter] [Shrek] Face it, Donkey! We're lost. We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly. ""Head to the darkest part of the woods..."" ""Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches."" - The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! - We passed that three times already! You were the one who said not to stop for directions. Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and I end up lost in the woods with you! Don't get huffy! I'm only trying to help. I know! I know. - I'm sorry, all right? - Hey, don't worry about it. I just really need to make things work with this guy. Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy. [purring] [purring] Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring? What? I ain't purring. Sure. What's next? A hug? Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a... Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! [hisses] Look! A little cat. - Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! - It's a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. - [screaming] - Whoa! - Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming! - Come on! Get it off! Get it off! Oh, God. Oh... No! - Look out, Shrek! Hold still! - Get it off! Shrek! Hold still! - Did I miss? - No. You got them. Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from... Puss... in Boots! I'll kill that cat! Ah-ha-ha! [coughs] [wheezes] [retches] [coughs] - [chuckles] Hairball. - Oh! That is nasty! What should we do with him? Take the sword and neuter him. Give him the Bob Barker treatment. Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Señor. I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father paid you to do this? The rich King? Sí. [screams] Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing. Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. Gee, thanks. Maybe Fiona would've been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming. That's what the King said. Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me. Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her. Well, it's not like I wouldn't change if I could. I just... I just wish I could make her happy. Hold the phone... ""Happiness."" ""A tear drop away."" Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you! Aw, man, where do I begin? First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going ""Piñata!!"" What is a piñata, anyway? No, Donkey! I need you to cry! Don't go projecting on me. I know you're feeling bad, but you got to... Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of... What? Is it on? Is it on? [clears throat] This is Fairy Godmother. I'm either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment. Have a ""happy ever after."" Oh... Are you up for a little quest, Donkey? That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo! We're on the move! - Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you. - Join the club. We've got jackets. On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine. The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. Let's go, Shrek. Shrek? - Shrek! - Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. - Let's keep him! - Say what? [purrs] Ahh! Listen. He's purring! - Oh, so now it's cute. - Come on, Donkey. Lighten up. Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! [giggles] Shrek! [barks] [barks] Shrek? They're both festive, aren't they? What do you think, Harold? Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine. [sighs] Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball. Honestly, Lillian, I don't think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball? Mom. Dad. - Oh, hello, dear. - What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming. Mom, have you seen Shrek? I haven't. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He's a little slow this morning. - Can I help you, Your Majesty? - Ah, yes! Um... Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish? That would be the dog's breakfast, Your Majesty. Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric. - Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? - No, I haven't, dear. I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night. Oh. You heard that, huh? The whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute. Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. Well, what did you expect? Look at what he's done to you. Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you'd be happy for me.

Being an overweight teenage girl is hard (been there) but having your father tell you to lose weight, nicely or not, helpful or not, is hard to hear.(been there).
My dad suggested I try to lose weight and go to the gym with him and eat healthy, this CRUSHED my self esteem. I was already sensitive about my weight and to hear my father point it out killed me. I never felt so ashamed of the way I looked.
So her reaction I would say, for a teenage girl, is honestly something to expect(even if it's wrong to rect that way). You offering help to get her healthy is honestly so good of you. My post is not to say she was in the right, but to give some insight on how a teenage girl would see your advise, and to help understand why she might react that way.",1572566427

if i camp you can do tactical all you want.

i start with a good position with enough map control so im not getting avoided and get 2-3 kills easy then i got your attantion. 

i back of from my window and listen for you in a corner (easy with new dead silince). you come in, i kill you or my claymore.

next time you think you are smart and tactical and throw your grenade stuff. But suprise im in another room or have the tacmask in a diffrent corner you die again. 

next time i set up my killstreaks on your way since spawns never switch in this game i know there you coming from. 

and repeat the steps works every time, and its super easy with refilling clays, ghost, deadsilince, mounting, sniper shotguns, maps made for it.

normally im a rusher but u know adapt and stuff",1572566427

I agree with it being a know your audience issue. And while you say that a ton of teens and tweens are playing them, do you know that those in your family are those people? If you aren't really sure that it would be enjoyed, then it would probably be seen more as trying to overspend even though you didn't, and that it is just showing off. But if you bring it genuinely thinking someone will have a good time with it, people may or may not still feel that way (with the knowing your audience as to if you think the value would make others feel inferior or not.), but you could be happy knowing your gift went to a good home.

When we had a Yankee Swap in my family, I often had items more valuable than the limit, but I always get amazing deals at my job, and it was never made a big deal.

If something that is necessary is also immoral that makes morality somewhat futile.

I don not see that we have a responsibility to technologically manipulate nature to make it more moral. That is quite hubristic. 

It is a strange moral paradigm if you suggest we have to use science and technology to morally improve ourselves and nature. I don't see where this moral imperative would come from.

Once you reach 80 you have the choice between scrip gear and crafted gear, the scrip gear has better baseline stats, but is critically lacking in CP, while the crafted gear has slightly lower basestats but you can meld materia to it and reach much higher CP numbers.

We had the company activate an intruder mode that closes the lid during training for any cat that is not authorized. But they can still run by and swipe out food.

&gt;I'm not so onboard with the second part, doubling the cost of the house. Do you really want to buy a house worth 10 years income?

Can you expand your thoughts on this.  How much do think is reasonable.  Right now Im not thinking about what I can get for 800k.  I am trying to think more along the lines of how I can take advantage of low interest rates and maximize any profits I can make.  

The longer term plan is to sell the house once the kids are out and down size.  Then I can pocket any money I made and put it towards the down sized home.",1572566432

&gt; Giuliani showed up at the San Francisco store after being locked out of his iPhone, just 26 days after Trump named him cybersecurity advisor, NBC News reported Thursday, citing interviews with two sources and an internal Apple Store memo.

&gt; As for his 2017 appearance in San Francisco, a former Apple employee who was at the store when Giuliani sought help told NBC that the former presidential contender was waiting outside the store&amp;#039;s glassy facade when it opened at 10 a.m. that morning.

&gt; While black t-shirt-clad employees at the San Francisco store said Thursday they couldn&amp;#039;t talk to a reporter or hadn&amp;#039;t heard about the Giuliani news, shoppers and tourists had a laugh over Giuliani&amp;#039;s iPhone woes.

Morally you feel guilty because you feel you betrayed the old relationship because you had not let an arbitrary period of time (math = relationship time/time before sleeping with A N Other) pass before you slept with someone else.

Ask yourself how much time you owed the embers of your relationship when you look back. 

None of this is his business anymore, the only person you have to hold to any standard is yourself.

If your happy you did the right thing, that's it

I know how much getting under someone else helped me get over my ex, I lost 80% of the baggage overnight, I hold zero guilt because i owed my last relationship, 0 days, 0 hours and 0 seconds of ""waiting time""",1572566432

Having Kyler Murray wouldn't have changed anything. This year isn't just a scheme thing. It's a different coaching staff, there's zero off the field drama, and dudes are just playing looser. This year is the polar opposite of last year, with one exception, and that would be talent. That is why we have a chance to win it all. Also, how many Cards games have you watched? I live in Phoenix, and have watched all of them. Kyler Murray is not playing at some All-Pro level. He's playing okay, and doing better as the season progresses. College qbs that translate seamlessly into the NFL as rookies are beyond rare. He has made PLENTY of poor choices, bad throws, mistakes, etc. He is nowhere near the polished plug and play allstar you seem to think he is. And like was said earlier, you can't compare Haskins to Murray as rookies. Murray came in knowing he was starting this year. He spent the entirety of his time since he got here practicing with the first team, pouring over everything with the coaches and starters, and generally had everything he could have possibly needed to be ready to go. Haskins started the season as the backup to the backup. He got thrown into a game with little to no preparation with the first team offense, and only idiots expected miracles. There's a reason the best qbs in the league ride the bench their first year or two. There is a serious learning curve from the collegiate level to the Pros. More so at the qb position than any other. Haskins will be just fine in a uear or so, would be my guess. Only time will tell which of the 2 will perform better in the NFL.",1572566433

My point is that if there is a thing, people who know more about that thing are in a better position to judge its quality. It doesn't matter if that's music, art, baking cookies, cars or philosophy. 

Saying it's elitist to think art can be judged objectively is actually even more elitist. It sounds like a 12 year old who just discovered Philosophy and is high on some weed. 

It may sound profound and deep to say something like ""everything is subjective""...   but it's actually just another way of sounding smart without thinking it through. 

There is something like objective quality in art and film.  Implying otherwise would mean there is no skill in acting, no skill in editing, no skill in directing, no skill in writing, no skill in sound design.... it would all be just subjective. It's an insult to the whole industry.",1572566435

I mean if a highschool is well off enough to have a robotics team of such caliber they can take side projects then they may be more well off then you'd think. 

&gt; Your entire argument revolves around ignoring how fucked up heath coverage is for a majority of US citizens

My entire argument was discussing why cost per unit goes down as the number of units increases. See the post above mine. 

&gt; Health should not be a business. “Break even”. Who gives a fuck? They don’t need to make money on everything. There are plenty of things they make money on already, and obscene amounts over actual costs.

Even government healthcare opportunities won't pay for certain operations if they're deemed unlikely to fail [here's an example](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/25/health/alfie-evans-appeal-bn/index.html).

"bipolar2","t5_31khp","What in my opinion is such a devastating aspect of our condition is being unable to distinguish between what we actually feel and what is felt as a symptom. I just posted something about the same thing.

Last fall I organized to transfer from one warehouse to another in a city an hour and a half away, set up a place to live with a roommate, and enrolled in classes for a degree at one of the colleges in town. A month or month and a half later I called everything off. I feel like I looked ridiculous. I felt humiliated in a way. Sometimes the only way I feel like I can commit to something is by rushing into it full speed. The obvious problem with that is the incredible risk of making some huge mistake.

Being a full-time musician has been a long-standing dream of mine. It's been an absolute tug-of-war trying to find music's place in my life. Is it a career? A hobby? A passion project? Throughout all of this uncertainty of which move I want to make (or not make), the thing that remains consistent is I really do love music. I love listening to it. I love playing instruments. I love making songs. What gets in the way of enjoying music fully are the unbelievable expectations of success I set for myself which ultimately end up making me feel incompetent, not the fact that I don't enjoy it in the first place.

Hopefully there's at least one thing in there that offers some insight. That question is a constant battle.",1572566438

IIRC 200stacks per 10mins is good, if it’s a harder matchup then maybe 130-150 is alright. So by the 30 minute mark you should have 500+ stacks at the very least.

Last tip is to freeze, freeze and freeze the wave again. 2 reasons for this 

1: it keeps you oh so safe, the way you beat nasus is you punish his weak early game and delay his dmg long enough to win the game.

2: it’s easy to farm a frozen wave, just last hit with Q and punish with Q if they try to cs.",1572566439

Pants were developed for riding on horses while staying warm, probably long before agriculture and any decently large civilization beyond hunter-gatherers. Because riders straddle the horse, they needed something to wrap around each leg individually to keep them warm in cold weather. Otherwise both men and women of that early era wore skirts, robes and frock-like clothing. And because both men and women rode horses until civilization took off (and women could acquire lives of leisure that didn't necessitate working with horses), pants were a largely gender-neutral piece of clothing.

If pants had any prohibitions, it was probably job-contextual -- if you weren't riding a horse or were expecting to do so, you probably changed out of the pants into something more flexible and freeing for the legs.",1572566439

It's like asking a native American to speak about the trial of tears, or a New Yorker to speak about 9/11. The perspective of a Christian preacher on evolution is not relevant.

You keep bringing up this evolution angle.  It's apples to oranges. 

I think I should get it out of the way, I agree with your point that person complaining was a ""Karen"", that the school had non-optional classes that covered the Holocaust, and that the chief disagreement was over whether the optional class should be mandatory. 

I think insisting that he couldn't or shouldn't acknowledge whether the Holocaust actually happened, even though it's taught in other courses that it did happen, was an absurd self-inflicted wound by the principle. 

I also disagree with the idea that a rabbi discussing the Holocaust telling children that the Holocaust was wrong, and that genocide is wrong in a broader context, is too controversial or subjective or politically motivated to be part of the curriculum at a public school. I disagree with the idea that a public school should not teach any ethics, and even if I didn't, the idea that teaching that murdering 6 million Jews and 5 million other people is was immoral and unethical is taking that idea to an absurd extreme. If you liberal or libertarian thinks telling children genocide is wrong is some taboo, they are also fucking Karens.",1572566440

It's not likely that we came from ""water monkeys"", but more likely that some group of primates was forced into the water for an extended period of time. There has been evidence in the fossil record of ash and fire across large parts of the earth a various times, so if there was some huge plains fire in Africa, it may have forced many species into the water.

The next question is how would evolution apply to this situation? In terms of best fit, being covered in here is *not* helpful when you spend most of your time in the water. This would evolutionarily push us towards losing that hair, as the hairless primates would find it easier to swim and move between air and water.

So it's possible that we are the descendants of some group that was forced to live in an environment that was not conducive to being covered in hair.

Again, I cannot state enough, this is not something I know for sure or have researched heavily. I've heard pieces of information, and I apply my knowledge of biology and evolution to the events. This seems like a logical progression to me, but it's based on my own interpretation of things. If anyone has more info, please share!",1572566440

That's the point of boners, right?

Anyway, you don't need to overthink all this.  Just be aware that the unlimited mountain of streaming online porn is really addictive, poisonous, and not actually what sex with someone you care about is (true sex, the experience, doesnt make for entertaining porn, but makes for some of the best experiences in human existence)

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","From one guy to another, my main advice is to just get over yourself. Seriously. You're uncomfortable with feminism? I could understand a legit phobia to spiders or blood or anything like that but feminism?

You've made the first mistake by thinking feminism is in any way a threat to you, which is why the average anti feminist man is made uncomfortable by what feminism stands for. 

I'll link some videos when I'm on my computer after work but I'd just either talk to women or lurk feminist subs for a while. This lets you have women explain with their own words how the world treats them. But you got to let go of your ego.

Edit: I recommend this video series by MalmroseProject, it's very gaming focused, but as far as history and feminism goes, I think it's a good series because how gaming spaces become hostile to women and other groups really has some parallels to how it happens in other spaces like even within workplaces and families.

Make no mistake, they were every bit as bad twenty years ago as they are today.  They were not a news channel that gradually worked its way into this niche.  The entire network was designed, from day 1, to be exactly what it is today.  They were all smirking at ""Fair and Balanced"" from the outset.  

This is like a serial killer who, after his twentieth victim, sees the error of his ways.  ""There I was feeding #14 ever so slowly into the wood chipper, relishing the screams, the terror, the agony...  And suddenly it hit me.  *I* wouldn't want anyone doing this to me, right?

"anime","t5_2qh22","We start with a fun little encapsulation of the way Oreki and Fukube’s minds work: Fukube really wants the lake monster to be real because “it’s more interesting that way”, while Oreki just defaults to the less-interesting but probably correct answer. He wouldn’t normally accept going on a trip like this (I definitely feel the whole “summer break should be a break” thing) but he feels like he still owes Chitanda something. I think this is interesting, because he’s already done a huge favor to her, much bigger than agreeing to go on a trip somewhere, and like Satoshi said a couple of episodes ago about him solving the Sekitani case, no one would’ve probably really minded if he just went home, he had already done a lot after all. I think that Oreki hasn’t himself even really understood it yet, but I think here is where he starts doing things because he wants to, not out of some kind of obligation. 

I’ve always liked how this show uses these sorts of fixed camera angles, like there’s someone with an actual camera in the room. It always feels very intimate, like we’re actually right along there with the cast, which I think really adds to the sort of intimate feeling that the series has. I think this series has some really fantastic camera work in general, Replay Value likes to go into great depth about this aspect. 

For some reason the “summer break trip” SoL cliche almost always delivers for me. I just like to see these characters get to have fun! Also, Ponytail Chitanda is always cute. 

There are a lot of great quiet Oreki/Chitanda character moments in this episode, where we get to see their personality contrasts in a context in which they’re already established friends. Besides the always-pretty lighting and color work, we get a conversation that made me relfect on my own life a little bit. I’m the oldest sibling, and so so much of my childhood has been defined by that experience. Chitanda’s experience as an only child is totally foreign to me, and so it’s interesting to see that perspective on things. I’ve never had Oreki’s experience of being a younger sibling to someone like Tomoe, but I do kinda get what he says lol, being a sibling can be great but also sometimes it can be a bit of a wild ride. 

Naturally, since this is an anime, we’re going to have some bathhouse shenanigans. Great as Hyouka is, we still gotta sneak some Anime Bullshit in there somewhere. Still, gotta give points to this sequence, which I think is funny as all hell. Props to the creative censorship, and more fun character moments with Oreki and Satoshi, and then Oreki, erm, having a bit of a moment. He’s already got it really bad for Chitanda and hasn’t quite figured it out yet, which is always fun to watch, and for all his above-it-all bluster he is still a 15-year-old guy with pretty friends. I definitely know that feeling lol. Never passed out in a hot spring over it, but that’s anime for you. The real highlight is Chitanda accidentally making things even worse afterwards, which is *definitely* something I empathize with for the both of them. 
Another real highlight of Hyouka in general are the animations of the different stories or theories for all the mini-mysteries, and a good old haunted-inn ghost story is never a bad thing. What a perfectly spooky episode for Halloween! I wonder if this rewatch timing was deliberate for this, but even if it isn’t, this is great. I also remember the “mystery” this episode being one of the more interesting ones in the show, and definitely one of the better ones of the one-offs. I’ve always enjoyed finding natural solutions for supernatural questions, it’s a particular soft spot of mine! Let’s get Oreki, skeptic extraordinaire, on this case. Bonus: the rare and highly effective double “watashi kiniarimasu”.

Shots where characters move from foreground to background and vice versa (and sometimes even back again) is also a super Hyouka thing and I love to see it, it always looks really cool. I like how Chitanda’s people skills work really well with Oreki’s detective work, to make up for each other’s weaknesses. I just love these two, OK? 

Anime food shots right before lunch is also certainly an experience. It’s not quite like watching Sangatsu no Lion on an empty stomach but man that looks pretty good. Satoshi being a) a snob about random things that very few people actually care about and b) knowing lots of useless information is absolutely me_irl. I relate a lot to aspects of all four main characters, which will definitely come up again later in the series when we explore them a bit more. 

Have I mentioned that this show has great color work? Because it has fantastic color work. The evening light is so natural and pretty-looking. Also, win for even more fun censorship. 

The solution to the case is really neat, and honestly pretty cute. The solution sequences are always a joy to watch, as we get to see Oreki being awesome, see some cool visually interesting animation, and see some seemingly inconsequential details become important. The whole dynamic between Kayo and Rie feels pretty true-to-life: I love my siblings and we all get along well, even if sometimes we have personality clashes that lead to minor sticking points. The ending scene is gorgeous, definitely one of the prettiest visual moments in a series full of them-the shot of Chitanda with the dappled light from the trees especially, and the shot of Oreki with the wide-open sunset sky is also really awesome. But it’s also pretty for the character moments, the little reflection on what it means to be family. Chitanda’s imagined perfect siblings don’t exist, like ghosts, but it’s also still better than Oreki’s cynical outlook, and sometimes something that’s a little bit imperfect is still beautiful because of it. 

This is among my favorite one-off episodes, with some great character moments for Chitanda especially, some real funny moments, a ton of heart, and the usual amazing visual and sound direction. It’s a great episode to just come back and watch no strings attached. Next up is the second major arc, which was my least favorite of the three extended arcs when I first watched, but we’ll if it changes now, especially now I know how it ends, and the massive impact that it has on the characters going forward.",1572566441
"widowers","t5_2swuk","I can't yet part with his wedding suit. It's not a tux, he bought a new grey suit for our wedding and that's the last time it was worn.  I know I cannot keep this item.

I feel like it's a special suit and needs to go to a special charity.  I just can't bring myself to leave it at the drycleaners yet.  One day I will get there

Most of the rest of his personal items have been donated, save some that I decided to keep.  This was a process that took several months.

 The only other items of ""his"" are large, his favorite chair, the table he refinished, our dressers that he refinished, his tools.  I will part with most of these too as I will have to downsize.

A false venier of wealth of the entire nation whilst the overwhelming populace suffers from an unbelievable disparity in wealth amoungst our people, disguised by the metrics we developed no longer truly representing what they ought to.

Cool, the stock market is doing well? Too bad 80+% of it isn't in the hands of 99.999% of the nation.
Cool, immigration is down? Too bad it wasn't necessary to cut it down, and that we're creating the infrastructure for the possible creation of death camps.

Voter involvement is so low that only 19% of the total population voted Trump in, yet voter apathy arose from the same kind of nonsense and hard-gerrymandering done by a party constantly whining about how the process is fine ""It's the immigrants fault voting feels broken!!""

Conservatives, around the time abortion and gay marriage became a respected right, decided to stop listening because their faith came into conflict with the state, doubling down on their active destruction of the nation because they do not care about the seperation of church and state. They do not care about liberty. They do not care about freedom. They care about their idea of Christianity, ONLY. And frankly, the slow (but increasing) intersection of Conservative Christians and White Nationalism smells of the development of a white supremacist fundamentalist Christianity similar to ISIS.

The only way to secure stability is ensuring the next president will reaffirm the seperation of church and state, one who will restore the national anthem, currency, courts, and schools to a point in where a god they did not ask for is not FORCED upon the citizens.",1572566443

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","It's hard to say for sure, especially since the proletariat is largely defined by its powerlessness. Using the liberal revolutions as a model for what it looks like when a lower class seizes power for itself, it would *not* be a state that systematically excludes the bourgeoisie from power, but simply one in which the bourgeosie's traditional privileges are abolished. So most likely it would probably look like a liberal democracy but with no private property. There would be no need to explicitly outlaw pro-capitalism political parties, because for a socialist revolution to happen in the first place, such parties would have to have lost almost all of their popular support. There would almost certainly be several different leftist ideologies represented in the legislature, as well as some liberal and right-wing ones. In the event of serious active resistance by the bourgeoisie (with outside help, as an actual revolution can never be resisted by the old state) the dictatorship of the proletariat would likely break down and transform into something more authoritarian, but whether or not the bourgeoisie would actually try to seriously resist is something of a coin toss.",1572566446

"bettafish","t5_2udkc","He might've been spooked or stressed by the light. And the water is way too cold. This causes lethargy and sickness. 

Bettas need 78-80F. Grab an adjustable heater, 50W Aqueon Submersible adjustable ($17 Petsmart). Set it to 78-79 and it'll stay at 80. 

You'll also need the API Freshwater Master Kit ($22 online and Petsmart will price match) to test the water. This is a must have. In a 2.5, you'll need to do every other day wcs because smaller tanks, ammonia builds up quick. 

You need the heater definitely asap, the test kit, and getting the tank cycled. It's much easier in a 5 gal tank min. And less maintenance after the cycle as well. 

Petsmart has the TopFin 5.5 gal tank (comes w/thermometer and hang on back filter) sometimes $24 sale normally $30 OR the 10 gal kit (comes w/thermometer, filter, and heater for $40.

OR 

Right now, Petco's having their dollar per gal sale right now starting with the 10 gal for $10. Grab a lid, adj heater and filter.

Please read all links: 

Since you have your betta, you'll need to do a fish-in cycle:

Fish in cycle: https://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/wiki/fishincycle/

Care sheet: https://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/3ow6vz/info_betta_care_sheet/

Materials: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3HAJ431IB0QYY?ref_=wl_share and --&gt;5 gal bucket (new, dedicated to the tank, rinse with water only, no soap), for water changes. 

Perform parameter testing daily and PWCs (partial water changes) when ammonia or nitrites are above 0. Your goal is to have, ammonia 0, nitrites 0, nitrates 5-10.

After your cycle, 1-2x/week water changes w/the gravel vac will be good. Test parameters each time beforehand. 

Filter media info: https://imgur.com/a/7m64K6n (after your cycle, rinse the media in old tank water during water changes each week to get any gunk off and put back in the filter. Never rinse under tap). This is what I did to my filter (empty cartridge, sponges behind cut to fit, bio bag to baffle/adjust the flow, and a prefilter sponge-protects bettas' fins from getting sucked in and shredded, more space for BB to colonize, and keeps gunk from clogging up the filter): https://imgur.com/a/sNI4Yfa

How to gravel vac properly: https://youtu.be/LYv5n0a85OY

*Food: NorthFin Pellets or Fluval Bug Bites (for small fish or Betta Bites). Feed 5-6 total,  fast 1 day a week. Feed 1 at a time so there's no rotting food that sinks and spikes ammonia (2-3 in the AM, 2-3 in the PM). Then you can supplement with frozen bloodworms and mysis and brine shrimp. Use Omega One or Hikari brand for frozen foods. Cut one cube out, then open, cut a small slice, soak in a small spoon (dedicated to the tank) of tank water and feed a few pieces, and toss the rest if any in the spoon. The rest of the cube goes back in the freezer for use for about 1-2 weeks, then break out a new cube. Ex: Feed pellets in the AM, then frozen at night a few times a week to give variety. Then pellets in the AM and PM for the rest of the week.",1572566446

Okay God, what can you see into my brain? Are you magical wuwuw?? No idea how my brain works and how it functions so don’t even try to make false assumptions. 

Well not to share extremely personal information but I am heavily into BDSM and yes that is exactly the point. I want to be a handsome man’s slave. Although I prefer the term housepet over houseslave because I’m not really into the physical and mental abuse. Just being controlled and striving to make his life as easy as possible. I would never hurt an animal. I would never cut down a tree and the first time a piece of my garbage flew out the car window on accident I cried because it was the first time I technically littered. 
I’m very happy with myself and my life and I do things to improve myself for myself. It benefitting others is only a byproduct. 

I only want to hurt human beings and I only want to hurt them physically not mentally. And if I hurt someone mentally I don’t want to hurt them physically as well. Not a fantasy it is an intrusive thought that constantly lingers in my mind. Why? Because I find there to be too many humans walking this planet and to kill a few would do more good than harm for humanity as a whole. 

The only way I will ever be fully content is if somebody controls almost every aspect of my life. I’m not codependent at all in fact I actually hope my husband works all the time so I only have to see him for a portion of the day. I like my alone time. 

Of course I’m lonely. I only have the voices in my head to talk to and my dog. One can’t respond and one can only respond how my brains wants them to.",1572566446

Further, relatively few people are saying ""we should confiscate all non owner-occupier homes and redistribute them all in one go""; most people see the end of private landlords being a target to work towards over years/decades, rather than silvering we should ""just do"" (the same way we're gradually switching to greener energy or electric cars).

It's kinda disingenuous to take three most extreme version of an idea, then tie that extreme to a mostly unrelated and even more controversial issue and then claim that the other issue is a silly idea so the original idea is also had by association.

I've honestly little skin in the game, I think we should have stronger tenant rights where I live (not in the US) and that buy-to-let and similar practices (land banking) shouldn't be such a huge industry, but I'm not advocating for legally banning landlords either.",1572566447

He's had a secret life that he's been hiding from you during your entire relationship. He spent a lot of time and energy showing you one side of him, while hiding the other, and now that he's been confronted with his dark side, he refuses to acknowledge it. There's nothing you can do to help him see that his behavior is insane, abusive, and unacceptable. You can't make him admit it, and you can't make him apologize. The only thing you can do is remove yourself from the situation and refuse to be abused any further. I would suggest that you find a therapist who specializes in betrayal trauma, and do the best you can to move out as soon as possible.

For me, my issue here is two fold: One, the fact that I was 'diagnosed' with 'transsexualism' as in, they regarded it as a 'mental illness'. As in, me Being trans, my own Self, as a disease, not the dysphoria i experience, if that makes sense. And two, the fact that I was 'diagnosed' with 'transsexualism'...... by a crisis center I was at for utterly unrelated reasons, after they told me they refuse to respect or acknowledge my trans status, and after I was 'subtly' accussed of faking it and insulted over it. I wasn't ""treated"" or accommodated for being trans, it was barely discussed with me at all, I wasn't even given the most basic decency about it..... and they had the gall to """"diagnose"""" me with it and put it on my discharge papers??

That man who doesn’t like that the male sub isn’t supportive/proud of that feature? Well, either bring that up in the sub or make a new male-only or mixed-sex space to talk about that feature. They are not entitled to women’s spaces because they don’t like the men’s spaces -they truly believe that they are, though.

Fucking tired of men being like ‘I’m uncomfortable in this space so I’m going to go into the women’s space because I don’t care about their comfort’. You are not entitled to their spaces.

If you had a GF or friend or family member with that feature and wanted to study more into it then you might read the subreddit a little -still creepy, but slightly more understandable.

As clever as Boris is, there are people who are just as clever who stand in opposition.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","I think the people would take it for some time, but you'd reach some sort of of threshold at one point. Once that line is crossed, they are extremely likely to rebel. The rebellion will likely get shut down mercilessly with divine power, but at that point violence is pretty much the only option left to stop them. Coercion and fear aren't really suited as foundations to build a society on in my opinion.

However, I think assassination attempts would be a lot more likely than an open rebellion. Only if that option clearly failed, an open rebellion would take place. And if that's no longer an option, I think the people would lose faith in the gods and start to abandon their beliefs. They might even try to flee the society and build a new one of their own rule.

Mind you, not all people would go that route. The large majority would still follow their leaders unless they are exceptionally abusive. However, I think there would always be a minority, however small, that would try to rebel, no matter the consequences.

I think Socal had something like 3 Knights players. Not 100% on that statistic, but they were way down in representation.

&amp;#x200B;

Your list as it is has too much of a ""my backline is going to kill their backline"" focus. Think about this, a RG player, with 3 Invictor Warsuits, going first, is going to 3 T7 units with an angry powerfist weapon in your face on the first turn, simply because they can deploy 9"" outside your deployment zone.  You will be forced to shoot at these or they will tie up your vehicles, which means any drops they bring in, like grav devastators or anything else, you won't even get a chance to shoot at before they shoot at you.

So having 3 units of scouts will give you the ability to screen outside your deployment zone, and allow your guardsmen to at least block deepstrike charges on your vehicles. Points wise I think you are over allocated in killing vehicles/knights with ranged weapons.",1572566452

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Really happened to me and my old college roommate! We worked together at a corporate job, and I had gone to the rarely used bathroom on the upper floor to get some privacy. Right after I sit down I hear someone walk in and go to the stall on the far end. Then I hear nothing. Silence. I just waited thinking, I was here first so YOU have to leave. After a few minutes of tense silence,..and this was pre-phone days so it really was tense waiting for the other to admit defeat...the person gets up (YES!) leaves the stall and is washing their hands. Player 3 then enters the game (haha) and I hear her say,”Hey Christine!” and I say “Chris is that you?” She starts laughing and comes back into the stall next to mine. As soon as the girl leaves, we just die laughing. And wind up pooping next to each other and gossiping.  Because there is no shame when you’re with your college roommate-they’ve seen you at your absolute worst. 

We still bring it up and laugh, that was 18 years ago. Poop gate of 2001.",1572566453

That's not throwing anyone under the bus. That's literally explaining to everyone what our jobs are.

Or get a slide caliper and measure it yourself - or just do it with a normal ruler but with something that small it'll be hard to get an accurate measure.

Maintenance has actually been higher on heavy duty EVs vs ICE counterparts to-date (check out the 54-month NREL Foothill study).

By using renewable natural gas, emissions are lower than electric, and often negative with dairy renewable natural gas.

Sorry, but the physics and economics do not support most medium and heavy duty EV applications. Medium and heavy duty are very different than light duty. Kind of like a Cessna and a 737 - both planes, but what works on one does not necessarily work on the other.",1572566454

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","You may quickly come to the conclusion that saving the extra bytes of memory is an optimisation; generally this is true but in this case it's also a case of the _magic number_ rule, as you're using a type for a purpose that isn't immediately clear (to others, including those who wrote your machine-optimising compiler). Furthermore, since you can't have profiler guidance for this generalisation, it would be both a _premature_ optimisation and a _micro_-optimisation.

It's not even a _good_ optimisation, at that; I'd call it **more of a pessimism** due to the fact that this `char` value will in all likelihood end up in a register that still occupies the four bytes (or whatever; there is no requirement that an `int` occupy four bytes in C; that requirement is specific to your x86 environment)... or it won't, and in the case where it won't be put in a register you have bus alignment to contend with... for a start, how do you prevent bus alignment in the first place, when the compiler will attempt to automatically align your variable and/or `struct` members? Furthermore, assuming you can work out an answer to that question... what would you rather, waste three bytes, or go out of your way to circumvent compiler optimisations and unsuitably align your data? Finally, I'd hazard a guess that the machine code required to access the misaligned data wouldn't just require extra CPU clocks to execute, but would also occupy _more than three bytes_... **OOPS!**

The bottom line here is that you might want to consider writing code to be **clear and concise** (using `bool` from `&lt;stdbool.h&gt;` for a start), and **using your profiler to determine the most significant optimisation**; otherwise, you're wasting your time on the small fries, and potentially pushing the more significant optimisations out of the realm of possibility. You ought to know, some optimisations eliminate the possibility to make others happen. Perhaps one day you'll want to make those more significant optimisations happen, and in that case you'd need to find and selectively replace `char` with `bool` (because `char` is used for other things, right?)... in that case I would say, any minuscule _machine clock time_ benefit you happen to obtain from _saving three bytes_ is going to be dwarfed by your _human clock time_ spent reversing this premature micro-optimisation... right?",1572566454

Also, I am Canadian too, what gun control do we have over them?  1We have background checks they do too. 2 The FBI looks after the control of guns in the states and who is allowed to have them.
3 more handguns are used in shootings than rifles and machine guns...in yet the media tries to enrage people into banning them... Oddly enough.

Without sounding like a dick, do you even know what they are proposing in the states for gun control?

1 either a gun buyback which is a terrible idea for multiple reasons if you'd like to hear.

2 banning of rifles like AR15  when there are guns with higher calibres than that an AR15 isn't even a popular gun in most shootings.

3 for the spineless democrats they only say "" common-sense gun control"" without even mentioning what that would entail.  Beto (democrat) at least had the balls too at least not lie and said he is going to remove all guns. I don't like the guy but respect his honesty on it.

If you have Chegg, open it to a homework/practice problem you're working on, then try to do the problem on your own. As soon as you get stuck, look at the Chegg steps until you understand what to do. This may take several attempts until you can do a problem after only reading the few few steps, and then finally without any help.

If you don't have Chegg, try Slader; it's free.

Try the SQ3R method when you go through the textbook/notes:

S: Skim; skim the chapter, the headings, the summaries, etc. to get an idea of the scope of the material.

Q: Question; After skimming, write down specific questions you have about the material/concepts. The questions can be concrete (e.g. ""What is Gauss's Law?"") or more open-ended (e.g. ""what are some applications of semiconductors?"")
I find it time-consuming to write, so I use Quizlet flashcards (which also makes filling in the answer and later review much easier)

3R: Read, Review, Recite; Now actually read the chapter, looking for the answers to your questions as you go. You don't have to write the answers, but it might be a good idea (or, make flashcards like I do)

You can also write down any relevant formulas you find, but I'd suggest doing after you read, so you don't waste your time, and so you can focus on understanding the text instead of hunting for formulas.

You better believe I’m walking around those parameters saying, ‘I lift this up and I dedicate every ounce of this place as holy ground and I dedicate it by the superior blood of Jesus.’ And every door that God opens for me, I invoke the name of Jesus. I release angels right now and the Holy Spirit and walls of fire. I burn up every demonic altar in the name of Jesus and I call it to crumble and any assignment by any principality, power, darkness, and wickedness against this nation, against other nations, is coming down in the name of Jesus. Let it all fall down, let it crumble, by the fire of God, let it be burned right now. I erect the altar of God right now, I renounce every demonic spirit, I renounce every covenant made with Satan.”

Really?” White continued. “Lyndon Johnson sent 100,000 social workers out, looked for every black pregnant woman, created a system called welfare and drove the male out of the household and said, ‘We’re going to destroy the black community because we’re going to destroy the family.'”

On the other hand, for example, some people have been seriously abused, even if only by themselves, and come here with a mind/body in a state of extreme atrophy/damage.

What a hard-working person might consider ""just barely doing anything, actually that probably doesn't even count"" might seem like a huge burden to the atrophied person.

"LegionFX","t5_3e713","It's when a character has achieved true inner peace and surrounded themselves with ""blue"" thoughts/feelings. Blue often shows up when characters are relaxed, at peace, and slightly detached. It also shows up when characters are in control of the situation. We see it after having sex, or taking drugs, or when David exorcises the shadow king. We see it when Lenny tempts Squirrel as the mad hatter (Interestingly she also has a lot of purple! A fusion, Mania, perhaps?) Blue contrasts with Red - anger, confusion, chaos, mental illness. 

When the characters say ""Why is it blue"" I think they have hit nirvanna. They have rid themselves of all the ""red"" thoughts, weather through heavy drug use or more literally by bleeding to death and pouring their ""red"" on the floor. The characters have reached inner peace in these moments, even if temporarily and they are bathed in blue. ""Why is it blue?"" is all they can say to describe such a  transcendent experience. 

""It's always blue"" is what B/Lenny says when she doesn't understand the question. When David says it he is acknowledging that Lenny is at peace with her decision and in that is as close as he'll ever get to saying he's sorry for neglecting her.",1572566458

"AmazonFlexDrivers","t5_3fb78","That's not how it works. The government deducts $0.58/mile as a baseline standard ""cost"" and won't tax you on it. It's similar to standard deduction of $12,500 or whatever its up to now. That $0.58 is a Standard Business deduction. 

If this year you made $40,000 from flex, the federal government will tax you on $40,000 - Standard Deduction of $12,500 = $27,500 of taxable income.

You can add that mileage against that $27,500. Aka if you drove 10,000 miles, you'll get 10,000 x 0.58 = $5,800 off as a business expense. 

So $27,500 - $5,800 = $21,700 in taxable income on your $40,000 earned. 

Aka the government can only tax you for $21,700 instead of $40,000.

Tax rate generally is like 13%, so you would owe $2,821 instead of $5,200.

You 'actual' cost is your gas mileage, which unless your wasting fuel at greater than $0.58/mile, you're not losing money. You need to be at like 5 mpg to truly lose money, which if you are you've got bigger problems lol",1572566459

*****
&gt; A month later, on February 7, Giuliani walked into a San Francisco Apple Store with a problem: his iPhone had gotten locked down after 10 unsuccessful passcode attempts, NBC reports.

&gt; Some security experts criticized Giuliani&amp;#039;s decision to seek help at an Apple Store for his problem.

&gt; &amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s no way he should be going to a commercial location to ask for that assistance,&amp;quot; former FBI agent E.J. Hilbert told NBC. Hilbert argued there was too much risk that an Apple Store employee would gain access to sensitive information on Giuliani&amp;#039;s phone.

"anime","t5_2qh22","No.

I'll grant that anime's always been prone to excessive reliance on tropes/cliches, but the isekai genre has been especially bad.

And sure, there's other genres of anime that are way worse, but they're usually genres I already considered irredeemable anyways

Whereas SF/fantasy is my favorite genre, and with low effort isekais chewing up so much of that space, it feels like there's been a real drought of decent anime in my favorite genres. It's even more irritating because I actually like isekai _conceptually_, and think it offers a lot of room for aspiring writers to explore ideas. It's just... so much of it is plain bad.

But if it didn't happen in the game it didn't happen at all. I'd rather not consider anything in Zestiria anime as cannon after how they handled the Eizen, Edna, Zaveid storyline. They took pandering to the fans to a whole new level. Pertaining to Alisha and Rose, Zestiria should've just simply ended with Rose doing Rose stuff and Alisha actually filling that princess role. Natalia from Abyss is a million times better at the whole Fighter/Princess/For my people character. I most likely wouldn't be interested in any wholesome gay related plot line to be honest, especially in a tales game where the objective always ends up in we gotta save the world. It's more of a girl thing to like that stuff, more fitting for the Atelier series. But I liked the funny occasional Ristelle moments from Vesperia.",1572566466

"Animemes","t5_2w6fe","As you’ve [probably noticed](https://i.imgur.com/qjyrAXY.png), our beloved mascots have been under a lot of stress lately. To relieve some of that stress, they’ve requested that we do something for them. ^(Wait, you two. Are you sure this will go over well? Whoa! Fine, I get it. Just put the hammers down, ok?)

Anyway, they’ve asked us to kindly ban all reposts for the next month. As this is for the sake of their well-being ~~and the mod team’s~~, we have no choice but to oblige. So as of right now, No Repost November has officially begun.

So what does this mean? According to our mascots, this is what our repost rule should look like this month:

**Rule 9: Reposts**

-No reposts of memes previously submitted to r/Animemes. 

-Minor edits to posts (see rule 2.1) still count as reposts.

-No chain posts.

-Deleting and resubmitting your own content still counts as reposting and will be removed.
___
We've normally allowed most memes to be reposted, as long as it’s been at least 3 months since they were last legally posted. So the main change is that that **will not** be case throughout this month. 

Simple enough, right? All other rules will be unchanged by this event.

To those of you who frequently submit old memes as part of your participation here and may be worried about refraining from that while *also* going through No Nut November,  well... we’ll have to ask that you endure it. ^(Please, we don’t want anybody to get hurt.)

At the end of the month, maybe we'll know whether this idea born of our mascots' insani- I mean, ingenuity turns out to have merit. 

Happy November, everybody! 

And remember: No Reposts.
___

Also, I'd like to thank u/SrGrafo for the incredible mascot art we've shown you all on our banners and subreddit icons over the past month. Our monthlong October event would not have been possible without his help.
___

**UPDATE**: Too many people are already failing, and our mascots have *persuaded* us to take this event a bit more seriously. So as of now:
#Posting a repost during November will always earn you at least a **3-day temporary ban.**",1572566467

"TeenMomOGandTeenMom2","t5_3nsi0","Jenelle was out drinking, dancing and partying this weekend and yet David did nothing. *It’s been days*.

This man has no self control. Ever. He is volatile. He killed a family pet. 

During the CPS case (while trying to be on”good behavior”) he literally cursed out the CPS workers. He also flew off the handle, got in a fight with the social worker and proceeded to get kicked out their supervised CPS visitation. 

He has threatened the police. He has threatened the Secret Service.

I truly do not think David is physically capable of holding it together if this was real. I’ll eat my words if there’s a new 911 call or some other major major outburst. As of now I’ve only seen sappy, whiny, or welding posts.

Clearly turning on/off a timer and whatever 'player' is. Reasonable guess would be music/video player since it talks about volume and duration.

Nebraska does use Fentanyl as part of a 4-drug protocol, but I'd bet a bunch of money that they order theirs from legitimate manufacturers rather than using seized drugs.

Interestingly, Mississippi and Oklahoma allow for Nitrogen hypoxia and firing squads if lethal injection drugs aren't available, which they haven't been recently. Utah also allows for firing squads, and you can opt for a firing squad if you were sentenced before May 3, 2004.

"IncelsWithoutHate","t5_3jxsz","I agree with everything you said. Your point here is a very insightful and valid observation

""It's normal to say mean things when you're frustrated that you don't really mean.

Women  (and children) say these things all the time but people understand  they're saying it in anger and focus on what pain brought them to say  this rather than nitpicking on what was actually said. When a man does  the same thing, we focus on what he said and takes any threatening words  very seriously.""

This difference in the way men and women are treated is a double standard and hypocritical. Men are held far more accountable for their words than women are. Men are treated with far far less sympathy and compassion than women are.

How can people claim to be in favor of gender equality when they treat men and women so differently? It's a big lie but it's taken so much for granted in our society that I think hardly anyone even notices what you pointed out.

However I can also sympathize with women if they feel intimidated by a man when he expresses negative feelings/gets angry and she is with this man face to face in person. I can understand why a woman would feel intimidated and very uncomfortable in this situation.

I completely understand why it's taken more seriously when men get angry versus when women get angry, I'd be a hypocrite if I pretended otherwise because in my apartment complex I hear women yelling at their spouse once in a while and I never take it seriously. I always just laugh and think it is funny. However if I were to hear a man yelling at his spouse I know I'd have a very different reaction, I'd be worried about if the situation will escalate into violence.

Is that fair to men? Maybe not, but as you pointed out you can't deny the reality that men are physically stronger. It's just an unfortunate fact of life.

However the problem is that men are shamed even when they are a threat to no one. When men express their negative emotions online they are a threat to no one (unless they are threatening violence online, which is entirely different) they are still shamed for it anyways.

Isn't there some subreddit called /r/inceltears that is dedicated to shaming men for expressing negative feelings? This is exactly what I'm talking about. Men are being shamed in a context when they are a threat to nobody and are doing nothing but harmlessly expressing negative feelings they have about their life. This wouldn't be met with shame in a healthy society, it would be met with compassion. Are there similar threads aimed at shaming women merely for expressing negative emotions online? I doubt that, but if there are they are equally deplorable.",1572566471

I know I tend to lose out of manascrew on a losing streak more than half the time, and when I compare my Arena experience to my tabletop experience, that seems more than usual. If the rest of the game handles randomization the way it handles its shuffler, it's my opinion that an algorithm simulates the ""luck curve"" and it just does a bad job. I don't think there's a targeted system that is designed to slow progress. With Oko being a thing, speed is of the essence and combo decks have less success than straight aggro.  On ""legit"" losses, I am out of the game by turn 4 most times.

The only explicit power the House has is to impeach.  Now,obviously, they have to have some sort of process before they impeach.

At the same time, having a vote does lend legitimacy to the probe.  A member of the house is relatively low ranking compared to a President or Senator.  However, a good chunk of the house has weight behind it, which is why you finally have Republicans taking notice.

Trump still has no requirement to comply with any of their procedure, but this is a shot across the bow that basically says if he doesn't cooperate they can actually impeach him.

So I would expect some more cooperation from the White House after this.

For for those who don't understand the procedure:

Impeachment would be equivalent to charging someone with a crime",1572566471

There's a lot of stuff out there that challenges the ""ideal of progress"" for the West, so I'm not sure how useful it is to make a judgement about what is ""good"" and what is ""bad"" in terms of ""education"". 

However, I can think of several reasons why the Charter of the World of Education is a threat, which is why many governments are willing to get involved. 

The obvious one is the Charter puts a global framework for education at odds with the US Constitution, which the US Constitution is based on. 

The US Constitution basically said schools should be state-run and governed by state-level legislators, and the Charter of the World of Education is a way to give the charter to the ""government of the United States""",1572566472

I found out last year that my wife had an affair after 6 years of marriage. Worst part is that we had just moved to a new city for her career and spent all of our savings to do it. Things were rough, but I honestly thought we were getting through a rough patch. Did I ever think I’d find out what I did when she got back from her business trip a week after we moved? Absolutely not. I contacted his wife and told her and it was one the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. Ultimately, I found out a lot more information as her and I talked through it and started finding the lies in their separate stories. We’re 18 months out from D-Day and there are still days that I feel like things can’t be repaired. I wish I could say it gets easier, but I haven’t gotten to a point where I feel like it is. Every time I feel like I’ve worked through something there’s another hurdle. I’m having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that regardless of what route I choose I’ll always be the one paying the price for her decision. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.

I guess the only words of comfort I really have for you is that you’re not alone in trying to work through it. Everywhere you look people will talk about how they’d never give a cheater another chance, but things change when you’re in that position. You’re showing how much stronger you are than him by giving it a chance. If the day comes where you realize that you definitely can’t live with what he did then don’t hesitate to call it quits.

And I think the honest answer is simply that it is still socially acceptable to ignore Native Americans and the history of suffering that is attached to them. I’m not sure why that is, but in the current social climate, you hear a lot about how the slave trade and subsequent treatment of African Americans has had a lasting effect on those communities, but there is very little discussion of the United States’ genocide and cultural eradication of the various Native tribes beyond bullet points in a history class.

The phones between brackets are the ones I sold within a few weeks. Most of these phones contained either software or bloatware I personally couldn't handle and fix with the help of custom ROMs.

**Worst phone:** iPhone 6 - I just couldn't handle iOS after years of custom ROMs on Android. 

**Best Phone**: Nexus 5 - gave me a way into the custom ROM world and made me use custom ROMs on all my phones, even today. The software smoothness was on another level and way ahead of its competitors at the time, every other phone felt laggy and sluggish back then when comparing it side-by-side. I have repaired the screen over three times, replaced the battery two times. I simply refused to get rid of this phone and tried to extend its lifetime as much as possible. The phone had a terrible battery life, camera and build quality, but will always be my favorite phone.

**Honorable mention:** Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 - I bought this phone as temporarily phone in the first place, because of its cheap price. However this phone surprised me that much that I kept using it as daily driver for almost 2 years.",1572566474

"swtor","t5_2qxih","&gt;While I appreciate the sentiment, you gotta keep in mind that Kira survived regardless of the Knight becoming the Alliance Commander.

There are other motivations in different storylines, for sure, but in the Knight canon that is how she survived... and I mean let's be honest here, KOTET and KOTFE was written specifically for Force Users but is really specifically meant or at least played best as the Knight. The established history with Valkie and everything else... I mean when I played as my Inquisitor, I felt like the story was just a rail shooter and all my evil choices were just out of place or did hardly anything to change the story... except when I killed someone.

But this is just going to turn into more KOTET/KOTFE bashing. There is a much better way they could have explained the other classes playing the story and established a canon that has one specific class and then allow the other classes to go back to their element. But I digress.

&gt; I don't think she'll ever break her commitment to the Jedi. 

Definitely. But she wouldn't be the goodie two shoes she was by the end of the Knight story. If anything she would have become more gray because of circumstance, but would still very much have control over the darkness and never again the other way around. But that doesn't make her a bad Jedi. Being extreme light can also be a path to the dark side... 

&gt; OK, so even a Sith Warrior can get Kira, so why can't my Knight also have Nadia? 

Fucking seriously... but I guess it's for the best that I couldn't...

&gt;  One of my major gripes with the game ever since KOTET has been that the majority of returning companions had no real role to play going forward.  

This will be a gripe of mine until the end of time unless they find a way to bring some of the popular comps into the main story...

But yeah we'll see how the rest of the content develops going forward.",1572566476

there’s a reason your eyes have to go up to actually read the furigana. without doing that you won’t be able to tell if that’s a さ or a き in your periphery, an あ or an お, a ぱ or a ば.

"VolvoRWD","t5_2qk38","If you aren’t hearing the fuel pump hum when jumping the main fuel pump fuse to the in tank pump fuse then the problem lies in the wiring. 

I had this issue recently on my 89 and fixed it all up myself :).

The main issue for me was the connection on my actual main fuel pump, the wires had corrodes and snapped and made a very poor connection, but still good enough to run sometimes. Eventually, I fixed it by swapping the main fuel pump and in tank pump. 

Here’s where the wiring is: from the fuel pump relay, you should have a large red wire and a large yellow AND red wire. I suggest using a probe or multimeter and checking for power at the red wire with the key in the on-II position. If you don’t have power, check the main 30amp fuse coming off the battery, this can blow and the engine will still crank, very strange culprit to find. If you do have power, try jumping the yellow and red with the solid red. If this triggers the fuel pumps on, your problem isn’t in the ECU and only confirms it’s the wiring and not any sensors etc. You might have bad hall or engine speed sensor if no power to the red, it will make it not ground the wire coming from the ECU, something to check for too.  Furthermore, check for power under the floorboard or trunk where the fuel pump wires run with a multimeter, this will establish if you have a wire break between the relay or not. What I tried was running a cable (jumpers work) from the relay all the way back to the wires at the fuse pump to see if you can get it to run. 

Unfortunately, there is so much to go wrong. And it will take a while to fix yourself. One last suggestion is just dropping the whole fuel tray off the bottom left tire and checking the connections and hooking it up to 12 v to see if it will run. if you have any more questions just drop a comment and I’ll answer :)",1572566480

&gt; Firtash initially claimed he was indicted because Washington wanted to prevent him from influencing Ukrainian politics during the country&amp;#039;s fragile transition after a 2014 revolution deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, whose government Firtash had supported.

&gt; Firtash&amp;#039;s lawyers in Austria have also filed sealed court papers that criticize the Justice Department in line with theories promoted by Trump suggesting that investigators were improperly motivated by politics, according to people familiar with the arguments.

&gt; The bribery case against Firtash appears to be strong, former prosecutors noted, and the surest way to avoid prison time would be to convince Trump and the Justice Department to drop extradition.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Hope it's useful :). I only just now see you also added ""fortified city"".

Fortified cities are a somewhat different matter from castles, most medieval cities were surprisingly small, nothing like what we call cities these days. Most were just densely populated villages in terms of size and population really, about 10 000 people or so? But there were large cities, and some of them were walled. Jerusalem is a good example I believe. Generally large cities that have a regular or looming thread will develop walls. Taking Jerusalem again, obviously during the Crusades and Struggles of the day, Jerusalem was a city at constant risk of being taken, and large cities are important cities, both because they became large because of their importance, but also because the large amount of people, means large amount of benefit, power, and economic gains from holding one.

But, large cities, to wall them, is also very expensive, and cities keep growing, so a city might get walled numerous times, if enough people settle outside of a wall for that section to be important enough for the massive costs of building walls, then another wall will pop up, leading to large, multi-layered defensive complexes.

Another way that walled cities can become large, is if you have two separate, but close by cities, which sort of merge. This is relatively rare, as cities don't grow big near each other, unless they started out as two towns on either side of a river, and eventually they might build bridges across, and effectively become a single city.",1572566482
"MtvChallenge","t5_32dph","I do not understand why you were downvoted on this at all.  It's an undeniable fact of the Challenge that many of the consistently excellent daily performers of a season don't win the final. Many finals are decided by puzzles but you don't see Jordan acknowledging that Tori is not good at puzzles or trivia which he's seen for himself. 
Last season Wes had more daily wins than Turbo but lost to him in the final. Cara had amazing daily performances as well. Zach is basically the poster child of this issue with Vendettas and has always been a beast in dailies but less so in eliminations and finals. It really depends on the composition of the final and they all have no idea what's going to be in it. So someone says finals in Thailand have had more swimming... That does not mean anything. They are also assuming a potential purge or even breaking into individual which changes whether there's a point to eliminating weak players.  Jordan does have the ability to watch seasons he's not on and assess the difficulty of what they're doing. It's what this entire Reddit it based on for fucks sake.",1572566482

2. If you are running a reverse proxy, you port forward everything to the proxy's :443 port and let the proxy handle the redirection to whatever port on the same IP. Example - Proxy a.test.com redirects to 192.168.1.2:900 and b.test.com redirects to 192.168.1.2:901 etc?

The fact that people *still* think Contrapoints isn't a consistent stream of bad takes on non-binary people (""oh it was just the one time"" people say when it was more than just the one time) is also an indication of how easily people forgive and forget just because someone is famous.  And like you said, it's 100% not about ""canceling"" her (I don't give a shit about ""canceling"" her, anyway) but about holding her and people like her accountable when they fuck up wielding the influence they have.

"Steam","t5_2qwis","Absolutely stunning update. Got caught off guard did not expect such masterpiece to happen to steam library. Feels way more modern, way easier to use and way more beautiful. All the information about updates located right at the top in a simple, minimalist way. The left side does just what the old version did in a better way and with game icons and small green icons showing that friends are playing the game. The right side shows game tiles and clicking on them provides immediate information on absolutely everything, with a faster and easier access. Community hub being so easily accessible now makes it so much better, I usually rarely went there because I constantly kept forgetting about its existence, but whenever I did, it was lots of fun to see what other players are sharing. Now its going to be part of the routine.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh but you have to ""scroll down to find your game"". Lame excuse for those who never bothered to actually learn how to use Steam. Simply tap the first letters of the game on your keyboard and the game will automatically be found for you. Either you really didn't know, or you're desperately looking for excuses to please your disappointed emotions by bashing the update.

Old library was growing old, and it was noticeable with time. Modernization and changes cannot be stopped as we must move forward. Better PCs must be acquired to run improved technology, and steam updates must be done to keep up with the flow.

And yes, the more time you invest in learning how to use the new interface, the better your experience will be. If you refuse to learn because its ""too long"" and your time is too ""precious"", youll be having the same troubles as if you moved to another country without learning the language.

Just like the flip phones, windows XP and trackball mouses had to go away, so is the old steam library.",1572566482

Taoism holds compassion dear, but never uses ""Always"" or ""Never."" The same with frugality and humility. They are good strategies for having a happy life, but they should never encompass ""always"" or ""never."" Blind faith in a path will not serve you. Taoism doesn't have rules, only suggestions.  


To use a quote from Buddha, ""Don't mistake a finger for the moon."" The end goal of Taoism is a happy and long life, and that generally means treating others well, respecting the resources you have, and not being seduced by your ego into thinking you are more important than you actually are.

"morbidquestions","t5_37wph","Not only are there absolutely statistics on suicide, they clearly indicate that roughly [70% of people who attempt and survive never go on to try again. ](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/#Owens) 
Only 23% ever try again and survive. About 7% survive try again and successfully kill themselves. 

That’s only 7 out of 100 that actually succeed after trying once. So 93 out 100 try it once and regret it.

Further, the vast majority of successful suicides are on the first try. This, combined with 70% of people who survive never trying again, paints a pretty clear picture. 

People treat suicide like it’s a stance; that it is someone’s absolute right. If someone is dying anyway, or living in an incredible amount of pain, I can sympathize. So will the friends and family who see that pain and suffering. Its incredibly common when people die naturally from painful diseases that it is a blessing, and that their suffering is over. This is a natural part of grieving, when people justify the death as being better than life. People can let go. 


When someone who is physically healthy kills themselves, that ability to cope is destroyed. Death is not peaceful.  No matter what way you choose to do it, SOMEONE has to reckon with that decision. It could be your family mopping up your blood, a paramedic pulling your body out of the water, it could be anyone but it’s gonna be someone. Asking someone to be ok with their cancer-ridden child choosing to end their life is difficult, but manageable. When that discussion never happened, and someone you cared about is just gone, it is internalized as trauma for the rest of their life. It is not selfish to hope that doesn’t happen. 

&gt; It's none of their business. As far as they are concerned I am out of their life regardless of which option I chose. Tell someone to stay alive for the sake of others is far more selfish than suicide.

You either need better friends or need to be one to yourself, because that’s not how normal people act when the people they’re close to move away. Unless you expressly say, “I don’t care about our relationship; go fuck yourself and goodbye” people hope the ones they were close to are doing well, even if they never speak again.",1572566483

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Twitter is saying that, if you've already made it, you deserve to be unchallenged

By advertising, yes, essentially that is what they're saying.  Dorsey's statement can even be interpreted that way - his references to ""earned"" reach.

&gt;corporations

While I see your point and agree that there's a hell of a mess between politics and corporations in this warped system we live in, I don't think it's sensible say ""they paid for ads for products and then used profits from that product to buy political influence"" is anywhere akin to ""Senator Schmoe here, elect me cuz my opponent is the literal devil.""  Yes, everything is interconnected, but with the reach of some of the biggest megacorps, you pretty much can't buy anything without paying them something.  At some point you have to decide whether to spend the extra hours scouring for alternatives and making the money to afford them, or try to promote awareness of the problem and support politicians who will combat it.

The final point about who decides what is and isn't...yeah, that's been raised by almost everyone and I agree every time.  Your point about Twitter's track record with bans and appeals highlights why this is actually a problem as well.  While I'm not sure how the ban would play with ads (are ads screened in any way before they go live, or are they reported like everything else?  Would accounts get penalized for running ads against this ban?  I really don't know).

If a politician makes an ad that's intended to promote their candidacy but shrouds it in ""non-political"" issues or tries to disguise it as an issue ad, that should be punished.  But there's no real way to know whether that intent was there or not.  So that's also problematic.

I'll give Twitter the benefit of the doubt for now on how they'll structure and execute this policy.

All in all, while the ban is a good idea, I agree that there are enough problems with implementation that it may actually cause more confusion and frustration for everyone, and that said implementation could wind up slanting discourse further rather than improving it.  So !delta",1572566484

*****
&gt; Firtash initially claimed he was indicted because Washington wanted to prevent him from influencing Ukrainian politics during the country&amp;#039;s fragile transition after a 2014 revolution deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, whose government Firtash had supported.

&gt; Firtash&amp;#039;s lawyers in Austria have also filed sealed court papers that criticize the Justice Department in line with theories promoted by Trump suggesting that investigators were improperly motivated by politics, according to people familiar with the arguments.

&gt; The bribery case against Firtash appears to be strong, former prosecutors noted, and the surest way to avoid prison time would be to convince Trump and the Justice Department to drop extradition.

Please re-read your own words.

Some questions:
1) Are you okay he loves another woman?  Is that acceptable to you? Is it ok for him to kiss another woman?
2) He says he is willing to stay with you, are you willing to keep him? Are you willing to let him treat you as a consolation prize?
3) Where are you in this marriage?  What do you want? Where is your voice?
4) Are you okay for him to keep in contact and have that temptation?
5) You know, he cannot be trusted, and despite being caught before they continued their affair - what makes you think, just because you now know, they wont carry on?
6) He is willing to confess to only kissing?  How many relationships only go that far?  Do you think that both of them would risk their marriages for only kissing?

I know this sounds very harsh, but you need to seriously consider these points to decide whether he is genuine about wanting to save your marriage.  If he is not willing to give up all contact avenues, he isn’t really committed, and the fact you wont force the issue summarizes what a lovely trusting person you are.  Without setting some boundaries and expectations and working on what is wrong in your marriage which prompted his attention to be diverted, things wont get any better, and actually you will eventually become compliant with his cheating ways.  Marriage counselling would seriously help manage this, if he is genuine.

Please be cautious though, cheaters will tell you anything to get you back on side, before reverting back to their ways, and they have already proved that when they were caught before.  So, trust your gut, if in your gut it doesn’t feel right, trust it!  Beware of empty promises too, if you find he doesn’t fulfill them, its just lip service to keep you sweet it will be because you are the provider of his creature comforts, washing, cleaning, nice home, childcare, extra wages etc, and he will be getting his excitement and fun elsewhere.  Make sure you are in a marriage and not a domestic service provider.",1572566487

since this would be generally useful &amp; helpful if not perfectly precise

The protoss and the zerg felt less and less like their respective races as the patches went on. I'd have rather seen the roach have their stats nerfed to keep them at 1 control and the stalker take 3 psi instead of taking the nerfs in stats.

They'd end up doing the same to Warcraft 4 under their current mindset, especially if they build off the trainwreck that Warcraft lore has become under WoW's tenure. Warcraft 4 would need to be a soft reboot, picking up from after Warcraft 3 in both story and lore. The Draenai introduced as they were in WoW?

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","I'm on my second MA. I'm a mature student, ten to twenty years older than most of my cohort both now and during my first degree. I'm also married with a young son.

First time around, I found it hard to connect with my fellow students as while they they were doing all the partying and socializing associated with (youthful) student life I had family commitments and paid work to support my family. Before entering academia I partied hard during my twenties an early thirties, I got all that out of my system and apart from a few times a year, I'm not currently on mission to get totally wrecked all the time, nor network and socialize in that way.

This time around is even trickier as my current university is in another city 120 km from where I live and I commute two or three times a week to attend. At the end of classes, the last thing I want to do is hang out, go partying, etc., I just want to get home and chill with my fam, and my actual friends as well.

However, while on both occasions I've missed out on many of the everyday socializing aspects of university life, despite not being part of the party crowd and department events (especially those that take place on the days when I'm not on campus/in town), I have still managed to establish solid and productive relationships simply based on the time spent with classmates, colleagues, and faculty while I am actually around. 

Precious and constructive engagements have emerged despite the age gaps between them and I (apart from faculty, we kind of end up being from the same generation) and, at the moment, the lack of geographical proximity as well. I have built up departmental working arrangements and have been hired for paid work as a research assistant for my department and another research institute that I can do from home based on their perception and appreciation for my knowledge of the subject and particular abilities that are compatible for their needs. And when I go to class, there doesn't really feel like there is any real dramatic distance between me and everybody else, the only thing is, I just don't go out and get trashed with them all after class.

That is not to say, that at many points during both degrees, that I never felt like I was outside of the loop and I did in fact feel a sense of distance between my cohorts and myself and that was at times hard to deal with.

Overall, however, it hasn't been a major problem, just something I think and have thought about sometimes. On a professional level, it hasn't affected me too much.",1572566489

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;You are the only one making the claim that this is the case, which I assume is against that of experts in the field.

That assumption is not an argument. If you can simply say “I assume you’re making that up” then it just means you have nothing to say on the subject and would have been better off remaining silent. 


&gt; Do you have sources of biologists stating this is the case?  I think this idea is solely your own without proper backing.  (Cue vague appeals to ""my education"")

My appeals to my education are never vague. I was educated at California State University East Bay; got my BA in Philosophy and my Masters in Educational Psychology. The California state standards require advanced science classes and the Philosophy degree requires a rigorous study of the history of science as epistemology and the Masters program requires several classes in research. 

That doesn’t make me qualified in anything except Philosophy and Educational Psychology but I know enough about science to know what’s BS and what’s not. The claim that morality is based in biology is without merit and you have no rational justification to allow it but you leave it unchallenged and is proof of a double standard. 


&gt; Do you have sources of biologists stating this is the case? 
[I can Google and read](https://m.phys.org/news/2011-08-fast-evolutionary-million-years.html) but you’re not objecting on any rational basis but just skepticism for skepticism’s sake. If I said I had eggs for breakfast you’d demand a source. 

&gt; Edit: However this link will probably do a better job than myself (a non-expert) in explaining what you are missing:


It’s certainly better but in reading the introduction it does not say “we have good reason to replace ethics with biology” but rather “if we replaced ethics with biology it would be significant”

The best summary of this work is this quote :

&gt; Is this human capacity a biological adaptation, having perhaps conferred a selective advantage on our hominin ancestors by enhancing social cohesion and cooperation? ...If so, then it would be part of evolved human nature to employ moral judgment in governing human behavior, rather than a mere “cultural veneer” artificially imposed on an amoral human nature. 

Or in other words (albeit crudely) “is it all biology, if so then it’s not social!” I mean yeah **IF** it’s biology then it’s not anything else.",1572566491

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;A while back at a funeral someone mentioned that we as Christians should ""Love people more than we love being right"". 


I agree with it too. Don't hyper focus on all of the rules, instead just share the love of God amongst as many people as possible. If you truly think someone is lead astray, provide simple nudges in the right direction, instead of ranting about how they're a damned sinner who deserves to rot in hell. 


If that person asks you to stop, then stop. It's as simple as that. Constantly demanding that you're right and they're wrong will only drive people away from God, just like it drove me away from him 


The simple, but not easy, solution to this problem is to LISTEN to others. Take the time to process their words and the meanings behind it. 


Pretend that they're right for the moment and ask yourself if you might be wrong. Try and find cracks in your own argument. 


A lot of people lack this skill. People who have a lot of faith seem to be more arrogant in their knowledge compared to others. I'm not 100% sure on that, but I do know that there are A LOT of examples within the Christian community",1572566492

"firefox","t5_2qh4p","&gt; The add-ons just need to be validated and signed.

In order to be signed add-ons have to be uploaded to Mozilla though (unless that's changed recently). Until now distros like Debian haven't needed to upload their extensions to Mozilla which might not even be possible (do their package builders have network access?). For now at least Firefox has a configure flag to disable signing but that won't matter if Mozilla is going to remove sideloading altogether so when you `apt install webext-ublock-origin` Firefox no longer recognises any extensions.

This is tough because on the one hand I recognise what Mozilla is trying to do (prevent the auto-installation of extensions by malicious software) but on the other hand if malicious software has admin/root access nothing Mozilla is doing will help one bit (the software can no longer install a browser extension but since it has full access to your machine it could do pretty much anything it wants anyway).",1572566493

"Metal","t5_2qhud","Death metal lyrics are often quite bodily, and our lyrics are a case in point. They often address bodily experiences (eg. shit, tears, eroticism, blood, emotion, dissociation, etc.). Bodies disturb, and the thinkers I'm drawn to try to understand that disturbance, which is why our more 'intellectual' approach to death metal actually makes a lot of sense, at least to me. I also think a lot of death metal bands are very conceptual in their lyrics and artwork, even if they don't have more or less fully articulated philosophies behind what they produce.

The free writing is always a risk. I definitely think it might lead to an impasse or to some kind of revelation, which is why it's the only way I want to write. Creativity has to involve the risk of whatever I think I know, or else I'm not truly being summoned by a creativity born of my unconscious.",1572566493

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","Please don’t, I know it’s cliche to say that but seriously I probably feel suicidal multiple times a week and I get over it. I don’t stop feeling sad but I lose the sense of total hopelessness generally after I sleep. 

A big problem for me was staying cooped up in my apartment for days at a time without ever going outside, to the point where I literally had anxiety about breaking some streak of not leaving for x-amount of days. I think it would be helpful to just go for a walk around campus with no intentional destination if nothing else but to give you a change of scenery.

And this is probably the most difficult part, no it is the most difficult part, but talking to people especially a counselor about anything. Talking helps me a TON and I love my alone time, to a fault really. Be proud of yourself though because it took some initiative to post on here and seek out some sort of conversation on here!

If you ever want to talk feel free to message me, I’m in college as well, been here for too long but I can relate to the college social struggles. But seriously I’m open, I might be a little slow to respond so please don’t take it personally if I seem to take a while 👍🙂",1572566493

The aid included night vision goggles and weapons used in border security.

So this aid was supposedly ""crucial"" but is now being withheld. I wonder why that is oh wait

&gt;One U.S. official told Reuters he believed the security assistance was necessary for Lebanon, as it struggles with instability not just within its own government but in a turbulent region and houses thousands of refugees from war in neighboring Syria.

&gt;The official said it was especially important to strengthen Lebanon’s military, which he deemed one of the most capable institutions in the country now, largely because of support from Washington.

&gt;**The official said drawing aid away from Lebanon could pave the way for Russia to move in.** Russia has expanded its influence in Syria since Trump announced he was withdrawing U.S. forces from the northeastern part of the country.

B2) **Do not delete this submission** (or ANY submission past or present), for any reason, or any of your comments as it will result in a ban.  If your request is fulfilled or you **no longer need the money** please do one or a combination of A) edit your post to reflect the change, B) flair your post as 'complete' (the flair button is under the body text of the post), and/or C) make a comment that it's no longer needed.

B3) **Wait 24 hours** from this post to make another unless this post or the next is prearranged with a particular lender

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. B) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately C) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

B6) **If you have any questions or concerns whatsoever**, feel free to ask moderators by clicking **[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fborrow)**

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if dankT3 has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=dankT3&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L4) Check dankT3's [**Spam History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), [**RedditMetis profile**](https://www.redditmetis.com/user/dankT3), or [**Atomiks Analyzer Profile**](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#dankT3), or [Redetective profile](https://www.redective.com/) [**!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gcdeletes+gcremoves+gcmirror+gcarchive+gcalerts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

L7) **For your convenience**, upon conclusion of this loan you can follow these links for prefilled posts regarding this loan - [PAID](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=%5BPAID%5D%20%28/u/dankT3%29%20-%20%28Amount%29%20%28Early/On%20Time/Late%29&amp;message=$paid%20/u/dankT3), [LATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=%5BLATE%5D%20%28/u/dankT3%29%20-%20%28Amount%29%20%28Days%20Late%29), [UNPAID](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/submit?selftext=true&amp;title=%5BUNPAID%5D%20%28/u/dankT3%29%20%28%23City,%20State,%20Country%20of%20borrower%29%20-%20%28$Amount%29,%20%28Days%20Late%29&amp;message=$paid%20/u/dankT3)

Title: **I'm a college student that signed a lease with 4 other guys and one of their mom's cosigned...**

Original Post: 

&gt; Back in July four of my fraternity brother's and I (one guy's mom cosigned) signed a 12 month lease to live in a off campus house for the school year. After a month sh\*t hit the fan and long story short I was not able to live in the house or pay rent anymore. After a couple months of not being able to find a replacement to sublease, they are attempting to pursue legal action against me after sending a letter to my parents asking for payment. Am I screwed? What am I supposed to do? Does the cosign affect anything legally? All of my income goes to my tuition.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I never want to be sexually harassed ever again

When I was in the eighth grade I went to a private middle school. Boys had to wear pants and girls had to wear skirts typical dress code. There was this one kid in my class, lets call him Al, he was the weird kid. He was very talkative and super annoying and so of course everyone hated him. But everyone thought they loved them and had continued in his ways of being annoying and disrespectful to every student, teacher, and principal. He had a sweet spot for me though. He liked me and had built a small relationship inside his head about us two. Now, me being a 13 year old girl and having body issues with myself, thought it was pretty weird of him having a crush on me. When he had heard about me saying about how disgusting it was, I guess he didn't take the sign about leaving me alone. 

Flash forward a couple months later this is where things took a turn for the worse. Students council was in full swing and my friends had all decided to join. Thursday (which are the days they would meet up) they had gone for their meetings and left me alone. I was walking through the halls when I feel someone behind me. I wanted to ask what the person wanted but they end up lifting up my skirt and putting a hand under. I turn to look who it was and it was Al. I stood there frozen and not knowing what to do. I end up running to the bathroom and started crying. But who could I have told? No one would have believed me anyways. This keeps happening on a weekly basis. Everytime my friends would leave, out came Al. I had never told anyone not even the teachers so I had just kept it to myself until I had graduated and started my freshman year of highschool which is this year. I just told my best friend about it and I started crying. She told me it wan't my fault. It still feels like it. It still is.",1572566496

Your boyfriend probably doesn’t follow fashion so closely and i understand he wants to appear more polished and refined to the other lawyers, but saying you embarrassed him is a bit over exaggerated.

*****
&gt; After just over a decade as Speaker and an estimated 14,000 throaty cries of &amp;quot;Order!&amp;quot;, it was perhaps typical of John Bercow that his final day in the Commons featured not only lengthy tributes but a brutal row with an MP conducted with his trademark icy passive-aggression.

&gt; After the Tory MP used his speech to accuse Bercow of being too lax over Vaz, the Speaker ordered Bridgen to sit down, admonishing him for &amp;quot;Extreme folly as well as sheer nastiness&amp;quot;.

&gt; Labour&amp;#039;s Chris Bryant, among nine MPs seeking to replace Bercow in an election process scheduled for Monday, told the Guardian last week he had recently walked out of the Commons chamber as he disliked the way the Speaker was chastising one Conservative.

Back in college we used koolaide, everclear/151, and some other smaller percent alcohol (think smirnoff). When made well you barely tasted alcohol but shit got you FUCKED UP.

Yep, there's a reason the first thing they tell you is not to drink the punch. It usually gets you fucked up.

This is where your comment starts to get fucked up.

And this makes you sound like a rapist. If she's that drunk don't sleep with her.

"gpumining","t5_2z759","I worry about electric costs because it's something you need to think about, if you are a HODLER like me your goal is to acquire as much crypto for the dollar spent, it's not that I can't afford the electric cost it's that I can BUY MORE crypto then I can mine for that electric cost, if electric costs exceed earnings then you get more by shutting down and just buying, there is zero reason to mine if your power costs exceed earnings anyway you look at it, if you are a short term miner and immediately sell then you are just straight losing money, if you are a long term miner and you are going for future value even if you end up selling at a loss because coin prices never recover you still lose less in that scenario because you have more coin to sell, to give an example, say I mine 80 cents worth of a coin but it costs me a Dollar to do it then that coin value NEVER increases and actually drops in half that coin i'm holding is now worth 40 cents, if I bought a dollars worth I would be getting 50 cents, now say it goes the other way and doubles in price and I sell, well the 80 cents becomes a $1.60 so I'm 60 cents profit over my power costs where if I bought it i'm a DOLLAR over my power costs.

The ONLY possible justification for mining at a loss is using mining to subsidize your ELECTRIC HEATING, because if you are running electric heat you are burning electricity and might as well burn it via mining.",1572566497

He made a lot of sense when we looked that one of the heaviest swords in the world weights around 3. something Kg and this thing is about 2 by itself. He believes that is a chimney key of some sort. He doesn't believe anything was attached at the bottom,  he actually think it was cut with a circular saw and since it was solid, then they drill their way through to detach the top of the key.

"FIFA","t5_2qxh7","I know that I will have a lot of flame but I have to tell that this card is not really good.

And the only reason is that acceleration, combining with poor agility and balance. When you have 3 of those as low stats, the trouble begins.

Through balls and high through balls are incredibly lethal right now and you will get destroyed with this card if you are not playing 1 or 2 depth with drop back. You cannot easily turn back and chase your opponent with those stats.

Much better than Umtiti though, but I will not do because of Militao - Varane - Lenglet trio, which are fitting more to meta as far as i believe.

Could be better than VVD if this card had 70+ acceleration and I would pay 200-300k more for it.

Varane is having the same issue with agility and balance, but his pace is so OP so he recovers quickly.",1572566498

"AcademicBiblical","t5_2w28m","&gt;There are witnesses saying that Matthew was written in Hebrew.

Actually, he doesn't. It's not clear what he is talking about or what **the elder** that he got his information from, was talking about. A Greek Matthew makes more sense and doesn't require
The additional assumption of a Hebrew Matthew,
As Ehrman [explains](

&gt;&gt;There was a long tradition throughout early and medieval Christianity that maintained that Matthew – commonly called the “most Jewish” of the Gospels – was written in Hebrew (or Aramaic).  Given its heightened Jewish concerns (see, for example, 5:17-20, verses found in no other Gospel), wasn’t it probably written to Jews in their native language?

&gt;&gt;There are two preliminary points to be made.  First, a number of scholars doubt if Matthew, or his community, was Jewish.  It is widely thought, instead, that Matthew portrays a Jesus who insists that his followers keep the Jewish law precisely because they were not accustomed to doing so, that is, that they are gentiles who have entered into a Christian community and are just learning that this community needs to follow the dictates of Scripture.

&gt;Second, even if Matthew and his audience were Jewish, that would not be evidence that he wrote in Hebrew or Aramaic.  Very few people wrote in Hebrew at this time, since the language of Palestine was Aramaic (a closely related language).  But there is little to suggest that Matthew’s Gospel was written in Palestine or to Aramaic speakers.   Few Jews outside of Palestine spoke Aramaic, and Jewish literature from outside (think Josephus, or Philo) was written in Greek.

&gt;&gt;There are compelling reasons for thinking Matthew wrote in Greek as well.  Here is one.  &gt;&gt;Since the 19th century it has been widely thought (on very convincing grounds that I won’t go into here) that Matthew used as one of his sources for his stories about Jesus the Gospel of Mark.   That would explain their massive word-for-word agreements in places.  But Mark was certainly composed in Greek.  Matthew therefore had to use a Greek version of Mark.  He copied it in places.  In Greek.  As a consequence, he must have been writing in Greek as well.  There’s no other plausible explanation for his verbatim alignments with Mark.

This is to say, that if Matthew was translated, there would be differences in word chice. Instead there's verbatim agreement. Your argument seems to rest on the idea that **There has to be a hebrew Matthew** because Papias, who is at best, a third hand witness, mentions someone named Matthew writing.",1572566501

Dad was diabetic, smoked, never took care of himself. Went in for bypass surgery was all set to come home, talked to him the day before, went to work the next day, got a call from my uncle who said I should come down to the hospital, when I got there my aunt said he passed about 20 mins ago.

Mum was a breast cancer survivor for over 10 years, but had developed a condition known as CREST from being administered too much radiation treatment so she was rapidly deteriorating. Still continued to smoke, her husband (not my dad), caused her added stress. Long story short, she got lung cancer and passed 3 days after mother's day.

I had visited her in the hospital that day with my brother and her best friend. We chatted and she was in good spirits despite being in pain. It was hard to watch, I had to excuse myself a couple times  to go cry. We all gradually left the room and I remember as I left the room and looked back at her she just had this look that was different, I can't explain it.

My wife and I were picking up a patio set in the city about an hour later my brother called and told me she was gone. I was inconsolable and sobbed outside of this strangers home.",1572566503

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA. I get that you were trying to be helpful but the extremely toxic way that women and girls are judged around weight causes huge self esteem issues in most of us. Also of note, ‘just lose weight’ is really hard for some people for a multitude of reasons. It’s troubling when people who find it easy to maintain a healthy weight assume that this is the case for everybody. There are loads of studies that back this up but even doctors regularly fall into this trap.

I’m also troubled by the “people are shallow” argument. In my experience that’s actually a good reason not to lose weight. Not being conventionally attractive is a great way to help keep (most of) the assholes away.

Also, for the others commenting on this, FFS she’s frustrated and venting to her family. That does not make her a female incel! If she’s saying the same things to random strangers, that would be a different matter.

"MrRobot","t5_37dnc","YES! I'm so glad this got someone else thinking as well, so many ways to unpack what they wanted this to mean (mostly kinda straightforward) but here are my takes:

* **Loss of identity:** Most straightforward point, but it's used as a metaphor to convey how Whiterose was feeling, a 'creature' that's hiding under the guise of something they are not; the loss of identity to the point you feel like a ""thing"", a monster to the outside world.
* **The birthing of a monster**: I read the death of Zhang's lover as the defining moment of where modern day White Rose was created, a glimpse into why we have the force of nature we have, I have a feeling there's more to this storyline and a bit more darkness and backstory to be explored post the suicide of his past lover that gives more context to Zhang/WR's current day urgency for more time.
* **Blurring the line of trust in those we previously thought we trusted via paranoia**: This points my favorite, I read a theory about Tyrell still being alive, and I know there's a Sam Esmail interview that confirms his death (but he's known to troll us), but when Tyrell is asking Elliot about who he cares for/what he cares for during their walk in the woods, it truly felt like Tyrell had some anger and hate for Elliot, it was too uncanny valley of a sendoff. How is Tyrell's son safe at this point if WR borderline gives the CEO position more as a threat than he does a request (""I have no doubt he'll accept""). It's the ones we least thought were monster that ARE the monster and thus, the notion that WR and Tyrell are working together to get Elliot is where my mind wandered.
   * This also might be a reach but this trust disparity is hinted at with Zhang's current assistant and the uneasiness she displays with Zhang's haste in making Wellick CEO...will WR's undoing be done via one of the ones she trusted? Similarly, Elliot being undone by Tyrell.
* **A potential hint into how this show is going to end:** The ending of ""The Thing"" is pretty much open to the audience's interpretation to who the monster was; did we kill it? Who was the true villain? Does it even matter who was the real villain? (Esmail Corp twitter account shared a very interesting photo from Clockwork Orange on their twitter earlier today: [https://twitter.com/esmailcorp/status/1189985687581278208](https://twitter.com/esmailcorp/status/1189985687581278208) that further gives credence to this type of ending)
* Extra easter egg: the song that played right before the trailer was *Culture Club's ""Time (Clock Of The Heart)""*, tastefully touching upon WR's obsession with time, and maybe even the real purpose of everything that's being done in modern day (time machine to prevent his lover to suicide? a reach but hey its time related...)

tl;dr: the identification of feeling like a thing, an origin story for white rose, don't trust anyone, some thoughts into how the show may end",1572566504

"writing","t5_2qh2n","This will mirror what a lot of others have said, but here's my 2 cents. This comes from two of my personal writing idols.

Joe R. Lansdale said, ""Every day, write something. If you can't write something, then write anything."" He said he has sat down to write and found his mind utterly blank with nothing for any of his current WIPs and no new ideas, so he started writing. He has *literally* written things like, ""This morning, for breakfast, I had two eggs, some bacon, and a cup of juice. The dog snoozed on my foot as I ate, and ..."" That was enough to jump start him, and he'd get an idea for one of his WIPs and resume work on that. He also said he saves all those impromptu bits of writing, and quite a few of them have turned into stories of their own.

When I got serious about my writing, I used Joe as my role model. He writes 3 - 5 pages each day. I don't remember if he does that six days a week or seven, but, basically, every day. I thought, ""That seems reasonable."" It wasn't. Not for me. Not when I started, and it's still not a pace I can maintain for more than a few months at a stretch. My most consistent output average is 1 - 2 pages per day. The fact that I couldn't meet that (self-imposed) criteria hurt. Intellectually, I knew it shouldn't. I knew sitting down to write each day was the key, and that progress is progress, even if it's tiny. A hundred words was better than zero, but it still rankled. Part of me felt like a failure. It was a small part and easily silenced, but it was still there.

Then I found ""The Machine"" by Steven Barnes. This is a handful of guidelines, the specific number varies depending on when he writes it out, but the first step is always, ""Write one sentence per day."" Reading that guideline allowed me the room to reframe my own internal dialog, and I gave myself permission to let go of the 2 - 3 pages per day and go with the one sentence per day model. After a few weeks, I realized a couple of things. First, it was basically impossible for me to *not* write a sentence per day. Second, and this ties into Joe's advice, that one sentence almost always turns into a paragraph or a page or two. On my best day, that one sentence led to ten pages. It has spurred me to write 5+ pages on several occasions, and 3 - 5 pages is not uncommon for me.",1572566505

Not to mention the massive buffs and debuffs every three months that completely screw ur build and u have to start from scratch ( this is not an overstatement) just so three months later they roll back all the changes from last patch and add a few more which changes the entire class again, and then u have to AGAIN change your build, your skills, get new gear coz the ones u were using before arent going to cut.


And then, guess what? It happens again, they change everything AGAIN! And now everything u did goes to waste and you have to start over, learn your class again, and u cant even remember the changes they did six months ago coz they changed the game so drasticly that they were overwritten.
No explanation is given about the changes either with the exception of half a dozen.

And the really, really bad performance.

While in gw2, during a world boss, with tons of ppl around me the highest my ping went was 190.

In wow, even in a crowded boralus, it never went above 200.

In eso, in a good day, alone in my own house, which is instanced, i get 250 at least, but more often the not, 300+. Also the random loading screens, crashes and rollbacks that happens in cyrodill. ( Which arent only with me, u cant play for more than 30min in cyrodill without seeing someone complaining about lag.

And recently, they deactivated the activity finder, which completely negates the ability to do battlegrounds, since that was the only way to get in a match. I dont know if they reversed that change, im not playing it anymore, ive had enough, but a lot of ppl lost their main way of pvping, battlegrounds.

I’ve done it twice so far in 2 weeks and my hair looks SO much better it’s actually crazy. All I do is soak about 1/2 cup of brown rice in 2-3 cups of water for 30 mins, strain out the rice and put the remaining water in a large bowl, and just dunk my hair in the bowl &amp; squish the water in (but I shampoo my hair before doing this) Pour the rest over my hair &amp; then put it in a shower cap for 30 mins to let it soak.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","What I support is parents actually doing something about their children misbehaving. The daughter has not learned her lesson after getting in trouble for the same thing time and time again. What gets a kids attention? Taking some they love. You’re teaching them that if they aren’t going to listen, there will be consequences. If you don’t learn from the first type of consequence, you’re going to get a new one. She can’t wear too much make up if she doesn’t have any to wear - makes perfect sense. This will teach her she can’t do whatever she wants. 

You know what happens when you do whatever you want and don’t follow the rules in the real world? You lose your job. Might as well learn as a kid that misbehaving results in things you want being taken from you. Better she learn with make up than income.

What would you have done instead? Sit down with her and have a quiet heart to heart and ask how this makes her feel? Then take her answer and go to her principal about it? Try and change the rules of the school because your kid thinks she should be able to do as she pleases? Tell us the proper way to handle this then, Karen.

And how old are you that you use minutes as an example 😂. Paying for her own make up isn’t teaching her anything. Use an example that works here. 

 &gt; Punishment is meant to teach your child lessons, not to relieve your irritation.

It tends to do both. Kid learns to follow rules. Parent is no longer frustrated.",1572566507

I once was at a bachelor party where everyone had prepared an honest story to tell. That worked out great. Life lessons were shared. It was years ago and it's still sometimes talked about.

It might not be ""tradition"" in your mind. But you're doing this for your friend. So ask yourself what he would like, honour his wishes and make it memorable for him.

His grandfather was cash at the time and bought farming land for pennies on the dollar and grew corn.
His son (dad of guy i know) used the land as his stake in 1/3rd of a cattle farm with two brothers who lost their farm (use my land, run the farm, i get 1/3rd and do no work). he then bought some real estate ""company"". His son (guy I know) took it over when it was worth about 4 million sold his share of the farm for 2 more million and bought some more real estate. now he has 3 shit apartment complexes, a strip mall, and some stake in a few restaurants. He also has a few mill in regular indexes and msft.

"Animemes","t5_2w6fe","For the uninitiated! Monogatari spoilers (seriously, avoid this one if you plan to watch it; it's a good reveal).

&gt;!Ougi Oshino is introduced as the niece of Meme Oshino, who is the specialist who helps out Araragi early on (but disappears for the bulk of this story). She appears shortly after they become aware of the phenomenon known as ""The Darkness"" (IIRC) which destroys apparitions which misrepresent themselves as something else. It went after the vampiress ""Kiss Shot Heart Under Blade"" or whatever pretended she was a goddess. It went after snail girl after she was released from her curse but dragged feet on moving on to the next life, calling herself a ""free wandering spirit"" or something. And it went after Ougi Oshino, because she was actually an apparition, a manifestation of Araragi's wounded sense of justice, calling herself Oshino's niece.!&lt;

&gt;!It was all set to destroy her, when Araragi applied the lesson initially learned by Cat-Tiger-Girl (I'm terrible with names): failing to accept one's failings is how apparations appear in the first place. The moment Araragi declared that he didn't care, he was going to try to protect Ougi from the Darkness, Meme was able to appear, acknowledge Ougi as his niece, thus fooling the Darkness into giving up on destroying her.!&lt;

Thus, while I get that OP was probably saying ""Ha ha, ur waifu isnt real"" (though who would put Ougi in this role, I'll never know), I interpreted it as, &gt;!""Ougi isn't human, but an apparration"" and responded by referencing Oshino's acceptance of her as family, thus protecting her from the Darkness.!&lt;",1572566512

Celestial Dragons are considered as gods in OP, and attacking one would be the most evil of acts. Even if those ""gods"" don't deserve to be called such.
In contrast, the D clan is shown to each have rebellious spirits guiding them. They may have some amount of authority (Garp=Vice Admiral, Dragon=Leader of Revolutionary Army, etc.) They still have nowhere near the total control of the planet that the CD's have. Yet they still rebel against societal norms because it works for their ideals and goals.

I just hope she is okay, I feel like she needed this launch to be a win and I'm so glad it has been for her so far!

I honestly wasn't going to order it until I watched her and Rachhloves' videos, as soon as I saw those creamy mattes and glitters in action I knew I needed them lol. I am also allergic to gluten and sensitive to fragrance so it's really nice to be able to buy her products without having to worry about some of the ingredients I usually stay away from because she is so picky with her ingredients as well.

Let me spell this out for you. Nice and slow. Because your reading comprehension is clearly sub par. 

THAT. IS. NOT. WHAT. IS. HAPPENING. That's not how the mechanic works. It never has. There is no evidence of that. What happens is, someone kites, or stuns or otherwise gets out of hit range for a mob with thrashing. It stores up the thrash hits. And then, this is crucial please pay VERY close attention. 

They while still in combat with that same person. catch up. and deliver all the thrashes at once. 

Now, combine this with spell caching. And you get some wonkiness of spike damage.

"VeganBeauty","t5_31m9x","A few areas I find murky..

The quote you referenced is not on their website presently. It was once on Cruelty-Free Kitty's site as being from them, but their site isn't loading to verify. Their stance may have changed, hence them shortening it?* Unknown.

I would also consider intention vs actual testing to be a murky area. According to them, no animal testing is presently occuring with Vanicream products. However, their intentions don't seem to align with zero cruelty since they are not taking a firm stance and have at least previously noted that they will if required by law. If they don't sell in countries that don't test, they could have just been straight up and said they're cruelty-free. Advertise it even. I'd say it's a situation akin to buying accidentally vegan products.

Kind of like how we all think that people *should* use science because we think that science is good. Just because some regions of the world use science moreso than other regions doesn't mean that using science is bad in those regions.

&gt;But in the bible it says to worship false gods is a sin. So isn’t it  unfair of God to automatically punish people by virtue of where they  were born?

People aren't punished based on where they are born. People grow up and make their own choices as adults. If the local religion is wrong, and your choice is to ""just do what everyone else is doing"", then you're ""punished"" for *that choice* rather than because of where you grew up.

I literally said in my last comment that having a kid was exhausting. In no way did I discount your experience and say yours doesn’t count. I have kids I know it’s hard. I’m still not going to say things that imply other people can’t be just as tired, if not more than me because they don’t have kids.

The first line in your originally comment edit about kids is just not at all reasonable with how it was stated. They might consider having kids, they might not at all. But according to you even if have kids, they still won’t know what tired is.

It’s absolutely fine to use your experience with having kids as a comparison. You brought up several good points with what you said that I don’t have a problem with at all. Just in the future please don’t say it in a snarky way that implies that it is the absolute truth when you don’t know it is. Especially when with a little common sense it isn’t.  

It really doesn’t take life experience to know that raising a kid isn’t the most tiring thing in the world. There’s a million more things that can be just, if not more tiring (not just jobs). Any of which OP may still experience in their life. You are right unless we have experience it we really don’t know which is harder, but faced with the relatively common knowledge that those things exist I can’t see how you can justify raising a kid as being the most tiresome with such certainty when you haven’t experienced those other things.

It’s comment like that that were all over parenting groups on Facebook that made me had to leave out of embarrassment of association. It just sounds so patronizing to people that don’t have kids, yet have gone through other hardships.",1572566517

*Dammit ClownDonkey, you're never going to make it at masturbating, stop being such a wanker!*

If you mean the latter, tread carefully. Marking the nominative with a suffix is generally weird. Uncommonly, some languages decline for both nominative and accusative (see Latin); a rare few mark only the nominative and leave the accusative as the root (see Icelandic).

"EternalCardGame","t5_3byur","One thing that seems to be true across many if not all card games is that people will complain about control constantly except in the most outlandish of circumstances. Like ""more than 40% of the meta is the same non-control deck"" circumstances. Ixtun unitless doesn't even have the 1.19% representation of Hooru (from the last Meta Monday) and people still complain about it. 

Eternal has cards that basically read ""answer this immediately or lose"" (Xo, Teacher, Ramba), cards that inherently cantrip or better (Heart, Xo, Xulta Arcanum, Ramba once you're late enough in the game), and cards that are inherently resilient to removal (Icaria and Xulta Arcanum, outside of Edict of Shavka). Oh, and don't forget Kairos, which turns *every single 3+ power creature* into ""answer this immediately or lose"" because you need to get to Brilliant Idea amplified once, or Channel the Tempest if you want to draw 3 cards at once, while midrange gets draw 5 stapled to a 12/12 (who is also himself ""answer this immediately or lose"").

What people don't seem to understand is that while it doesn't seem fair that a 2-mana removal spell can kill a unit with a much bigger mana investment, there's a factor that balances that out: There are no wrong threats, but there are wrong answers. Every single unit with at least 1 attack will eventually win the game if left unanswered (blockers can count as answers too), but removal has to match up against its target for it to be useful. For some cards it's obvious because it just doesn't kill the target, like Annihilate vs multicolor cards or Torch vs things with 4+ health, but even cards that kill anything have weaknesses. E.g. Desecrate frequently reads ""kill target creature next turn"" because 3 damage is like getting another swing in. Harsh Rule costs 5 and if you can't kill 5 cost worth of units then your opponent is pulling ahead on mana efficiency. Same goes for the various 4-cost removal like Deathstrike and Feeding Time - if your removal costs more than the thing it's killing, you're falling behind. 

Control also has to make a decision about what removal to keep, and how much of it, completely blind. If you keep Torch in your opener and your opponent goes Auralian Merchant, SST, Heart of the Vault, you may as well have taken the -1 from a mulligan. Lean on Pristine Light and you lose if your opponent drops a bunch of 3-attack units. If you draw the wrong half of your answers, you just lose vs fast decks and start behind vs slow decks. It's an inherent weakness of reactive strategies, but unlike Magic there's no games 2 or 3 to make up for it, and unlike Hearthstone you don't get extra information by seeing your opponent's class. 

And on top of that - I glossed over this earlier, but midrange has gotten so many threats that produce card advantage. If control attempts to answer these threats 1-for-1, it will run out of answers before midrange runs out of threats (remember, no wrong threats, only wrong answers). Xo cantrips before you even play him. Heart of the Vault is a cantrip stapled to a 6/6 at worst, is a +2 if you warp him or kill something, and is a +3 if you do both. Xulta Arcanum is even worse - kill the site, and you still have to deal with a pair of aegis 2/2s. Or maybe they just drew cards first and you're now 2 cards behind them. And all that's without going into how difficult it is to answer the site outside of Edict.

So let's say you're on Hooru control or unitless or whatever and the opponent drops Heart of the Vault into an empty board on turn 8 or 9. If you answer Heart, you traded 1-for-1 but the opponent got to draw a card off that while you didn't. You'll need a card draw spell to catch up, and hope you continue drawing only the removal that's actually relevant, rather than drawing, say Defiance vs SST. Channel the Tempest puts you ahead and is the only card in stock Unitless that has that property. If you leave it up, the opponent can do one of three things. First, just attack with it and put you in the same spot next turn but minus 6 life. Second, they can drop a second threat, you drop Harsh Rule or Pristine Light, and you come out ahead. Third, they can drop Kairos, draw 6, and put you in a nearly unwinnable spot. Even if you clear the board after that, they have 6 cards over you and can just do the same play pattern over and over again. Xo is the same way except you can't leave it up because they draw a ton of treasures and bury you in cards even without Kairos. Midrange has showed up on control's home turf of card advantage and beaten it at its own game. 

After all this, people say that control is annoying to play against, which, yeah, it is. It sucks if they have all the right answers but I don't think that's a good reason to give midrange the sort of absurd pushed cards they get and have been getting. Could you imagine if control got a card that killed all units and drew cards equal to how many were killed? Or a site that staples together Harsh Rule and some other useful card? People would riot and threaten to quit in droves. But here we are in a meta where the best harsh rule deck is (arguably) FTJ greed pile and somehow Unitless control is still the problem.",1572566520

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","&gt; Is Socialism a Farther No Objection? Why A Charter Of The World Of Education Is The Largest Threat The World Has Ever Seen

I guess, I'm assuming it's because we were taught to believe that money and freedom were the only things that mattered.  For a lot of people, that's not true.  In this particular example, I don't think it's a big deal because everyone in the world is free to choose.  If this is true, then you can think about the state as a tool to facilitate social mobility.  I would go further by saying that in the US, this means that we have more people in the country who are able to have more choices as opposed to just being able to choose.

&gt;We're all forced to make our own choices for us, including our own money.

The basic reason we don't choose is because we don't have the time and money to research, think, and write our own things.  It's because we're afraid and insecure.  And I don't think we don't know what it is like to be a person who is insecure.  It's a state of being that is not something that you are meant to learn about.

If you think that I think freedom is a tool used by some kind of government to enforce laws, then I will tell you this is not true.  There's a lot of people who are afraid of a government.  You can't change the basic nature of a society.  There's a lot of people who are just as insecure as you.

&gt;In the US, we have the freedom to choose between a car and a gun.

I agree.  But the reason we're not allowed to choose is because society is in such a state of insecurity now.  That's why there have been so few gun-related deaths in the US since 9/11.

&gt;We value a strong government to ensure it has enough power to enforce laws, to protect people, and to protect property.

In that same way, I would agree that a gun is a weapon.  But in the US, there is still a government that's gun control and wants to turn it into a weapon.",1572566520

&gt; ISIS Confirms Baghdadi&amp;#039;s Death And Names His Successor The Islamic State named Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi as its new leader days after ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a U.S. raid on his compound in northwest Syria.

&gt; In the announcement, both Baghdadi and former ISIS spokesman Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir were praised as &amp;quot;Martyrs.""

&gt; McKenzie said the Defense Intelligence Agency was able to confirm identification of Baghdadi &amp;quot;Beyond a shadow of a doubt.&amp;quot; Using DNA samples retrieved from the tunnel and comparing them with samples taken when the ISIS leader was detained at Iraq&amp;#039;s Camp Bucca prison in 2004 &amp;quot;Produced a level of certainty that the remains belong to Baghdadi 1 in 104 septillion,&amp;quot; said McKenzie.

I think part of it has been the terrible experience I’ve had at my home program, with some shaky extrapolation that if a low tier program was a bad experience with poor training and support, a lower tier residency would have a less good experience than one that’s more highly ranked. However, if I’m being honest with myself, a larger part is just plain ego. After four years of not being proud of my program, I want to be able to hold my head high when I say where I trained. 

There are some lower ranked programs I know I would be just as proud of training at because of the strength of their program and dedication to their mission, but that devil on my shoulder keeps trying to steer me away from them.

As I’m typing this out I’m realizing how ridiculous it all sounds, but I guess it’s just four years of insecurity and borderline trauma I’m going to have to work through before rank lists are due",1572566522

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

KAT was still fired up, and woulda gone after embiid again if ben let him go cause he was still pissed, ben needed everything im sure too hold him down, honestly, ben prob saved both him and embiid from getting a longer suspension        
hence the nickname 'peacemaker' :)     
if ben got into the twitter beef im sure he woulda got drilled, but he didn't, cause he's friends with both.      
and KAT still comes across good for his 'soft' image as far as most are concerned im sure, it was pretty much 2 7ft's v 1, he wasn't soft n said he aint gonna back down from nobody, even bully ball smash mouth 6ers in the east, handled the press well n still got into the twitter beef after - prob even won that joel went too far there.",1572566523

It also depends on how many people play in the tournaments you enter, and the tournament structure. If you enter big field tournaments with a fast structure, 400 buy ins may even be advisable. 

However, I'd actually suggest just going for $50-$60, and just playing the $1 tournaments, with as slower structure and small of a field you can find. If you deposit $200, you might get tempted to ""take shots"" at higher buy ins, whereas you should be sticking to the low stakes tournaments until you have a big enough sample to show that you're a winning player in them. If you do bust your roll, it's not the end of the world having to deposit another $50.  

Also, don't just bink a 1st place in a $1 tournament, then think you can beast your way through $10-$15 tournaments, they will be significantly tougher.",1572566526

"1200isplenty","t5_2xk5e","Breakfast: coffee with 2 tbsp half and half (39 cals) — I wake up pretty late and aren’t usually hungry for breakfast. 

Lunch: 12 TJ’s mini chicken cilantro wontons (150 cals) in chicken broth (114 cals), with half a chicken sausage cut up (60 cals) and a handful of spinach and a few sliced mushrooms (20 cals) thrown in the broth. Half of a homemade oatmeal chocolate cookie for dessert (52 cals). In total, 395 cals for a super random lunch thrown together just based on what I had, but it was tasty and filling! Those mini wontons are life savers. 

Snack cuz I was feeling snacky: pack of seaweed snacks (30 cals), 2 TJs truffle chips (I dunno, just estimated 30 cals), one gummy cola candy (13 cals) for a total of 75 cals. 

Dinner: Homemade poke bowl with 3/4 cup of sushi rice seasoned with some rice vinegar (203 cals), about 5 oz ahi tuna, a handful of raw julienned carrots, lots of ribbons of cucumber, sliced radish &amp; red onion, about 1/4c edamame peas, a bit of wakame seaweed, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and dressing (398 cals). A small 3oz glass of Chardonnay (71 cals). 672 cals for dinner and I’m truly stuffed. I’m always surprised how filling poke bowls are for the calories. If I’m eating out I ask them to sub half the rice for salad and it’s still plenty of rice. 

That puts me at 1181 for the day. I normally target  closer to 1500 but had bigger days on the last 2 days, so I guess I’m not as hungry today.",1572566527

The episode, in fact, draws a really sharp contrast between her idle musings with the vicious tirade Maki's dad delivers at the end. You might notice that they're actually identical in content: high school is worthless, trying is worthless. But in Maki's dad, we see someone who probably lived those words, and is trying to hurt someone by saying them. Whereas Mitsue says them to Yuta (and not to the people she's criticizing), as they both moon over their crushes, because Mitsue doesn't actually want to be cruel and doesn't really believe in them.

I don't know if Mitsue will actually mature over the course of this series (it'd be pretty realistic if she didn't, in keeping with so much about this show). But the show has shown us how she's already outgrown her own words, and how much room there is for her to grow, unlike Maki dad, who is as stunted and pathetic as he's terrifying.",1572566527

I said impeached if not removed. 

I doubt he will be removed by the Senate before the election. I would bet on two possibilities: Impeached before election, voted out before trial or the House decides not to impeach until the election, voted out. 

A bit more unlikely is House decides not to impeach, wins election, impeached after election, possibly removed depending on the senate makeup. 

Clearly you don’t see the problem of a White House tainted with visible signs of corruption and nepotism. Giving a middle finger to the rest of the world is not my idea of “winning”. I am pretty liberal but I would rather have an actual economically conservative President over Trump. The “merit” you speak of does not matter as ends do not justify the means. 

Any economic conservative could have achieved the same if not better statistics. 

Arguing over the statistics too, you cannot deny that unemployment was decreasing at a similar rate under Obama, GDP % increase was higher in parts of Obama’s last 2 years than is now, stock market volatility has increased.

This is why revisionism is so important. I actually had an anthropology professor that pointed this out and boy did it blow some peoples hair back.

&gt; The fossils of an ancient, 150-million-year-old sea monster were recently discovered in Poland.

&gt; Tyborowski, who said that the fossil finds were a first for Poland, hopes the researchers will discover more large reptile fossils in the &amp;quot;Next months and years&amp;quot; at the site.

&gt; In December, the fossil of a 180-million-year-old &amp;quot;Sea monster&amp;quot; from the Jurassic era was discovered with evidence of blubber and skin, making the creature more similar to modern-day dolphins than previously thought.

Gale is wearing yellow when he gets shot by Jesse. Jesse is wearing red. (red also signals danger but usually with more violence imo)

"traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns","t5_2uog0","&gt;with a little weight lifting

With a lot of weight lifting. You don't just lose default muscle. You lose the ease with which to build muscle. Testosterone is pretty important for building muscle. The anti-androgens most trans women take until they get an orchi, and even after the orchi when they stop taking anti-androgens, results in lower t levels than the average cis woman.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, for those that transition after puberty, you end up with larger than average cis woman's bone structure being powered by a roughly average cis woman's muscles. At the risk of making a bad analogy, it's like swapping out your car engine for a motorbike engine. You tire significantly more on estrogen. I do take your point but it really isn't as easy as you make it sound. Chances are the average post-transition woman will not be stronger than she was pre-transition. Even if she regularly works out.

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, if she's willing to work out post-transition she was probably working out prior to as well. Either way, the ease of building muscles is going to be dependent on genetic luck and how much you're really willing to throw into weight lifting.",1572566531
"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","My pain was very well managed, so what I experienced was mostly just soreness rather than anything especially painful. The first few weeks were unpleasant and I was sore, but it wasn't unbearable by any means. By 8 weeks I had very little soreness and was using the largest (1.5"" diameter) dilator, and by month 3 I had no soreness and was back to riding my bicycle. I was fortunate in that I regained sexual sensation very early on -- sometimes it can take folks *months* to regain sensation.

I'm now almost 7 months post-op, I haven't had any soreness or discomfort in a *long* time, and I've been very sexually active with my boyfriend. PIV sex is great, and we have a wonderful sex life!

Aesthetically I'm *very* happy, and I don't really have any  need for aesthetic revisions. My boyfriend has said the only thing that really feels a little different is that I'm consistently a bit tighter than cis women (and he can compare easily because he's married to one), but otherwise it feels the same to him.",1572566531

&gt; Tyborowski, who said that the fossil finds were a first for Poland, hopes the researchers will discover more large reptile fossils in the &amp;quot;Next months and years&amp;quot; at the site.

&gt; In December, the fossil of a 180-million-year-old &amp;quot;Sea monster&amp;quot; from the Jurassic era was discovered with evidence of blubber and skin, making the creature more similar to modern-day dolphins than previously thought.

"u_LawNation","t5_nvxck"," Josh to Dallas??? My answer is a simple NO.....  The New England Patriots are parting ways with Pro Bowl wide receiver Josh Gordon.  League sources told ESPN and NFL Media on Thursday that Gordon is being released off injured reserve by the Patriots. The All-Pro receiver was playing through a left knee injury before being knocked out of New England’s victory over the New York Giants on Oct. 10.  In that game, Gordon injured his knee while attempting to make a tackle after a fumble by the Patriots. According to ESPN, New England used the minor designation for his placement on IR, indicating that the wideout’s injury wasn’t significant.  Due to the designation, the Patriots were required to release Gordon upon his return to full health. He will be subject to waivers and other NFL teams can put in a claim for his services.  In six games with the Patriots this season, Gordon recorded 20 receptions for 287 yards and one touchdown. He started 11 games for New England last season, notching 40 catches for 720 yards and three receiving scores.  In December, the 28-year-old receiver was suspended indefinitely for violating the terms of his conditional reinstatement under the league’s substance-abuse policy. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell lifted his suspension in August.",1572566533

I worked as a cashier and I was watching someone do a bottle count (return bottles/cans for the deposit) and the person training me wasn't sure if a bottle had a deposit. He walked over to an open register where someone is being actively rung up, and scans the bottle, sees that it has a deposit, and then removes the charge.

The man getting groceries did NOT care for that at ALL and decided that I, the one least involved, was the one to get the brunt of the abuse. He started screaming at me and i was holding back tears. He then yelled about me making a face at him. I explained ""sir, I am trying not to cry because you are being very mean"" and then I went to the break room to calm down.",1572566533

Get a professional therapist who has experience dealing with narcissists and for the love of God don't let her near them, they will try and manipulate the therapist, that's how low they will go.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","This is completely anecdotal from my own experience. During my history of disordered eating and crash diets, I found that eating at too large a caloric deficit led to a drastic decrease in my NEAT activity - I felt tired and sluggish a lot of the time, and slept poorly which made that even worse; was much more unlikely to engage in any sort of physical activity outside of planned exercise, and even then I couldn’t physically workout very hard or long. That would mean a temporary decrease in the calories-out metabolism, and I believe that’s why it seemed like I could only eat very few calories to maintain my weight. Contrasted to now, I’ve lost weight over several years eating much more closely to my maintenance calories, and I have so much more energy for daily life and exercise, that I’m able to even lose weight eating a lot more food. It’s not that my metabolism was damaged, just the metabolic equation was changed temporarily, and that made it much harder to lose weight and keep it off over time.

I don’t have any scientific evidence or anything, but I wonder if this is one factor people are experiencing when they talk about dieting seeming to lower their metabolism.",1572566533

Gold has high specular reflectivity, but I could produce something textured that would minimize the effect, or I might be able to use it advantageously. I could place a white surface above and a black one below. It would reflect the white in visible and show the black in UV. 

Is there any way to look up information like this for various materials? I need a scientific term more precise than color to describe things that have high reflectivity in certain wavelengths.

Edit: Maybe “reluctance”, but I’m still not finding a lot of information on different materials. Are there sources on this with charts like [this one](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance#/media/File%3AImage-Metal-reflectance.png) for a variety of materials?

"CompetitiveForHonor","t5_3bbel","Honestly, I think having UB lights and finishers would have worked really well... if the lights weren't 600ms, or if they had a similar animation to the heavy finishers ([which they don't](https://youtu.be/VQLQeJyiDh4?t=2027)). Unfortunately this means that they are going to be parriable on reaction pretty easily, which means you'll be getting much more use out of the heavy finishers than the light finishers, at least in 1v1s. In team fights, you'll be able to target switch them, which could make them very useful, as long as the recoveries aren't abysmal... 

It just seems like a missed opportunity to me, as at 18 damage 600ms, they'll be pretty poor at a competitive level, but decent at a more casual level. But they could have made them 15 damage and 500ms, and they might have been decent at a competitive level, and not dramatically more powerful for the regular playerbase. Maybe they'll buff the speed somewhere down the line, potentially by 33ms or 66ms, because I doubt that they'll be working well after players get used to them.

Another way I'd like to see light unblockables be a viable mix-up would be if their properties varied depending on the direction of the previous attack. Imagine enhanced 500ms light openers, with chain lights that are either 400ms (or 366ms) and unblockable (13 damage), or 600ms (or 566ms or something) and not unblockable (18 damage). And heavies that are either UB or regular too. But the chain attacks only become unblockable if performed in the same guard direction as the opener. That way you have to prediction parry in the direction you blocked the opener (if they do the UB light), or wait and parry the other directions.",1572566536

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if dankT3 has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=dankT3&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L4) Check dankT3's [**Spam History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), [**RedditMetis profile**](https://www.redditmetis.com/user/dankT3), or [**Atomiks Analyzer Profile**](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#dankT3), or [Redetective profile](https://www.redective.com/) [**!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gcdeletes+gcremoves+gcmirror+gcarchive+gcalerts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

It's basically a narcissists version of NO U in an argument. Of course he's going to call you manipulative, it's because HE IS. He's deflecting the blame onto and you're falling for it. 

You need to get out of this relationship and stay single. You aren't capable of seeing red flags, and if you can't see red flags you will stay in abusive relationships no matter who you date. You need to work on yourself. You seem to have self-esteem issues and that's something a therapist can definitely help with. Just ask yourself, why do you think this is what you deserve? Why do you think this is the best you can get? Normal men don't prey on 20 year olds, ever, and this man clearly knows about your low self-esteem. 

I would suggest accepting the advice that's being given to you. You aren't the abuser, he is, now accept it and move on and ditch this guy.

My mother on the other hand never behaved like one. Ever. She never wanted kids in the first place, viewing kids as bank account-bleeding parasites who rob you of your hopes and dreams. She never cared, never loved, never taught, never did anything that parents would normally do, besides keeping us alive. Alive, but not happy.

Have you measured your freezer's power consumption?  You need to do that before sizing backup power for it.

Fwiw my own fridge seems to only run at 100% or 0%.  It never uses intermediate amounts of power.  I measured with a Kill-a-watt meter which was about 20 bucks at a hardware store, a very useful gadget, recommended.",1572566543

&gt; AMMAN - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Thursday that his government&amp;#039;s ultimate goal was to restore state authority over Kurdish controlled areas in northeast Syria after an abrupt U.S. troop withdrawal but he expected it to happen gradually.

&gt; The U.S.-allied Kurdish YPG militia reached a deal with Damascus to take up positions near the border after U.S. President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s announcement in early October that he was withdrawing American forces from northeast Syria.

&gt; Syria had a right to defend its territorial integrity against separatist Kurds who aspired to create a Kurdish state and rule over Arabs and other ethnic groups, Assad said.

"Socialism_101","t5_2ys9x","You're missing the point. 

The concept of alienation itself is based on an ontological rupture of the human subject (Herbert Marcuse goes into great detail on this subject). Alienation from labor via exploitation is not a violation of a ""right"" according to Marx, but rather a dialectical tension within the human subject created by the capitalist mode of production which must be resolved. The value created by labor is part of the Being of the human subject and, as such, so is the value which is thereby created - So man's alienation from his labor is alienation from his own Being. 

The point here is that the notion of ""self ownership"" and the conception of the justice or injustice of property (communal or otherwise) is built into the basic assumptions of western political theory - including Marxism.

Marx never spoke of rights bc he was neither a proponent of natural rights nor social contract theory, but rather a hegelian who explicitly framed his narrative in terms of dialectical tensions of ontology, while this ontological aspect is more implicit within Locke's conceptualization of property bc the ontology is mediated by god in the form of natural rights.",1572566545

I got to a point where I could feel that my heart was going to give out any day, like physically feel how hard it was working. I was dizzy all the time, I just knew I was going to die. It was terrifying. I had finally recovered enough from depression that I wasn’t suicidal, so I was scared to die. But I still couldn’t get myself to stop purging, working out 3 hours a day, abusing laxatives, and starving.

I went to residential for the fifth time, was there for 2 months. I basically spent July 2016 - October 2018 constantly in and out of residential. I had a tradition of spending my last night out of residential with my best friend, and we were out chain smoking and holding hands and I just remember breaking down and telling him, “I’m so hungry.” Did an intensive day program for like 3 weeks after that (basically once I had decided I was going to recover and gained the weight, I was done lol so I didn’t need much time). I still see a therapist and dietician, but just for maintenance. I actually mostly focus on body fat percentage stuff with working out!

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA with compassion, because I spent a long time also being The Person Who Hates Being In Pictures. I didn't even get wedding or graduation pictures. Even now, I rarely take selfies to post on social media.

HOWEVER, over the years I've come to a realization that when it comes to these kinds of snapshots, I need to let go of my insecurities and not make it all about myself when it comes to pictures that other people want to take to commemorate their events. Because if your reasoning is that you're worried about your appearance, then that's just vanity. It demonstrates just as much vanity to refuse to be in any pictures as it does to primp and preen like you're the Next Top Model.

For one thing, I look how I look. I can't walk around with the face I got and then blame the camera because it didn't turn me into Margot Robbie. I look like a normal person, and for someone my age (old) I don't look half bad. Yes, I have some face wrinkles and eyebags, and harsh overhead light does me no favors. But fuck, I'm not gonna walk around with a bag over my head and retire to the attic because I don't look like some 25 year old fashion model. I wouldn't do it in real life.

My family likes my face, my friends like my face, my SO likes my face. To that end, if I can practice smiling and posing so it looks somewhat natural and I don't appear like I have a sniper off-camera pointing an AR-15 at my brain pan, then I can increase the odds that I'll look like the best version of myself. And friends willing to try to take more than one picture to get a good one only help me in that regard.

But even if the light makes me look like I'm telling campfire tales or my hair looks weird, I have learned to let it slide - because it's not just ""my"" picture, it's not about me and how great I look (or how like shit I think I look). I'm one of the people in the picture helping the person who wants the picture for a memento of a special occasion. And it is special, in part because I'm there helping to make it special. That's what the picture is about.

And cool costumes are special occasions. Formal events are special occasions. Graduations are very special occasions! If you're dressed up and gonna have fun, it's a good occasion for a picture! To commemorate your special day!

There will come a time down the road when you'll look back on these types of pictures and be glad you have some. The cringe factor will wear off, the emotions will fade and eventually you'll look back at yourself and go, hey, I didn't look so bad, I was actually pretty cute. Or hey, I remember being that thin. Or hey, I remember when \[embarrassing clothing trend\] was soooo fashionable, who let us dress like that?! LOL! In other words, you will not have the cringe, you'll just have the memories.

Look, in this day and age, you don't HAVE to be faced with the mortifying evidence of pictures you're in, staring you in the face. You just untag yourself if you feel they're too excruciating for now. Hell, you can filter them if you want to get rid of giant zits or bad shadows. What bad pictures?! But I bet you don't look at pictures when you were 5 opening an awesome Xmas present and go, ""oh fuck, I was such a loser of a kindergartener."" You probably just remember getting that awesome Xmas present and maybe laugh at the dinosaur pajamas.

Don't get me wrong, I still get ""agh"" when people take my picture and once again, the camera has failed to turn me into Margot Robbie. I looked like shit at the Grand Canyon, lol. But at least I have a picture of the time I went to the Grand Canyon. I have pictures of when I went to Yosemite. And Ireland. And Niagara Falls. I have pictures of me with my parents, who won't be around forever. And my sisters, who, who knows? We won't be around forever, either. I have pictures with the special people in my life. Not because we all look gorgeous, but because we're special to each other and the pictures help us remember our special times.

So, be a hermit when it comes to selfies. No one's forcing you to update your profile pic every 3 seconds. But don't be a dick when other people want you in their picture, and deprive them of THEIR memories by refusing to be in it. That's actually pretty selfish. It's not all about you. It took me way longer to realize that myself than it should have.",1572566547

"MensLib","t5_38jid","Radiolab did a really interesting episode a while back that touches on a lot of what you're speaking about but from a different direction. The episode starts out with the story of a man who was in a car accident and ended up having brain surgery that changed his personality. He was later charged with a serious crime and part of his defense was that his brain surgery made him incapable of resisting the temptation to commit the crime. He had a neurosurgeon testify on his behalf that the changes that were made to his brain during a surgery made it very difficult for him to resist certain temptations.

 I won't spoil the episode for you, but Radiolab does an excellent job looking at both sides of the argument ""my biology made me do it."" The piece covers a lot of ground, exploring the scientific evidence for claims of this sort, and then towards the end of the episode they get into the moral implications of assigning blame based on physical characteristics.

It's maybe the best episode they've done.

My personal view is that our brain makes us do everything that we end up doing. It's the only view that I believe is compatible with modern science. If each of us is a collection of molecules banging together that somehow create consciousness, it's hard to see how something like the mind could stand outside that system and yet influence it. If that's true it only makes sense to me to punish people for crimes to the degree that it will prevent them from committing future crimes.

More to your point about testosterone, if it can be scientifically proven that testosterone having individuals have worse work performance in a given field, then it makes sense to discriminate against those persons in proportion to the contribution that testosterone makes to their performance. I personally don't believe that these effects are large enough in magnitude that they're the primary drivers of issues in banking and real estate and High Finance. I think in most cases societal pressures and culture have more influence on outcomes than the inherent human biology does.

På hvilken måte feilrepresenterer jeg spørsmålet ditt? Du sa klart og tydelig at hvis jeg baserte min ønskede løsning på dagens alkoholsystem, så er du i mot lisensordningen. 

Poenget mitt med dra inn alkoholpolitikken, er at vi har regler og ordninger for kontroll av utsalgssteder for alkohol, som tross alt fungerer ganske bra. Klart det koster litt penger, men det hadde vært temmelig trist å ikke kunne ta seg et glass vin på restaurant. Jeg mener det er vanskelig å forsvare at vi skal kunne ha en slik ordning for alkohol, men ikke for et mindre farlig rusmiddel.

Vinmonopolet er også en veldig spesialisert kjede, og jeg er ikke overbevist om at det vil være positivt for polet selv og også skulle måtte selge cannabis. For ikke snakke om at jeg mistenker at det ville være betydelig motstand innad i organisasjonen. Men dette er bare spekulasjon.

Så skal jeg også innrømme at jeg også har et ønske om at vi skal kunne ha mulighet for såkalte coffeshops, det vil ikke være mulig hvis Vinmonopolet skal få totalmonopol på cannabis.

Men for all del, bedre med statlig salg gjennom polet, enn å fortsette med den feilslåtte politikken så mange nordmenn blindt støtter.

I really can't believe Taya not being top 10. She's been champ for almost the entire calendar year in a fairly major promotion.

I also had Asuka pegged for top 10, but they may have cut things off before she got a tag title(which is why I assume Kairi isn't even on the list).

"news","t5_2qh3l","Hmmpf, let’s see about this “kid,” genius:

* Matt is his adopted kid; he asked Jerry and Dottie to adopt him at the age of 18, years after his supposed abuse (don’t get too hung up on this, Matt hadn’t yet made up his abuse at this point)

* After the allegations broke worldwide, Matt took his ex-wife to court to fight for the ability to take his own children to visit Jerry, his supposed abuser.

* Matt began as one of Jerry’s most ardent supporters. He said the accusers were lying for money (they’re all millionaires now BTW). He began the trial sitting in solidarity next to Dottie.

* Matt was overheard at trial saying “I could make a lot of money if I were up there”

* Matt flips mid trial, switching from Jerry’s supporter now to someone who suddenly remembered 100’s of instanced of oral sex. Convenient. 

* Matt receives an un-vetted settlement from Penn State, just like he said he could get away with. Now he’s a millionaire too.

I won’t say you’re that big of a jackass for believing Matt because you obviously haven’t bothered to learn even the basic facts here, so you’re just kinda blindly believing it and it’s more laziness than anything. But, come on, This is one of the biggest loads of bullshit ever",1572566551

A Republican...Also, ""The Republicans are completely wrong all of the time""...A Democrat.  This political story, that political story, always the same, 95% of the people complaining about the other side completely blinded to the fact that they are just as bad and one sided.  Read the comments to any political story,  If you really think your side is the only one that is always right YOU ARE ONE OF THE BRAINWASHED.  Both sides are corrupt, they are politicians, both sides have members who got involved with good intentions but are changed by the realities of keeping their seat and pressure from their senior party members.  Environment, abortion, right to be gay, right to bear arms and arm bears, all have been argued about since before I was born, never changes, the public just chooses sides and never changes, ""They are evil, we are the good guys!"".  But the other side thinks that of you too.  Might as well be sports teams, love mine hate yours.  I am old enough to have seen it go from a bad situation to certifiably insane and realized the party I used to somewhat stand behind had become something I could not recognize.  I was part of the problem.  Until a huge amount of us decide to step out of the , "" Grunt...we only good, they only bad..grunt grunt"" it will stay the same cesspool of inanity.  Want proof, look at the headline, Every Republican just ignored their oath, every Republican just said, no, every Democrat did, just depends on who writes it.    Both sides play exactly the same games!  The other side thinks they are as right as you think you are.  Step out of the matrix, see it,  choose not to participate.

&gt; Oct. 30, 2019, 7:05 p.m. ET.The Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was able to hide out in an unlikely part of Syria, the base of a rival group, because he was paying protection money to its members, according to receipts for the payments recovered by researchers.

&gt; Several ISIS members who saw Mr. al-Baghdadi in the last five years said that he had become so paranoid about the possibility of his inner circle being infiltrated that he mostly entrusted his security to a handful of close aides and members of his extended family.

&gt; In a news conference on Wednesday, the Pentagon said that six people, including four female Islamic State members, were killed in the raid on Mr. al-Baghdadi&amp;#039;s villa.

Leaving from the club permanently:

CAM Carazo 78 $10.3M release fee activated by Bologna 

CAM Kruger 73 $5.4M bought by Stade Brestois

With a few midfielders and reserve strike Bauer on loan the team is back to a minimalist roster, maximizing play time and development for the players.

And now what we’ve all been waiting for...THE KNOCKOUT ROUNDS ARE HERE. The boys devoured the group stage of the Euros with only one lost. Their group consisted of SC Braga, Dinamo Zagreb and Hearts. The sole lost cane to SC Braga in a 2-1 defeat but the team cruised to the next round with 15 points. The first challenge will be against Olympic Marseille. 

Production has been a bit slow from Navarro this season who was moved out to the wing, skipper Toberts has decided to move him back to the midfield for the time being and has given youth prospect Mok a chance to shine on the wing. If nothing is produced from these moves it is expected reserve striker Bauer will be called back from loan to help bolster the trident. 

The team is currently 4th in the league with 12 wins, 4 draws, and 4 losses amassing 49 points. Leading the league is FC Barcelona, followed by Real Madrid and Athletico Madrid. 

Manager Alexis Roberts was asked if the squad needed any transfers to help give the team the edge and this was her response: “Although we aren’t scoring as much as we would like we are still doing well and competing with the giants of the league. We have strong midfielders out on loan who can be called back if needed but for now I have faith that the men of the castle can get the job done. I would also like to address the rumors of me leaving the club. I will not be leaving this club anytime soon. We need to bring in some hardware and keep building on success. My dedication is to this team and solely this team. I will not be accepting any national jobs until we win a major competition.”

As always thank you for supporting the castle! We are at our first obstacle at the euros and we need to support the team as much as we can!",1572566554

"piercing","t5_2qolb","This has happened to me my whole life, and I’ve got 12 piercings now. My ears are the ones I notice it happens with the most often because those are the ones I will go without jewelry in for long stretches and then when I put something back in it itches and can be sore for up to a week. I’d say it’s mix of your piercing being stretched a little again, as well as maybe some sensitive skin issues. 

I’ve found the only way to make it so my skin doesn’t react is to wear something all the time. Titanium is best, but it won’t stop it from being irritated to begin with. It’s the fact that there’s something foreign stuck in there, not necessarily what that foreign object is made of. 

For me, I’ve never had it go longer than a week without seeing an improvement. I would say find some really light jewelry, not heavy studs or heavy anything, and give it 4-7 days. If it feels like it’s not getting better or is possibly getting worse around day 3 or even 4, then I would suggest taking it out and maybe talking to your doctor about metal sensitivities. There are some people that are allergic to nearly any type of metal. It’s rare, but possible. 

Good luck! I know what it’s like, and it’s sore, itchy, and just feels terrible, but I think you can pull through it. ( ◠‿◠ )",1572566555
"thalassophobia","t5_2xfs1","I was going to say Konijndijk  was getting mad over nothing but he is correct. Only took a a small search and I learned homies wasn’t some marketing gimmick created by a company.

A quote from the creater:
““It hurt, and I probably took it too seriously,” Gonzales told mitú about the criticism and backlash he received from releasing the toy line. Gonzales felt like his toys were unfairly criticized for perpetuating stereotypes. He says he was only trying to reflect the culture he grew up with: “I felt we were misunderstood as a culture. Not Mexican, not American, not Texan, not anything but California Chicanos into lowriding. Yes, gangs were part of the barrios we came from, but we were not all gangbangers. Our dress was our lifestyle, and our cars were also.”

Looking at it with a uncaring critical eye, you could say that style glorifies “gangsters and hoes” lifestyle maybe... but that wasn’t lil homies brands intent. So eh. 

I for one never homies history and that it was Chicano figures! Neat.

She asked if we had kids and I said not yet. So then the usual jokes of ""don't have kids! I'll give you mine!"" When I told her it was too late she tried to tell me that I'm not that old 😂

I literally had to point and say ""it's already in there"". So that's my one pregnancy story so far, and I think the only person I've told in person at this stage. That plan backfired so I'm back to realising I look like I ate a big breakfast.",1572566555

Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

Also last worlds, he wasn’t even an issue till semifinals where akali and irelia turned out to be OP, which Says more about which teams they scrimmed rather than his actual ability as a player.

hi there! please bear with me i’m on mobile-

my boyfriend (21M) and i (20F) have been together a year. he’s very reclusive and we spend all our time together, and i’ve never suspected him of any infidelity except for today. 

although he’s never given me a reason to think so, today i was folding his laundry for him when i stumbled across a pair of panties that weren’t mine. he lives with three other guys, all with their own gals. i asked every guy/gal if the panties were theirs/their partners, and everybody except one girl said no. needless to say, i got antsy as fuck. every single one of my exes has cheated on me, so i asked him how he could explain it. i went through his phone with him and he explained the context of each snapchat conversation he had with a girl. i even asked his roommates if he had any girls over or anything like that, and they said they haven’t seen him with anybody. they said he was either studying or with me. he swore up and down he had no idea who they belonged to, but i had to leave for work in the midst of the emotional exchange. 

the last girl finally responded while i was at work, saying they weren’t hers. i lost my shit. i asked him why he lied to me, how he could do this, and to give me something concrete for his case. he still swore he had no idea where they came from. 

i had to spend some time away from my phone to focus on my work, and during that time, i was considering assuming he was innocent, considering how good he is to me and how out of the blue it would be, but then again, i’m paranoid. 

when i got back to my phone, one of the other guys confirmed with his gf that they were hers, so a previous “no” became a “yes”. i’ve shut down after feeling so much. my boyfriend is angry at me because i didn’t trust him and believe in his character, his word, or his friends words. i know my trust issues are still unresolved, but i’m just so unsure if i was justified in my reaction. AITA?

&gt; Oct. 30, 2019, 7:05 p.m. ET.The Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was able to hide out in an unlikely part of Syria, the base of a rival group, because he was paying protection money to its members, according to receipts for the payments recovered by researchers.

&gt; Several ISIS members who saw Mr. al-Baghdadi in the last five years said that he had become so paranoid about the possibility of his inner circle being infiltrated that he mostly entrusted his security to a handful of close aides and members of his extended family.

&gt; In a news conference on Wednesday, the Pentagon said that six people, including four female Islamic State members, were killed in the raid on Mr. al-Baghdadi&amp;#039;s villa.

"TheBlackList","t5_2whmr","*""This Show Has Some Seriously Sneaky Writing...""*

If by ""sneaky"" you mean duplicitous, then yes. Because that's what it is. The entirety of the narrative (as we've often been told) is laboriously anchored by this question of ""Who is Red?"". Which is to say, they believe once his identity is revealed, then....well, nobody exactly knows. And that's the whole point. The creators of this show have thrown all-in that this reveal of Red's ""identity"" is the culmination of why and how everything you've been watching for 7 years (and counting) will somehow systematically align, and fall into an astonishing harmony. Think they've built this up a wee bit much????

Not only have the powers that be insisted on keeping Red's ""identity"" a shell game of audience guessing (as if the audience is tabulating scorecards at home to try to follow all of this), but within the narrative itself, Red is trying to prevent disclosure of his ""identity"". But keep its disclosure from...whom?? Liz. That's the mind boggling thing about all of this. He's been trying to keep this from her. So the obvious question is: why? What is so catastrophic, detrimental, disadvantageous to Red if Liz knows who he is?? That's what they've setup. And we know the level of desperation he had: acute. In Season 5, Red had Garvey at gunpoint in the bar threatening to blow his head off if he uttered a single word about who he *wasn't* to Liz. In Season 6, the desperation reached peak again when Red tells Dembe Liz ""...knows I was once someone else"". Which is why he suspends Dembe's work to secure his immunity agreement (the very thing keeping him alive; once fellow crooks find out Red's a snicth for the Fed's, he's toast). He diverts Dembe to grab Marguerite Renard before Liz finds her, and has Dembe ""disappear"" her , for good. So Red's gone to great lengths to hide all of this from Liz. So...why?

Let's play it out. Red is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. And because he's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, this is *why* Liz could never know who he was, and its why he both killed and hid people to keep this from her. Now that Liz knows (which is presumably the ""end"" of all this nonsense), the world is ..... \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Fill in these blanks. I submit there is nothing - I repeat, nothing - that can fill in these blanks that warrants everything they've built up as these blanks having a profoundness that will transcend the whole series. Who he is remains only the lesser half of this formula. What they've setup is *her knowledge of his identity* is the one thing that is so critical that he was killing and sequestering people to ensure its secrecy. There isn't anything you can put into these blanks that will justify all of the duplicitous, shell game of a narrative they've been committed to writing form the start. Their ""reveal"" will be the sincerest dud.",1572566558

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Mm... I was a bedwetter, and had an accident or two at 12. No abuse. It happened to me in a movie theatre once because I was next to a boy I liked and didn’t want to get up to go to the bathroom and then all of a sudden it was too late.

I 100% would have done this out of paralyzing shame. Just pretend it didn’t happen, don’t say anything, just be normal, leave the situation. Changing draws attention. Just pretend it didn’t happen... that’s what I did that movie theatre day.

"Infidelity","t5_2raxb","Thanks for your support and understanding.  No, I am not super-human.  In fact, I would say that for two years after I was not human at all.  I feel like I basically didn't exist.  I was not a person.  My personhood was completely erased by the two people who were closest to me.  I felt exposed, naked, unprotected, violated, betrayed, crushed, assassinated, exterminated.  The gaslighting made me question my sanity, my decency as a person (what kind of terrible person was I to think these horrible things about my best friend and husband?), my reality.  Up was down and down was up.  

By coincidence, all of this happened as our youngest children (5 children in the group were graduating high school) graduated and went on to college.  So, the fact that there were a couple of years that our ""group"" didn't have any get togethers was lamented by everyone but seen as a natural outcome of the kids leaving the nest.  I knew otherwise, and so did she.  She is the center of the social group, and she calls the shots.  Everyone fears her and does what they can to please her.  In private and one on one, though, she was giving another story of how she was being victimized by me and how gracious she was to forgive me.  It has affected my closest friendships, and there is nothing I can do to change the perception unless I out the affair. 
It would affect 5 families, all of whom feel that we are extended family.    The kids are all like our nieces and nephews, and these are lifelong relationships since they were all in the crib.  Saving myself would sink everyone else.  

But no, I will never be the same person.  I was always the most trusting and empathetic person (which I now know is how I was duped in the first place) and now I am more guarded and don't feel I can trust anyone but my sisters. The way I got through the two years after (it has been 6 now) was that I exercised my brains out every day, and for that 45 minutes had the only relief in the day from panic attacks and nausea.  (I had no idea that in a crowded gym where I chose a corner stair machine, that strangers were watching me. A policeman stopped me in the mall and asked if I go to that particular gym- then told me to be careful or I will have a heart attack the way I go at it. Most days I was suppressing sobs while pushing my legs and lungs to their limits, and almost wishing my heart would pop.)  Leaving the gym every day, I felt I had to hold it together for my H, who was likely to take his own life if he fully understood what I was going through.  

It took those couple of years of curling up in the fetal position and wanting to cease existence (and a lot of therapy) to come out somewhat sane. Sometimes, there is just nothing to be gained by telling the story, and we have to let go of the narrative and try to respect ourselves for being honest and truthful when others are not. But it has killed the person that I was. . . .
Thank you again for asking. . . .",1572566562

"television","t5_2qh6e","&gt; No. The skin colour can not be ""whatever the fuck they want it to be"" because this is an adaptation of book and it must stay true to it.

No, it mustn't. It can be as faithful or as irreverent to the source material as its creators want to be. They *certainly* don't answer to the tiny fraction of bigoted pricks on the internet who complain about the skin color of fantasy characters.

In this case, the creators of the show are obviously going out of their way to respect the source material in nearly all ways except this one - and its an aspect of the show that doesn't affect the actual story in any way, so there's literally no reason to complain about it other than as a cowardly outlet for your broken, casual racism.

&gt; Witcher books takes place in a medieval Poland

No, they don't. They take place in a fantasy world with a handful of Polish-inspired elements, along with elements of British Arthurian legend, Germanic folk stories, and Scandinavian mythology.

&gt; where there everyone are white.

Not in the TV series.

&gt; I didn't see anyone complain that there's not a single white person in Wakanda.

Actually, I've seen literally dozens of racist morons complaining that there are no white people in Wakanda because they think it's some kind of clever retort to diverse casting. What they're really doing - much like you are right now - is broadcasting to the rest of the world that they don't understand the difference between a story that is fundamentally about what would happen if an isolated ancient African people in a fictionalized *real world Africa* developed a technologically advanced civilization independently of the rest of the world, and a completely fictional universe made up of a mish-mash of quasi-European mythologies where a person's skin color doesn't need to play any kind of role in the story at all.

Kil'jaeden has sworn that the Burning Legion will continue to attack Azeroth until it is conquered, no matter how many millenia it make take. The wizards of Dalaran have finally located his lair in the Twisting Nether, the world of Argus. They have generated a one-way portal to a random spot just outside the Burning Legion's capital fortress. An army of adventurers will be required to assault this citadel. Those who die will be resurrected back on Azeroth, but it may take several minutes for their souls to return to their bodies from across the Twisting Nether.

Once adventurers fight their way to Kil'jaeden, he starts triggering huge effects that destablize the fortress itself. Huge gouts of flame explode from furnaces, filling entire rooms. Some areas simply explode, throwing players into other parts of the fortress. Eventually the portal to Argus closes because of the destablization, and the remaining players have to try to complete the fight without reinforcements as the fortress crumbles around them.

Finally, if enough damage is done to Kil'Jaeden, he flees by disintegrating into fel energy, leaving behind fragments of his armor, one for each player who survives the encounter, which takes the form of a legendary trinket that they can equip. It will take weeks, but he will eventually reform himself and rebuild his fortress, stronger than before. Or just have him permanently die. That can work too.",1572566565

&gt; Oct. 31 - North Korea&amp;#039;s all-women&amp;#039;s Moranbong Band is expected to launch a nationwide tour in China, and the event could coincide with a summit between Kim Jong Un and China&amp;#039;s Xi Jinping, according to a South Korean press report.

&gt; Moranbong Band is set to begin its tour in the Chinese capital upon the invitation of the China International Cultural Communication Center in cooperation with a cultural group in Guangzhou.

&gt; Jun Hee-kyung of the Liberty Korea Party, the main opposition, said the tests show the true face of North Korea and cautioned President Moon Jae-in, according to the report.

No, your own comments called your character and intelligence into question. I just pointed that out to you and gave you a chance to clarify.  

&gt; See this? This is absurd. 

Is it? I thought the same when I saw you calling for the destruction of historical art. Can you explain the difference to me? You don't like the subjects depicted in the statues, you don't like that some of them were likely commissioned by racists. How is that substantially different from burning books because you don't like what's written in them, or destroying artifacts because they were made by people who with whom you're ideologically opposed?

&gt; These are the people saying that I'M the problem for correctly pointing out that confederate apologists are racist dipshits.

I think the problem is more that you're far too quick to assume that people *are* confederate apologists. (hint: I am not a confederate apologist or a racist). I don't doubt that many racist dipshits are in fact confederate apologists, but you should be much more careful about pointing that finger. You're so eager to find apologists so that you can cry ""racist!"" that you can't even entertain the idea that a person might disagree with you for any other reason, and you're instantly dismissive of any and all nuance in what is actually an extremely complex topic.",1572566566

The king of Sector One has been murdered in his sleep, and the other sectors wait in anticipation to see where the shadowy assassin will strike next. Elsewhere, Sector Six, long thought to have been destroyed in the Great War, has been rediscovered, and the inhabitants of the island are locked in a psychological battle for their very sovereignty as a nation. A war is brewing, and, as the storm clouds roll in, ten strangers from all corners of the known world will be drawn together in a quest to both determine the truth and prevent the end of the world as they know it. Their journeys will take them from lush jungles and snow capped mountains to the mechanical underbellies of industrial cities, and, perhaps, into the darkest, most twisted recesses of their own warped psychosis.

The novel is heavily dialogue based, with the main focus surrounding character and world building.

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I too have my ""dream"" job, i.e. the one I went to school for.  It's not what I thought it would be, but nothing ever is.

I've fought depression on and off for years.  I had some absolute shit jobs before I landed this one, so I try to be grateful for what I have, knowing it could be so much worse.

I came to the conclusion long ago that I don't hate the job.  It's not my boss's fault.  He's a great boss and an all-around good guy.  I just hate working because I'm not equipped emotionally to support myself.  I have mental health issues that oh, guess what, work exacerbates every fucking day.  But I live alone.  I have to support myself.  And my income is severely limited by the amount of stress I can physically and mentally handle.

As long as I have to support myself, there's no escape from this.

It took years, but I've pretty much just resigned myself to it.  It's the only advice I have.  I live in a shell.  I've stopped caring about the future, about traveling, owning things that aren't half-broken hand-me-down shit, about saving money for retirement.  For a while I tried to motivate myself by telling myself I'd save money to buy something cool I wanted.  Then I looked at the cost of what I wanted and remembered how much I make a month and realized it's never fucking going to happen.

Resigning yourself is all you can really do.  Don't plan for the future.  Don't hope for anything better.  It only ends with disappointment.  I'm sorry I don't have much better advice.",1572566566

Any face fillers won’t look that great when not photoshopped, like you can see her cheek fillers, lip fillers and Botox, giving that frozen look. She’s gained some weight too. 

She is 45 aging is normal, but it’s also not the best photo, and I don’t like her makeup. The cool toned icy blue eye shadow isn’t flattering on her warmer skin tone. The lip color washes her out, and the smoked out eyeliner under her eye makes her look tired. And the makeup trends are outdated too, she needs a better makeup stylist. Her hair color is too dark, she looks better with her natural medium brown hair color.

This post deriding the unempathetic boss who would rather let an employee starve than to give away free food doesn't exist. Capitalism is this flawless perfect system that hasn't destroyed the environment. Nor led to any wars or economic injustices. The Banana republic wars never happened, and no coup in Latin America was never waged to usurp a democratically elected official for a dictator who will bend to the will of America and it's financial interests. 

You wanna put up quotes and pretend that's an argument?

[&gt;In the footnotes to chapter 6 of Chomsky’s Understanding Power are these illuminating remarks: “\[Thomas\] Jefferson did not support capitalism; he supported independent production… The fundamental Jeffersonian proposition is that ‘widespread poverty and concentrated wealth cannot exist side by side in a democracy.’]

My thought is, a few buds from a different plant got mixed in, were obviously not tested, and had a much higher thc percentage than the tested sample. Therefore the test results are accurate for that tiny sample that was tested, but not the rest of the harvest. Somebody please correct me if i'm wrong, but this would make sense why some people get high off of hemp. The tests arent accurate for a grow the size that most farms have, without re testing multiple times with different plants, so everybody is actually getting different amounts of cannabinoids in their flower, and the test results mean virtually nothing other than a single bud from that harvest tested at the levels advertised.",1572566569

B2) **Do not delete this submission** (or ANY submission past or present), for any reason, or any of your comments as it will result in a ban.  If your request is fulfilled or you **no longer need the money** please do one or a combination of A) edit your post to reflect the change, B) flair your post as 'complete' (the flair button is under the body text of the post), and/or C) make a comment that it's no longer needed.

B3) **Wait 24 hours** from this post to make another unless this post or the next is prearranged with a particular lender

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. B) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately C) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if dankT3 has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=dankT3&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L4) Check dankT3's [**Spam History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), [**RedditMetis profile**](https://www.redditmetis.com/user/dankT3), or [**Atomiks Analyzer Profile**](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#dankT3), or [Redetective profile](https://www.redective.com/) [**!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gcdeletes+gcremoves+gcmirror+gcarchive+gcalerts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

You have a focal point, with directional lines moving towards the door, it might benefit adding some glowing effect (by softening the edge between the doorway and the light through gradation) on the rest of the surrounding area since we cannot see past the threshold so the intensity of the light must be quite high. The yellow in the lower half is nice, you might want to consider building up the paint, although from this vantage point, I guess we cannot see the the texture of the painting that might already be there.

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","&gt; Well yeah, I never said it was a quote -- YOU DID.  I just used that word since you did.  

When you put a saying in quotes, it’s a quote. 

&gt; It's just a saying that may or may not have some truth to it in certain contexts.

You seem to still be missing the point. Call it a “saying” or whatever you like, it’s meaningless unless you put some value behind it. You put down a saying and then acted as if the saying alone lend credit to the claim the saying makes. It’s nonsense. 

&gt; If you are claiming that the idea that Christianity may be wrong is not uncomfortable, then you are flat out lying to yourself. 

The idea that Christianity may be wrong has not crossed my mind. There is certainly nothing about this particular exchange which I could imagine, in my wildest imagination, that anyone would find challenging. 

I’m confused about how you could even come up with the idea that you were summoning those kinds of thoughts for anyone, much less me in particular. 

Do you have me confused with someone else? Maybe you should double check. 

&gt; Don't assume that you are 100% of my audience when I'm responding to your comments.  

I’m curious. Who do you think is reading this now?

&gt; There are many Christians on here who are starting to notice how horrific the God of the Bible is and how silly some of the scriptural claims truly are.

Oh? These were people who were confused Christian believers before, but now that you’ve shown them the truth they are coming around to your opinion? 

If you say so, I guess? Your text feels a little delusional to be honest. 

&gt; Some of those people are willing to begin making objective and honest assessments ...

I know what you mean. I’m always encouraged when I talk to atheists who honestly assess their lives in the face of the meaninglessness their claimed worldview actually espouses in contrast to what they really think. 

&gt; ... to potentially break free of the indoctrination even if you're not quite ready.

Whatever you need to tell yourself.

Andrew Coyne: [Conservative climate change 'plan' is really more of a prop](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-conservative-climate-change-plan-is-really-more-of-a-prop).

Katharine Hayhoe and Andrew Leach: [The best and worst federal party climate plans, graded](https://www.macleans.ca/society/environment/the-best-and-worst-federal-party-climate-plans-graded/).

Mark Jaccard: [Emissions will rise under Conservative climate plan](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/august-2019/emissions-will-rise-under-conservative-climate-plan/). A reversion to information and subsidies, which are largely ineffective.

"k12sysadmin","t5_2wnyn","Clever integrates with Powerschool by assigning it a username and password that has DDE access (direct database export). It either uses just web/http requests, or API calls to export the database fields it needs. Clever actually ""pulls"" from Powerschool. The powerschool admin can also use just csv exports to send fields, but it gets complicated sending roster and class info that way. 


When they say ""managed connections"" they just mean setting up an sftp destination. It's in a section in Powerschool called ""Remote Connection Manager""


Data Export Manager is just the area where you build your exports and schedule them.


The problem you're likely having is that Powerschool migrated parent and guardian contact data from a few limited standard student fields to a complex extensible system. The data now exists across multiple relational tables, as you can have 3 moms, 2 dads, but your aunt and nephew have custody of you, but Grandpa and Grandma can pick you up, etc. It's way more powerful for tracking student contacts, but way more complicated to pull from. So instead of pulling the ""Guardian"" field, you now pull from a function: `""^(*contact_info;Flags=Lives-With;Max-Pers=1;cat=dem;val=Firstname,Lastname;Value-Delim=space;)""`

I don't know if this is a company wide policy however and the reputation of that knowledge is slowly getting around so many folks within the company are trying to acknowledge and change that.

A few of the people on my team will convert to FTE's so I'd say it's definitely a possibility for many. Just have to decide how much risk you're willing to assume.

"dating","t5_2qhb1","Building social circles is like a whole different beast than finding a partner. Essentially I present you tips from my student life:

Find some regular events or sports clubs based on what you think might be interesting to you. Just pick anything you wanted to try no matter how dumb it is and basically show up there. The first rule is to just go there and talk to as many people as you can and just see if you have anything in common. The second rule is to allow yourself to leave whenever you want, because fuck it you're a free person. Maybe you just don't vibe with the people there and you have nothing in common or you just decided to pick some sort of tennis club and you realize you think tennis is lame. Simply leave and find something else, don't get too bummed out about it. Better to leave than do something you don't like.

So yeah. If you do that there's a decent chance you'll eventually meet some dude that you'll want to bang or at least hang out with. Some times men are completely retarded and oblivious. I think it's ok to be doing the asking out if you really hit it off with someone.

It worked out well for me a few times. Some times I made shit awkward by flirting with women in a relationship (it's not like I'm a damn mind reader). A few times I made it even worse by continuing to do it, because apparently I can be an asshole. So if you're ever going to get overconfident and you're the persistent type...well you might have to leave a few activities and find new ones...so don't get too attached to them.

I tried online recently as well mainly because my day job + side job eat away 90h/week. It sucks, it's awkward and people only write when they're at work taking their morning shit. Hell you don't even know if you're attracted to that person, because you could be looking at an older picture or you could miss out on someone you'd find attractive, because they suck at taking pictures.",1572566574

He was the first candidate to propose eliminating the AUMF, and the only one to call for a sunset provision on all authorizations of military force. He was the first candidate to propose making Israeli aid conditional on their willingness to cooperate in the West Bank

3. What policy makes him a “Republican”?
- He’s in favor of eliminating the electoral college. 
- He wants to change the constitution to reform the supreme court’s nomination process. 
- He wants to amend the competition to protect abortion rights. 
- He wants to amend the constitonal to overturn citizens united. 
- He wants to decriminalize all drugs. 
- He wants to ban private prisons. 
- He wants to pass a new voting rights act. 
- He wants to use the pentagon budget to combat climate disruption.

&gt;Yep and the people who will pay more are those who can afford it. 

Maybe, maybe not. Not everyone with a high salary can afford to pay more, because cost of living varies hugely in this country. And some people who get all of their premiums covered currently wouldn't necessarily have to have a high salary to pay more. 


&gt;So you understand when I say that clamoring about taxes going up is a disingenuous and confusing. 

To a point. It's also disingenuous to claim everyone will end up saving money, or that it's okay because the only people who will pay more can afford it.

Edit 2 - incase people think if naruto just dumps his metal hes fine, Magneto can still manipulate energy blasts that go through mountains - https://m.imgur.com/3bNq20N. Pretty sure he can manipulate electric also but thats more modern not classic. He can also amp himself by tapping into earths magnetic fields https://i.imgur.com/kfKdxpw.jpg. he can also just zoom the fuck away or throw earth around as it usually has metal in - https://m.imgur.com/a/HDbJV. He can also just straight send you into space - https://i.imgur.com/0jZrhkg.jpg. 

People forget that magneto does not control metal, his powers go far more than that to the point he can magnetize things that are non magnetic - https://i.imgur.com/0EHVhW9.jpg.

Most fucked up is his blood control he shows where he just gives naruto a stroke, i dont know how you stop this and plot makes it so he doesnt always just do it - https://i.imgur.com/VMnzUV4.jpg. also amnesia and paralasis - https://m.imgur.com/a/GUeX4",1572566579

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

Outside of math and computer related studies, it doesn't especially matter which ""electives"" you take, as long as you take something. So it depends a lot on what options are available to you. If access to things like biology laboratories is a problem, physics is an ""advanced science"" that can be studied at the high school level without any complicated equipment or resources. Plus, for physics in particular, it helps to be good at math!

Or, just do anything else you can think of that sounds interesting. If you want to go to a 4-year college for a degree in computer science, they'll probably want math, english (basically writing), and something in the broad categories of ""science"", ""art"", and ""social studies"". So, find some interesting things that fit into those. Start playing the trombone. Study the history of south america in the 1700s. Learn macroeconomics.

*****
&gt; The majority of private fire crews work for insurance companies like Chubb, USAA and Safeco, which often provide fire mitigation services to their policyholders in high-risk fire areas without extra charge.

&gt; Armed with pool pumps and fire hoses, residents and Covered 6 security guards held the fire at bay long enough for Cal Fire air tankers to arrive that evening and drop pink fire retardant around the edge of the city.

&gt; Mr. Freedland, who served in an emergency command center at Hidden Hills City Hall as the fire raged, said that about 30 residents and city security guards ignored mandatory evacuation orders and stayed behind to protect the homes in the fire&amp;#039;s path.

"apexlegends","t5_rgzzt","Some games (MW2, for instance) had certain game modes that either disabled party chat or wouldn't let you 'ready up' if you were in a party, I used to play a lot of hardcore headquarters in that game and trust me, when you got 2-5 people together in one lobby, all friends, and had to play with 1 random it was annoying as hell to be in gamechat with the guy who was playing music, cooking Thanksgiving dinner, and talking to 10 different people all at once but since HC Headquarters didn't let you go into party chat you had to mute him and hope he never said anything useful.

So I would think it's definitely a possibility for respawn to force disable party chat from ranked, it would be neat for them to allow full premades to still be in a party though, because the gap when going to and from a lobby sucks when someone is mid sentence and they get cut off, but if that's too difficult then I'd rather hsve no party's in ranked",1572566584

Warren's promise specifically was breaking up big tech, which is Facebook and Google et cetra but neither her nor Sanders will break up ISPs like AT&amp;T because of just how recently this was tried with the result being eventually similarly consolidating regional monopolies with slower speeds that bear the same problems.

B1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Borrower FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/borrowers)

B2) **Do not delete this submission** (or ANY submission past or present), for any reason, or any of your comments as it will result in a ban.  If your request is fulfilled or you **no longer need the money** please do one or a combination of A) edit your post to reflect the change, B) flair your post as 'complete' (the flair button is under the body text of the post), and/or C) make a comment that it's no longer needed.

B3) **Wait 24 hours** from this post to make another unless this post or the next is prearranged with a particular lender

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. B) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately C) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

B6) **If you have any questions or concerns whatsoever**, feel free to ask moderators by clicking **[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fborrow)**

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if dankT3 has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=dankT3&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L4) Check dankT3's [**Spam History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), [**RedditMetis profile**](https://www.redditmetis.com/user/dankT3), or [**Atomiks Analyzer Profile**](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#dankT3), or [Redetective profile](https://www.redective.com/) [**!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gcdeletes+gcremoves+gcmirror+gcarchive+gcalerts/search?q=dankT3&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","Is it wrong to refer to something that something that usually represents men as manly? Like If I see a car that has a build like a muscle car and has huge horse power, I might say that car is “muscle car(y)”, even if some sports cars might have more horsepower and look similar. If i see a muscle car that that handles really well, I can say that that muscle car is “sports car(y)”, because it acts like most sports cars.

Following that logic, why it is wrong to say that a woman is benching more than a strongman is doing something “manly”, or why is it wrong to say a man who is psychoanalyzing someone (something women are on average better at) is doing something womanly.

Im not saying manly or womanly are good/bad things, some women might enjoy doing manly things and some men might enjoy doing womanly things, and there is nothing wrong with that.

 Referring to something a group does well as “that group(y)” is logically correct.",1572566590

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) disse nesta quinta-feira (31) que determinou o cancelamento de todas as [assinaturas da **Folha**](https://secure.folha.com.br/folha) no governo federal. Em tom de ameaça, o presidente também disse que os anunciantes do jornal ""devem prestar atenção"".

 ""Determinei que todo o governo federal rescinda e cancele a assinatura da **Folha de ****S.Paulo**. A ordem que eu dei [é que] nenhum órgão do meu governo vai receber o jornal **Folha de ****S.Paulo** aqui em Brasília. Está determinado. É o que eu posso fazer, mas nada além disso"", disse, em entrevista à TV Bandeirantes.

 ""Espero que não me acusem de censura. Está certo? Quem quiser comprar a **Folha de ****S.Paulo**, ninguém vai ser punido, o assessor dele vai lá na banca e compra lá e se divirta. Eu não quero mais saber da **Folha de ****S.Paulo**, que envenena o meu governo a leitura da **Folha de ****S.Paulo**.""

  Questionado pelo apresentador José Luiz Datena se seria uma forma de censura, o presidente respondeu: ""Não é uma forma de censura, nada"".

 Mais tarde, em live nas redes sociais, Bolsonaro voltou ao tema e ameaçou anunciantes do jornal.

 ""Não vamos mais gastar dinheiro com esse tipo de jornal. E quem anuncia na **Folha de ****S.Paulo** presta atenção, está certo?"", disse.

 “Se confirmada, a decisão de Bolsonaro configura uma violação dos princípios constitucionais da moralidade e da impessoalidade na administração pública”, afirma Luiz Francisco Carvalho Filho, advogado da **Folha**.

 ""Trata-se de atitude típica de governos totalitários. Chávez e Maduro, por irônica que seja a comparação, fizeram exatamente a mesma coisa com a imprensa na Venezuela. Os veículos todos são ameaçados, não apenas a **Folha**"", diz Taís Gasparian, também advogada do jornal.

 Em nota, a **Folha** afirmou que “lamenta mais uma atitude abertamente discriminatória do presidente da República contra o jornal e vai continuar fazendo, em relação a seu governo, o jornalismo crítico e apartidário que a caracteriza e que praticou em relação a todos os outros governos”.

 Antes de anunciar o cancelamento das assinaturas, Bolsonaro citou um [café da manhã que teve com jornalistas da **Folha**](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/bolsonaro-ve-babaquice-da-pf-e-quer-arejada-na-direcao-da-policia.shtml) no Palácio da Alvorada, em 3 de setembro.

 [Participaram desse café](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/bolsonaro-ve-babaquice-da-pf-e-quer-arejada-na-direcao-da-policia.shtml), além de Bolsonaro, o ministro da Secretaria de Governo, Luiz Eduardo Ramos, o chefe da Secom (Secretaria de Comunicação) da Presidência, Fábio Wajngarten, e o deputado Marco Feliciano (Podemos-SP). O encontro ocorreu das 7h40 às 9h10.

 Durante a conversa, o presidente autorizou que todo o teor da conversa fosse publicado, com exceção dos palavrões ditos por ele [durante o café da manhã](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/bolsonaro-ve-babaquice-da-pf-e-quer-arejada-na-direcao-da-policia.shtml), o que foi respeitado pela **Folha**.

 À TV Bandeirantes nesta quinta-feira, porém, Bolsonaro deu uma declaração falsa ao dizer que o jornal publicou palavrões na entrevista e que o conteúdo das declarações foi todo distorcido —reclamação que ele não havia feito quando a reportagem foi publicada.

 ""Recebi a **Folha** uma questão de uns 45, 50 dias atrás. Conversei com eles numa boa e, no dia seguinte, foi um festival de desinformação. Eu até fui criticado por assessores meus, e com razão. Por que falou com a **Folha**? Eu fui tentar dar uma chance pra eles.""

 ""Não saiu nada do que eu falei. Só saiu desinformação. E algumas palavras que eu usei ali e falei: 'Isso aqui é palavrão, segura a onda, escorreguei'. Saiu palavrão [na entrevista], saiu tudo lá. Não dá pra gente confiar, por exemplo, na **Folha de ****S.Paulo**.""

 O ataque desta quinta-feira não é o primeiro de Bolsonaro à **Folha**. Em outubro do ano passado, em [entrevista ao Jornal Nacional](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/esse-jornal-se-acabou-diz-bolsonaro-ao-jornal-nacional-sobre-a-folha.shtml), o então presidente eleito afirmou que “por si só, esse jornal se acabou”.

 “Não quero que [a **Folha**] acabe. Mas, no que depender de mim, imprensa que se comportar dessa maneira indigna não terá recursos do governo federal”. O presidente eleito, depois, completou: “Por si só esse jornal se acabou”.

 Uma semana antes do segundo turno da eleição de 2018, no dia 21 de outubro, Bolsonaro afirmou que ""a **Folha de ****S.Paulo** é a maior fake news do Brasil"". A declaração, feita em vídeo ao vivo exibido em telões na avenida Paulista, foi recebida com gritos de apoio dos eleitores do então candidato.

 Na semana passada, o presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, ordenou que as agências federais do país [cancelassem as assinaturas dos jornais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/10/trump-manda-agencias-federais-cortar-assinaturas-de-new-york-times-e-washington-post.shtml)) The New York Times e The Washington Post por discordar da cobertura que as duas publicações fazem de seu governo.

 A seguir, a nota da **Folha** sobre as declarações do presidente:

? That was just an example. I have no intention of giving GameFreak money for Sw/Sh.

&gt;I actually do support the whole push back against Netflix thing because I support artists and their visions

Congratulations, you are just as misinformed as the people angry at Netflix. Apparently you forgot that you can buy/rent movies on YouTube and modify playback speed there. So grats on either being ignorant or hypocritical. ""Netflix why won't you respect the wishes of creators???? YouTube you've done it for years but who cares that you're doing it? You're not Netflix!!!! Even though it's the same idea!""

Also hoo boy, if you want to go down that path. I don't see how giving people the OPTION to fast-forward or slow down a movie if they so wish, is WORSE than creators selling their movies to fucking TV channels. Nothing kills a chase scene or dramatic moment more than a fade to black and an ad break, and in some cases movies can be dramatically cut down to fit more ads in. Related Pokemon example, I learned that the TV version of the Diancie movie cut it down to AN HOUR. As in it fits in a 60-minute timeslot. ***The movie is an hour and thirty-eight minutes***! And you think Netflix (Apparently JUST Netflix too, just like those fuckwit creators who ignored YouTube and possibly other platforms) is the most significant threat to artists and their visions?

Let's also not forget that it's entirely possible to fuck with the ""intended vision"" in ANY medium. I can skip to the end of a book if I want. I can skip episodes and seasons and parts of shows, or even entire MOVIES in a series, on Netflix or any other streaming site. Even rentals like Redbox! If I have a DVD or Blu-Ray I can also skip forward or rewind back.

I fail to see the distinction. In both cases, the consumer is being given the ability to mess up their experience. But you only care about the one case, Netflix. It would be 100% feasible to tell DVD/Blu-Ray player manufacturers ""Hey don't include a skip button"". And no I'm not being facetious here, if you really give that much of a fuck about ""supporting artists and their visions"" you should be pushing for something bigger. Going up against Netflix isn't attacking the heart of the problem, that those who create and maintain distribution methods for media apparently show disrespect or disdain for it.

I recognize that's off-topic but I am 100% serious. If you want to pick that hill to die on, you should commit. If I as a consumer am not allowed to determine if I want to speed up or slow down the movie (Which really makes no sense given that I can just skip ahead using the navigation bar anyway so it's just an extraneous addition that only adds and doesn't take away), it should be something that applies EVERYWHERE. Not just to one streaming service.",1572566594

Youll learn quickly how many guys are absolute dogs and havent matured past high school when you ask the women for their online dating horror stories as a fun first date question

If youre a decent guy youll do fine.  I was shocked to see how fast things go. I became single again at 37 and found out that sex was the norm by the third date. 

I was okay with that.  

It starts online with a polite and fairly short and informative first message.  Then if you get her number youre texting constantly for a few days and you get that first date.  The first half hour of the first date will tell you everything.  Chemistry is pretty instantly obvious.  I can banter like a champ so if she was in any way outgoing we clicked.  But i always could tell from the texting anyway.  And finally. If you get a second date youre on your way. 

Expect to be suprised at pics vs reality for some.  Its frustrating but part of the process

The whole thing just gets easier and easier to spot things that are dealbreakers and weed out those that wont work out.

We need to stop seeing money as evil and understand it is a tool. I believe in capitalism because when a free market functions correctly it means we decide what we find valuable and allows niche markets to exist. Money puts power in our hands. 
If you don't like selling your time for those wages, find a new job, start a business, learn new skills.
The free market means that if a company is really treating their employees that badly, another company can steal them by paying more.

I’m not sure if I’m being serious or facetious here , probably a bit of both ..

But there’s two of them.

Could have one do the the offensive line and one do the defensive line , only potentially an issue on the last tackle (do touch judges generally drop back with the wingers on the last to rule on kicks for touch?)..

I’m trying to think back to my junior Footy , from memory , I think the referees and touchies used to work it out as they went .

Though it was more often the touch judges marking the ten and the referee used to switch , sometimes they’d be at the ruck and sometimes back with the defence (guess it depended on what they felt they needed to pay more attention to at different points of the game) ..

My point I guess was it was at the referees and touchies discretion 20 years ago.. This probably wouldn’t fly now , the NRL seems to want to standardise everything nowadays , but I’m sure the referees coaches / bosses / trainers etc could decide what worked best for everyone and train them all to do whatever is decided upon as the standard...

Whether that be one touchie with the defence, one with the attack and the ref floats . Or both touchies with the attack and the ref with the defence , or vice versa ...",1572566594

"space","t5_2qh87","Thanks for correcting me. I was wrong about the distinction between electrons and baryons.

Ok, so could you help me correct my understanding:

1. A regular star is in a plasma phase where the majority of atoms are charged. There is a gas of charged particles and free electrons. They behave according to the laws of magnetohydrodynamics. This star has not collapsed because of electron degeneracy pressure
2. As a star gets older and colder, there are not enough states to satisfy the Pauli Exclusion principle.  Electron Degeneracy Pressure is based on the pauli exclusion principle. After electron degeneracy pressure is not enough to keep the electrons away from the charged ions, they will combine to form a sea of neutrons, not held together by the Strong Force, but through gravity
3. This sea of neutrons still abides by the pauli exclusion priniciple, and is held apart by neutron degeneracy pressure.

My mistake must have been to confuse the pauli exclusion principle with electron degeneracy pressure?",1572566595
"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","No man you are not being dramatic at all. I get it completely. Theres been days where just sitting on the couch across from my SO has been nauseating because the smell is so bad. Or being in bed and needing to turn away from him because the smell is making me feel sick. 

On top of that, you genuinely could get sick from kissing him with his bad mouth hygiene. Not as bad as he could get from neglecting his health, but enough to be uncomfortable. 

Remind your SO that you care about him, and that your coming from a place of concern vs. Judgement. It isn't easy. And his feelings are gonna be a little hurt. But reassure him. Use a lot of positive reinforcement vs. Scolding or lecturing.  Compliment his hair or clothes or his smile on days hes brushed his teeth. He'll slowly start associating teeth brushing with feeling good, reciving compliments. When his breath is bad, tell him ""SO, please go brush your teeth"". He'll like the feeling of cleaness and compliments more then he will being reminded to go brush. Eventually it'll become a routine.",1572566595

"QuantumComputing","t5_2r7m8","You're definitely headed the right direction. Just give yourself a PhD and a couple deacons ;)

The 1-9 topics are all important, and you've listed many of the practical uses of quantum computers. In my opinion, there is no ""best"" path to qc. There are many people working on from many angles.

From your first paragraph, it sounds like you want to know what's out there so you can determine what path leads there, is that correct? If so and if I were you, I'd search the internet and read news articles looking for big picture info:
1. Quantum hardware -&gt; how do you make a qc and what are the different types? What are the advantages vs disadvantages?
2. Quantum software -&gt; both how quantum algos work AND how do interface with a qc through cloud services
3. Applications -&gt; what applications are out there that make qcs worth it to those companies blowing millions?
4. People working in the field -&gt; academics or people working for companies? What keywords are in the papers they publish?

As the big picture gets painted with news/wikipedia you can draw in more details.

You ask for details about points 1. and 2. To learn the details how this stuff works, go and work with it. When you don't understand something, dive into it! Also, pick a qc cloud service. There are a few. I use qiskit, but that's just me. If you pick qiskit. Check out their recent textbook https://community.qiskit.org/textbook/
 It may be confusing at first, but keep at it! When you think you understand something rederive it with pen and paper.

Last, you ask about details for point 3. You've got the big ones. There are some specific use ca see as that are also big like Shor's algo and qBLAS (quantum Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines).

Last thing before I get off this soap box. Find a friend and work on a quantum project together. That will lead to sweet github repos and your understanding will deepen much faster than if you go solo on all this.",1572566595

It’s very Christlike calling your brothers hypocrites as if they’re like the Pharisees right? Why do I deserve this from you? Idk I was just doing some research and don’t want anyone to be led astray and to let people know they should be cautious jumping into this blindly.

The Tins use a MMCX connector while the ZX &amp; Blon use a C-pin, or QDC connector.  I would consider buying a better cable if you purchase either the Blon or ZX, which could double the cost in the end.

So far, the Blon BL03s seem to have less bass than the ZX ZS10 Pros.  As I stated before they just came yesterday and I haven't really put them through their paces.

Segundo ele, não dá para confiar no jornal.

 A seguir, a nota da **Folha** sobre as declarações do presidente.

      

  “A **Folha** lamenta mais uma atitude abertamente discriminatória do presidente da República contra o jornal e vai seguir fazendo, em relação a seu governo, o jornalismo crítico e apartidário que a caracteriza e que praticou em relação a todos os governos. A [entrevista mencionada pelo presidente](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/bolsonaro-ve-babaquice-da-pf-e-quer-arejada-na-direcao-da-policia.shtml) reflete de maneira correta o conteúdo de suas declarações. Ela foi [produzida a partir de uma conversa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/09/bolsonaro-ve-babaquice-da-pf-e-quer-arejada-na-direcao-da-policia.shtml) inicialmente feita off the records (não destinada à publicação, no jargão jornalístico). Ao final da conversa, Bolsonaro autorizou que a **Folha** publicasse suas declarações, evitando reproduzir os palavrões pronunciados por ele. O jornal respeitou o pedido, ao contrário do que o presidente afirma agora.”

Also to be conscious of where queries go awry and how to find and fix them, and how to do testing in Django (there isn't one answer). Bonus marks for DRF or Graphene experience.

That means he knew he would have to take measures in the future to counter this Townsend Directive. He planned to have Sam train Liz in the ways she would need to succeed in law enforcement.

I see there being multiple reasons that led to Red choosing to surrender when he did. I think he always planned to, but the timing must have been a combination of events. First, he had been fighting off Berlin for years. Then we know that it was her first day as a profiler. And we have no idea what other factors from Katarina's past. 

If he had Sam train Liz, then his surrender was the hands-on part to teach her to think like a criminal to be a better agent. All of his plan could have been his way of taking down the Townsend Directive and remove the danger to Katarina. If that's true, then Red chose Liz to be the path to accomplish this goal and that's why he surrendered to the FBI.",1572566599

"AnimalRights","t5_2qhtg","I just don't understand. Honestly u/Maschinenherz why is treating this adorable monkey (it is a monkey btw not an ape) like a loved family member cruel? The monkey, Curtis is loved and interacted with by his human daddy. He is groomed, fed well, entertained, and in short has a life that exceeds the safety and comfort of a monkey in the wild. He is having all of his physical, emotional and social skills meet by his new human home and parent. 

In the wild Curtis would be drinking water contaminated with bacteria, viri, animal and monkey feces and urine. Curtis would be eating bit of meat, rotten meat by the way, because Curtis would have to scavenge the meat, waiting for lions,  hyenas, and other carnivores to leave a perfectly good kill. Carnivores that would not like Curtis coming over for a sample of a 3 day old leg of antelope that has been in the hot sun with flies breeding on the meat and laying eggs in it. And when Curtis enjoyed a leisurely meal of berries, fruits, nuts, insects, and leaves it would not be leisurely, monkeys travel in troops and they will descend on most food sources in mass fighting, scratching, biting, and raising hell against other smaller monkeys to get their share. That food will have been defecated on by other animals, insects, reptiles and birds so it will be nasty and half dirt.

With the risk of rotten food, contaminated water, filthy fecal contaminated food, and the risk of infection from bites, scratches, death from beatings and large cats and other animals actively hunting Curtis, I think that a meal from Five Guys might rather than being unhealthy might be the safest and most healthy meals a monkey would ever eat, as long as they demand unsalted nuts.

Curtis doesn't wear human clothes. They are custom made monkey clothes, made to fit Curtis with out being uncomfortable. I mean seriously, people dress dogs in silly clothes. They may look stupid to me but dog cloths are not cruel and some people like them.

One other thing you mentioned was that treating Curtis like a toy is ""horrible"". We don't say that people that drive around with their small dog in their labs are horrible. We don't even call it unsafe which it is.

I don't think that animal lovers really deserve to be called cruel or bad people doing bad things.",1572566599

I'll try to answer your question, but first a piece of advice: I don't know anything about findom, so the first thing I would do is make sure it's legal wherever you live, in case the arrangement could somehow constitute abuse. Then, if you actually decide to do it, I would hang onto any money he gives you as part of the arrangement and give it back to him if the relationship ever ends. You don't even have to tell him until then...that way he gets the experience, but you know you aren't screwing him over.

Okay, now into what you actually asked. This is such a funny question to me, as a fully submissive slave. :-P

What do I get out of it? I get to serve my Master, with every fiber of my being! I get to belong entirely to the person I love most in the world, and see them glow with a type of empowerment most people will never get to experience. I get to be owned!

I know I'm probably not giving you the answer you're looking for, but...it's just who I am! It's not about ""getting"" something, it's about BEING something. It's about being an extension of my Master, in everything I am and everything I do. I've known it's who I am...well, for as long as I can remember! I don't have some repressed childhood trauma, I wasn't abused, and there's nothing wrong with me...it's just me, and I would never have it any other way.

*****
&gt; Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has spent 99 days at Mar-a-Lago compared with 20 days at Trump Tower, according to NBC News.

&gt; Although Mr. Trump ran his presidential transition from Trump Tower and some aides had expected him to spend many weekends there in his Louis XIV-style triplex on the 58th floor, his presence created traffic headaches for New Yorkers and logistical and security challenges for the Secret Service.

&gt; It has been an open question whether he would ever return full time to New York City.In addition, Secret Service protection for Mr. Trump after his presidency ends would continue to snarl traffic in Midtown Manhattan - as would tourists and potential protests in front of Trump Tower - particularly if Mr. Trump chose to live there full time.

The way I see it is when you are 15 and the person is 5 years older than you, that’s 33% of your life proportionally. But if you are 30 and they’re 5 years older, that’s only like a 5 year difference. Not to mention that if you don’t want to dat someone because of their age, then they probably aren’t the best click for you and the age is just a scapegoat.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","(Copied from another of my comments about a similar thing, with some added stuff.)

Creature  templates that can make monsters more menacing, and can offer some  quick adjustments for an encounter. A revised half-dragon, more  lycanthropes, vampires, and other such similar creatures. Also things  like giant versions of creatures, smaller versions of creatures, blessed  creatures, half-fiends, half-celestials. All manner of adjustments one  can apply to something. Minion could even be a template added to  creatures, to bring those back for people that want them. Hell buff  monsters across the board in some cases, and re-balance some others.  Most critters are too weak, and the exceptions can be overwhelming. Give  creatures their cool abilities back. Bloated damage and HP only do so  much, though this may require a system redesign.

While  different crit-ranges and multipliers have become class features of  certain classes, I'd like to see some more variance between weapons.  Maybe slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning each do a specific thing on a  crit, light, one handed, two handed, and heavy could all do something  too. Just to add some variance between weapons. Just something to make  them a bit more exciting. A variance between shields would be good too, a  buckler, and a tower shield should not have the same ability to prevent  damage in my mind.

Proper magic  item Cost charts. A DM is still welcome to change them for their own  game of course, but that baselin that existed in 3.5 was a lifesaver.  Maybe even some examples and costs of rare ingredients, That even if you  need to quest for them to make a magic item, you know the value of what  you're giving to your players. I get why they put less focus on magic  items, but it's something that almost every player wants to interact  with at some point, and should have more work put into them. Magic items  could use some better balancing too. The tiers magic items are rated as  make no sense sometimes. (Staff of power feels suitable for a very rare  magic item, and is my gold staple, but it outclasses a few legendary  magic items.) Weapons of legacy were really cool in 3.5 and having them  return would be amazing.

I've  heard good things about the bloodied condition. I like the idea of not  having to weasel the wound status of my opponent constantly from a DM,  and slow down the game. I've heard cool things about skill challenges  from 4e, they might be fun to include. I've never played 4e though so I  may be wrong.

More feats,and  honestly a separation of Feats/ASI's as it can be so punishing for  certain classes. At the very least bring back the bonus feat at 1st  level. It's something I run in my home games. Is it a tad front loaded  for variant humans? Yes, but it tapers off quickly enough. Character  level rather than class level would be a good return to when it comes to  feats and scaling.

I want to see a 2e/3.X style return of campaign settings. Give me more Ravenloft, Give me Dark Sun, give me PLANESCAPE!  and maybe some spelljammer and birthright too. I don't just want a book tat covers an area of a setting I want a book that covers all of it, and further books that offer deep dives into specific area's. Specific bestiary's, magic items, lingo, player options. I want my settings to feel like tree's fro the same forest rather than branches from the same tree.",1572566603

(I will tell you I am very lucky and have a great relationship with my parents, who were willing and able to support me when I asked for help. Not everyone has that.)

I was miserable in my job, hated the meandering career I’d been in for the last 6-7 years, and decided enough was enough and that I was going to take a chance on myself, finally. I thought about the basic stuff I was vaguely interested in (in my case, IT stuff) and enrolled in a general IT associate’s degree path at the community college nearest to my parents. Then, I quit my job on relatively good terms with everyone and nope’d off back to my hometown and moved in with Mom and Dad.

I took some general intro courses—notably, intro to programming and intro to networking. I thought I was gonna turn out to be a programmer, tbh, and I had no idea what networking was, but it turns out I fell in love with networking and that was that.

Worked hard on getting my CCNA while taking Cisco NetAcad courses with an instructor at the community college. That instructor happened to be awesome and seemed to be impressed with my work ethic—I wasn’t working, so I was basically living and breathing Networking. She became a kind of mentor to me.

Eventually, halfway through the 4-class course, that instructor told me about an opening at her company for a junior network engineer. I interviewed and was hired (again, being VERY lucky, both because my instructor took a chance on me and because the company did too). 

My story isn’t going to be everyone’s. I have a ton of privilege and have been very lucky. This is honestly the first time I’ve ever “known someone” who’s helped me get a job—feels like I’ve cashed out all the luck I’m ever going to get in life lol.

Anyway, my point is that not too long ago, I was miserable and never thought I’d amount to anything professionally. So, moral of the story... *Take a chance on yourself.* You really never know what good things can and will happen.",1572566606

"AMA","t5_2r4eo","I am not a psychiatrist so I am definitely not the right person to ask this, but I can tell you about my personal experiences. But I urge you to seek help from a professional, though, even if it's just to rule out the possibility. Make sure they take the time to thoroughly examine you, since I've had it happen that I suspected I had BPD and my doctor very quickly said I didn't. He's the one who put me on antidepressants that time. It's pretty hard to diagnose and you might need to monitor your moods for a long time.

I was diagnosed with type 1, meaning I experience ""mild"" depression and full manic episodes, but there's other types as well. I also have the rapid cycling sub type, which made it harder to diagnose because I face moodswings a lot. I was initially diagnosed with Borderline.

The clearest sign for me is that whenever something very stressful happens my brain goes into flight mode. I get very hyper, might even laugh at everything and just respond the complete opposite way I should in that situation.

The manic episodes are the biggest indicator, of course, but they are harder to recognise since you generally kinda grow into them. It doesn't happen overnight. For me, I recognised it for the first time when I had had a depressive episode and two weeks later I was so happy and hyper that it didn't make sense. Not much later I was so hyper that I drove myself crazy. I did things I normally wouldn't do. The stealing, the prostitution, etc. I even had some very violent thoughts. Agitation and impulsiveness are a big part of mania. It's like my whole idea of right and wrong had changed.

It happened again after I had been sexually abused, a situation I honestly wouldn't have gotten myself into if I had been thinking clearly, although that doesn't excuse what that guy did. It's like my brain was telling me nothing bad had happened. My brain was so good at it that I was unusually happy for two weeks, until I finally realised what had happened. I got a severe depression episode after that and wanted to die. I was admitted to the hospital.

It still took many similar events like this before I got diagnosed a year later. Whenever I'm manic I am very self destructive. I have self harmed, abused alcohol, gotten into dangerous situations, got into situations where I knew the other person would sexually abuse me, etc. etc. I always feel this agitated feeling inside of me that I need to drown with some sort of relief.",1572566606

"news","t5_2qh3l","Okay, I'll bite. I used to work for the BSA in Irving. I was there for a little over a year and I quit because I realize how bad things were going in that organization and I didn't want to be on that ship when it sinks into the ocean. When I was working there, The BSA and the Mormon organzation decided to cut ties with each other. The official story was that it was a mutual thing. It wasn't. The BSA was being more and more lenient with it's values and things came to a head when the BSA allowed gay leaders and gay scouts into the organization. Ton of people that had nothing to do with the Mormons left as well. 

While a number of things could contribute to the Boy Scouts demise; Molestation scandal, competing youth programs and organization, internet and videos games becoming more popular, devaluing and erroding core values, deregulate badges and accomplishments, ect., these things were nothing compared to the blow that the Mormons had dealt to the BSA. Think about this: 1 out of 6 Boy Scouts is a Mormon. That's a significant number of people leaving a group all at once. 

The Church of Latter Saints had a lot of sway when it came to the control of the BSA and by the time they decided to leave, The BSA was left scrambling for new members. They're hedging their bets on 2 new programs. First, the Lion Cubs. These new scouts are for Kindergardners. Typically, Scouting starts at first grade but the BSA needed new members fast and wanted to get to kids as young as possible. It's kinda hard to determine if this is going to work but it's a long term deal so we'll have to see. And the second? The rebranding of the Boy Scouts to  ""Scouts"" and adding girls to the organization. It was only just recent that they did this but from the response from a number of parents and volunteers to even people within the HQ in Irving is that a chunk of people were outraged. I saw a ton of angry emails and reponses that led me to believe that this was not a great idea and may end up back firing on them.

As for my time at the BSA, It was probabaly one of the most regretful, most stressful job I've ever had. I want to clear up the misconception that it was ""right wing"" or ""Christian"". It really wasn't. Nobody ever talked politics and nobody talked about religion either. There was a ""Good Ole Boy"" atmosphere (My manager was totally unqualified for her position.) and attitude that made implementing any changes that might actually help the organization nearly impossible. (The most common phrase is ""That's how we've/I've always done it"".)  It definetly isn't the most welcoming place if you're young or a minority walking around the office. I did take into consideration that a majority of the employees there have been there since the 80s and 90s and maybe as far back as the 70s. 

The truth is; the BSA COULD have survived had they adapted years ago but now that time has passed. People that I used to work with are contacting me on LinkedIn to ask for a reference now that the writing is on the wall. It's really sad. (Hell, even some of the employees I work with don't even belive in it. I had a department head that had 2 young boys and didn't want them to join because he though the organization was weird.) I worked there and while I had an awful experience, I felt like it could have been great for boys to learn about life and gain some experience.",1572566606

B3) **Wait 24 hours** from this post to make another unless this post or the next is prearranged with a particular lender

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. B) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately C) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if dankT3 has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=dankT3&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

The mom clearly isn't taking the young girl's opinions/emotions seriously, which is just another layer of frustration and anger for the girl.

There's another clip after this where it's explained the little sister is being driven to practice and the older sister comes along for the ride. The little sister can't make it any clearer that she fucking hates the older one and just wants to get away from her. Then for the one thing younger one probably enjoys, practicing whatever it is that she does, the older sister just *has* to involve herself.

Then the older sister decides to post this on the internet for the world to see, like it vindicates her somehow. It's really fucked up to broadcast your siblings emotional distress to the world.",1572566608

I created all the items and rewards that the players can get and created small little cards so the players can keep track of what they get. I'm excited to play out a story I made and hopefully everything goes well. Let me know what you think :D

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O diretor de Assuntos Corporativos da Petrobras, Eberaldo Almeida, afirmou nesta quinta (31) que a estatal “não tem dúvida nenhuma” de que o óleo encontrado nas praias do Nordeste é de origem venezuelana. Ele afirmou ainda que não é possível estimar por enquanto os custos da resposta ao desastre.

 Na quarta (30) pesquisadores da Universidade Federal de Alagoas levantaram a possibilidade de que a origem do óleo fosse a produção de petróleo no sul da Bahia, a partir de imagens de satélite que indicaram uma mancha no litoral da região.

 “Não temos dúvida nenhuma de que o óleo é da Venezuela”, disse Almeida nesta quinta, em entrevista na conferência internacional de petróleo OTC. Ele reforçou que a origem foi comprovada “de maneira inequívoca”.

 “Agora, é óbvio que não vazou lá na Venezuela”, frisou o diretor da Petrobras, respondendo a questionamentos em redes sociais sobre a impossibilidade de um derrame no país vizinho atingir o Brasil.

  Os [estudos da ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/10/petroleo-no-nordeste-e-mistura-de-tres-campos-venezuelanos-diz-petrobras.shtml)[Petrobras mostram que o óleo é uma mistura](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/10/petroleo-no-nordeste-e-mistura-de-tres-campos-venezuelanos-diz-petrobras.shtml) da produção de três campos na venezuelanos. 

 Há uma semana, a estatal venezuelana PDVSA divulgou nota negando responsabilidade pelo vazamento e acusando o governo brasileiro de politizar o debate. A empresa solicita, porém, que o cliente que possa ter derramado o óleo se identifique para dar início a investigações.

 O governo trabalha com a suspeita de que o [vazamento tenha sido provocado por um navio na costa brasileira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/10/mourao-diz-que-navio-legal-que-ejetou-combustivel-e-provavel-culpado-por-oleo.shtml). Na quinta, o vice-presidente, Hamilton Mourão, afirmou que as investigações estão próximas de detectar o responsável.

 Almeida não quis comentar o tema, alegando que a Petrobras não participa da investigação. A estatal tem apoiado o governo no trabalho de limpeza das praias, sob a coordenação do Ibama (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renováveis).

 O diretor da Petrobras disse que ainda [não há um cálculo parcial dos custos que a empresa vem tendo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/10/brasil-nao-destina-royalties-do-petroleo-para-prevenir-desastres-como-o-atual.shtml) nesse esforço. A empresa espera ser reembolsada pelos gastos, em um processo que passou a ser acompanhado pelo TCU (Tribunal de Contas da União) na semana passada.

 De acordo com Almeida, porém, o valor gasto não terá impacto relevante no balanço financeiro da estatal.",1572566609

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Seven people materialized on board my ship, weapons drawn. Stern, in all his pasty glory, led up the party of six other Terran shock troops.

He held up a hand as they materialized, holding fire.

""I hereby charge you with a violation of Section 4 of the Terran property code, Elaine Sharp,"" he sneered as he said it, ""Turn over the stolen property or prepare to be forcefully detained.""

""Her name is Genesis,"" I said, voice level, ""and honestly, she's got a way bigger quarrel with you fucks than I do. Her call.""

""Arrest them!"" Stern shouted, dropping his fist dramatically.

The shock team started to charge, then just... froze. Stern turned in confusion, face reddening.

""SUBDUE THEM, YOU IDIOTS,"" he shouted, spittle flying.

I turned my gaze to Genesis. She was still sitting, but her eyes had turned solid black and she was panting.

The soldiers' faces contorted in fear, still unable to move. Stern, connecting the dots, flew fully into a rage.

""FINE, I'LL DO IT MYSELF,"" he screamed, drawing his sidearm.

With preternatural speed, Genesis leapt from the table, slamming into Stern with way more force than should have been possible given her tiny figure. She rode him to the ground, both hands wrapped around his throat, straddling his chest.

""Beg."" she said, squeezing his throat with one hand and using the other to drag a fingernail down his face, drawing blood.

""Please, please,"" Stern whimpered, struggling. It was a stark contrast from the rage he'd shown moments before, but now he was showing his true colors. ""Don't kill me, please. I'll leave you alone, I'll make Terra leave you alone.""

Genesis leaned in closer, licking the blood off of his face. If her motions had been unnerving before, they were downright alien now, and I couldn't help but shiver as I looked on in shock.

""We both know you can't do that,"" she whispered, squeezing tighter. Then, she reached her free hand out to me, gesturing for my gun.

Not one to disagree with an angry god, I passed it to her, watching to shock troopers warily. the took it from me, and pressed the muzzle against one of Stern's kneecaps behind her.

""OPEN YOUR EYES!"" Genesis screamed at an ear-perforating pitch, directly into Stern's whimpering face. His eyes snapped open, unable to look away.

She pulled the trigger, blowing his knee into a pulpy mess. He screamed an anguished scream, rivaling the worst I'd heard during my prison stint. Genesis didn't let up.

""No one. Will ever. Take. Me. Back."" she whispered again, somehow more threatening than before.

She moved the gun to his other knee and pulled the trigger again. He didn't scream as loud this time, and it took on a broken tone.

""Not you. Not your boss. Not your scientists. Not your shock troops.""

This time, she placed the gun at his crotch. He whimpered slightly, but now seemed completely unable to speak.

She pulled the trigger a third time, tilting his head up at the same time and looking right into his eyes.

I didn't know whether to be horrified or impressed, so I settled for both.

""God damn, Genesis,"" I said, staring at the bleeding heap on the floor.

""I'm sorry, too much?"" She asked, turning to face me, blood dripping from her cryo-pod gown, and I saw a genuine frown on her face.

""No, no,"" I replied, ""he's always been a scumbag. You just surprised me, that's all.""

""Okay, good,"" she said, smiling again. ""What do you wanna do with these?""

She gestured at the still-frozen shock troops.

I shrugged, ""Unless you wanna go crazy we can just push them out of the air lock.""

""I got out all the rage, for now,"" she said, a pleased expression on her face. Then, she wiped my gun on her gown and handed it back.

""Thanks,"" I replied, accepting the sidearm, ""Computer, put the shields back up and return to course. Oh, and prime the air lock.""",1572566610

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","I like this a lot! I really enjoy the Bloodborne setting (sans aliens really but what can you do), and this is a nice, simplistic translation. The trick weapons and mechanics for them are very nice as well.

My suggestions for the rally and parry mechanics:

**Rally**
&gt;Whenever you take damage, you deduct the full total from your health, but add half of the total damage taken to your temporary HP. If you land a successful attack on the creature/beast that inflicted the damage before the end of your next turn, you lose the temporary HP generated by the attack and add it to your current HP.

I feel this more closely mimics how the Rally mechanic behaves in Bloodborne, where you can recover a portion of the damage you took from an attack with an almost-immediate counterattack, but still imposes a limit for the window in which you can do so, as well as not making it too strong. It might need fine-tuning as I'm just realizing it may clash with other temporary HP mechanics (bullets), or could cause recursion. Perhaps introducing a ""rally number"" where you store the number (equal to half the amount of the damage you took), and convert that to your current HP instead. Temporary HP could also work with a line such as ""this temporary HP is lost at the end of your next turn, or if you are hit by an attack before it can be converted into current HP."" But that gets more complicated too...

Refining it further:

**Rally**
&gt;Whenever you take damage, if you land a successful melee attack on the creature/beast that inflicted the damage before the end of your next turn, you regain HP equal to half of the damage you took. This may apply to more than one attack, e.g. if you are damaged twice by a creature's multiattack, and you land two melee attacks against the creature before the end of your next turn, you recover HP equal to half of the damage dealt by each attack (calculated separately for each attack).

That's probably the best way of doing it. No need to work around other temporary HP-based abilities or functions, although it does require players and/or the DM to keep track of damage dealt. Also specifies that it's limited to melee attacks, because I don't think you can Rally with firearms in the game.

**Parry**
&gt;When you are targeted by a creature with a melee attack, and you are holding a firearm in your off-hand, you can use your Reaction to attempt a parrying shot. Make an attack roll with your firearm, contested by the attack roll of the creature attacking you. If you win the contest, your firearm attack hits, the creature's attack misses, and you may make one weapon attack against the creature attacking you as part of the same Reaction. If you lose the contest, the creature's attack hits, regardless of whether its roll would have hit you or not.

This represents approximately how it behaves in Bloodborne, I think, without getting too complicated. I initially thought it should be two attack rolls, where there's a different outcome for any combination of your attack hitting or missing, as well as the creature's attack hitting or missing (say you miss and he hits, he scores a critical, or vice versa), but a simple contest is probably more elegant. It rewards the aggression, but comes at a not-insignificant risk. Might need more fine-tuning to account for multiattacks.

I think the bullet mechanics should be redone, too. I like the idea of blood bullets being implemented in that you can generate firearm ammunition using your HP, but I dislike the fact that you don't have the choice not to when regular ammunition is present in the game. I don't currently have a great idea on how to do that other than regular ammunition rules, though. Perhaps each firearm has an inherent amount of ""bullets"" they can expend per long rest, and you can exceed that amount by generating blood bullets (perhaps an amount of bullets/HP equal to what you have listed by default)? Regaining bullets on long rest sort of mimics the idea of resting at a lamp pulling bullets automatically from your storage box, as well, and it's not like you can't always farm plenty of bullets in the game.

Really quick after-the-facts as well, I would love to see Insight implemented (in close relation to Sanity, ie the more Insight you have the more susceptile you are to Sanity loss), as well as the Beast Blood Pellets/Beasthood stat somehow.

"Stellaris","t5_39cuc","Just because there are more sources of attack speed does not make damage better. There are no diminishing returns on attack speed.

If I attack once a second for 10 damage for 10 DPS, a 100% AS buff is is 20 DPS, a 100% damage buff is 20 DPS, a 50% damage and 50% attack speed buff is 20 DPS. 


&gt; High damage also reduces chances of disengangement.

High burst does effect the chance of disengangement. The issue here is that damage is FAR more dependent on weapon type for burst than bonus damage.

For example, a base XL battleship has 3000 hp, 1 X slot and 4 L weapons, 6 utility slots, and 2 utility augments. Because disengangement only triggers off hull damage below 50%, our threshold to try and prevent disengangement is 1500 hp in 1 volley.

If you use 4 large plasma cannons, that's 1116 damage per a volley. Increased by 25%, it becomes 1395. So 2 volleys are required no matter what to break 1500 meaning that 25% did nothing here. Swap that to neutron launchers and each volley is 5278 damage, so without the 25% we are already killing it in one 1 volley. In fact, we can kill it from full hp in 1 volley. This is despite the fact that plasma cannons and neutron launchers have about the same DPS. You can basically  do this for every weapon type in the game and it won't substantially effect disengangement chance because weapon type will always overshadow a 25% damage buff here. That's  just how  the game is designed.


&gt; Evasion is a % chance to miss, its effectively a % reduction in average DPS, for most weapons, it doesnt matter whether its damage or attack speed unless its a very slow firing, high damage weapon, in which case attack speed would be better.

Correct, and as you already pointed out, burst is critical to preventing disengangement. All of the best weapons follow this mantra, including the meta defining X slot weapons. Which is why attack speed always is better.


There is one last reason speed wins, beta strike advantage.

A common engangement opening of 26 DE battleships vs 26 FP battleships. Defensive stats are equal (3k shield, 3k armor, 3k hp) and both are running that same weapons loadout of 1 XL (lances). Normally, the AI overkills greatly here but lets assume all ships have been micro to perfection and every attack hits for minimum overkill just so the DE can do better. First volley is XL weapons, so 8 shots kills a Battleship for the FP and 7 shots for the DE. This means both fleets lose 3 ships instantly. Additional, the DE forces a fourth ship to disengage while the FP only strips the shields of the fourth and touches the armor. I will be assuming that all critically damaged ships retreat, again, because this favors the DE. Realistically the FP will be using no retreat and the DE is screwed but this FP player is new.

So the DE are leading 23 to 22. Now the beta strike happens. For the DE this takes about 10 seconds. For the FP, it takes about 7. So the FP strikes before the DE even fires taking out the injured ship and another 2 ships. The 20 remaining DE ships attack 3 seconds later and take out 2 ships and barely force a 3rd to disengage. The remaining 19 FP ships take out 2 more ships and injury 1 more 4 seconds later. 6 seconds after than the remaining  18 DE ships kill 2 ships and injury 1 more. **One** second later the remaining 17 FP ships take out 2 ships and force 1 ship to retreat. Then 7 seconds later, the FP volleys AGAIN and takes out another 2 with 1 injured. 2 seconds after that the DE's remaining 13 ships kill 2 ships. Then 5 seconds later the 15 FP kills 2. 5 more seconds and the 11 remaining DE kill 2. 2 seconds later the 13 FP kill 1 and force another to retreat. 7 seconds later the FP attacks AGAIN and kills 1 and forces another retreat. 1 second after that the 7 remaining DE kill 1 ship. 6 seconds later the 12 FP kill 1 and force 1 to retreat. The 5 remaining DE ships force another ship to retreat after 4 seconds but the battle is over since the 5 DE can nolonger kill with 1 volley and the 10 FP have no issues.

So even with stacking the advantages in the DE's favor they still lost both the fight and more ships because after the first volley, the FP will always hit first meaning they remove DE ships from combat before they ever get to make use of their own buffs.",1572566612

This is Hellina Sterlingfeather, my knowledge domain cleric/necromancer for a new on and off campaign I recently joined! She’s an absolute history nerd, lover of all things ancient and mysterious. She’s such a history nerd that she took up not only strict religious education in a convent in order to expand her knowledge of the universe but also secretly dabbled in necromancy, hoping to someday resurrect her favorite historical figures in order to just chat and have tea. But through her time in her convent and wizard university, she uncovered a deadly secret about a historical tyrant that, if proven, could change the course of history. Now she just needs to learn the right spell to, frankly enough, raise hell upon the land.

Hellina is simultaneously an ancient, elder entity who, as she humorously calls herself, is a “nexus of knowledge and wisdom” and also a curious, nosy child who can’t pass by even the most quotidian things without asking about its origin or purpose of existence. She’s incredibly passionate about her interests but can be a bit too enthusiastic about them and never know when to stop talking.

&gt;He says another kid took his toy

Do you mean actually *his* toy or 'the classroom's toy that he had at that point'? Either way, he's 4, he doesn't have the emotional maturity to work his way through this and then on top of it he feels hard done by with the teacher not helping him out when he feels justified about his 'ownership' of the toy. Was the teacher trying to promote 'sharing' when in reality your son was playing with a toy and then another kid bulldozed in and took it? - because your kid is right, that's not 'sharing'. Life was too much for him. It happens with 4 year olds. I feel like all of the consequences together are too much, keeping him in his room until he goes back to school is too much. That's not going to help him learn how to manage his emotions.

If this is a completely 'out of character' event, it happens and a giant punishment might not have much influence on the future since struggling to cope with disappointment is a development thing. If the fits are a common thing then yeah, there's more to work on.",1572566613

Even though it looks like RWBY’s Japanese popularity has waned a great deal, it looks like they’re doing everything they can to keep it alive. Seeing as Ruby is front and center on the BBTAG 2.0 box art right next to Neo. There’s also an ongoing manga as well. 

Of course this is me being optimistic, I don’t think RWBY has fallen out of favor in Japan.

That went against my assumption since I knew beforehand that the global count was declining. So I looked it up to see if I could corroborate my findings. Sure enough, there was a separate NASA article confirming my findings and mentioning some of the conservatory efforts undertaken by Senegal, one of the countries I was looking at during this work.

Edit: Of course the increase wasn't all from their efforts. A lot of the regrowth was from recovering drought conditions, but it's still a very inspiring thing to see the efforts these countries are taking.",1572566615

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Funnily enough, letting the city burn is something Bloodraven would avoid at all costs. When you look at his actions he went out of his way to avoid further bloodshed, to the point of dishonorably killing Daemon by first slaying his elder son in front of him knowing he would pick him up and then murdering him in cold blood, despite *being his half-brother,* and knowing that his other son would take Blackfyre from his father so he slayed him while he was doing that too. He murdered in cold blood both his half-brother and his nephews. 

And before that he tried to get him arrested, and after Daemon's death, when Bittersteel began the charge from the right flank, he decided to meet him in single combat and lose his eye rather than let more soldier die.

After that he went out of his way over and over to avoid military conflict (and thus bloodshed) at all costs, to the point of capturing a Blackfyre pretender, ignoring all diplomatic procedures and executing him to ensure the Targaryen throne.  Yes, Bloodraven was brutal but in a world where people fight and die for honour he tainted his own honour by repeatedly kinslaying in the most bloodless and dishonourably possible way in order to avoid bloodshed.

&amp;#x200B;

Bloodraven would see that Dany was gonna burn the city and before she could do anything (before she went mad) he would kill her with poison. Again, dishonourably, kinslaying, but this is what he would do. This is what he did many times.",1572566616

That *you* play RPGs for.

&gt; FOR STARTERS

Personal preference. Not a universal opinion.

&gt; I did, however, hate that the game literally just gives you all of the flight paths.

No it doesn't. Perhaps you used the heirloom flight map on that character and forgot?

&gt; So wait...what's the enjoyment from leveling then?

Playing the game. If the only enjoyment you ever got out of the game was over-leveling everything, that's too bad.

&gt; Where's the grind to try to get to the next level so I can more easily deal with this area I'm currently in or move on to another area?

Still there, of course; not all areas start at 1 or 10; you have to get to their minimum levels.

&gt; Where's the possibility of doing a random dungeon or two as a healer to get ahead so the questing grind feels a little easier?

Gone.

&gt; Why isn't this an optional feature for questing with friends like Borderlands 3 implemented?

Nope, the US hasn't assimilated African Americans and, for a multitude of social reasons, it can't do so. White and black communities are on average pretty different from each other with different conditions and different issues which give birth to different cultures, different mentalities and even different English dialects.

In fact, for better or worse the US is a mix of melting pot and mosaic of cultures, while Turkey was founded - for better or worse - with the idea of creating something monolithic.

One could even argue that the US has a Black Question that it isn't intent on fixing, while Turkey has a Kurdish Question it is attempting to fix in its own peculiar way.

Other countries like India, Pakistan, China or Russia are massive and diverse but because they either have a strong unifying founding ideology (first two) that helps overcome the issues that derive from being part of a recent political creation or a state with a long history which is inherently conceived as multinational (latter two) don't have any internal national questions, and as a consequence don't attempt to solve them, especially not as Turkey does.

be careful with that one eh?? 

....dudes that get off on verbal abuse, often escalate their behaviour.... and i want you to be safe &amp; happy 💖

i only bothered to mention this because i still remember when i realises that the screaming lead to the fucking (i was too scared to say no in thr beginning)- &amp; as i thought he was an otherwise great guy, i tolerated it..... i just silently did whatever i was supposed to do, &amp; waited for life to resume after..... but of course, like most dudes who get off on abuse- he escalated- &amp; .... my body was used &amp; abused when he wanted, &amp; i had an otherwise great bf.... but then he started choking me unconscious- not stopping even when i screamed /  fought.... turns out he liked that too.... fuck rememberring this shit is hard...

but im rememberring it because your line

&gt;So he had his moment, lecturing me, trying to make me admit I was using. Deny everything, right? So then I realized, this jerk gets a hard on yelling at me!! He wanted to fuck! I figured it would get rid of him so we did

- I remember *that exact thought process and the subsequent experience* - just give him what he wants, so life can resume as normal.....

He should have respected your need to sleep =/ 

but we dont live in fairytails, &amp; real life requires all sorts of compromises- I just- want you to be safe....

that ex i was talking about, nearly killed me multiple times- even when I was pregnant with his first child- he raped &amp; choked me out to the point i had a seizure, &amp; then after came- he performed cpr.... but he didn't start out that violent- it started with the yelling.....


I'm sorry for this massive reply- &amp; i sincerely hope this is a one off experience for you- ... but if it's not, &amp; things get worse- please don't settle for it just because you love him &amp; life is otherwise good- reach out to support services &amp; let them help you...

 You are no less worthy of love &amp; respect- to You &amp; to your bodily autonomy because you use drugs....

Again- i really hope this was a 1 off, &amp; never escalates, but if it does- ***please*** dont think twice about getting the fuck out-... You matter!! Your need for sleep matters!!- &amp; you should never ever have to do anything you dont want to!!
 ❤💖💜💙💚💛

(&amp; this msg may apply to many women in here- i hope it reaches them too.....)

if you made it this far down- thank you for taking the time to  read all this- i appreciate it!! &amp; I hope your future is fucking awesome !!!


much loves!!

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O vice-presidente Hamilton Mourão disse nesta quinta-feira (31) que a democracia é o melhor sistema, apesar de imperfeito.

 A fala ocorreu durante uma palestra do vice na Associação Empresarial de Jaraguá do Sul (SC), horas depois de o deputado federal Eduardo Bolsonaro, filho do presidente Jair Bolsonaro, [afirmar que resposta para radicalização da esquerda](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/bolsonaro-desautoriza-filho-e-diz-que-eduardo-esta-sonhando-sobre-ai-5.shtml) “pode ser um novo AI-5”.

 Sem citar a fala do deputado, Mourão afirmou que o governo Bolsonaro se pauta por pilares da civilização ocidental, incluindo a democracia.

 “Por mais imperfeito que seja o sistema democrático, já dizia Winston Churchill [ex-primeiro-ministro do Reino Unido]: ‘é o melhor de todos’”, declarou.

  Após ser desautorizado inclusive por seu pai, Eduardo Bolsonaro voltou atrás e afirmou que [""não existe qualquer possibilidade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/apos-criticas-do-pai-eduardo-diz-que-nao-existe-qualquer-possibilidade-de-retorno-do-ai-5.shtml) de retorno do AI-5"".

 O vice-presidente emendou dizendo que o Brasil não é como a China, que vive num regime comunista. “A coisa não funciona assim, a democracia é a eterna busca do equilíbrio, é o três, o tripé, o número perfeito”, completou.

 [Na semana passada,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/10/estou-num-pais-capitalista-diz-bolsonaro-ao-chegar-a-pequim.shtml) quando esteve no país oriental, Bolsonaro respondeu que estava em um país capitalista quando questionado sobre o possível apoio ao regime local.

 Mourão acrescentou aos pilares do governo o pacto de gerações, que incluiria a garantia de um país “organizado” entre várias gerações.

 “O pacto de gerações estava sendo rompido anteriormente com [a Previdência”,](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/previdencia/) declarou, afirmando que, sem a reforma feita pelo atual governo, os jovens de hoje não teriam acesso ao benefício no futuro.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","&gt;So i'm in Scotland, and i'm in the equivalent of Junior year at an American high school. This year we do our ""Higher"" qualifications, these are the important ones that get us into universities or colleges.

Also in Scotland. You're doing you junior year equivalent but doing your Highers? For most that's the last ones you'll do. If Highers aren't senior year I don't know what is.

&gt;This is especially clear with some of my friends, smart guys who did well with Sophmore year exams

Just call them standard grades, nationals, highers etc.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't understand. The push is to move up. Go further up. Despite what some parents say, you don't have to decide the rest of your life now...just the next steps and have it lead...somewhere. Many don't know what they want to do by the end of school. But to remain stagnant is a mistake (I did and fuck I wish I used my opportunities to go to uni). Uni isn't the only method. If you have an actual plan that's fine. What else did you stay on to do your highers for if not go to uni? You'd have left in 4th year to go to college to be a plumber, electrician, hairdresser, chef, etc. Maybe even start a business. Go get some forklift training or an HGV licence and buy a lorry and start a goods moving business. Careers advisers exist,  on the highstreet. Head to the jobcentre on your lunch break and see whats available...or well it's 2005 now, go online whenever you want to monsterjobs,s1 jobs or something.

Scotland is an awesome place with tons of different alleys to go down. Problem is, nobody knows what road they want. Uni is just a great place to broaden your knowledge, give something you are interested in a go and see where that leads. And since your tuition fee's are paid for until you're 25 then what better time? You're young, little to no responsibilities. You have the time for education. Get a degree and despite what some think, a degree does open doors...not always the doors that are proimised but many jobs are just locked behind ""have a degree"".

Or you could do what I did. Not go to uni without a plan. Get a job and slowly get ones that pay more and learning all sorts of skills that anybody can learn in a week and eventually hit a roof with barely anywhere to go without learning something specific. Thankfully I went to college and got into IT. Had I done this years beforehand I'd have been able to do a proper BA in Comp Science or something and have a better job than I do now. But no, I fucked up and just did fuck all with my opportunities and Highers than I got.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, what exactly do you mean by ""destroys itself"". We have ended up with a pretty highly educated country . The UK itself is in the  [top 10](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/most-educated-countries/) and Scotland showing some of the highest Educated areas in the  [UK](https://www.businessinsider.com/eurostat-most-educated-places-in-britain-2016-8?r=US&amp;IR=T) and even  [Europe](https://www.businessinsider.com/eurostat-most-educated-places-in-europe-2016-8?r=UK). For such a small country   [we do do rather well](https://www.businessforscotland.com/scotlands-people-are-the-most-highly-educated-in-europe/) with our education system and   On a per head basis, Scotland wins 43% more in EU research funding than the rest of the UK which when compared to England is quite a big thing.  *Scotland’s universities take about 12% of the UK’s ERA funding – well above its 8.4%% population share.*  We're a smart bunch of fuckers, that's for sure.

"grammar","t5_2qhwy","&gt;I've been told that we are required to put a comma before ""but"" when the two statements linked by that ""but"" are independent, ...

Nope, that's not a grammar rule. Though, it is a commonly stated ""style rule"", which is often taught by teachers and books as though it is a grammar rule.

.

&gt; 1. _""A professional license demonstrates proficiency in technical aspects of engineering but it **also** means that you're well versed in the law.""_

&gt; 2. _""A professional license demonstrates proficiency in technical aspects of engineering**,** but it means that you're well versed in the law.""_

Both of your examples involve a 'but'-coordination of two main clauses. For your two examples, the comma is optional. (The ""also"" is an adjunct in clause structure.)

Many style guides will want a comma to be used there before the ""but"".

Personally for me I'd probably prefer the comma, for it seems that the presence of a comma would probably help the reader to parse your two examples.

"Tools","t5_2r8ec","As usual I found good info in the comments on toolguyd:

Using FlexVolt 20V Max/60V Max math, let’s say each Li-ion cell has max voltage of 4.0V per cell. 3.6V is nominal and more correct, but for the sake of consistency, we’ll use Dewalt calculation conventions.

FlexVolt 9.0Ah battery: 15x 3.0Ah cells x 4.0V = 180 watt-hours
FlexVolt 12.0Ah battery: 15 x 4.0Ah cells x 4.0V = 240 watt-hours
MX Fuel CP battery: 20 x 3.0Ah x 4.0V = 240 watt-hours
MX Fuel XC battery: 40 x 3.0Ah x 4.0V = 480 watt-hours

So, the MX Fuel compact battery holds as much watt-hour power potential as the largest Dewalt FlexVolt battery. The MX Fuel XC battery doubles that.

Now, Milwaukee is using 3.0Ah cells in these MX Fuel batteries. They can very well use 4.0Ah cells, and maybe that’s something we’ll see next year with the second wave of MX Fuel tool and equipment releases.

MX Fuel starts where FlexVolt hits their ceiling.

You could argue that Flexvolt 120V Max, with two batteries can compete here.

How many FlexVole 120V Max tools are there today? Why hasn’t Dewalt come out with more tools that fit two batteries?

It’s not productive to look at numbers like these without context.",1572566625

&gt; SAN FRANCISCO-Twitter&amp;#039;s ban on political advertising is ratcheting up pressure on Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg to follow suit.

&gt; In one case, Facebook mistakenly took down ads for Bush&amp;#039;s baked beans because they contained the word &amp;quot;Bush&amp;quot; and the food company was not registered with Facebook as a political advertiser.

&gt; Daniel Kreiss, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina, said that a middle ground for Twitter and Facebook might be to allow political ads but to prohibit targeting, or showing them only to specific groups of people.

"conlangs","t5_2red7","Yes, it's naturalistic.

However, *vastly more common* is for nominative to have no special marking at all. Not that it always ends in a vowel, but that it's the basic form from which all other cases tack their case endings onto. This is predominately because of how case systems come about: postpositions and such get suffixed onto the end of words, and the ""nominative"" is just the ""leftovers"" where the affixation never happened.

This doesn't mean it can't have a distinct form, but this is usually because other cases shifted away, not that it started out different. For a simplistic situation, take a word *tak* and then say the postposition *im* become attached to it. Then say a) open syllables underwent lengthening, b) long vowels underwent diphthongization, c) intervocal k&gt;x. Now you have the basic, nominative *tak* and the case-inflected *tauxim*, that appears to be using *taux-* as its base instead of *tak-*.

Languages with distinct nominative suffixes *do* exist, but they're not as common and, I believe, predominately come from the collapse of a previous system. For example, maybe an active-stative language that takes an ergative suffix on both the transitive agent and intransitive agent reinterprets it as a general subject marker.

It's also worth saying that, in the majority of cases *nouns themselves* don't have gender markers. Usually gender is a *covert* property, and you can only tell which noun is in which gender based on which agreement pattern they take. (Really, ""gender"" would be much less confusing to people first being introduced to it if it was just described as ""some nouns trigger Class 1 agreement, some nouns trigger Class 2 agreement."") *Assignment* to certain genders may be based in part on the shape of the noun itself, like whether it ends in a consonant or a vowel, or in one type of consonant versus another, but they generally don't host full-fledged gender markers themselves.",1572566626

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Após a pavimentação de estrada ligando o Rio a Minas Gerais, em 2015, moradores de Conservatória, distrito de Valença, na região sul fluminense, passaram a conviver com intenso tráfego de caminhões-tanque. Eles cruzavam o local quase sempre à noite, em comboios formados por quatro ou cinco veículos.

 “Era muito caminhão”, diz Mauro Contrucci, presidente da Associação Comercial Rural e Turística do distrito turístico, conhecido a capital das serenatas. “Passavam em alta velocidade, causando grande incômodo aos moradores.”

 O aumento do fluxo é fruto de uma nova estratégia de [sonegação de impostos nas vendas de etanol](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/05/para-distribuidoras-venda-de-etanol-defendida-por-bolsonaro-leva-a-sonegacao.shtml), segmento considerado hoje o principal problema no mercado brasileiro de combustíveis. O setor estima que cerca de um terço das vendas no país sejam feitas por empresas com histórico de sonegação de impostos.

 Estudo feito pela FGV para a [Plural, empresa que concentra as grandes distribuidoras de combustíveis](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/12/posicao-da-anp-sobre-venda-direta-de-etanol-traz-inseguranca-diz-plural.shtml), estima que as perdas com sonegação nesse setor tenham chegado a R$ 4,8 bilhões em 2018. Considerando outros combustíveis, o valor sobe para R$ 7,2 bilhões.

  “O etanol hidratado é o vilão do problema de inadimplência e adulteração do país”, afirma o diretor da Plural Helvio Rebeschini.

 Segundo a Plural, empresas com histórico de problemas tributários são responsáveis hoje por cerca de meta das vendas no Rio. Em São Paulo, o mercado irregular representaria 40% do consumo.

 Além da sonegação, as distribuidoras acusam adulteração do produto, com adição de metanol ou de volumes de água maiores do que o permitido pela legislação.

 As secretarias de Fazenda de São Paulo e do Rio questionam os números, mas admitem que a sonegação de impostos nas vendas de etanol é um problema. A Fazenda paulista diz que a diversificação no número de fornecedores facilita a sonegação, já que na gasolina os impostos são cobrados só da Petrobras.

 Com a maior alíquota de ICMS sobre o etanol no Brasil, o Rio vem sendo invadido por produtos com suspeita de sonegação, já que a vantagem para fraudadores é maior. A alíquota é de 30%, mais 2% do fundo de pobreza, enquanto em São Paulo é de 12%.

 A diferença faz com que distribuidoras comprem o produto para venda em postos paulistas ou mineiros, mas despejem no Rio com lucros maiores depois de entrar no estado por rotas alternativas, em uma estratégia que foi batizada pela Receita estadual de “Caminho das Índias”.

 “Os comboios vêm por estradas menores ou de terra e têm até batedores para se antecipar à fiscalização”, diz o secretário de Fazenda do Rio, Luiz Claudio Rodrigues de Carvalho. Desde o início do ano, a Receita estadual passou a realizar blitze nas rotas do Caminho das Índias.

 Com maior fiscalização por essas rotas, a Receita estadual apreendeu 1,6 milhão de litros de etanol irregular e autuou carretas com outros 4,5 milhões de litros neste ano. Foram cerca de 110 caminhões com irregularidades —de falta de nota fiscal a nota com destino a outro estado—, uma média de um a cada quase três dias.

 O aumento da fiscalização reduziu o incômodo dos moradores de Conservatória, já que não passam tantos comboios como antes, diz Contrucci. Mas ainda assim as rotas alternativas continuam sendo um desafio para a Fazenda fluminense.

 As apreensões e as autuações são mais concentradas em quatro distribuidoras. Duas delas, Paranapanema e Minuano, foram descredenciadas pela Secretaria de Fazenda e agora têm que pagar impostos por venda, em vez de esperar o fechamento do mês.

 Elas são ligadas à usina Canabrava, no norte fluminense no Rio, beneficiada por um programa que cobra apenas 2% de ICMS sobre a produção local de etanol. A suspeita é que estejam comprando produto em São Paulo e vendendo como se fosse produzido no Rio.

 A Secretaria de Fazenda não informa o nome das outras, mas, segundo informações do mercado, seriam a Manguinhos e a 76 Oil, ligadas à Refit (antiga Manguinhos).

 Em São Paulo, as fraudes também são concentradas em um grupo restrito de empresas, diz a Secretaria de Fazenda e Planejamento do estado. Em nota, a secretaria disse que “realiza continuamente atividades de fiscalização para bloquear a atividade de empresas com indícios de irregularidades”.

 A Plural defende uniformização das alíquotas de etanol entre os estados para reduzir o incentivo à sonegação em operações interestaduais de venda do combustível.

 Manguinhos e 76 Oil disseram que nunca tiveram produtos apreendidos pela Receita estadual e que refutam a acusação. A primeira disse que é “gravíssima a ilação” de que cometa crimes. A segunda chamou de “irresponsabilidade”.

 As duas dizem que são vítimas desse tipo de crime e que os autores são conhecidos pelo mercado. A Folha não conseguiu contato com as distribuidoras descredenciadas e com a usina Canabrava.",1572566626

Another lawyer, who I was setup through a wage theft organization, said he could represent me and take 25%.  I am scared of the challenge. I am scared of losing and feeling humiliated and broken if I do it alone.  Dang it, I wish there was a team of support I could build.  Maybe I should just hire the lawyer.  However, if I don't do this shit I won't break this fear I have of being intimidated by the system.

"Stoicism","t5_2r4kq","Stoicism isn’t really that special. Well it is special in its formulation, flavor and personalities and some specific teachings. But...

These ideas about what’s in your control vs out of your control, honor, duty, cooperation, pro activity, long term thinking, love and goodness, vice and virtue, discipline and hard work ethic. Etc...

Are concepts that essentially took human beings from hunter gatherer life into civilizations and ultimately the modern time. 

You see these ideas pop up in all kinds of forms in all the world mystical and religious and cultural traditions. 

The reason being is that those things are really the “laws of life”. 

You can’t have society with collaboration. 
You can’t succeed as a human without long term thinking. 
Etc..

I love Stoicism and the movement that’s happening today because it’s galvanizing and focusing these ideas. It’s exactly what’s missing in today’s world. 

When we stepped into the modern era, we threw away so many cultural and religious and social traditions in the name of progress.

I think we all agree that attrition is a concern, but what isnt addressed in your analysis is what the baseline attrition is. 

57%  doesn’t intuitively “feel” normal, but what is normal?  5%, 18%, 48%???

We don’t know and without that info, we can’t understand the strength of your thesis which seems to be “NU has a whole lot less talent than recruiting class rankings would lead you to believe, relative to other schools.”

Not trying to discredit the work you did, but if we’re going to have an analysis, we can’t make any findings without completing the analysis.  

My “instinct” is that 57% is higher than average and that your points are directionally correct.  But my other instinct is that NU’s struggles under Frost cannot be reduced to any single factor like roster attrition.",1572566629

Yes, that is what I meant! Depending on how the story goes, the Sonata being the key to the story can completely work and even be a pleasant twist, because even if it's foreshadowed, some readers might not realize that it's as important as it is.

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","That's a good question! I've heard of that loop but never heard how to avoid it stop it.  Our dog formed the same kind of loop around stealing things. He will get something he shouldn't have and run under-the-table with it. We tell him to ""drop it"" and when he does, we've given him a treat.  It's good that he drops all these items and doesn't try to run away from us. He just waits for the treat. We have never chased him, which is what he really wanted in the beginning. He thinks our game is more fun anyway. Now he goes in search of things that he wants to steal, runs are the table and waits patiently for us to come and take it from him. Sometimes it's things that could damage him or valuable things that we don't want destroyed. No matter how carefully we puppy proof this house, he is quite skillful at finding things he shouldn't have. If we just as much as drop a sock or a glove, hes on it faster than the speed of light and under-the-table with it.

until they work to actually hold the other's accountable and keep them out of the profession, they are complicit.  if you can't trust one, you can't trust any of them, because you don't know which is which until you're the victim.

&amp;#x200B;

that's the point.  its not a case of a few bad apples, because in this case, those bad apples have poisoned the entire system.  it is now by default all of them, because the ""good"" ones wont reprimand the bad ones, and even actively defend them.

there are good cops and bad cops as people, but the institution itself is broken.  thus, as an office, there can be no good cops until those good people in the institution fix the entire thing.",1572566631

You can't achieve anything if you constantly losing your semen, that's why there is very rare case of attractive billionaire even though being attractive is very important to get ahead in life, it also means you are smart.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If someone asks you for a tampon, even if it's your worst enemy, you give it to her. Same deal if she has blood on her pants/skirt. Even if you hate her, you go up and tell her -- ***quietly.***

You don't date -- or even flirt with -- a friend's ex without asking permission first.

If a stranger comes up and acts like a friend you haven't seen in a while, you play along. 

If you see a woman in trouble -- trying to get away from someone, looking desperately around the room --  *you* become the long-lost friend. If you misread the situation, it's nbd -- but if you're right, you could save her life. 

My technique is to chat for a few minutes in front of the guy, then ask her to come to the bathroom with me. If she doesn't need help, she can tell me there. If she does, I get her out the back door as quietly and as quickly as possible. If necessary, I go back out to my table after telling the guy  that she'll be back in a minute. That way I can keep an eye on him until I know she's clear.",1572566632

https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-release-april-2020/

Thing is while I wouldn't call the leak reliable I could actually see from software making a game like this. One thing that I really like about From Software games is how they do a great job reinforcing their narrative themes through gameplay. With the game this Elden Ring you can see a game about the damaging effects of conflict, and how even winning and supposedly gain power can actually leave you open to suffer a loss that will weaken you further, and how in order to regain something resembling your former strength you need to violently steal it from others. If it is fake however I will say gold star to the reddit user for figuring that ""arms"" actually are a big theme of the Elden Ring trailer

If you're financing it, I would say hang tight and buy the FSD down the road

"MaledomEmpire","t5_3cl02","*When witches go riding, and black cats are seen, the moon laughs and whispers, ‘tis near Halloween.*

With so many resources being put into [capturing and interrogating FRA rebels](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaledomEmpire/comments/dpmrzf/processed_the_two_detained_cunts_are_transported/) it’s just come to my attention that many of you are unaware of the Civilisation LLP, *the Empire’s Premier Value Added Slave Training Organisation*, organised “**Halloween Grindhouse Movie Marathon**”. So let me take this chance to address that (and be reassured, [the admin cunt responsible](https://i.imgur.com/ypPOAi3.jpg) has [been suitably reprimanded](https://i.imgur.com/IhSAyRH.jpg)).

The **Halloween Grindhouse Movie Marathon** features five emotive horror and exploitation movies produced in collaboration with Civilisation LLP (producers of the Empire wide smash hit “[Fall of the Cunt-vengers](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaledomEmpire/comments/a4qjqi/superheroine_movies_are_a_little_different_in_the/)”) giving directors the chance to bring their true vision to the screen, unburdened by morally corrupt Old World values and censorship (as with our [“Empire Edition” of video games](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaledomEmpire/comments/bg34wr/mortal_kunbat_while_developers_often_have_to/)). 

The running order is as follows:

Film 1: [Slasher vs Cunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaledomEmpire/comments/dpvzv9/halloween_grindhouse_movie_marathon_part_1/?)

Film 2: [Summoning the Natural Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaledomEmpire/comments/dpw706/halloween_grindhouse_movie_marathon_part_2/?)

Film 3: Blood Lust

Film 4: [Possessed by the Natural Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaledomEmpire/comments/dpwolz/halloween_grindhouse_movie_marathon_part_4/?)

Film 5:  [The Ritual Cunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaledomEmpire/comments/dpwvoe/halloween_grindhouse_movie_marathon_part_5_the/?)

For those embracing the whole movie going experience [refreshments are available](https://i.imgur.com/ZINB1h0.jpg), delivered [directly to your seat](https://i.imgur.com/KzMTgR7.jpg) so you don’t have to miss a moment of the cinematic magic on screen.

A synopsis follows below. Spoiler alert for those who wish to be fully surprised.

**Blood Lust**
-- 

When [a medic](https://i.imgur.com/U0JqsqD.jpg) takes a break from her usual activities and notices missing vials of blood she is drawn into a terrifying and erotic world of [vampire cults](https://i.imgur.com/koLvKvd.jpg) and [the addiction of slavery](https://i.imgur.com/wXMF9aY.jpg). Pursuing a mysterious hooded figure who has been seen loitering outside the clinic she discovers that the blood has been taken by a strange coven of men who possess a slave cunt of their own. Overwhelmed by the throbbing blood inside their hard cocks, she is [unable to resist](https://i.imgur.com/pEXsOxW.jpg) as they [make her their new plaything](http://cdn.pichunter.com/349/8/3498347/3498347_5_o.jpg), collaring her and [inducting her into the cult](https://i.imgur.com/YHp61bQ.jpg).

Freed from the shackles of responsibility beyond service and driven wild by the pounding, throbbing, pulsating blood in her veins [and their cocks](https://i.imgur.com/wB0XkRQ.jpg) she gets [taken deeper](https://i.imgur.com/XteCyoJ.jpg) ([and wider](https://i.imgur.com/uO8MtEG.jpg)) into the [cult's lust-fuelled orgies](https://i.imgur.com/FTxhOUS.jpg), driven [mindless with pleasure](https://i.imgur.com/rbCoRvM.jpg) on [multiple occasions](https://i.imgur.com/AYFqvfL.jpg) before, [as a cum covered mess](https://i.imgur.com/erkUPe9.jpg), she crawls into the cage to [join her sister-cunt in slavery](https://i.imgur.com/4df2rF8.jpg).",1572566635

They reduce every issue down to how it will play politically while sidestepping the questions that really fucking matter, all while failing to push back hard enough to keep their precious access to liars and propagandists. 

This model of journalism does not work in the information age, where propaganda is spread instantaneously around the globe.. It's not enough to just repeat what the politicians are saying. It only benefits the liars when they do. They have to dig in, provide context for EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF NEWS. A short hourly broadcast of what's happening is less then worthless, because it means people listening are only hearing the words of politicians spoken through ""serious"" news organizations.",1572566637

1) Bring d3 down to 2,000 iu after a break from the 10,000 iu (take in the morning)

2) Cut zinc down to 15mg after a break from the 30mg. (night)

3)Cut down magnesium to 300mg. (Night)

4)Keep the calcium and the Vitamin E complex the same (Night?)

5) Scratch the multi vitamin and add in vitamin k and a b complex instead (Morning)


Also, what else should i add? Vitamins A-C? Boron? Anything else? And at what doses? Creatine? Acetyl-l-carotine or whatever its called? 

I should add that im vegetarian (just how i was raised and now i cant stand meat even if i wanted to cuz didnt eat it for 18 years haha

I want to get all this down and start supplementing properly with it in order to give my body the core micronutrients for an optimized homeostatic baseline(assuming good sleep, stress management, exercise, and diet are good)

The airport is in Kahului.  There's a Costco right next to it.  If you're a member and you arrive during it's business hours, you can pop in and load up on snacks, drinks, and/or food on your way to the place you're staying.  

I love a good Hawaiian mixed plate.  Lots of places to eat that.  If you want something fancier, I really liked Pacific O'.  It's beachfront in Lahaina, worth the splurge.  If you go, reserve a table around sunset.

I think I've done most of the touristy things:  sunrise at Haleakala and bike ride down (whether you get the view depends on whether the weather cooperates); snorkle Molokini; drive the road to Hana; visit Lanai; ride an America's cup sail boat; explore Old Town Lahaina; ziplined; go to luau's.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Pancreatitis was no joke, had it in May, caused by a liver stone that was lodged in my duodenum. I started the week peeing brown from bile build up, the doctors were asking why I wasn't jaundiced because my liver levels were so bad, being sent home and told to make a follow up appointment, and then going back into the ER from the pancreatic pain. My wife drove me the second time, and she got hungry whilst I was in the ER room, so she went and bought Wendy's for herself as I had been vomiting out whatever was going in, and it smelled so good, those damned fries. They finally admitted me, no food for 3 days straight, no fluids, just pure IV in a intensive unit because my liver and pancreas was in trouble. I'll never forget that first glass of ice I was allowed and how wonderful broth tasted. The pain was horrible, and because I had been a addict in the past and admitted it to the doctor, I only got morphine once every 12 hours, it was hell, but I still bust my wife's chops over that Wendy's. She could've ate that in her car, I also told her if she wanted to spend time with me in the room not to bring food or drink. The pain, the hunger, and the thirst.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Uma estudante de pedagogia de 23 anos morreu após ser atropelada por um motoqueiro, por volta das 6h desta quinta-feira (31), em Francisco Morato (Grande SP). Milena Toshi iria se casar nesta sexta-feira (1º).

 O motoqueiro que atropelou a vítima, um repositor de hortifrutigranjeiros de 21 anos, também se feriu no acidente, foi socorrido, mas passa bem. 

 Segundo a polícia, a vítima ia para o trabalho, em uma escola de Franco da Rocha (Grande SP), quando decidiu atravessar a rua 21 de Março. A via, acrescentou a polícia, estava com a pista direita congestionada e a esquerda livre. “A vítima então atravessou a rua, mas não percebeu que a moto vinha na pista da esquerda”, afirmou um policial que pediu para não ter o nome publicado. 

  O motoqueiro, ainda disse o policial civil, tentou frear a moto, mas não conseguiu impedir o atropelamento da estudante. O repositor bateu a cabeça quando caiu de seu veículo. Após o acidente, ambos foram encaminhados ao hospital Lacaz, onde Milena não resistiu. O motoqueiro não apresentava sinais de embriaguez, de acordo com a polícia. 

 A rua onde ocorreu o acidente, segundo boletim de ocorrência, não conta com faixas de pedestres e tem um fluxo intenso de veículos, principalmente no horário em que ocorreu o acidente. 

 A reportagem apurou que a vítima trabalhava em Franco da Rocha desde fevereiro do ano passado. Pelo fato de a vítima ser conhecida pela pontualidade, a chefia dela a procurou, pois Milena não havia chegado ao trabalho. Por telefone, os colegas de trabalho ficaram sabendo sobre a morte da jovem. 

 ### Casamento

 Milena estava com casamento marcado para esta sexta-feira (1º). Segundo o noivo dela escreveu na internet, o casal já havia mobiliado a casa na qual iriam morar. Segundo consta em uma rede social da vítima, desde 2012 ela e o rapaz mantinham um relacionamento. 

 “Me dói tanto saber que ontem estávamos tão felizes por nossas conquistas, por nosso amor ser tão grande, por saber que amanhã iríamos realizar o nosso maior sonho que era nos casar [...] Hoje Deus tirou de mim a joia mais preciosa, aquela pessoa me confortava quando eu estava triste, que era a única coisa que me dava paz mediante a turbulência, um anjo que Deus colocou em minha vida”, diz trecho da mensagem do companheiro de Milena. 

 A polícia destacou que o motoqueiro é ""trabalhador"" e que o caso foi um ""acidente"". Ele deverá responder por homicídio culposo (sem intenção de matar).",1572566640

"weedstocks","t5_2zfqj","I like youre thinking with craft growers as well. Maybe I was a little shortsighted. I'm just very disappointed with the CDN rollout. It seems like it was set up to fail. And the argument ""It's still early"", I've grown to not like it. We're  a year in. We had 1st mover and when USA comes online, they'll swallow us. And the clock is ticking. Investments were burned. Insurance companies were burned. Because we couldn't open stores? There's no lack of supply. There's no distribution and were a year in.

I think its more likely to pass than it was a month or two ago. Pressure from the rest of the world but not Canada (lol). There was a poll out on weedstreet420 that said 52% approval rating, previous was 10 or 14. Moscow Mitch out lobbying for hemp. Bernie is very vocal. Trump can say ""me too"" and shut the dems out. It's a better situation than we could have hoped for months ago.

Not an American so not sure what other legislation you'd be thinking of. Enlighten me?

Good news is the state's are all doing their own thing and ready to go. They've got the market,infrastructure and the blueprint on what not to do. They'll play patient too though. There are a lot of weed companies in the state's right now that are in distress. So keep an eye out on the ones who are cash flow positive early doing their own thing and not jumping the gun to pay 2 to 3x BV on an asset that'll do 4x. You wanna see the book paid.

Something like 50+% of  Cannibis retaliers in Cali are under duress. Perhaps likely the well funded efficient ones step in and take them over. Something to think about. Cali market is huge but financing issue is systemic. Even for the big markets.",1572566641

I asked my then boyfriend ""do you honestly think I like my degree?"" He didn't hesitate when he said yes.

Previous performance doesn't guarantee future performance. E.g. Japan up to 1990. The idea that I keep hearing that the stock market will continue to rise, perform etc. because it always has boggles my mind when there are so many important factors that are really changing the US.

"OnePieceTC","t5_36oy2","Agreed. If I were lucky enough to pull him I think I'd also go HP over RCV. It feels like people zone in so much on that tiny bit of RCV, but fail to take into account that, realistically, in 9/10 runs you either don't take any meaningful damage at all OR you don't take any big damage before the final stage, making the RCV less valuable than the extra HP in that case since you won't have time to recover it back. 

And in that 1/10 run where you happen to take a big chunk of damage early on, I'd say there's a close to 100% likelihood that the 100 less RCV won't really mean the end of the run. Instead, I think it's way more realistic to assume that 1,000 - 2,000 less HP could be the difference between surviving a nuke or dying to it...

In any case, I think both are totally fine. It just irks me a little that most people are just like ""duh, it says RCV in their captain ability so obviously RCV"".",1572566642

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My family runs two nursing homes in Santa Rosa, CA. In October 2017, a fast moving fire tore through a large part of town, forcing them awake and making them evacuate all 12 of their elderly patients with Alzheimer's. I had to drive back home from Oakland early in the morning to help them with everything, and we had to shuttle them to and from our facilities and shelters in order to properly take care of them. One of our facilities ended up burning down, forcing us to shut down that business and send our clients elsewhere. We just went through almost the exact same thing this past week with our remaining facility, made even worse by an even larger area of evacuation causing shelters to turn people away, sending us almost three hours south. This time the fire stopped about 10 miles from our facility, and even closer to our house, but both were fortunately left unharmed. Being alone, in the dark, with six incredibly confused and upset elderly patients, while my parents surveyed the area we had to evacuate to see if we still had our livelihood, for almost six days straight, is something I hope I never have to go through again. But, with high winds becoming a new norm and the NorCal power company, PG&amp;E, simultaneously being at fault for all of it, cutting all power to large sweeping areas, and refusing to do anything past a slow 10 year revamp of their systems, it'll probably happen again in a year.",1572566644

2. There is lots on YouTube about painting models. Look at ""zenithal basecoat"" and ""drybrush"" and ""shade wash"" those are real simple methods to drastically improve the level of your paintjob. But most importantly, no matter which method you use: use less paint than you think. If you have a drop on your brush, paint will go everywhere. There are different types of paint, opaque ones can just go on top of each other, transparent ones (like Contrast) depend on the specific case, some times you want to layer them, other times you want to restart from primer.
3. Don't start with a big model, the big ones usuaslly have way more detail, so need more skill and the sheer size needs way more effort. For a new guy it can take days or even weeks to finish a Tyrant. You'll end up fustrated and disappointed with the result. Get a box of termas or hormas. You can completely paint one in an hour or two, you can try different things and don't have to worry about messing one up.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Als ich heute in den Matheunterricht kam, sah ich etwas, das mir jetzt noch ins Hirn gestanzt ist, wenn ich die Augen schließe. Jemand hatte seinen neuen Gaming Laptop mitgebracht. Der Gabelstapler, mit dem er das Teil reingebracht hatte, stand noch im Leerlauf hinten im Raum. Ich fing an zu schwitzen, als ich mich hinsetzte und das 350kg schwere Monster von einem Laptop anglotzte. Der Typ hatte seinen Schultisch bereits mit Stahlträgern gestützt und befand sich gerade auf der Suche nach einer Steckdose für ein Ladekabel vom Durchmesser eines Jumbo-Schreiner-Schenkels. Ich fange an unkontrolliert zu zittern. Ich sage mir immer und immer wieder, dass alles gut werden wird und es keinen Grund zur Sorge gibt. Doch er findet eine Steckdose. Tränen rinnen meine Wangen herunter, während ich meiner Familie ein letztes Mal schreibe, wie sehr ich sie liebe.

Der Lehrer beginnt den Unterricht und der Schüler startet seinen Laptop. Die bunten Lichter seiner RGB-Tastatur flammen auf wie ein Atomschlag im Bikini Atoll und mein Kopf wird von einem dumpfen irdischen Dröhnen erfüllt, das meine Seele in ein permanentes Zucken versetzt. Das komplette Licht der Stadt wird schlagartig dunkel. Der Klassenraum beginnt damit, ruckartig zu vibrieren, als die massiven Lüfter orkanartige Böen durch den Raum peitschen lassen. Innerhalb weniger Sekunden ist meine Welt von blühendem Leben zu einem dunklen, erderschütternden Anti-Kosmos geworden, in dem mein Körper von 240 Km/h schnellen Winden und dem 500db Jaulen der Laptop-Lüfter auseinandergerissen wird. Als mein Körper endlich aufgibt, schluchze ich ein letztes Mal auf, während meine Schule und die gesamte Stadt in den Äther gezogen werden. Ich hasse Gaming Laptops verdammtnochmal.",1572566645

Of course this doesn't make it good or fine by any means and it's more than safe to say that tabbaco products are harmful. Another important thing to add is that most of the cancer causing toxins are due to the fermentation.

&gt;Though few mention it, subtracting Harper, while it will cost 34 homers, a .899 career OPS and some amazing hair flips, would help any team improve its attention to fundamentals. When the most famous player on the team can’t go 10 days without failing to run out a groundball or overthrowing a cutoff man by 15 feet or throwing to the wrong base or being caught unprepared in the outfield or on the bases, it’s hard to demand total alertness from the other 24.

For me, i went for third party, fire and theft cover over the fully comp because the way I looked at it was, if I was in the car and had an accident without the accompanied driver I wasn't insured anyway! That was my personal opinion anyway.

I think starting off I paid €1300 but again, that was 5 years ago. My advice would be, definitely go out on your own for your insurance if possible, you'll build up your no claims bonus for yourself this way. 

Try them all. I'm with AXA now and was able to get mine just under €1000 this year for TPFT. 

Thirdly, and this is gonna sound stupid, do and pass your test ASAP. My insurance dropped to €800 when I rang them to tell them I passed.

"MouseReview","t5_2vlxi","Yeah Relaxed claw is more accurate; palm on, fingers bent. 360/cm is basically the same as yours (*again* haha) on my normal OW eDPI, 4000. I use a Zowie PSR, a slow pad that's 34.5cm, and my 360 is slightly more than that, which is fine since you're mostly 180ing in that game anway. Yeah testing was basically how many targets I could hit in whatever amount of time using McCree; it's not scientific but I was always able to hit more with the Skoll in the same amount of time - even though the sensor position of the GMO makes it faster, it also made it harder to control, so there was definitely more inaccuracy vs the Skoll. 

I definitely want to try a wireless ergo ultralight, which I think would be the best of all worlds if it was the right shape. I think it's telling that was there no notable performance increase for you with the GPW vs the 403, since I was under the assumption that was almost the objectively better mouse (lighter, wireless), which definitely gives credence to the argument that shape/comfort is just as, if not more important, than other features a mouse has.",1572566647

However, I definitely feel the opposite so it's unpopular to someone at least. I just feel that traditions and ""events"" like this are meant to be passed down to different generations and celebrated in different ways depending on the person. Kids (up to highschool) should be the only ones going around asking for candy, sorry if you disagree but that's my opinion. Kids have a whole event, maybe friend they're excited to go with, and a non-clouded view of what they're experiencing. They take in the atmosphere and experience new things, then get candy as a reward for joining the spirit or being brave in the face of fear. Anybody highschool and older should definitely know better. Middle school is cutting it close, but those are the times where you go with just your friends and whatnot. Highschool and up, all you're doing is pushing young kids aside so you can have your own fun which I never feel is right. Imagine going to a house known for really good candy and taking the last of their candy only to have a group of kids come by and realize they missed out as they didn't know and knocked the rest of the houses first. Bullshit if someone says ""I'd give them mine"". My little cousin almost missed an easter egg last year because a bunch of older kids decided to group up and get a bunch of eggs despite everyone knowing only the kids did it.

If you had strike exclusive loot in D1 for example, why is it not really in D2?

If you can make one thing an ornament, why not all armor?

Where's the armor design quality from D1?

You can do all of these things AND also sell super cool, expensive things in an MTX store.  Especially for the size of your company.  I can't understand for the life of me how such a massive operation is so limited in creativity.  To the point of re-skinning raid armor!!!  How about hiring some more people to make some actual loot in a looter shooter?  

I'm sure there are many passionate devs at Bungie.  Problem is, the ones making decisions have very little interest in good product first, profit follows.  You guys have always come off as super calculating and on-message, no matter how many times you feign transparency and passion.

There is an actual reason people feel this way.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","They focus in efficiency rather than equity; that’s beneficial for a 1-2% of the population in America?: the owners of big companies, that basically, have got all the power and money of the country. For the bast majority, it means less rights in the workplace (for example, non-paid vacations), no health care, no good-quality public education (that means not having equal opportunities) and the list goes on. Also the society is in constant fear, because of the simple access to weapons, they spend most of their taxes in security/ military but they have a mentality of fear. Another thing is the nutrition, it’s so fucked up, people mostly eat hyper-processed food, with tons of additives, salt and most importantly sugar.

"television","t5_2qh6e","The Convington Catholic kids were victims of racial abuse from *three different parties*, and all of those parties were given a completely free pass. 

The first party were the Black Israelites who were screaming abuse at them. None of these racial justice crusaders even *tried* to find the names of these people. Their pictures aren't on the internet. They weren't doxxed or sent death threats or fired from their jobs. All the initial reports *conveniently* deleted that portion of the video. 

The second party was Nathan Phillips who, *in his own words*, said that he saw a commotion and went over because he assumed the white kids were being racist, just because they were white. *""It looked like these young men were going to attack these guys. They were going to hurt them. They were going to hurt them because they didn't like the color of their skin.""* Nathan Philips, it turns out, was a piece of shit who lied about his military history, was thrown out of the military for being a degenerate alcoholic, and he was paraded around as a hero. The racial justice crusaders didn't dig up his history, it was the people defending the Covington Catholic boys who had to do it, who found out he was a liar, and that his entire motivation was because he saw a bunch of white kids are literally just assumed they were going to attack and beat up black people.

Lastly, the boys were a victim of racial prejudice from people like you. Because they were clearly victims who did nothing wrong, and yet you savagely attack them and wrote paragraphs of rationalizing death threats against them. You see black people, white people, and native people, and you automatically hone in on the whites just because they're white. That's you being a fucking racist, but you can't even see it. You literally think when non-whites are being openly racist, it's actually not as bad as when white people do something that requires a team of scientists and a congressional investigation to unearth something that could possibly be maybe considered slightly racist by one person somewhere.

And ultimately, after you gave the black Israelites a free pass, and Nathan Philips a free pass, you gave yourself a free pass, because you consider yourself a pious crusader for social justice, so when you do things wrong, ""it actually was because I was secretly correct anyway"". You'll always find some way to rationalize your psychotic antisocial behaviors. 

Keep gazing long into that shit-abyss, you racist.",1572566655

"Reds","t5_2sbv5","Alright, name players who would fit those roles and are available that would provide as much of an upgrade to the Reds as Grandal would. 

Let me help a bit. Ozuna wouldn't. Jose Iglesias (lol) wouldn't. Did wouldn't. Puig wouldn't. Rendon would, but he's more expensive than Grandal will be. Castellanos might (altho he probably wouldn't), but he's likely just as expensive as Grandal, is more inconsistent, *and* is bad defensively.

Speaking of catchers... Guess who the second best catcher is in baseball (and the best one actually available)? 

Yea. It's Grandal.

So many Reds fans are just spouting off about how ""the money"" could be used on better things but they don't have any actual concrete ideas other than some nebulous ""find players at *these* positions that are good and sign them!"" Well, Grandal is a player at a position of need for the Reds, and y'all are bitching because he's 31 as though there are good players in their early 20s that hit free agency.

EDIT: Let me actually take back the Didi comment. Peak Didi would be as big of an upgrade for the Reds as Grandal.

Even playing simple rhythms as tight as possible (straight 8th notes, for example) will grant you the ability to move on to more difficult rhythms (syncopated/dotted 16th notes, for example). Believe it or not, disco music helped me with this immensely. That’s all those guys did during that era was straight forward rhythms on one or two chords and they were tight as all shit. For more difficult rhythms, James Brown guitar stuff is critical (Jimmy Nolen, Catfish Collins). It repeats the exact same thing over and over and over and over and over for 6 minutes (that’s funk baby) and it really lets you hone in and clean up your timing and feel",1572566657

"owenbenjamin","t5_3pcw7","Leftism is the opposite of free markets and liberty. Its government control. Whether you want to call that socialism, democratic socialism, communism, whatever, theres little difference. The countries that have benefited from leftism are pretty few and far between, and they are all filled with a homogeneous population with a hard working culture. Do I think some leftist/liberal policy is a good thing? Sure. I think full blown libertarianism is retarded. But the liberals and the leftists are both fighting the same battle, the battle to end the free market and freedoms. You'll notice how the working class has moved away from leftist policy and now supports free markets because theyve been proven to work better, despite having their flaws. I use the terms left/right for simplicity sake, I dont want to write a paragraph everytime politics get brought up. And I will choose the neocons every time over the leftists, as much as I hate neocons. I'm a Milton Friedman guy, not a Noam Chomsky guy.

Would you like to spend 30 million dollars not addressing homelessness so that we don't give free hand outs? Or would you rather spend 20 million addressing homelessness and giving free hand outs.

There is no, save 30 million dollars and leave it alone option. You have spend more money doing nothing, and less money doing something.

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Really depends. Openpyxl is a very mature library (Excel driver for pandas), and the documentations are very well organized and maintained. Everything you do in openpyxl is very ""pythonic"". 

Other libraries such as xlwing, which is a wrapper based on pywin32 (win32com) simplifies the usage but lack many features. Win32com, which allows you to directly access dll to reference to an com application so you can access the entire object model, but the down side is the lack of documentations. 

I started with VBA development so I prefer to work the object model directly, thus, I choose win32com as my main library when working with office applications such as Excel, Word, Outlook, even Photoshop.

The biggest difference between win32com and openpyxl is one directly access the data model, the other one opens an Excel, paste the data/chart/pivot table/etc, then close the file.

One more thing, win32com works on Windows only. I think openpyxl works with both Windows and Mac (and you don't need to have Excel installed).",1572566661

Williams just accused their doctors of missing the fact that he had cancer. That implies one of two things, or both: the doctors are incompetent, or they lied to him. Are the Redskins supposed to just sit there and listen to all of that shit they're getting? They are simply investigating what happened. Would you rather just randomly trust that Williams is telling the truth, or would you rather an investigation show you the absolute truth of what happened?

If the doctors missed it, then so be it. Shit happens and I'm sure the appropriate measures will be taken, but there's a decent chance that the tumor wasn't harmful at that time (6 years ago) and that Williams wasn't diligent enough in getting it checked regularly.",1572566662

 Just download some basic interface first from the other console, select your character and the host selects the track/level or sth. Then only the selected stuff would be sent from the host and that's it. 

The problem would be with deciding what stuff to send over, because if it isn't just one bigger level file with everything, but a small file with tons of dependencies on other small files, then you would have to download most of the game anyway to play just a bit of it.

 A solution to this could be special lower detail versions of the maps and streaming the less important things in the background from the host, but that is kinda too much work to do for games already released on the switch. Maybe next time ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",1572566662

Has Sinterklaas contributed to segregation? Ironically not until the protests started.


I take my son to the Sinterklaas festivities. If there’s Black Pete, I care just as little as when there’s a Rainbow Glitter Pete. Neither of them will negatively affect my sons development.

Me and 2 other housemates moved into a 3 bedroom condo recently. We all have boyfriends over but one girl basically moved her bf in from the get-go, not on lease, rent free. He works but no school so he was actually here more than her and he’s messy and disrespectful. 2 weeks ago we tell her he can’t live here and she plays dumb. So we said he can’t have all his stuff here, no key, no being here alone.

So all his stuff is still here, still lives here, but he’s (almost) never here w/o her. Does his laundry here, gets packages here, today he left his empty amazon package/trash on the living room floor so I texted her saying, “hey it looks like X never moved out despite our last discussion, we see his package here too, can we talk about this in person?”

She says, well he doesn’t have a key and isn’t here alone anymore, I thought that was the issue. I have too much to deal with so actually he’ll be staying home from now on.

I insist that we should talk in person and she insists that there’s nothing to talk about, she doesn’t want to take time out of her day to make it a big deal so he’s just never gonna come over again.

So I left it at that. She insists he’s not gonna come over again and I expect her to stick with it. Me and other roommate will continue to have our boyfriends visit occasionally. AITA?

&gt;No hate bro but , this is a Classic example of FOMO.Please be careful brother.

No offense taken :)

Where is the FOMO though? Noone knows whats happening tomorrow, so some of us pick an average case that has reasonable returns - which is to invest regularly each month, aka SIP. If it goes up, good. If it goes down, I get units for cheaper. As long as it's going up in the long term sense, I'm good. 


&gt;I agree but the data shows sip do not necessarily beat the market &amp; the returns vary vastly depending upon when you start your sip.There's a great video on this topic on freefincal.

SIP is just a style, it has no reason to beat or not beat the market. I am salaried, so I lumpsum my savings each month into funds, that's my SIP. If I only invest in index funds, then I match the market. If I don't then I may either lose to or beat the market. Fwiw, I have a significant share of smallcaps in my current portfolio and so underperformance wrt the nifty50 of last year is a given. That said, all my Indian funds have beaten their respective benchmarks. 

There have been long periods in history where equities have returned even negative returns. Still, for a salaried person with no spare lump sum available the sip is the best option available. We can't change the timeline we live in, so sip or not, the equity returns are linked to the market (and I don't have much of a specific idea how that's going to pan out in the next 20.or so years). 

I maintain my sips as usual, with a recent tweak to be a little heavier towards debt than before.

&gt;I made 7% XIRR last year in debt funds but without my portfolio ulcer index going up.

A note on the ulcer index - identical stock market movements don't cause identical ulcers in two different people. Different people have different thresholds for what they consider as acceptable risk. I'd say I didn't get any ulcers either, and I hold about 30% of equity funds as smallcaps. (for full disclosure, my curent portfolio is 40:60, moving towards 70:30) :)

Interac is a for profit company but the big banks &amp; Desjardins owns it, so really they're the shareholders. It makes no sense for them not to use Interac to facilitate interbank networks. If they were to build their own solution, it will cost them money as well. Also, Interac eTransfers existed way before Interac became a private for profit company.",1572566666

That's very much what's happening in vaporwave, except the ""amateurs"" are using laptops instead of acoustic guitars, and instead of ballads about sailing or farming, they're songs about working in an office or growing up in the 1980s, etc.",1572566668

Definitely find out for sure about the pregnancy, but either way you will need to talk with your bishop. Don't stress about it! Trust me, you will feel much better about it after. Your bishop is not required to ask you for explicit details. You just need to talk to him about your concerns and he will make some suggestions that will help you to get back on track and feel better. He's also not allowed to divulge your information to anyone, so don't even worry about that. I really hope everything works out for the best. Just don't dwell on this; the sooner you act on it the better you will feel. :) Feel free to PM if you need to talk.",1572566669
"slaythespire","t5_3hbbd","Don't use Websites with guides for STS. Also don't pay attention to spirelogs if you want to improve your game. Spirelogs is interesting and cool to check out but it won't help you becoming better at the game - it will probably make you worse at Spire. For advice just use this subreddit, for educational content watch some of those long-ass jorbs videos on his youtube channel. That's all you need to progress and learn. I can guarantee you that on A8 RNG doesn't fuck you over, it's the player/you. Keep in mind that every decision you've made during a run leads to your death and not just that one bad draw/encounter. Dying to this one encounter in Act 2 or 3 is a product of all the decisions you made; maybe you played your hands incorrectly a couple of floors earlier and lost too much HP, maybe you picked the wrong card reward several times. The paths you chose aren't optimal, you anticipated the damage taken incorrectly etc. There is SO much to pay attention to if you want to play STS at its best - it's perfectly normal to not understand all of this stuff at A8. Just keep grinding and pay attention to EVERYTHING. You have a lot of control in Spire, more control than most other roguelikes. All this control gives you enough tools to overcome the variance eac h run offers you at your Ascension level. Good luck!",1572566669

Hillary Clinton absolutely would have gone to prison had she been lower-middle ranking military personnel for the security breach. Cheney is worse, by far, than everyone I have mentioned combined.

Airka has forgotten many thing, most of Dio's viampire abilities, Fugo and a whole lot more, but he has forgetten an entire arc an important arc, as Koichi got act 2 in the Yukako arc, but Arika doesn't seem to remember act 2 ether as act 1 and 3 get used more. But I am not going rant about the Yukako arc, I would  rant about the Cinderella arc. first I will record the amout of time Koichi and Yukako apologies (in any context throughout the arc, so they could apologize to random people and I would count that)

Apology count

Yukako:

manga: 2

anime: 0

Koichi:

Manga: 1

Anime: 1

so in the manga Yukako apologies to Koichi once (over something in the cinderella arc) and before that she apologies to some [unnamed character](https://mangapark.net/manga/jojos-bizarre-adventure-part-4-diamond-is-breakable/i682012/v37/c349/1), in both the manga and the anime Koichi, apologies to Yukako, over a stomach ache, for eating some ice cream dish to fast (no dignity), but this point I would have bought up the Yukako arc but Aya has alluded to it and countless people have already used it, so I would alluded to it but just by complaining on how she never apologize for it, Koichi said to her he has gotten past it, so why didn't say just at least say ""sorry"". Also she still acted like a complete psycho, case in point, the traffic light scene. But to give credit where credits due, blind Koichi would be kind off cool, it could enchase echoes since Koichi would have to be reliant on sound, and his stand is a sound/word stand and he would look more like Kakyoin. But sadly we didn't get blind Koichi. On a final note, I would like too see more canon competition between Rohan and Yukako over Koichi.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","That last point is crucial. It's okay for a GM to want their players to read in preparation. It's okay for players to not want to read in preparation. However, problems arise when those two groups try to play in the same game and neither is prepared to compromise. 

In the OP's situation, you can either run games that don't require the players to preread, you can try to incentivise them into prereading, or you can find new players whose preferences align with your own. What you don't get to do is complain after the millionth time that they didn't read your prereading, when you full well knew after the other 999 999 times that they wouldn't. Work out a way to compromise with the players you have, or find new players.

It's also a lot harder to change other people than it is to change yourself, so if you're not wanting to change your players you should probably focus on finding a type of game you're happy to run that's well suited for your players. One of these days I'd love to run really open, sandbox, lore-heavy world where the players feel the repercussions of their actions ripple through the setting. That's not the game for my current group though. I like the group of guys I play with, but our sessions are on the short side and always lean towards a lighter, at times outright silly tone. Attendence isn't consistent, and I cannot rely on any prereading. So, I spent some time thinking about what I had to work with, and came up with a superhero campaign. Each session would have a clearly focused goal - respond to a threat - which makes the most of limited time. The heroes themselves can cover a wide range of tones, so each player can pick their personal tone. Attendence isn't an issue - not every hero is available to respond to every issue. And the default setting is reality; apart from things they get told in session, they can assume the real world applies. Is it the campaign I most wanted to run? No. Is it a lot of fun to run? Absolutely. Starting by clearly stating what does work for your players and then coming up with something you like targeted at that will generally make for a far better experience than just trying to run the game you want to run, unless you've gone searching for the right kinds of players for the game you want to run.",1572566673

"TEFL","t5_2qq76","Ultimately it depends on which company/school you go with. Essentially you'll have to leave the country if on a tourist visa and re-enter, or wait a month or so while your work permit processes. Most chains require a passport from specific countries for the work permit. MovetoVietnam.com has good information regarding the business visa. Essentially a business visa allows you to work while waiting for the work visa/permit. Moreover, British citizens for instance can legalize documents through a governmental legalization department in London. Most likely legalization is through a governmental dept in other countries as well.

During the CELTA program at Language Link (Hanoi) they made it clear to us that we had to either wait for a work permit or leave the country and re-enter on a business visa if we signed on. That was in 2012, and most countries in SE/E Asia have tightened immigration laws a bit since then.

No doubt some mom and pop places will hire people illegally. None the less, packets from VUS, ILA, and Apax are suggesting the business visa (a DN visa) route.

*Here's a message from ILA (one of the big chains). Other companies seem to follow this procedure:*

""Overseas hires: ILA will arrange you a business visa (three months, single-entry) once we get your flight details. We will send you a visa letter (it usually takes 15 days for processing) that you can use to collect a visa on arrival upon landing. If you need a multiple entry business visa on arrival, ILA can arrange it but you must notify early, and pay the difference (usually $35-45)

Fee: Visa letter (3 months, single): $60, stamping fee at airports: $25 Full-time Teachers: Submit the visa on arrival receipt to HR for reimbursement (taxable income). You yourself pay for the following visas if you don’t have your work permit. Part-time Teachers: deducted from wages.""

*This is the classification system for typical visas:*

""A work visa is called **LĐ visa**. After having a work permit, you will receive a work visa that  allows the holder to live legally for up to one year or until the end of a teaching contract. You can renew your work visa in Vietnam if your contract and work permit are still valid.

A business visa is called **DN visa** for people who would like to go to Vietnam for a short duration for business. After the short duration, you must do a visa run if you don't have your work permit. (This explains more about the application procedures: http://www.e-vietnamvisa.com/vietnam-business-visa.html)

A tourist visa is called **DL visa** for people who want to enter Vietnam temporarily for tourism only. If you get a 3-month tourist visa, you must do a visa run in order to change the visa category into a business visa (DN).""",1572566673

And was only allowed to go out to buy food and get water as she got older. As his mother got weaker, She allowed the boy to finally explore. And so he did. Eventually. He found the city of winterhold. Cold and hungry. He saw a giant building. Naturally intrigued. He pushed through the pain of the chill and an empty stomach. He bumped into an elven woman running away, And was asked to hide a book from a few of the other mages there. He did so. And then eventually joined the college. However, His lust for power grew with each passing day, Until he began delving into Necromancy. Everyone at the college accepted it with open arms. But the necromancy took a toll on his mental health. He left the college for an old cave. And eventually became a lich.  Never truely recognising his true potential.

&amp;#x200B;

The assassin on the other hand. Was always a well liked child back in his youth. And before he became a member of the dark brotherhood. He helped sell food and mead to eager customers. His first kill, however. Changed his live for the worst. A few weeks after his 19th birthday He had found out that an older fellow had always been annoying his crush. Catching him in the act. He did something drastic and smacked the man. To which he was smacked back. Harder, And hissed at.. In a spur of anger. He pulled out a dagger from his belt. and slit the old man's throat with it. Watching him bleed to death. Before recoiling after he'd realised what he did. After a few sleepness months. He woke up in an abandoned, Rotting shack. And was given the option to kill someone. Or leave. Fearing for his life. He killed one of the people, Sweating. And with shaky hands. He was then given the passcode to the dark brotherhood sanctuary. And a key to the abandoned shack. His life hadn't changed too much since then. Aside for the whole assassination thing.

I am tentatively in the a) group. Christ is my closest friend. But that revelation didn't come about from the force fed interpretations that believers like you are quick to deny, but then insist upon when faced with a decision.

I've already said the only thing that didn't fit in so well was Black Arrow. It WAS a buffed shot, but it was more abstract than Serpent Sting and Explosive Shot. I have zero issue with rebranding it to something else. But if we honest-to-god threw out ranged Survival because ONE ability was slightly out of line then that's even more outrageous than we originally thought. Like I said in the other post, the manual directly supports the concept of magic-imbued shots which is what Survival's toolkit was. It does not support a Hunter that avoids using a ranged weapon, period. It also describes pets as ""loyal companions"", by the way, and then the class offers us the BM spec, so trying to divorce the concept of ""beast companion"" just to make SV not look like a poor man's BM is further proven to be a farce.

"HistoryMemes","t5_2v2cd","No no no, I'm not saying European Christians aren't real Christians, and no I'm not a Christian myself. I'm saying statistically, someone who identifies as Christian in Western Europe (mainly, Communism took a tole on Eastern Europe and hardened the Resolve of those Christians that remained, or in the case of Poland drove more people to it.) is less likely to act or live like a Christian. This is shown in several manners. One would be the growing irreligion in the continent, countries like Czechia and Estonia are already majority irreligious and it's growing rapidly in a lot of Europe. The devout don't convert to irreligion. Another way is by first hand account. My old French Teacher grew up in Belgium and visited France often, and according to him ""Churches are ghost towns in Europe. You will not see anybody there except during times like Christmas"". Admittedly, Church attendance is not a tenant of the faith and some branches explicitly state it is not required. However, in my experience most of those who do not regularly attend are not the most devout in their faith, but I do acknowledge they do not represent all who act in that way. My point is from a statistical one, not a religious gatekeeper one. I didn't mean to sound like I was snubbing true European Christians.",1572566683
"forhonor","t5_38p4n","The devs are seem pretty positive of continuing. Otherwise they would had not added spectator mode if they end the game next year, all the other customization stuff and the testing grounds which will be updated from time to time.

Ubi is pretty consistant of updating their Live service games, because it is cheaper than making new game and they can shift people around for bigger updates and shift people to other projects and games when the job is done. They have done this with siege for long time.

They propably have realized that For Honor is smaller game (but still larger than other fighting games) so they will keep up the support so long as there are players = paying customers. They also propably know that there are not many games like this in  the market, so they have a good ground to stand right now.

"Blizzard","t5_2r21e","You aren't missing much. It's just the same copy paste clickbait we've seen 2 dozen times already. Here's the part where they explain the incident.

&gt; the company banned a professional Hearthstone player earlier this month for supporting pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. 

Absolutely no other context given as to what occurred, no mention of when or where it happened, why they were banned. They treat it as a given fact that the ban was a direct result of pressure from Beijing. I think you can extrapolate the tone of the article from this.

I did think the last sentence was telling, though.

&gt; After all, American basketball fans largely seemed to react to the N.B.A.’s Chinese capitulation with a collective shrug, as have customers of American airlines, electronics companies and hotel chains that caved to Chinese pressure. 

One could guess from this that perhaps the gaming community is alone in being very politically active and ready to jump to the aid of the innocent! I'd argue it's much more likely that this is a community suffering from chronic FOMO that craves drama and getting one over on the corporations. Being angry at large developers is like heroin for a gamer. I don't think this has anything to do with China or Hong Kong at all.",1572566685

"dayton","t5_2rlxw","Do you have a duplex in mind already ? The age of the furnace, i.e. the efficiency of it, will have a HUGE factor on your gas bill. Consider budget billing because your bill in the summer will probably be sub-$40 (only usage would be a gas water heater unless your stove/oven is gas) and that $40 is almost all ""delivery"" charge. That charge is a fixed amount per month of around $35. We've had a gas bill with that $35 charge with $2-3 of actual gas ""usage"" !! Then in the winter, in case the furnace is older, budget billing will keep you from seeing drastically different monthly rates.

Is the AC via ""central air"" or window units ? If the window units are 220v, that helps keep the cost lower but they might not be common in an apartment/duplex since most people buy 120v units.

As the others have pointed out, the trash/water bill is billed every (3) months by Dayton, not monthly. I have email records (of payments) but they're from 6 years ago and with a family of 5, i.e. lots of clothes washing and baths/showers, I see (3) bills for $97 and some change.

Once I get on full time in my service I’ll be right around $40k in a service that does 3000 runs a year with 2 full time, 1 part time ambulance...so I may do 3 or 4 runs a day, may do 10, may do 0.  In 20 years I can retire with lifetime insurance benefits. And my pay is on par with the median salary for my town. If I go for my medic, that’s another 10k a year.

For me it works, because I’m likely to get 6-8 hours of sleep on shift and be ready for the next 2 days off. But right up the road is a bigger city that pays a buck or two more and you’re likely to do 20+ runs per shift.  I wouldn’t survive there.

"AMA","t5_2r4eo","Honestly reading through the comments and your replies are a bit suspicious. 1) I’ve never seen a single college student act as you described. Like sure people can be dick heads but to go as far as saying “you’re ugly and should get a nose job” or to “push you against the wall and try to take off your nails polish”. Especially considering the fact that you said it’s an advanced class where most of the “bullies” are filtered out. 2) You mentioned the fact that they are jealous of your accomplishments at that age and that you’re taking the same courses as them but at a younger age. I am just making assumptions here but is it possible that you are acting in a way that sort of makes you seem like a pretentious asshole? Not saying you’re but that could be the cause of the bullying. 3) The fact that a girl pushed you and tried to remove your nail polish. No 18+ college student in their right mind would do that but lets assume it did happen. There is hundreds of resources on campus and off campus that this incident could be reported to and definitely the police. 



In conclusion this whole scenario is either bullshit and you’re just karma whoring or it defies all the odds and it’s true and you’re just not reporting it. Which you should or it will escalate. I am thinking it’s more likely the first scenario and here is why. I got my Associate’s degree at 17 and started taking college courses before turning 15. I transferred to 3 different school through my undergrad/grad studies and have been always 2-4 years younger than my peers. Not a single person has shown any jealousy or treated my differently. They actually find it rather cool and only when I became close with them that they would make jokes about how I am to young to understand something. It was the same across all the schools I went to. People in college couldn’t give two shits about you’re age and accomplishments and I highly doubt that they will start doing shit that can land them in jail over jealousy. Or at least in my case. Also if this bullying is happening in multiple classes then it most likely has to do with you and the way you act. So if I am wrong and this is true (which I am like 99% sure it is not) then report it to the right people and stand up for yourself.",1572566689

I have like 50,000 right now so I could easily roll over 100 times... and assuming I sell the rolls for 100 each I'll get 10,000 for 20 more... then 2,000 for 4....

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Hey, quite a young lady is here. I don’t really think that it’s actually a problem, judging from out of the situation, though I perfectly understand what you should feel, being inside. I think that it’s a very good symptom you decide to change this aspect of your life, and I do believe that your personal tendency to have a change is decisive, as it is in everybody’s social life. That’s all about the desire from both sides, so great we come to have it at least from one.  It’s sad to say this, but i don’t think that any sort of instruction like “how to find your once life time love” really exists, and even worse everybody is unique so you have to learn how to identify which person among many others is “yours”, how to develop a relevant “strategy” of communication for everyone you would like to have relationship with, no matter a girl or a boy. But at the same time, it’s really not that difficult, just give yourself some time  to get used to being more social, don’t let anyone discourage you, just analyze your actions and learn from mistakes, and more important: try to be yourself (though it may seem somewhat trite, I do really believe that it’s the best way to feel yourself at the right place), to be honest with people (to a degree where it doesn’t overstep your private bounds), to find those who you really respect, like to be with, understand on some other and more deep level. And as soon as you’ve adjusted to being somewhat social it will come to be a way more natural and intuitive. As for your appearance and all that stuff, that’s great you want to improve, but don’t forget that you should do it mainly for your health/mentality/mood and definitely not to gain someone’s respect/friendship/love and etc. I don’t think that appearance means that much from the perspective of relationship, girls just prefer boys to be kind with them, to be thoughtful and perceptive, to share their interests, and simply to be loving.

Much of what they have lost is of questionable strategic value and marginal benefit to the whole. Time will tell but Abbadon may have won the battle only to lose the war by creating the Rift.

I'm, for some reason, particularly partial to his *Explorer* class recon scout.  It's definitely an offbeat design, but typical of his work, blends very well with the TOS Movie era aesthetic.  Unfortunately no one seems to have made a physical model, but hope springs eternal.

I may sporadically post other non-canon ships, and certainly encourage everyone to share their own non-official favorites.

"FTC","t5_2sks6","I have been mentoring junior high FTC teams for 3+ years.  Each year we take away some lessons learned - things not to do again.

The lesson the very first year was never use direct drive drivetrain - and don't mount wheels cantilevered, and don't use side motor clamps on spur gear (offset shaft) motors.

BTW:

2nd year was don't put load directly on servo splines - I still have to drive this one home with students and mentors - and they still do it.

3rd year was not to use janky arms that break easily and are hard to control in pitch.

And across a few seasons, a recurring theme is to use a touch-it-own-it intake.  I've nearly gone crazy after 3 years of manually controlled grippers and such.  For some reason, early season suggestions don't take with the students - but it is their bot and their learning process, so I bite my tongue and go along with it.",1572566694

it’s even common for most peoples’ first time smoking wax to result in a green out, because wax contains higher THC percentages, which can mean getting too high. 

the next time you smoke, take it slowly and hit by hit. it’s likely that your tolerance went way down, and you’re just going to have to build it up again! when you smoke, make sure you’re drinking enough water as well. good luck! (:",1572566695

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",1572566695

"Sprint","t5_2qibp","Verizon has good LTE coverage and speeds are good too. But for God's sake, don't go to Verizon to experience 5G. Verizon's mmWave coverage is very very small. There is no building penetration, the signals don't even penetrate windshield in a car. Although, you could look up their website and find out where 5G exisits and then play a fun game of actually locating that, because there is no coverage map. Their 5G buzzword 'built right' is laughable at best, and is outright misleading to their customers.

If you want to get meaningful 5G coverage, Sprint is pretty much the only option at this point of time. Not because Sprint has gotten awesome suddenly, but because of its mid-band spectrum (2.5 GHz), which has the right mix of coverage and capacity. Recently I read some reports by RootMetrics, PC Mag, P3 - all confirm that. Unfortunately 5G is limited to few markets, until the merger decision.

Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile - all are desperate to get the C-Band spectrum. Unfortunately it is currently being used by satellite TV providers I believe, and not gonna happen anytime soon. WSJ recently made a video about this.",1572566697

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Without knowing what you've tried, it's hard to be certain what should be investigated next, but here's some things that have worked well for me:

* Attend Conferences: ideally, ones about topics that interest you. I'm fond of the BSD, Linux, and infosec focused conferences, but I know there's some others for various platforms and languages so see what's coming up and get to whatever the most affordable and interesting upcoming conference is. Then make sure you talk to people, chat with any vendors to see what they do and if they might be looking for skills you have. Attend talks that sound interesting, but most importantly **TALK TO PEOPLE**. Attend the social events! It won't always get you closer to a job, but it ensures you're still learning and gives you precious opportunities to build your professional network.

* Get on github, I don't care how anemic your current portfolio may be, start putting out some code that demonstrates you can actually do things. HR may care about your degrees, but the only things that matter in this field is if you can get the job done and if you're not an asshole (at least, it's mostly these two things). 

* You went to a webdev bootcamp, build a website to sell your skills on! It's extremely inexpensive to get a VPS you can stand up a webserver on to both show off what you know and build your brand some! This may not help as much, but you can blog about your projects on github to show your ability to communicate and the depth of your knowledge in these topics. As an example of what I mean, check out this extremely simple [site](https://exile.digital/projects/bsd/obsd/fwproxy.html).

* Set up a profile on [Dice](https://dice.com), I get far too many emails for various positions now just because I took the time to enumerate my skillset. Hopefully starts bringing in cool jobs for you too. I have no affiliation with Dice, but I seriously get an average of 2 emails/day about some position or another.

* Join online communities. Obviously this counts, but also on places like IRC, Telegram,  Slack, or whatever else. They'll help keep you sharp and can always surprise you with the connections you can make.

To top it all off, contact your bootcamp! Leverage what contacts they have to help get you doing something fun!",1572566697

It can obviously cause sever issues long term.

This cop was waaaaay to close and had no reason whatsoever to spray this dude.

With that being said. Thus guy took that spray like a champ.

1. Spinal tap with residual cerebral spinal fluid leakage, resulting in the absolute worst headaches i've ever, ever encountered. Going to the bathroom was nighmare, i couldn't even lay on a pillow. If my skull wasn't perfectly level with the rest of my spine, i felt like someone was flossing my brain with barbed wire. As long as i remained perfectly level, and still, it was bearable, however. Wish they'd given me a catheter...  
2. Auto-injector needle strike in one of the nerves in my left arm. Easily way more pain than i thought i human could experience. Could not stop myself from shouting in pain. There was just nothing i could do to contain it, so i shoved a t-shirt in my mouth so i can yell as much as i like without disturbing the neighbors. Went in the shower and poured straight cold water down my arm, and it still felt like it was burning off.

I was always an exempt employee (treated like management), which was bad news in terms of hours. Lots of evenings and weekends. It really sucked when my daughter was young and I was too exhausted to engage with her. Think it's a common experience.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","Well you would need to consider how many places are viable to do this to begin with right?  I live in a place that is all hydro power but we also have the unique luxury if having a north flowing river of huge volume with no significant population living at the mouth of it so lets say if a dam collapsed, it wouldn't storm down the river and destroy the large metropolitan area that usually exist at the mouth of the rivers.  Hydro is good where it can be used but it can't be used in too many places across the world which is why it makes up about 15%  of the worlds energy.  

If people really want to replace energy with non CO2 emitting sources, then people should focus more on loosening up the artificial chokehold put on nuclear power.  It's the safest form of energy ever created, the cheapest ever created (its cost is inflated by impossible factors of safety required.  For example, they constantly have goals of making it hundreds of times safer, when the death toll from in American history is literally zero for commercial power plants) is the most energy dense ever discovered, and is the cleanest ever created.  It requires the least amount of raw materials of any energy source and produces the least amount of waste.  

IIRC the best batteries on the market today have an energy to weight ratio about 4% of what oil has, and nuclear is 1 to 2 million times more energy dense than oil is.  We all can name every nuclear incident ever, for example, three mile island in the United States, but what they never mention about three mile island is that there were literally zero deaths associated with it and the radiation levels aren't even at harmful levels unless people consider bananas to be dangerous to consume. For whatever reason, the term renewables is specific to sources that are unreliable because they don't count hydro as renewable for whatever reason.  The complete lack of logical consistency with regards to its proponents seem like its more religious than anything else.  They have this idea of minimizing impact but then ignore how massive the plants would need to be, and how dangerous mining things like the rare earth metals required to make them is.  Wind, for example, requires 542 tonnes of iron and steel per megawatt hour.  The only thing proven from ""investing"" in unreliables is that the cost of electricity skyrockets because they require a redundancy source so that your heat doesn't turn off if you had a particularly cloudy month.",1572566703

I went to a big empty area and just started laying down tiny and small rooms made of bark. Remember they don't need to be bedrooms so don't even worry about furniture.

Then pretty much just grabbed the roster and some residents signs and made little adjustments to walltype etc (a few needed a gold brazier or 2) to account for ambience and fanciness.

Its basically the same internals as my Rage model (Brushed Motors, ability to have select fire/motor speed control, short stroke solenoid), but in bullpup form! The barrel is piping that should be avail at your local home depot. I just fried my chrono, but i would expect this to be hitting in the 130s-140s on fang revamps and 3s due to a little bit of barrel drag (rage is 150-160 with the same setup). I do notice slightly improved accuracy though. Im sure ill throw my brushless setup in one eventually too! Follow along as iI make final tweaks to this on my instagram!

How does the missing area express itself? If you move the pen to the edge of the marked area on the tablet, does it register (does the cursor move at all when near the edge of the area)? Or does it stop short of the active area?

I assume the cursor just stops before the edge of the screen, so try shrinking the active area in the driver while keeping about an equal ""deadzone"" between all edges of the active area.

Have you tried the official huion drivers? Seeing how they react couls be interesting. Also mess around with the active area in those drivers.

Just in case, on the top screen area part of the driver gui, select display1 from the drip down menu.

Remember to press save changes after doing anything in the gui",1572566704

Here, you will mostly find a quartet of web series created in an animation program called Anime Studio.

DSBT InsaniT- A lighthearted primarily comedy series starring a colorful cast of characters in a bizarre (and rather silly) world derived from a wide array of stories and dreams I created during my childhood.

Animated Duels- A side series of tag duels in the YuGiOh card game.

Dreamscape- A more serious action/adventure series with an overarching plot in a dangerous and fantastic world derived from thousands of dreams.

Vexus Videos- Similar to Dreamscape in that it is a more serious action/adventure series with a story to tell, but more like DSBT in that it has most of the same cast and a focus on the relationships between the characters.

There are also a few other things like my Graffiti Kingdom Creature Showcase, Wander Over Yonder Reviews and Riffs, and some Digimon game footage.

https://www.howmuchisit.org/how-much-does-day-care-cost/

The average monthly cost for daycare is $611, but lets double that and say an even $1200.

1200*12=$14,400 per year.

https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-are-annual-earnings-full-time-minimum-wage-worker

yearly salary for federal minimum wage is $15,080.

In other words, if you **double** the average monthly cost of daycare and assume the absolute minimum possible, they still come out ahead.

"Ask_Politics","t5_2t160","&gt;I've been talking about the DNC hack, which is the focus of the 2016 Ukraine crowdstrike theory that Giuliani was investigating.  Hilary's email server wasn't part of the conspiracy that Trump was pressuring the Ukrainians to announce an investigation into. The DNC hack was the primary cyberattack which succeeded in influencing the election. 

It's my understanding those were phishing attacks on Gmail accounts (not completely sure). So not exactly ""hacks"" in the strictest sense. 

But Google will ship a hard drive with stored Gmail to commercial users that pay. 

&gt;&gt; And again, speaking as an engineer who has built cloud systems, a cloud system is made up of physical hardware. You can absolutely pull hard drives for forensics. I've personally done this with Amazon EC2. 
&gt;
&gt;I'm sceptical of your claim here.  Yes, AWS storage is of course distributed across physical hardware.  But they use storage virtualization technology to spread the stored files across an array of  disks.

In practice, no. This is because of speed. Moving data across fiber channel, or whatever is slower than internal PCI express which is why hyperconverged systems are a thing. SAS gets around this but it's pricey. In most of the cloud systems I've worked on, a single instance would be confined to a single hard disk. 

&gt;Gathering ""the physical disk"" would require pulling an array of disks which also contain other customers' data, in a data center where customers are not allowed to go.  

In practice I believe what Amazon actually does is copy the instance to a new hard disk and ship it to the customer. 

&gt;There is no mention in any of AWS's incident response documentation of a way to request physical hardware isolation. 

Microsoft Azure offers this (though possibly only to the Feds), Amazon does not as far as I know. 

&gt;However,  making a disk image of the virtual disk of an EC2 instance is trivial with a couple clicks.   That's the obvious way to conduct forensics,  while your suggested method sounds extremely implausible. 

See above, I'm not disagreeing.

So where are the disk images?

&gt;Given you've offered no evidence of your previous claims and have waited this long to mention your experience,  I suspect dishonesty.  I'm going to withdraw from this conversation unless you provide some evidence that what you claim is plausible.

I've worked mental health for years and I have seen the worst things happen to a lot of people. I've seen it destroy people for decades and, in some instances, kill them. To say their torture and agony was unavoidable would be insulting. 

So, I view everything around us can be used for a purpose one way or another. You can use your experience as you see fit. I was in an absolute tailspin for roughly 3 years before I was able to find something to pull myself out of it. Now I just look for ways to use the worst times of my life to make sure they never happen again. 

Those terrible things didn't happen for a ""reason"", but they happened. I make the difference because I don't think it's in God's plan for cases like a sexual assault victim killing themselves. I don't see that happening ""for a reason"". They happen because mankind is not perfect and things occur without reason.

One day, I'd say a month after we initially met, he sends his 2000th invite and I just think ""fuck it, let's see what he has"" I get in and he has a couple other unfortunate people with him. One of these people, who's name will be kept private, started to gravitate towards me a bit. We were on the same team, the kid was on the opposite, and we just owned him.

For example, did you know that whales have a pelvis and femur (hip bones)? They don't have hips. They don't have legs. They certainly can't walk. And the femurs aren't actually functionally attached to anything. But the bone structures are still there, because they haven't been such a problem as to cause survival issues. They probably have gotten smaller and even less functional over many generations, but they have never disappeared.

So there must have been something applying evolutionary pressure that made primate hair literally unhelpful and dangerous to survival. The question is what?",1572566707

The main goal of that build is to prevent people laning your team, you drop an empowering rift then 1 tap, and if you dont have the rift the arcsoul needs to hit the enemy 2-3 times to clean up. The bow itself may not have an icarus grip, but the dots damage allows your team to push from a side while they are trying to heal. The letter monarch player has the upper hand in most duels, as they literally can keep players out of combat burning.

I find it ironic that you would post this as I am having the same thoughts. I want an AnyCubic Photon but I am also considering other resin based options. 
A friend has an Ender, which does produce some nice quality prints. I have two Anets, which have been modified for safety. I think the only way I could improve them more would be to put them in an enclosure and utilize an aluminum frame. 

I am considering the Flash Forge Resin Printer or a FabPro 1000. These are pretty pricey, but I’d like something that I can print multiples up and have a lot of terrain printed at once since they have a large build plate.",1572566708

I spoke to a guy on YouTube a couple months ago who said he was able to get it by purchasing a hardcopy of destiny the collection. I've also heard that the codes in those boxes no longer works which leads me to believe he was just bs'ing. 

I posted only because I wanted to see if there was something a fellow redditor may have discovered to get passed the block behind a preorder that maybe I hadn't thought of. I don't think there is but it was worth a shot.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","My number one thing is finding that balance between flavor and optimization. Different players and GMs have different tastes. I run groups right down the middle.

The way I do this is I recommend my players meet certain benchmarks for their character progression. For example, at level 1, they should contribute a +5 to attack and have a 16 AC. This is assuming usual combat buffs. A bard that has an attack bonus of +1 but gives 3 other party members +1 with inspire competence contributes +5 to attack. This reminds the newbie sorcerer player that they should get their mage armor on once they descend into the dungeon, to bring their AC from 12 to 16.

This allows them to still be useful at every level, while giving them lots of room to pick interesting archetypes that fit the flavor they want but may not be optimized ""combos"". As long as they meet the benchmarks, they'll have an effective character. It works really well so far.",1572566709

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","I've thought about how many times demons were talked about in the bible. 

And I've thought about how a lot of different writers wrote different books. 

I've also thought that when the books were written, were they written in the same areas because I think christianity is a blanket term (if thats the right word idk) because i think the term christianity came about when those government leaders put the bible together, getting books from different writers. I mean there wad one guy with the printing press that gathered them to make one whole book and then i think there was a meeting amount catholic leaders and they added stuff. Then somewhere along the line Christians separated from Catholics and took out some books. 

So honestly, i think its VERY possible that these books were all different religions or something. 

Ive heard that some early christians still believed in multiple gods because their former religion had done that or something idk that was from a charismatic preacher, idk how true it is. 

But if it wasn't different religions, the religion was definitely different when different areas had different books before it all came together with the printing press..............

"gachagaming","t5_3l98x","Firstly, pay2win is in every idle game. theres no point argueing about this. You want to do well in afk arena or harbingers ? drop a credit card. Goddess legion is no different. This is like complaining gacha has rng elements - its something you have to accept going into the genre.

Anyways, I am sure you're looking for actual reviews of it rather than being told another idle is p2w:

1. the game involves a team of 5 units and your hero. you can upgrade your hero but its a very linear fashion (skills increase stats, so its not like it grants you new effects) though there is some form of ""building"" as you can build around the ""faction"" of your team. Otherwise, your MC is very meh. Even your gear is linear in progression (you will keep swapping gear for higher level gear) and refining and revamping your gear is pointless since you outlevel it anyways.

2. the units (goddesses) can be found via gacha OR shards. If you're lucky, you pull em, if you're unlucky, you get shards, if you're very unlucky, you get EXP. However, you get ALOT of pull chances. Minimum 2 a day (guaranteed after dailies). Then you have more based on which dailies you do. You can save them for 10 pulls every few days and 20 pulls guarantee an SSR. it goes R&gt;SR&gt;SSR&gt;SSSR&gt;UR. UR are new so not much info I have on them. SSSR can sometimes be pulled (very rare) but typically you sacrifice your SSR units for these points which you can use to redeem other units (including SSSR). This makes it, even amongst gacha games, incredibly generous if you're aiming for specific waifus. The ""progression"" here, is that you will need multiple pulls to power them up. goddesses also have a form of ""gear"" though its just items to specifically increase certain stats. So there is some unit building but its very mild. Formations and unit composition do matter.

3. All combat is auto. Even skill activations. there is some QOL elements as the units will progress map to map without your input but will stop once they die to redo the same stage. You have input in the other modes (and they have a shitton of side modes - to get gear, pvp, 2nd pvp, they even have a **tower defence** mode, 2nd mini dungeons, world boss  and tower mode). but alot of them are shallow. not bad but very shallow. I believe this is because the game is focused on the '10min train ride' that alot of asian games do.

4. graphics are meh, art is great but you won't see the art often (only within the goddess's screens). the goddess are also based on mythology. sound is meh.

5. **game doesnt ask the user to check in regularly for the idle exp** biggest plus. many other gacha games make the user check in every 8 hours or once a day. you can leave goddess legion running for days on end. As an idle game? You don't need much interaction which is probably the biggest plus.

So all in all? A very middle of the road idle game. Polish is lacking but in general, I'd still rate it above harbingers (which never update), aurora legend (extremely low pull rates, pull chances and party composition) and idle angels (lack of units, lack of content)

Afk arena is more polished but goddess legion is a nice side gig.

**edit** thanks for the g-  NO! jesus christ, this was not worth golding. my friend, I appreciate it but money from your wallet better spent on waifus or coffee.",1572566712

"GamePhysics","t5_2viau","I think on hard it's a decent balance. The narrative is supposed to be a bigger focus. I've heard on the hardest difficulty it's really hard to keep your followers alive, so if you want additional challenge maybe give that a shot. I get what you mean about the maps being small, but what they lack in physical size, they make up for in depth. One of the biggest flaws with NV in my eyes was the ridiculous amounts of walking (I had power armor and regular clothes bound to hotkeys to speed up walking speed).
&gt; the junk is basically useless 

Indeed. That's why it's called junk. Not trying to be smart here, I get where you're coming from. It's because in 4 (and probably 76 I refuse to play it) junk is in fact not junk but incredibly valuable as you need it for weapon/armor mods. I really hated lugging around hundreds of aluminum cans to make scopes and whatnot. Eventually I just min-maxed by buying shipments and found that to be tedious and boring. TOW decouples the systems again and that's pretty much the way it should be.

I'm not sure how far you've played, but there's a lot of weapon and armor customization. The difference is that the mods affect statistics and don't always change the physical appearance. For me that's a minor gripe, but for you that could be a bigger issue so I understand.

I encourage you not to give up so easily on TOW. Its main innovations are interactive narratives and characters. It's been a while since I've seen a game go this far with branching dialogue and whatnot. The RPG mechanics and QoL changes over modern Fallouts are also huge. Those are the reasons why people are going nuts.",1572566713

Can I Onewheel in the cold?

Riding in colder temperatures can affect the performance of the board. One key thing is to make sure the board is always being stored inside. Keeping your board in the cold can cause damage to your tire, motor, and battery.

Can I ride in any terrain?

Onewheels are built like tanks. Onewheel uses a direct-drive hub motor that has no moving parts, so you can ride over any terrain without fear of damaging your board. All Onewheels are water resistant, so they can withstand some moisture. We recommend taking extra caution when riding in or near water and letting your board dry completely before charging to avoid damage.

I have a cover on the charging port and the power button seems to be sealed straight from the get go (It’s obviously different from the XR situation).  I’m not riding waves to work - I avoid the big stuff.",1572566713

I loved using the MK2 in the beta. At the end I wasn't using any other gun, I had 4 different loadouts of the MK2. It's been a month since the beta and when I got back behind the MK2 it just didn't have the same feel. I can't quantify what is different because it's been so long. But now I don't find the MK2 exciting or even usable. I tried out the Kar98 hoping that maybe it would fill that void left by the new MK2, but it didn't. The Kar starts with 15 rounds of ammo, which wouldn't be bad if it was one shot kills. The Kar cycles too slow, has low ammo and is weak. Devs, either give it more ammo or more damage, preferably more damage. I started using the AX-50 to see if I could make a rush class out of it to get close to what the MK2 was like. I started destroying with it, only slightly less mobile than the Kar and MK2 but SO much more powerful. Why even have guns like the Kar and MK2 that should be one shot kill rush guns when they can't do one shot's more than 50% of the time? They fill this middle ground that makes them almost useless. They're too weak for rushing and too weak for sniping. They're more mobile than snipers but that doesn't matter when they can't one shot close range reliably. They have more range than a shotgun but can't one shot at any range reliably. Shotguns one shot no problem, snipers one shot no problem but the Kar and MK2 almost always take 2 shots if not more at any range. Why have them in the game with their current stats?",1572566714

Lower floor walls are made out of concrete poles (not centered), place them side ways from corner to corner 4 blocks high (Because of the poles you can shoot and hit zombies easily and they cant go through, you also can get them to steel). For corners im using sideways ramp. No need for a door, put spikes all around. Middle of the floor put a support out of blocks that goes to the roof and place ladder on it to go to the 2nd floor and down to basement in which you dig a tunnel like 12 blocks outside and place a vault hatch. Cover this tunnel in concrete to be more secured. And this is how you go in and out of your base.

This is my late game base but you can build something like this but smaller and with cobblestone (flagstone blocks) and upgrade them with cobble and live in some building",1572566715

&amp;#x200B;

And we can also see that their tactics will deliver a new stronger hard-Brexit Conservative majority which will pull us out of the EU like it or lump it on or before the 31st of January, so a massive own goal there, I can see why Brexiteers go lightly on the lib-dems now, despite their fierce anti-Brexit stance, they're the best chance they have of delivering a hard, no second referendum Brexit, it's bloody genius.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have my doubts many of their new voters would really agree with Jo's other more right wing policies, where she sits to the right of Boris Johnson economically.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","\&gt; what's a good tip to start exploring song structures  


Start by analyzing the song structures of songs you actually like.   


Note: 2-5-1s are especially common in Jazz - and it's not just the same 2-5-1 (Dm-G7-C) over and over again - it's often a 2-5-1 in the tonic key...then a 2-5 in another key, then a 2-5 which leads back into the 2-5-1 of the home key. Or something along those lines.  


Let's look at the jazz standard ""I Should Care"". The thing is \*entirely\* 2-5s, and 2-5-1s. But they temporarily ""tonicize"" other keys (make other keys sound like home, briefly). Home base moves around \*a lot\*, but it does keep returning to C Major often. I've marked up the chord chart [here](https://i.imgur.com/GAXQKRn.png). Here's what it [sounds like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28jNjpkc57M).    


If you're more interested in pop and rock, I suggest checking out the analysis tabs on Hook Theory's website. You can search up popular songs and see what the chord theory is behind them (though don't treat it as the gospel truth - I've seen a decent number of wrong interpretations): [https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/the-beatles/all-my-loving](https://www.hooktheory.com/theorytab/view/the-beatles/all-my-loving)",1572566717

Would you feel good about marrying a girl who slept with 5 different people in the week that you met?

This is a legit question btw, I wonder what you guys think about ‘sluts’. For me part of why seduction if fun and rewarding is because I have to work for it, if a girl is spreading her legs to any man then what’s the point?

These are all solid things for children to learn as it is, to be conditioned to understand that would be so much better than trying to shield the realities of life out there, ""Sure there are scammers and cheaters out there, but this is an ad on TV!!

He's far, far too tainted now but there's no reason at all why a social democratic labour leader would not walk the election if they stuck to an agenda of simple and effective policy, making changes to the system we have.

Instead we have Corbyn and McDonell who (and it isn't just the right wing media painting the picture) are absolutely desperate to reveal harder left policies after harder left policies.

For the whole time they've been at the forefront of labour politics any time things look like they're going their way the mask slips a bit more and they come out with something from what's clear is their *real* agenda.

Just like the ERG style tories want to rip the welfare state apart and turn us into the USA, the Corbyn cult want to force a democratic socialist government on us and given how much solidarity they've shown to dictators in the past I doubt they'd be too bothered about state press, censorship, propaganda and banning other parties.",1572566718

We have issues that most people do not understand. I have been dealing with dislocations and a truly horrible spine for years. It was not until about 10 years ago that my big, big family found out we had EDS. Most of us had some issues, some worse than others. My family in England were the ones that had a diagnosis. All of us had been so casual about the dislocations and talked about how we were just a clumsy family. People who do not experience these issues do not get that opening a shower curtain can sometimes dislocate a thumb! Our Rheumatologist had only seen one other person with our diagnosis.

I was told I can't save any money by switching, because prices in my area are so high because there is no competition, and prices just keep going even higher. I actually found on the legacy plan, my prices only went up $2 because I have a bundle of 3 services while other people had their bill go up $5-20 per month. I am at the point where my legacy bundle has stopped going up, so I am keeping it until I die basically or until they force me into something else because a spectrum plan is going to cost me way more and I will get less TV channels.

"internetparents","t5_31jj6","Just off a 11 hr flight myself so here goes: Pack an empty, hopefully collapsible water bottle or two and fill them at a water fountain past security. Plane air is dry and long flights can dehydrate you if you don’t drink enough water. 
International flights usually come with free alcohol, but don’t drink too much, that can dehydrate you as well, or leave you with a hangover. 
Check if your seat has power and if so, take a charger for your phone or tablet. If not, get a power pack to keep your devices charged. Check the airline website and see if you need to download any apps to watch movies or access the internet while on the plane. 
Check SeatGuru dot com for commentary on the seats you’re assigned. Sometimes you can get stuck in a seat that doesn’t recline or that has something in the way of your feet. If you find out something negative, see if you can change seats. 
If the seat you booked isn’t a lay-flat business class one, get a neck pillow to support your head when you try to sleep. A comfortable eye mask also helps. 
When you get to your destination, try to stay awake until the local bedtime, and get out in the morning and get some sun. That helps reset your body to the new time zone faster.

Oh, and I second the “dress comfortably “ thing. Wear sweatpants, nothing tight or binding. Bring an extra pair of socks so you can take your shoes off and still keep your feet warm.
If you have a layover, check the airport, they may have a place you can take a shower.",1572566719

Each new Hero starting with Deathwing could still cost gold for the first month or even three months, but every Hero pre-Deathwing could be released for all.

The best part of FTiki its that she can become a beast if she is alone once you get all her skills, also if you have a unit that can heal and increase her def and res she can counter anything that is not on the hardest quest (needs some merges and skills like Aether to fight alone).

Keep in mind that she is a dragon and there is a LOT of dragon killers, the worst are the tomes ones. She also can kill dragons.

A dancer like LAzura/the free Ninian or a unit with reposition/draw back/smite can make her move better or move her out of danger, remember that her skill only gets the effect if in the start of your turn she is alone (no unit in her cross movement), the extra stat buff and mov are your best friends.

Another good unit that gives her a buff its LEliwood but he is a legendary unit and you need to wait for his return, at that point maybe you have other units.

If just the shape, you can just throw it into Unity or Unreal. Then import the SDK of your headset. Drag and drop the component for the VR camera. Drog and drop your model. Click Play. It will probably take you longer to download the game engine than to actually complete this task. (Well setting up how to fly would take some time. But you could have one person at the computer just dragging you around manually from inside the engine)

If it's anything more than just the shape, it would depend on how well things are outputted by your other programs and if they're compatible with the engine of choice.   


Alternatively, you could try uploading it to SketchFab? They have a VR viewer. I haven't actually used it though. I think the mobile VR (like Google Cardboard) should work fine, but you may have to jump through some hoops for the PC browser version?",1572566720

don’t believe me? listen to paper mache, flying microtonal banana, fishing for fishies, infest the rats nest.

I need: food, shelter, heat/air, electricity, water, internet, a line of communication (landline or cellphone).

If you have enough shoes and clothes to make it through a couple work weeks, do you need $500 worth of more clothes? If you need that many articles of new clothing, it better be due to everything else having rips, holes, permanent stains, and/or no longer fitting due to weight gain/loss.

You acknowledge that you grew up under less privileged circumstances. Are you buying the excess items that you do because you're afraid the source of money will be gone, so you gotta buy now? Are you hoarding items, trying to fill the void from not having enough in childhood? Or maybe you had enough, but not enough to talk about the latest cool toy on the playground?  You don't need to keep up with others/impress people. If you're doing your best at work, you don't have to worry about the money well drying up.

I worked at Walmart in my early 20s as a cashier at first, then a cart pusher, and finally pet department. To me, Walmart was a miserable place to work, especially in a cashier position. I just said the bare minimum to people to keep my job. Except when I went to pets, because I was passionate about getting people to understand a goldfish or Oscar couldn't live in just a small bowl of tap water. 

Anyway, I'm in my 40s now.  9 years ago I somehow managed to get a job that pays a very nice wage, beating out dozens of others for it. Probably because I spun my stutter to the panel interview as something that I persevered through, like Thomas Jefferson, Moses, etc. Except that was a line of bull because at that point I hadn't overcome my insecurities about my speech.

I will say the older I get the less I care what other people think about how I talk (amongst other things). Not caring seems to make me stutter less.

In a rocket, the thrust rotates with the rocket, so it keeps the same relation with the CoG until the control system changes it.  There's no runaway instability, so it's a simpler problem.

Incidentally, this is why putting the nozzle on the top to ""suspend"" the rocket doesn't make it any more stable.  If the rocket tilts, so does the line of thrust.  (Even Goddard got this one wrong.)",1572566724

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Dude, thanks so much for all the fantastic examples and explanations.  
  
That chromatic stuff is really awesome. I feel that it's used quite a bit in Brazilian music. There's that famous song from City of God, ""Preciso me Encontrar"" by Cartola. Have you heard it? The guitar player basically moves between every chord chromatically. It's really good. But maybe it's not tritone substitutions. I'm going to study the form of the song to see.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUjOfsoBhMY  
  
On that note, when I'm analyzing a song and I'm like ""aw there are NO 2-5-1s WHAT GIVES!!!"" then maybe there really are 2-5-1s, they're just hidden because of the tritone substitutions.  
  
Are tritone substitutions bidirectional? Like the G gives the Db, but does the Db give a G? Or does it do a circular thing where everything is being chased by something else? Wait I can figure this out... C gives F#. Then the 4th of F# is B, then B# is C. So it is bidirectional!
  
Extensions and voicings are something I am beginning to explore.  
  
So sick.",1572566724

"SportingKC","t5_2secp","Consistency and not finishing chances. Everything really boils down to those two things. The season started very strong, but turned into a perfect storm in terms of things that went wrong.

* Center Backs - SKC is historically a very defensive minded team. This past off-season saw the departure of Ike Opara, who was and is awesome and just came off an mls defender of the year award. Him leaving forced PV to come up with a replacement.

* CCL - Needless to say just being in CCL really changes how you go about your season from training schedule to squad rotation. We made it pretty far in CCL, which meant even more games early on in the season.

* Injuries - You've probably heard it more than a few times, but we had a crazy amount of injuries to key players this year. One example was Roger Espinoza being out for several months towards the early part of the season.

Those are just some things that come to mind. All of this and more contributed to a lack of consistency, but even inconsistent teams can still do well if they take advantage of the chances they get. This season we had an obvious (so much so that PV called it out in post-season interviews) lack of finishing chances.

Just my take on it.",1572566724

He's an adult. One who pays his rent. He doesn't need your permission. You also have no right to take his car keys or phone that he also pays for. He would be well within his rights to press charges against you for theft of property. 

You need to reel it in cause you're acting like a loon. Your minor kids are your responsibility, no one elses.

I know it's hard when your kids grow up and start supporting themselves. Not being their dark overlord anymore is a tough pill to swallow for some. But you need to come to terms with the fact that you have no authority over him anymore. 

If babysitting is part of the contract then his rent needs to be adjusted accordingly. I think starting pay for a nanny is $20 an hour, though it might be more. Or you could pay your 15 year old a few bucks a day and stop being fucking weird. 15 is well old enough to look after themselves and a 9 year old.",1572566724

If I win out, I still need a very specific scenario to sneak into the 5 or 6 seed. We've had draft pick trades enabled for 8 years now, but nobody has ever done one before. I've always wanted to get some excitement in the league because this is one of those leagues where there will only be 1 or 2 trades per year and they *never* include actual studs. Today I managed to trad Edelman, Evans, Mack, and my 2020 8th rounder for the 4th place team's 2020 1st rounder and some bench players. Now his team is completely stacked and I'm playing the Top 3 teams against each other as they scramble to make upgrades to keep up. It's a superflex 3WR league and I still have Brees, Jameis, Kyler, Hunter Henry, Davante, Tyrell, and Emmanuel.

Most people start living a different lifestyle somewhere between the ages of 25-30 (or so).

Once upon a time, I was a teenager who got high on DXM and weed and any other drugs I could find, etc. Today, I really wish I had been smarter and just chosen a different way **from the beginning.**

I wish I had a house now, but I don’t. I wish I owned a car now, but I don’t. I wish I had a lot more money in my savings account, but I don’t. I wish I didn’t have a criminal record. I wish I didn’t have all these shitty memories of jail &amp; rehab. I’m a bright guy, but I fell very far behind because of the path I put myself on as a teenager. 

You only get one life. My advice to you is: **Consider your life.** A day spent getting high might be a very fun day, but a life spent getting high is a fucking waste of life. Try to build a good life for yourself. Learn shit. Save some money.",1572566725

I still think Taylor wouldn't just say. I think she just handled it diplomatically. She understands them .... but praises Jack. It doesn't have to be about Max.

May sound silly but everything can inspire you and give you hints. 

Events of that anime taught me that just because something is impossible today, might not be like this for long. 

Piece by piece, paths will unlock.

Deceive yourself.

Deceive the world.

The world can be tricked.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","As a southerner spending my second winter in the north, I disagree.

I do think that having 4 distinct seasons is lovely. And the quiet snow that seems to bring on stillness is amazing. But after 3, 4 snowfalls I am over it. Aside from the weather, I can’t think of much that is nice up here. Somehow, even the mosquitos are worse than at home, and I grew up on the coast between the ocean &amp; brackish marshes.

In the south we have better food, manners and hospitality. I am not trying to be rude when I say this, just something I have noticed. I used to be shocked at how cold &amp; distant northerners are, and sometimes still am, until someone reminded me it is merely regional - they aren’t rude, just not as friendly and hospitable as us at home. I mean people in the grocery store give me dirty looks for asking how they’re doing while passing them.

I suppose this is an unpopular opinion and suits this subreddit well.",1572566727

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","Ironically, this happened around Halloween last year. In the wake of my marriage imploding I got on the apps (before I was ready, really). Matched with a woman, not exactly realizing at the time but very quickly being made aware that she was in an open marriage and pretty much only looking for casual fun. 

To my dead bedroom'd ass this sounded great and we made arrangements to meet at a Cirque du Soleil-style event that was touring past us, have food and see if we clicked. In the week or so until the day we met we continued to text, chat and flirt. Got pretty adult, not gonna lie.

Meet for food, seemed to go fine, we travel to the show in separate cars. We're sitting there watching, suddenly she turns to me and says ""I'm going to the bathroom, I'm not leaving, I'll be right back."" Three minutes later I get a text. She got her period and had to leave. By the time I replied that I'd like to say goodnight in person, she was gone. 

Honestly to this day I don't know if that was the truth or not. She texted me for a few more days before ultimately pulling the total disappearance. I've deconstructed the night in my head a few times since then and tried to determine if I did or said something that killed her interest, or if I just didn't live up to expectations. I do wish she had been comfortable enough to tell me if she just wasn't into it, but I can't fault a woman for not trusting how I would respond to that, so I try not to hold anger over it.

Sometimes it feels like a funny story though! I have had a few laughs over it, just because it was so absurd at the time.",1572566730

"modernwarfare","t5_2r8qf","So true. I gave up FIFA for basically this season a few years ago. It seemed once I made a new team or bought a new player; my team was UNSTOPPABLE for 5-10 games. But after that, if I didn't buy a new player or trade my team in; it was basically garbage. Even though my play style didn't change. Completely unexplainable until I found out about Scripting.

All in the same Division too, so it's not like it was a skill thing. You purely did well based on how much/how often you spent money on the game.

Regarding CoD; it might just be. But on top of all the things you and OP have said - I've also noticed something else.

When someone is shooting at you from an angle and you snap on to them, you will have noticeably more aim-assist to give you a fair chance for the gunfight. I first noticed this on BO3 when shooting someone out of a spawn resulted in more sporadic and unpredictable recoil as apposed to shooting them mid-map.

In this COD; I'm CONVINCED that your bullets do more damage/less recoil etc if you are the underdog in the gunfight. Not by double or triple; but enough to maybe give you an extra few kills and a few less deaths per game. All about getting you to that optimal 1KD mark and thinking you're better (or worse) then you really are.

Another thing; especially in 10v10, I'm convinced that spawns are manipulated depending on the momentum of the game/how skilled your team is vs the other etc. Play that Euphrates Bridge map (or whatever it's called) and *tell me* you don't notice yourself spawning closer and further from the bridge at random moments which likely coincide with momentum and how the game wants you to perform.

Game wants you to do poorly? It will spawn you further away and the enemies closer to their side of the bridge so they have the advantage. HQ is even worse as I alluded to above.

It's actually rigged.",1572566730

"Exercise","t5_2qjf3","I normally don't feel a stretch or contraction when doing bench unless I go for crazy amount of volume. Sometimes even then, I don't feel anything. I feel it alot more when doing flat dumbbell bench though.

Depending on your grip width and technique, it may also change the feeling. Your body type/composition (overweight vs skinny or barrel chest vs flat chest) as well as arm lengths, shoulder width, ect may also have an effect. Been a while since I looked at it but from what I remember, the barbell bench press is unable to grt your pecs fully stretched due to the bar hitting your chest. That's why dumbbells may help you ""feel"" it as they have greater range of motion

Weather you feel your chest or not, as long as your numbers are going up. That should carry more value than weather or not you feel a certain sensation.",1572566730

"Atypical","t5_31rfn","I'm curious which shows on Netflix you feel are forced? I mean one of Netflix's first big hits was Orange is the New Black which is one of the gayest shows out there. Haha. I've watched many of Netflix's shows and a lot of them have only had straight characters. A few gay but none that I felt had unrealistic forced representation.

I'd agree with you that the actual writing of Casey/Izzie getting together seemed to mainly be for the twist. They made it out like Izzie's bf was the possible love interest for Casey but instead it was Izzie. However, even though the lead up was pretty shit I do find them actually quite believable and Casey being bi or gay would make sense to me. The only times she expressed interest in having sex with her boyfriend was pretty much in reaction to something outside of their relationship. Also I don't think Izzie is a terrible person.

**Evergreen Lake House:**

Pros - 

* Very beautiful in pictures
* Unique
* Mountainy/Colorado Feel, which is what we always said we wanted and could be more exciting for all the out of town guests 
* Bring your own alcohol (so maybe we could save some money here?)
* Lots of windows on the indoor space
* My dad wants to make an arch and we could do that here
* Less expensive venue cost (but food may cost more so it might balance out) ($4000) only inc. tables/chairs
* Indoor gas fireplace, nice for the mood (but too hot for summer? they said they might not turn it on b/c it will combat the A/C)

Cons - 

* Not many hotels nearby and harder for guests to get an Uber/Lyft in the area  and minimal reserved parking, so probably have to get some shuttles.
* Not a lot to walk to if people do stay in the few places around Evergreen
* Very quick turn around time - there is a morning wedding that has to be out by 4 PM, then we can start setting up for ours at 5 PM and ceremony starts at 6 (I'd have to hire a coordinator to help)
* No getting ready spaces - we would probably get an Airbnb and have to travel over right before the wedding
* Not as 'wedding' feeling - the guy who manages it just does booking for the parks service I think and is very nice but less 'let me take care of you and all your worries!' that the Barn @ RC had
* Smaller/more cramped ceremony space - if we end up with over something like 100 people, some will have to stand - but we are worried too few people would make the big indoor space feel empty.
* It is part of a public space so people may be walking around when we are taking pictures and doing activities on the lake (no motor boats) - this isn't Too big a deal to me
* Worried people will spend more time hanging out on the deck (cuz it's beautiful) then be inside dancing, which is my fear (a lame dance floor)
* A bit of road noise can be heard from the ceremony spot/deck

**The Barn @ Raccoon Creek**

Pros - 

* Amazing get ready space that we can use from 10 AM until the end of the night, also making set-up less stressful/fast
* Great price on the in-house food and alcohol, plus they have good reviews for food 
* Option of having the dinner outside (which is something I always thought of doing but not required), However, the parking lot is right next to this space so that is not as nice/pretty
* Probably wouldn't get a coordinator because they are very helpful and will be there the night of
* They really made me feel like the special taken-care-of bride even just during the tour! We are planning from out of state so this made it feel like the less stressful choice.
* Everyone teared up when they showed us the doors that open up where I walk down the aisle, it's a very pretty set-up
* It is also a really pretty outdoor space

Cons - 

* More expensive venue cost ($9000) but comes with linnens/tableware etc.
* Can't use dad's arch - they have a permanent one
* Littleton seems less interesting for guests from out of town - not many places to walk to so they might need cars but probably easier to get uber/lyft than Evergreen
* Not the Colorado/Mountainy feel we were hoping for
* We feel a barn is less 'us' - we are very not farm/country people but luckily this space isn't too rustic feeling
* The barn itself does not have very many windows and is thus a bit dark (which is a shame...it could have amazing views out one side but it is just a solid wall)

Sorry that was long. We just can't decide if the mountainy look/feel is more important or having somewhere where we already feel taken care of. 

Thanks!",1572566733
"Gamingcirclejerk","t5_2sf2b","Hey so, don't get me wrong, when I make this sort of comment, I'm well aware that the vast majority of the internet still relentlessly ridicules and shits on Fallout 76, I know it's hardly had a total turn around in terms of reception or anything.

That said, I find it kinda interesting how I occasionally see a few people talking about how much they respect Bethesda for continuing to work on and put effort into continuing development into 76. 

But then I've never seen anything on the sort for Anthem, not one bit. Only ridicule. I've seen people commend Fallout 76 devs for not giving in, and still updating it, but then in the same breath call for Anthem to just be left dead in the water.

I just find that sorta weird. This isn't me defending the state of Anthem, or trying to insult 76, I can't say I've played either of them. Like the games, dislike the games, have no opinion either way, all is fine. 

I do respect both dev teams for continuing to work on, update and try and improve both games though, despite their struggles and the initial reception, and I find it disheartening to think that one of them is slowly recuperating and at the very least getting a level of respect for not giving up from some, while the other seems to get nothing *but* mockery, even from the people who respect 76 for still getting work.",1572566733

In a direct clash with a single nation, the CoS would always come out on top, which is why there's so much pussyfooting before the war actually begins. Just because the two are similar does not mean they are the same, and the difference between the hard power and soft influence of both organizations is quite clear even at a glance.

The only reason that support for the church is lacking after the war is because the organization itself outside of CF is scattered and disorganized. It's not a coincidence the ones most opposed to the Empire also happen to be the most pious.

Even if we don't know exactly what the church was up to in those other time periods, we have an idea based on the person in charge... but even without that, the idea the Church doesn't claim any responsibility that is openly documented is concerning. That's a branch that operates under the Church's name, that means their actions are an extension of the church. It's not a good look.",1572566733

I worry that Armor of Agathys would be very poor at higher levels - the bonus HP is 5-15, and the damage done is 5-15 a variable number of times. If I could choose it as one of my level 1 spells I'd take it no question. As is, I might consider grabbing the Ritual Caster feat, in which case I'd be able to integrate more utility stuff like this.

Spiritual weapon is definitely on my radar - free attacks that last while I'm in rage. But I worry that I'll need my bonus actions for entering and leaving rage, for example, and that the damage from the weapon will level poorly.

Right now my top 3 choices are Thunderstep, Mirror Images and Find Steed - before Find Steed wasn't on my radar, so thanks!",1572566735

I bet he would beat at least one Squad Captain from Clover Kingdom. Besides, this General was from old generation and was meant to be replaced anyway by new ones (Mars, Langris, etc).

"TheWalkingDeadGame","t5_2tzww","&gt;You can’t say its fair game to base how badass they are on their unflattering moments because it’s like basing how good a character’s writing is. It’s nothing like that. That doesn’t support why it’s fair to use them. To me, it’s more bullshit people can use to say “nO! hE wAsN’t bAdASs!”

So determining the limits of one's badassery isn't fair to use? Okay. 

&gt;So, you determine how badass they are by scaling their badass moments against least badass moments, taking the “sum” of that and then pitting them against the others, or do you do this some other way?

That's more or less the gist of it. Though the ""sum"" part is quite obviously subjective. For example, you think Minerva's bridge scene makes up for all her non-badass moments. I don't think so, at least not compared to the remaining characters (well, except Chuck). 

&gt;She actually was the last raider to nearly kill her, and was the only one that ever came the closest.

Lilly was damn close to do it back in episode 3. 

&gt;Had it not been for the infinite helping hands Clementine received throughout both of their 1v1 fights, she would’ve died in no time.

You can say the same about Lilly for the first 1v1. Even then, being helped by either Louis or Violet isn't anywhere near infinite, whereas AJ saved her multiple times against Lilly.

And *who* exactly helped Clem in her second 1v1 against Minerva? 

&gt;I haven’t mistaken anything for anything. I’m not saying being evil doesn’t make you a badass. I’m saying doing vile things can make you non-badass though, and her actions were beyond non-badass

I can understand at least as far as the first three entries I've listed in my other thread, but in the case no.2 and no.1, Clem was about as intimidating and uncompromising as it gets.

&gt;I don’t see how that’s similar. Clem wasn’t dragged miles away from the people she was with, all by herself, and still chose to defy Carver. 

Minerva still had her sister. Until she killed her. And Clem was by herself in Carver's office, yet she can still choose to defy him.",1572566736

"CultureWarRoundup","t5_3k96u","Nearly all of these could be scaled down to being neat little puzzle games or scaled up to being full blown maximum-autism reality simulators. The road stuff could definitely all go in a sim game; the signal-timing one could be scaled down to a puzzle game, parking lot optimization could be made into a puzzle game (keep in mind it's a NP-complete problem!), water flow puzzles can exist, etc.

With that in mind, you can turn virtually _any_ kind of problem into a puzzle game. The reason bridge-building and its variants are so popular is that bridges are something that people naturally understand, even if they aren't actually engineers. Most of the programming puzzles aren't actually obviously programming up-front, only a programmer would recognize them as such. Everyone else is like ""oh you make gears turn, okay"" and the programmers are going ""waaaaaitaminute, isn't this Turing-complete?""

So to make a game like this, you need to find a thing that's reasonably familiar to people. Traffic light timings, yes, people get it. Electrical distribution systems might be a bit too abstract (but see [Net](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/net.html) and [Netslide](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/netslide.html)!) for non-electricians, and things like detailed road features are obviously stuff that's too much for a scaled-down puzzle game and has to be restricted to the domain of a simulator.

So, what else works? Well, look at the history of Sim-foo games and Tycoon games. SimCity is the most well known, but SimTower, SimGolf, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, SimCopter, SimFarm (see also Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons and Animal Crossing) - all are things that people are reasonably familiar with from their personal life, even if they don't understand the inner workings. (Who but specialists know how to properly manage a golf course or hospital? But you know how they work _as a user_ and the details can be fudged to make it work for beginners!) And of course who can forget the endless ""run a country"" games, ranging in scale from Civilization to Hearts of Iron.

So what's missing? Let's look at the categories again - hospital, farm, theme park, golf course, skyscraper, city, country. How about a school simulator?",1572566736

You’ve Lost Control of Your Own Thoughts

Have you ever given yourself a panic attack? I have.  All it took was thoughts.  It wasn’t something that was happening to me, it wasn’t something someone said or did.  It was just my thoughts.  And we’re talking cold sweat, adrenaline making my heart beat like crazy, claustrophobia, feeling like I was going insane...a full-blown panic attack.  

Have you ever lost your **it before or while you were giving a presentation and forgot everything you were going to say?  I have.  In front of the President of the International Olympic Committee in Germany, as I was translating a speech.  Why?  Because of a thought. 

Have you ever not done something you really, really wanted to do because you were sure you couldn’t do it?

Has someone told you you’re pretty and you immediately think, “They’re just saying it to be nice”?

So Who is Thinking Your Thoughts?

Right now you’re not the boss in your mind.  You actually have several bosses in there:  

Nervous Nelly lives in the future, in the world of what if.  It’s addicted to irrational fears: things that could happen, but it has no evidence for or things that happened in the past that according to Nelly could happen again.

The Sleep Depriver, the inner planner, the rehasher and the ruminator are all on the same team and they’re often accompanied by the inner critic and the worrier, so it gets pretty crowded in there.  The Sleep Depriver starts working when it gets quiet, when you neglected to finish things you had to do during the day, when the seed of self-doubt, low self-esteem, insecurity and anxiety get their foot in the door at night.  

The Self-Critic is your abusive partner that keeps reminding you other people’s words (your parents, caretakers, peers), other people’s expectations, comparing you to others, reminding you of times you were rejected.  Its goal is to create self-doubt and self-blame.  You put up with this abusive partner due to low self-esteem and lack of self-love.  Unfortunately, this abuser is YOU.  Why would you be so unkind to yourself?  Why would you treat yourself so badly?

The Impulsive One is in charge of making your thoughts angry, frustrated and painful.  The Reactor produces thoughts out of wounds of the past and he has no impulse control.  
Enough is Enough!  
It’s Time to Take Back Control of Your Thoughts!
You’re going to begin by paying attention to your thoughts and catching the negative ones when they sneak in.  This is going to be a process of reprogramming your thoughts and in order for reprogramming to happen, it will take repetition, repetition, repetition, until your new healthy thoughts become a habit.  
You are going to learn to REPROGRAM your thoughts and you’re starting with the Self-critic.  The moment you sense your thoughts disrespecting and criticizing you, immediately interrupt them.  In your mind, shout, “Enough! I AM IN CONTROL NOW!” and replace the thought with reality and facts.  If your thought is “I’m a loser”, you counter it with “Enough! I’m in control now and I will not be disrespected!”
You know your self-critic’s thoughts and how they trigger you.  Stop these bullies because they’re destroying your self-esteem.  When you reprogram your thoughts, the bullies in your mind will get weaker.  
Nervous Nelly is affecting your mental, emotional and physical health because fear triggers the fight or flight response in your brain and everything that goes with it (excess cortisol hormone, clogged arteries, etc.).  You’ll know when Nelly is activated because your heart rate increases, so does your blood pressure, you have a surge of adrenaline that can feel like panic, your breathing becomes shallow so you feel breathless and your muscles and stomach feel tense.
The Impulsive One’s thoughts or feelings activate the fight or flight response just like Nervous Nelly does. The physiological signs of his presence are the same. With a little attention, you should be able to tell the difference between anxiety, anger, frustration, or pain.
The Impulsive One can be controlled with conscious breathing.  It’s simple, but not easy because you’ll be struggling with anxiety, anger, frustration and/or pain.  But once you dominate conscious breathing, you’ll kick the Impulsive One in the ass. Conscious breathing is this easy: 
Pay complete attention to your breath.  Breathe in through your nose.  Feel the air enter your nose.  Notice your chest expand as the air fills your lungs. Breathe out through your nose.  Feel your lungs emptying and your chest falling as the air exits your nose.  Do this for as long as you like. Leave the situation. Give the adrenaline time to normalize and observe the situation with a calmer, more rational perspective.    
The Sleep Depriver won’t let you turn off your mind at bedtime because it’s busy rehashing situations with “I should have” and “Why didn’t I?”, planning and ruminating on past, present, future and even some made up sh**.
When you’re ready for sleep and Depriver gets activated, go back to your conscious breathing technique and think: I am in control of my mind and I choose silence.
The Bottom Line

You have to stop letting your thoughts control you, make your life miserable and small.  Reprogram your mind by applying the following steps EVERY SINGLE TIME you have a negative thought.

Watch the thought arise and immediately think to yourself “Stop.  I am in control now and I will not be disrespected!”  Breathe deeply and slowly a few times to lower the adrenaline and take your focus off your thoughts.

Ask yourself: What am I really reacting to?  How does it feel in my body?

Ask: Is this fact or opinion?  What’s a different way of looking at this? What would someone else say about this thought?  What advice would I give a friend if they were having these thoughts? 

Observe the language you use often: is it judgmental?  Critical? Unkind? Fearful? Insecure?  Remind yourself that the way you treat yourself is the way others will treat you.  

Consider the consequences: what will happen if I continue thinking like this?  How will my life be affected?  

Keep a journal of your progress, watch yourself reprogram your mind, heal it and make it more effective in every aspect of your life.  You’ll be more motivated to continue this process if you can see concrete evidence of your progress.",1572566737

It would be like giving her a taste of what she wants and then saying actually, I don't want you that way.

If you're not that good of friends, still be upfront with her right away. Only follow this advice if sex is something that just happened naturally, and if that happens definitely discuss it with her. You don't want to be on two different pages! It can really suck. 

Also, make sure you emphasize that it isn't just her you dont want a relationship with, that you just don't want one right now or are not ready. 

AND make sure to discuss what happens if you guys want to see other people, if this is an exclusive thing, and what happens if you want to start dating someone. A lot of people say they don't care if their friend sleeps with someone else too, but you have to keep in mind that raises the risks of getting an sti. Even if their very careful, sometimes sti's can get transmitted without the person knowing or showing symptoms at first or at all.",1572566737

Yes to the colon prep and/or stool softeners/laxatives (wish I'd known!).

Your body will tell you at first what it can and cannot do. Take special care on the days you're feeling perkier and pain-free -- that's when you need to remind yourself to move slowly, deliberately.

Sounds like you're well-informed, but in case no one's mentioned, your abdominal cavity will have been pumped with air during surgery. In the days following, you will feel sharp little stabby 'gas' pains all-around your upper body (including up in your shoulders) as it shifts and dissipates. It can feel more intense than the surgical pain, so just be forewarned. Nothing you can't handle, and nothing to worry about, though!

"DebateACatholic","t5_2teju","I'll shoot my shot, but I'm not completely positive on some of these things.

1. Assuming that ""alter Christus"" is Latin for ""another Christ"", I don't think that it literally means that these priests become Christ themselves, but rather they are used as a willing vessel through which God can give sacraments. 
2. Mortal sin is, according to the Catechism,  ""sin whose object is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent."" This means that it has to be serious, meaning something like murder or adultery, so not something small, it has to be done with full knowledge, meaning you know the gravity of the sin, and you have to willingly intend to do the act. By categorizing it only as ""willing sin"", you aren't quite getting the full picture.
3. This is part of a Marian Consecration, in other words, consecrating yourself to God through Mary. While it may seem like you're worshipping Mary, I'd describe it more like Mary is the magnifying glass that we use to focus in on a particular spot, this spot being God and Jesus. One site about the consecration says this; ""Our act of consecration to Jesus through Mary centers ultimately on the Sacred Heart of our Lord.  Mary, as the Mother of Christ, is wholly united to Jesus' redemptive mission. As at the wedding feast of Cana, when she said “Do whatever he tells you”, Mary directs all things to her Son, who answers our prayers and forgives our sins. Thus *by dedicating ourselves to the heart of Mary, we discover a sure way to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and grow more in communion with the merciful love of our Saviour.""* Again, I wouldn't consider this worship, as we don't regard her as the supreme being, but rather the mother of our Savior, and we are both grateful and in awe of her because of what she did to serve God. If you take these things about Mary and apply them to the Rosary, it's not too surprising that we'd love to have Mary focus in our prayers.
4. You simply pray to saints, in other words doing something equivalent to asking your friends to pray for you, and then you pray your own prayers to God.",1572566741

B3) **Wait 24 hours** from this post to make another unless this post or the next is prearranged with a particular lender

B4) **Vet your lenders! Be careful who you send your personal information to** A) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. B) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately C) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?). Ultimately, you are free to accept loans from any user though you do so at your own risk. Loans made with ineligible/banned users will not be tracked by LoansBot and you will not get credit for loans fulfilled by ineligible lenders, so proceed at your own risk

B5) Understand and properly use all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

LENDERS:

L1) **Please read** all of our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/index) and [Lender FAQ's](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lenders)

L2) **Vet your borrowers!** A) See items 2 and 3 right below, B) Check for any past REQ posts and scan the comments for red flags, C) Check the [UniversalScammerList](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php), D) Install [RedditScamLabeler](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/ad10kg/meta_reddit_scam_labeler_extension_v15_update/) to your browser, E) Install this quick [karma-earning investigation tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/8gb6a8/metabookmarklet_to_help_identify_karma_farming/) to your browser, F) See these lists of sketchy user behaviors: [""Karma farmers""](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/9htkug/meta_be_aware_recent_influx_here_of_bot_managed/), [How to identify high risk borrowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/5n4rei/meta_lenders_how_to_identify_users_who_are_likely/)

L3) Check to see if Dylan8932 has a [**Post Deletion History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrowdeletes/search?q=Dylan8932&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L4) Check Dylan8932's [**Spam History**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/search?q=Dylan8932&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on), [**RedditMetis profile**](https://www.redditmetis.com/user/Dylan8932), or [**Atomiks Analyzer Profile**](https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#Dylan8932), or [Redetective profile](https://www.redective.com/) [**!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gcdeletes+gcremoves+gcmirror+gcarchive+gcalerts/search?q=Dylan8932&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)

L5) **We have a [Rule 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/cz5myt/meta_new_rule_concerning_lending_to_borrowers/) that requires new lenders to contact existing lenders holding late debt to OK providing more funds to this post author (borrower). Please adhere to this rule or you will be banned!** Additionally, it is suggested that lenders take into account a user’s **current open loans and repayment history when considering funding a loan**. This includes a) do they have any repayment history? Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

L6) Understand and [properly use](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/comments/6a624m/meta_the_usage_model_for_the_loan_command/) all [LoansBot commands](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoansBot/comments/2ea912/loansbot_basic_usage/) to mark loan status

In school we learned about LGB specific care but almost nothing about trans and NB. I want to make sure that my practice is trans welcoming so everyone can feel comfortable getting their preventative medicine and every day health needs met. I'd hate to think someone was neglecting their health because they felt uncomfortable or their provider didn't know how to help them.",1572566742
