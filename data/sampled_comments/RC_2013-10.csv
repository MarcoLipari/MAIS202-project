 And also reloading would take at least twice as long, plus all the fumbling around you will do when you don't have a free hand. 
 That being said, I would try it. Because why the hell not? Also, it might intimidate your opponents l.

Those costs will be offloaded from the tax-payers onto the tax-payers (through the insurance companies).

I had to carry all the tents for a fifteen person hike one session and I had a bad back so I had some icy hot. We get to the camp site, cook the food, hang around and I'm tired so I tell the co counselor to put up the bear bag, he agrees. I throw all the trash, leftover food and toothbrush/toothpaste/icy hot, in the bag and I go to bed. Cut to like three hours later, I wake up to a bear going through the bear bag which the co counselor left immediately in front of my tent. I stay still and figure I'm gonna have to scare it off somehow. As I'm waiting to see if it will just run away or get aggressive I see it go from hungry to sick and it starts gagging kinda. I put my head down and it stops messing around and I'm so relieved I fall asleep. I get woken up by my co counselor (who I'm very upset with) laughing his ass off. I get up and look out the tent to see him standing next to a pile of bear puke that must have been up  to his knees, and poking right out the top was my icy hot, the rest of the food hadn't been touched.

Not only is she always in bot lane, where she's guaranteed to be up against a ranged champ, her plants also last longer than the five seconds Yorick's ghouls last, giving the ADC plenty of time to work in autos in between last hitting.

How would Lee Sin ""easily oneshot the ghouls""? By using his Q and E?

So... you're just going to let Lee waste both his damage-spells, and not punish him? If he has the freedom to use his spells for 5 gold, you've already lost the lane, sorry to say.

Also, GP already gets the bonus for killing the ghouls, so you're in the exact same spot as before minus the five gold. 


Even if the FIVE gold did matter, why is it so bad that you have to strategically drop your ghouls now instead of just spamming them? Drop them when there's no chance they'll get the gold, or drop them when they'll take an extra hit by doing so. Drop the ghouls and chase after them so that if they stop you bash their skull in with your shovel. You should already be denying so many minions that the ghouls are the only thing they can get. Not only do the ghouls do damage, but instead of getting those 17g for killing a caster minion, they get five gold for killing the ghoul instead.

Because you're YORICK. You stand in the minionwave. And you bash in anyone's skull that gets close. Yorick won't stop being used because the enemy gets a 100 gold for free after the laning phase. Man up and let them have the five gold. Laugh in their faces, because those five gold are the only gold they're going to get. ","1380585609"

If you own a lot or are looking to buy one for this purpose, call (preferably go in person) your jurisdiction's Zoning Office and ask if it is allowed. Very often certain zones have minimum house sizes required to keep uniformity in areas / neighborhoods, but there should be some that would allow it. Ask them.

Also keep in mind that zoning regulations can be bent / modified by Zoning Variances or Zoning Adjustments. This process may take many months because it requires hearings and review processes.

Best of luck!

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","The basis of your (top level: sigh) critique was, you explained, ""The title is disingenuous, is all.""

The NYT article's 1st &amp; 4th paragraphs:

&gt;Since 2010, the National Security Agency has been exploiting its huge collections of data to create sophisticated graphs of some Americans’ social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information, according to **newly disclosed documents and interviews** with officials...

&gt;The agency can augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including **bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as property records and unspecified tax data,** according to the documents. They do not indicate any restrictions on the use of such “enrichment” data, and several former senior Obama administration officials said the agency drew on it for both Americans and foreigners.

The OP's Title: 

&gt;NEW SNOWDEN LEAK: NSA gathers bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls, GPS location and more...

So, *every* word in the title is taken from the NYT article.

Do you think the NSA is behaving properly in gathering such widespread, vast stores of information on Americans (especially ones not suspected, let alone charged)? Were they honest to us or their supposed oversight committees? 

Is gathering and archiving everything that's done online advisable? Let's assume you trust Obama (or Romney). How about the next guy? 

More broadly, how many of the big terrorist attacks (9/11 through Boston) were caught by this widespread spying on innocent civilians? How many trillions have been spent on this? If none of these violations resulted in stopping these attacks, then isn't it a waste? A fraud? 

Your key point, ""ZOMG, inaccurate title!!,"" would be, if accurate, pedantic, given the topic, the article and its implications. The fact that your key point is demonstrably **false** makes it... Well, something worse than that.

Look, I understand. Some of us are simply wired to defer to authority. It's comforting. That's fine. But for something like this, which *will* be cemented into place forever unless we beat this back this year, these unconscious instincts need to be carefully examined.

This might be one of those cases for you to try.","1380585612"

Heck, most workers today have lived during higher unemployment than the current recession, so (as usual) you have no point.

And, as I expected, you provide zero stats. Owned again. Your position is based on ignorance and sound bites, not reality. The fact remains people do get jobs, can save for retirement, and can get enough education to get decent pay.

""Citrus"" by Asobi Seksu is probably my favorite shoegaze album of that decade.  All the songs are top notch and hit the right notes at the right times.

Strong claim!

&gt;Which lift ( split or squat) jerk has a higher probability of success ?

For most lifters, the split jerk does.

&gt;Does the slim margin of error on the squat outweigh the depth you can reach!

Probably.

&gt;What about the stability of the split jerk?

It's superior!

But more seriously, those are very strong conjectures you're putting out. Remember, the split snatch turned into the squat snatch because height of the pull was a very important factor in the Snatch. More so than balance, so squat out-did split. 

 On the other-hand, jerks don't require as much height as a clean, or snatch, so it's a different story. The ""idea"" is, the weight you could clean, you could drive up to split jerk height, at least for general population. So, because height of the bar is not as valuable in jerk, oppose to balance, trading it off for the squat style instead of the split may not happen.

*May* being a very important, key word. ","1380585619"

However after looking at a few of these other ones I wish I knew they existed before, I did not find them bad at all.

I knew MSY existed but in my experience MSY has the right price but the wrong attitude, I went there to get a new Graphics card the other day and when I had to exchange it, it took them 2 hours to run an exchange had to exchange because it was for my mini ITX box and the card they tried to sell me had 3 prongs which wouldn't fit in my case, they had no issue with the exchange but the fact that they had no idea how to process it was confusing as hell and that it takes so long to get service from their canberra store.  so I lined up for 25-30 minutes initially then I had to come back and line up again (I walked to my car realised my part was wrong and walked back in) then had to wait another hour while they were trying to figure out how to run the exchange, and rather than just asking me to pay the $28 difference for the new crard they charged me the full price then gave me cash in return. So I have been turned off them for a while plus the store used to be layed out better (in my opinion) because you could walk around and pick up the pieces which you want, I.E. they had the things on shelves but now they have it all behind so I can't even go in have a sticky spend my time looking at the parts which I might want to buy then choose to buy them, I now have to go in knowing exactly what I want before I go in.

They got what was coming to them; the kid that got caught ended up getting busted with coke and having a kid. Eventually word got out about the goody two shoes really being scumbags.

There is also no ""evidence"" of chemicals *not* being sprayed. In fact, if you bother to look at all of your old photographs, the persistent, spreading ""contrails"" of today simply are not in your old photographs. The contrast between the way the skies looked on an average day before and after the turn of the century means it is more likely that something is being sprayed that is a **classified** project (i.e. ~ you aren't important enough to inform). The fact that many of the planes do not show up on flight tracking software further supports the theory that spraying is taking place, rather than the natural conditions for contrail formation changing.

Meta Answer: The previous threads stipulated that Quote was immune to energy loss by injury, and the arms barrier is in his inventory in this match as a compromise between the two(it halves energy lost to attacks).

My views of Fox come mostly from when I go to extremist family member's houses and the few times I see it at work on the TV they have outside our elevators in the lobby. My problem is probably that I am mostly liberal. I don't mean to assume this, but I swear they are the ones who use ""liberal"" as a dirty word judging by what I've seen from them and their viewer's habit of having no clue what the word means (along with other words like socialism and communism). I just feel like everything they ever say is extremely right-wing, and that makes me furious not only because I don't agree with it, but because it's not news. It's opinion.

AS this video points out, cognitive dissonance can be...uncomfortable.  And denial is one way to avoid this discomfort.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","There is evidence in non-REM sleep (i.e. unconsciousness, but without anesthesia) that the brain takes in stimuli and the area of the brain dedicated to the processing of those stimuli is activated in a similar pattern to that of an awake brain. However, researchers found that the usual patterns of communication between that specific area and other information processing areas are absent. 

This find suggests that neither the eyes nor the brain 'shut-off,' rather the information is processed, but not shared with the rest of the brain. 

As other users have commented, the specific effects of different drugs vary, but this may be a useful way to understand what is going on.

"druidism","t5_2u3r5","Woo, those are some simple questions with not so simple answers :) it's very hard to describe Druidry because it's different for everyone. It has no rules or requirements except a love and respect for nature. You do not have to believe in gods or goddesses, karma or an afterlife or reincarnation. It is all up to preferences of the individual. Different organizations and groves will sometimes have moral guidelines, but there is no large overlaying sort of code of conduct. People may have altars if they wish, they may worship gods or goddesses or only one god or goddess or none at all, they can follow whatever culture for influence they like, they can celebrate whatever holidays they like (though most do follow the 8 Sabbats). Some believe in and practice magic, some do not. It's whatever feels right for you.

This is a very good blog article that I think accurately describes the basic mentality of Druidry and most Druids http://philipcarrgomm.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/does-god-exist-and-the-crowning-achievement-of-druidry/

These are also some good sites to view:

http://druidnetwork.org/what-is-druidry/

http://www.druidry.org/druid-way/what-druidry

Some people who need a bit more structure to their spiritual practices will mix Druidism with other religions, such as other Pagan religions (like Wicca or Arastu), or even Abrahamic religions like Christianity","1380585638"

The seats were not singled out so instead of this: l__l__l they were like this: l____l. The bus is packed and the only seat left is next to an Indian man who looks like he's in his late 20's sporting a grumpy look and using his legs to take up 20% of my consensual 50% leaving me with 30% to rest my weary legs. I decided to not be phased by his bad manners (stiff upper lip) and tried to take full advantage of my seating situation. Yeah my leg was kind of pressed up against his but its not gay if its petty. So my asian brother starts shooting me mean looks I can see out the corner of my eye. I turn to my right, he had a window seat, and I sort of shoot off a puzzled look with a ""hmm""? He replies ""vat are you doing?"" I reply ""fuck you"". He uses his right hand to attempt to punch me in my cocky teenage face but fails. I grab his right hand with my left as if we were playing mercy and posture up to rain hellfire on his face. After a few seconds I heard a pop, saw I drew blood from his face and let go and backed off. His left hand immediately grabbed his right hand where his middle finger was was snapped in one place and just hanging there. He then turned his head to look out of the fucking window miserably as if I'd just divorced him.
Any impact on my life is probably positive. Stand up for yourself and all that good stuff.","1380585638"

"BMW","t5_2qn3a","ok, the o2 sensor value shouldn't cause huge drivebility issues in the short term. You could unplug the harness and see if that affects anything. I would assume that it wouldn't, if it's already gone bad. In any case, I'd suggest replacing the sensor. They tend to go bad after about 100k mi, I think.

Lambda fault code might be related to the o2 sensor, but I'd assume that you are tripping that code due to unburned fuel from misfires. This is a symptom, not a cause. I would still start at the ignition system.  

Do what the code book tells you: 

&gt;Start the car and let it run for 30 seconds; Turn off car and let it sit for another 30 seconds; Perform diagnostic test again; If the same flash code re-appears DME should be replaced

If it really is bad, a DME isn't that expensive from a forum like r3vlimited. Maybe 40-50 bucks for a stock 173. 

one last thing...how badly carboned were your plugs before you cleaned them? You might be running a rich air/fuel mixture over a long period of time due to the bad o2 sensor. That would cause build up on your plugs, eventually causing a misfire. Like I said before, swap in brand new plugs and see what happens. It could be that you don't actually need a new coil, but rather your plugs are so badly fouled that it is causing a weak spark and misfires under load. ","1380585638"

I did not pay the land owners for right-of-ways for the power line, but I most certainly paid the power company.   

I didnt pay for the road, but I paid a gasoline tax that goes to build it.   In the absence of a gasoline tax I'd pay a toll, or a membership fee, or I'd find an alternative mode of transport.   When prices are too high, people find alternatives.  Its call substitution effect, and it happens in economics all the time.

And at this point, I would like to bring up an interesting anecdote (for the funny) related to this story when it was reported by Fox; they claimed that it was biased because of the university where it was produced. However, the university did not actually do the study, just a think tank located near it but not actually a part of the university. Thus demonstrating that Fox reporting does, in fact, tend to leave its viewers misinformed. It is also interesting to note that someone fairly high up at Fox News graduated from that university.","1380585639"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","With very little exception, ALL of the wholesalers (Priceline, Expedia, Hotels.com, etc.) get the same price. I worked in reservations/front desk/concierge/PBX for years and it was the same routine every day - you send out the same damn prices for ALL the companies. More likely than not, if the hotel is listed on multiple websites, none will have a better rate than the others. 

But to add to that, you can almost always get a better rate by calling the hotel directly and talking to a person who works on-site. This was 100% true for me in Scottsdale, AZ, with the exception of peak (Roughly the beginning of January through the middle of May, but that's because we were primarily golf suites and hosted a lot of large groups for BCS, Phoenix Open, the Arabian Horse Show and then spring training, in addition to large golf groups. I would wager that a lot of AZ resorts don't have as long of an ""in season"").

Reservations agents that are in-house are generally given carte blanche in regards to giving shit away. We were constantly told that we could do ""whatever was necessary to fill rooms""... within reason.

"disney","t5_2qh8g","This is a cute true story about Ron Miller, son-in-law to Walt Disney.  Ron was part of the leadership team who helped launch the Florida Project.  For the two weeks prior to Walt Disney World's soft opening in 1971, Miller was in Japan, already laying the groundwork for Tokyo Disneyland.  As a result, he almost missed the soft opening.  Coming over from the airport in the helicopter around 7 a.m., Ron noticed a line of bumper-to-bumper traffic on the one road heading into the property.  Thinking he'd missed a memo, he radioed the corporate office saying this ""Hey guys, did I miss something?  This was supposed to be a soft opening, 500 invitations.  I got nothing but traffic here.""    
    
Realizing for the first time the scope of what they'd done in that swamp in Florida, he heard this reply, ""Boss, those aren't people coming to the opening.  Those are your employees trying to get to work.""

One of Litecoin's core goals is efficiency.  If you ran a business, would you waste your accountant's time tracking millions of transactions a thousandth or millionth of a dollar in value?  It makes no sense for everyone to bear the costs of storing these many meaningless microtransactions in a global ledger forever.

Litecoin is NOT for microtransactions.  If you want microtransactions you either want an offchain tx processor or another alt coin.  For example, Bitcoin is a good choice for microtransactions with many recipients.","1380585655"

A month later my parents get divorced, and a month later my mom, little brother, and I moved, a month later I started high school. I look almost identical to my mother and (I think for that reason) my dad was an absolute dick to me. He would take my brother to do stuff, he would ignore my phone calls, just be an absolute shit head until I finally called him up one day and told him to go fuck himself. 

Fast forward to my last semester of college: My dad and I talk often, he comes and visits, pays for some stuff of mine, he's really trying. 

Secret: I hate him for treating me like shit. I can't get over it. I know at this point it's stupid to still be mad but no matter what I just really want to scream at him and tell him how terrible of a father he was and what a pathetic excuse of a man he is.

If bitcoin drops 50% in a day (not unlikely) and someone with substantial holdings cashs out on that very day, the bank will either need to cover this until bitcoin rises, or sell at a lose. I'm not saying people will cash out during the flucuations but it is highly likely that this will occur. 
Other than this, why would anyone be willing to deposit funds into a bank that converts their Cash(Stable) into bitcoins(risky) to safe guard their funds? I see this as a silly proposition, it would be like me offering that I will hold their cash and invest it in exploration mining stocks, and then saying don't worry if this doesn't pan out your money is safe. 
If bitcoin steadily rises and they gain enough backing they will be fine, if it drops heavily in the first year of adoption this venture will most likely fail.

If you go the other route and open a normal, restricted-access terminal, whenever you try to run an admin command you get reminded, and then you can just quickly sudo to repeat the command, and then you're back to restricted mode afterwards. So this method gives you more safety and convenience—you can't accidentally make admin changes, and you don't have to keep manually point-and-clicking ""Run as administrator"" to open new terminals.

They must advance it at least ten yards in four downs to receive a new set of four downs and continue the drive; if not, they turn over the ball to the opposing team. Points are scored by advancing the ball into the end zone for a touchdown, kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal or by the defense tackling the ball carrier in the offense's end zone for a safety.","1380585662"

"Seahawks","t5_2ryle","Anyone who thinks Unger being out didn't affect last game isn't playing with a full deck. Centers have shared responsibility for calling line protections and All-Pro centers prioritize who and how to block better than back up centers. I wish I had time to trawl through tape and irrefutably repudiate stuff like this, but instead I'll just have to be annoyed.

Remember that play when Cushing flew in untouched and blasted Marshawn to cause a fumble? Without going back and watching the tape to strengthen my intuition one way or another, there's a good chance Lem was partly responsible for that. The problem is, the center's job is subtle and as fans we can't always pin the failures on him without more information. Nevertheless, when a team loses a starting center in the middle of the season, you'll almost always notice a mysterious drop in offensive efficiency -- a lot like what we saw on Sunday.

http://beta.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2007/01/a_center_shall_lead_them.html

If the drop off in play between Unger and Lem, against by some measures the second best defense in the NFL, is no big deal, we could have saved a lot of money by not extending Unger. Instead we made him one of the highest paid centers in the NFL.","1380585663"

I placed that link there so you could read the report for yourself. The reason why is because it is far more relevant than some Belgian statistic or an anecdote from Iran.

If you're too lazy to read the 310-page report, this paragraph sums their finding on visible religious symbols adequately:

«Concernant le port de signes religieux par les agents de l'État: qu'il soit interdit aux magistrats et procureurs de la Couronne, aux policiers, aux gardiens de prison, aux présidents et vice-présidents de l'Assemblée nationale; qu'il soit autorisé aux enseignants, aux fonctionnaires, aux professionnels de la santé et à tous les autres agents de l'État.»

The rationale is that no one who holds coercive power (i.e., violence, imprisonment, etc.) over a citizen should be allowed to wear a religious symbol, and I generally agree with this conclusion.

&gt; Drôle que tu enlève la symbolique religieuse et politique du voile. C'est loin d'être simplement culturel.

1iii)Now reload the torrent files either by a) redownloading them from the sites/ trackers where you got them and adding them to your webui PAUSED or NOT STARTING or b) by moving them (using the FTP client) from wherever they still are, IF they are there, to the watch folder of your new client  (e.g. in rtorrent/torrents to deluge/watch) but with your download speed cut to 1 kb/s so you don't re-download everything by mistake. Option b might be possible if you installed client Y without uninstalling client X or if Client X kept a copy of all the torrent files.

1iv)Then recheck everything if it does not do so automatically. When everything checks to 100% you are good to seed.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You are under the basis that homosexuality is not a sin, so this conversation can not work.

Obviously, if homosexuality is not a sin, then the church is handling it in a completely wrong way, and no one would argue and say that they are handling it the right way.

If you are under the assumption that it *is* a sin, then it needs to be treated like any other sin out there.  The way Christians need to treat sin is talking about it, and confronting other people who are claiming to be Christian, yet are ok with that sin in their life.  Obviously in a specific way, you don't just run up to someone and start yelling at them.

But if I had a friend who told me about how drunk he got last night, and how he slept with this hott chick, I would let him know that I don't agree with that, and that if he claims to be a Christian he should really stop doing those things.

If I had a friend tell me the same thing, except it was with another guy, I would tell him the same thing.

Do you see what I am trying to say?

A sin is still a sin, even if the person believes it's not a sin.  If they are claiming to be a Christian, then they need to be treated as such.

BPA (and similar chemicals) acts like an estrogen in the body - messing with normal hormonal signals is bad for a lot of reasons.

Eating canned food every once in a while is probably fine because your body gets rid of them fairly quickly.  That said,  a can a day (not to mention other canned foods) will probably accumulate relatively high levels.

However, if a seat is out of your price range, you still might be able to get one for your lap infant. If you haven't selected your seats already,  and you're flying alone with baby, then pick a middle seat in a three person row closest to the bathroom with the changing table (some airline sites tell you this info, sometimes you have to call)--this will be handy for multiple reasons. If you're flying as a couple with baby, select the aisle and window seats in a three across row (also as close to the changing table as possible). If the flight's not full, the gate agent may be able to arrange for you to use the unoccupied seat for baby--make nice when you check in. 

Another strategic location is the furthest aft seats, especially if they're near the galley/bathrooms. Since it's a high traffic area, people often don't want to sit there.

GGPO's savestate or implimentation of the emulator has really bad desync problems, so the easiest way to play on there is actually to play Hyper SF2 and only pick HF versions of the characters. I also find Supercade works best with close opponents and GGPO with those further away, so I've had pretty bad luck playing HF there. There was an SRK tournament about a month ago, check the bracket [here](http://challonge.com/sf2hfstarcup), but the game is not particularly lively in North America.

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","If you're just starting programming then I suggest using whatever environment you're most comfortable with. Learning to program is difficult enough by itself without adding learning an entirely new environment on top of it. If you're most comfortable with Linux, then use Linux. After you get some basic competence you can experiment with other environments to see if they offer you any benefit. 

Linux has some nice features as a development platform, but you're not likely to see or understand them at the level you'll be working at. Starting out in Windows is much the same as starting out in Linux. You'll be banging your head against the wall with syntax issues and programming errors more than you'll be fighting against the OS.

As someone who's been programming for 15+ years (over half my life) you reach a point where the development OS is really not that important. The vast majority of things that are nice about Linux from a development stance can be replicated in other OS's with a little know-how and some googling. And if you're writing real software (i.e. software that is distributed to end-users) then you'll want to develop in whatever your most important target platform is anyway (whether you like it or not). For example, you're making cross-platform software but 80% of your user-base is using Windows, developing primarily in Windows is a no-brainer.

As for Apple, that just serves to prove my point. In the beginning, they were the only game in town. One company, MSFT, completely blew them off. So tell me, what do the market share numbers look like now, 5 years later? Android's got 83%, and Apple only has 13%. When a new market is shown to be a good business proposition, there will be competition.

we know that honey bee queens and brood are capable of suppressing worker ovary development through the release of various pheromones. Is it necessarily altruistic if the workers don't have a choice in the matter? What kind of implications does this type of behavior have on the proposed development of sociality?

I've used the random hero box thrice, and thrice I've received an awesome hero: Cable, Emma Frost, and Deadpool.

now I can't say how much of that play time was prior to the splinter patch, but no more than 1/2 of that, so in 40 hours I've gotten 3 more heroes in addition to the 2 i got from the old style rewards (that's 6 heroes total).

in a few years (as you say) there will be (estimate) 50+ heroes, and of course the drop rate will become better.  As is stands right now, there are only so many heroes you can have, and their only way of making money is selling those heroes and their costumes.

i get it, you think that because *you* are immature and pout about your bad luck, that Gaz should cater to the lowest common denominator.

you do know that Gaz has to *pay* for the license to use a Marvel hero, right?  They're not free and any money they make is pure profit, right?  a quick internet search for licencing fees shows marvel heroes' *names* alone cost $15,000 a piece and 10% off the top of any sales from that name.

Again, I get it, you have zero idea what it takes to make a game, so you're upset that Gaz doesn't let themselves go bankrupt to give you all of the heroes.  Their game is not like the old games, when free to play wasn't in existance, but i can tell you that their constant updating of content isn't going to stop anytime soon, and they can just as easily make things drop more or less often at their whim.

Just give it up, if you don't like the game, leave, uninstall it, and be done with it.  There isn't anyone telling you you need to squash other's enjoyment of the game.

I know it's heartbreaking to think about having to delay it more, but I'd really think about giving yourself some time if you're questioning the relationship right now. If having a child is important to both of you, maybe make some relationship goals and give yourselves some time to fix them before you start trying.

So when the Spanish flooded the Chinese market with cheap silver after discovering Cerro de Potosi, the Chinese just imagined their market completely collapsing, even though back then they had no idea what a functioning economy was anyways?

Inflation is very real. It is basically devaluing your assets, because you have no real valuables. If inflation continues, YOU ARE LOSING YOUR LIVELIHOOD. You can adjust prices to match inflation, but that can only go so far, and prices/wages never adjust fast enough. The problem is that there's so much credit, but absolutely nothing to back it up. What happens when these lenders decide to cash out? Do you think the USA can just print more money, and then the lenders will also dump the money back into the economy, wtf happens to my money?

Do you think my 9 mil will still be able to buy a bunch of land? 

Nobody actually wants the US to go into economic depression. All those lenders would then be holding valueless assets. A bunch of paper.

Our entire society is held up by ""thinking"" something is the way it is, so that's the way it is. That is the problem. Except when what you think and what reality presents coincide, then the problems start coming out.

What is money worth? Nothing. Only assets back up money, and if the US doesn't have enough to back it up, which it doesn't, then it can only depend on war or complete withdrawl because jobs can't be paid, and people start to migrate. ","1380585687"

I'll start with how it affected me academically, since thats about the only positive...  

I was a boss the first three years of college.  I studied engineering (always had a STEM aptitude in school) and most courses where everyone else was struggling I somehow passed with flying colors while exerting significantly less effort than other students.  I remember studying maybe 1-2 hours for exams and getting a 95 while my friends who spent an entire weekend studying scraped by with a 68.  The only reason I didn't continue this through senior year was because I got lazy and demotivated (see social effects) and kinda just stopped trying.  Even with no effort (as opposed to minimal effort) I still managed to pass every class and graduated with a 3.7  final GPA.  

I finished the equivalent of high school when I was 15.  The last two years at home I spent studying college level material (physics and chemistry) with my father (phd in chemistry) and taking first or second year general education courses at a community college.  I'll also add that I scored over 2100 on the SAT (really useful for scholarships).

Ok that sounds far too positive.  How about the social effects...?

The way I see it I got FUCKED OVER.  It's possible that a lot of my problems are personal, and not attributable to homeschooling but I really have no baseline to compare to as I'm the only child in my family exclusively homeschooled.  Both of my brothers were only homeschooled through 8th grade.  

I've always been a pretty shy person, but I think the isolation of homeschooling prevented me from learning the tools to deal with the problem in social situations.  I had a couple friends I met at our church who went to the high school, but that was it.  I didn't really try to make any other friends because I literally had nothing to say to people I didn't know.  To this day I don't even know how I became friends with those two people, it remains a mystery to me.  I'd like to think if I had been enrolled in a school with other kids I might have overcome some of this.  I still have a lot of trouble talking to people I don't know.  I have really poor conversational skills and generally try to avoid people.

My parents never really talked to me about dating or girls and that stuff.  Since all of my siblings are guys that ended up being a major setback.  I thought I had trouble talking with other guys I didnt know.  Boy oh boy was I in for a surprise when I went to college.  You ever watch Big Bang Theory?  if so you can probably guess which character I'm like.  I never had an opportunity to take someone out on a date much less even talk to a girl and learn well...whatever the fuck it is that people learn that ends up getting them in a relationship  I still don't know it and now I'm so far removed from the people that do I'm practically terrified of it.

The worst part?  I don't want to change.  I'm afraid of working on these social problems because I have no idea what to do.  I feel like I missed the boat and its too late.  And that only makes them worse.  I realize it, but the sad thing is I'd rather hole up in my apartment after I get off work than go out and try to meet people because I just, dont, know, what the fuck, to do.  

I blame most of this on being homeschooled, but maybe deep down inside I'm just a wimp, idk.  I've always heard that homeschooling can cause social development problems and I think I might be a severe case.

Ok that was far too negative.  What about some other effects.

Well for one, while most kids my age were waking up at 6:00 to make it to school and not getting home until 3:30 and having homework on top of that I had it pretty easy.  I got to sleep until 7-8 and usually finished all the schoolwork for the day before 1:00.  And no ""homework"" for me, because that would just be silly.  It was kinda nice finishing and having a good 8 hours left in the day to do anything I wanted (what I would give to be a kid again...).  

As a result of all this extra free time I developed a lot of skills that most other kids/teens didnt have the time for.  I learned a ton about electronics from tinkering with them.  I spent a ton of time working on engines and learning how to fix cars.  I also had time to work 30 hours a week once I was 14 and by the time I was 16 had enough money to buy a vehicle outright with my own money.  Speaking of which I spent even more time working on and upgrading said vehicle (which I still own!).

Because we got to pick our own schedule (well, whatever my parents thought was good) we got to go on a lot more trips than publicly schooled kids.  Camping trip in September?  No problem we'll just take a couple weeks off school.  Relatives coming to visit?  I guess we can resume school once they leave.

Thats the highlights of my experience, at least what comes to mind right now.  Feel free to ask any followup questions because...well I ain't got shit else to do.  

In closing I would recommend homeschooling to people if and only if the public schools available are extremely lacking.  and even then for the love of god dont homeschool your kids their entire life and then throw them under the bus that is life.","1380585688"

I figure those are solvable with more thorough duplicate-checking, although this is probably horribly inefficient - something like a for loop that'll go through each element of week and compare them to the randomized name would do it.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Racism is what stopped us. The southern strategy that the right fully committed to under Nixon switched the entire blue as HELL south to Red. When the first world was embracing universal health care that we helped start in motion with Medicare, we were in the middle of desegregation and the political fallout from dealing with it.

The southern right took over the deep blue south with code words about ""government power"" when talking about desegregation and leaning on the idea that poor, uneducated blacks were getting paid to do nothing. Then just like now, only far far worse, you had members of congress who wanted to shout the N word but instead said ""welfare"" and they had constituents that were just fine shouting the N word. Now, they have to pretend a bit more and their constituents even have to a little, but we're only 40 years from that which is an eye blink in terms of social evolution.

I personally believe Obama was the lance that allowed the last bit of puss to drain out of the south. He took over the worst economy since FDR and righted the ship. The true racists hate him, but average folks and definitely future historians will view him at least as competent. Especially because of Bush.

&gt; Thousands of homeowners who lost brick chimneys in the Jan. 17 earthquake will be forced to rebuild them under stringent new guidelines that are likely to lead to the use of substitute materials, Los Angeles building officials said Tuesday.

&gt; An ordinance approved by the City Council requires homeowners to hire an engineer, use steel reinforcement and anchor their chimneys to the frames of their homes.

&gt; ""What this is going to do, for all practical purposes, is outlaw (the rebuilding of) brick chimneys in this city,"" said Warren O'Brien, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. ""It's just not practical in earthquake country.""

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;I haven't cited wikipedia as a ""source"" or provided an alternative, credible one because when it comes to Canaanite religion, there is only one source. One set of texts.

That is pure, unadulterated bullshit. And you know it. Egyptian, Ugarit, various letters and steles, glyphs on pottery. We have way more than one set of sources. And a ton of secondary sources all involved with interpreting them. 

&gt;But of course, you didn't know that. Because you're reliant on wikipedia for your ""information"".

Then you won't have too much trouble coughing that ""set of texts"" up, will you? Also, I believe I've offered the write up on the Ugarit sources by Prof. Mark Smith, not just wikipedia. 

&gt;Again, I've already explained why the Canaanite pantheon can't be the source of YHWH.

You have done no such thing. You said that the Canaanite pantheon was predominately influenced from other major civilizations, and that YHWH cannot be traced to these same origins. That's a universally accepted notion. But the notion that YHWH is dissimilar to gods with Babylonian or Egyptian origins proves nothing about YHWH's own region of origin. You have not shown that YHWH is more or less from Canaan than any other god. 

&gt;And yet again. It's clear that the Canaanites appropriated YHWH just like they did with virtually ALL their deities.

Ok, now you're getting tautological by expanding the scope of your assertion. ""YHWH is appropriated because ALL gods are appropriated, so no matter what I was originally saying, I'm still right!"". Yeah, no. That's a manipulative rhetorical tactic. 

&gt;I love it when someone talks themselves into an amazingly stupid argument then instead of simply apologizing and admitting they were wrong, decides to defend it to the hilt.

[AHAHAHAHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Colors). Look at the first US flag. No seriously, look at it. Union jack with stripes on it. Made by British citizens who didn't want to be British. The US wasn't even a nation at that point, just a bunch of rebellious British provinces. The first US flag was British. Your analogy was bad. Deal with it like a big boy. 

Also, do you know anything about ancient historiography at all? It's amazingly hard to label what group or culture different individuals belonged to. Why? Because when you cut out the propaganda and arbitrary city-state borders (as you failed to do with your terrible flag analogy) these lineages blend together. The people who made the first American flag *were originally British citizens, participating in British culture, speaking English, subject to the British crown, who had only the barest semblance of a separate cultural identity when they fought their civil war with Britain.* An ancient near-east historian, absent any precise, propaganda-free definition for what constitutes the beginning of ""America"", would simply call the whole thing ""Anglo culture"" until at least the 1780s and leave it at that. 

You've done a better job of making yourself look like an incompetent asshole than I ever could have.

"Dexter","t5_2rahc","1st third of Season 5:

- Jesse finds out that Walt Poisoned Brock.  He reacts by breaking into Walt's house.  Skyler and the kids are vacation in Orlando (where they seem to be every week for one reason or another).  Walt is home, though, and Jesse lights the whole house on fire.  They're surely going to die. Then, at the last minute, Jesse has second thoughts and drags Walt out of the house.   Walt and Jesse are now a-OK.

- Steve Gomez's long lost sister, Lenore, shows up.  Approximately 10 minutes per episode for the rest of season five will be dedicated to an odd-couple style sitcom scenario about Steve being a neat freak DEA agent and Lenore being a sloppy pot smoker, and them trying to be room mates.  This sub-plot will have nothing to do with the rest of the series.

- A new member joins the ABQ DEA.  His name is Dave.  Dave is a go-getter who happens to be of African-American descent.  He has snappy one-liners, but only gets about two lines per episode.  Approximately ten minutes per episode are dedicated to tense teleconferences between ASAC Schrader and his bosses in Washington, who are warning him if he keeps chasing this Heisenberg thing, he's going to be demoted.

-  Walt finds himself falling in love with Lydia, the lady who distributes their meth in the Czech republic.  This happens suddenly, without warning, as in, Walt and Lydia start making out during a meeting at the diner for no reason the audience can discern.  This, in spite of the fact that for the past four seasons, Walt has been obsessed with Skyler and his family, at least outwardly.

---

2nd Third of Season 5:

- Hank is demoted by DEA central command.  Dave, the snappy one-liner guy, is promoted to ASAC.  We never see Dave again.  Hank is now a regular DEA agent.  He becomes depressed, starts doing copious amounts of cocaine (despite the fact that he's a DEA agent), eventually quits the DEA and joins a private security firm (the guys that guard storage lockers) run by a character being played by guest star [Tony Danza](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Tony_danza_2012.jpg).

- Steve Gomez learns about himself as he tries to teach Lenore how to be responsible.

- Skyler and the kids are still in Orlando.  It's not explained why.

- Jesse's little brother, [Jake Pinkman](http://breakingbad.wikia.com/wiki/Jake_Pinkman), now eighteen (though he was like eleven last season), wants to get into the meth business.  Jesse at first wants to keep him out of it, then decides to take him on as a protege.  Several episodes focus on Jesse mentoring Jake, but then Jake gets hit by a bus.

-  Walt decides he's in love with Lydia, and wants to give her all of his meth money.  He just has to get it from his storage locker....

---

Final Third of Season 5

- It turns out that Jake Pinkman's death at the hands of the bus driver was no accident.  The bus driver is actually [Bogdan Wolynetz](http://breakingbad.wikia.com/wiki/Bogdan_Wolynetz), who, bitter with rage at having lost the car wash, wants to kill Jesse and Walt.  He mistook Jake for Jesse.  With four episodes left in the series, Bogdan is suddenly the main antagonist.

-  Hank trips and falls through the wall of a storage unti, Kool-Aid man style, and finds Walt's Meth money.  Hank calls Gomie, who still works for the DEA, and Walt's money is confiscated.  They trace the money to Lydia, and she goes on he run by boarding a bus from ABQ to Hawaii.

-  Walt traps Bogdan at the car wash, there's a showdown, Walt has Bogdan on his knees with a gun to his head.  Then Walt decides he has too much respect for Bogdan, and lets him go as long as he pinkie swears not to kill Walt, Walt's family, or Jesse.

- Bogdan kills Jesse *immediately*.

- Walt drops a piano on Bogdan.  No explanation for why the piano was there, it just happens.

-  Hank and Gomie commandeer a bus to follow Lydia's bus to Hawaii, and they're hot on her trail, but they accidentally decide to take a nap at the same time and end up in Alaska, so Lydia escapes.

- Walt is now out of the meth business, Bogdan is dead, Hank and Gomie are off of Lydia's trail, and Walt is free to join Lydia in Hawaii if he wants.  Instead, he goes to Ed the vacuum cleaner guy and gets set up with a new identity as a lumberjack in New Hampshire.

-  Skyler and the kids are still in Orlando.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","[Source](http://www.clublakers.com/lakers-discussion/shaq-free-throws-the-cause-for-them-t10732.html)

**Three years after achieving near-savior status among the Laker faithful, Ed Palubinskas is still proselytizing to the willing, adjusting elbows and calibrating release points, still trying to beautify the world, one free-throw stroke at a time.**

**For now, he would settle for fixing just one. But Shaquille O'Neal doesn't want his help.**

**Palubinskas, the self-proclaimed ""shooting surgeon,"" has watched his former pupil's shot deteriorate horribly and is, to say the least, dismayed.**

**O'Neal is shooting .281 from the foul line in the playoffs, the worst postseason percentage of his career and a far cry from the 60 percent rate he achieved with Palubinskas' help in 2001. In two games against the San Antonio Spurs, O'Neal has converted 5 of 20 free throws.**

**Each night, O'Neal's failure is broadcast to a national audience. From his home in Baton Rouge, La., a 53-year-old shooting guru with a faint Australian accent watches and despairs.** 

**""He's gone back to square one,"" Palubinskas said by phone. ""Worse. He's not remembering anything that we've done. The only thing he's doing is the beginning of the shot. The finish, the locking, the consistency, the weight displacement, the elbow, the forearm, back, all that stuff is forgotten. And by not having the monitoring and the follow-up, who's going to remind him of the little things that are crucial in success?""**

**The Lakers are down 2-0 in the conference semifinals, and with every loss O'Neal's foul shooting becomes a greater concern. But it goes largely unaddressed these days.**

**By the end of the 2000-01 season, team officials and O'Neal had both grown weary of the self-promoting Palubinskas. O'Neal shot .525 from the line in the playoffs that spring, an improvement over his prior three postseasons but still in the vicinity of his career average.**

**O'Neal has not employed another free-throw coach since then, choosing to work out his stroke himself. Team officials have practically given up trying to work with O'Neal on the issue.**

**""Shaq is not very movable on advice,"" coach Phil Jackson said last month. ""He's the one that gives himself advice. So we'll leave it with him.""**

**When Palubinskas' name comes up, O'Neal hisses.**

**""I don't need him, just like I don't need you asking me dumb questions,"" he said a few weeks ago.**

**Palubinskas, the former Olympian and Louisiana State star, begs to differ. He recalls with pride the night O'Neal went 13 for 13 against Portland in the final game of the 2001 regular season. O'Neal shot .615 after the All-Star break that year, a clear sign that Palubinskas' mentoring had taken hold.**

**Without anyone's help, O'Neal shot a career-best .622 in the 2002-03 regular season, reinforcing his belief that he can handle this on his own. (""Anyone can luck into something,"" Palubinskas said.)**

**But the more Palubinskas watches, the more he talks about it, the more frustrated he becomes.**

**""It's just sad,"" he said. ""Shaq's sin, the disease he harbors and the lack of desire to want to master it is a huge, huge flaw. They would have won another seven to 10 games if we had maintained our level.""**

**With one phone call, Palubinskas would return to L.A. on a moment's notice. But the Lakers haven't called. That's a sore point, too. After the Lakers won the championship in 2001, Palubinskas got a ring but nothing else.**

**""I've never had a call from him. I didn't get a 'thank you,' I didn't get a hug,"" he said. ""I didn't even get a photo with Shaq. Nothing.""**

**While the Lakers get beaten by 10 points a game in this series, O'Neal is giving away a half-dozen points a night.**

**""That's what they're going to have to live with,"" Palubinskas said. ""Now (opponents) are smelling the blood, and oh my God, it probably will end right here anyway'. It's just a simple shot, and you're going to lose the millions and millions and millions of dollars at stake because someone can't shoot a free throw.""**

"politics","t5_2cneq","This is going to by my last post here, although I find these little discussions entertaining I have work that needs to be done. 
&gt;What reality do you live in? The sheltered white male American kind? None of what you're saying is anywhere close to the reality of living under deprivation and the very real threat of deprivation. You are literally claiming that the very essence of those incarcerated by the state is malign and bankrupt forever. Do you know what a Just World fallacy is? Because you're stuck in a major one.&lt;

So what everyone who is imprisoned is really innocent, it's just the evil state that locks them up? I'm sure there are some that are locked away as a result of unfair laws, or simply by accident, but do you really think people like Ted Bundy, or Jeffery Dahmer are rational individuals? Do you really think that these people are capable of being treated medically? 

&gt;Why are you even continuing on about this? If you can't realize that anarchism and anarchists do not profess to know all the answers for international intervention and support for international developmentalism to take place, I don't know why we're having this conversation. Anarchism is about consensus, so I don't know why you expect me to give dictations on how to solve absolutely everything.&lt;

So let me get this straight, you don't have any answers, but you really know that everyone Else's answers are wrong? Consensus, that's the solution? what is required for consensus 51%, 75%, 100% of people to agree? What happens when there isn't consensus, how is that dealt with? Consensus doesn't even mean that there is any greater likelihood of good decisions being made. There was a relative consensus to invade Iraq in 2003 with something like 70% of people thing it was the right thing to do. I bet you if you went around and started asking people on the street wether or not we should abolish all forms of government, 98% of them would tell you no. Doesn't that mean that there is a consensus that we should have a government?

&gt;Give them mental healthcare. &lt;

Assuming it's even possible to treat people anti-social disorders(it really isn't), how do you acquire the resources for their treatment? They may need doctors, psychologists, medication. The only way would be to acquire resources from others via something like a tax, but this requires currency and a government to facilitate. What if they don't want treatment, what if they refuse treatment? 

&gt;Again, you presume all these people are by their essence malign. Why all the judgment against people you've never known and never met? This is why I call you a racist imperialist: because you have an opinion that has been decided by 3rd-hand conjecture and not the 1st-hand accounts of these people you judge. You've taken on a really negative opinion of others entirely through a bad game of bigoted telephone from other people who've never met the people they malign to you. You would prove to yourself your error if you did even a cursory search on what you're claiming, so why do you keep arguing on and on about things you never bothered to confirm?&lt;

I'm sorry but I don't really have the time nor resources to have a thoughtful discussion with everyone on the planet. Even if I do have a discussion with these people, who is to say the tell the truth, people lie pretty frequently. Realistically pretty much everything both you and I know is through 3rd hand sources, I wasn't around at the battle of Gettysburg to see what really happened. Do you have such a great experience with others that maybe I just don't? Do you have some reason for holding others that you've never met in such high esteem? Can you honestly tell me that everyone on the planet is really just good and honest at heart. One of my good friends was recently jumped beaten on the way home from a party, they didn't even take his wallet or phone, but they made sure to smash his face against the pavement breaking 3 of his front teeth. I'm sure he was a nice and honest caring individual at heart really.

"whatsbotheringyou","t5_2xvyd","I can relate to this fully OP. I was a virgin until I was 19, summer before I went back to college. I botched a few potential opportunities before then because I was so shy and unsure of myself. I wanted to have sex so badly but I was afraid I'd be bad at it or jump the gun or not be able to get hard due to nerves and blow the whole thing.

Then I got a girlfriend and we dated for about a month before I sealed the deal. It was a pretty natural progression - from making out, to going under the shirt, to eventually oral. The time helped - a lot. I dont think I would have been comfortable with jumping into it in a one night stand. But I trusted her and we had a relationship that went beyond sex so it made me a lot less scared about being judged solely on my one performance.

About a week before we actually had sex, I told her I was a virgin. And she didnt laugh or anything, even though she was a lot more experienced than me. She kinda liked it actually, she thought it was sweet and she wanted to give me an awesome first time and liked the fact that she could be the one to do it. And when we did do it, it was great - I probably wasnt amazing but I definitely wasnt bad and she told me she never would have known I was a virgin if I hadnt said anything. Sex is a very instinctual thing really - if you just stop thinking about it so hard your body kinda knows what to do. After that, we had sex all the time and she really got a kick out of introducing me to new things.

So my biggest advice to you is make sure you are comfortable with the person. You dont have to dive into sex, just make out and fool around a few times - and ultimately, be honest. It sounds like that girl likes you so just give it a shot with her and see where it goes, no need to force anything too soon. Just dont think you need to get wasted (probably a terrible idea honestly, drunken impotency is a real thing and it will only make you feel worse) or pick up some random chick at a bar - let it come naturally with someone you have some sort of relationship, be it dating or just a fling.

Besides, if you are like me you have probably seen more than your fair share of porn and have a general idea of how things work. Missionary aint that hard, you will do fine.

Presence of this gene leads to expression of a transcription factor that activates other genes normally only activated for male sex determination.

Gene knockout studies in male mice have shown that if you disable this gene, the mouse will develop to be anatomically female, despite being genetically male.  Humans, without this gene, by default develop into females.

"AirForce","t5_2roa2","When I was in, to test for Staff you had to be a SrA by 1 Feb.  Anything later and you were SOL.

AFI 36-2502 Table 2.1 ""Minimum Eligibility Requirements For Promotion""

&gt; and time in 
current 
grade is 
computed on 
the first day 
of the month 
before the 
month 
promotions 
are made

&gt; 6 months

&gt; and the 
TAFMD is 
on the first 
day of the 
last month 
of the 
promotion 
cycle 
(see note 3)

&gt; 3 Years then

&gt; the Airman is 
eligible for 
promotion if 
recommended, in 
writing, by the 
promotion 
authority. He or 
she must serve on 
AD in enlisted 
status as of the 
PECD, serving 
continuous AD 
until the effective 
date of promotion, 
and is not in a 
condition listed 
under Table 1.1 on 
or after the PECD. 
The individual 
must be in PES 
code X on effective date of promotion 

So, since E5 promotions start on 1 Sep, you have to be promoted 6 months prior to 1 Aug to be eligible.  This happens to be 1 Feb.  Anything after 1 Feb and you will have to wait until the next cycle.

PECD is the cuttoff date for EPRs, decorations, TIG, and TIS points.

The second part just means you have to have 3 years TIS by the last month of the promotion cycle.  This will be the Aug when ""All Others"" are promoted.  Basically a whole year after results are released.  So, Aug 2013 was the last month of the promotion cycle for 12E5.

A couple years after WWII, he went broke and when the citizens of Nanjing heard, the city got together and sent him $2000 US and the mayor went to Germany and bought him and his family a bunch of food as well.

"istp","t5_2r39c","I'm young, but I'll pitch in anyway.

&gt;Do you have many friends? How do you maintain them? What makes you consider someone a friend?

I have plenty of friends, but the ones that I think actually count are the ones that I can be around for a while and not annoy me half to death. I mostly only will take their ways into account when we're alone together because people always act differently around other people. For example, one of my closest friends is great, and I'd trust her with anything, but for the life of me, I feel like stabbing holes into my eardrums whenever I hear her say anything around almost any of her other friends.

&gt;How do you trust and with what?

I'm not a very trusting person, and only have a few friends that I really think I can talk to (3 or 4). I've never really thought about what I'd trust them with, but I tell different things to different ones of them. Some I know are really trustworthy in *this* field, but in the others, not so much.

&gt;How long does it take for you to trust? Extensive or intensive interactions preferred?

It's not really about how long I've been friends with someone, it's more about how well I know them, how well they know me, and how trustworthy I judge them to be. If I don't think they're deserving of this knowledge, I won't give it to them. If I've only known you for a few months, I still might tell you something I haven't mentioned to my friend of four years.

&gt;information about yourself? with material things? Giving contact numbers or emails? Giving someone a ride home? Showing someone where you live? Eating their cooking?

I'm really too young to relate to most of this, but I'm fine giving numbers and emails to most people. I tend not to tell people personal stuff about myself that much, but those that know anything at all probably also know a lot.

&gt;How often do you hang out with someone? How do you meet with someone, when you don't live nearby like in doors or a few blocks away?

I tend not to hang out with people IRL too much, but I play video games in a group with a few of my friends a lot, and will probably spend a lot of time on Skype with them while playing games for long, long periods of time. When I'm with people IRL, I either have a great time or

&gt;How often are you willing to put alone time or recharge time aside to spend time with someone platonically?

In all honesty, unless I'm having a crummy day, I'd be perfectly happy to spend lots of time with a friend (note the singularity of the word ""*friend*"").

&gt;Would you find it odd if someone asked if you had friends?

Probably not, I've been called a loner by people who don't know me too well because, well, I love being alone.

If, after the deadline, there is any property which was not claimed by the tenants or any other people notified, depending on the circumstances, the landlord must do one of two things with the remaining property:16
a. If the landlord reasonably believes that the property is worth less than $300, he or she may keep it, give it away, sell it or destroy it.

b. If the property is reasonably believed to be worth $300 or more, the landlord should arrange to have it sold at a public bidding sale after giving notice of the sale through publication. Both the landlord and the tenant have a right to bid on the property at the sale. After the property is sold, the landlord may deduct the costs of storage, advertising the sale, and conducting the sale. The remaining money must then be paid over to the county.

1. The Thirty Years War (a massive internationalized civil war that led to the death of about 30% of Central Europe) and the English Civil War (which he fled in order to write *Leviathan*); and,

2. Hobbes' reading of Thucydides, specifically the descriptions of Hellenic tribal warfare in the ""Archaeology"" section, and the Corcyraean Civil War in Book III.

Hobbes' state of nature image is drawn from civil war, which makes sense since the Leviathan sovereign's purpose was to prevent sedition and rebellion.

Honestly, it was my first time playing it despite having it for a while. I knew there were some funky location issues (Dark. Underground, etc...) and that there were tons of dwarves. I've been playing with a few of the heroes, allies, and events already, but got to use them in their appropriate context.

For this I was using a Leadership/Spirit deck with Eowyn, Dwalin, and Aragorn. This has been a great questing deck for me, being able to fly through locations and occasionally having to slow down to actually fight something. Though my threat level started a bit high, I figured I could probably just fly through here. But alas, it was not the case.

***Into the Pit*** is the first scenario, which is actually a really cool one that requires you to pass through the East Gate into the First Hall and finally to the Bridge of Khazad-Dum before you even make it to 2B. All was going swimmingly. I was exhausting Eowyn and Aragorn to fly through 1B and then made it to 2B. I'm supposed to get the Goblin Patrol leader out? Ok! He's not that bad. 4 attack, 3 defense and 4 to kill, but his text is something different, ""**Forced**: *Before Patrol Leader is dealt damage, discard the top card of the encounter deck. If the discarded card is an enemy, cancel that damage."" That's a bit gross. It was going to take me two rounds to attack him with the allies I had in play. Low and behold, not one, but 4 enemies showed up in a row. That weighed me down so much, by the time I killed him I was so far down it was hardly worth it to go on. I did and quickly perished in the mines of Moria.

Take two. I actually kept the same Leadership/Spirit deck, but knew what was coming so I had plenty of allies and events in play to help me jump on it. I also had Gandalf in my hand ready to go. It worked. I was able to tackle the Goblin Patrol Leader and move on to 3B. That's nice because the last phase of the quest heroes cannot collect resources. I power-quested through this one, exhausting every single character I had to achieve maximum spirit points. Whew...

I had heard mixed opinions about ***The Seventh Level***, that it shouldn't be a difficulty level of 3, but rather a bit higher. There are only two questing cards, but both have loads of progress points to get through them. Well, I just took my mighty questing deck through and ended up with a higher threat level (42) than I wanted, but was able to make it with one go. I can see that this is entirely dependent on what cards are drawn. You draw two or three baddies in a row and you are out of luck.

I took one trip back to [**A Journey to Rhosgobel**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98113/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-a-journey-to) since I had only played it a couple of times. I actually like this quest a lot. You are assisting an injured eagle and must take him to Rhosgobel (the home of Radagast the Brown). The tricky thing with this deck is that you can't merely plow through the questing phase because if you don't have enough Athelas to heal the eagle by the end of the quest, you lose. So this goes against what my Leadership/Spirit deck does. Sure I'm able to plow through quests no problem, but if I can't draw the necessary Athelas, I'm down and out. Only played this one once and just got smashed. Lost Eowyn and Aragorn through *when revealed* cards while questing.

I've rebuilt my deck using Leadership/Lore for another round. Haven't tested it yet. So we'll see...

""I want to start hunting but have no idea how to skin/butcher an animal, and I don't really have a desire to either. Is it feasible to go hunting for, say, deer, hogs, or elk and than bring the kill to a butcher to cut up some steaks and what not.

About how much money would I be looking at to butcher an elk or a deer?""

And today you're giving advice on game handling? I believe you were giving some conflicting advice and decided to barf it all here in a jack-assy manner. Steps taken after the kill all depend on temperature. Also, do you have to quarter it, or do you have the option of field dressing and bringing the entire animal intact back with you?  First, as soon as you can, field dress the animal. Most will leave the hide on for protection from flies, dirt, etc, depending on the temperature. If the temperature is good (below 50, but not freezing at night), you can leave it hanging from a solid tree limb. Cheese cloth bags are a good idea to protect the parts that are exposed, so you got that right. Field dress, do not butcher as soon as possible, you want to wait until rigor mortis has completed if possible, up to 24 hours after death. Aging the meat will produce better quality meat as the collagen is broken down naturally, and aging is best done at between 33 and 40 f, and if you can do this for a week of more, you will end up with more tender meat. This is the same as beef, all beef is aged, either wet aged or dry aged. Wet aged is crap you get for 1.99/lb at a grocery store, dry aged is the stuff you pay real money for, as it's been hung and cooled in a room for 28 days. It builds up a crust on it, which you break off. It's tender and delicious and well worth the wait. Venison is the same, but I learned a week minimum to two weeks maximum to hang it for the best quality of meat (again, in 34-40F temps), depending on the age of the animal harvested (older = more collagen, longer to break down. I may be wrong here, a real butcher would be able to direct you better than I here edit: Especially about the times to leave hanging, I'd like to know from someone more knowledgeable than me about that - I love venison, but if there's a way to make it even better, I'm all ears).","1380585736"

In which case, trying to target the male gender as a whole, is a pretty useless and imprecise way of resolving these kinds of problems.

Not necessarily. The people who are actually responsible for this behavior will test to see what they can get away with; if they're surrounded by peers who make it clear that they do not condone a behavior, they may be less likely to do it - either because they use their peers as a moral compass, or because they know they won't get away with it.

So it's not necessarily useless and imprecise to target the entire gender - it might be easier to make all the good guys aware of the problem, instead of trying to identify (and somehow influence) just the bad guys.","1380585737"

But this is an e-mail to his boss at the university, someone who could easily audit the diversity training session to find out if his employee is lying or not, which to me lends credence to his complaints. Clearly he was expected to sit down, shut up, and get called a racist and just take it. To even *question* the this treatment has people here calling him a racist. That is very real persecution, and having a reputation as a racist, undeserved based on this letter alone, can cost you your job, your friends, basically you are one step above a pedophile in American culture, especially at a liberal university. I disagree with his characterization of transgendered people as perverts, but his squeamishness is understandable considering he is probably an uptight academic who just wants to teach Japanese history, and not get caught up in gender and race politics, or be called a racist because he is white.

Yes they may have alot of work now which might require full time, if anything they shouldn't get paid near as much as they do for what their doing in my opinion. They should be doing it truly because they want to serve the country, maybe they'd take it a bit more seriously.

Maybe its just me..

The cashier was rude to everyone and didn't know a damn thing about anything in the store. They also charge $30 for the draft where the other LGS I played at the night before was $15.

What's interesting is that the sticker correctly corresponds to the brand and/or barcode that the product needs. This is because fruits and vegetables are strict deists, and don't believe in free will - each is destined to fill a particular role in life that does not change. But how does the fruit or vegetable know what that role is?

A breakout paper on the topic that was recently published suggests that vegetables and fruits regularly communicate with god, and as a result are aware of their purposes long before they're picked. The scientists involved then went a step further, isolating a few fairly pious rutabaga to communicate their questions to god. An excerpt is reproduced below (the researcher is identified as R, and the rutabaga is also identified as R) :


&gt;  R: Hello. How are you feeling today?

2. It changes from place to place; it's really a function of the school and departmental leadership.

3. Math or Reading, depending on what you're good at. I've met kids that read at a 4th grade level but are doing 9th grade math. They love math class because it's the one part of the day when they get to be smart and talented. 

4. Currently in a *very* vocal dispute with admin over lunch detention policy.

5. A kid called me a 'shit-eating dick' last year, now his PM detentions involve repairing bikes (which he loves doing) with integrated physics lessons.

6. Self-esteem, confidence in the legitimacy of one's actions, and empathy.

7. Once, someone brought a dead fish to class in their backpack. By 12:30 (school starts at 7:25) the entire class smelt like low tide at the pier. I was really upset *not* because of the smell, but because I felt a severe amount of empathy for the kid, thinking that he was experiencing some kind of problem with his home life. I was planning on buying him deodorant and soap. Turns out that he just found it on the way to the bus. 

8. Math teachers tend to be the most pessimistic while lacking a sense of humor. Science teachers tend to be just as pessimistic but we cope by having a very rich and dark sense of humor. 

9. When I had a dispute with a teacher as an 11th grader, and won. I learned that there was something that I was good at.

10. Twerking injury.

11. Practice critical thinking skills and persuasive debate. **With Common Core coming, we are all getting deputized as critical thinking and reading teachers. You might as well cut your teeth debating with friends. You can't win an emotionally charged debate with a 13 year old. If you get emotional with them you look like an idiot, 100 percent of the time.**

EDIT: 

12. Although I teach science, I spend a lot of time discussing the art of public speaking ( My mom was a journalist and LA teacher and I run the debate team). I always correct students on little things like good v. well and who v. whom. They *always* say that they don't think that it matters (and it really doesn't when you're 13). I always respond by explaining that words have meaning, and that the more self conscious  you are of the your syntax, the more apt you are to use language as a tool to advance your goals. Whenever people say, ""Talk is cheap,"" I respond with, ""It's not cheap, it's less costly."" One day, and it **will** happen, you will need to use your words to achieve a very important goal (job interview, relationships, whatever). You can either learn those language skills at a 13 year old and make it a reflexive response, or you can wander around in your late 20's not knowing why people say whom instead of whom. The more self conscious you are about your language, the more likely you are to use language properly, and it's more likely that you can solve problems with words instead of violence.

about people bashing it about bugs, obviously people are going to do this but league of legends has 1000s of bugs and its the biggest e sports game ever.

They like compromise. To mangle a West Wing quote;

They want people to compromise with them and come half way to their position. Then they're half-way apart, so people have to compromise again and come halfway again towards their position. Now they're 25% apart and people have to compromise again and come to 12.5% away from their position.

He may not have been a criminal, we'll never know because he's not alive to tell his story. He may have been a victim of a person like you who thinks they have the right to kill someone when they feel ""threatened.""  Being ""threatened"" and killing someone in self-defense is a very fuzzy grey area.  I've been threatened before, and plenty of those situations end in both parties going home alive.

If I tell you I fucked your mother last night, don't put a bullet in me, ok bro?  That might make me an asshole to say that to you, but it doesn't mean I deserve to die.  You are not the authority who gets to decide my fate.  I don't want that decision to be yours.  That's what the justice system is for.  Does it work all the time?  No, but it's more effective than your method which ends up with people you label ""criminals"" as dead, and those people can't rise from the grave to tell everyone their side of the story.

&gt; Maximizing loss of life is not my priority

I've been running 3miles every other day (off days) consistantly for the past 4 months or so.  I can run 3 miles nonstop which takes me about 28-30m.  It took me, about 3 weeks to get to that point, but I had been doing HIT days each friday for a month or so before I started running.

Stop worrying about running for a set amount of time and focus on finish a certain amount of distance, how ever you can.  That helped motivate me to push myself to run for longer and longer before giving up because I wasn't there to run 30m, I was there to run 3 miles.  I hate running, so the sooner it's over the better.

You'll feel your lungs and heart get tired the most, at least for me.  Eventually, after months of doing my 3 miles every other day, I decided to force myself to not stop unless I thought I absolutely had too.  It's hard and it sucks, but I was able to do it.  Since then it's only gotten easier and I'm finally getting bored on the treadmill.

They were probably pissed at the driver because he didn't give way to them or something - you know, since their swarm owns the entire road - so this rider throws his brain into overdrive and decides that brake checking a 4500 lb Range Rover on his bike is the best way to express his disapproval.

There was no doubt that something happened prior to the video that got the riders off side with the driver, but their reaction was absolutely unacceptable. You don't beat people up for doing the wrong thing on the road.

Take his plate #, call the cops, let them deal with him - they have all the evidence they need on one of the 30 fucking go-pro's that were probably recording it.

Its job is to help prevent the stresses of dropping the clutch, but at low speeds (1st into 2nd) it tends to make it difficult to discern the engagement of the clutch.  Thus, you end up with bucking.  I had an E46 325xi for 8 years and even after all that time it was difficult to get a smooth 1-2 shift.

"redditdota2league","t5_2w8vi","&gt;You're making a bit of a tautological argument: of course, if you have things in your life that make setting aside time to play video games hard to do, it will be hard to do. This doesn't account for the fact of how difficult it is to schedule games with 10 people without just having it be a hard and fast rule. What about people that can't play at the 2pm Sunday make-up time, ever? Then this is much better. Ultimately, I believe this decision will make the league run MUCH more smoothly.

However much I agree with what you are saying, I still do not see the reason for there not being 1 division per timezone that is less strict in the days you play, the participants knowing full well what the complications are. My team played the entire tournament with 1 guy doing shift work. Did this work out? yes. We had to try harder for scheduling, but we accepted that. I would like a division where this is possible and all participants accept this, not hurting the other divisions at all.

&gt;This assumption that 2 players just won't play because they're not as skilled, so the team will lose them then have to forfeit games, assumes that captains are idiots. As a captain, of course I'm going to try and keep my players happy. I'm going to play them, pure and simple. You have to realize that the probability of winning by playing better players is far offset by the likelihood of forfeit when your players leave.

Most players, and especially captains, in this league want to be competitive to a certain degree. Maybe you would field your 6th or 7th, knowing there is a big chance they will cost you the match, but a lot of captains will not, no matter what they say. It just gnaws inside of you every time you know you could have a win instead of that loss.  I do not think that captains will think about their fillers unless they are forced to, either by rules or by main players dropping out. I am not sure this is going to happen, but I feel there is a big chance it is.

&gt;So, there should be exactly 0 drop-outs due to being forced to play on a single day, since it's a day of your choosing

I can normally play on friday. Does this mean I can play every friday? If you only have 5-6 players left due to dropouts, forfeits will happen and they will happen more often than anyone would like.

divisions has been fully countered by chib.

That contextual, perhaps cynical malleability is what I like about it. Coincidental wordplay emerges, and in relation with the term being discussed. Amusing enough.

It can be said wryly by someone in a dictatorship, or said quite innoculously elsewhere in casual conversation not beholden to upvotes. Perhaps I should have used 'freedom' with quotation marks in the second sentence, but I thought it would have implied some disrespect to the source of the quote. Then there's the fact that my fellow redditors can get upset for various reasons, you see. Not something I want to bother with. Therefore I chose to ignore the technical shortcomings and point out the less obvious but fairly interesting aspect I noticed.

Perhaps you also seem to think that I am professing that the quote has reached some conclusive objective truth about freedom that is sorely ignored by fellow voters and that by endorsing it as such I must make crudely disparaging remarks about fervently-minded people who attend rallies in the interest of the public good, or whatever your remaining comments would have entailed.","1380585766"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Yeah, the private market is doing wonders in health care and telecommunications. And banking! And, you know, education... there are so many private schools offering better outcomes at cheaper prices than public schooling.

So let me address schooling and education here, as many of their problems spring from government regulation:

**Healthcare**: I'm going to quote myself from another post from a while ago.

A large part of the problem is the way insurance companies are regulated in the US. Restrictions on interstate commerce make it extremely difficult for insurers to compete. Here's what happens.

Existing companies are not allowed to dispense insurance across state lines. For example, a NY company cannot sell its policies to a NJ resident. So let's say that NY company wants to expand into the NJ market, what do they have to do? Well, they have to open a business in New Jersey, and starting up what is essentially a new company in another state costs a lot of money. You have to learn and conform to all the new state laws, you have to gather all new sets of demographics data, learn your market, etc.

Then you have your competitors. Obviously they're not willing to give up any more of their market share than they have to. They're already well established, and probably have the ins-and-outs of their state's market down to a science. So they'll do what any other smart business would do, undercut you. They'll drop their prices past the lowest point that you could still be in the black. They can do this because they're already established, and even if they take some losses to drive you out of business, it'd cost them a lot more in the long run to let you compete against them.

These two problems are probably the biggest reasons why our healthcare system is the way it is. If we made the market more competitive, and implemented tort reform so doctors don't have to worry about getting sued into oblivion every time they miss an exceptionally unusual condition, you can bet those prices would drop like rocks. There are some states with two health care providers for the entire state. Two.

**Education**: First, I'm not sure why you've lumped the idea that private schools are both less effective and more expensive than public schools. I'm pretty sure all data points to the fact that private schooling generally provides a much higher quality of education and positive results in its students

Yes, you're right, private schools *do* cost a lot of money relative to public education, but this is because they have no serious competition, because the government has a monopoly on schooling. If you eliminated public schools, there would still be a demand for schooling, but this time there would be competition in the market place. Companies would be vying to offer the best education at the lowest prices, because that's how the market works. Instead what you have now are public schools where the richest neighborhoods have the absolute best schooling and the poorest have the absolute worst. There's no incentive for public schools to improve their teaching standards (in a way that's truly comprehensive anyway), because they know that they're still going to get government funding year after year.","1380585768"

But for anyone who is leaning one way or the other, this chance to get a free pack from four games would tip the scale. And when they win an expensive player from a tourney pack, I guarantee they won't go spend cash. A business would never give the opportunity for a customer base like that to just leave.

Also, I think you're grossly underestimating the amount of tournament wins there are per day. In 13 I usually won the gold cup 1-2 times a day, out of around 12 games on average. That's just me, but there are plenty of players much better who could win it more. Not to mention that if this pack existed, so many more people would keep playing it.

"malehairadvice","t5_2s1me","As a hairdresser here's what I suggest: 
Go to an upper scale salon and ask for someone who specializes in texturized men's haircuts. Bring pictures on your phone or whatever of cuts you like. But because your face shape is somewhat round doing that side part with the longish bang is a. Making your face appear more round and b. makes the cut look more feminine. if you get a cut more like this:

Or this if the side bang thing makes you more comfortable, you could totally do this: 

http://menhairstylestre.com/latest-hairstyles-for-men-2013/men-asian-korean-hairstyles-2013/

The idea is if you get a cut that's shorter on the sides, with a good amount of length on top it'll elongate your face and make it appear more oval. Regardless of what you do, you inevitably have to use some product because nobody's hair looks texturized or lays perfect without it, especially if your hair is really straight, but the hairdresser can suggest something to you. Sorry this is 9 years long, just trying to help you out. ","1380585783"

"happyhardcore","t5_2rgie","I'm going to preface this by saying I live in Los Angeles, so while I might have a decent idea about what goes on in LA and the surrounding cities, my knowledge might be lacking when it comes to places outside of that.  
  
So, assuming you've no idea about events and don't have any contacts built up to rely on, the first thing you're going to want to do is start checking forums. Most HH and HS events are going to be small (200-500) people max or will only take 1 stage of a larger event. You probably won't hear about them via word of mouth or anything so you need to target your search. Happyhardcore.com and plurlife.com both have forums and both post about events (HHC is almost all hardcore, plurlife is mixed). Check the upcoming events, something might turn up in your area (1-2 time per month is all you need).  
  
Assuming you've looked and haven't found anything (possible, depending on where you live and what time of the year it is) you then need to go back to the forums and look at the past events. If you find anything, get the names of every HHC DJ you can, every promoter for the event, or anyone involved with the event. Add them on as many social media platforms as you can. The smaller events will primarily be advertised through facebook in small social circles. Promoters and DJ's will all advertise for each other and that really the best way to hear about future events. Once you have a nice list of people who are ""in the business"", you just wait for the next event to pop up. For example, I follow most of the HHC DJ's and promoters in the area, so when anything happens, I normally get a few notifications. A side note, photographers are also an amazing way of keeping up to date. Look for event photographers and follow  them/check their website.  
  
Finding an event is the hardest. Once you're there, it gets easier. Talking to people is the best way to find follow up leads (as well as a great way of making friends/having fun). If the person looks live they've been raving for a bit (ie, kandi everywhere, crazy dyed hair, etc), strike up a conversation. How long they've been raving, who their favorite DJ's are, how to get an invite to the next event etc. People are normally very friendly and willing to help. Finally, don't throw away the promo cards you get after the rave. You will normally find similar families of music being advertised (hardstyle and a HHC event or vica versa). This is how you add to your resource list. Stalk the DJ's and promoters on social media and keep growing the collection.  
  
I would also assume you're following your favorite international DJ's as well, because they do sometimes make it to the states. Specifically DJ Ravine and DJ Cotts were in Miami and I think S3RL was out that way too. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQEYeUcle6g) I'm pretty sure everyone is doing this but I figured there might be a few who arnt.  
  
And my one last hidden tip for finding events would be to check out anime conventions. It sound strange but actually ends up working out. Anime Expo is supposed to have a pretty legit 2-3 day event, with real HHC DJ's and they even fly in international guests from Japan. A lot of the stuff will border on J-core but there is a good deal of super cheesy hardcore to be found as well. Keep an open mind and check it out and you might find something, plus I know some of the conventions are more popular than raves in some places.

So, thats my guide. It's not perfect but it will start you out. Please keep in mind that I live in Los Angeles, 15 minutes away from most of the events I end up going to, and that LA has FAR more events so don't feel bad if you have to wait 3-6 months to hear anything. If you're really desperate you can always email events and request genres to be played or try and pimp your favorite DJ and get them to book him/her. If all else fails, wait for one of the headliners to play in the US and make a trip to see them.  
  
I did not talk about trance simply because of how popular it is. Finding a club/rave that plays trance shouldn't be too hard as there are more people that listen and more people that spin it. If it is an issue call the club and tell them you think a trance night would be great for business and see where you get.

TL;DR  
Check forums  
Add people on facebook

The logic behind it is that if you can be put into a compromising situation, your responsibilities and trustworthiness are at risk. You are more prone to blackmail or to participate in illegal activities, etc. to cover your tracks.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;&gt; Or they actually have no confidence in their work, perhaps imposter syndrome

&gt; I have yet to meet such a programmer.

Hi. I learned about computers and coding as a young teenager, then did a degree in it (which I made a complete mess of), then programmed for a living for seven years. And objectively, I was pretty successful, or at least people praised me - but I never felt as though I was any good, and eventually my lack of confidence / impostor syndrome led directly to burnout and career meltdown - three months off with stress, then resignation, and I haven't been able to hold down a job since. Programming remains my obsession, but I can't actually make myself *do* it any more. (Also, I'd like to get started with electronics, but I have sod all confidence there too.)

So whether I am actually a bad programmer or just mentally ill, I'll let you decide. (Diagnosed, but possibly misdiagnosed - certainly drug-resistant - depression and undiagnosed autism didn't help. I finally got that diagnosis, 15 years after it could have been useful... and sadly five years after I exhausted my capacity to engage with people in any meaningful way. I'm pretty much a recluse now; I go out of my way to avoid having to communicate with people in real life, and can't even bear to post online with an identity that's anything more than transient, because the emotional stress of the inevitable arguments knocks me back for days. So I guess you won't actually *meet* me... but you know, hi anyway. And perhaps that's why you've never met a programmer like me, and probably never will, even though I know damned well that we exist.)

Also: any time someone claims that something doesn't happen because they've never seen it, I want to bash them over the head with a squirrel. And then claim that nobody ever gets bashed over the head with squirrels, because it's never happened to me. (Not a live squirrel, obviously. That would be cruel.)","1380585794"

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","The behavior is probably self-reinforcing and also heavily a matter of impulse control - so working on it when it happens is going to obviously be difficult.

Try working on it before it happens: Teach how to meet a stranger step by step while staying focused on you or the task at hand. You literally just do any exercise you like and let the stranger or the dog take a step closer every time you're solid at a new distance. It can be convenient because for some dogs the distance-closing works as a treat (but maybe do this after you've played around with different conditioned and unconditioned reinforcers a bit)

Also yes, forceful coercive methods can make things worse. To be honest, they often work very well in the short term, but they're about as ethical as kiddy diddling and do cause long term damage a lot of the time. So just don't.

Read a lot about progressive reinforcement training and the references on the side of this subreddit. If a clicker and an easywalk harness aren't available to you, don't sweat - anything that makes a consistent noise, including your mouth, can be the conditioned reinforcer. And a good front-clip harness makes restraint a bit easier, more controlled and less potentially injurious, but isn't an absolute necessity.

Also, to answer the question about exercise: Training and having a dog use it's head does tend to mellow them out a lot. You can and should turn almost every interaction into at least a little bit of training - it quickly adds up over time, improves their focus a lot and you don't need to try ""long"" training sessions that just frustrate you and the dog and make you both dread doing it more.

Edit:
You can literally watch any and all clicker-based training videos and use the exact same method, including the initial ""charging"" (conditioning) of the clicker. It's a matter of convenience to have an actual clicker, but just saying ""Good""/""Yes""/""whatever"" or a quick single syllable of your choice works too - just be very consistent with the word you choose and fast.

For treats you cut stuff without onions/garlic in it up into tiny bits, but I guess that is obvious. You can also use the main meals for this - gives you a great excuse to make the training session short, easy and really rewarding.","1380585795"

"socialjustice101","t5_2vjn1","I'm not sure what you're responding to, tbh. Did I say that feminism was all about dealing with the MRA, or that the MRA had wide institutional power? I believe what I said was that this particular article does a good job of rebutting an MRA talking point that I've seen parroted. 

However, I do not agree that the MRA is simply a sad, powerless band of misfits. I think any woman that has been harassed by them, or, like me, has been dedicated to a subculture that the MRA has been making inroads into can tell you that they might be small but their power depends on an uninformed, and/or grossly privileged, patriarchy that is pushing back hard against feminism. They might not have institutional power, but they do possess rhetorical power and I think we feminists ignore that at our peril (and most especially at the peril of our sisters and brothers,  who's lives these shitheels zealously destroy.)","1380585799"

"hardware","t5_2qh18","I'm a bit of an AMD fanboy, and here are my two cents. While AMD is no doubt behind with their FX to the Core-I line up, even more so as comparing Thuban to Nehalem where the it was at least a more balanced generation.

The FX line up, from what I read as a explanation of it, was that the Thuban/Deneb line up was extremely cost inefficient to make. Where the actual cost to make it was outweighting heavily the amount you could sell it. The FX line up was originally launched not to increase performance, but to decrease production costs. 

I'm paraphrasing that information, but the point is that performance and heat isn't the only thing to go into chip design. Supposedly the FX line up was actual a huge success in reducing cost to produce. Again, that comes from one source I have lost long ago, and as a fanboy I am very inclined to believe this.

2. His agenda was to trivialize the mission. If he was simply just bringing up those arguments to allow a fair chance to respond he would counter the argument by saying something like ""If you can find a movie theater for $7 I want to go there."" Which was being extremely dismissive to the point that the NASA engineer made saying the cost is really minimal to the american people.

When people do bring up arguments just to allow the person to respond they don't inject their personal feelings to reinforce the argument or to disagree with their response to it.

An unbiased interview would simply state something like ""A lot of people seem to be frustrated with the cost of this program, it did cost 2.1 billion dollars and there aren't any immediate practical gains from this project, what do you think about the accusations that these programs are expensive and wasteful?""

I try to help my tammates to play good, and I always try not to discuss. I have played my 3 placement matches as Varus, my favorite adc, being supported by a friend in my same situation (first 3 placement matches) who mains Thresh. All 3 times we really stomped our lane. I got out of the laning phase with 4-6 kills, and never with more than 3 deaths between me and my support. But thing is, in all 3 matches we ended up losing hard (we never destroyed more than 3 towers, and I'm not the kind of player who prefers kills over objectives), and my score was always close to 8-8, because the enemy team focused me really hard, and my team wasn't able to fight without me. In none of the 3 matches I raged to my team (my friend did), and I always prefer looking at my faults before my team's. I know my positioning is not the best, but besides that, I really think that in all 3 matches I played almost to my best. Question is: Am I just unlucky to get unbalanced teams/my team isn't playing well enough? Is it the fact that I'm in duo? Can you help me please? I'd be really sad to end up in bronze, I really think we're not that bad. Thanks and sorry for my bad english!

"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","The average wf fly line has most of its mass at the first 30-40ft. This allows for distance overhead casting, but it wont do well for distance roll casting or mending. When throwing around indicators and splitshot, you don't want to be overhead casting as a beginner. As you get better at casting you'll be able to still get distance while having an open loop but for now its going to cause a LOT of frustration. 

The rio line for example has a 50-60ft belly where most of the mass is. It is not as good at distance overhead casting as a wf, but you will be able to roll cast and mend significantly further than another line. A DT line works in the same way but won't overhead cast past 60ft which isn't something a beginner should do anyways, but the other lines will have more use for you later.

As far as tactics go, eggs and bobbers work, no doubt about it. Streamers also work but beginners often get confused with sink tips yada yada. Ease into that after a couple of trips. Steelhead on the great lakes don't take streamers as readily as west coast steelies either.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The British opium trade in China was a direct result of the Qing Dynasty's self-defeatingly arrogant trade policies that prohibited exporting goods for anything but silver. Further, their concern over opium was not one of concern for addicts, but indignance that ""barbarians"" would dare flaunt their laws and remove some small measure of their absolute authority over their subjects, who the ruling class saw as nothing but livestock to be used or disposed of at their leisure.

Here's a nice picture of what the Qing Dynasty was like: [the Taiping Rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion), a civil war that left 20+ million dead, mostly civilians, and primarily at the hands of Imperial forces, who frequently slaughtered any and all civilians they came across, both in enemy territory *and their own*. Not that the Taiping regime was any nicer; by all accounts they were psychotic even by the standards of 19th century China.

If you want someone impressive for that area and time period, [the leaders of the Ever Victorious Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_Victorious_Army), the small mercenary force formed to fight the Taipings and which was ultimately instrumental in defeating them, make pretty good candidates.

So even though there's times where you might just wanna skip a couple eps or just stop watching, just stick with it.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","You're not going to find a truly unbiased discussion anywhere, but I'll try to present the facts as I see them. Fair warning, I am a vegetarian:

Now, to start the argument, I am conscious. I know this with absolute certainty. I believe other people are also conscious, as do most people. Why? Because they're extremely similar to me. It's certainly not definitive proof, but there *can't* be definitive proof of the existence of other consciousnesses. Animals, and mammals especially, while structurally quite different, also exhibit many behaviors that are similar to mine: they make decisions, they store information for future use, they learn, and many of them engage in social interaction and do things that are, from outside observation, similar to human emotion. Now, we don't know that those things mean consciousness, but we also don't know that the behaviors our fellow humans exhibit mean consciousness either. To me, the difference between human and animal behavior seems to largely one of degree: all animals that I give any moral importance to are capable of at least rudimentary learning, even if they're significantly worse at it than humans. Additionally, the mechanism through which they do so, neurons, is the same. Non-animal organisms and nonlife, on the other hand, if they learn at all, employ a fundamentally different mechanism that, as far as we know, doesn't produce behavior remotely as similar to that of humans as animal neurons do. So, in short, I believe that animals are similar enough to us that the odds of their being conscious are of a comparable order of magnitude to the odds of other humans being conscious. Since we give other humans moral value despite not being certain they're conscious, we have to do the same for animals we suspect might be conscious. That means not eating them, unless you're also willing to accept cannibalism. ","1380585813"

"truetf2","t5_2stfn","I dislike the 4-man suicide because it takes a lot of time and pushing uber v uber with a height disadvantage is already a pain in the ass. Once you do your 4 man and it fails, they can just push up to forward hold and pop you in an extremely unlucky position. Also it's the go-to strategy of many teams so it's kinda expected, and most teams will put forth the precautions to take down your jumpers way ahead of time. 

Slow pushes without uber are risky but if you manage to pick off a roamer or scout while taking that position, it can work. Especially if your scouts live throughout the whole thing, as they tend to be the deciding factor in the success of the slow push. because if you force their combo, most peoples reaction would be to go after your medic. The heat should be off the scouts, theoretically

With uber, it's a lot easier to pull off, of course

If it's no ubers on either side, by all means just slow push and dm it out. 

In all situations the demo should lead it with heals. If he does good damage the pocket can jump in and capitalize. 

edit: also I love using forward holds on this map, I recommend trying it. Pocket plays under bridge next to the house, demo/roamer on cliff, one scout on cliff the other on the ground near your pocket. Shuts down 2 doors and if they come to the other one, you can back up to the rock and fight them from there

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","I don't see an reason to wait on filling the tank, but I'd let the dust from the substrate settle before adding the plants., so that the none of the dust settles on the plants.  The sand is not harmful, but dusting the plants is an annoyance that can easily be avoided.

You say you are using a plant substrate, if you mean something like eco-complete, then you should avoid dosing ferts for a few months.  That kind of substrate already has ferts in it, so you could end up with algae blooms if you immediately start dosing on top of that.  It's fine to dose Excel, just no nutrient-based ferts in the beginning.

Plants are a matter of personal preference. My favorite plants in my tanks are my pennywort and wisteria. I also have hygrophila, watersprite, myrio, rotala, ludwigia, and an anubias.

Other random bit of advice, when you are buying plants look VERY closely at the tank you are getting your plants from, check for algae on ANY plants in the tank.  I slipped up on that rule one day and accidentally introduced black beard algae to my tank.  In case you are unfamiliar with black beard algae, it is the devil. It spreads quickly, covers everything and is too slick and slimy to be manually removed.  I had to remove and scrub my driftwood with steel wool, throw out half of my plants, and alternate blackouts and reduced light cycles for nearly a month.","1380585818"

What happens actually takes place in your testicles. Back when men lived in the wild, spotting a dangerous predator would cause the testicles to produce hormones whose effect is to ""pump you up"" for trouble. This still happens today to a lesser degree when you see an insect. The hormones produce a chemical reaction in the air which the insect notices and as a result, it freezes or plays dead to avoid danger.

You don't want to repeat the same mistake as the existing designers have done with cards like Mental Misstep that warp a whole format around those specific cards.

Not saying the card you designed is nearly as bad as Mental Misstep but it's very important to keep in mind all formats when designing cards. This is even more important for when you are designing sets or blocks because you want to have the new sets or blocks provide some manner of cards for Modern, Legacy as well as casual crowds like EDH.

All trade in US Dollars; not all trade with the US.

If the US can send them stuff they want there will still be trade, but the US government will lose the ability to print anything other than monopoly money.

US Dollars are only worth anything because you can spend them, and if the US debt bursts you won't be able to do that anymore.

You're on the right track.  As far as taxes, that probably depends on your particular financial situation.  If your employer has a 401k plan with employer matching, then it would be beneficial to put some of your paycheck in there, at least up to the match, and then dump the rest into your Roth IRA.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes, both parties submitted amendments.  However, the case can be made that many of those were made to delay the passage or otherwise tie the legislation up for an indefinite period of time.  The Republicans knew the Democrats controlled the presidency and both hoses of Congress and whatever Democrat legislation they wanted would eventually pass.  Their tactics were the same as the opposition would use if the positions were reversed. 

In the end, I believe ANY legislation that cannot get even a single vote from the minority party is something that should be debated further in order to establish some sort of bipartisan vote. ACA passed with zero minority party votes.

Your grandfather would have had less money in his pocket to begin with; and fewer properties he could have bought.   Either way Uncle Sam gets his cut, but with an inheritance tax, your grandfather got to determine what to do with his money (buying more parcels of land)  and not the government.
The choice is not 'inheritance tax vs nothing'  its 'inheritance tax vs some other tax'.   Its sucks, but it sucks less than the alternative.

"UIUC","t5_2qkxs","I have ADD and have gone through the entire process. Your first step is to call the counseling center (217-333-3704) and inform them that you're interested in being screened for AD/HD. Unfortunately, a lot of students call them asking for appointment at the start of each semester and the slots fill up fast, so they might already be booked through the semester. So, definitely call them ASAP.
You'll then see a psychologist who will talk to you between 1-2 hours, asking you various questions about your mental and physical health history, your academic history, your habits, and any struggles you've been having. If they conclude that you do indeed have a form of AD/HD, then you'll be directed to DRES for further screening. 
In my case, I was already seeing a psychiatrist at McKinley, so he was the one that diagnosed me after my initial screening with the Counseling Center and he got me the letter necessary to be registered with DRES. But either way, working with DRES is a lifesaver when you have ADD, so take advantage of whatever accommodations they potentially give you. Good luck!","1380585847"

"news","t5_2qh3l","I don't think it's that drastically different- personally my worldview is always undergoing adjustments and it changes with time, just as people do.  Now that I have two young kids my instincts are much more finely tuned regarding my surroundings than they were in my early 20's where I didn't give it much thought.  And it's not because I think the world is more dangerous at all or walk around paranoid, but there is just a lot more riding on the unlikely event for the safety of myself or my family who relies on me.  You don't need to be paranoid to consider what you would do in a given extreme situation, or to minimize the chance you will ever find yourself in one.   It's not like you go through every second of every day thinking people are out to get you..you just pay it *some* mind.

Being aware of your surroundings is just good practice.  Any event that takes someones life is going to be an extremely unlikely event that to others I should spend no time thinking about.  But If i can shave off half of the possible events and prepare for the other half I can't control that's a small amount of time to pay to ensure that my kids still have a daddy and that I still have my family.","1380585853"

"gaybros","t5_2tdzg","[Fellow ""gaybro"" Rich Juzwiak wrote an excellent synopsis on the finale](http://gawker.com/why-breaking-bads-finale-was-perfect-1426923789). Which Salon article are you talking about? Is it [this one](http://www.salon.com/2013/09/30/where_does_breaking_bad_fit_on_the_finale_spectrum/) because that was poorly written and off the mark in my opinion. (I love SATC and the BB finale was not similar at all.) Also I think you're laser focused on the concept of plot dynamics (climax / rising action / falling action). There *was* a climax in the finale...(there's usually one in every episode). Actually multiple ~~orgasms~~ climaxes in this finale. (When Walt confronts Gretchen and Elliot and the lasers! and when Walt visits the Nazis at the end). I think the most important achievement in a finale episode is that it ties up all loose ends and actually provides a satisfying conclusion to such an epic journey. I think *Felina* did that.

What I did want to see was the family actually get the money, maybe Holly, Flynn, and Skyler's life after this ordeal and especially more insight into Jesse's future... but that wasn't necessary. Gilligan allows us to draw those conclusions and on the whole, those details aren't that important. I was satisfied.

My final feelings were it was a good show, especially the final seasons, I watched every episode. However, this show is VERY overrated.","1380585854"

* I plan to refit the chainring with a 50 tooth cog. I presume this will require removing 4 pins from the chain, or 2 links. Is this correct?

* If I did my math right this will be a ~8% gearing reduction (there is also a 44 tooth cog available for further reduction). Is this worth the effort? The current gearing is slightly too high for Seattle's hills. I have to go a mile at a 7% grade at the end of my commute, which ususally has me standing and mashing.

* On an unrelated note, I can take this bike apart and put it back together blindfolded, but adjusting the caliper brakes are a nightmare. What am I doing wrong?

I'd probably say bite the bullet and commute a little farther. Pick a public transit corridor (BART or AC Transit) and check farther down it.

"teenrelationships","t5_2t9th","Agh ill take a swing at this... While my answer may not cover it all nor some might agree it's just a different perspective.

Love is something very cruel and cold... It sets apart the strong hearten and weak willed, it will categorize the courageous and the selfish... for love will work it's way to the core of ones being and in an instance rip from them their heart mind and a part of their very soul. However, love is what inspires us to do so much, in its own way love is what fodders the flames inside of us and brings us into experiences we would never imagine doing! It compels us and rewards us and can be the most persuasive method. It is when you can work to being in the same room with that other person and either laughing crying fighting or sitting in silence you still worry about their well being. While this is just a speculation and honestly can be seen as over dramatized bullshit it is but the tip of an iceberg so big you can't comprehend the entity in a single lifetime for love is so much more than what one can say about it, it is the most valued commodity and irreplaceable resource for it does not come easily nor does it ever leave our minds, love is but a poison that takes us from a young age and entrances us in it's hallucinogenic grip until our last moments upon the earth. love comes in so many shapes and forms it personifies personification itself.


Simply enough, love is when you find something special in another person and when your alone or off living your day to day life it is a reoccurring undertone in you that you just can't shake. You just can't get them out of your mind and it eventually pops up in your mind more and more till eventually you can't face that significant other without you physically feeling a change in your body, let it be a sharp jolt a spike in temperature or coherence leaves the door, when you experience it you know it.

I think for the actual con themes, they don't tend to influence whether or not I attend. However I do enjoy a well executed theme, enough that it might influence my allegiance to a con. FWA did a fantastic job with ""Furries in Wonderland"" and I've seen cons where I couldn't even tell they had a theme (MFM I'm looking at you) I can see why FWA dropped doing the V-Day theme every year. 

The theme I think is absolutely important to drive interesting and new con programming and art. It keeps the cons fresh. It helps if the topic is broad enough and relevant that a lot can be done with it. I always say the furs make the con, but a well executed theme can relaly make the experience memorable.","1380585864"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","You responded with ""not really..."" implying that you were disagreeing with the general point of my comment that most people overestimate themselves and **belong where they are**.

If you didn't belong in Bronze/Silver, you wouldn't be in it. Trolls/feeders are not an excuse because **they are actually statistically LESS likely to be on your team than on the enemy team**.

&gt;I also never said we have perfect mechanical skills or reaction time. 

don't need to be anywhere near perfect to escape low elo

&gt;A good fed rengar can skill pretty much any ADC in one second.

Unless the ADC builds right and pays attention

&gt;Our strength comes in lane phases

I'm sorry but if you think the ADCs main strength is laning then you don't understand the game very well. If you mean that you and your friends strength is laning then that's probably true, but you don't deserve to be higher just because you can lane well. If you're not good at mid-late game (which is probably far more important than laning) then you are where you belong.

&gt; but in team fights, no matter how fed the ADC is, it's just simply impossible to win all the time if team gets caught out every single time.

You don't need to win ""all the time"" though. Winning 60% of your games gets you out of low elo in a couple weeks, if you play a few games a day. And 60% really isn't that outrageous. I won more than 60% in Silver and back then I really only belonged in Gold (which is as far as I got at the time). If you watch Diamond players smurfing in Bronze/Silver they tend to win upwards of 90-95% of their games.

&gt;but from my 300+ games in low elo, I always lose more LP than gain them

That means your MMR is even lower than your division, which is all the more reason to believe that you really do belong in low elo.

&gt;so it's pretty much impossible to get out unless you can carry the whole team single-handedly.

Not true, just gotta consistently play better than average. and even then most Gold players are expected to be able to carry Bronze/Silver games singlehandedly. If you can't, you don't deserve to be there.

&gt;Players should NOT be required to carry the whole team by themselves to climb the ladder, that's idiotic.

They're not.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","1) Currently the largest confirmed ship you can pilot is the Idris corvette. It's got room for 3 ships in it's hanger. As far as I'm aware, there's no current way of getting one without forking over $5k as part of the Marshal package until the game launches. There has been talk about groups being able to find and salvage larger ships (specifically the Bengal class) however how that works isn't disclosed yet. As for full fleet command over multiple capital ships, that's not something that's been discussed as far as I'm aware.

2) As for Multiplayer, SC plans to have instanced multiplayer support, some of which CR touches on here:
https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/12770-Chris-Roberts-On-Multiplayer-Single-Player-And-Instancing
It's from a while back, so things have evolved a bit, but it should give you an idea what they're going for.

3) There will be some stations that players can compete for control over, there will be boarding operations of ships and stations, and ground combat on planets - in fact the $20 million goal was for FPS combat on planets.

4) Currently, the subscription mainly helps make the weekly web show (take a look, see if you think that continuing is worth while...), gives you access to a private forum, tons of concept art, and gives you access to lots of concept art and a web magazine that's pretty nice that documents the making of the game and shows off some of the fiction and back story of the universe. They release Jumppoint snippets from time to time, so check them out, and figure that they're releasing about 15-20% of what's actually in each Jumppoint. Finally, there are supposed to be items coming to the store that will be exclusive/early release to subscribers - things like tshirts and whatnot, and I think someone's trying to talk them into making a SC towel as an homage to Hitchhiker's Guide.

Hope that helps!","1380585869"

Second reaction: waiiiit a minute.  In my past, I started going to Uni appointments and went a few times.. It was just weird between me and that therapist/psychologist.    

So then I went off and did my own thing for awhile and bam, yep. needed therapy (Never knew I had ADHD til I was 25 and by then, damn, was I depressed (oh, yeah, and throw in the fact that I'm a deaf person growing up hearing-minded).  So went to a different place a few years later... Whoa.  Big major difference.  I wouldn't be sitting here right now typing this up to you if it wasn't for this place.

SO. Please do not. I repeat, DO NOT. hold this against yourself OR this person.  Different people have different priorities, whether it's personal or professional or being pressured to fit the cost savings of whatever institution.  It's a road that I've been down too many damn times and... It's not worth it at all.  

So please stop that. You're putting part of your identity against the opinion of ONE therapist out of many different options, and even then, don't judge yourself against a person in the first place. 

I honestly cannot help you in what happened to you nor can I even imagine.  It gets better, though.  Take control of your own recovery.  Please. Know that you do have value, even though you may not see it right now.

"CivcraftExchange","t5_2tv59","Gah so much like real life. No definable victory or end. The experiment has succeeded ;).

Although yes, I have made a few creative farms, but even the resources those farms are for have little use in the grand scheme of things, simply because the end-goal is building. the purpose, as you've said, is to create/expand a city/nation/state. Or otherwise restated, is to establish/join a community that can enjoy building together. The final victory so to speak is enjoyment. And diamonds/XP/redstone/anything else becomes worthless after a certain point because farms --&gt; XP --&gt; Prot. And that's it.

There is no other use for any rare items because they are not used in the kinds of buildings that a community creates. And I have build a few of the factories in my nation on my own. It wasn't all that bad. However, even those factories reach an end to their usefulness. The most I can get from them is achieved relatively easily. Once I, and perhaps all my nation-mates, have been outfitted in Prot IV, fully potted, with nice swords, and plenty of pearls...all that is left is to build. To create, to imagine, and to engineer.

And here we come back to the beginning: There may never be items that are both useful and rare. Because the only end-game use that matters is building, and few items are of a scarcity that they cannot be obtained easily. Those that are, tend not to be useful to the end-goal of Civ/MineCraft.","1380585874"

Australian Law. Also the [Convention on Refugees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees) which Australian signed shortly after 1951.

The UN is not able to unilaterally impose law on member states.


**who decides the representatives on that council?**

Each country is able to assign representatives to the UN. Sort of like ambassadors. Further, there is a Security Council which is a smaller group, of which Australia is NOT a member. However Australia has been the [president of that Security Council](http://australia-unsc.gov.au/) for a while.

**what authority do they have**

The UN has only whatever authority is given to it by the member states.

**People smuggling, in its very nature, is illegal btw**

No, that's not true either. There are many shades of grey here. From [heroic deeds in the face of oppression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irena_Sendler) to simple [greediness and kidnapping](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/06/sex-traffick-romania-britain).

"gradadmissions","t5_2tn62","I'm not a grad student, but all the grad students I've ever talked to about grad school (as well as several professors) have strongly recommended taking time to do something else between undergrad and grad school. 

Even if you feel that you are 100% ready for grad school and would be great at it right away, you should be aware that there are many people who are very successful at grad school but who then cannot make a living in academia after graduation. This means it is a very good idea for you to have work experience outside of academia in case you need to fall back on it later. Before you go to grad school, you should read the Chronicle of Higher Education, look at the job listings and imagine that you are on the academic job market right now, and talk to people who have been on the academic job market (preferably, of course, in your field) at some point since 2008. Also try to find people who got their PhD in social psych and are now working non-academic jobs. You should have a serious backup plan for what you might do if you can't get an academic job, and part of that means figuring out what kind of transferable skills a social psych PhD can give you. If you can incorporate some industrial/organizational psych into your training, that field is quite employable outside of academia (I have read). 

If you wait, you have more time to polish your applications, strengthen your relationships with professors, apply for your own external funding (e.g. the NSF GRF), and research prospective programs. For example, your advisor is an incredibly important part of your grad school experience, and the more you can find out about prospective advisors before having to make a decision, the better. If possible, you should find current/former students of professors you're interested in working with, and ask them (preferably in person, in case they're leery of saying unflattering things in writing) what their advisor is like. 

When you enter a PhD program, you are making a decision about where you will live, what you will do, and who you will work closely with for the better part of a decade. It will be an intensive and lengthy experience that will shape the rest of your life. It is the kind of decision you want to take the time to get right.","1380585878"

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Jews weren't regarded as people by the Nazis.  They were dehumanized to the point where they were literally treated with no more respect than you would give to a lab rat.  America did something similar (but not to such an extreme degree) to the Japanese during WWII. 

Turning your enemies into things that aren't human also have the benefit of making your soldiers more likely to shoot to kill in battle.

This concept has been used to retroactively explain why the storm troopers in Star Wars were such terrible shots.

Taken from [this article](http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/sci/stormtrooper-aim-explained.html):

&gt;There are a lot of fantastic things about the Star Wars films.  The action sequences, the epic mythology, hilarious behind-the-scenes stuff.  But there are also a lot of logical leaps and flat-out ridiculous things that fans have to either ignore or mercilessly mock in order to still enjoy the films.

&gt;One of the biggest of these absurdities is the ridiculous failure of Stormtroopers to come anywhere close to hitting the protagonists in close-quarters battles, despite the fact that all the characters talk about them as being deadly precise and that we do see Stormtroopers lay waste during other battle sequences.  For years, Star Wars fans had to just dismiss this “Stormtrooper aim” as lazy or expedient filmmaking, but now Cracked says that there are psychological concepts and wartime statistics that can help explain it.

&gt;Studies of the behaviors of soldiers in war have revealed that, not only do most shots fired in battle go amiss, 80% of soldiers wouldn’t use their weapons at all.  They simply refuse to take part in that aspect of battle.  You would think that this aspect would be weeded out of cloned killing machines but, for all we know, Stormtroopers could have feelings, too.  And shooting at small groups of scrappy Rebel kids just trying to survive?  Might not be the most frightening or threatening of targets.
 
&gt;Cracked points out that Han, Luke, and Leia don’t seem to have a problem mowing down Stormtroopers, though.  For this, they cite the psychological concept of dehumanization, where people are more inclined to do harm to people they see as actually less than human.  This can be done in a variety ways – the Nazis did it through propaganda, all kinds of racial slurs do it, and, most pertinent to the Star Wars situation, uniforms.  The head to toe armor and face masks erased any hint of humanity the Stormtroopers might have had, making it far easier for the Rebels to mow them down.  Cracked also points out that this could account for why the Stormtroopers hit their targets more often in larger battle scenes with proper Rebel soldiers – the Rebels are wearing uniforms.

&gt;It’s doubtful that Lucas and Co. intended the poor aim of the Stormtroopers and high kill ratio of the Rebels to reflect these psychological facts.  In all likelihood, they just needed to inject action without disabling the main characters or slowing up the plot too much with convalescing heroes.  But this is useful information if a non-fan ever tries to diss Star Wars because of the poor aim of the Stormtroopers.  It’s not bad filmmaking – it’s Science!","1380585878"

1) I focus on the things I CAN do. Depression and my low self-esteem always tells me what I can't do. How about I focus on what I can do? I question myself out loud. I focus on just the task at hand. I find that when I'm unable to get out of bed, part of it is due to being anxious over all of the stuff I have to do during the day. I try to take the day one hour at a time. If that overwhelms me, half hour at a time. If that overwhelms me, just one task at a time. My whole world is just that one task, whether it is brushing my teeth, cleaning dishes, etc. I ask myself if I can get out of bed. Can I at least do that? Can I just brush my teeth now? Can I just take a shower now? This really builds my confidence.

2) I set a bunch of heavy duty alarms across my room so I have to get up to turn off the alarms.

3) I drink water at night so I have to get up to use the bathroom in the morning.

Nice post. I was and still am looking for a bachelor/1 bedroom in Mississauga for under $950 with hydro and let me tell you, there is no way in hell you will find anything livable for $800/month for even a bachelor. 

A lot of the prices you see on gottarent, 4rent, etc.. are outdated and when you call, expect $100 more than what is shown. Bachelors are nearly impossible to find, and if you do, the building is guaranteed to be infested with bed bugs and cockroaches. 

For basement apartments, almost all have tiny little window(s), and the  ""separate entrance"" means going through the garage.

Sorry to burst your bubble along with mine, but the rental market in Mississauga is horrendous. Expect to pay around $1100/month + hydro + parking for any decent 1 bedroom apartment.

If you recall, he didn't play that much better against the Vikings, but the rest of the team played good enough to not let it get away. That's only because the Vikings suck. When Jay is on, he's on. And he is on MUCH more than he is not. The difference this time was that, even though he was playing at Gabbert levels of suckitude, he held it together just enough to usher an attempt at the end, futile though it was.

There simply *is no one better to replace him with*. Would we rather a checkdown charlie that gives you none of the upside of Jay, but also with none of the downside? Would we prefer a Qb that is incapable of taking chances? If the stick you are using to measure with is based on the Rodgers, the Brees or the Mannings, you are wrong. Those guys are not who Jay can be, nor should be, compared to. The only way we get a guy like that is pure chance. What you *can* be sure to get is another run of absolute shit or a known stable take no chances QB that simply won't turn the ball over. 

I'll take Jay fucking Cutler any day of the week. He WILL win games, but he WILL lose some, too. There have been A LOT of Super Bowl winning QB's that have laid some shit sucking (ahem, Flacco? Eli?). The SB isn't only won by the *Elites* (though they DO have better chances).","1380585887"

In my opinion? No. I use him primarily because he was not a Jew, nor a Christian. Does being a Jew and/or a Christian automatically discount someone as a source, in your opinion? If not, we can talk other sources.

&gt; Please don't say that your evidence is in the Bible - a book which is full of nonsense and well-documented historical bullshit.

The Bible is not ""a book."" Naive. It's a series of books edited together and to give the same level of credence to all of them is just dumb. Genesis and Mark do not carry the same historical weight, so don't pretend like they do.

&gt; No miracles, no throwing out of money-changers in the temple, no talking to snakes, etc...., yes?

I do not know where these stories spawn from. Miracles can often be natural phenomenon, though misunderstood at the time. Take Lazarus, for example. Raising him from the dead would be supernatural. Waking him from a coma after hearing a good friend's voice? Not so much. You seem to be comfortable painting an entire event as fictional when it could just be exaggerated. I'm not nearly so comfortable in doing so.

An Islamic government does not mean converting everybody to Islam or killing them. It means governing by the rules Allah gave us. Wallahi, what's frightening is how people like you who are ashamed of their religion rush to adopt western social values regarding religion because of how inferior they feel. But as Allah says,

&gt;Do the people think that they will be left to say, ""We believe"" and they will not be tried?But We have certainly tried those before them, and Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars. [29:2-3]","1380585891"

FRICKING LOVE THAT SONG!!! It's my Driving to Work jams! I also LOVE S-a-i-l (didn't want to accidentally join the raffle). You have good taste in music.

Anything baby clothes or blankets on my wish list is for my amazing sister. She's always there to support me, and I can't wait to be an aunt to her incredible baby boy, due in December. Here's our funny moment. We are four years apart. When we were kids, we would FIGHT over the funny papers on Sundays. It was probably the only thing we really fought over. One time, she got the funnies before me and read them all, then handed to me. But as she handed them over, she BIT DOWN ON MY NOSE, and said, **CHOMP!** I was completely flabbergasted, and had no idea WHY she bit my nose! I freaked out and tattled on her, and got completely mad at her and cried.

Then I read the funny papers. One of the strips, I don't remember which, some strip where they had a dog and a rabbit for a pet...One of the strips had a bit where the dog and cat chased each other around, and when the rabbit finally snuck up on the dog, he BIT the dog on the nose, and there was a big word, ""**CHOMP!** on the last panel of the comic! I don't know WHAT possessed my 4 years senior sister to bite me on the nose, even WITH that comic strip, but for about **10 years**, we had a nose biting war. Occasionally, I'll still lean in and pretend to give her a kiss, and bite her on the nose. =)

No one is entitled to a profit.  In a market with perfect competition profits are effectively zero.

* full of anti-biotics 

* not vegetarian

"pockettrains","t5_2y1kx","I started out with something like your layout, but as you expand you'll find it difficult to move items long distances.  After you expand to North America, you'll have cargo arriving in Lisbon from New York, and after you expand to Asia, you'll have links from Volgograd &amp; Istanbul.  If you have a shipment from NA with a destination in Asia, you'll have to traverse **four** different railways to get across Europe.

I think your layout is fun for the early levels where you are mostly micromanaging in Europe, but you'll want longer runs in the future.

My tip is to take advantage of the connectivity of Munich (especially) as a transfer point.  So for example, I have lines from Lisbon to Munich, Volgograd to Munich, Moscow to Munich, and Scandinavia to Munich.  (And when I expand to Africa, I'll have a Casablanca to Munich run via Barcelona.)  There are other intersection points for layovers (Paris, Milan &amp; Budapest) but I can currently get from San Francisco to Beijing with three transfer points (Lisbon, Munich, Vologograd) involving two European lines instead of four.","1380585895"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","First off, for a writer, your post is a bit scattered. I'll be honest, it was tough to read. I'm just going to assume it was more of a rant, but you should really rewrite it to make your points more clear. But I'll do my best to give you some advice.

First off, frame is a more broad general concept that comes through emotional security and outcome independence. So let's use your example: First off, you need to understand that your frame wont make people like your art any more. Frame has nothing to do with that. If you respond with anger when they criticize your work, it shows them that you have a vested interest in their opinion. Also, if you respond with, ""I don't care what you think,"" you're also projecting your investment in their opinion, because you are making an effort to let them know you don't care. 

If you are actually confident about your work, you shouldn't get upset when someone is critical of it. However, you should always accept criticism with stride, it's a good way to find areas that need improvement. Handling criticism well shows maturity and willingness to work with others. But you shouldn't be too invested in what they say/feel. 

&gt; An example might be Art. Art is. not subjective. the art's subject is. But questions of style, technique, theme and mood are not. So when someone says ""This isn't a good example of Art Nuveau."" and someone else says ""Lol. Idiot, I like it."" and tries to break your frame, what is the proper response?

First off, I need to reiterate frame has nothing to do with being right or wrong. It has nothing to do at all with getting people to agree with your opinion. It has EVERYTHING to do with emotional security and outcome independence. See, in this case, you're too focused on someone agreeing with you. Who cares if they are wrong? Why do you have to prove to others you are right, and they are wrong. You're just going to make them feel stupid, and you gain nothing out of it. Plus, it's not that you're wrong, you very well could be right, but it's because you're being a dick. If you REALLY want to get this area under control, I would strongly recommend reading, ""How to win friends and influence people."" ","1380585896"

That's correct, and that'd be how you use them in (say) a lighter, compress it and you get a sudden voltage difference that sparks over a gap. But here you're doing the reverse - applying a voltage across the crystal and thus causing it to shrink or expand, moving your sample by varying the potential across the contacts.

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","I don't mind you asking, but there's not much to tell.  I woke up, one night, and I felt the strangest sensation.  I felt that I was floating above my bed, in the bedroom. The bedroom was pitch black, but I was wide awake.  At that moment, I saw some sort of seal or sigil, circular in design, but only a quarter of this circular seal.  I didn't recognize, nor do I remember it now, but I was bewildered because I thought, ""this didn't come from me.""  Meaning that I didn't think of that seal; rather it felt as though the image was placed in my head, or before me.  Then that's it.  I was out like a light. 

Part of what made me think that it was an OBE was the floating above myself, which is pretty typical.  I suppose that it could have been a vivid dream of an OBE, but I don't have much to go on, and, in the end, I'm not sure that it matters much.  

I have tried to consciously induce OBEs, but I haven't gotten very far.  Similarly, I've only been able to induce an LD once, and wakefulness left me as quickly as it came. 

I do regularly have intensely vivid dreams, and, like you have experienced dreams that seem to go on for much longer than I slept.  Trying to reason it out makes think that either there is another sense (as in the 5 senses, sense) which is a kind of ""time-sense"" for the lack of a better term, which would help us determine which memories are from long ago, versus recent memories. Then that sense could be at play at night during dreaming so that a newly constructed memory may only seem to be a long ago memory, and that would make it seem that we spent a longer time in the dream than we did dreaming it.  

Some OBE theorists believe that it in most OBEs, time is distorted, or doesn't function the way it does in day to day life.  

Even though I haven't gotten very far with it, I must admit I do simply enjoy these vivid dreams.  In fact, sometimes I feel just like your dream self who would prefer the dream world to the real world. :)","1380585901"

"YAwriters","t5_2vtil","Hi Beth! It varied depending on the book I wrote. My first novel, ASH, took me eight years from beginning to publication date. It took me that long because I was working full-time while I wrote it, and I did multiple drafts before I thought it was ready to submit to agents. That was about 6 years of writing and rewriting! When I began submitting the manuscript to agents, it took about 10 months to find my agent. My agent asked me to revise it briefly, which took another month or two. Once it went out on submission, we sold it within a few weeks. BUT ... then it took about 18 months to bring it to bookstore shelves. 

My second novel, HUNTRESS, took about a year and a half for me to write. My third took about a year, too. My fourth novel, INHERITANCE, which just came out, took the least amount of time -- about 10 months, but it was also my longest book (120,000 words!). I think it took less time because I already knew the characters, and I knew what had to happen.

"dawngate","t5_2x9kd","Regarding vim efficiency of tier 2 versus tier 3 items we pretty much agree in the group that some tier 2 items in their current state are simply **too** powerful, mostly the defensive ones. Rushing legendaries right now is strong, arguably a bit too strong, but it is also a big investment. Making the vim efficiency too high for tier 2 items could remove the incentive to rushing legendaries while these, my oppinion, **should** feel powerful and viable to rush over a couple of tier 2's and 1's.

The concept of Stackable Passives is an interesting one, I would like to see how that turns out.

Stacking aura items is a tough one though; balancing around the possibility of stacked auras either makes it so the item and its aura is useful on its own while being overpowered when stacked, or so that you are required to get multiple of the same aura item, limiting build diversity. Either case does not seem appealing, but I do like aura stacking so I guess it's a question about making it work without being overpowered, possibly through some sort of diminishing effect or similar mechanic.

The state of game in my oppinion is:

* Penetration is too accessible

* Some tier 2 items feel too strong (Aggression, Dicipline)

* Some tier 3 items feel too weak (Duress, Progress)

* Caster builds lack diversity

one of the core philosophies of LoL is streamlining the process of learning the game, while past MOBAs relied on complexity for depth, LoL removes pointless complexity while maintaining strategic/tactical depth. judging the delay timing of an ability is learned through practice, but there's value in decreasing the tediousness and amount of practice that's required.","1380585910"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","What I'm actually saying is that if your goal is hypertrophy, you can get it faster running a split than a novice strength program. If it's strength that's a different matter.

And well, it's not quite as simple as comparing progress. You would need a really large sample. Also, there are other variables to account for. It's not really a simple question at all, hence the debate.

This is all of course, just my opinion, because I can't really prove any of it, but I can provide anecdotal evidence from me and my lifting buddies that have done the same and show that you can certainly get very good results from starting with a split. Better? I think so, but maybe I'm wrong. ;) Either way, it certainly works well and having a strength base is by no means prerequisite to running a split and getting good results.

I've always figured curling 60 lb dumbells was a lot. I don't see many people curling more. Either way it's progress from 40 total lbs to 120 and I'm proud of that. My arms have grown about 3 inches.

I incline bench 220x8 and can squat 355x8 to parallel (powerlifter style). ATG I can't squat nearly that much but I mix up the two styles and am currently working on my ATG squat.

I started at around 100x5 and 115x5 respectfully.

Either way my goal really isn't to be strong. It's to be in good shape and to build muscle. Lifting more is just a side effect of that really.

The biggest step to becoming a better player is to blame yourself for everything that goes wrong and then figure out what you could have done better in that situation. For instance, if the enemy has a fed Rengar who keeps jumping out of bushes and killing teammates and you as the support are far ahead, use some of your gold advantage to blanket the map in wards and restrict Rengar's movement and benefit your team.","1380585913"

On top of that, the shit they put into the cows that produce the milk comes right through into us. Milk is one of the worst things you can drink (in the USA) right now. Don't believe the commercials that tell you how good it is for you. You know, the ones produced by the Milk Industry? No ulterior motives there.

Research it for yourself.

And for fuck's sake, don't ever feed that factory farmed shit to a child! There are healthier alternatives that taste just as good. An omni friend of mine recently switched his kids over to almond milk. He asked them to try it. Gave them the choice. They love it.

Eggs, under the right conditions, I do eat. The right conditions in this case being another friend of mine who has a bunch of hens on her property that she treats like pets. No abuse. No cruelty. No sifting through chicks and grinding males to death. No drugs / hormones. Top quality food. Good vet care.

For Kunkka, its pretty much like how you would lane against melee heroes, skill more into meld to have much more harass and melt him much more quickly. I guess that would work for Razor too since with a good level of meld, you could melt him before his static link reduces you to a chicken.

Let's talk about Lieberman for a moment.  Here's a guy who campaigned for the opposition, and was basically a piece of shit Democrat for years (recall his antics trying to get Clinton impeached).  [Neither Harry Reid, nor Obama applied any pressure to this guy during the health ~~care~~ insurance debates](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/21/lieberman-obama-never-pre_n_399355.html).  Such pressure could have involved taking away Joe Lieberman's chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee, or withholding DNC fundraising money.  Do you know who Obama did pressure during the health care debates?  Liberal congressmen who were told that they'd never see another dime of DNC campaign money if they didn't get in line.  While this was going on, Rahm Emmanuel was calling liberals ""fucking retards""

Obama took single-payer off the table before the debate even started, and then he completely blew a public insurance option (assuming he actually wanted one), protected recalcitrant Democrats who were pushing conservative ideas, and bullied liberal Democrats who were trying to hold the line on a public option.","1380585920"

"Sikh","t5_2rfo4","I completely agree! I have never understood why we do/did not proselytize our faith, instead opting to boast about how we are against it when, in fact, Guru Amar Das Ji had sent missionaries to preach Sikhi to various areas and sangats (albeit Sikh sangats as far as I know). We should collectively be doing parchaar, and importantly, in English (here in the North America at least) to get in touch with the youth. However, with the differing beliefs (Kes vs. Keski, Raagmala or not, etc) although small, are major hindrances in uniting Sikhs. If we can all agree on one Maryada that would benefit us a thousand fold more than we can understand. Instead, we have squabbling Sants and Parcharaks who say one thing or another - sometimes contrary to Sikh beliefs (heard a guy say taking your kirpan off is a kurehit and one needs to take Amrit again when this is completely incorrect) - and people who, maybe through personal belief, don't question what they're hearing in an attempt to be humble and less egotistical. I feel sometimes many Sikhs take the word of a supposed holy man, or fellow Gursikh, at face value rather than critically think about it for themselves and compare what they hear with what Sikhi teaches. True, some may be limited to accessing resources, but critically thinking about what someone says should be second nature. Anyway, sorry for the ramble, but this issue irks me a lot, not because we shouldn't discuss it, but because I feel many Sikhs would rather stay sedentary than do anything. Like myself.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","A few things decide what makes popular junglers popular.. 

mobility (where it's the ability to get around the map quickly, or the ability to make quick escapes whether in your own or the enemy jungle) - this allow for the champion to be a safe pick, while also increasing his dueling potential, also increases said champions counter-gank potential

clear speed (how quickly the champion can clear all of/the most important jungle camps, and effectively the gpm attainable by farming with that champ from the jungle) for example, rammus has extremely strong OTHER properties on this list, so for balance purposes (not saying intentionally, but how it ended up working out) his clear speed early game is atrocious. Often champions with the best clear speed are often the strongest of counter junglers, because of their ability to clear their own jungle and still having time to steal from the enemies (think shyvanna/nunu)

crowd control (the ability of said jungler to lock down enemy champions) generally quite crucial in ganks, and found heavily in champions considered often considered to be the most ruthless gankers (think rammus/fiddlesticks/nautilus) Simply put a champion with strong crowd control just makes ganks significantly easier for laners to capitalize on.

Other Strong Jungling Attributes - Dragon control. Champions that are naturally good at taking down dragon quickly (nasus/renekton/nunu/chogath) can be strong junglers out of this alone, because of the snowball potential that locking down successive early dragons has.
                                           - Pressure. Many junglers are picked solely for the extremely high pressure they can apply on the map via things such as early game damage, mobility, and/or utility. (think elise/lee sin/yorick)

This one is easy to spot if you know the historiography behind the Jefferson-Hemings relationship, but not many people may know the extent of the literature out there.  I've previously made [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/17fpl8/monday_mishmash_sex_and_scandal/c859kwy) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1eu0ab/is_there_conclusive_answer_to_the_jefferson/ca3ryqn) in /r/AskHistorians about writing on Hemings and Jefferson, including the DNA evidence that proved there exists a link between male Jefferson DNA and Sally's son Eston.  I [also have one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/17n2p4/theory_thursday_history_and_ideology/c871gqo?context=3) linking to some of the flak Barton (rightly) received when he published _The Jefferson Lies_ (in the second half of the comment).

The part where David Barton claims that the DNA evidence proved that Jefferson _didn't_ father one of Hemings' children and that Joseph Ellis recanted his conclusions regarding that evidence are both outright lies.  The Thomas Jefferson Foundation - which owns and operates Monticello - [acknowledges the DNA evidence shows Eston was Jefferson's son](http://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-brief-account), and Joseph Ellis [didn't retract anything](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/enigma/ellis.html).

For reference, here's the _much_ more respected historian [Annette Gordon-Reed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmwt59ewgjE) discussing the Jefferson-Hemings relationship in a presentation at the Library of Congress.  The DNA evidence, combined with the other circumstantial evidence we have regarding Thomas Jefferson's life, very strongly suggests that Jefferson fathered at least one of Hemings' children.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Well they settled in Canaanite lands among Canaanite people for centuries. Its more unexpected to find things not Canaanite, like their Heno/Monotheistic worship of Yahweh, or their dietary rituals. 

What xenophan is referring to though (and I have a feeling he's not familiar with the details) is a fairly widely held theory among historians that the Israelites did not come from Egypt or anywhere else, but that possibly maybe they were a lower caste of Canaanite. Its theorized that at some point the lower caste rebelled against the higher caste system, moved south, changed their diet, religious and cultural rituals, and eventually swapped out their polytheistic beliefs with Heno or Monotheistic ones. On top of this some scholars hypothesize that there *may* have been a very small group of slaves who escaped Egypt, and traveled north. On their journey they detoured and took refuge in Midian where they *may* have run into a nomadic group of people called the Shasu. The Shasu were broken into a number of tribes, and one of these tribes was called the ""Shasu of Yhw"". According to the theory, its possible that the name of the group, ""Yhw"", derived from their worship of a god by the same name. The fleeing group may have then continued north having accepted ""Yhw"" as their own protector god, when they ran into the ex-Canaanites. There, this group was welcomed, and so was their new god ""Yhw"" who eventually became YHWH. I don't think there's a whole lot of evidence for this, but its one of the theories currently floating around.

Anyways, xenophan is plain wrong about there not being any signs of Egyptian influence. So, for instance, in his book Israelite Religions, Professor of Old Testament and Semitic languages Richard Hess makes mention of finds like the following:

&gt;&gt;North of the present-day Damascus Gate, in and around the grounds of the *Ecole Biblique*, were found more than a century ago a fragment of an Egyptian stele mentioning Osiris, an Egyptian offering table, two alabaster vessels, a small stone statuette of a seated figure, and fragments of Egyptian lotus capitals. Near the end of the thirteenth century BC, an Egyptian temple stood here along what must have been the road from Jerusalem to the central hill country.

He also refers to Egyptian architecture and Egyptian-Canaanite plaques at a temple in Lachish. And also Egypto-Canaanite temples are found at Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Aphek and Jerusalem from the Late Bronze Age.

I highly suggest reading the books I've mentioned here by Kenneth Kitchens, and Richard Hess. I think that you'll find they're very balanced and offer up a detailed examination of both the current views in Ancient Israelite research as well as a number of alternative interpretations of the data. 

If you want a radical interpretation, you can also check out archaeologist and Egyptologist David Rohl's theories on New Chronology which posits that our current popular understanding of Egyptian history is off by a few dynasties. Its a controversial view among Egyptologists, but it seems to be picking up supporters. His book Pharaohs and Kings was used as the source of a set of documentary specials on The Learning Channel back in the 90s, and its a fascinating read.","1380585923"

It's pretty important for, y'know, a *dating* site, for example. I can't imagine someone thanking me for wasting their time because I thought they were too immature to handle a straight fact. Plus, if you'd tell a white person you're not into them but not a black person, wouldn't you just be infantilizing the black person based on their race? 

Also, there's that bizarre idea that truth is its own virtue. Truth is often ugly and unpleasant. That doesn't mean it isn't valuable, and in fact it's often the ugliest truths that are the most needed. Nobody needs to be encouraged to embrace the snugglier ones. Yes, there's such a thing as social graces, but wasting someone's night because you didn't want them to ""feel bad"" is not about protecting *them*, but *you*.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Bit of a rant here, sorry. Reading the comments on this article, I don't think people realise just how big a project it would be to 'just add SMS to Hangouts like iMessage'.

Scenario A) John has a Nexus 4 with Hangouts installed. Kate has an iPhone 5 with Hangouts installed. John sends Kate a message from his Nexus 4. Hangouts detects that Kate has the app installed, and that she has a data connection, so the message is sent through Hangouts. Hooray! But, wait. Kate is now replying to that message through Hangouts, but John hasn't got a data connection any more (he likes to turn it off now and then, don't tell him what he can't do). What does Hangouts for iOS do at this point? It can't send an SMS, because iOS doesn't have that functionality. So, it sends a blind Hangouts message which John won't receive until he gets a data connection again. So that seamless integration is suddenly dependent on who's using what. Again.

Scenario B) Claire has a New Nexus 7 and an iPhone 5S. Both devices have Hangouts installed. She sends an SMS to Charlie using her iPhone. Charlie's Nexus 5 receives it, and he responds. Does Hangouts respond via SMS, to Claire's iPhone, or does it send it over Hangouts? Both would get the message to Claire's iPhone (assuming it has a data connection), but one requires her to suddenly move to a completely different app on her phone to continue a conversation she'd already started. The other would only appear on her iPhone, and when she moved to her Nexus 7 the Hangouts conversation would be split.

Google does not have the luxury of control like Apple does. Google can't confidently predict every single usecase of Hangouts enough to have such a seamless experience like Apple does with iMessage. This was just me thinking off the top of my head for five minutes; I've no doubt Google has spent hours troubleshooting this stuff. To get over most of the iOS/Android compatibility issues, they'd need to build Google Voice into Hangouts, which itself is a large task. Google Voice is only available in one country, too. If they launch all these new features and restrict it to one country, Hangouts suddenly becomes gimped and segmented - which is exactly what they don't want.

This is completely ignoring the even bigger elephant in the room; OEMs. If Google really wanted market share, they'd make it a requirement of a future Android version to launch with Hangouts as the default SMS client. OEMs typically create their own SMS client based on the AOSP SMS client. They're not going to be happy to just give up that extra bit of freedom with the OS. If Google doesn't do that, though, nobody is going to even know what Hangouts does.

I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see iMessage-levels of functionality for a very long time, if at all. The more and more I think about it, the more I find it too big a task.","1380585927"

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","""The one where the tumblr fandom latched onto the sexuality of two characters ignoring the actually interesting character traits and interactions""

That one! The WtNV universe is such a fascinating place of joy and wonder and mysterious glow clouds, involving really interesting characters with so many facets to be explored; and to have people then making the series all about Ceil and Carlos snogging feels like they're reducing them to their sexuality. I find *that* annoying and offensive, as both a gay man and a writer. I'd hate to spend lots of time and attention creating a character who happens to be not-straight, and then have everyone care only about that character's sexuality while ignoring everything else. Especially when they wouldn't do the same to a straight character, because apparently straight characters get to be *people*.

transgay was meant as a counter to cishet! I don't think it's an actual term.

So here I am on an uninsured, unregistered bike without a license thinking if I obey all the traffic laws, I'll be fine, my friend can drive behind me to block my non-existent license plate. So here we are in the middle of nowhere Georgia when I come over a hill and you better believe it...a license checkpoint miles from the nearest podunk town.

For all we know, they're planning on midnight (somewhere) but getting ready for a crash that sets it back 12 hours.

Apparently you'll know when GTA V says it needs to download an update, that activates the ""Online"" part of your menu. But what happens after that is anyone's guess.

So I guess, just keep restarting your console all day until something happens?

The worst news is they can't stop it or fix it without being called racist. And as people point out the policies are in fact buggered they get dismissed as bigots instead of their points being addressed. To make matters worse there is an racist extreme right that the left is constantly -reacting- too, and unfairly labeling everyone as associating with.

Ultimately leftists have turned out to use orthodoxy, labeling, dismissive accusations and liberal use of the term 'bigot' to silence opponents and control the conversation.

Seen CoD played. Your matches are timed, usually inside of 15 minutes.

League, not timed, but can be over pretty quick, and doesn't usually extend to 60. But you can't quit midway either, so that's probably the closest you'll get there.

Instead I pretend not to speak English. Really works with my smiley face.

Exactly, it *is* pathetic. And it's simply because they don't see me as a person. In their mind, they're Mario, I'm the Princess, they're in the final castle and all the stupid friendship stuff they do is just to get them into my panties. Men who think like that aren't interested in me as a complete person, any kind of interaction they make with me is purely on what they've imagined me to be like and what they imagine our relationship to be like. The actual in and outs of day to day life together doesn't occur to them because getting a girlfriend is like an achievement they have to unlock.

I'm an American covert, that said I can recall many a commercial of my youth that ended with, ""... The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"" on the tv. If the Mormons can raise the awareness of who they are, can not the Khalsa?  Some would argue that it would be a waste of funds better spent helping those who need it. But, I posit, if the west knew who we are, the basics of the Guru's message, and that we are friends, neighbours and allies, how could it hurt? 

It was not prostelization that brought me to the joy of Naam, it was basic facts. My curiosity was piqued. ""God is one, his Sikhs strive to help all oppressed. None are excluded, all are welcome."" that was the first message I got, and if this one-time prospective Catholic seminarian is any example, basic knowledge is a great tool. 

My advice, if I were even remotely qualified to give it, is this: to all members of the Khalsa who have taken Amrit, tell people why you look like you do, what you believe, and that you respect and will fight for their beliefs as soon as your own. 

Not many will question a man in a yarmulke, people know what a Jew is. We need to bring awareness to the Kes, Turban and Kara (as the three most obvious signs of our faith). Will people not understand? Some will, yes. Some will ignore. However, if we reach a handful, what harm have we done? Knowledge is a gift. ","1380585950"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","There was another way of making a living as a composer, and that was as a church composer. Johann Sebastian Bach is probably the best example of that. He spent most of his career as the composer for the church of Leipzig, and as such was expected to contribute new music almost weekly to the service. He seemed to have ambition beyond that path, though, and would occasionally compose for some other reason. He was also a teacher, especially of his particularly large family (21 or 22 kids by two consecutive wives). One of his sons became the court composer of the king, and Ol' JS visited his son and performed for the king, very possibly on one of the new pianofortes that were becoming popular. When he went home he recreated some of the music that he had improvised on the spot using a melody the king provided (the king was a gifted musician) and sent it to the king as a gift called The Musical Offering. It contains some very clever musical puzzles.

I don't know the situation for royalties, but Beethoven was famous throughout Europe during his lifetime, and orchestras and publishers were keen to commission him for new works. He wasn't very prolific however (he wrote 9 symphonies to Mozarts 41 and Haydn's 104, for example) and would occasionally pass off the same work to more than one commissioner in different parts of Europe, knowing it would take a few years before the word got around.

In one night everything I knew about love changed.

As she was drawing, his gestures appeared. Water touched my feet, and I cried. It felt like he was trying to comfort me.

Looking at the canvas she realized again what she had done, and a darkness started to surround her. Wind running through her hair, salty tears in salty water.
 
Something surreal crawled upon her, as she looked into his eyes.

""Dont do this, I love you!"" It was the boy who she knew was always watching her.

He ran up to her, and pushed her away.

- I'd do a bit more research on what tickets you can buy as a red member; I'm fairly certain we can't get away tickets.  Whether the restriction is to season tickets or silver members I'm not sure.

- It's easy to get to Emirates as people have said; East Coast to King's X then overground to Finsbury park/Victoria line to Finsbury Park/Picadilly to Arsenal.  I wouldn't call East Coast cheap - no matter how early I book they cost me a fucking fortune.

- Alternatively, if you're willing to drive, park on the outskirts and tube it; much easier - you won't be able to park anywhere for miles around.

- Don't let lack of company stop you going.  I got a ticket off Twitter and went Sunderland away on my ones last season, none of my uni mates like Arsenal.

 * First question do you guys have corners you think can effectively shut down there receivers? The patriots relied a lot on Talib covering either White or Jones and shutting them down. It surprisingly ended up working and we were able to focus on other targets such as doubling Gonzalez at the line.

 * Ryan =/= Brees. Brees is a better QB. He throws to the open receiver more and overall has a better football mind. Now I'm not saying Ryan is bad but Brees is better.

  * There running game/backs are better then the Falcons. You have to commit more to stopping the runs and quick screens then just stopping the top name receivers. We effectively shut down there run game enough (probably due to Jackson being out and Rogers not being as good as expected) to force them to have to rely on the pass. 

All I'm trying to say is they are different teams. And although both have good offenses you have to game plan differently for both.","1380585964"

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","You need to understand what a loophole is before you can complain about its usage. A loophole, legally, is a way to evade observance of a law. That does not mean the loophole is extra-legal, but neither does it mean that the loophole is in keeping with the spirit of the law. The loophole is not a mistake but it does allow people to misuse the law.

For example, a person is supposed to pay taxes, but if I install a shul in my basement, get a few neighbors to daven there, I can declare myself a religious building and get a tax exempt status. The law exempting religious buildings was meant to help religious institutions, not individuals, making it a tax loophole.

If you want a kosher certified example, just spend time reading Neviim. The first perek in Isaiah is a lesson attesting to the fact that people were utilizing the sacrifices as loopholes to get out of acting like the holy people G-d wanted. They didn't understand that the sacrifices were instituted for when you made a mistake, not a license to commit criminal acts.

&gt;suggests that the author (of the Torah, Shulchan Aruch etc) made a mistake...

Aside from the fact that the authors of those books never said anything about riding the subways and that is subject to modern analysis and our potential for error, the author of the Shulchan Aruch has made a considerable number of very famous mistakes which are discussed in the commentaries, as well as in the Beis Yosef. It is far from a perfect document, but G-d didn't write it so what did you expect?","1380585965"

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","I think she hasn't come back well yet, but she might one day. I'd like to see her comeback in a smart and darker way to which many women could relate and many men could go ""dayum."" 

When I first saw her she was a hero plus more. She was about the truth and I'd like to see that return. Seeing her face the hard truths about what has happened to her persona would be a great start.

I've thought much about how I'd like to see her return and I want to tell it. Her new beginning starts at her lowest point. Fat, grungy and homeless. Given up on humanity and its lies and denials. Living in a shelter and listening on the street to guys talk about what they would do to Wonderwoman while reading an old comic not realizing she is right there.

Then to turn her around and make her want to come back and want to kick ass again, she'd see a girl and her mother come to a shelter. Battered and scared, these two would gain her interest and she would reflect on her childhood and how she became fierce and what it is to be fierce. The hero archetype would be back burnered for her and she would realize that idea of the mother and the girl are archetypes worth fighting for and not to be diminished by slopping them into other roles just because society has a hero addiction. 

A tragedy or near tragedy would happen to the mother and girl. Perhaps their abuser would find them. Kidnap the girl or hold both hostage. Something awful that would awaken within her something beaten, abused in the minds of so many fapping fools. And she would find the hero she is again and she would protect these people and what they represent and like doing it. 

Sensing her energy returned she would be contacted by her ancients by way of them sending an assistant and funds. A young Amazon quick witted but unsophisticated and longing for justice. This young one would help her come back fully and would be a good reminder to control the anger as seeing it in the young one would give her the insight to know better than to wildly flail at vengeance.

She would shape up in a montage I guess. Get fit and let her anger out in healthy but intimidating ways. This could be a very funny part. She would study technology and in the fine tradition of Enhance! would learn how to mod her long hidden tools into modern masterpieces.

Then she is back and her suit is not united to some country colors but tech-modded bad-ass girl with a dragon tattoo on her brain. All black to start again. The color of purification. That lasso, black metal, would have a kind of mind and would coil itself around her body seamlessly and continuously and would sense when she need it. Her cuffs would have all manner of awesome gadgets. And her hair would be a beautiful and scary display of raven spikes. That all would just be fun and more hornets nest kicker than porno queen. (I do think the Salander character is a decent place to gain some inspiration, sorry if that offends.) 

She would not be anti-male but a strong female and because very often to some that comes off as the same thing I see her making a point of showing that she is not a hater. Not killing the abuser, but making him confess to police but mostly to himself, she would destroy the monster within him. She'd kill that but leave his husk to deal. He would turn himself in and compensate his victims. 

She'd be back then and ready to join forces. She'd encounter the guys who'd been reading her comic and talking junk about what they'd do to her. And with one silent look from her, they would cower as if they'd been caught lying by a mother who knows better and apologize and have her back should anyone even try to sully her again.


Sorry about going on. I really liked her growing up, and I really loathe the idea of bringing her back poorly or to please that certain sect of comic book fan that has made loving comics a fight for girls sometimes. She could be amazing. She could be a true wonder, but not without the truth. Facing it, owning it and creating herself anew without shame or denial of where she has been. I don't see folks liking or respecting anything less and I suspect less is what has been envisioned concerning her. All that said, I haven't seen the bomb yet, but will. ","1380585966"

Well then you *alter* your building style -- you do ""balloon-frame"" homes (using faster growing cheaper pine) -- and when lath &amp; plaster get too expensive, you invent drywall instead.

Likewise with agricultural/commercial/implement buildings: heavy timbers not available? Then you switch to pole-barns with metal walls; or more recently to a [metal truss frame with stretched plastic/fabric](http://www.clearspan.com/fabric/structures/home).

And in a very REAL sense, it is the ""tightening of resources"" that then *drives* innovation.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","At first I wasn't going to get upset over Jinx(another ADC/Marksmen) getting immediately released after Lucian because I assumed Riot would tweak his kit a little before doing so.  But seeing as they only slightly improved his Q I'm unimpressed.  If Jinx ends up becoming extremely popular and viable than I have no choice but to see Lucian, a champion I enjoy playing immensely, a disappointment.  

Lucian fails to create a role that differentiates himself from the rest.  Is he a ADC that's strength is kiting or chasing.

**Is he like Vayne?** 

* She chases better.  Her passive innately increases her movespeed while chasing.
* Better at 1v1 in the later stages of the game. 
* Her overall damage scales way better.  

**Is he like Caitlyn?**

* She kites better.
* Brings more utility with traps and caliber net slow
* Maintains DPS in a teamfight better. 

As Lucian stands now 

* Is really strong at laning/aggressive trading until he runs oom which happens really quickly.*(Those mana changes are good but his costs need tweaking).*
* Has good mobility with his W proc and Relentless Pursuit  but honestly it needs to reset on all kills and assists not on his ult which you will rarely ever get kills with anyways.  
* And his ult.  I don't even know what to say about it.  It's fun to use because it's badass to rapidfire dualies.  But it's retarded because it's meant for a situation that makes it not fun to use.  When a team fight occurs every Lucian player will get this urge to want to push their R button and unleash their inner Neo.  The problem is it's DPS is so fucking bad that it's smarter to only use it in situations where you are unable to orb walk safely while kiting or you are chasing low HP targets.  

It's only useable in teamfights when:

* You're trying to run away from assassins or bruisers that tunnel vision you.

or

* Chasing low HP stragglers after a teamfight has already climaxed and you're just trying to go for aces.   

People want to be able to use it like a mobile version of Miss Fortune but in the end it's used like Caitlyn's Ace in the Hole almost because it's used more towards the end of a team fight not at the initiation phase.  Problem is Caitlyn's is much easier and safer to use even with the block feature.  The ult itself is really fun to use but the damage just makes it so unsatisfying.  

**It needs a damage tweak similar to how you guys buffed Bullet Time.  Maybe add an AOE component that deals 100% dmg to the first target it hits and reduced damage afterwards similar to Piltover Peacemaker.**

It's only been less than a month and I'm sure more changes will come out but having Jinx come out right after really irks me as someone who enjoys Lucian but acknowledges his problems.  I love the champion but I just want to get my opinions out before Jinx comes out and all the focus goes to her. He has the potential to be good but I'm scared he will just be forgotten like Quinn.

For p prime in Z the cases are, p=2 factors as above, p=3 (mod 4) is prime in Z[i], p=1 (mod 4) factors in Z[i].

That's one of the theorems, it's a bit much for a comment post to show it from scratch. But it's easy to show that p=3 (mod 4) must be prime. If a+ib|p then a-ib|p and a^(2)+b^(2)|p, which means a^(2)+b^(2)=1 or p, but in (mod 4), a^(2)+b^(2) is always 0, 1, or 2. You can show that by exhaustion.","1380585993"

Just a tip, if you like smaller mods you could always go with a 14500 mech mod, 18350s are generally shorter mods but just as wide as 18650s.

Volcano Magma 2

Volcano inferno 2 (eGo style)

iHybrid

Omega Mech mod

I could use something like...

When empath Vera Wolfe sustains an infection that turns her into a telepath of machines, she is compelled to join forces with an intelligent robotic ant in order to rescue her android lover and rid the last human city of a malevolent infestation.

Horrible, right? All of those things happen, yes, but the book is fantasy, not sci-fi. There's very little science going on. It's more of a speculative socio-political epic fantasy than anything the mention of robots suggests.

Or I could use this hook:

When Vera Wolfe is banished from Euphoria for her failure to comply with the draconian system of punishment and reward, she joins forces with a mysterious scientist living in the wild to investigate the true forces at work behind Euphoria.

That happens too, but again, does nothing to explain what the book is about...

It has been ansered in multiple instances, by multiple people, in multiple ways. This means that asking the quesion itself is irrelevant as the answer to it is already there, you dont even have to dig for it.

The way the tax brackets work is that the first $0-$8,925 you make is taxed at 10% then every dollar you make between $8,926 - $36,250 is taxed at 15%. So on and so forth util you reach the top bracket of $450,000. So whether you make $8,925 annually or you make $1 billion annually you are taxed the exact same on the same dollar amounts. 

Now, the reason we have these brackets is because the government recognizes that a flat tax rate would  influence the day to day lives of an individual in different ways depending on their annual salary. For instance if one individual made $36,250 and we had a flat tax rate of 20% they would owe $7,250.4 in taxes. That leaves this individual $28,999.6 to spend on his/her family (food, shelter, heat) needs.  An individual who makes $1,000,000 annually would pay $200,000 in taxes. Now that is a significant amount more then the first person but lets see how they are effected financial by this. So $1,000,000 - $200,000 = $800,000. Wow! This person could still buy an entire house cash in hand *after* their taxes! But the other guy can hardly afford home/food/heat on his after tax budget. The effect is staggeringly disproportionate. So in conclusion, the reason we have a progressive bracket system is because the government recognizes that at different annual salaries the effect is different. Taking $1,000 in taxes from someone who makes $10,000 has a much greater effect on the day to day shenanigans of taking $10,000 from someone who makes $100,000. 

So we easily defended *why* we have separate brackets. Now lets discuss why we should have more brackets in the top end. We have them because the weight of a tax is felt proportionally to the annual salary. So it is only reasonable that the weight of a tax should be continued to be felt proportionally. A person who makes $1,000,000,000 a year should have the same impact proportionally as someone who makes $450,000. But they don't. Once you hit a certain level of annual accrual of wealth you are 'capped off' in taxes. Now compared to everyone below $450,000 a year you have less and less burdens proportional. This makes it increasingly easier and easier to accrue more and more wealth. The further away from the upper limit of $450,000 you get the further you are from any significant impact of taxes. However, I would claim that the further up the brackets you go the more you actually depend on government operating. Joe Schmoe in California doesn't care if a federal highway from Florida to Georgia can make its daily delivery. But someone who makes $1,000,000,000 a year has a vested interest in that highway (or certainly a proportionally more vested interests in highways in general). What the anti-bracket people fail to inform the public of is that the more wealth they acquire the more they are dependent on the governments operations and so the more they should pay.","1380586004"

I've seen it happen repeatedly, and it's all the higher up's fault for failing to keep up.  Why does any of the above matter, regardless? It doesn't. My personal experience is as biased as yours is, and neither is even relevant to begin with because we're talking Professional enviroments.

Don't assume I don't know what the big numbers are. The graph shows me exactly what I expected, *and I addressed it.* The numbers behind browsers used by people who own steam and regularly do PC gaming are very probably different from the ones seen by those of he majority, because the majority includes both domestic and professional environments with all different forms of intended uses, includin the much, much larger percentage of people who don't even know gaming on PC is a big deal outside of browser games.

I am getting the hands of my closest family members, cave-painting style on my back. My mom, dad, brother, uncle, grandpa (despite his dislike of tattoos), and husband all opted to participate. My mom is excited, but I think that she is concerned that I will regret it because she kind of regrets one of hers (she has two). She was a little impulsive about it, but I've been planning my tattoos (I have more planned) for years, carefully considering content and artists. My mom and friends keep asking for pictures, although the outline was light gray hand-poke and barely visible. My brother is now considering getting one himself, and my dad doesn't seem to be super interested. He's more concerned about me finishing grad school and getting a good job. My husband is not huge on tattoos, but he loves who i am, and gets more enthusiastic the more is completed on it. 

For the most part I have gotten a good reaction to my idea, but I can't wait to see how everyone reacts when they see the finished product at Christmas. (I don't live that close to my family.) Many of my family are tatted up so I'm not worried. I am mostly worried about how my husbands conservative parents will react. At least I can easily cover it.

Itemization is always going to be stagnant once people figure out the ""right"" build.

I always thought League's design team was trying to balance it *right,* to make it more balanced and thus better, but years later and having seen the overhauls they've done it's pretty obvious that was never the plan. Instead the plan was ""change the game when people figure it out so we can keep them on the hook as long as possible.""

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","&gt; Retroactively arguing does no good, instead you should inform others of the choices that have been made and provide constructive criticism to Anet.

They can fix it by making ascended weapons faster to acquire.

&gt;Colin Johanson: Everyone, including casual gamers, by level 80 should have the best statistical loot in the game. We want everyone on an equal power base. The rare stuff becomes the really awesome looking armours. It's all about collecting the unique looking stuff and collecting all the other rare collectable items in the game &lt;snip&gt;

Just do that. Make ascended items something you can get very quickly and easily by the time you are level 80. Or even change the function of ascended items to not just having better numbers, if you still want to leave the optional grinding in-tact. 

No retro-active arguing needed. There was, last november, and has been a lot of stink about ascended trinkets, this is just reopening old wounds because it's not what we were promised and it's not what many of us want. We wanted a game without statistical gear grind, similar to gw1.

Ascended gear makes a huge difference when you account for a full set. Heck, even 5% more damage is a huge buff. But it's much much more than that when compared to an exotic vs ascended set and it will only get worse as more ascended items are released.","1380586038"

From that Wiki page, there are two basic spousal privileges. 

The first (communication) protects what you say to your spouse, or what your spouse says to you. This means that if your spouse is in court to testify against you, and wants to testify against you, your lawyer can object and your spouse will not be allowed to testify.

The second (testimonial) protects you if you are called to the stand to talk about your spouse. When asked a question (e.g. what did your wife say about the murder?) you can invoke the privilege to avoid answering the question, a little bit like invoking the 5th amendment. ","1380586042"

"HaircareScience","t5_2y8kx","I used to think that I had really oily hair so I avoided conditioning and the like (it's very fine and flat, too). Turns out my hair was actually desperate for moisture, which is why the next day after washing my roots would look disgusting and the rest was fine. 

I started using the following routine and I love the way my hair looks now. I constantly get compliments now!!

1. Joico Volumizing Shampoo (green bottle). It's very gentle but gives insane volume. I can actually let it air dry with no additional products if it's a lazy day and it looks fine. Once or twice a week I mix up a spray bottle with warm water and baking soda and use that to get out buildup gently. If I've used spray starch or a crazy product, I use John Frieda Full Repair shampoo first to get it out.

2. John Frieda Full Repair Conditioner and Full Repair Deep Conditioner. I personally use both and it has never weighed down my hair. Finally moisture that doesn't make me oily!!

3. When I get out of the shower, I gently squeeze out excess water and use a detangling comb. Then I look at how gnarly my hair is to decide how many leave-ins to use. 

4. Once my hair is just damp, I use Neutrogena Triple Moisture leave in cream, concentrating on the ends. It's light enough I can use the residue on my hands on the top by my roots with no problems. 

5. I then use GVP root lifter spray (generic of Matrix Amplify spray you can get at Sally) and John Frieda Luxurious Volume mousse for extra volume. 

6. As an extra seal of moisture, I like to use organix Brazilian straightening oil. I use a really tiny amount and apply it to ends only. 

7. Blow dry with a nice dryer (I use one n only brazilian tech keratin dryer) upside down, concentrating on roots. When about 80% dry, I switch from warm to high heat and apply a shine spray (I like the Tresemme one and the keratin shine one organix makes). 

8. I let my hair chill out a bit after drying. Sometimes while still warm from the dryer, I'll put just the top up in a claw clip in a huge poof to get the shape I want and sort of set it while keeping it out of my fave during makeup. Once it's chilled out and cool, I take out the clip, brush it out thoroughly and add Oscar Blandi lacca hairspray (light mist only) then brush again carefully to distribute. I get it cheap (about 8 dollars a can at tj maxx) and it keeps my hair from getting piece-y over the course of the day. it smells very strong in the air, but I can't smell it on my hair. 

That's what works for me, YMMV. Try to moisturize your hair adequately and wash it only when you're going somewhere or it is truly disgusting looking. it sucks at first but over time, your hair adjusts.

I think everyone asks these things, but for me, it was like why bother.  I become really complacent and just, I dunno, lazy, un-motivated to do things I actually want to do. And ya, really fuzzy thoughts, and having feelings and not knowing why I feel them. I haven't always felt the physical stuff, just when I get really depressed.  Like, if I were to try to speak no words could come out.  Or, when I try to speak it's just garbled mush, and not true to me.  It's just surface, first response stuff.  Lies in a way, because when I come out of the fog, I can see better.  

My whole life I have felt different.  I have always felt foggy, and that no one understands what I'm really saying.  (which could partly be me too) The haze and fog, I dunno if it's from too many thoughts, or what. I have also done drugs, random pills/pharmaceuticals, smoked weed for a long while, nothing really helped.  I've been on prescriptions, nothing like that ever really helped.  I think I am lucky because I am fairly high functioning. I have a job and I don't have friends right now, but I just moved and am saying goodbye to my old way of life.  The only thing that has ever helped me is meditating, and Reiki.  I know Reiki is BS to a lot of people, but the things I have experienced while practicing are inexplicable.  Masuro Emoto and the rice experiment are a really interesting take on energy.  Meditating takes serious practice, but it is the only thing that has ever helped me.  I love Thich Naht Hanh and pretty much anything he has ever written. I don't know if it will, but I really hope this helps! You are not alone.

It becomes problematic when you say that men have penises because the terms man and woman are terms of gender. Not all men have penises and some women have penises. This is speaking to their gender not their sex.

So the public eye is only on Qatar and this problems because of the World Cup, and the working conditions will most probably improve because of that since the Qataris have no other choice as to improve them to avoid more opposition. 

We as normal Football fans have no means at all to do something against it, more important even if we had, a Boycott or any related actions would only hurt the people you are trying to protect, because if the World Cup would be moved away from Qatar this people would be out of work, and I don’t think that they would appreciate that.

Running over the person that was ASKING to be run over with his gang of OFFENDERS and SAVAGES is completely justified.

I think this is the main issue with writers, it's a writers nature to be careful and methodical in most cases. You only have few exceptions like Hunter s Thompson and Hemingway or Bukowski. I am not a natural writer but I have experienced some ridiculous life events and because of that i feel compelled to write about them...weather I convey the sense of being there, or not, is the difference between good and bad writing...but a well written book or screenplay, is pretty worthless, without a great story behind it. I honestly think most writers completely miss this fact, and most of our pop culture is littered with trash or far fetched nonsense..because not enough writers are willing to get out there and live to generate new and worthwhile stories.","1380586079"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I would say that a good place to start may be with doing non-sexual but close things: cuddle while watching a movie, lots of hugs, that sort of thing. Connect with each other without worrying about genitalia. Maybe do some making out or awkward PDA or whatever without thinking about sex as the next thing. Be naked together. Hang out on the couch in your underpants, sleep naked, whatever. The main thing is for you both to be comfortable together in your own skins. This will probably be really good for her since she's had several bad experiences in the naked department.

People here often say not to mess around with ED stuff, but honestly if your doctor doesn't want to prescribe them for you, even one of the herbal pills you can get at your local dildo emporium might be a good idea--it gives YOU the confidence to do your thing. I can't speak to the safety of them, but a few brands have been around for several years without FDA recall, go for them and not the 'newest latest greatest.' She should look into her libido issues as well. Just because women stereotypically are portrayed as not wanting sex as often doesn't mean it has to be true.

To help on the pain front, check out some good lube. Especially if she's on BC or any of whole host of other meds, she could be having lubrication issues. Buy her a nice silicone or glycerin-free waterbased (I always recommend Jo, Pjur, and Wicked, but Sliquid, Swiss Navy, and Vie are great too. Whatever you do, avoid Astroglide, ID, &amp; KY, especially the Yours/Mine, like the plague) lube.","1380586080"

**Walmart** 

$20.7million/2.2million employees=$9.40

**ExxonMobil**

$40.3million/76,900=$524.057

**Chevron**

$32.2million/62000=$519.35

**Phillips 66**

$14,423,038/13500=$1068.37

**Berkshire Hathaway** Buffet is an outlier because he gets the majority of his wealth from the appreciation of shares he acquired when he bought out the original Berkshire Hathaway(a textile company) and not from any sort of compensation package.

$423,923/288,500=$1.46


**Apple Inc** Is another outlier because Cook received some 1million restricted shares(then worth ~$700million) half of which he can not sell until 2016 and the rest of which cannot be sold until 2021.

$4.2million/800,000=$5.25

**General Motors** Again an outlier because the federal government still owns a significant portion of GM, though his compensation is 44% higher that last year.

$11.1million/212000=$52.35

**General Electric**

$25.8/305000=$84.59

Here are a list of notable US Banks. Which should have larger numbers because of the ratio of employees to money handled.

**JPMorgan Chase**

$18.7million/285,965=$72.21

**Bank of America** CEO compensation is up 70% this year

$12.4million/262,812=$47.18

**Citigroup**

$11.5million/259,000=$44.40

**Wells Fargo**

$19.3 million/269,200=$71.69


If there are any other companies you would like me to list just say so(or look it up yourself, I took the number of employees from the respective wiki page and the CEO compensation from a google search).

"astrophotography","t5_2raop","can the telescope be removed from the mount? is it an equatorial mount or an alt/az mount? if alt-az, there is a limit to how long your exposure can be; alt/az mounts suffer from ""field rotation""... see [u/ForrestTanaka](http://www.reddit.com/u/ForrestTanaka) 's video tutorials on youtube.

you might want to experiment with exposure lengths - you might be able to get away with a little more than 10 seconds.

a green cast is common since ""one-shot color"" cameras like DSLRs have 4x4 grids of red, green and blue pixels; there are 2 green pixels per 4x4 grid. the signal to noise ratio in the green channel is therefore better than the other two channels.

if you read the documenation for DSS you can see how to use dark frames. using darks will help cut down the thermal signal that accumulates.

there's no line for piggybacking as long as you are on an equatorial mount, your polar alignment is good, and you are using a guidescope. you can even use the ""main"" scope as a guider when you are shooting with the DSLR+lens (but you need a guide camera, like an orion starshoot autoguider or a Meade DSI)

edit: after pixelpeeping your image, i can see that you are slightly out of focus. it's not easy to get the focus dialed in without some help. if you buy BackYardEOS for camera control, it has a nice focusing module which uses live view, and helps you dial in the focus, but you have to be pointed at a pretty bright star, like vega or deneb or altair... another method is to make a bahtinov mask (a special diffraction pattern); when you are in focus the star image forms an X shape with a line exactly thru the middle of the X.

&gt;The only reason you gave was that if you ult an illusion you would lose the spell to its cooldown.

I wrote:

&gt;If it doesn't work on illusions, it's not good design for multiple reasons. If you straight up can't cast on illusions, then you'd be able to identify whether the target is the real hero or not. **If you cast on an illusion and fail, then logically it doesn't really make sense based on what I responded to Tripwyr's post.**

So I did give that reason, just not in this specific post. Anyway you and other people are free to debate about this issue with the designers. Feel free to PM Buro and/or DOGKaiser about this =).

I am agreeing with the current iteration because that's what makes the most sense logically. I also believe that it has fair balance because of what you gain from the ultimate, not what the ultimate actually does to the opponent. In other words, it does nothing to the targeted hero directly.","1380586090"

"science","t5_mouw","X-posting my previous comment on this subject (new articles with vague doubts expressed by misinformed skeptics show up on this subreddit weekly):

If you're on /r/science you must respect the idea of scientific consensus, no? Well the reality is, despite a rigorous, primarily politically motivated misinformation campaign that has swayed the public opinion to an alarming degree, there *is* a scientific consensus on the matter of anthropogenic climate change. What people seem to forget, for whatever reason, is that the study of climatology is a field of *scientific research*, and new research is subject to the same rigorous standards as any other field. Here's some information:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change

&gt;The scientific opinion on climate change is that the Earth's climate system is unequivocally warming, and it is more than 90% certain that humans are causing most of it through activities that increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels. In addition, it is likely that some potential further greenhouse gas warming has been offset by increased aerosols.[1][2][3][4] This scientific consensus is expressed in synthesis reports, by scientific bodies of national or international standing, and by surveys of opinion among climate scientists.

The regularly issued IPCC synthesis reports provide a succinct summary of the prevailing thoughts behind peer-reviewed research published by climatologists. But these are not the only resources we have to support the conclusion that a consensus has been reached.

Here's what the scientific bodies think from the above wiki summary:

&gt;**No scientific body of national or international standing maintains a formal opinion dissenting from any of these main points:**
    *-Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as evidenced by increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, the widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.[5]
    -Most of the global warming since the mid-20th century is very likely due to human activities.[6]
    -""Benefits and costs of climate change for [human] society will vary widely by location and scale.[7] Some of the effects in temperate and polar regions will be positive and others elsewhere will be negative.[7] Overall, net effects are more likely to be strongly negative with larger or more rapid warming.""[7]
    -""[...] the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time""[8]
    -""The resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded this century by an unprecedented combination of climate change, associated disturbances (e.g. flooding, drought, wildfire, insects, ocean acidification) and other global change drivers (e.g. land-use change, pollution, fragmentation of natural systems, over-exploitation of resources)""[9]*
 ; the last was the American Association of Petroleum Geologists,[10] which in 2007[11] updated its 1999 statement rejecting the likelihood of human influence on recent climate with its current non-committal position.[12]

What the published articles show:

http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article

&gt;We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, examining **11 944 climate abstracts** from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. **Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.**

And what the surveys show:

http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/06/04/1003187107.full.pdf+html

&gt;Here, we use an extensive dataset of 1,372 climate researchers and their publication and citation data to show that (i) **97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change**, and (ii) the **relative climate expertise and
scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.**

http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf

&gt;**It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes.**


This is not a political issue; what Al Gore or Dick Cheney think about global warming does not matter, and what the hardcore liberals or hardcore neocons think does not matter. What matters is the science, and the science overwhelmingly points to one conclusion. You can't just wash over tens of thousands of peer-reviewed published articles and the massive scope of the research efforts of the international community as ""whatever, they're biased."" Then why believe anything agreed to by the scientific consensus? Why believe evolution or continental drift or quantum theory or the theory of gravitation? The issue in question is a very simple concept based on rock solid data and already observed phenomena. As for the climatological models, all undergo extensive testing, especially against previous global temperature records, with ranges of accuracy that are well-understood and scrupulously adhered to in published results. It's sad to see people's projection of their ignorance of the mechanisms behind anthropogenic climate change on those who actually research it.


Also, [here's](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png) a graph that may help you grasp the already observed warming trend. From this article:

http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2013/09/paleoclimate-the-end-of-the-holocene/

And [this image](http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Carbon-T-F.jpg) also shows the projected warming by 2100 with respect to Holocene temperatures. Produced from the results of this study:

http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6124/1198.abstract

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I live in England, we are a family of three, one child and two adults, we live in an area of seasonal work, with very few skilled jobs, no industry, its a beautiful, safe part of England but employment prospects are very slim, I cannot even get a job as a early morning cleaner, and the trades I learnt 20 years ago are not existent in this area (Sheet Metal Work and Carpentry) I worked for Royal Mail for a long time but was medically retired due to health issues. 


Anyway, one of us works full time, the other is a house parent, in full control of running the house, raising a child, etc. In years gone by like my parents did this was enough for a family to survive and to have a decent living, when I was growing up my father worked a 45 hour week, my mum was at home caring for us, looking after the house etc, we had a car, we had a holiday abroad each year. We had food, we had everything a child and his parents could hope for. 


Six months ago our income was roughly £370 per week, that was £200 per week in wages, £120 in Working Family Tax credits, £20 pound per week in Family Allowance and the odd £30 a week I could scrounge together making the odd website, helping old people with their PC's etc (To those not from the UK Tax Credits and Family Allowance are benefits paid to working people for working and help to top up wages, most working people in the UK whom earn under £50,000 pounds are entitled to some sum of money)


Out of this £370 we pay £150 in rent (To live in a property surrounded by crack heads, alcoholics and general scum bags, we do not live in a mansion) £25 in Water Bills, £25 in Gas and Electric, Council Tax at £25, We have Basic Sky TV, House Insurance (About £10 per week) £80 for food (Including schoold dinners) We have two dogs, £14 a week in food, Phone Line, Broad Band, Mobile Phones on very basic packages and phones, and the occasional night out for the one of us that is working about £30 per week. Clothes for the child maybe a few pounds per week so there is our weekly budget, we just about made it through each week, everything was fine, some may say our life choices are a little excessive, and yes we could get rid of the TV and Internet Access and mobile phones and dogs.


But when we got the dogs (And they're the only thing that keep me sane) things were different, the cost of living was not as high, unemployment was not as high, why should one of us be working full time and not able to have a few basic luxury items (Sky TV, A basic mobile phone, Facebook and farmville) One of us works very hard and a few luxurys should be allowed, its not like we're smoking 40 ciggarettes a day and drinking a bottle wine a night each.


Anyway back to the story, six months ago we had to renew our tax credits, for the readers outside the UK every year you have to tell the Tax Credit Agency how much you earnt, if anything changed etc etc. The renewal letter came through, and our Tax Credits had been halved, we now recieve £60 in tax credits each week,  So we're down to £60 a week in tax credits, I guess one could look at the above and say, hey there goes your food budget, this is generally down to Conservative Government cuts, I cannot find a job, if I did I would then need to pay about £120 pounds per week to a nursery to look after my child, and in this area the best I could ever hope for would be a part time job working in a supermarket earning £120 a week, but I would be happy to do that I would have some sense of pride, knowing I was contributing to society, walking home in some kind of uniform ""Hey look he works at......"" not ""oh god its that bum again""


Our current lifestyle is this, my wife lives on soup, sandwiches, jacket potatos, cereal, my daughter is well fed, I ensure that, she has fresh fruit, pastas, rice, meat, fish, school dinnners, a good diet, I myself, this past week, I skip breakfast, I have toast for lunch, three nights a week I have cereal, sometimes a cheese and ham toastie, occasionally I will get a box of fish fingers and some oven chips and me and my child will share that, a sandwich,  fish sticks and tonight I had cereal again. 


I own two pairs of jeans, and if I drop a pound and pick it up i'm getting arrested because the crotch is gone and I will flash the world my backside, I have two t-shirts, two shirts and a knackered pair of trainers that leak. 


I walked up the high street yesterday, there was an advert in a shop for an apprentice, £100 for a 40 hour week, working in a shop, I wanted it, but I cannot have it, because apprenticeships are only available for 16-18 year olds, it gets me a foot in the door and valuable experience in a retail environment, its my time, why can I not sell myself for £2.25 an hour, its my time, my life, and its an opportunity. The real kicker is its been there for 4 weeks, 16-18 year olds do not want this apprenticeship, they can earn £3.00 an hour on minimum wage, the lady in the shop has had a lot of interest from people that are too old IE me, but 16-18 year old wont take it. 


Life in England in some parts is not great for working families, I am sure our current Government said in their election pledge they would ensure working families would be better off, and yet every working family I know seems to be worse off, I apply for every job I can, but my experience is in an industry that is nigh on deceased, if you owned a shop would you employ me on £6.50 an hour (The legal requirement) or employ that 17 year old over there on £3.25 an hour (The legal requirement) I know whom I would choose if I was running the local supermarket.

My parents (like most parents, I'm sure) have a few stories they love to tell new girlfriends when I bring them over for the first time. My love for Married with Children is one of them.

No matter where I was, what I was doing, or what stood before me - if I heard that intro song come on, I was in front of the TV dancing. Which brings me to my next point, I was around 5-6 and I heard that oh-so familiar melody coming from the livingroom.. The fact that I was completely naked, covered in water and soap from my bath - I still ended up out there shaking my wangy. Always an embarrassing story to be told to a fresh new girlfriend.","1380586113"

When it comes to the lore, if a raiding party becomes large enough it looses the element of surprise in attacks and makes traversing the wastes more complicated for a number of reasons including logistics. When your nomadic group reaches a certain size, settling land and establishing agriculture will provide better returns than having to move such a mass of people endlessly through the wastes raiding settlements. Focusing on the games, I think it can be argued that Caesars Legion can be classified as raiders and they are a faction rivaling the NCR which may be the largest faction in the Fallout Universe. The Great Khans, Ashurs gang in The Pitt, Carbon Raiders, Vipers and Jackals are all supposed to have large armies in their respective appearances.","1380586115"

I guess the dynamic I dislike is where a team will catch one or two people out of position, get them low, and then just rush down middle slowing their recalls, then taking tower+inhib before they can heal back up. Teams also often neglect to defend inhibs for fear of getting aced, and that's why some games take soooooo long to close out, because teams just back off and give up an inhib or two for that chance to come back if they respawn.

Lets say you came up behind someone, and you hit them really hard over the head with something sturdy, like the butt of a Pistol. You wouldn't knock the guy out, you'd seriously injure, or kill him. 

At the top of you head is a area called the ""Frontanelle"". This is where three of the bones that make up your skull are fused together. This spot is quite a bit weaker than your forehead or the sides of your head, so its very easy to break. If you reach up and poke around on the top of your head, you can feel how weak that area is. Breaking the bones there would could send bone shards into the brain, and would be very painful in any case. 

Using a strike to the Frontanelle with a handgun has became some sorta super-ninja move in Hollywood. This is more because the Directors don't want the bad guy to die than it is grounded in reality. The truth is, if your in a situation where its justifiable to have a handgun out, the only thing you'd better be hitting the guy with is a bullet. Doing otherwise would imply that the gun, or even any sort of force, wasn't necessary in the first place.

These devices, when plugged into a network, simply poke holes in a compatible firewall using UPnP, and basically sit there on the edge of the internet advertising themselves.  

Some hacker gets word of this, then decides to scan the entire 1 billion address internet searching for exposed cameras.  This data is then compiled, and then piped to the Google Maps API in a stroke of genius.  This was the first security compromise that actually frightened me - people could click on a map and see inside someone else's home - watching silently while they slept, fucked, or did normal human things.

Brilliant.  And I should also point out that this is entirely unpatched - the map has since been taken down, but the exposed cameras are still sitting there - waiting for someone else to come along and do the same thing....  and you know people are.","1380586117"

Do you get off on self-sacrifice and eagerly anticipate the sympathy you'd get for ""my boyfriend is in jail for 10 years,"" and/or sorta get off on fucking with people who would judge you for staying with him?

I'm not asking these questions to criticize you or put you down, just that those are some of the reasons you would do something like this, and if you want to have this sort of relationship you should be honest with yourself about why. Because, frankly, there's no way you can't find at least one guy on the outside who you could be with. Something about this particular guy and his situation is floating your boat, and to make an informed choice about having a relationship with him, you should do your best to understand what it is. If it's something you're okay with, go for it. If it's something that concerns you and you'd rather change, try therapy instead.

Even though no scientific studies have ever proven that large doses of vitamin C can prevent or cure colds, many people still think this is true. You may have heard claims about other benefits of taking large doses of certain vitamins. But using large doses of vitamins to fight disease in humans is not supported by the available scientific evidence so far. In fact, large doses of some vitamins or minerals have been shown to be dangerous and even toxic. For example, too much vitamin C can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb copper, a metal that is needed by the body. Too much phosphorous can inhibit the body’s absorption of calcium. Large doses of vitamins A, D, and K are not eliminated quickly by the body and can reach toxic levels when too much is taken.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;You do realize there is no other way to deploy apps on an Android tablet apart from a Store.

Wrong. You can download .apk files from any website, copy it to your Android device, and install it directly from that file.

&gt;Which you will forever be able to do on Windows.

Wrong. For Windows 8 and RT, Microsoft has started placing restrictions on Metro/Tile interface Apps, which are only distributed through their store. Those are completely separate from plain-old programs, while makes no conceptual sense, but it is Microsoft's early steps to locking down Windows so they can profit off program sales like Apple does.

You are incredibly ignorant about the entire situation. The restrictions are what alarmed Valve and other devs in the first place. If that hadn't happened, they would have no reason to explore alternatives to Windows.","1380586119"

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","You have to be willing to spend money on parts when you see them and realize you may sit on those parts for years and years and years.  Learn what the retail and whole sale prices are for the vintage pens you are restoring.  This will help if you know you can't really sell an esterbrook for more than $45, then you can't buy them at $30, restore them and sell them for any kind of profit.

You also have to be willing to take a perfectly good pen apart to use it to repair another pen.  I did such a thing this week.  Took apart a perfectly good skyline so I could use the gold filled derby for a customer's repair.  Now they are going to pay me a decent price for the part, but as I like to say, go find another one.  :)

Your investment in parts and tools will eventually pay off over the years.  If you only want to use it as a means to subsidize your hobby (and who doesn't want to make some money so they can get the pens they want cheaper) then don't offer up a repair service, just buy pens cheap and resell them.  It's a whole lot less nerve wracking then repairing someone else's pens.  ;-)

And lastly, if you plan on doing this at any reasonable level, NEVER outright sell your parts.  I know that might sound a little harsh, but someday I'm going to need that cap for a green cracked ice Esterbrook, and it's going to mean the difference between a $1000 pen and the $150 I get for it as a cap. Same goes for the #8 sized AA Waterman nib I have.  Someday I'll find the rest of the pen for cheap because it doesn't have the nib and then I have a very nice, and valuable, pen.

Good luck!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's a complicated secret and it's mainly in parts and all about me. 

I have felt like an empty shell of a person most of my life. I was never good at school but somehow managed to do decent. Well enough to have all my family think I am above average intelligence. In truth I feel really stupid.

I don't feel like I remember anything from school. I don't feel like I can learn anymore. I feel empty in my head and body. 

I have a tendency to worry too much about what others think and this has cost me most of my friendships. I have never felt like any friend has actually liked me or treated me as well as I treated them. I always feel like an acquaintance. 

I have been fat my entire teens and into my 20's now. At first I kept telling myself I didn't care and then I got to a point where I would put it off every week, month, year. Now I am going to be 23 tomorrow and hate myself and feel like a mess of ugly and it's disgusting. 

I am too scared to kill myself so these days I feel I should stay fat cause eventually it will take me out. 

I feel alone, unable to take care of myself so how can I expect to find someone. If you can't take care of yourself... how can you support a partner. I feel like I have a lot of love to offer but that's it... I am not special... 

I keep changing majors and dropping school because I am lazy and scared I can't do it. Even though I never truly gave it an honest shot. 

I am lazy... so so lazy and regret so much because I have no talents or skills. 

My family and friends think I am okay. I am honest in some ways and they know about past depression. They know I am struggling and that I am trying now but I still feel empty and feel it's impossible. 

All I feel is that I am going to let them down again and never be someone they can be proud of. 

I don't know how to live... I guess is my secret. ","1380586120"

The Cicada and Raven both have big legs that make big arcs when running, which makes them quite easy to hit. It's a general problem with reverse-jointed 'Mechs.

The other lights run (sorta) like humans, but the Jenner's legs are slightly bulkier and move more, especially when they turn, so they're easier to catch with lasers. Spiders have little little legs that turn in a tight radius, close to their body, so they're harder to hit. It's probably easiest to leg a Spider while they're in the air.

Having a low sens can really help. I currently run about 30cm/360, but it depends on what you feel comfortable with.

How to headshot:

    See target

    Position mouse vaguely near targets head (OR if predicting, where targets head will be); y axis (up/down) more important to be accurate than x (across) axis

    Scope in

    Fine adjust aim by strafing and gently moving mouse; if tracking a moving target, follow movement of target

    Click head

Know when to bodyshot.

GOOD: If you have a full charge already because you're expecting someone to come around the corner but a Scout appears in the distance, use the full charge to take him out.

GOOD: If you're against a Soldier (or any class with &gt;150 health), and you think he's on full health, headshot him and follow up with a quick unscoped shot to take him down (assuming random damage spread isn't on/doesn't hates you).

GOOD: If there's something coming at you and you don't feel confident enough to quickscope them (e.g W+M1 Pyro coming at you), try to hit successive noscopes while running away - four will ideally finish off every class but Heavy. Remember that holding left/right while also holding back will make you run faster than just holding back.

GOOD: Just shoot them if you know they're under 50hp.

BAD: Hardscoping with the intention of getting bodyshots.

BAD: Hardscoping when you're in a zone where there are few teammates around/lots of enemies/your safety is not guaranteed.

Minimise time scoped in so you can see what's around you.

In close quarter combat, try to jump around versus projectile classes and Scouts; the aim is to get their shots to blow you away, allowing you to surf away from the enemy so you can run away/get into a better position. Don't jump versus Spies or Snipers, because jumping gives you a really, really predictable arc which a two year old could follow, and a really obvious landing spot. Instead, try to strafe randomly and crouch randomly for random periods of time while either trying to quickscope or unscope shoot them.

Tracking is way, way more important than flick shots, so work on that more. A lot of people like to play Osu!, which apparently helps with tracking.

Basically, big emphasis on consistency. I don't play Highlander so I can't really help you with the nuances of that :(

There are tons of super-shitty hotels that will pull that kind of stuff ([a prime example] (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sandyland-reef-inn-carpinteria)) but most hotels have a sense of pride and a desire to not get that kind of reputation.

There is a reason most hotel desk staff despise online travel agencies.  They will lie to customers, promise whatever it takes to make the reservation and then they're done.  We've had numerous guests told they could get some sort of extra service at no charge... often ones we were not physically able to provide.  One in particular (reservationcounter.com) will try to make it sound like you have reached the hotel directly.

Also, most of the agencies are owned by one of three different organizations.  Expedia owns or runs Hotels.com as  well as hotwire.com (read their wikipedia entry to see some rather accurate criticisms) and Priceline owns or runs booking.com as well as kayak.com.

about NAZIS.. yes fear of death kept people as part of the party..because they magically came to power overnight? no, it was exactly the moderate roots which led to the extremes step by step getting worse

&gt;As for the KKK well they were clearly a tool used by the slave owners to keep the blacks living in fear and to stop them rebelling.

and? that doesnt explain how such a great % of the population became part of the organization (cough moderation), how the moderates covered up for the extreme ones for so long, or how when the moderates left the extremists lost power; those are the issues at hand- the things that show the moderates are the enablers

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I don't have my old developmental psychology textbook handy- but I think you're vastly underestimating the learning processes of ancient humans. 

Small children are often described as amateur scientists, as they try things and observe the consequences, and then either repeat them (if desirable consequences) or stop doing them (if undesirable consequences) this process is known as reinforcement, which is a type of learning. 

Much of this happens at the unconscious level, and animals all have the capacity to learn as well. They've done studies with birds and rats where if they press certain buttons on machines food comes out, and other buttons have undesirable consequences. These animals are effectively drawing out correlations between certain actions and consequences (operant condition) and then acting in a way that is consistent with the good consequences. 

On my iPhone so I don't have a great deal of research at my fingertips, but humans are much more sophisticated learners, and can draw out much more subtle correlations. I think there was one study where people pressed one of two buttons, one one of two results would happen. It was something like button one have you green 55 percent of the time and red 45 percent of the time, and button two did the opposite. Within a fairly brief period of time, most people learned which button does which. Now imagine if you had a society where people could communicate, and suddenly a perceptive guy said 'this pork is sometimes making me sick' and suddenly everyone else realized the same thing (with confirmation bias playing a role). 

It would be pretty easy for a social taboo or preference to spring up- and then when some religious leader was making decisions, he would codify such taboos as rules. 

Now I don't doubt that it was partially to distinguish from other communities- but I think you're discounting humans natural capacity to pick up on correlations. The Jews happened to codify and be more strict about their taboos, and as a result often had better hygiene compared with their gentile neighbours.

Sleep device questionnaire:

1.	What kind of smart phone or sleep tracking device do you have?

2.	If you have an iPhone, you will need to buy Sleep Cycle for $2. If you have Android, you will need to get SleepBot (free). Is this OK with you?

3.	Are you willing to put a smartphone on your bed for 4 weeks to collect sleep data?

4.	On average, how long does it take you to fall asleep?

5.	Are you in the continental US?

6.	Do you promise to give me 2 weeks of sleep data using the device after it arrives?

Please fill out the pre-study survey immediately. The survey can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vfyZjR85g4QUQziieZV8J7afhcvvR8Ub3QW4ehlLm6o/edit?usp=sharing).

When you have filled out the survey, you can either save your own copy to google drive (by going to File…Make a Copy) and share it with me (jerwilsleepstudy@gmail.com) as a google doc, or just save it as a .docx file and attach it to me in an email. Send me your completed survey ASAP to get a slot in the study. I'll then send you instructions on collecting sleep data.

They included communications from 1st Cavalry Division commander Gay and a top division officer to consider refugees ""fair game""[46] and to ""shoot all refugees coming across river"".[47] In addition, interview transcripts obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests showed that the Army had not reported repeated testimony from ex-soldiers that, as one put it, ""The word I heard was 'Kill everybody from 6 to 60.'""[26]:86

With that said, I still think there should be a VIP package, or an all guns package to start off with. Cosmetics shouldn't be the ONLY thing, but they should be the main focus after the initial 3 months at launch. 

Gun progression, like we have seen with tribes, eventually dies. People earn most of their items through XP and stop spending. You can't create infinite guns either and not screw up balance horribly along the way. 

Hats though? Hats last forever and if they are an investment that people can trade people can justify spending money on something they can't simply earn like guns. 

So I think cosmetics should be the number 1 thing that drives GA revenue in the long run, but yeah, there still should be launch packages. I would actually like to see more extensive ones than the $30 standard VIP thing. 

$50 packages with exclusive tradeable helms. 

$100 Collector package with behind the scenes stuff, better exclusive in-game exclusives and maybe something shipped?  (mousepads signed by Doobie?)

I agree with you, I will say though it is fun to watch people argue over polys and such. In reality a lot of the ways people think about graphics anymore are outdated in the sense that they don't make near the difference they once did. This is why we hear developers talking about things like tessellation, sub surface scattering, etc. Because it isn't just about resolution and polys anymore and often some of the less widely known aspects of graphics can make a larger visual impact. This goes towards what you're saying with the more ""natural look"". When you can get things like light, wind, color, and physics to all react in a way you would subconsciously expect than they can feel all the more natural even when they aren't made to look real.

* With pure Cleric's--armor, weapons, and trinkets--aren't you at very, very low vitality? This, along with the power boost, was my reason for choosing head, chest, and legs with Soldier's stats. I haven't decided on trinkets yet, but I'm leaning towards more defensive stats there, too.

* Do you find that having to spam VOJ detracts from your overall playing? Seems like you'd have to have a finger on VOJ at all times while in a zerg, which is why I avoided the 15 in Radiance. Doesn't seem an appealing playstyle.

* Also worth mentioning in your build: With staff up and those boon runes, you have permanent swiftness.

* Did not realize that Whirling Wrath in a light field removes conditions--thanks for the heads up on this!

* Do you really prefer Tome of Courage as an elite over Focused Renewal? I find the 3-second invulnerability is a lifesaver, not to mention the extra heal from the refreshed virtue.

* How often are you using mace/shield? I've been using GS/staff, then switching staff to hammer right before entering combat.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","Unless there's an owner in your league who was *pissed* during the draft when you nabbed Wilson two spots ahead of him, I would hang on to him. Can the Giants really be this bad all season? I don't think so. RB's gain most of their points when their team is ahead, and the Giants aren't gonna finish 0-16.

I saw a tweet today that he's in the top-10 for all RB's in PFF's advanced 'elusive' stat. I'm sure it's imperfect, but he's making guys miss. 

My feeling is that he's one **big** run away from regaining his confidence and going back to being a beast the way he was running late last year. 

I came into the season thinking he was top-10, even prior to the Brown injury. Yes, I was probably disillusioned, but I still have faith that he's one of the most talented backs in the entire league. His o-line has been playing terribly, and if you've had the privilege (or.. curse) of being able to watch any of their games this year, you can tell it's not necessarily *his* fault that he's performed so poorly in fantasy leagues this season.

**TL;DR:** If you can get a player like Pierre Garcon or Torrey Smith, I'd probably pull the trigger (especially if you're hurting at WR), but otherwise I'd hold tight and hope he pays dividends in the fantasy playoffs like he did in 2012.

So let's say I'm a guy dating a former stripper. People saw my girlfriend naked before and people have seen me naked before. But nobody is going to be wanking to videos of my nude girlfriend while we're in a relationship. That isn't the case with porn. Porn becomes permanently available, so even if she isn't doing porn anymore, the videos are still there and that weird she's-being-wanked-to thing is still there. 

Another difference is that watching porn vs. being in [a lot of] porn means that the actors are sexually touching others while the viewer is only viewing. 

I would compare the ""I wouldn't date someone who ever stripped but I go to strip clubs "" mindset to someone who buys weed from a dealer but would never date someone who has sold weed in the past. ","1380586149"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","The  Italians  had  a  colony  in  Lybia,   and  Mussoleni  thought  it  was  a  good  place  to  launch  an  attack  on  Egypt.  He  could  cut  the  Suez  canal  and  be  much  closer  to  the  oil  fields  in  Iraq  and  Iran.  At  the  time,  the  Italians  were  not  pumping  oil  in  Lybia  and  Saudi  Arabia  was  only  producing  small  amounts  of  oil.  The  real  prizes  were  in  Mosoul  and  along  the  shores  of  the  Persian  Gulf.     
      The  Italian  general,  Marshal  Grazzianni,  was  reluctant  to  launch  an  attack  on  Egypt.  His  army  was  larger,  but  it  was  predominantly  an  Infantry  army  with  limited  transportation  assets  and  tanks.  He  sent  the  bulk  of  his  ten  divisions  into  Egypt  after  after  several  weeks  of  prodding,  but  they  stopped  after  advancing  just  seventy  miles.  They  dug  in  and  got  totaly  out  maneuvered  by  the  British  General  O'Connor's  Western  Desert  Force.  This  consisted  of  the  Seventh  Armoured  division  and  the  Fourth  Indian  infantry  division.  They  captured  so  many  troops,  one  of  the  radio  messages  they  sent  back  to  the  theater  commander,  Archbad  Wavel,  could  only  estimate  their  numbers  as  7  acres  of  officers  and  100  acres  of  enlisted  men.  The  Fourth  Indian  division  was  replaced  with  the  Sixth  Australian  Infantry  division,   which  was  a  larger  and  more  mobile  formation.  Along  with  the  Seventh  Armoured  division,  they  proceded  to  push  the  Italians  out  of  Cyrennia  and  occupied  the  Eastern  half  of  Lybia.  Wavel  had  to  send  some  of  these  victorious  troops  to  Greece,  and  had  to  deploy  inexperienced  troops  in  central  Lybia.  In  early  1941,  they  were  mauled  by  the  German  Afrika  Korps,  led  by  Erwin  Rommel.  He  was  sent  to  bail  out  the  Italians,  but  was  never  givien  an  order  to  attack  into  Egypt  or  the  forces  needed  to  successfully  achieve  that  goal.  For  the  next  twenty  months,  he  fought  the  British  with  mixed  results,  but  he  could  not  penetrate  the  British  lines  at  El  Alamein.  This  was  where  the  salt  marsh  known  as  the  Quattra  Depression  constricted  the  Egyptian  Western  desert  to  a  fairly  narrow  seventy  mile  wide  corrider.      
      General  Montgommery  was  able  to  build  up  a  large  and  over whelming  force  and  push  the  Axis  out  of  Egypt.  They  chose  to  build  up  their  Eigth  Army,  because  it  was  the  only  place  where  the  British  army  was  in  contact  with  the  Axis  forces.  The  Brits  had  been  kicked  out  of  Norway,  France  and  Greece.  They  were  not  ready  to  invade  the  continent  in  1942,  so  Egypt  was  the  only  place  the  UK  could  fight  the  axis  on  land,  and  sent  a  large  part  of  their  tank  strength  to  Egypt  in  1941  and  1942.

The last few times i had watched him we had some power struggles, but this day he was being really good and I decided he could have some of the other neighborhood kids over to play. These kids were batshit crazy and I hated them, but I decided to put up with them as a reward for my kid not fighting me on all the rules. I left them alone playing with legos while I cleaned up the dishes from dinner. One of the other boys walks into the kitchen doing a crazy pee pee dance, insisting that he needs my help going to the bathroom. I thought it was weird because he was 5 or 6 and should have been able to go on his own, but I say fuck it and walk him to the bathroom. He then excitedly shouts ""Look what I can do!"", pulls off his clothes, and proceeds to spray the entire bathroom with piss, acting like a fireman trying to put out a fire with his tiny hose. Not even a single drop makes it into the toilet. I calmly tell all the kids they have to go home, pop a movie in for my kid to keep him occupied, go into the other room an burst into tears on the phone with my mom as I explain what happened and ask for her to come over to help me clean it all up before the parents got home.

By the time she escaped the clutches of that rundown, dingy shack of a bar it was late and the rain had started to fall. She didn't mind the rain so much, she liked the way the cool beads ran down her face and hung off her nose for just an instant before they fell silently to the ground. She liked the way it plastered her hair to her face and the way it stained her blond blocks a dirty brown. Most of all she liked the way the occasional stray drop would find its way through her hair and down the back of her neck, tracing its way along her spine until she shivered. 

She liked the smell of rain, she always had done for as long as she could remember. She felt safe in the rain, it reminded her of childhood walks to and from school with her father- her hand safe in his. It's why last night when the strange man with the black hair hanging like knife tips infront of his deep green eyes took her hand in his she trusted him, though she had only known him a few hours.

As she turned the corner and saw the concrete tombstone of her apartment block looming above her in the grey night sky she felt a sadness rush over her, she knew who would be waiting for her on her bed when she pushed open the peeling door to her home. No, not her home- her house, her apartment. She found herself pausing at the rusting red gates, her hand caressed the cold steel code lock and she froze. A tear welled up, threatened to break free whilst she choked back a sob. No, this was no time for fear- for one night she had been happy, she had been safe again. Cling to that, hold your head high- it'll be better by morning, even the bruises won't remember by morning.

So she plucked at the lock like a pianist and twisted the dial, she heard the lock tumble and click and the door creaked inwards on hinges too old for the job. Her footsteps echoed in here, the rain a little more distant behind the complex walls. Moonlight cast a slim silhouette across the cheap checkered tiles of the entrance hall and she picked her way to the staircase, nobody used the elevator at this time. Nobody except that man with the green eyes and the black hair.

Six flights she climbed, her hands trembling on the wooden palisade every step of the way. She stumbled on a loose tile, but kept her composure and footing- he didn't like it when he found bruises he couldn't claim as his own. When she reached her floor she could hear that baby howling again, she smiled- that baby cried because it knew nothing else, precisely why she didn't cry anymore. Irony's cruel like that.

Her door was the third on the left, peeling paint and half a three marked apartment thirty seven on the sixth floor. Her keys rang like bells as she searched through her pocket, her hand clammy on the brass doorknob. Her eyes fluttered, she rested her head on the door for the briefest of moments before the lock clicked and she pushed the door open knowing he'd be waiting there, bottle in one hand ciggarette in the other.

But when the door opened, there was noone there- just the morning paper abandoned next to the morning coffee and the morning crusts of toast. Her breath caught in her throat. She slipped off her shoes, not daring to make a sound. Paced her way around the living room to the kitchen, but only the dull hum of the refrigerator greeted her- that and the baby howling. Maybe he was asleep already, that happened sometimes- those were the good nights, but he'd been gone for three days and was due back today. He always missed her when he'd been away, it wasn't like him to fall asleep on a night like this.

She hung her head, fetched herself a glass of cold water- lukewarm, the sinks were playing up again, and brushed a strand of hair out of her face. Breath rattling in a sigh she set the glass down and took off her coat, set it over the morning chair next to the morning table with the morning paper. Made her way to the bedroom, eyes wide with anticipation. 

When she stepped over the threshold into the little bedroom that overlooked the city, nobody lay between the sheets lit up by moonlight. He wasn't here, she sobbed this time- she didn't have the strength to hold it back. Held the back of her palm against her forehead whilst the other propped her up against the door frame. This was some kind of joke, she told herself- he'd be back any minute, if not tonight- then tomorrow.

But just for a moment, in a cold, dark apartment that overlooked the city with the paint peeling and the curtains hanging off the rail, Maggy let herself believe that the kind man with the green eyes and the black hair had done it all for her. He was nowhere to be seen. She hadn't even asked his name.","1380586158"

Places like Priceline and Hotwire tell you on the site to contact the hotel for confirmation of room type. What they dont tell you is we cant make any changes to those reservations- Its only a request. Book with the hotel if you can. Seriously. 
And if there arent any King bedrooms available when you book. Dont yell at the Front Desk because they arent there when you arrive. There was a reason you couldn't book one in the first place. We were sold out.
The front desk doesn't purposely try to piss you off. Its not our fault your room doesn't have toothpaste, that was a mistake by the housekeeper.

You could do the same thing with average ticket sale (for just upselling in general), put up a board of everyone's averages each week to see who does the best.

10mol C x (3mol F/2mol C) = 15mol F

16mol D x (3mol F/4mol D) = 12mol F

You can't make 15 moles of F if there's only enough D to make 12 moles of it.  Since there is enough C to make 3 extra moles of F, you can then convert that amount of F back into C:

3mol F x (2mol C/3mol F) = 2mol C leftover.","1380586164"

It doesn't take balls to be a bully. Corruption is the easy way out. It's the path of least resistance, as far the the 1% are concerned. It takes balls to legalize gay marriage. It takes balls to acknowledge social issues and create safe injection sites. It takes balls not to fill our jails with harmless pot smokers just to fill a quota and appease some private mogul.

It is, and always has been, a false dichotomy to suggest that the dilemma facing us today (or the dilemma facing us in 2009) is a binary choice between Obamacare and what we had in 2008.  

What I think you mean is that Obamacare's unpopularity includes those who think ""it didn't go far enough"", e.g. a voter who doesn't like Obamacare because they wanted Single-Payer.  That's true enough, but it wouldn't explain why the plurality [trust the GOP more than the Dems on Health Care](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/trust_on_issues) currently.

While I have no doubt that the GOP strategy is to repeal Obamacare, I likewise think it's incorrect to assume that the GOP strategy is to repeal Obamacare and be done with it.  Just last week, the GOP released [a comprehensive vision of Health Care reform](http://rsc.scalise.house.gov/solutions/rsc-betterway.htm) (about 5 years too late, but whatever).   Health Care reform is sorely needed, I think everyone agrees with that.  The question is whether that reform should be Obamacare going forward in perpetuity.","1380586168"

&gt; In the US, their scope of practice varies by state, based on inconsistent views of chiropractic care: some states, such as Iowa, broadly allow treatment of ""human ailments""; some, such as Delaware, use vague concepts such as **""transition of nerve energy""** to define scope of practice; others, such as New Jersey, specify a **severely narrowed scope.**[47]
US states also differ over whether chiropractors may conduct laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures, **dispense dietary supplements**, or use other therapies such as **homeopathy and acupuncture**; in Oregon they can become certified to perform minor surgery and to **deliver children via natural childbirth.**[44] A 2003 survey of North American chiropractors found that a slight majority favored allowing them to write prescriptions for over-the-counter drugs.[29]

  
(1) The idea that chiropractors practice to the maximum extent of their allowed scope is arbitrary and deeply troubling.
  
(2) Chiropractors delivering children is a horrible idea. My relative insisted on doing this for his wife and he fucked it up and had to take the baby to the hospital for real care.
  
(3)  2003 survey of North American chiropractors found that a slight majority favored allowing them to write prescriptions for over-the-counter drugs.[29] (Prescriptions for *over-the-counter* drugs? Wat.)

Sorry man, but this shit is quackery. Nonetheless, if you are a chiropractor or have some stake in the game, there's still plenty of money to be made for the foreseeable future.

"Louisiana","t5_2qr93","That's a shit situation. A lot of insurance agencies in LA are predatory in nature. Unbelievably high deductibles and premiums with little to no coverage for most things. Obamacare, will attempting to make a more fair and generous market, will obviously encourage companies like this to remain in business for a few more years after it kicks in but before regulatory agencies ever get around to busting up their practices. 

It sounds like your husband's employer is in league with such an agency and you are about to get screwed over by Obamacare because of it. 

While I don't have any good suggestions on care providers I do suggest that you talk to a personal accountant and figure out the logistics for a Healthcare Savings Account. These are savings accounts that take a portion of your check each month before taxes. You can determine how much you want to put away each month and combine that with the premium you'll pay before taxes are taken out of your paycheck. I'd suggest taking about $700 per month out of your paychecks to save for healthcare. Make sure the HSA rolls over year to year. You'll typically have a lower savings rate on the money but it will be tax free money you can use on any number of healthcare things. After 5 years or so you should have your entire deductible covered by just the extra you don't spend on it from each years savings. 

Some insurance agencies provide them but I don't trust that shit cause a lot of times the rider is that at the end of the fiscal year, that money gets pocketed by the insurer which is unfair. 

Also the Marketplace is going into place tomorrow but LA is one of the few states that neither set up a marketplace or took federal money to help with insurance. Basically allowing Health Insurance Companies in LA to operate outside the federal restrictions inside the state of Louisiana. Again screwing you over. It's shitty either way you look at it.

To begin with, slavery is not even on the same level as meat eating - one involves human suffering - and like I have constantly irreterated - a cow does NOT have the same value as a human to our society.

""So, if you could rape or kill someone you hate, you would do so if society was okay with it and it wasn't against the law or you wouldn't get caught? If you wouldn't do so, why wouldn't you?""

If, if, if... It IS against society however. And because of this, it is amoral. 

""True, but it's also easier for people to beat their kids if they don't listen, rather than trying to teach their kids lessons through talking and using other forms of discipline. Doesn't mean it's acceptable to beat your kids.""

That begs again that meat-eating is NOT acceptable in society, which it is.  It is NOT acceptable to beat your kids.

""Plus, there are many world-class athletes and some weight-lifting record holders who are vegan, showing it's not 100% necessary for everyone to eat meat in order to build muscle.""

"photography","t5_2qh2a","&gt; What makes Peiling’s images so mesmerising is the soft focus, vibrant colours and specular bokeh, created by nothing more than backlit sheets of coloured plastic, a wide aperture and a dusting with a water spray. “I mainly use f/2.8 to get the bokeh, but it can make focusing tricky; especially if a subject moves. It’s not so much of a problem with a praying mantis, but as ants are a lot faster I have to find a balance between depth-of-field, soft light and a fast enough shutter speed to freeze the movement. The background is usually colourful sheets of plastic that I have found in stationery stores matching the material I collect from my garden. I place it about two feet behind the subject, backlit by a table lamp, then position a Nissin flashgun with softbox to my left, pointing 45° at the camera. Once the actor or actress is settled, I spray the water and fire the flash. As long as the flash is at the right angle and the timing is spot on for freezing droplets as they fall, you’ll get beautiful bokeh.

&gt;“When using flash, I set it to manual and the lowest power, but even then it’s often too strong. To help diffuse both the Nissin and integral flash, I layer material to cut down the light: paper, cotton, white plastic bags – anything to make the light softer. I also angle myself differently depending on the subject. For instance, as ants are small, I angle the camera upwards to make them look larger. Whereas a praying mantis is shot from eye level for better eye contact.”

&gt;After returning her subjects to where they came from, Peiling goes about processing her Raw files, but even this only consists of minor adjustments to the brightness. White Balance and colour in Photoshop.

ACA expands and organizes the marketplace for consumers so that private companies are responsible for the insurance coverage. It basically shifts the costs from the government to the marketplace. People are always talking about reducing our federal expenditures and reigning in the debt, but when a piece of legislation comes forward to insure millions of Americans and help reduce our deficit they tend to back away.

In particular, I think I'd be fine with その for something *you* just told *me* about, as much as for things I mentioned, and use あの either when I'm already using その, or when I'm talking about a guy we spoke of in a previous conversation or conversation topic. However, I think I'd only use この for things I'm talking about.

Also, あの人 is not wrong: if I wanted to say ""that guy (that we were laughing at yesterday) is on the porch"", I'd totally use あの. Just, given lack of context, その comes to my mind sooner.","1380586193"

If they stopped their enrichment development at a certain point and held it there for more than a year, then it's very easy to be ""a year away"" from having the ability to make one for a very long time.","1380586193"

"aikido","t5_2qhwn","I'm not gonna say this is awesome because I say that every time.

I will, however, draw people's attention to [Ellis Amdur's impressions](http://www.aikiweb.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20847) of Tada sensei that you mention briefly in your blog entry.  It really is quite the read if you're interested in Tada or the benefits of good solo training.

As someone who is currently ""flying solo,"" as it were, I found a lot here useful and very inspirational.  We all *say* that in aikido we forge our own paths (like quotes such as ""if there are 10 different people naturally there will be 10 different aikidos""), but that really doesn't seem to be the reality of it, at least not with what I see most of the time.  What I see is usually a very unique and talented teacher with a cadre (large or small) who end up, more or less, looking like him/her externally but lacking what their teacher was *actually* doing in his conceptual understanding of budo.

So that is one reason I found it worth looking into and would suggest folks also read Amdur's (a great historian and budoka in his own right, and no pushover) words, too.

I particularly liked this quote from Amdur's article:

&gt;I've never seen this training [Tada's *ki no renma* solo training], but I believe his ability to stay absolutely centered throughout his techniques, even with someone hanging on his arm in ryote-mochi iriminage, with their feet literally off the ground, can very likely be attributed to his daily practice of these methods.","1380586194"

If I'm reading something for school or think the word might be relevant or useful, I look it up when I get a chance (usually, I note down the word and the page - if no paper is handy, I'll dog-ear the corner). If I'm reading for fun and think it's a useful or important word, I try to remember to look it up but that might not actually happen. 

I definitely tend to retain words better if I actually look them up, rather than relying on context. 

In other languages: I definitely tend to rely on context clues as well as root words/prefixes/suffixes more, as it can get ridiculous to look up every single word I haven't encountered. Often, it is pretty obvious that it's just a different form of a word I've already encountered or a compound word that I can break down and figure out. ","1380586203"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","&gt;result = result + characters[a];

""result"" is the name of the variable that is holding all the characters we are putting together.  It was initialized (started off as) the empty string.  

""result ="" this is saying that result *becomes* or gets the value that is described by the right hand side of this statement.  result was something, but now it is getting a new value.

""result + characters[a]""

this is the right hand side I was talking about.  It has a couple parts.  First is where it says ""result"" this gives us the value that ""result"" had prior to this statement.  ""+"" is the next part and here it is doing concatenation for us.  That is, it is combining a string with a character.  ""characters[a]"" means that it is getting the value in index a from the array characters.  The variable ""a"" starts at zero and gets bigger by one every time the loop executes.  The ""characters"" is that array of characters that our function was given as an argument.

Lets walk through it like this.  Say we call that function I wrote with this character array {'b','c','d','e'}

result = """";

Result is the empty string

for(int a = 0; a &lt; characters.length; a ++)

a begins at 0.  While a is less than the length of the array, in this case 4, the loop will keep executing.  Every time it does, a will increase by 1.

result = result + characters[a]

This is the first execution of our loop.  a is zero.  result is """".  result becomes the current value of result """" combined with the value in the zero index of the array characters, which is {**'b'**,'c','d','e'}

result becomes or gets the value of """" + 'b' which is ""b"".

The loop ends. It performs the check ""Do I keep going?"" and to answer this we say ""Is a &lt; characters.length?""  Well, a is zero and characters.length is 4, so yes.  a gets bigger by 1.  The loop repeats.

result = result + characters[a];

result is ""b"".

result becomes ""b"" + characters[a];

a is equal to 1 now.  characters[a] is {'b',**'c'**,'d','e'}

result becomes ""b"" + 'c'

result is now equal to ""bc"".

The loop ends...

The Cardassian's have just given up a base where there is not going to be routine supply drops, it will be fly by the seat of your pants medicine. Bashir wants to challenge himself (or more likely doesn't want the attention of a super high profile position due to his genetic past).

3. I'm not what you're asking.

4. This map is post-Khitomer Accords. The Federation and Star Fleet are first and foremost explorers. After the signing of the Khitomer treaty the Federation moved beyond the Klingon Empire. The Klingons allow this because they can benefit from the exploration of the Federation by having the Federation do the boring mapping and contact and opening relations.  
The Klingons allow the non-contiguous territory because the Federation is not a strict military threat at the time, and this provides a buffer from the Romulan Star Empire for their flank. The Klingons know that in the event of war with the Romulans (a likely scenario) they will have likely allies in the Federation or if the UFP stays out of the fight, then the Romulans can't cross Federation space at will (or at least risk discovery by the Federation).

I don't bother practicing my slapshot standing still now. There are a couple things I do. Shoot it off the boards and settle the rebound quickly and get a shot off. Skate backwards with the puck as far as my reach allows, then pull it in tight and rip a ""mini timer"" (patent pending). Or come barreling over the blue line and tee one up at full speed. My slapshots are getting a lot better now. 

I definitely find that my shots get worse immediately after a shooting pad session too. I'm working on strength and technique which is good, but I lose the muscle memory of shooting a wrister coming at the net with speed

"realmadrid","t5_2rr0e","It isn't even that it is obsolete as formations can adapt. The biggest problem I see is that it isn't pure. 

A lot of people know formation via FIFA or google searches but if you have experience playing within the confines of one you'll realize the importance of having fluidity and structure. Carlo's 442 plays like a 433. You see Isco rotate to the naval, you see Benz hold the mid (and poorly) and Cris going back to the wing. The problem? Cris and Benz become isolated which leads to a double/triple pressed Cristiano and a lone Benzema playing as a lone striker... something that doesn't fit his profile. 


A formation needs to bring about the best from your players. I can accept Ozil being the sacrifice as he had no spot in it, but forcing 4,5 players to adapt? Oh man, this is going to be a long season. Regardless, I'm supporting it.","1380586221"

It was when he was in rehab describing the wood working class he took back in high school.  He was talking about how he started something and finished it really quickly but the final product was pretty terrible.  His teacher asked him if he could do better or if that was really all he had.

I think, for Jesse, it was the one time that he did something for himself and what he did was so good that he actually surprised himself.  He was actually proud of HIMSELF.  Throughout the entire show I think Jesse struggled with acceptance and struggled to impress others.  He acted like a huge meth dealer at the beginning with Chili P, struggled to impress his parents, then struggled to impress Walter.

I think at that moment of depravity, he was just thinking of something that HE was proud of.  I think you're right OP- it definitely was one of the hardest hitting scenes of the series for me for sure.  I'm so glad he got out.","1380586221"

When you craft a synthetic pathway from scratch, mutations can potentially deactivate your built-in logic circuits (and/or/etc. promoter gates) and completely ruin the pathway. We build our pathways from the ground up so letting nature take its course can not improve it.

In the past, that has been a strategy that's been used, using forced mutations and a selective agent of some kind. But in the work I do, where we're developing super efficient proteins and crafting metabolic pathways from scratch, that's barbaric.","1380586222"

And as an educator, that's a trip to the office - not a slap on the wrist apology.  

Also when you talk to administration you may want to go the route of the Tinker Test. Basically free speech stops in the classroom when it substantially disrupts the learning environment, which sounds like you might be at.

You are the one who is coming across as as smug and pretentious here. You've already ascertained how nuanced my view is from a couple of sentences?

You conveniently ignore the systematic, endemic child abuse. Perpetrated by many members of the church, and covered up by many, many more. Sickening.

Here's another one, the churches backwards stance on contraception has no doubt caused massive, widespread suffering through the spread of disease.

And how can you, with a straight face, claim that the church hasn't been responsible for holding back scientific advancement? 

I'm not an atheist by the way, certainly not subscribed to that sub. I very rarely post about religion, if ever. I was merely pointing out that your claim of 'massive social justice' was an arguable one, which it undoubtedly is.

It's a shame people see the 421 pass yards and assume he had a solid night, but that is hardly the case. He missed several throws and needed to have been more accurate.

This season feels like it is going to flames. Luckily, 2 of our losses are against AFC opponents and we could run the table to slip into a wildcard spot (we will compete with Sea/SF, Chi/GB).

You can *give* other players items of rarity 3 or lower, so just potions and the like.

&gt;Is there no way to grow carpenter bugs? I've got my farm pretty far along, but it won't let me grow them.

Nope, you can't grow material bugs, only combination bugs. Welcome to the Tried farm, the PSP farms were better.

&gt;I'm constantly running out of resources and having to go on 'free-hunts' for more. Should I be selling more stuff to Junior?

Converting teams is the best way to get resource points. As you progress you'll be able to trade better items. One of the DLCs is a one time 5000 points.

&gt;Does my record matter? Deaths and quest fails?

You get titles for some milestones. Some people say your number of failed quests affects how well you'll do as a hunter for hire for other people, but I'm unconvinced.

&gt;Is there any free DLC? For instance there are some 'extra's but it just says push x to download them ALL. Do I want to do this?

All of the DLC in MH is free. There are event quests, challenge quests and extras. You want it all.

&gt;Is the game basically the same on the DS? Do I have to have a 3DS to play it?

MH3U is a 3DS game, it won't work on an old DS. If you meant the WiiU, its exactly the same, just with online play added and slightly better graphics.

&gt;Is there anyway to go out on dates with the guild girl? What if I'm really really good looking?

I think the game you're looking for is Dragon Age

&gt;I've killed Barroth and about to head to the Tundra, so I'm not a rookie

Not to mention how there are very, very few grocery stores in poorer areas.

Take some sort of action -- even if you are incorrect/doing stupid shit you will learn from it.

I'm 18 and I wasn't getting very far by thinking/planning out ideas.

I'm a freshmen in college this year (effectively a full time student), and my business is essentially internet marketing + [blogging about my internet marketing](http://pagerankworld.com) (which is essentially my way of doubling down on my marketing, by marketing the knowledge I gain from my successes).

Don't risk money until you know what you are doing. (I lost $X,XXX from being an idiot and trying to invest my money is terrible business ideas)... but absolutely try and start a business or do something.

You might not feel like you are learning anything or accomplishing anything, but give it a year or two and you will be amazed at what you have accomplished.

I went from starting with 0 starting capital, to making about $2,000 in profit my senior year of high school, to then making over $1,000/month now.

And I still feel like I haven't made much progress... but the reality is that if you look back to two years ago when I started, I have made huge advances in experience/success.","1380586240"

I just found out that I have a FLGS at the corner of my street.  Naturally I had to investigate and get a game.

* **Risk Legacy**
I will not spoil anything but we've played four games so far and all have been quite a bit of fun.  The first game (4 people) took about 2.5 hours mostly due to explaining rules, getting used to things, and one person had never played risk before.  Once we got into the swing of things the time dropped drastically and I know one game took less than 45 minutes.  A definite improvement over regular risk, and I think this is going to be hitting the table pretty often.

* **Twilight Struggle** Some of the other players were unavailable later in the weekend and so I broke out my best two player game.  This was the first time for the other player.  We played a learning game, and then another real one after that.  He picked it up pretty quickly and enjoyed it.  I need to look to see if there is some sort of handicapping system for new players, I haven't played it a ton so I don't have a good handle on how much leeway to give them.

**Discussion**

A large majority were just based off seeing them in the store and reading BGG.  I've bought a few at Origins over the years, and that has yet to let me down. My most recent of these was **Quicksilver** and that has been a huge hit.  There have been a few that I have played beforehand but I have yet to get really burned by a game I haven't tested before I played.

My gateway game was **Power Grid**.  I was at a FLGS and some guys had a game going and invited me to play.  I was hooked, I loved it and I bought the game that day.","1380586254"

Her whole family was present: sisters, brothers, father and mother, and yet they could do nothing as this little girl burned.

She was just a few years older than those schoolgirls in that picture, and her father (my Uncle) became an alcoholic for over a decade after.

When I was younger, my brothers and I would make fun of him as: ""that drunk Uncle"", but it wasn't until I was much older that I appreciated what caused him to move down that route.  When he did drink, he was always able to control himself -- as in, not cuss -- when in the presence of my younger sisters.  I'm almost certain they reminded him of his lost daughter, in fact, the older of my two sisters was born the same year my cousin died, so she was named in remembrance of her cousin.

I've noticed that most of the time, when somebody is an utter asshole for no apparent reason it is because of their weird baggage.  Case in point: I worked with a horrible loudmouthed Bostonian who would only communicate with me in veiled insults.  I didn't want to start anything at work, so I just laughed at her whenever she tried to talk to me.  She avoided me (thank you) assiduously after that.   It turns out she was in an abusive marriage with an unfaithful husband, was about to lose her house and actually was jealous of me for various stupid reasons (believe me, not bragging here - I thought she was completely delusional....although my life probably looked pretty sweet since I was not married to a crack head).  

If it's bureaucracy, or something other than another person that is frustrating me, I usually try to figure out something I can do to fix things.  I will give myself a limited amount of time to complain/bitch to everyone/write letters.  If I can't fix it with reasonable effort then I walk away.

You're right, though, I'm all for rapists being denied child custody.  Right from the start; if the child is a result of rape, rapists wanting to get custody should be dismissed with prejudice from day one.  I'm even for rapists being forced to have an abortion should they get pregnant or else forced to go into adoption, whatever is most reflective of the victim's personal views.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Agreed, Green really doesn't have many ways to push through damage, and that hurts them a lot in a set that doesn't really support swarm tactics for green.

As for red, I see that, and my addendum is that Red also has access to a surprisingly strong creature base, with the Red Emissary giving red more evasion than it's traditionally had and shit like that 4 mana cyclops that allow them to transition to the late game much better than they traditionally can, meaning they can unload their burn spells at much more strategic times than normal, since mid-range removal isn't nearly so much of a priority. I actually found that having midrange creatures to drop really lets Red use its burn spells at their most effective; in the early game to keep your opponent off the board, and late game as a finisher.","1380586257"

"Firearms","t5_2ryez","""you are free to limit YOUR defense options to well below a standard capacity 30 round rifle mag (of 5.56 or 7.62 for example) to a severely limited capacity 10 round mag all you want. But I will never limit myself (or my neighbors ability for that matter) to defend life and limb of yourself and your loved ones. Citizens have a natural right to access the means to best equip themselves for self defense.""

You're presenting an emotional response to an emotional argument.  ""I need X because I feel like I need it."" is not going to be a valid response to ""Why do you need X?""  Both question and answer are based in emotion.  And since these same people do NOT believe that citizens have a natural right to the same level of firearms that you do simply saying ""We have a natural right so there."" again will not move the conversation forward at all and likely not in your favor.  This is most likely why when you present those answers you get an eye roll, a sigh and some contrived response.

""And since these crazed mass murderer madmen types have a total disregard for the most severe and heinous crimes known to humankind, do you honestly, sincerely, truly believe that some totally unenforceable magazine capacity law will do ANYTHING to prevent their terrible acts?""

You MUST remember that the anti gunner is playing the long game.  Yes they DO believe that by making those laws that EVENTUALLY when there are only 10 round and smaller magazines the law will have their intended effect.  They do not care if it takes 20 years for all the high cap mags out now to break and be useless... Because then in 20 years they got their goal of absolutely no high cap mags as long as now they can stop their production and especially transfer if they can.  The long game.  Its always about the long game.

""And if you are honest with yourself and possess even a basic understanding of logic and criminality and the enforceability of law - your answer will be a resounding NO.""

You are asking someone using emotion to defend an illogical position to ""be honest with yourself""...  There are similes, analogies and metaphors dealing with pissing up or into certain things but 

tldr: that is a futile tactic.

""The only thing arbitrary magazine capacity laws accomplish is the injury and infringement of the rights of law abiding citizens.""

They will ask to see where in the 2nd amendment the right to high cap magazines is specifically promised.  A 10 round mag likely fulfills all the legal requirements to afford the ability to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the 2nd amendment.  IMO the defense of HCMs lies more in the statistical nature of their use and geographical ownership as opposed to attempting to claim them as a civil right.  At least as far as winning over the average anti gunner is concerned.  Legally speaking it would rock if access to them were classified as part of the individual civil right to keep and bear arms.","1380586258"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Read my last sentence. The hatred and bigotry of Europeans against the Romani people are the cause of their refusal to assimilate. A Romani person in Europe would probably initially have good intentions of just living a regular normal life, but because Europeans would associate him with the crimes that other Romanis have committed, he would have a disadvantage in life. He would probably get bullied in school, and as a result, would have insufficiently high grades to get into a decent university. When he goes and looks for a job, no one would hire him because he is a Romani, and many Europeans are racists. Now he has to fid somewhere to live, but no one would rent a house to him because he is being INVOLUNTARILY associated with other Romanis who just happened to be criminals. Now he has two options for a better life, he could either move to the US where he could start a new life for himself and his children without the hatred and discrimination that is present in Europe, or he could move to a Romani settlement in Europe where the people would accept them. Immigration into the US is extremely difficult, so option 2 is much more popular. So he moves into a gypsy settlement, and he is poor as fuck because he was denied equal opportunities, a life of crime would be the only logical solution at this point in his life. Why do you think Romani people assimilate in America? Why do you think we never here about Gypsy crime organizations here even though there is probably more Gypsies in the US than any individual EU country? Its because we don't perpetuate the cycle of bigotry and crime like you sick Europeans do.

Edit: Also it seems to be much more evident that you are indeed a racist. You would associate all Romani people as sub-human trash because of the actions of a few. You don't care if certain Romani people are living decent lives and assimilating, all you care about is selectively analyzing facts so you can justify your hatred of Gypsies.","1380586260"

There is huge shrink in retail, we don't all pay for it, if there was no shrink, then it'd just be more profitable, they wouldn't suddenly start shooting for lower margins and less money. And it's a fairly tale situation anyways.

That's why it's broken, that's why it will remain broken. We can't socialize, capitalism and it seems like it's going to end poorly.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Lol.  Key caveats were: ""always seemed"" and  ""rarely hear.""  I have heard studio recordings of stuff that sounds impressive, but I've really seen a DJ in public do anything other than play song after song with various transitions.  As a former musician, I can tell you that the general public for the most part cannot distinguish between mediocre music and excellent music.  I had some talent, but I was mediocre, as least with regard to improvisation.  Yet people would always tell me how great I sounded!  I guess they never listened to Stan Getz.  One time, I got up on stage and played my saxophone.  This girl I was with went absolutely nuts.  I swear to you that I blew absolute crap.  The horn was not configured to my tastes and I could barely get it to work, plus, my improv skills sucked.  But she was impressed by me being up on stage and playing with the band.  This is how it is for most DJs and musicians.  It's all smoke and mirrors to the uninitiated.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","In cognitive neuroscience, the phenomenon you are talking about would probably be classified as forgetting information stored in 'short-term' or 'active' memory.

1) Current cognitive theories on memory do in fact posit the existence of both 'short-term' and 'long-term' memory. The functional differences between the two are the amount of information able to be stored, and the extinction time (or time it takes to forget) of the memory. An often quoted statistic says that short-term memory can hold 7 +/- 2 elements of memory for a matter of seconds (assuming no rehearsal). Long-term memory on the other hand is thought to have an indefinite storage capacity and extinction time. If short-term memories are constantly rehearsed and actively maintained they can be transferred to long-term memory which is then maintained by internal brain processes. Of course these are not hard and fast rules and can vary from person to person, but you have the general idea correct.

2) Memory retrieval is more tricky, because the brain can draw on both types of memory in attempting to perform a task. If the task is to immediately repeat a string of random numbers, the brain is likely utilizing short-term memory. Whereas if you were asked what town you grew up in, you'd probably be drawing on long-term memory. In this specific example, it is hard to say which type of memory is being used, as it depends on what exactly you were trying to say. ","1380586267"

This is cannon as it appears in [Uncanny X-Men #1](http://www.angelfire.com/comics/sams-x-men-site/images/ish1.jpg) and the x-gene was not discussed till later.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Ok, paranoid gun nuts was a swipe at the Anti-Government Ruby Ridge Militia types, it certainly wasn't a characterisation of all Americans, I've known more than enough to know it isn't very common. I'm a rifle club member myself (need to get back to the range actually, I've been far too busy), and so I tend to run across these sorts of thread quite frequently, and as soon as I start hearing about the Second Amendment being used ""because we need to defend against the government"", my bullshit detector fires, and I can't take it anymore! We aren't in the 18th century any more, the technological high ground held by modern military forces is just too far out of reach, even if the Governments did get out of line. All the infantry training in the world isn't going to help against drone strokes, thermobaric weapons and the ability to jam every communications channel that civilians are going to have access to. I mean, if we're talking concentration camps (and these guys are; ""FEMA camps!!"" blah bah), we're talking Total War, not police action ""Lets spare civilians"" level stuff .I'm not sure my 30-03 would really be too effective against an F-22 with laser guided missiles. I mean, I know it's sacrilegious to say this to an American but FFS, the constitution was written in a different time, for a different age and different set of conditions. Maybe try and follow the spirit of it but stop with trying to make it some be all and end all that will be good for all time? If I wanted to defend myself against Government tyranny these days, I'd want at least a low yield nuke or two. Not gonna happen.

I think you also missed my point about the brainwashing thing as well. It's the ""Evil Fed coming ta take our guns"" types who think you're brainwashed. I worked with a couple of Americans guys a while back, one Texas, one Colorado. Nice enough guys, but damn, the crap that came out of them. My entire post was based off the rubbish I see those kinds of guys coming out with, its just insane. Or have you never had the pleasure of running across any of the Waco supporting, Timothy McVeigh loving militia types? You're really not missing out. 

As for the Iraq thing, fair enough, you're entitled to your opinion. Personally, I find it fairly black and white. Either shoot the man or don't. And if you do, don't invent ipso facto excuses to justify it afterwards. Rewriting history to try and seem like the ""good guys"" all the time, just has the opposite effect. Nobody's fooled by it.

I get irritated by this, but perhaps it's just a cultural thing. My Brother, Brother in law, Uncle, Grandfather etc are/were in the Army or Airforce and I simply find it odd, that people who claim to be patriots and ""support the troops"" on the one hand, seem so eager to find excuses to ""rise up against them"" on the other. It just seems like an exercise in dick waving to me. Less of politically aware patriots, more of people looking for an excuse to finally get an excuse to shoot at something that shoots back (but magically misses, just like the movies!).

OTOH and just to be a pain in the ass and argumentative, perhaps you're right and the US military and police won't fire on it's own people, especially unarmed civilians. History would say otherwise of course:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_Mine_massacre
etc, etc.
But I hope if it does come to that, you'll stick to your principles and refuse. Not that your orders and the propaganda around the event would be framed in such a way that you'd think you were doing the right thing.

I mean, when it comes down to it, your police are already militarised, your NSA openly admits to spying on you illegally, both political parties are already so unbelievably on the take from various corporate interests, at what point would enough be enough? Would it actually take that whole FEMA camp scenario coming about before this ""Second American Revolution"" happens? It just seems like a load of bravado with no substance. The original American Revolution happened over far fewer taxes and probably even less taxation without representation. Who would you even vote for? 

Here, maybe we're just far more cynical on this side of the pond, and don't really expect our politicians to tell us the truth to begin with. Not much incentive to revolt when there's nobody you could really replace them with. Depressing, I know. The point is, as much as our Governments love to fuck us, they'll always use just enough lube that they won't quite cross that final line and cause any kind of Civil War. They already own us as much as they need too, what would be the point in risking a mutiny of some or all of the population? And if anyone does decide to ""defend their property against the police and the fed"", as I see in threads all the friggin time by Americans discussing gun control, you know what will happen? Nothing. They'll be shot by the cops, painted in the media as terrorists or nutjobs and that'll be the end of it. Sorry. 

Fine, I know, I'm a foreigner, I just ""don't understand the American myth"", I'll go back to lurking. I apologise if I seemed rude, but the endless drivel about how some new wave of Paul Reveres is going to be rising up any minute now drives me nuts. Every time someone sees some American going off about that crap on the TV, our gun laws get a little stricter as ""Obviously, you must believe in that bullshit too if you're a shooter, so lets make it even harder to stop you nut jobs from deciding to shoot at the cops or something"".

"australia","t5_2qh8e","You might have luck with the touch football matches organised in most cities. They tend to be more relaxed and mixed sex so it's less competitive and more accepting of beginners. They also run throughout the year, but are harder to find in summer. 

It's pretty hard to play in a 'real' game of footy (proper rules, contact and intensity) unless you are part of a club. The game does not scale well so it's really only properly played in weekends in real matches. 

That being said, every town and suburb has one or more casual football club that would be happy to have you train with them and play a game or two. Football clubs tend to either take the game quite seriously, or not at all, so find one that's just in it for the laugh. The clubs I've been involved with are always happy to have foreigners in the team for the entertainment value :)

Otherwise just get people together for a kick in the park. It won't be a real game, but it might give you an idea of whether you like it or not. AFL has some unique skills and rules like the bounce, our style of punting and the handball, holding the ball, shepherding and push in the back. They take practice, so starting small is a good idea.

Major athlete, built, handsome and sweet. We spent a lot of time together, and one day rented bikes, along with two French girls we knew - to bike through the countryside to a neighboring village. Halfway there, my friend's bike developed a flat. I told the girls I'd walk back with him and they rode off without us. Since we were next to a huge field of wheat, I suggested we take our food and have a picnic. Long story short, after TONS of sexual tension, we had full on naked sex in the field, just yards from the road. It was his first time. And if you so much as touched his dick, he would come. Still, it was a fantasy. When we both got back home to college, we had sex another couple of times - but the premature ejaculation thing just made it too difficult (we were both very young, and I'd handle it differently now). Then I met his fiancee. Awkward, very, very awkward. ","1380586284"

You bring up a good point. I don't like the extent that the NSA is going to; as in, this is a LOT of data and most of it seems unimportant. You're right, though, it's **all** important until ruled otherwise.

But I look at this from a historical perspective. Namely Nazi Germany, but also many Communist countries. They all kept track of their citizens. Slowly and surely, they built a database. When it came time to take out the people they didn't like, they had the available data for it. That's where I'm coming from as far as being against such vast data collection.

On the other hand, the Boston Marathon bombers were students. To catch them would require domestic surveillance. But all this data doesn't mean prefect protection.

Part of *my* biggest issue is I don't want the NSA reading my e-mails. Very specific, but it's an invasion of privacy. I have nothing to hide: I'm a staunch small-government person who thinks government screws everything up. But this invasion of privacy, coupled with the consistent lying and law-breaking is what I won't stand for. 

My personal issue is where to draw the line. This is why I want more people to care. Because hopefully someone will come up with an idea of a line that I can stand for. Because this extent is too much for me, but *some* surveillance is necessary.

"marchingband","t5_2rmqc","I am an avid marching band enthusiast and I teach at the high school from which I graduated.  I do not, however, think that marching band is a sport.  Here's the crux of my argument: marching band is an athletic activity and a performing art.  To call it ""sport"" would be shortchanging it.  My personal definition of sport is an event where there are defined parameters for gauging score (ball crosses the endzone, runner touches home base) and marching band does not fall into that category.  It is judged by people who use a rubric of sorts to determine the skill level of the performers and the group (much like competitive cheer, another non-sport in my book).  That marching is physically demanding is not in contest.  I just think when bands go out onto that field and create an emotional journey for the audience, it transcends the scope of a sport's test of skill vs. skill.  That is where the ""art"" in performing art comes from and I wouldn't have it any other way.

tl;dr: Yes, marching band requires athletic skill. No it is not a sport because it connects at a deeper level.","1380586286"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","I have a 2005 ninja 250 that I regularly ride on the freeway.  I live in SoCal so the traffic here goes around 75-85 and I can keep up just fine, but there are a few issues that may or may not bother you:

1) It takes a bit longer to pass, so you'll have to plan out your moves ahead of time

2) I weigh about 135lbs and going 85mph means the bike is somewhere between 10 and 11k rpm.  Redline starts at 13k.  I haven't had any engine problems, but...

3) Pieces of my bike have literally unscrewed themselves or broken and popped off while I'm riding because they're vibrating so hard at speed.

I fixed this issue by replacing the front 14 tooth sprocket with a 15 tooth sprocket.  This slightly decreases your ability to accelerate, but it also drops your rpms by about 1k, so now I'm at &lt;10k rpm at 85mph.  Much more comfortable and less vibration, but now it takes even longer to pass.  Upside is that your max speed is increased, so it's totally capable of going 100+ if you really want to.

Some other stuff you might want to know:

-I get around 68mpg riding aggressively

-Your weight affects the acceleration a lot more than on a larger bike. If you take a passenger, don't expect to be able to keep up on the freeway

-I've made it up twisty mountains and canyons with no problems

-If I ride too aggressively for too long I'll end up burning some oil.  This means I have to top up my oil once in a while.  It also means I don't really have to change the oil ever, since it's being replaced constantly anyway.  I use 20w50 now instead of 10w40 and it lasts a bit longer.

-The tires are smaller than usual, so bumps and cracks are a bigger concern

-Rotor is smaller than usual, so braking takes a bit more effort, but it's also harder to lock up and/or flip

-I can keep up with larger bikes easily, but if they decide to gun it, I won't see them again until they stop

-Can open the throttle all the way without dying.  Or even doing a power wheelie for that matter

-Still faster than most cars

-It's really light and fun to ride, but you won't realize that until you get  on a larger bike","1380586291"

Just make sure they're not so skinny [that they follow every contour of your legs and asphyxiate them.](http://i.imgur.com/zoIW8IJ.jpg)

Trying different brands can't hurt. If you're still not happy with the Dockers skinny fit there's no reason not to try somewhere else. It'll be more work, but the payoff will be huge once you find the right fit.

Three Sydney premiership players retired this year (Bolton, Mattner, Morton), Jessie White has requested a trade to the Pies and with Mumford possibility moving to Hawthorn there is some money in the bank.


On top of this Tippet's contract was heavily front-loaded so that will free up a lot of cap space next year. 


That being said COLA should be looking into with the WA teams, no doubt.

I was 21 and she was a classmate. She made it clear it was a fling from the start, but I got attached. We fooled around a few times, and then one night we had the most awkward and worst sex of my life. Neither of us came, despite about an hour of sexing. She felt guilty because she felt she was cheating on a bf back home (thought they were officially on a break), and I felt bad that she felt guilty.

I spent about a year or so thinking about her while she went about her life. A couple years later she invited me to her birthday party out of the blue essentially as her sure thing for the night, I think. A friend of hers cock-blocked us though. A couple weeks after that we had arranged to get together in the evening. I ended up crashing at a friend's house, and when I woke up I got a call from her. My friend shouted something from the bathroom, and I could hear it through the phone... she had been fucking my friend's roommate not 20 feet from me. I drank a lot that day...

For young footballers with lots of money, Sydney is far more attractive than a backwater like Adelaide. Considering how much footy talent SA produces I think it would almost be fair to give us a salary cap boost to help retain players who are drawn to the east coast. Plus things like utilities in SA are the most expensive in the nation. And while the cost of living is lower in SA, the average pay is much lower than what people are paid in NSW. Different cities have different advantages and disadvantages so I don't think it is fair that 1 state gets a financial advantage over the others when many other important issues are not factored in by the AFL that hurt the smaller states.

"OneY","t5_2s5ni","From the article:

&gt;I think that what I worry about are boys getting very visible examples that show men dominating women, and it’s presented in a way that it’s not for the benefit and the enjoyment and the respect of both people.


From my perspective, so many people get the ""porn thing"" wrong. I understand that she, Rosaline Wiseman, is trying to understand where the boys are coming from, but it seems she is doing so through a feminist lens. 

First of all she talks about male hierarchy. This implies that there are few or one with power at the top and many lower status males beneath them. From what I have seen in my life, few males are actually dominate. Many boys today not only have few dominate traits, but we also have a culture that actively encourages them to not exercise dominance (as she has kind of alluded to herself). 

Basically I am saying that the porn she is talking about is a small sliver of the vast expression of sexuality and sexual fantasy that we witness in porn. She does not realize that many men in the hierarchy are submissive and do not want to be dominant. She seems to ignore that fact that some women (probably most heterosexual women) want a dominate male as a sexual partner. She seems to be unaware that maturing boys sometime experiment sexually with other boys and are either still hetero or at most bi. She seems unaware that the prostate is a sexually useful organ that is often viewed as submissive behavior when men seek to pleasure it. 


Porn can be detrimental to young men perhaps because they have no reality from which to compare the fantasy. In my opinion, it is not because they misunderstand dominance as portrayed in one genre of porn. To me, there is a far greater chance of harming male ideas of real sex with real women when real women neglect to express their wants and needs to their male partners. Women talk about jackhammering, selfish guys, bad oral, lack of understanding the clit, focusing or orgasm as the goal type of guys but few tell them how to please them. Even if boys do get their ideas about sex from porn, I see very few people actually trying to teach them what they should be actually doing. 


Many women will go half of their adult lives without having an orgasm during sex simply because even they tend to not instruct boys on what they like and what they want to do during sex. Far worse than thinking you are supposed to be a ""cunt destroyer"" is a partner that lets you think it. 


I could go on forever talking about this but I will end by saying that male sexuality is complex. We are more nuanced than society gives us credit for. Wiseman, unfortunately seems to see porn as a detriment because she seems to view male sexuality in a one dimensional way. If she really wants to understand boys, she will have to learn about them from their perspective, not hers. ","1380586299"
"Scotch","t5_2qq65","That's besides the point.  For me, Iron Maiden is simply the best music that has ever been produced.  You may not agree, but that doesn't mean that your favorite band is somehow superior to my favorite band.  Remember taste, especially with scotch, cigars, wine, or music is highly subjective.  The point is not to look down on people based on what they enjoy.

If you can't find it by itself it will probably be in an ice maker supply kit. If it is deffenetly the heating system you won't even need to drain it. Make sure the supply water to the system is off. Put a hose to the drain on the boiler and start to drain the water. DO NOT open any air bleeders on the system. Watch the pressure gauge on the boiler. Once it hits zero it will begin to pull a vacume. The hose will eventually stop flowing fast and slow to a very small stream. At this point you can take a mini hack saw or whatever other delicate cutting tool you have on hand (dremel, multitool) and carefully cut the old one off. Have the new one ready to install. The pipe may need a little cleaning so will be able to hold your finger on the hole and clean up the pipe with steal wool. The pipe should be trying to suck air in at this point so you don't have to worry about leaking. Install the new valve as quickly as possible, refill and bleed the system and your set. ","1380586308"

It's just a drive to make little copies of you, by any reasonable means necessary.

Just because a rabbit has 8 siblings, doesn't mean it doesn't want to reproduce. If it does, it would be seen as having some defect.

This is known as *non-standard analysis*.  [Robinson](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Robinson.html) showed that there is a mathematically rigorous way to extend the real numbers to something called the hyperreal numbers, arrived at by adding infinitesimal quantities to the real numbers as well as what all the standard operations then imply the existence of (adding, dividing, etc.), so you get a set that includes the real numbers plus infinitesimal and infinite quantities and related objects.

When you split up dy/dx, you can view this as standard arithmetic operations in the hyperreals, and the results of calculus obtained this way are the same as the results obtained by the usual approach of limits, etc.

A text that develops calculus in this way is Keisler's, which is found [here](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html).","1380586311"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","You will not be forced to use ""obamacare"" because it is not an insurance plan.  I wouldn't use the PNN for insurance information as the majority of them have never had insurance other than Tricare.  You will continue to use whichever variation of Tricare you use.  

The biggest change will be the opening of insurance exchanges, basically websites where you can go and shop for an insurance plan, kind of like kyack.com for plane tickets.  The advantage to this is that it puts people who don't get insurance through their job into a pool which lowers prices.  If someone cannot afford insurance it will be provided, and if you can but choose not to you will be fined.

The Affordable Care Act also creates new regulations about how insurance companies can do business, for example you can no longer be denied due to a pre-existing condition.  It also requires employers to offer health insurance to full time employees.","1380586312"

As for the glasses, I think it's less about skin tone and more about your overall look. I wear glasses 24/7 and I always avoid colourful frames when browsing because neutrals are more versatile for *my* look. 

I think red glasses look best on bold people (in terms of fashion sense and aura). For instance, I saw this 60ish year old white woman with short cropped silver hair wearing bright red skinny jeans tucked into bright red suede-like red boots. She was wearing a black blouse and had red glasses. She looked fierce in what could have been a cartoonish outfit. 

For everyday wear, Bordeaux red glasses are easier to pull off because it's a more muted type of red, but it still offers a different look. Anyway, I'm sure you know what's best for your style so I hope you don't regret your decision!!! Remember, it always takes time to get used to new frames no matter what the colour.","1380586313"

My grandfather had a stroke last Monday.  The right side of his body is left paralyzed and he has trouble speaking and swallowing.  He recognizes us.  We can communicate through eye contact and facial expressions.  He hasn't realized that his right side is paralyzed and so tries to get up and pull his body up constantly.  He will be at the hospital until his condition stabilizes.  He will be 93 years old tomorrow.

Before I ask my questions, I'd like to thank you and all the kind nurses for all your help.  For cleaning his body, changing his sheets, and most importantly laughing with him and smiling at him, while doing all of this.  My grandfather couldn't have survived without your care and my mom would have gone crazy trying to handle everything by herself.

Here are my questions:

-Based on your experience, how much better can we expect him to get?

-We are trying to plan for his care after leaving the hospital.  Could we successfully care for him at home?  Or would a home/hospital be better for him in case of emergency?  What would you suggest?

-What will be the greatest risks for his health at home?

-How can I make his life better, easier and happier?  What's the best way I can help?

Why doesn't the other side just cave to their demands, then?  That would ensure the government would not shutdown, no?  My point is that both sides are fighting for what they believe in within the rules of the game.

Crafting: 11,738k with earth battlestaves from ge, 247k xp/hr. 126,361k cutting saphires, 200k/hr. 165,029k with blue d'hide body, 262k/hr. 227,174k with royal d'hide body, 352k/hr.

Smithing: 140,588k with ady platebody, up to 200k xp/hr. 98,782k with ady arrowheads, ~60k/hr. 

Summoning: 81,478k with geyser titan, 8,969 blue charms. Also 81,478k with swamp titans, 18,802 crimson charms. 54804k with wolpertinger pouch, once you are level 92, 16,100 crimson charms. Gold and green are very slow xp at your level.

Let's be clear: DRM has a material effect on the value of what you are selling. I'm not going to argue about whether or not to include it - it's just important to point out that by adding it you are creating an inconvenience for one's paying customers. That inconvenience will have a material impact on the value proposition.

I guess the hope is that the drop in value will be made up for by added sales from those that would have otherwise pirated it. But I suspect we'll see this DRM cracked within a couple of weeks, at which point it won't be doing anything but devaluing the product for legitimate buyers.","1380586325"

At that point, you might as well just stick an IV in everyone and have them sit in front of a TV/virtual reality. No one accounts for the additional desire to get drunk and then productivity will cease to exist as well.

That, and no one accounts for the service industries that this will kill off. Bye bye taxi drivers, bus drivers, transport/shipping, UPS, etc. We are talking about at least 10+ million laid off right off the bat. Mechanics would have to be certified to work on these cars and they would have to work at the dealerships, in which the liability is going towards anyway. There will be no aftermarket for automobiles, and government regulation would force people into NOT driving anymore, so there goes the group that actually enjoys driving. Don't forget killing off the car insurance market, since no one will ever hit anyone now.

The guy could have looked in the trunk, he could have been more a dick about where to park, they could've put the keys out of reach, they could've met in the basement or somewhere out of range of the gun, they could've just shot him without bringing out Jesse, etc. The fact it all just happened to go down exactly as planned just seemed a little contrived. Also, as others have pointed out, it was kinda convenient that every guy gets shot except the two guys that need ""special"" deaths. 

Like I said, I'm not complaining, because it was all a vehicle for the character interactions, but it was somewhat flat by this show's standards all the same.","1380586327"

&gt;What biological fact requires an attraction to the other person? 

Wow. Do I really need to spell it out for you? In this context ""attraction"" means desire to mate. If you do not have a desire to reproduce with the opposite sex, you will not have sex. 

&gt;Biology requires that we eat to survive, but it doesn't require that we eat appetizing food.

It requires that we seek out and desire food, all of which is appetizing if you are starving. This is a terrible analogy.

Music can be enjoyed on many levels, much like any other form of media. Even if I can't relate to something being sang about, I can still enjoy and appreciate the way a story or an idea is expressed. Pulp Fiction is often considered one of the best films of all time, yet I doubt most people can relate to it at all. Just because I've never snorted adderall or grown up in a shitty Detroit neighbourhood, doesn't mean I can't sit back and enjoy the stories Danny Brown has to tell, the interesting production, or the clever word play. The same goes for any other artist/genre. I can still enjoy music about things I've never experienced, in fact, its a lot more interesting when a song can present something new to me, rather than something I've done/felt many times before. 

TL;DR If you're only listening to music that you can relate to, you're really missing out.   ","1380586328"

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Definitely do a test run and see how it affects you. Try doing something productive after you've taken it - clean the house, do homework, etc. You'll end up wanting to anyway, and it's often the best gauge as to how well you perform on the drug compared to off of it.

As someone who has taken prescribed amphetamines for years in high school to assuage a pretty severe case of ADD, I can tell you that Adderall will not only help you in studying for a test, but it will invariably improve your mood, make you exponentially more efficient and productive in everything that you do, and (this is the best part for me) you'll be happy to do it. In fact, you may even seek out things to do that you wouldn't normally as a result of your newfound motivation.

Its effects on you will be no different during the SAT - you'll be highly motivated and feel ready to do the test and will most likely perform more efficiently than you would normally. When I took it, I finished the essay, a section of the test notorious for its strict time limit, six minutes ahead of schedule and got a perfect score. I do not recommend taking it as an IR as the SAT is a very lengthy test and you'll most likely burn out a lot sooner than you would like, and you don't want to be coming down off of adderall during an important test. 

That brings up one more thing worth mentioning, which is the number of side effects you may experience. I recommend against a large dose if you're prone to anxiety, as it will make you more on-edge. It will also most likely destroy your appetite for the duration of its effects, and coming down isn't awful, but it's definitely not fun either. That being said, good luck and enjoy, I'm here if you have any more questions.","1380586334"

In my later class, there's a really cute exchange girl. Unfortunately, she's usually with her group of exchange people, so it's hard to isolate her right after class. She's eyed me a few times before, and holds eye contact longer than I can usually. The other issue is that I'm 99% sure the girl next to me wants me, but I'm not really attracted to her whatsoever. She usually will end up cockblocking me by following me from the moment I get up to the spot where we part ways since I park in a different location. 

How would I go about asking the cute exchange girl out, while not getting cock blocked, while having to maybe do it in front of her friends? Direct, indirect?

"breakingbad","t5_2rlw4","My evidence actually came from a huge class at my university all about The Wire a couple years back. Lecture was filled to the brim of people who had never seen those other shows. Assignments were to watch episodes, etc. The Sopranos is actually getting quite ""old"", and is getting older by the minute, and my guess is that people who are that avid about The Wire that they post on reddit, probably are within a sample of people that really care about television in general (like us, basically).

And you are right, it was a generalized comment, and I apologize. I guess I could rephrase it this way: There was a stark difference in the audience for The Sopranos. The majority wanted Tony's head blown to bits at the end of the show. They wanted something explicit. They wanted something tangible so they didn't have to THINK and come to their own conclusion (of which there really is only one, and if you invested yourself in the show and could remember things up to a season prior, it was quite evident what the ending was). This same audience is the type that seems to love The Wire. Again, maybe a generalization, but I've seen this throughout many posts on Grantland/AVClub/HitFix etc, more ""general"" reviewing sites. The same people who hate what is probably the greatest ending in television history (omg i thought my cable box went out) tended to love The Wire, and I don't think my argument is totally disconnected from the reality. I would say that Chase was completely unapologetic to the claim that viewers needed to have their hands held. And I'd say that Simon was completely unapologetic in what he wanted the viewers to get out of the show. I find the former more interesting, and compelling television, than the latter.

I still stand by my simplistic claim, as that is really the primary reason I don't put The Wire up there with Mad Men/BB/Sopranos. There never was a moment in the show where I had a question, or questioned the significance of something, because it was flat out told to me by Simon. Maybe it was because I already agreed with ""his"" beliefs before watching the show? I will say that I can definitely see how The Wire can change your perceptions about X,Y,and Z, but it's becoming increasingly so that people already agree with Simon's views on X,Y, and Z as we are exposed to all of the horrible things it points out on a more daily basis.

However, there's a reason a bunch of people still haven't watched The Wire, and it's not due to it's simplicity, it's about its execution. The simplicity of The Wire is just my personal reason for not putting the show up on the grand pedestal. But nine times out of ten, you ask someone why they haven't watched The Wire, it's because they don't care about the characters, or they say it's incredibly slow. To me, that's evidence of poor execution. You can say that Simon didn't give a shit and that wasn't the point, but that still doesn't stop me from saying it's not as compelling a story as the other top tier guys, in my opinion.","1380586337"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had a couple of gang members try to rob me/hurt me at around 3am in New York once. I have a concealed gun license, and carry my gun all the time, they didn't know that. One threatened me with a knife, I told him i had a gun and he needed to walk away, he didn't listen. I then pulled my gun out and told him to walk away, he kept walking closer, so I shot him in the leg.

There was a girl watching through a window wondering what the noise was that called 911, the guy I shot and his friends ran, I just sat there and waiting for the police.


But to be honest, it didn't really affect me in a ""Oh my god I just shot a guy."" kinda way, it might have been because it was a guy threatening my safety, but I don't think I would be affected me anyway. I worry about it sometimes, the fact that death or seeing death doesn't bother me. I'm not a crazy guy or someone who wants to go out and kill someone, but it just doesn't.

I'm a huge gamer, and I'm going to go into a controversial topic (on reddit) about how shootings and stuff are blamed on video games. I think video games affect the people playing, I played Duke Nukem, golden eye, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, all of those games; and I think that after a while, killing someone in those games stops affecting you personally and morally, I think that under the right circumstances, be it disease or mental, that video games COULD be the fault of some deaths. I think I blame video games for the reason I didn't feel bad about it or shocked about what happened.

So yeah, sorry I went off topic, that happens sometimes when I start typing.

Edit: I didn't shoot him after two warnings, it was many warnings and I didn't want to, but I had to shoot him.

Edit2: A month after this incident I did move to Georgia, so I no longer own a license and don't feel like I need one.

We don't go to the doctor very often,so we never reached the 7,000 for them to have to help pay anything. Then it would start over every year. 
I know you're right about the catastrophic thing happening. Say somehow we have a 20,000 dollar medical bill. His company's insurance would be good to have then. But when almost half his check is going to insurance that we don't use it just seemed pointless. 
If he got no overtime and never went overseas to work for his company, just 40 hours a week at his hourly rate, we wouldn't even be able to pay for the insurance. 
We'd probably qualify for this Obama care stuff if they went by that, but his actual check stubs are always a lot more than his base pay because he works so much. 
I emailed an insurance company about sending me some quotes and what not. Fingers crossed. ","1380586356"

Here's a nice quote, though:

&gt;At the heart of the ’60s radical zeitgeist was a sense that the government had forfeited its legitimacy, and that the liberal establishment had sold out or lost its nerve. At the heart of the right-wing uprising is a similar sense of betrayal: the president is not just an adversary but an alien; the Republican leadership has lost its principles; the old rules don’t apply.","1380586357"

I've enjoyed playing FFXIV, but I feel like I'm done with it now as well. I'm already tired/bored of the gear treadmill after having did AK/CM/etc. 100+ times to gear up my jobs. It was decent while questing/doing each dungeon once, but the dungeon/fate grind @ end-game is typical grindy MMORPG fare. It doesn't feel fun to me at all.

To that note, I don't find WoW or etc. any better. I think I'm bored with MMORPG's in general.

I'm in the ESO/WildStar beta and I don't know what to think about them yet (they're both in too rough a shape to give a fair judgement on yet, beta is beta). They probably won't be any better though (to be fair WildStar claims they want to change that and make their end-game different/more fun, but it's all empty promises at this point until we see it).

I'm just rambling now. tl;dr I agree, I'm bored as well. I think I'll let my free time run out and check out the game again for 2.1 to see if what they add is enough to earn my sub.","1380586357"

I'm against being forced into agreements/contracts that I don't want to sign. 

Your implication that I'm against shared costs doesn't make sense. People hire their own private security all the time, that's not uncommon, it's a service that's has shared benefits. A building owner pays for security in a building you work in, you get the benefit of the security they provide, for example. Air traffic controllers would (and do) still exist if it weren't regulated by the government. Some countries are completely privately controlled, Canada for example, is controlled by a corporation called ""Nav Canada"". I think America has one of the only entirely publicly funded/controlled ATC networks.

Three things you can do to stop this bullshit abuse:

* There is a fight on surveillance bills **right now**.  Call your congressmen and tell them to support the [ The Intelligence Oversight and Surveillance Reform Act] (http://www.wyden.senate.gov/priorities/surveillance-reform) **and** the [Surveillance State Repeal Act](http://holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1200&amp;Itemid=18).  Tell them they must **not** support Diane Feinstein's NSA bill (she is the Chair of the Senate Intel Committee and NSA's chief defender), as it actually **expands** NSA's powers while pretending to be a reform bill.  You can get the phone numbers you need [HERE](http://www.contactingthecongress.org/) or [HERE](https://www.aclu.org/secure/stopnsa)

* Join the massive EFF/ACLU-coordinated NSA protest planned here: [http://rally.stopwatchingus.com](http://rally.stopwatching.us) 
([More information here, discussing how to get free training on lobbying your congress critters](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/time-speak-against-nsas-mass-spying))

* Ask your friends, parents, relatives, and anyone else to do the same.  Carry a little note around with you that has a list of the bill names above and phone numbers for your state's congressmen, so you can make it effortless for anyone to do it on the spot.

* **If you're not American, just donate a couple euro to the [EFF](http://www.eff.org/donate), who exist to fight these kind of programs.**","1380586364"

If you think the empire collapsing was a bad thing you need to think beyond 'imperialism = bad'. The empire ensured that over a quarter of the earth was unified under one banner for the first time in history. Africa was prospering. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and America were first world nations comparable to Britain herself, India was united for the first time in history. Given another half century or more under imperial rule (e.g no more WW2 and American economic imperialism) most of the countries that are now third nations would be on the level of Can, Oz and NZ. Besides even if you don't believe the empire was a good thing for the world surely you can't deny that it was undeniably good for Britain itself?

I also masturbate as procrastination ALL the time. Need to do homework? Sure.. let me just get something out of the way first. lol.

Oh and if it matters to you, I'm 30. And yes, I still realize that this is the exception rather than the rule, but I think it works out. Even though I love sex a lot, and even though it relives my stress, I still don't think it's as devastating for me when I don't ""get any"" as it *seems* to be for guys. ","1380586370"

"ProgrammingLanguages","t5_2qi8m","&gt; So, your proposal is one way to implement OO. You seem to be confusing the OO principle with its implementations and its syntax sugar.

Fair enough. Sugar is what makes people use certain principles over others, though.

&gt; Why would you not want to do that way? The matching of a message is slower than a direct (non-virtual) call to a method. Classes also map more directly to the byte-code when compared to closures.

I think the common patterns are blatant enough that a compiler optimization could take care of them reliably. I'd rather have a simple language core with performance optimizations than a large core that forces me to do these optimizations as part of the spec.

Furthermore, consider the state of existing dynamic OO languages. A lot of them give you a way to execute arbitrary code on message dispatch: `__getattr__` in Python, `method_missing` in Ruby, metatables in Lua, and so forth. These seem like improvised workarounds to make inherently limited systems do things that you get for free with closures.

Discussion Question:

I... I don't really have one. I usually keep a couple bottles of water beside the couch, and I generally don't snack while I play because I like to keep my stuff clean. I don't really need anything to stay up late, I just kind of have this ridiculous power that lets me stay up well past a reasonable hour just to play games. Doing anything else and I pass out. I drink a lot of water though to get me up from the couch frequently.

I disagree with the latter part of your comment and your shit sarcasm. Individuals and communities have a vested interest in not letting people 'fall off' as you describe. And for that matter, even conservatives support social safety nets for the completely lame of society. All the same though, it is important for people, individually and as social groups, to compete and strive for improvement and position. This is what keeps us advancing in a (progressive) evolutionary sense. In spite of ourselves we still live in a natural world of limited resources and assets. ","1380586380"

And petit-bourgeoisie doesn't specifically mean middle class, but it's good shorthand for discussing the sort of not-poor idiot who thinks they have some sort of vested interest in perpetuating our current system.

Seriously though, I was all primed to answer you in earnest, and you are literally dismissing me because I used big words. ""Core states? He must be talkin' gibberish.""

ed: I'll talk you through this like a child. Look at individual words.

Neoliberalism: The classically Liberal world economic system, maintained by international cooperative instituions.

Capital accumulation: Making money. Hoarding money. Having fucktons of money.

Predicated on the exploitation and peripheralization of non-core states: The first world actively exploits the third through unfair trade agreements and a massive array of interventionist policy. That is the foundation for neoliberalism. A good example of this is the slow economic collapse of the Ottoman empire in the 19th century while it struggled to adapt to the modern system of nation-state global mercantilism.

I really want to think you're a decent enough dude for at least asking these questions - and there's probably some iota left in you that isn't callous and selfish, since I see you post in Christian ancaps, which means you're theoretically beholden to some morality.

Once I got the dense ores page, I just put all the bad, but not world damaging modifiers I had on it (eternal storms, extreme heat or whatever it's called: this didn't make a difference to me since you'd be underground anyways) and went to the age. It took a couple of tries to find one that wasn't decaying, but when I did, it was a matter of taking overpowered fortune 4 dartcraft pickaxes and autosmelt/macerate ones and going to town.

"CCW","t5_2s4mc","I used to work in property management and this incident took place in a home on Detroit's east side. I was the locksmith and inspector and this tenant was evicted and I was sent there to assess the damages done to the home as well as rekey all of the locks. Well an hour after the bailiffs left, the tenant, his family, and a large group of 12 of his homeboys (some wielding blunt objects varying from crow bars to baseball bats) returned to find their belongings in dumpsters and then a lot of yelling ensues (I assume they came prepared with so many people due to a neighbor tipping them off as they were not home when they were evicted). This former Marine (we do background checks on all tenants, and I like to know of any violent history before an eviction as a person losing their home can act unpredictably) with about a foot and 100lbs on me ended up pulling open the locked security gate as I stand there in the hallway all while making threats and claiming I broke into his home. I did not have a pistol at the time so carried my AR-15 everywhere with me and was dumb enough not to bring it in the house as not to scare the neighbors watching the guys belongings. Well I realize I don't have my gun on me when he breaks down the door and all I remember was turning to run for the side door and next thing I recall, i'm at my vehicle with my AR-15 loaded and aimed at the guy. He stopped, then his group went wild when they saw my gun. Some made threats of leaving to go grab their guns, my aim then focused on them and told them I would shoot if they moved. It stopped them rather quickly. After a few minutes of this stand off of them making threats, I called the police, they called the police, neighbors called the police, I called my supervisor to get there with the bailiffs and the paper work showing they were legally evicted, then he called the police. As much as I wanted to leave, they boxed my car in. I could not even drive over the lawn to get away due to a tree on my passenger side. After a few minutes, they stop with the threats, I lower my rifle, I then tell the tenant my supervisor is on his way and that we're gonna get this eviction situation figured out. My supervisor arrives about a half hour later with about 4 or 5 of our other workers to board up the house, along with with all the paperwork and shows they've been legally evicted and tells them they need to get their stuff and leave and that they are trespassing and once again call the police. After about 4.5 hours from the start of the incident, we got them to leave as well as un-trap my vehicle, got the home secured, and we all went home. In that time, not a single police officer showed up. 


I dont know if everything I did was the right thing to do...but I'm just glad everyone calmed down and went home that night. Even if I didn't get any sleep that night, I was glad to be home and alive. The thought of what could have happened still bothers me...What if I was too slow? What if I just plain didn't have my gun with me that day? would I have been beaten to death by this group of guys who thought I was at fault for them being kicked out? Hell, i was just there to make a list of damages and cost and to change the locks..I had ZERO to do with the eviction process. Since that day I have incorporated self defense practice into my every day life.


**TL;DR**
Work in property management, go to rekey home that had been evicted, tenant shows up with a group of people armed with blunt weapons, block my car from leaving, breaks in security gate I had locked for my safety, didnt bring my AR-15 into the house, run for the car, grab my rifle, things deescalate from there, 4.5 hours pass with at least 5 calls to the police, no police show up, they leave, car is unblocked, we all go home, no shots fired, no sleep that night.","1380586392"

Lobbies perform a vital function within democracies, and the fact that the ones causing the most damage are the ones with the most money is just an unhappy side effect of the fact that we are a capitalist democracy. There's nothing that can be done about lobbies except for increased transparency in the political process, which has nothing to do directly with lobbies. Plus, its irrational to target lobbies generally considering each issue has a lobby on both sides. It's like saying all lawyers are bad, which is ignorant because for every lawyer fighting for a bad cause, is the lawyer on the other side fighting for a good cause. Lawyers are just a necessary consequence of having a sophisticated adversarial legal system and are a vital part of said system.","1380586398"

And so the duo began their own meth empire, using Louis' Mexican uncle's connections to keep expanding. They blackmailed the owner of the largest cereal box manufacturing plant in North America, and used specially marked packages to distribute to grocery stores accross America. The real reason he hated Walt, and refused his money? He already had plenty, and tried to push Walt away so he didn't get hurt by any rivalry. He bought Saul's laser tag (who, BTW, had no clue that he was Walt's son as he referred to himself as ""Flynn Masterson"", and thus acted like they had just met each other at the car wash when Saul was actually surprised) and began laundering money himself.

No, I would let individual components register for events, that way you couple the gameplay logic they 'respond to' with the specific component itself, rather than just being a giant grabbag of 'so who gets this one, guys?'. Using delegates/callbacks is probably the best way to go about it, not just for speed, but so you can customize the function names, making it clear that 'THIS function processes THIS event'. Code legibility becomes very important when you've got an event system like this, since it might take you bouncing between several different classes before you get to the bottom of the consequences of one particular action (like the box example above). But, so long as the individual pieces of logic are separated into nice bite-size chunks, and you can trace the events around, it becomes second-nature after a while.

Right now I have two girls, after hoping and praying that my first would be a boy, because I'm just not a girly girl, I was so sure I would have no idea what to do with a girl.

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","A few thoughts about the PhD (and graduate school in general):

I don't know of anyone that was prepared to handle grad school when they start. Doing your own independent research is a lot different than passing pre-set classes for good grades in undergrad. It's A LOT to adjust to.

Second, you didn't get in on a fluke, you got in because, between your GPA, GRE, application, and interview, you are a good candidate for the program.

That being said, I haven't seen once why you want to do well in this program. Do you actually want the PhD because of a specific career opportunity or because you want to do research or teach? I'd get yourself to a therapist through school. They are trained at talking through these issues to help get at what's *really* causing a lack of motivation. Decide what you want out of the program and if it's not going to work for you in the long run with your goals, there's no harm in dropping out.

Also realize that taking time off during the PhD should you discover that you have more pressing issues that must be addressed (most of the time it's medical or due to a family emergencies) can be arranged.","1380586412"

However, until now the precise circuit connectivity with the LH that mediated this has not been known.  In addition, we also demonstrate that direct stimulation of local stimulation of LH GABA neurons can also promote feeding.

One day he pulled up to the high school baseball field and saw several dozen people all sitting on the guard rail, watching the game.

He crept forward and touched his bumper to the metal rail, then flipped the switch on the spark coil.  *ZAP!*  Several dozen people, all along the fence, all jumped off like...well...like they'd been zapped.

I dunno if this is possible, or if dad was just blowing smoke?  But he *did* have several Model T spark coils on his shelf in the basement.  I used to play around with them until I lit myself up one fine night.  After that, they *stayed on the shelf.*","1380586416"

-What we do know is The Bible is the Word of God (2 Tim 3:16).
- Jesus said that we need The Bible to live and grow in Christ (Matt 4:4)
-We are to meditate on the meaning of the stories in The Bible, learn, and follow the teachings (Joshua 1:8)
-The Bible is the Living God speaking through it. (Heb 4:12)

There is no correct way to interpret the stories in The Bible. If you believe they are metaphorical, right on! If you believe that they are literal, right on! I too have wondered about if The Bible can really be trusted. I understand that doubts of the authenticity of The Bible can hold you back. IMO I think that your relationship and justification with Jesus is most important aspects of Christianity. If you're having trouble believing The Bible is true, talk to a trusted Christian pastor, friend, or family member.","1380586418"

Not trying to be a downer here, but I think you may find that, when you reach your financial goals, life doesn't become a big party on the other side.

But again, thank you for your kind words.","1380586428"

"breastfeeding","t5_2rdj4","you could, but the best thing to do IMO would be to try and get the baby to use both so your supply is more equal. 
He had back problems due to trauma during the birth that was not noticed until i realized he wasnt comfortable turning his head to one side to drink, sleep or wouldnt be able to turn his head when hearing a noise. 
After a few sessions in physio he is as good as new but my breasts suffered a lot, the left one is barely producing despite trying to pump and the right one took over producing for both and i had plugged ducts and mastitis very often as a result. 
I didn't respond well to pumping at all and now he's old enough to completely refuse to drink from the weak boob. 
So if there is a reason your LO has a strong side preference it should be adressed, but don't worry, it's not a problem for most mothers. 
most women find one breast produce more than the other naturally but its not a real problem. 

TLDR get baby to drink from both, pumps suck. ","1380586432"

If I see the films before I read the books, it's much easier for me to separate the books from the films. Books are for long time entertainment. I read slowly and think a lot about what I read in books. Try to figure out what happens next, try to figure out what could happen afterwards with the characters and so on. My favourite character in a book is probably Tom Bombadil even though he gets so much hate from people but I could spent hours trying to find explanations for him (and I've read amazing stuff from others about Tom Bombadil).

"Lyme","t5_2rzlq","Some background from my doctor:
""CURRENT TREATMENT GUIDELINE
The treatment guidelines that were drafted by the Infectious Disease Society of American (IDSA) and adopted by the CDC and most, if not all, health insurance companies, call for 30 days of antibiotic treatment for chronic Lyme disease. There has never been a study demonstrating that 30 days of antibiotic treatment cures chronic Lyme. On the contrary, much medical literature has been published in both the United States and Europe demonstrating that short courses of antibiotic treatment fail to eradicate the Lyme bacteria and that short treatment courses result in upwards of a 40% relapse rate, especially if treatment is delayed.
The International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) has advocated a second standard of care that differs from the IDSA standard of care. ILADS and its members have advocated for the following changes to be made to those guidelines promulgated by the IDSA and CDC:
• Since there is currently no definitive test for Lyme disease, laboratory results should not be used to exclude an individual from treatment
• Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis and test should be used to support, rather than supersede the physician's judgment.
• The early use of antibiotics can prevent persistent, recurrent and refractory Lyme disease.
• The duration of therapy should be guided by clinical response, rather than by an arbitrary (i.e., 30 day) treatment course.
By adopting these changes, physicians will no longer fear prosecution from their medical boards for treating Lyme beyond 30 days, patients will no longer be denied care and they will no longer have to battle their insurance companies for coverage of treatment.""

I prefer it to KRACH because it avoids the problem of what to do with an undefeated team (by the use of the Laplace method) - but like KRACH it does not consider margin of victory (or, to a lesser extent, home field advantage) so it's not great for prediction. However, there was an extension of the Colley method published a few years ago which attempted to add those features to improve predictive power: you can find the details on that [here.](http://www.mathaware.org/mam/2010/essays/PasteurPredictive.pdf) (the Colley method was originally developed for college football, so that's the context in which they set it there - but you can do something similar for baseball.)

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Thanks for the feedback ajantis and I agree on what to focus on to better understand potential injuries. My main goal with the survey is to try and connect the dots between ANY pain or discomfort to what the user is playing, on what system, and for what period of time. I put in age because I hypothesize that gamer's thumb would affect younger children or older adults because of developing and dwindling muscles, respectively.

This research is actually for my senior level Industrial Design class where after all the research, I'm to come up with a ""solution"" of sorts, so to limit my scope and give me something to focus on as far as a solution goes, I decided to stick with controllers with analog sticks since the thumbs are constantly stationed on the sticks which give much more resistance than the squishier buttons.

Honestly though, it's really hard to pinpoint any commonality with pain or discomfort since everyone is different in terms of tolerance, hand size, or preexisting problems, so I'm hoping talking to you guys and my survey will give me a better feel for what the users are experiencing.

These are what people tend to forget. The hyper inflated number that I hear a lot is that walmart costs the country $1.7Billion per year. Well they pay clost to $8billion in taxes. So in the end we still make about $6billion a year off of them.\

Of course, that is the internet for you.  The person is either without sin, or an asshole.  Generally, on the internet everyone is an ass.

As far as the pope is concerned.  Thing is, I got a soft spot for Roman Catholics.  After marrying my wife things in life sorta put me in a corner where I had to start going to a United Church of Christ church.  Protestant I think.
Know what?
Flesh didn't rot off my arms!  I was so surprised.

But I have a real soft spot for the Catholic Church.  This crap that has been going on over the last 15 years.  The pedophilia, the lawsuits, the bad press, the loss of parishoners.
The church REALLY brought it on themselves.
When people rub this stuff in my face I shrug my shoulders and I say, 'Yep, all true.  Actually, it is a bit worse then you know.'.

And for so many of those years the church just shoved there heads in the sand.  It was maddening.

The other guy....Pope Benedict, Ratzinger.  Wether the guy deep down is a decent guy or not is imaterial, he wasn't making things better for the church.
The RC church wasn't going to die.  It it too large to die in my lifetime.  But what was going on was just so ugly.

Pope Francis, for me personally he is offering the first hint that something can be done to heal this mess.

The infallible thing.  I remember being taught as a kid that the Pope was part Jesus.  In matters of Religion it was Gods lips to the Popes ears.  He was infalliable in matters of religion.
But in matters of man he was human.
So if he is sneaking out from a secret door to a brothel - that is human.  But if he is telling us Mass can be said in English, that is God.

I am not smart enough to comment more then that.  My instinct is that the infallibility thing is too big of a deal to go away.  I mean, if you look through church history really huge things have occurred centered around the issue of the Pope and if he really is god incarnate.  
Wether you are right or wrong, I suspect that it will be a cold day in hell before the church gives that up.

What I do know, is that for as little as I liked Pope Benedict when he served, I really am humbled at the way he stepped aside.  I have a ton of respect for that.
And Pope Francis is easily the best thing to happen to the church in my lifetime.","1380586445"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I skipped everything else since we were talking about Skyler and I felt it was implied that it wasn't just her, but really the whole first episode is about Walt basically being defeated in life. It's **not** just Skyler who is a 'problem' in Walt's life, it's everyone and everything, including himself.

Not long after the scene in the desert we get to breakfast where Skyler has decided to serve veggie bacon instead of regular bacon because Walt is now 50 and needs to watch his cholesterol. He clearly doesn't like it, but says nothing, though Flynn complains about it, and is clearly frustrated by how his dad just meekly accepts it. It really annoyed me because it just came off as this stereotypical pushy-wife behavior, with him as the hen-pecked husband.

In other episodes though when they're in the doctor's office together, Skyler takes over. On the few occasions he tries to speak up she just sort of re-asserts control and acts as if she is speaking for the both of them. She's all ""we feel this way, we feel that way"", without ever actually consulting Walt about anything, and he just shrinks back into his chair.","1380586447"

"DayM","t5_2uow6","Once again things came up, so I haven't had time to code, so I've had to delay the project for a tiny bit.

Anyways here's what I have planned...

I'm going to start with re-defining the mod...
A lot of people see this as a DayZ clone...

DayZ and pretty much every other zombie game has problems with keeping players from just killing on sight, trolling and all those things...

And the games that have that solved, their solution always forces players to play in a certain way...

So I'm trying to solve that without forcing the player to play a certain way.
DayM is supposed to be a Zombie apocalypse kind of mod.


In a real world scenario, you wouldn't shoot people on sight...


and the reason that happens with games and mods like DayZ, is simple.

You gotta make the zombies the real enemy.

After I code the zombie AI, other players will be useful, sure you can still murder eachother... but if I make it just hard enough for people to find food and shelter, other survivors will be a big part in it...

However I'm not forcing people to play with other survivors, it just makes it easier.

You could have a group of survivors, you split them in 2, tell one group to make bunch of noise in a barricaded house with a good exit, so zombies hear the noise and the other team can go loot a super market...

and that's just one of the many things I have planned.

The same scenario can be done with 1 player, but it would take more resources and would be more challenging...


If you think that's not fair, it is because that's how it would work in the real world, going lone wolf might be hard, but every play style has its pros and cons.


Now I do have to fix my 1.2.3 version, I'll probably fix and then release and then I'll work on 1.2.4 which will be the cool update.


I'll post more info once I have time again.

It was the first game for just about everything (for a lot of people) ..and that's why it is so memorable. EQ took on a lot of qualities of certain MUDs of the day and wrapped some pretty graphics around the core concepts.

Quests weren't really a thing at this point in gaming. Even in NWN (on AOL) you were sorta free to do whatever. Same with Shadows of Yserbius, or LORD, or Crosswinds, or MMud, or TA, or TradeWars, or Sojourn/Duris/Basternae, or whatever other games were popular at that time.

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","First of all, nothing about your background or the way you entered your program is at all suspect or ""fraudulent."" When an admissions committee sits down with a stack of apps they realize each individual is putting his/her best face forward - universities are aware you're selling yourself, and they make the best decisions they can with the information they have access to (and on the flip side - most programs participate in a similar level of salesmanship by focusing on their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses when recruiting students). It doesn't sound like you lied or even misled anyone about your qualifications and your GPA and GRE were certainly earned on your own merits whether or not you thought it was a struggle. I think many programs pick people who may not have tons of experience in a given subfield but who seem smart and up to the challenge - you are almost surely incorrect when you assume you got in mainly because of timing or some fluke.

Whether or not you think grad school is the right decision for you at this point in your life is a separate question, but before you make a decision, I think it would be good for you to really internalize that you ""deserve"" to be there just as much as anyone else. Also - whenever people write these perspectives, there's this common element of ""I know it's common to feel insecure in grad school and it's simply impostor syndrome, but I'm afraid my situation is different - I'm actually an impostor!"" Do you see how silly that sounds - I'm not trying to trivialize what you're going through, I just hope you realize that this **is** exactly what other people are referring to and there's no reason to assume you're an extreme case.

I can't really help you with the meat of your problem (whether or not grad school is right for you), but I'd like to raise a few points. It's easy to imagine your amazing alternatives when you're unhappy, but I think it's important to really evaluate your other options from a sober frame of reference. Would hiking the AT for 9 months be THAT fulfilling - what would you do after? Would living in France really make you feel better, or would it just be temporarily more comfortable - would it obviously lead to a long-term plan? Is the Peace-Corps (where you have to live in a foreign country of their choice without leaving for 2 years) really viable for you, and if it is, does that truly sound like the right decision in the long-term? Perhaps these other scenarios are truly better... just make sure you look at them realistically. On that same note, try and imagine a realistic scenario in which you finish this year on a good note. How would you feel at the end of the year?","1380586455"

Meanwhile, the men of the tribe would do everything in their power to make sure the boy did *not* survive--keeping game away from the valley, stealing the boy's collected supplies while he slept, and praying to their gods for drought and disease. If the boy survived the ordeal, he was welcomed as a full member of the tribe.","1380586457"

Now that Microsoft has bought the handset business from Nokia, they are going to attempt to launch a fully integrated experience between all devices.

Much like in the Mac world, where there is very close communication between your devices, it will (hopefully) be a fluid experience requiring very little setup or user input.

If they can nail console quality streaming, and open up the back catalogue of xbox 360 titles, then you could in theory play ANY 360 game on the Xbox One, PC or windows phone without taxing your own hardware.

If they get there, and integrate it in the way i see in my mind (but have difficulty explaining) then it will be a game changer.  Can you imagine a Microsoft version of Google Glass, but one that could stream xbox 360 titles?","1380586458"

This is a shitty thing to write in a place where I'm supposed to be changing your mind, but if you have the time add [this](http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/classics/manifesto.html ) to your growing reading list. If you have little time, read at least section 1. If you have no time, read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto#I._Bourgeois_and_Proletarians). I'm not saying that you or I need to agree completely with my good friends Friedrich and Karl, but it will go a long way toward understanding of some of the subjects that will come up when you talk to anarchists. (My apologies if this is condescending and you know more than you are letting on here.)

&gt;Where I live everyone gets the right amount of life sustaining goods.

[Maybe](http://www.cpag.org.uk/child-poverty-facts-and-figures).

&gt;Its not 100% perfect but nothing can be.

Certainly.

&gt;(even if i was't it could still be tightened up a bit. More welfare, stronger safety nets, that kinda thing)

And that's great. Social welfare is a great thing and we both agree that it's a shitty thing when someone is poor and hungry in a country that has more than enough. There's nothing in my personal philosophy against social welfare, except that it has the potential to conceal from us the true cause of the need for social welfare, namely the economic system itself that is indifferent to the suffering of the underclass.

&gt;I'd still want to pay taxes and I don't mind the police using force.

This is something I hear from people who are not on the shit end of the police force stick. I'm not saying this is why *you* think this way, but would you feel different if you were a Muslim American? Or if you lived on the edge of poverty in a group that isn't treated well by the police?

&gt;The newspaper based its findings on intelligence documents from the CIA and DSGE (the French General Directorate for External Security) showing that Israeli, French and South African mercenaries had been involved in planning a coup to overthrow Condé.

&gt;According to the intelligence files dated September 13 and quoted by the French newspaper, the mercenaries aimed to provoke the Guinean police and armed forces to hurt citizens in order to incite political unrest in the West African republic ahead of the elections.","1380586474"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Alright, I have to explain a few things before I let you know my position.
Politics in the Middle East by Arabic/Muslim countries is usually theocratic, but even if it's not, it's either the Sunni or the Shiite that hold power. Each one of these groups wants to hold power so the other does not release laws suppressing the other's rights, so this has been a big conflict. Every civil war in the middle east has had this issue as a part of it - look at Iraq Civil War - 60% Shiite , 40% Sunni, the Sunni wanted to keep Saddam as a dictator because they knew they don't hold majority and if Saddam is out, they will be suppresed by the Shiite. The shiite, the same, has been wanting to grab power in many other countries in which it holds a large amount, which has led to a lot of problems, i.e. Yemen, Lebanon, Libya, etc. 

Syria right now is 75% Sunni, 15% Shiite, and the rest are Christians, Druze, non-religious, etc. Syria for a while now has been implementing laws that favor the alawites (which is a sect of shiite) while hurting the Sunni, (some are as ridiculous as lanes on the road where only shiite can drive). This has caused the Sunni to be extremely unhappy and protests over Syria started. Assad, knowing that the majority of Syria does not want him, has killed those protesters which led to the civil war. Assad's father, who was in power for over 30 years until he could no longer do his job and decided to give that title to his son, did the same thing. So, to argue whether Assad is a dictator or not is merely stupid, because it is clear that he is.

At first, The Free Syrian Army (FSA) has taken up arms against Assad. These people overall mainly wanted to establish a democracy and get rid of this dictator. Throughout this 2 and a half year conflict, they slowly were losing. So, they accepted the help of terrorist groups such as al nusra and al qaeda for example. Fighters from all over the Islamic world have come to Syria's aid, and many of them want to establish a theocracy in which only Sunni can ever enjoy freedom, much like Assad did to shiites and other minorities while the Sunni (the majority as stated before) suffered. 

So are the Syrian rebels terrorists and evil? No. But some who want to establish this idea of a theocracy in which only they have power are. But, these groups are not united, and will eventually start fighting (some less prominent fights have already been broken). Syria knows that Assad is not wanted by the popular majority as neither was his father, so of course this worries them.

So what is the deal to fix this? To make sure that the people of Syria get what they want, while the  Christians and Shiite do not suffer, and democracy is established? Well, I believe the answer would be to support the FSA and nothing else. Once the FSA prevails, it will use its power to hold fair elections, and being that the majority of Syria is not religious, they will not implement a theocracy in which others are hurt.

Its actually really hard not to! I've dropped from my avg weekly distance of 25 k (2x10km and 1x5km) to about 10 km and I have definitely slowed down. And I have no shame in taking a walk break if I need one (or more likely a bathroom break!)

As far as impacting fertility, you need to have a body fat percentage that is quite low to negatively impact your fertility. I don't know anything about you so take this how ever you see fit, but I recommend running as a great  way to improve your over all health when trying to conceive. And so long as you can listen to your body you can keep running as long as you feel good! Its crazy how many people think that pregnancy is some sort of ""medical condition"" that renders you an invalid. Not to mention, taking 40 weeks off from physical activity before doing the most physically challenging thing you might ever do in your life (birthing a person!) seems a little backwards to me.

Ads are there to convince you to buy something you don't neccessarily need, you've cherry-picked the rare example of an ad reminding you of something you already want. If that was the case for most ads, why would they spent billions making them? If ""Here is that thing you already wanted"" was enough - because it's not, 

Most marketing **is** targeted at people that already want the product. They are trying to convince consumers to purchase *their product* instead of someone else's.

Somehow got credited with a 300' kill. I was arcing bb's and it was dropping off 50' before then. No idea how. I swear it must have been someone else. But there was no-one there.

**Look before you leap**

It had been raining the week before and we were new to this field. My friend is a very aggressive player and runs right into fire. Dives into a foxhole with what he described as ""It looked like 1-2 inches of water"" When in reality it was about 1-2 feet. 

Meanwhile I'm over at spawn and suddenly the radios start acting up. Static everywhere, tried sniffing out the interference, couldn't figure it out, this is a semi encrypted channel.

Back in the firefight my radio is sitting underwater along with his gun and a few magazines in his pocket while the enemy team looks on in astonishment. This caused a few problems. The main one being his gun barrel got so much water in it. The bb's would preform a barrel roll upon exiting the gun. I'm not even joking. I have no idea how, all I know is that's what it did when I shot it while trying to fix it. The rest of the people got a good laugh over it too. Called it the Jesus gun.

And my radio is still sitting there, soaked and fcked. (damn)

Cue next game. Where is my friend? Yep. Waist deep in water getting kill after kill. I told him he wasn't getting in my van if he kept getting wet. Seemed to solve the problem.

It's certainly possible to feel a 'different temperature' in response to external stimuli.

For example, if you jump out of an ice bath, and immediately step into a warm shower, the water will initially feel *scalding*, even though it's perfectly tolerable.

So I would say the short answer is probably ""yes"". It's *possible* for the body/mind to incorrectly gauge temperature. I just have no idea how on earth you'd induce it without a compelling sensory stimulus.","1380586484"

For example, if you are hunting in the north east, you get a lot of rolling rollings, fallen trees, and large rocks. So your standard bipod that you planned to use may be too short. Forcing you to shoot from a kneeling or standing position to get over the obstacle. A lot of these field expedient positions were written down in old military manuals or writings by Col. Cooper. They seem to have fallen out of style with modern rifles.

Personally, I have used a few of them. I have used packs on dead trees, or grabbed a tree while standing and rested my rifle on my arm that way.

Not as steady as a bipod and a rear bag, but conditions in the wild, so to speak, might not allow for standard positions. ","1380586486"

"Trichsters","t5_2s7dh","Here is a fantastic article on the use of NAC, I really recommend reading it:

http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=483113

Literature has found that 1200 mg-2400 mg to be effective (you take half the dose in the morning and half in the evening), with a period of 2 weeks or so between ""bump ups"". The article goes into more depth about this. It's not necessarily getting a greater effect, for some people it is and for some people they just hit that magic dose and everything sort of happens at once. 

There is no benefit of stopping at any time. It passes through your system pretty quickly, so it needs to be continuous. Also, I am not aware of any vitamin or mineral depletion with NAC, at least in recent research. We have never combined inositol and NAC together, as they are similar and I don't really think they would boost each other in any way. I would recommend those as separate treatment options, at least from what we know right now. ","1380586496"

You can be omnibenevolent and know that the best thing to do is give another creature the capacity to protect themselves and learn for themselves how best to do that.  
  
Considering that the entire basis of the age of the messiah in Judaism is that it is ushered in when most people 'have knowledge of god' and that to know god you must not be forced and instead choose to seek god out for understanding otherwise you wouldn't know god you'd be forced by the will of god, the deity with omnibenevolence chooses to give humans free will because it is the best thing that can be done.  
  
(That being said I don't buy the best of all possible worlds idea because I feel like it wouldn't unbalance the equation much if people had more benevolent cheats, like people having a slightly higher mental capacity when it comes to understanding compassion, or having much better medical technology, and so on. Obviously anything that can be used for good can be used to hurt or destroy, so I understand the balance argument. Regardless, I feel like if this was the best of all possible worlds there would be a more consistent presence of some good things like honesty, relationships, being nice, wisdom in witnessing events and understanding testimony, but if some people are trying hard to ensure other people don't become educated then we obviously have our work cut out for us.

I think the issue is that the difference between cranking out flaming leftists and treating racial and ethnic minorities respectfully is a beauty in the eye of the beholder problem.  Obviously OP thought being told that all white people are racists in denial of their own racism crossed the line.  I can see that.  I don't really understand why ""dude want's to be called she, weird, sure, but no skin off your back, so just roll with it"" would seem to fall into the same category.  Sort of off topic but I can't fathom what religious beliefs he thinks are violated here.  

&gt;Yeah and as I recall that was one of the cases that set out the ""incidental effect"" idea. The basic idea that religious belief doesn't exempt you from a neutral law that happens to effect one of your religious practices is a pretty sound one in my view.

I would have come down on the other side.  But I would do so under incidental effect as well as other standards.  These people have been using Peyote in religious ceremonies for longer than anyone remembers.  It's not incidental.  

What about say laws against Kosher slaughter on public health grounds?  

&gt;In the university setting, I believe it is essential for teachers to be respectful of their students. If you believe that your religion demands disrespect towards transgender or gay people, then you can't meet a basic requirement of the job. 

Seems like another gray area.  If the only thing Ronin did was refer to a transgendered student by their birth pronoun I would hope the student could just live with it.  Obviously I don't think it helps students to encourage them to have too thin of skin.  

&gt;It just rankles me a bit to see some people in this sub get so up in arms about, when in other contexts they tend to support the right of the employer to do whatever he wants. 

Yes, the contradiction is rather conspicuous.

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","Gaymers is great, but I have a couple of issues with it.  For one, I know that this isn't the intent, but the name pushes away the majority demographic.  Also, this might be an issue unique to me, but I don't like being defined by the fact that I'm transgender.  I am very open about it, and I do want to be accepted for it, but I don't want people to think of me as trans first, and being in a group like /r/gaymers just serves as a constant reminder to me of being trans.

Good article about internships at Disney World:

http://www.guernicamag.com/features/perlin_5_1_11/

Excerpt:
&gt; At Disney World, labor is meant to have an almost invisible quality. Except for the name tags, nothing distinguishes interns for the visitor; in certain parts of the park, at certain times of day, they comprise more than 50 percent of staff. Their work is identical to what permanent employees do, and there’s no added supervision, training, or mentoring on the job. The internship’s educational component is a three- or four-hour class each week, offering some of the easiest college credits in the land. Students are also encouraged to obtain credit through networking, distance learning, and “individualized learning opportunities.” Many interns do nothing scholastic, given that Disney doesn’t require it and that twelve-hour shifts are exhausting enough.","1380586515"

First, hospitals need to offer services to people.  JWs have every right to change their mind and get a blood transfusion at any time.  There may not be time to change insurance policies when the happens.

Second, it requires a personal decision with one's doctor be made in advance, with one's insurance agent.  As one's insurance policy is more readily accessible than one's conversation in a doctor's office, this raises privacy concerns.  Especially when insurance is through one's employer.

Third, it would drive up costs for others.  Let's say you're a young woman who gets a copper IUD.  You could save money by switching to a plan that doesn't cover contraception or abortion because you're all set for the next ten years.  But that would screw over the woman who goes vasovagal when anything enters her cervix, and has to shell out monthly for a NuvaRing.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Alright, well firstly this is a painting, not a photo.  It is explicitly meant to show the poor doomed Korean peasant bravely and unflinchingly being a heroic martyr to glorious Korea... Not giving American demon pigs the satisfaction of watching him scream.

Your other example of the Buddhist monk is more a test enemy to the power of the focused mind and the discipline of powerful meditation than of fire.  

Fire hurts.  Fire hurts worse than just about anything.  Touching any part of your body to a hot stove will show you just how awful that searing pain is, and how completely involuntary the minds response to being burned is.  You pull back, you yelp, you suck the spot that is burned, you glare angrily at the stove like this whole situation is its fault for touching you rather than the other way around.

It is true past the 2nd degree burn mark, the nerves themselves have been cooked and are no longer transmitting... So no pain received from them.  But even soaked in gasoline, that takes several seconds... Not to mention all the subdermal nerves that don't get immediately seared shut.  Being burned at the stakes a whole other sort... It's from the feet up, crawling slowly up the condemned's body, exposing each nerve in turn.  Long before they actually burn to death, the condemned are usually choked to death by the smoke.  Smoke is the real killer in a fire.

So suffice it to say, long story short... That guy is putting on a brave face because it's a propaganda painting, not because fire doesn't hurt like a sumbitch.","1380586520"

"DowntonAbbey","t5_2seky","/u/leakycauldron is in charge of traffic and has more mod experience than the rest of us combined. He's a moderator over at /r/gameofthrones, the largest sub for a TV show today, and many others. They follow the same strict guidelines and do just fine. People eventually find the links on their own, outside Reddit.

I really see what you're saying though, trust me. I'm American and I need roundabout methods to watch too. It's just that we're trying to make this sub better, get the traffic up, subscriber count up, participation up. If you look at almost every other TV sub, posting of these download/streaming links is prohibited. It's against Reddit's rules. I understand you when you want to just screw the rules and post them but we want to be a respectable sub, one that other subs will gladly advertise on their sidebars and bring more people to us. It is very easy to find links on Tumblr. There are people that post streaming and download links every week.

Also, it's undeniable how much the traffic numbers shoot up when the US airings come around. I know people grumble about different air dates for Downton and cite this as the reason links should be shared but it's true of nearly every show. Most American shows are broadcast here a long time before anywhere else and people in other countries complain as well. It's just not heard as much since it has always been that way. In fact, I hear most British people tell us to suck it up since they have to wait forever for our movies and TV shows to be released over there. :P

Sorry for this long post but I wanted to explain our side. It's not that we're being hardasses on purpose, I promise. It's a case of wanting to help but can't. I really do apologize that you're unhappy with it. I'm sure other people are too.","1380586520"

Now if it were fire that were involved, they'd know right away that it would be dangerous and they'd probably try to come up with ways for it not to be too bad to the person launching, but since fire wasn't a part of the equation, they glossed over the idea of there being a safety issue.

The Canadians found out immediately because the testimony (which was about general defense of the border, not about this scenerio) was not kept secret. They were offended and everyone agreed it was absurd. The plan never went ahead in any way.

First is enrichment. A commercial nuclear reactor can only have a maximum of 5% enriched fuel. In reality, only the new stuff is 5%, but you only refuel 1/3rd of the core at a time, so a commercial reactor is really loaded to about an average of 2.1-2.5%. The 5% limit is a legal one due to proliferation concerns. 

Naval reactors are anywhere from 20% to As high as weapons grade &gt;90%. Exact numbers vary by reactor, but the higher enrichment means that a naval sub with an equivalent number of fuel rods as a commercial reactor will have 20-30 times more fissionable fuel in them, which roughly means 20-30 times more energy available.

We could design commercial nuclear plants to operate that long, but no government in the world would license it.","1380586530"

They won't be *as* good as you are at vacuuming, but they generally get the job done. They also don't play well with persian rug-style carpets because of the amount of friction they have to fight against. Also, they can get tangled up in loose wires if you have those on the floor and you'll want to have your room be relatively open and without too many small nooks and crannies for it to get lost in. 

If the above isn't an issue for you, such as if you have hardwood/linoleum/vinyl etc floors, relatively large rooms and not too much clutter on ground level then it's a very nice thing to have around. Although it takes longer than you would to do its job and you still need clean it out every now and then the main benefit is that of convenience. You just set it on a schedule (for the models with such a feature) or start it when you're heading out or don't mind it nibbling at your toes and then go about your business.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Thanks iferted, that seems to be the rub.  I used to plan things for him, good kid stuff, but then he would want to hang around his mother, who lets him do that.  Then I started doing it only with my kids, and the three of them had a great relationship for a while, but my kids' misbehavior and shenanigans, and the increasing  hostility with which they and his mother treat each other, has now strained that.  But beyond that, now it's a situation where with the kids heading for the exit door, I'm wondering where to go with this.  

I'm ok with the relationship with him per se.  We are somewhat affectionate, he is very respectful to me. etc.  The problem is that I'm wondering how the heck the three of us do something that doesn't involve me being the butler.  It's not happening.  I think it'll get easier in about 5 years, but that's a long, long time.

"mwo","t5_2t1w0","Regarding the Blackjack, that's an alright build to start. I'd drop the small laser for more armor. With a 180 engine, you're not likely to get into the SL's 90m range, so you might as well ditch it. Try to hang back and let the heavies and assaults draw fire, then play peek-a-boo around your buddies and focus fire. Still, if anyone notices you, you're not likely to last long as you don't have the speed to run nor the armor to stand and fight, so always try to hide behind terrain or move with the rest of your company.

Unfortunately, the Raven-4X isn't all that good. If you want to stick with it, try to get the max engine (XL245) and endosteel for it. The higher speed will make you a little tougher to hit, but you're still going to be on the slow side compared to most light mechs. From there, you have a few options. Usually I see people try to use 1 or two big weapons on there, like a AC/10 or a PPC+SRM rack. Alternatively, stick with something similar to the base loadout, but swap in more ammo, heatsinks, and maybe AMS.

That said, XL+ES is pretty expensive just to make a subpar mech better. For a few more C-bills, you could get a better chassis like a Jenner or a Raven 3L.","1380586540"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;Maybe it would encourage them to pass fewer bills

Is this a joke? If anything, Congress has been criticized for inability to pass ANY legislation and Congressional gridlock.

&gt;On a similar note, it might encourage them to only have a single item per bill, rather than lumping a dozen different totally different issues into the same bill.

This makes no sense, why would you separate a bill into hundreds of smaller subsets?

Besides, the sheer volume of proposed bills that reach the house floor is staggering. It wouldn't matter if all the bills were even 10 pages long. No congressman would ever be able to personally read through all of them and make informed decisions on them without the help of aids.

Ultimate fares a little better, coming in at 38, with 46K readers.  By [July 2008](http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2008/2008-07.html) , Iron Man's first title has jumped to over 60K readers.  A year after the film, sales were still higher than before RDJ's performance, though it settled down around 53K.  Was Iron Man really that much more popular than Wonder Woman before the movie?  How much does readership count when three/four successful movies only drove up his sales by 10,000 since pre-movie?

If it is any indication of how the rest of this season will be, I will regretfully have to stop watching.  I know one viewer's opinions probably don't matter that much, but when a show with a concept I absolutely love causes me to physically cringe through half of the episode... I see it as a very bad sign.  

There wasn't a single moment in the premier to give me hope.  With the exception of Rumple's scenes with the Lost Boy, none of the actors were believable, and even Rumple's scenes were disappointing.  Sigh... I'm actually kinda angry because I was looking forward to this episode and the opportunity to support plot-driven television and I find that I can't.  It sucked.

I think the biggest problem (yes, bigger than the performance issues) is that the episode tried to follow too many stories.  We had Baelfire; The Anti-magic Brigade; Rumple; Henry and Pan (ugh); and the main cast.  The writers really-- desperately-- needed to stick to one or two stories, and left the others' actions to happen off camera or in future episodes.  Instead we're given this *trainwreck* of an episode with 5 different points of view, none of which work.

Ugh.  I feel like I'm already in mourning for the show.  Gawd I hope they tighten up in episode two....","1380586546"

She comes from a relatively wealthy family and is used to a high standard. Which also pisses me of.

Better to start a life together with a bit lower standard, than live in a toxic  enviroment.

But as i said, she wont leave till i get a job. I'm verry suspicious if she really intends to leave her mom even after i get one.

You definitely hit that one point correctly, if for a different reason. Now that he has the harem I don't find myself rooting for him as much as before when he was the loner. So it might not be a point of relating, but a question of having an underdog to root for. Then again it could be jealousy, once upon a time I almost acquired a harem but I was young and stupid.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Yes, it is biased.

&gt; penny arcade have created a hostile environment for girls in games

I would not say that's the case at all. I think some of PA's fans (note: a loud minority) have added hostility to the culture, but they were there before the instance and they will be there after we're all dead. The PA guys were largely fighting the assertion that they were ""Rape Apologists"", a title of which I actively disagree with as well. That fight got turned into an offensive weapon by this subset of their fanbase against the intention of the PA guys in order to attempt to make a hostile environment. It was certainly not PA's intention, and lessons were learned on both sides (hopefully). Firstly, just because someone mentions rape in a joke does not make them a rape apologist. Patton Oswalt had an interesting blog post on this as well, with regards to jokes which blame the victim or accept rape as a suitable outcome (which the PA joke was decidedly *not* doing). Secondly, the PA guys realized that they need to be very careful with how their messages may be re-appropriated or received. They've repeatedly claimed that they are not and never wished to be role models, though it is the case that no matter whether or not they want to be, they are, very similar to popular performers.

&gt;  But then they started trolling with the shirts. Its in bad taste and shows the worst part of internet culture.

As mentioned before, the initial targets of the shirts was those slinging mud at them claiming rape apology, which is indeed one of the worst parts of internet culture as well (the mud slinging). Their decision to sling back was certainly a bad decision, and one that they have apologized for on multiple occasions (including at the recent PAX Panel, though that was understandably somewhat ambiguous and could have been taken badly if not understood charitably until it was demystified after the fact).

&gt; They have done a lot of great things with childs play and all but any time the media reports on the good this will be noted and undermind their positives. 

The media reports on what will give them page views, not necessarily on what is the most correct or most unbiased version of events (either/or). Those that wish to hop onto the hate train will do so whether or not that train actually has any tracks and will hop to just about any they think will start moving.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't drink alcohol. 

The last time I drank alcohol I was at my friends 21st birthday party at a banquet hall. It was a grand setting, we were all dressed up in expensive suits looking real dapper. I had a $1250 custom suit on, so needless to say I was feeling fly as fuck. 

Anyway, this place had an open bar. It was the first time I ever been to a place with an open bar so I took advantage of that shit. Gin and tonic, gin and tonic, gin and tonic, Heineken x4, you get the picture. By the time dinner time came around I was the only one out of the group of friends I came with who was completely plastered. The dinner looked SO GOOD and I was starving. I remember telling my friend ""Yo, fix me a plate. I'm gonna go take a piss."" But I walked out of the banquet hall, sat in the back seat of my car thinking ""Oh my god I drank way too much. Let me get some air for 10 minutes and I'm going right back to that barbecue stake!"" 

I never got to that stake. I passed the fuck out for maybe 3-4 hours. By the time I woke up and went back inside, all my friends were drunk, full from a very nice dinner while I was feeling broken, hungover and hungry. ""Hey man were the hell were you?!"" I didn't even feel like answering, I just felt bad. 

Luckily, there was a poutine shop across the street. I went there. It didn't even taste good.

The hit you get is dependent on the voltage drop (how much of the voltage gets sent to the coil) of the mod, the resistance of the coil, and the charge of the battery.

story:
gave my friend $20 for some...medicine (depression and anxiety so it really is medicine for me) didn't come through he sat on my 20 for a week next Tuesday we were at breakfast and he told me he is giving the money to his friend for some train wreck. OK sweet i had some extra cash on me at the time and pitched in an extra $20 so now he has $40 and im expecting 2gs he even said that's how much i would get. another week passes HE gets it on Monday and forgets it on Tuesday he brings it in on Wednesday. its the wrong stuff...i was pissed. we talked on skype and i ask him about the other stuff he said its better than the trainwreck and hits you harder...he said he'll give me a ""G"" of the mystery strain and a ""G"" of trainwreck. he sais since its my first time buying he'll make it heavy. he then brings it in on Thursday and didn't have a chance to look at it while we were still together and stashed it in my car. i get to the car and open it up (it was in a deodorant bottle/can) and it looked really small. thinking it was dense i let it go. the idea was in my head though that it wasn't dense and i just got ripped off, by my best friend. get home after stressful day at school thinking i will make a jail scale and try to weigh it. its about 2-3gs WITH THE BAG i take it out and its a heavy G (probably 1.2) pissed as hell. grinder got delivered the next day MFLB got delivered the day after that. so its not all bad (two sad excuses for nugs about as big as the middle section of your ring finger)

If you're using VMWare pre 5.x, this was even more of an issue with being careful with vCPU configurations - it's gotten better in 5.x, but still not as efficient as some of the competition.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Just to add: In Asian collectivist cultures, it's more accepted for girls to be overtly hypergamous (gold-diggers). At least in Korea, it's immediately put out there verbally by women when talking about ""ideal"" mates. They want a rich guy and they let you know.  I tend to think that it's a cycle: Increased hypergamy causes increased femininity (submissiveness to men), which increases hypergamy, and so on. 

Also, In my experiences dating Singapore, Thai, Philippine, Chinese women...they are also overt in their intentions that a tall/rich guy who is ""kind"" is the ideal. This is anecdotal, but I've noticed the one thing that Asian women hate is a ""rich"", high status guy who is ""cheap"" and refuses to share his ""wealth"" or status after they have sex with him (aka they become entitled to it). I've had lots of experiences where SE Asian women think I'm some high status, sex master then later on go on to *hate* me with a passion &amp; call me a player because I wouldn't provide for them after we had sex. In other words, SE Asian women are well-versed that sex is *required* to get a man, but when they fail to get their man/target, they really hate that guy. It's as if some sacred pact (sex in exchange for money) has been violated. 

I have also noticed that exposure to western feminism in Korea has had more relationship-related effects: Kgirls now feel even more license to demand money/women-only subway cars/women-only library hours, etc...because ""that's the way foreigners do it"".

"Watches","t5_2qls5","Jewelry stores are hit and miss. Most of them can do simple things like band sizing and battery replacement, but beyond that most will either decline or have to send the work out. Very few have watchmakers on staff. You'll want to find someone who will work on vintage watches obviously, many jewelry stores will only work on watches still in production or that they sell. So, hunt out a watchmaker if at all possible.

You'll probably just need to tell a watchmaker you recently bought it and want it checked out and serviced. They'll be able to see what needs work without you telling them. 

With the regulator that far out and the hairspring out of center it's very likely going to run erratically. Dial up it may keep time OK, dial down it may be out a few minutes, vertically in different positions it may run different rates as well. It's impossible to say how it will run just from a picture, but the hairspring being flat and centered is essential to the watch keeping isochronous time- the same rate regardless of position.

The tee is what's really holding this outfit down. It's too big. The seams of the tee's shoulders are practically falling off your real shoulders. Also, all the bunching of the tee at the bottom suggests to me that it could go all the way down over your zipper, which would make it too long.

Honestly, you're just a slimmer fitting tee away from looking way better.

"canada","t5_2qh68","So you respect it then? Because someone CAN be discriminated against for being white; just because it may not be common or likely to happen to any given individual, does not mean it does not happen to SOME.

Equating the men's rights movement to anti-white discrimination, though, leads me to believe you aren't interested in examining facts or viewpoints that do not coincide with your own, as you appear to simply disregard these without care. Far be it for me to try to explain to someone who's willfully ignorant.

On the off chance your comment was not meant as an ignorant insult but was actually based out of simply not knowing better, though, feel free to investigate both issues thoroughly, and perhaps to even try to engage in open conversation. I think you'd find that just because some groups may have more and/or more obvious advantages, does not mean they cannot have disadvantages, or that they cannot be discriminated against in some ways while discriminating against others in other ways.

The world is not black or white, and the men's issues deserve respect and discussion - and yes, safe spaces - as much as women's issues, race issues, class issues. It's not supposed to be a competition of who has it worst; we should acknowledge all issues on the basis that they are issues, not discount them on the basis that someone has some other, possibly worse issue.","1380586565"

Speaking of, this is the first time I haven't had super intense cravings during this time of the month, so I think it must have something to do with the intermittent fasting. I'm not complaining!

Moving forward I hope I can stick to IF, because it's really working for me. I only have a few pounds to lose, and eating at a big enough deficit to see results and stay motivated is very, very hard. With IF, I feel like I have so many calories to work with that sticking to my limit isn't as challenging. I also hope to hit the gym 4 times (1 down- brutal spin class today!) :D

http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/57/5/772S.short

The problem with this line of thinking is that the comparison is usually the satiety of fat + protein vs. carbs alone.  Like saying that a steak fills you up more than a bowl of rice, therefore ""fat and protein are more satiating.""  No, the protein was more satiating, and that's not a good way to tell how filling the fat component actually was.  The actual test would be (protein + fat) vs. (protein vs. carbs).  In that context, where protein is otherwise equal, I am aware of no evidence that indicates fat is more filling than carbohydrate.  If anything, it's probably less satiating.","1380586567"

They all go there seperate ways and ave the midling solo careers of jobbers, except for Drew who winds up finding himself in the hunt for the IC title.

Meanwhile, Sheamus turns vicious, kicking people in the head like he did to Jamie Noble when he debuted, all making vague references to having some new trainer and new friends, that like him, LOVE to fight and hurt people.

Turns out Sheamus has allied himself with Wade Barret, and they are both taking order from a mystery man.

Drew is in a match for the IC title against Christian (In Canada). Christian is making his normal end of match comeback, when all of a sudden, Barret and Sheamus come down and lay him out.

While Sheamus, Wade and Drew are laying the beat down on Christian, Regal comes out, cuts a promo about how Canada is a failure as a country and should be nothing more than part of the British Empire, a slave to the United Kingdom, which is what this group starts calling themselves.

They go on a huge British nationalist gimmick (With Sheamus claiming to live in belfast now, and deciding that ALL of ireland should rejoin the crown). Barret wins the US championship at a ppv. The next night on Raw, the UK throws the US championship in the trash and reveals the European championship. As they douse the trashcan with gas, dump a flag in and are about to light it up,

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I respectfully disagree with your assessment of Mormonism. I can understand why you think that those particular qualities might be found in Mormonism, but I think that betrays a shallow understanding of Mormons. 

While the details of the LDS temple are kept private, the teachings inside are no different from those outside and available to any visitor. If Mormons are trying to keep secrets, sending missionaries door to door is a pretty weird way of doing it. 
As a Mormon who has ""left the group"" and returned to it a time or two, I can happily verify that I was never shunned or castigated, never disowned nor victim to litigation, violence, or threats. 

Mormons do teach the Law of Tithing, as do many other churches, using the Bible as the foundation for the instruction. The LDS Church also encourages members to make donations and impart of their income for the care of the poor, the sustenance of missionaries, the publication of materials, and the general building up of the LDS Church. These practices seem to be a common feature in various churches. As such, I wouldn't consider this ""inordinately concerned"" with financial contributions, but you are free to disagree. 

Don't most religions emphasize the wisdom, knowledge and in some cases, power of a great leader? Don't these leaders tend to contradict mainstream beliefs? Why would anyone follow a leader that has no wisdom to impart nor teaching regarding to how to improve on the status quo? How does one verify wisdom? 
I suppose Mormons do emphasize the wisdom, knowledge and powers of Christ, which many people deem to be unverifiable. I suppose we ""emphasize"" the wisdom, knowledge and powers of the prophets and apostles of Christ, as well. We believe in modern prophets who operate in the same capacity as the prophets and apostles of old. But if the purpose of this criteria is to say that a ""cult"" does so in a manner that is disproportionate or tantamount to worship, I would argue that Mormons don't fit the bill (Christ being the obvious exception, who we do, in fact, worship).

You shouldn't always counter jungle. Or, well, if you know what you're doing and are quite sure you can win it will probably help you. It is not necessary to win the game and it can backfire horribly if you do it wrongly. So make sure you know you can dual their jungler or outrun them. Then go for it if you feel comfortable.

Last hitting practice usually works best in a custom game where it's just you. A little over 100 minions enter mid lane the first ten minutes. Start of with your regular runes and starting items and try to not use any spells while farming at first. If this gets easy (let's say, 60 farm at least, preferably more) add a bot and farm that way. Then after that you can ask people to 1v1 you etc.

Practicing your mechanics is really only actually possible in actual games. Play one champ a lot and learn how their match ups work etc. For new champs you can go into a bot game if you like to figure them out a bit but that usually won't be enough.

"LoLChampConcepts","t5_2t7e7","I'm sorry this is so long.

**TL;DR**: Champions like the one you're proposing are difficult to design well, for a variety of reasons. It is possible that it can be done well, but there are some principles that must be abided by. 

---
**Reference**
___
So, there is a concept a lot like this in DotA's Invoker, and it brings up some issues that arise when trying to implement Invoker-style mechanics in League. 

Invoker works, in a very basic summary, by using three basic abilities in succession and then pressing an activation button. The activation button generates an effect based upon the order of the last three abilities used. This gives Invoker ten ""chord"" abilities, and four basic abilities (the three fundamentals and the activation). More information can be found [here](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invoker). 

Your champion would have, if I understand, four basic abilities, with the option of chaining together any two or more to create an effect. I am assuming that the champion is not going to have an activation button, like Invoker does. I am also assuming that the order in which the abilities are activated matters (e.g., EW has a different effect than WE). Also, I am assuming that your champion can make chords with the same ""notes' (e.g., QQ works to create an additional effect).

If those are all true, then your champion has access to 16 abilities, not counting non-chord abilities. If we could those (e.g., just using Q), that number goes up to 20. 

That is a lot. 

If your champion has an activation button that does nothing else than make the chord happen, that number goes down to 9. If we include non-chord abilities, it goes up to 12. If your champion cannot press the same button twice to make a chord, the number goes down further.. 

Point being that, in most cases, your champion will have more abilities than dual-stance champions (Jayce, Elise, Nidalee, even Lee Sin). Those champions all have seven abilities, at maximum. This can be very problematic, though not necessarily. 

___
**Versatility and Accessibility**
___

Why is this problematic? Versatility can be very confusing. It's very good, for some champions, to be versatile. But with versatility, there has to come a certain degree of accessibility, or the ability of someone to look at a champion and think ""Okay, I've got a fairly good idea of what I'm supposed to do here.""

Accessibility means more than just ""I should press Q and E to get this effect."" It also means that:

* the reader is able to have a general understanding of what statistic to build (e.g., Veigar clearly scales really well off of AP), 
* what role the champion plays (e.g., Vayne very clearly is made to play AD Carry; Zyra is very clearly capable of being AP Carry or Support, but rarely tank), 
* and how they're supposed to go about performing those roles (Vayne is supposed to single out one person judging by her Silver Bolts; Zyra is supposed to use her plants to keep enemies busy). 

Additionally, accessibility allows people playing the champion *and* people playing against the champion to know whether they're doing a good job. As Veigar, I know I'm doing a good job if I land my stun and blast the shit out of some poor bastard. As someone playing against Veigar, I know I'm doing a good job if I avoid the stun and kill the squishy little guy. Veigar's threat is clearly indicated through his gameplay, and this allows both teams to know what a ""good"" play is.

And, lastly for our purposes here, there is the issue of a ""clutch"" play. Many champions, increasingly so as we move further away from the first batch of champions put out at release, have a palpable moment in which the player feels really, really impactful. Sona saving her carry's life and turning the tide of a teamfight by stunning all 5 members of the enemy team. LeBlanc blasting down a carry in the back-line and getting away scratch-free. Olaf running train all over the enemy team to kill their carry without a care in the world. These moments feel really good, and are what motivate people to play.

___
**Why is Accessibility an Issue Here?**
___
With a champion as versatile as you're implying, there are going to be some problems with accessibility. These aren't necessarily insurmountable, but they are worth talking about. Some main questions potential players will have with so versatile a champion is:

* What do I build? 
* What is my role?
* How do I know I'm doing my job?
* What do I do to get that ""clutch"" moment?

If these are clear and your champion is coherent, great. If not, not great. With more abilities, that level of accessibility gets harder and harder to obtain. Why? There's more to read, more to think about, more to remember in the heat of the moment. 

In sociology, there is a term (coined by Durkheim) called ""anomie."" This is, basically, an excess of choice. There are too many options to pick from, and as a result, there is no clear ""should."" Only ""could."" For a champion with nine abilities or more, it becomes harder for me to identify what I ""should"" do in a certain situation, among all of the things I ""could"" do. And then, of course, this decision has to be made in the split-second time frame that most decisions are made in League. 

The same is true for the enemy team. Against a champion with so many ""coulds,"" what ""should"" I do? If this is clear, great. If not, there are some problems. 

___
**Conclusion**
___
I don't want to discourage you. I would love to see a champion like this be successfully made. And, among the talent in the subreddit, it's a definite possibility. But it is quite difficult to do it well. If you follow the guideline of ""accessibility"" and [read up on Riot's design philosophy](http://www.reddit.com/r/LoLChampConcepts/comments/phyzv/riotstyled_guidelines_for_creating_champions/) this could be an amazing champion.

And?  So their BELIEF has increased?  That isn't exactly surprising, nor is it based in objective science.

As [Peter Lilley noted](http://www.cityam.com/article/1380507150/global-warming-alarmism-no-longer-scientifically-or-politically-sustainable):

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, **when doomsday forecasts fail, cult supporters don't immediately give up.** A US social scientist infiltrated a cult whose leader predicted the apocalypse would arrive on 21 December, as would a flying saucer to save her followers. When neither came on the appointed day, **most of her followers, far from abandoning the cult, accepted their leader's message that doom had been postponed and became even more fanatical.** 

Warming &amp; environmentalism is a CULT -- a modern quasi-pseudo-religion that people are indoctrinated into and fervently BELIEVE in -- it is not a science based on objective observable reality.

So when their prophecies fail, we should fully EXPECT that the ""believers"" will *double down* on their certainty -- in defiance of the evidence.","1380586588"

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","At least you asked... most people that follow this line of thought just bait their entire team. I.e. they won't even try taking a shot in an even 50/50 firefight.

As a whole, I don't agree with the statement ISleepTheDayAway made.

It's a game of give and take. To figure out where the enemies are SOMEONE has to make the first peak. This allows your teammates to know where the guy is hiding and shooting from. If you're by yourself, this strategy totally changes and obviously won't work. 

But if you're with a teammate, you're gonna want to have one person peak and move to cover, meanwhile the second guy is pre-aiming and fires while the enemy is distracted trying to shoot your teammate as he's taking cover/firing back. It's like a crossfire, the enemy gets trapped trying to shoot both people.

As the first guy gets to cover, the second guy should move out into the open more to find and move to the next place to take cover, at which point the first guy that peaked and ran out is done reloading. This is when the first guy that peaked runs out while the enemies are trying to shoot the now front guy.

It's a game of give and take. I wish more people would realize that baiting is a good strategy if everyone involved is on the same page. This leap frog strategy that I just explained is one of the hundreds of ways you can stay alive while getting frags.

Frags are important. They're more important than staying alive when the rest of your team is dying.","1380586589"

(not a gearhead, answering from a general understanding of how motors work from engineering classes)

A backfire is going to work counter to the direction the motor should be spinning.  Also running counter to the direction the motor should be spinning is the friction you are trying to overcome when you turn the crank.

I suppose you could have a mechanism that keeps the crank from ever turning in the wrong direction, but then you'd have the motor fighting some kind of mechanical lock.  This would probably lock up the engine or break the ratchet.  

I'm not sure how often backfiring happened back then, but I'm betting often enough that it was better to crank carefully to prevent a broken arm than it was to possibly break the engine every time.","1380586595"

"keto","t5_2rske","Fructose is metabolized primarily by the liver, and will get turned into liver glycogen which will prevent ketosis. So fruits might be the best option, or anything with sugar. You can also try eating more protein as excess protein is converted to glucose ([at 58% efficiency](http://books.google.com/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;ots=dNISh1zQJz&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), so you'll probably need quite a bit of it).

Your liver usually only holds 12-16 hours worth of glucose (glycogen), after that it'll start to produce ketones.

&gt; The major determinant of whether the liver will produce ketone bodies is the amount of liver glycogen present (8). The primary role of liver glycogen is to maintain normal blood glucose levels. When dietary carbohydrates are removed from the diet and blood glucose falls, glucagon signals the liver to break down its glycogen stores to glucose which is released into the bloodstream. After approximately 12-16 hours, depending on activity, liver glycogen is almost completely depleted. At this time, ketogenesis increases rapidly. In fact, after liver glycogen is depleted, the availability of FFA will determine the rate of ketone production. (12)

[""The Ketogenic Diet""](http://books.google.com/books?id=JtCZBe-2XVIC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;ots=dNIRd8FTFA&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), by Lyle McDonald, page 30.

People who do a cyclic ketogenic diet usually drop out of ketosis for a day or two in set intervals (like once  week, or once every two weeks), depending on the intensity of their exercise. Check out /r/ketogains.","1380586602"

Just as a heads up because you mention your fiancee, this may become much worse once you are married. Your mom sounds controlling and if so, she will want to test your allegiance: her or your wife.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Personally, I have no problem being charged money for electricity I purchase; no problem at all.

What I do have a problem with is when the utility won't tell you how certain portions of your bill are calculated.

Most of my bill is fairly easy to read; you have your regular per-kilowatt charges, various fees and taxes, etc. All normal, all easy to figure out.

But I have one charge on my bill, that I can never figure out - and no one from our electric company (APS out here in AZ) can tell us how it is calculated.

It's titled ""Demand Charge on-peak - generation"" - I'm looking at an old bill right now from 2012; the total bill was $174.00 - that particular fee or whatnot was $48.00 of the total! And it isn't the same as ""Generation of electricity on-peak"" - that was about $13.00.

That particular fee fluctuates with the on-peak usage, but it isn't in any linear or other method I've been able to figure out. Nothing on the web site tells how it is calculated, and nobody at the billing office can tell us how it is calculated.

Basically - my only problem is when a company doesn't give you all the formula's and such needed to tell you how to get from your total used kWh (or a per-day breakdown) to the bill in your hand. You should be able to calculate this on a piece of paper with some fairly rudimentary math. Most of it you can calculate - but there are portions which just seem made up, and nobody can tell you how to get from A to B.

That's what pisses me off.

But then - there are one or two charges (which tend to be a pretty large portion of the overall bill)","1380586602"

While I know some authors have experienced this, I also know for a fact that there are TONS of literary agents, editors, and publishers out there who are not only extremely accepting of LGBT stories, they are actively seeking them out.

If your book has an LGBTQ main character or love story, just say it. ""While she's fighting the evil vampire queen, Sarah falls in love with her classmate, Jane."" Or ""Joe and his boyfriend Steve want to start the most badass rock band ever seen in Columbus, Ohio.""

If the agent/editor reads your manuscript or query and decides the LGBT character/story line isn't right for them, YOU DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH THAT AGENT/EDITOR. You want someone who's going to advocate for your work, who gets who you are, and who 100% supports LGBT stories. If they don't, they're doing you a favor by rejecting you. You should then go find someone who does support your story. They're out there, I promise you.","1380586608"

If you look, almost every place where there is a lot of violence/crime, there is a majority of blacks. Even in America, the worst violent, crime ridden cities are populated by a majority of blacks.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Here's my two cents...

First, if he's feeling like there's no stability in his life, he may be lying as a self-preservation mechanic. He doesn't want to admit that he doesn't know something, so he makes a story up. It makes him stronger to have the answers, but the strength is fake, which is why he gets so defensive when his lies are called on.

He is afraid. He's afraid of doing the wrong thing, or of not knowing what he's doing, or if he does screw up that everyone will know. He's pretending to be okay, but inside he's really scared, and he doesn't think very much of himself.

He needs a thousand hugs, and he needs to know that he is safe. He needs to know what's going on, and he needs to know that it's okay that he doesn't know everything. He needs to know that it's okay to be scared, and that he will do okay because he is strong enough. He needs to know that he is loved, and that he is believed in, and that he's doing a good job with everything he's going through, and mostly he needs to know that he's not alone, even if it feels that way.

The lying is a secondary effect. Aim instead at the primary problems. Give him time, and be strong for him.

Again, just my two cents. I went through something very similar as a kid.","1380586608"

I'm not sure if they had any caming effect that would allow for more storage upfront, and some letoff further in the draw- I would have to review some books there. My guess is the one in the picture was designed that way because it looked cool. To me it appears that all the limbs are bolted on laminates. The ones on the front are fine, they attach to the riser and are pulled against it when drawn, but the ones on the back look like they'd be pulled against the bolts, which would concentrate stress.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","One thing I remember reading years ago is about the strength of the signals from your nerves determining a large portion of your muscle strength.

The more you exercise, not only do you make your actual muscles stronger, but you also (through repetition) make your nerves more proficient at sending the signals to your muscles.

I recall reading that, for examples, marathon runners frequently have freakishly strong upper bodies, compared to what you would expect for someone of their muscle mass. That is a result of so many repetitions of muscle movements that has made their nerves more effective. The article I read even said that running makes your leg muscles and nerves stronger, but additionally it makes your spinal nerves more effective too. So other parts of you body become stronger from exercising your legs, simply because your brain and spinal cord are better at sending the signals.

Then I remember that we had a marathon runner in our high school. The guy had ridiculously strong arms, even though he was skinny as a toothpick. He looked anorexic, but he could easily win an arm wrestling match against our varsity football players.

Now admittedly, our football team was not very good. I also understand that ""arm wrestling"" isn't the same weight lifting for example. But note that I am not saying that he was able to hold off a football player (hold still and not lose) until he got tired and then win. He would easily and quickly take down the arm of even our offensive lineman.

I don't have a reference for the article I read 15 years ago and my personal experience is anecdotal. ","1380586613"

**MVP vs. EoT**

[MVP Dotabuff](http://dotabuff.com/teams/882084)

[EoT Dotabuff](http://dotabuff.com/teams/737695)

MVP did 1-0 Symphony in the NSL on Friday, but I didn't watch the VODs to know how well they did.

[EoT](http://www.joindota.com/en/edb/team/3123-team-eot) were the runner-ups in the first season in the NSL, but it looks like they might have had a roster change, or different aliases? This [was their roster](http://www.joindota.com/en/matches/67899-fxopen-vs-team-eot) in the first NSL. The EoT dotabuff profiles have two of them put on private too, which makes it hard to know what is going to happen.

**ACE.online vs. UR**

UR 1-0'd NJ&amp;Kids in a pretty convincing manner on the 28th, and are thus favourites for this match up.

[Ace online's dotabuff](http://dotabuff.com/teams/741863) have 3 of their profiles hidden. Singspiel and Hoon are ~50% players in pubs, and are looking like a new team for the NSL.

These are very unreliable bets, I wouldn't bet big but I will bet on the favourites UR here due to their performance.

**GxGaming vs. Imp**

[GxGaming](http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/2505-gest-september-2013/matches/27963-gxgaming-brutal-vs-team-impervious) seems to have recently lost to 0-1 to 1st.VN an Dreamz, but also did beat 1st.VN 1-0. I have not watched games to know how good they are. In those last three games, GxGaming had an alleged stand-in for their mid player, so perhaps they have an inconsistent roster.

Imp on the other hand have beaten Mineski 3-1, 2-0, but also lost 0-1 to them. Imp also beat DreamZ 2-1, but lost 0-1 to Lowyat. You essentially have a B-tier SEA team versus a lower-ranked in my opinion SEA team. It is a BO3 as well so hopefully they don't get stomped as a result.

**FXO vs. S1**

FXO were the champions of the first NSL season, 3-0'ing EoT. [FXO's Dotabuff profiles](http://dotabuff.com/teams/498033). No one is below 60% and one guy is 70% on their profiles. They are clear favourites for a reason here.

[Season One_](http://dotabuff.com/teams/944236) are mid-low 50% players on Dotabuff, and are going to be unknown versus FXO. With no games officially under their belt I would bet on FXO here.

**Pacific vs. MiTH**

MiTH recently have gone 1-2 versus Mineski, 1-0 to DreamZ, 1-0 to Mineski, 1-0 to Awake, and 1-0 to MSiEvoGT. MiTH are one of the better-known SEA teams and for good reason since they can usually beat most of the other teams, and unlike a lot of SEA teams have a stable roster (i.e. no stand-ins). [Pacific] on the other hand have beaten For.Love 1-0, 0-1 to Mineski, and lost to a slew of C-Tier Asian teams. It also looks like their last tracked game on Gosugamers was in April, so the roster that shows up for this match might be totally unknown to everyone. However, this is a BO3 and I would favour MiTH to take this.

**Na'Vi vs. Fnatic.eu**

I did not watch NaVi play today, but [they did 2-0 4FC](http://www.joindota.com/en/matches/81851-natus-vincere-vs-4-friends-chrillee). 4FC also had Jussi as their standin player, but NaVi beating 4FC should not be a big surprise. The last time NaVi and Fnatic fought was in Starladder where Era went on vacation and Fnatic thought they were going to lose anyways and picked Meepo. Prior to that Fnatic beat NaVi in the TI3 group stages. In a BO3, I would give it to NaVi to win over Fnatic who could possibly do a dumb draft, but NaVi could also do something dumb. Rough either way, but if both teams play properly naVi should win.

**One.dota vs. 4FC**

ONE played versus Fnatic today, and though they had their moments Fnatic absolutely outclassed them. I don't 4FC should be favoured so heavily in this match up. [4FC](http://www.joindota.com/en/edb/team/449-4-friends-chrillee) did however beat RS.int in an upset on Sunday, yet again showing inconsistency and the ability to pull off upsets. It is also very possible they have a standin again for this match up. [ONE](http://www.joindota.com/en/edb/team/3745-one) did pull an upset over Fnatic on the 9th, but have been losing since to B-tier teams. I would favour 4FC to take this, but their inconsistency worries me. They are probably the more skilled team and I'd hope in a BO3 they should take this. I wouldn't put rares on them here though with these odds.","1380586619"

"anime","t5_2qh22","S1+S2 covered 1-13 and SS1, so they'd have to adapt 14-22 and SS2.
Seeing as SS2 is more than skip-able/OVA-able (it basically has nothing important to the story, unlike SS1), that leaves 9 volumes.

S1 and S2 covered 7 volumes each, so I don't think it's that unlikely to happen, nor is it that hard to achieve. Hell, TWGOK adapted content equivalent to *both* previous seasons (each of them 1-cour, so almost 2-cour worth) into a *single* cour for S3, and it wasn't that bad - the second half and the ending was spectacularly well adapted and in my opinion even topped the original work, and the first half, while not great due to a lot of modifications, was more than enjoyable.

I agree that it'd probably be better to adapt 14-22 as 3-cour (2 seasons?) since the last few arcs are pretty big, but seeing as the last arcs all build up to a climax in the last 3 volumes (the last arc), I don't really see where they could easily stop a 2-cour season.

I also think doing a third season without the last arc would be like having S3 of TWGOK not cover the goddess arc. It'd just ""miss"" a lot of what makes the franchise *awesome* and what is by far the best arc, seeing as it'd take a while for a fourth season to come out (in TWGOK's case, it most likely wouldn't have).","1380586619"

I'm not sure what you're responding to, tbh. Did I say that feminism was all about dealing with the MRA, or that the MRA had wide institutional power? I believe what I said was that this particular article does a good job of rebutting an MRA talking point that I've seen parroted. 

However, I do not agree that the MRA is simply a sad, powerless band of misfits. I think any woman that has been harassed by them, or, like me, has been dedicated to a subculture that the MRA has been making inroads into can tell you that they might be small but their power depends on an uninformed, and/or grossly privileged, patriarchy that is pushing back hard against feminism. They might not have institutional power, but they do possess rhetorical power and I think we feminists ignore that at our peril (and most especially at the peril of our sisters and brothers,  who's lives these shitheels zealously destroy.)

"technology","t5_2qh16","Inductive charging for electric vehicles is clearly a huge game changer which will inevitably become a global standard but it doesn't surprise me that this is not Google's emphasis. Roads and electrical transmission lines are natural monopolies. It cannot make sense to expect competition through multiple redundant systems in the case of natural monopolies. That makes no sense and will never happen. Until we are politically able to elect governments that are willing to take leadership roles in bringing next generation technology to these natural monopolies, there is no point in private companies taking an advocacy role. 

So Google is focused on applications of technology in places where they can make a difference. Yes, inductive charging is a very, very good idea but expecting Google to make it happen is perhaps expecting a bit much. 

As for the government. Well, we've got some self-inflicted structural problems in the political system that make it hard to get traction. I'm not referring to partisan bickering as much as physical systemic issues. The Senate gives disproportionate representation to rural states where vast numbers of constituents live at the end of long circuits of unpaved roads. It wouldn't really make sense to place inductive charging systems into rarely-used county-maintained dirt roads. But in the US, we've got a system that puts those constituents into an exceptionally powerful position. 

This could logically be overcome with sensible decisions on what levels of traffic would justify inductive charging systems but while we're waiting for sensible decisions to come from our government, we might as well get started on autonomous electric vehicles with large batteries which seems to be where Google is heading. If inductive charging eventually gets some traction in  government then all the pieces will be in place for a huge transition to low-cost autonomous electric transportation.","1380586620"

He wasn't particularly keen on freedom of conscience, and his intervention in Germany prolonged the Thirty Years War - the most destructive war in European History until WWII - for its final twenty years.

His tactical influence is overstated by gushing reviews from his place on all staff college curricula. His (more flexible) tactics were simply the application of tactics developed to fight the Poles (who fought as exceptionally manoeuvrable raiders) in Germany, and he sometimes slipped into unimaginative approaches when he was careless, most famously at Lutzen.","1380586623"

"photocritique","t5_2qymy","Here are my thoughts:

Black Background: Is it supposed to be black? Because currently its a mess of black and grey. (easy fixes: bringing the blacks in using Levels or curves. Or Manually painting it using the burn tool set to shadows on a low opacity with ""protect tones"" turned off)

Actors Head shots: If this is aimed at an actor then I don't think the composition works so well. The way its on the side takes focus away from the subject. In a lot of headshot photography its all about the actor and their expression, this seems to be focused too much on the background and your name in the corner. (also quick googling shows that 90% is usually orientated portrait, I think thats so actors can easily attach a print to their CV) 

Lighting: I quite like the light on his face. However I don't think there is enough separation between him and the background. Also I think you've used a much too slow shutter-speed, Was there a benefit or necessity to using such a slow shutter? I think it may be what's caused a slightly out of focus look to the whole image, that or your aperture. Why go down so low?

One last thing (I am aware I have been rather negative, I'm sorry about that) In this shot he has a bit of a double chin, this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe3oJnFtA_k has helped me a lot in terms of shooting head shots :) )","1380586624"

Fast forward about 10 years, and I'm living in my first apartment.  My roommate's fiance (who also lived there, but this makes it easier to differentiate who's who) threw constant parties.  There were always people in the house.  I found this to be a great game - who's going to be in my living room when I get home?  No one ever went upstairs where my bedroom was (and my door had a lock on it), so random houseguests were just fun.   So anyway, one day I come home from work to find one of those very bully guys sitting on the couch.  Another was further into the room talking to my roommate's fiance, and a third was in the kitchen with a beer in his hand.  Apparently they were all good friends.  I just nodded to them and went upstairs.  

They were relatively frequent guests from then on, and it was weird for a while.  None of us mentioned any of our past history, and they were all polite enough because they were in my house.  Over time a couple showed that they had grown up, and we started enjoying each other's company.  The others remained idiots, and I took great delight in subtly being a bitch in ways they couldn't do a thing about, as a guest in my home.

Fast forward another 10 years, and I couldn't possibly care less.  It has had no lasting effect on me at all.","1380586628"

If they're considering not giving things to this brother because he won't come back, then they're just as entitled to skip you because you don't want kids.

&gt; My little sister has always had a tendency to ruin things. She can't keep them nice. She is a hoarder and everything just gets gross.

But honestly, that's not the best reason why she should be 'skipped over' either.  If your parents want to give things away then it's their business as to who they give them to, and she is allowed to horde them or 'get them gross'.

&gt; Uninsured Americans are less likely to have regular health care and use preventive services. **They are more likely to delay seeking care, resulting in more medical crises, which are more expensive than ongoing treatment for such conditions as diabetes and high blood pressure.** A 2007 study published in JAMA concluded that uninsured people were less likely than the insured to receive any medical care after an accidental injury or the onset of a new chronic condition. The uninsured with an injury were also twice as likely as those with insurance to have received none of the recommended follow-up care, and a similar pattern held for those with a new chronic condition.[78] **Uninsured patients are twice as likely to visit hospital emergency rooms as those with insurance; burdening a system meant for true emergencies with less-urgent care needs.**[79]

&gt; In 2008 researchers with the American Cancer Society found that individuals who lacked private insurance (including those covered by Medicaid) were more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage cancer than those who had such insurance.[80]

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","I would have to strongly disagree with your post.  The idea is to connect with women as objects SEXUALLY and not COMPULSIVELY.  Too many guys think that fapping to porn is about releasing ""sexually"".  This is no more true than an obese person seeing food as a way to ""satisfy hunger"".  The natural drives have been hijacked.  The idea is to become sexual instead of compulsive.  To unwire shame from the idea of seeing women as sexual objects.  For men, our first and most powerful impulse regarding a woman who is sexually attractive is to see her as a sexual object.  To view her femininity through that lense.  If we don't learn how to do that without shame ( compulsion), we're condemned to believe that we're somehow ""bad"" for being men.  What percentage of this sub is male?  Why is that?  Men are VISUAL when it comes to women.  Women lose all respect for men who think it's ""shallow"" to see them ""just"" for sex.  How could they respect a man who demonizes his own sexuality and thinks it's an UPGRADE to de-gender women and see them as ""people"" and then ""throw in"" the truth once everyone's ""comfortable"" with removing the male from the equation.  No relationship could ever be built out of such fundamental dishonesty and low self esteem.","1380586631"

I still like the overall feeling of the class, every spec plays like it's a unique, seperate class all together.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","Well, there are a couple of dimensions to this, but the basic process should come rather automatically for an INTP.

One dimension of this process is the logic behind *when* to switch to the more 'mathematical' truth evaluation mode, but that should be straight forward enough: just use it everywhere it makes sense to. And no, I don't mean that as a synonym for ""when you feel like it"", I literally mean ""where it makes *sense*"". Like how I was talking about art in my previous comment, clearly 'true'/'false' don't have much meaning there (at a conscious/superficial level anyway), so don't worry about it there.

If you struggle with when to use it in ""what is the meaning of life?"" types of questions, then again, that situation doesn't make total sense because the answers could very well not be knowable; that does not however, prevent us from coming up with perfectly sound logical explanations for any answers we want for these questions though. I will point out that INTPs are notorious for being one of the most anti-religious people out there, and hopefully it makes sense why: we're good at logically explaining away most of the things religion offers anyway... we're good at coercing non-truth value questions into valid truth value situations, whether that means arguing for biology/cosmology, or philosophically tearing apart the notion that it's even useful to waste energy on intrinsically unknowable questions in the first place. We might be fascinated with ideas, but our view is still pretty practical at the end of the day.

Which brings us to the 2nd dimension, which is the: *should* we be evaluating truth statements in instances where it makes sense and we can reasonably reach an answer?

Instead of answering that head-on right away, take a moment to think about what answering ""No"" to that question would imply, because we all know everybody here would be leaning towards the ""yes"" answer anyway.

Ok, so what does that answer entail? If we answer ""no"", then we are no longer *guaranteed* answers that make sense *anywhere*, because by definition, very important foundational questions could now be answered in illogical ways. The is problematic is because it's really difficult to evaluate which questions need a strong foundation and which don't. Sure, we'll always have a set of unprovable axioms underlying everything, but that's a bit different from having entire elaborate theories being shaky and unsound *in addition to* the already mysterious axioms. You can build a really solid concrete/wooden house on a poor lumpy seaside foundation, but a house of cards is unstable everywhere.  Some other personality types might not mind instability and inconsistencies, but to us they stick out like a really bad sore thumb, so why should we do that do ourselves? It'll surely just produce more confusion and agony...

Again, this is all a bit of a moot point because I don't think it's even something we can turn off and we just do it automatically.

If you're feeling the need to 'abandon' logic, there's probably a logical reason behind that feeling -- so instead of just blindly following it, maybe you'd get more satisfaction out of investigating why you feel that way in the first place? I guarantee it has a logical basis, so you might as well try. It would be more satisfying if you did, because then you'd close all the gaps in your mental model of the world; your internal system would remain consistent *and* complete -- that's what INTPs like.  Whereas if you just did try and follow your ""raw""/""unprocessed"" ideas (somehow)^1, there would still be that gaping hole about *why* you're doing it in the first place, regardless of your motivation to do so.

1. There's always a filter on your ideas whether you like it or not, however you can train yourself to be less *critical* if that's what you want, but that's different than just 'applying logic'. Again, if this sounds foreign, I still highly recommend taking up more creative activities. Just keep trying different ones until you find one where you don't feel yourself using 'true'/'false' logic all the time...","1380586642"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","I'm in a similar situation, I've played acoustics and classical guitar for years but I recently picked up an electric guitar and have to learn picking from scratch.

The fundamentals are do something easy slow, do it medium pace, do it faster, then do something a bit harder slow, medium etc...

Example, pick one note. Alternate pick once per beat. Start at 100bpm.  Once you feel comfortable increase by 10bpm.

Now play an easy riff on one string. ie Blues brothers/wipeout. Start 100bpm. Increase when comfortable.

Repeat with a riff that uses two strings.

Repeat with a riff that uses multiple strings and skips strings. What I've been using is the bass line to hysteria by muse.

Also you can do this just with scales. Scales in one position, extended scales, scales up the whole fretboard, whatever floats your boat. I've just been doing straight C Major/A Minor scales all over the fretboad while also saying the names of the notes to try and memorise them all.

The other thing to work on is arpeggios. The proper term might be arpeggiated chords, I'm not sure. What I mean at least is hold a chord, for example an open G chord and pick all the way up and down. Change chords repeat. Again start slow and build speed. One song I play to practise this is Kryptonite.

After that, and what's really tricking me up at the moment, is playing chords like that but skipping strings. For example hold a chord, pick the root note and then pick the top 3 strings. The song I'm playing to practise this is Always with me by Satriani. I can do it slowly and while looking at my right hand, but of course the goal is to do it fast and with your eyes closed. :)

It's a MUCH bigger deal than most people realize. Not only from a cost point of view also time and user experience point of view.

Right now and for the forseeable future, Sony unfortunately has nothing to even come close to dynamic spooling servers that could be used for this.

"livesound","t5_2remi","Xpost from this subreddit, sorry i dont want to spam :x

Hey guys, i hope this is the right subreddit for my question.

I'm pretty much a noob when it comes to soundsystems and so i'm looking for some advice or tips of what i should buy. For instance if they should be active or passive, i just have no idea.

""So what exactly will you be using your new PA for?""
I mainly will use them for partys (DJing for a small crowd for instance) or to take them with me and my friends on festivals or just play some Drum &amp; Bass for my friends and me at our homes. So they should be quite mobile i guess.

My budget is about 1500€ and i just have no clue what is good for what im looking for.
The ones what i'd say would be good are:

2x http://www.thomann.de/gb/jbl_jrx_125.htm?gclid=CPTrsu-h9LkCFfMdtAod208AYw

http://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_b1500dpro.htm


But they are passive so i'd need an amplifier i guess. But my dad would buy it for me if you can help me find the right one :)

or 2x http://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_b812neo.htm

http://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_b1500dpro.htm


One of my friends also just bought two of these:
http://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_b115mp3.htm
the same sub.

But hes not 100% satisfied so before i might make the same mistake i better thought i ask you guys :b

Maybe you can recommend something better?

Thanks in advance &lt;3

Although it seems like there's usually an opportunity early on for me to make my interest known, I don't take the opportunity and then they go cold.

It could just be that I'm seeing interest where there's none.  I don't consider myself very physically attractive so it's plausible that none of them were interested in me to begin with.

**EDIT:**
I will say, however, that more than once I have been basically ignored after I failed to make a move. Which seems odd to me if it's just about someone wanting to have sex and not getting it.

For example, one woman basically held my hand twice within five minutes and grabbed my arm to get close as we were walking. I hesitated and didn't reciprocate. After that she went from being friendly and engaging to giving me one word answers to my questions and avoiding eye contact whenever we saw each other in passing.

&gt; ...there has been growing evidence about the health risks associated with outdoor
tobacco smoke exposure, particularly in places where non-smokers may be exposed to multiple active smokers, such as on bar and restaurant patios...

and gives three sources to support this:

    3. Klepeis N., Ott W. and Switzer P.(2007). Real-Time measurement of outdoor tobacco smoke particles. J Air Waste Manag Assoc 2007;57:522
    4. J. C. Hall , J. T. Bernert , D. B. Hall , G. St. Helen , L. H. Kudon &amp; L. P. Naeher (2009):Assessment of Exposure to Secondhand Smoke at Outdoor Bars and Family Restaurants in Athens, Georgia, Using Salivary Cotinine, Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, 6:11, 698
    4. Zhang B., Bondy S., &amp; Ferrence R. (2009) Do indoor smoke-free laws provide barworkers with adequate protection from secondhand smoke? Preventive Medicine, 49(2-3: 245-247)

Whether they are of any significance, I do not know. I have not, and don't plan to find them or read them. I am merely relaying information. I agree that it could be total BS, just because it is in APA format or whatever doesn't make it concrete.

If anything, water should be connected to spring if we go by that logic.

Rather, I would say that earth, as the most solid and stubborn element, is about endurance and strength of will. The important thing about spring isn't plants blooming, is that winter ends. If you survive until spring, it means you have endured winter; it means you have the strength to survive.","1380586657"

The majority the Kickstarters I have seen are essentially preorders at the most commonly given amounts. Whether the price is worth it to you is subjective. 

In the case of Mighty No. 9 we have some huge names involved in the creation. Even though it's not complete and 3rd parties haven't reviewed it, you know it'll be of some sort of quality. Portfolios should always be provided.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Im not saying it does but the tax implications of handing off a share in a company is very different than handing over cash. 

Lets say look at the 2 situations. If the father hands over the company and somehow the tax obligation doesn't exist at all then the company stays in the hands of a family that cares about the business and its success. There is a legacy to uphold and more growth that can happen. If the child sells the company they will get hit with taxes. 

Now if taxes do exist(with no loopholes) they will have to sell the company. This means they will get taxed on the sale of the company if handed off before the sale or their parent's estate will have to pay taxes on the sale. They will then have to pay taxes on the inheritance. If the company was successfully enough MEGACORP might scoop up the company's shares and turn it into a pure profit maker or simply close them up. Rather than having a direct competitor in the market place the child has $6m in cash, the government has $4m in cash and MEGACORP has 1 less competitor.

While yes limiting the handing down of assets does help prevent families that own crazy amounts of assets it also removes competition because it forces businesses to go public or close down to cover tax obligations which can lead to less competition in the market place. Also by the very nature of families over time those assets would spread out as grandkids and great-grandkids are born that is unless the kids turn it into something extraordinary themselves. 

My personal view is that if we must have taxes on assets make it so assets in investments or ownership of businesses then we should make a tax deferred option. This actually discourages people from selling their company and encourages them to continue its development and keeping it in competition with other businesses. Even if people did put money into an investment just to give it to their kids after their death it will still be hit with taxes but it wont be inheritance taxes. ","1380586661"

"gradadmissions","t5_2tn62","Be specific, substantive, and professional. Do not talk about your childhood unless it is truly exceptional, and do not say you always wanted to be a scientist. Your SoP should tell the admissions people stuff they would not already know just from reading your CV/transcript/etc. Focus more on your specific academic and professional goals than on your past achievements (since those will be on your CV etc.). In writing about past achievements, try to say something about what you learned or how they prepared you for this program, rather than just listing them.

If you had personal hardships that impacted your academic performance, they should be addressed briefly and ending on a positive, confident note; or, better, they should be addressed instead in your letters of recommendation, if you are willing to discuss such things with your letter-writers.

Usually the application says something about how long it should be, but if it doesn't, you could try contacting current students at the program and asking how long their essays were.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Nearly half of the health care dollars spent in the US are spent by the government

Yes... [educate yourself about why.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSjGouBmo0M) In case you don't have 8 minutes to listen to John talk, I'll summarize for you here.

1. Uninsured people still get treated at, say, emergency (which is fucking expensive, but it's the only fucking option for uninsured people). So, if we had a proper, pay-upfront, capitalistic system for healthcare, we can just let them die, I guess? Congrats, you're callous.

2. Collective negotiations gives a government excellent leverage to find cheaper prices on medical supplies. I mean, theoretically the insurance companies exert some leverage, but a) they are out for profits (not only out for profits, they're actually out to maximize profits) so there will inherently be overhead there and b) more options is actually *bad* in this situation because that means that they have *less* bargaining power. If you're representing ALL Americans, you have a lot more leverage than if you're representing SOME Americans. I hope this is self-evident after being spelled out for you.

3. Inelastic demand. Okay, an economic reason. Demand for healthcare doesn't really change with price; if you're good and truly sick, you need treatment whether that treatment costs $10 or $10,000. And healthcare isn't really something you can put off ― if you put it off long enough, you're dead. So, some form of insurance is necessary to protect against usurious practices. But private insurance aims to maximize profits, so they won't insure someone who is not profitable to insure (elderly, people with recurring medical conditions, high risk individuals, etc), which leads us back to who's going to look after those people? The alternative is to just let them die, are you really cool with that?","1380586665"

The 1866 speed memory is probably overkill for them but it does improve graphical performance of the APU as it also functions as video memory.  Although you usually don't think about graphics in a build like this, it's something to be considered.  Graphics do come into play a little bit for certain online webapps that they may use.

Parental builds seem to run forever though with little changes to the hardware.  For that reason, I suggest a different PSU.  While you probably could've gotten by with using the included PSU, there's a good chance it wouldn't hold up for more than a few years.  Power supplies like that aren't made to last, and they may not die gracefully.

Valencia did fuck up on that Aguero goal but overall his defending and attacking is pretty good and miles ahead of last season.

Everyone on this sub always wants Zaha, Kagawa and Januzaj to start every game because they saw their highlights, but the match is 90 minutes and there are a lot of factors in play, this isn't Fifa where you buy a player and toss him into the team, his rating never changing and only growing.(although I do agree Kagawa needs to get started IN his position)","1380586669"

I felt that emptiness from needing a woman after a break up with my 4-year long girlfriend, but in the months that I've been working on myself I've filled up that void with confidence.

"BipolarReddit","t5_2qzru","This is coming from personal experience, and I'd recommend having a chat with your GP or psych before you start taking anything in conjunction with your medication, but I had similar issues and was prompted by my pysch to try omega-3 and multi-b supplements. 

I've been taking them for a little while now, and myself and others have noticed an increase in my work performance, which I attribute to sharper memory.  Advocates of B vitamins also claim it can help with anxiety and depression, as well as increased energy.  There have also been some studies into the benefits of omega-3 in patients with bipolar, and there is some evidence indicating it can be helpful in the right quantities.   

Definitely look into them, do a bit of research online (omega-3 especially can cause side effects in some people), and have a chat with your doctor and get their opinion on if they think you could see benefits from taking supplements.  

[This is a summary of 16 studies, all looking into the effects of omega-3 in mental health patients.  It's worth a shot.] (http://www.psycheducation.org/depression/meds/Omega-3.htm)  

Good luck friend, understand the frustration you feel is justified - Bipolar is a nightmare, but with the right medication and healthy lifestyle things do get better.  

EDIT: I tried to word this comment carefully, but I think it's best I include this disclaimer as well.  Dietary supplements are not and should not be treated as alternatives to medicine.  Mental illness should be taken as seriously as any other medical condition, and requires treatment by medical professionals.  Please have a discussion with your psychiatrist before making a decision to add any kind of supplements to your treatment regime.","1380586672"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I volunteer for Wolf-PAC and I support Move to Amend fully.  They are essentially having the states all call on Congress to propose an amendment to the Constitution which is what we need to reverse Citizen's United as it completely opened the doors on private, corporate, and union money in our elections.  If you don't see money in elections/politics being the root of most of our woes - well, I don't know what to tell you.
But, Move to Amend is requesting that Congress vote to limit the money they can get while they failed to even pass the DISCLOSE Act.  They are too corrupt for us to count on them policing themselves or solving this problem.  That is why the Wolf-PAC solution can be considered an insurance policy for Move to Amend's efforts and we should support both.  Our resolution will (if passed by 34 state legislatures) will create a state convention with delegates from each state coming together to draft a Constitutional Amendment WITHOUT the help, hindrance, or interference from the D.C. Congress.  After it is drafted and agreed upon by those in the convention it will still have to be ratified by 75% of the states, so it has several built-in safety measures.  The focus of the convention is narrow in scope but broad enough for a healthy debate.  The Article V. Convention is in place for exactly this type of situation - where the federal government is not respecting the will of the people and is running roughshod over the rule of law.  This is the safety valve that would allow the states to correct an out of control federal government, and it's our civic duty to enact it!","1380586672"

I'm not trying to argue fun level, different people find different things more fun. But if you really think LoL is the better designed game you're delusional. It lack the mechanical depth, no denying, top and bottom lane are the same, no jungle stacking/pulling. Items that just give stats and dont have important use effects. Champions are much more boring as well than DotA heros. The thing that made Brood War such a good game is that everything was overpowered, and DotA copies that idea. Yes spells are strong, yes stuns last a long time. They are meant to be, they actually cost mana. You can literally use Sven's level 1 stun once in lane before you are oom. Now compare to LoL where you have champions who dont even use mana. 

Riots design of the game is just very poor, it's a poor man's DotA. They release champions to fit a role and balance as such. DotA releases champions to match a playstyle. Riot makes the meta and pumps out champions around it. Icefrog makes heros and leaves the meta to the community. This allows for all sorts of strategy and in depth drafting. Many heros in DotA can operate in all 3 lanes and all heros can clear jungle (which is treated way differently. It isn't just a 4th lane like in league).

I ate a bowl of cereal and biked close to 30 miles around noon on a Sunday. I planned to eat a good lunch about an hour afterward. When I got home, I had a voice mail from my mom that said she couldn't stop vomiting and needed a ride to the ER. I freaked and drove her to the ER without grabbing anything to eat. 

They couldn't figure out what was wrong with her, so they started running a fuckload of tests, and I stayed with her until the results came in. By that point, I think I had been by her bedside for six or seven hours and too worried to think about the fact that I biked my ass off and hadn't eaten.

Turned out she was going through alcoholic withdrawal because a mild case of food poisoning a day or so before made her too sick to drink.  Awesome. I was in the ER worrying about my alcoholic mother for a good chunk of the day. Her boozing always leads to shit like that, and I always help her anyway. Fuck me. I got pissed and suddenly realized I hadn't eaten but a bowl of cereal all day. I was ready to kill her for a couple saltines.  

She was released and it wasn't fucking over. I had to find a pharmacy that was open at 8:00 on a Sunday to get her some anti-nausea medicine--so she could get drunk and get rid of her withdrawal symptoms. I drove all over, found one, and waited for them to fill the prescription. Of course that is never a quick process. I think we sat for another 15 to 20 minutes with a bunch of other people who I had seen at the hospital earlier that day. 

Finally I got her home and made myself a meal sometime between 8:30 and 9:00 pm. I think I cooked a pizza and nuked burritos to eat while I was waiting.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Gotta admit for that presumably bit; I was reading on a phone and it looked like a comma. However you can't assume anything in these situations. You saying understanding the situation is being on the side of an attempted murderer is completely baseless. This guy was not defenceless, he was in a fucking SUV which is able to do far more damage than a motorcycle and that's a fact.


Is there something more to this situation that applies to America that I'm not understanding here? Were these guys trying to steal the car? Because here people on shitty bikes are a nuisance and not a huge worry. Surely without evidence that these guys were planning more than being a nuisance then they didn't deserve to be run over. In my mind the reaction far outweighs what previously happened (unnecessary braking?). There were also attacks on members of this motorcycle group that were way ahead of the incident who got run down in the fray.


Also, here's another argument that my critical thinking lecturer would hate, but how many nice guy family men own SUVs with blacked out windows and how many are owned by drug dealers, arseholes etc?","1380586679"
"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; I personally don't think that free will is a good defense at all. You must assert that the free will and ability to act because of that free will of a rapist or murder is more important than the free will of her/his victim.

That's not how redemption within the concept of giving an entire species free will works. You give the whole species free will so they don't think anyone has been singled out, which gives bad people the chance for redemption and everyone the capacity to defend themselves.  
That bad things happen doesn't preclude the idea of free will and defense, having yourself fully protected at all times by depriving potential rapists of free will wouldn't be free will.","1380586679"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","As I expressed in my post, we *have* talked about it.  Let me give you some excerpts from an e-mail I sent almost 1 year ago about a similar recital:

&gt; I have been frustrated because I feel like our conversations--and my trips home--are monopolized by doing things for you, whether it is performing, ...  It's not that I don't enjoy helping you, because I do. It's not that you can't ask for these things, because you can.  It's that I fear that our relationship is defined largely on that basis, rather than on the basis of mutual benefit...

&gt; Another thing that has really frustrated me is that I seem to be unable to decline an invitation without the situation somehow escalating.  There have been many times over the past few years that I have attempted to decline something--whether it is a vacation, or the length of time I am visiting, or the number of times I am performing, or whatever the situation...

She replied:

&gt;  I (admittedly wrongly) presumed what I still say is common in most families, that when one comes to another with a real heartfelt need, assuming it doesn't take too much effort to meet that need, the loved one will try to do everything in his/her power to grant it. 

Her response went on to take some of the reasons I expressed that I didn't want to participate and ""fix"" them--e.g., I said I didn't want the pressure of rehearsing, she said it's only a couple of hours and not that much pressure, etc.  I guess she didn't really see my reasons for not participating as legitimate.

Anyway I have said all of that, and we are back here again, so I feel like saying the same thing again will not improve the situation.  Where I guess I am torn is that I feel her line of reasoning has some legitimacy (doing things we'd rather not do for each other is an important part of being a family) but at the same time I feel like she's asking a lot, and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to balance those feelings.","1380586681"

She took her revenge by getting a close friend of mine to tell my girlfriend that I had feelings for her (which was true but she had kept in confidence for a long time).  My girlfriend broke up with me and I am no longer friends with the wife, the husband or the girl I was friends with.","1380586681"

"Filmmakers","t5_2r1ip","External Monitor isn't necessary if you always have the camera on and close to you, but probably necessary if you are mounting it on something and want to be able to see it. A H2N is a cheap but good recorder, but I'm not sure what the ideal mic would be for this.

The 7D can work...but my concern with it would be the data requirements. 12 minute max recording capacity per shot, the cards themselves can't store that much, you'll be spending a lot of time doing data work instead of shooting if it's just you.

Considering what you are shooting it feels like you'd want a camera that can shoot for hours and you'll end up with a lot of footage that isn't useful but the great moments that you want don't happen when you plan on them happening. Although I'm sure some things can be planned. 

What I'm getting at is that if you have to record him for hours on end and within that period there some sort of emotional or beautiful moment happening you'll only catch if the camera is on as much as possible and for as long as possible. 

DSLR's don't seem like the kind of camera I'd want if I'm trying to have the camera on as long as possible so I can catch that one unplanned moment that might mean a lot to my documentary.

I don't know what you want to say with this documentary, what your angle is, what story you want to tell, or do you just want to record this journey and hope you can create something from it after. What you want from the documentary is really the deciding factor if you can do it with a 7D or not.

If it was me, I would take something that doesn't require as much data management work from me, nor as much storage and that can shoot for long periods of time. Even better if it has good audio recording on it already.

I would consider getting the runner to wear a goPro though...that would be an interesting POV visual I think...especially if it's head mounted. Just as a supplementary camera not your main.","1380586684"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","If Brazil was able to basically eliminate their inflation crisis by instituting the Real and just stabilizing it based on a more stable market (the US at the time) why wouldn't that work elsewhere?

From Wikipedia: (although the NPR link I posted in my OP explained it much more thoroughly)
""The stabilization program, called Plano Real had three stages: the introduction of an equilibrium budget mandated by the National Congress a process of general indexation (prices, wages, taxes, contracts, and financial assets); and the introduction of a new currency, the Brazilian real, pegged to the dollar. The legally enforced balanced budget would remove expectations regarding inflationary behavior by the public sector. By allowing a realignment of relative prices, general indexation would pave the way for monetary reform. Once this realignment was achieved, the new currency would be introduced, accompanied by appropriate policies (especially the control of expenditures through high interest rates and the liberalization of trade to increase competition and thus prevent speculative behavior).

By the end of the first quarter of 1994, the second stage of the stabilization plan was being implemented. Economists of different schools of thought considered the plan sound and technically consistent.""

Paparazzo are usually freelancers but part of a larger network. This network includes people you may know, if you live in LA. Notice how they are always in the right spot when a celeb is boarding a plane? Or how there are a handful of restaurants and nightclubs these celebs are spotted at? That's because the staff is on a scaling payroll which can get them fired if they're figured out.

For instance if a hostess at Mr. Chows (famous celeb spot in LA) consistently feeds outlets, specifically TMZ, correct information about celebs who've made reservations at the spot, TMZ or similar publications pay that person some cash. The more correct info they give them, the more they get paid over time. If they give incorrect info consistently or get caught, they are cut off from the system. 

Think of this situation and apply it to just about any scenario. Airline workers, nightclub bouncers, etc.

Some of these people make more money than the Paparazzo. 

This is of course extends to people who work in hospitals (did a celeb just OD?!), shady of fickle ""friends"" of said celebs, people who work in rehab clinics... the list goes on and on. 

This is also why TMZ shouldn't be immediately dismissed as a reputable news source. Because they've been around for some time now they have a very solid network for informants to relay back information (people they trust) and Paparazzi  that know where to be, how to walk the line when it comes to the privacy laws, etc. TMZ, regardless of what you think about it is hardly ever wrong, and they consistently break stories in that world faster and more accurately than the top news organizations because of what I've stated above and the lack of red tape. If they get something wrong, so be it.. they are right 98% of the time.

I know this doesn't directly answer your question OP but since this subject is something I'm familiar with I wanted to give my input. 

**Source:** Close friends that work for TMZ (editing the TV show). If there is interest, I can go deeper. TMZ understands ""new media"" like no other and are hardly rivaled. 

Also keep in mind that the celebs that go to these hot spots are looking for attention. That's why you don't see George Clooney and other high profile but private celebs on the front page of publications like you do with say the Kardashians, who survive because of these gossip entertainment news outlets.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","My point is that, if two people have decided to tell each other their numbers, they should *clarify with each other* whether they mean ""sex"" to be just PIV sex or any sexual activity. It doesn't do much good to tell each other your numbers if you are using different definitions of ""sex"" and don't realize it.

And what I meant about the itemizing thing is that it gets more complicated and blurry after you start counting more than just PIV sex. I mean, something like blowjobs I could probably figure out. But then I suppose we'd have to count handjobs and fingering too. And at that point things get less clear. Like I imagine you wouldn't count everyone you'd kissed, you'd count *sexual* contact, but I'm sure many of us have some blurry incidents where maybe there was touching while making out, but not really a specific sexual act, maybe some drunken fumbling around down there or something. Like how long do I have to touch a guy's penis for him to count as a sexual partner of mine? Somewhere in between grazing it and a completed handjob? How do I decide, and how could it possible be standardized enough across people for their numbers to really mean anything at all? (I'm not asking for actual answers to the these questions, I'm just trying to explain my thinking behind my opinion that just counting PIV sex makes the most sense). I also don't think all sexual acts are equally intimate. There have certainly been occasions where I was ok to fool around with a guy but would not have been comfortable having PIV sex, so there's something to it when we distinguish it from other acts. 

But people can and should use whatever definition they agree with, it just seems prudent to me to clarify what definition you use if you are going to discuss it, since there are many people in both camps. That to me seems more reasonable than assuming that everyone is using the ""all sexual activity"" definition or trying to argue that they should. ","1380586687"

"battlefield_4","t5_2uie9","&gt; stripping core battlefield components

What core components of battlefield are missing? As somebody who has been playing the Battlefield series since the demo of Battlefield 1942, I still see the same core components. 

&gt; ignoring player base

While some requests were ignored, you're also forgetting how many things they fixed. Every battlefield game was ""broken"" when it was first released. They have listened more than you realize. You'll see many more changes in BF4 too. 

&gt; a constantly lying community manager who ended up getting fired because he was so bad

That has nothing to do with the game. That's their staff. Also, you can't judge a game based upon the actions of one employee that was fired. 

&gt; battlelog failure

A new feature that they have continuously fixed and improved

&gt;  no ingame server browser

You must be new to the Battlefield series. EVERY single in-game browser for the past battlefield games have been unbelievably terrible. Everybody I know, including myself, used third party software to find servers with past battlefield games. Battlelog has been a blessing compared to the older battlefield games. 

&gt;they screw you out of $60 to buy the game, but also another $60 to play ""premium""

First of all, you don't have to buy the game. $60 dollars isn't that bad for hundreds of hours of game play. Movies at the store are roughly 20 bucks. How many hours do you get out of that? You watch it maybe a handful of times. $60 dollars for many more maps and features isn't that bad either. The market determines if that is a successful model. It proved to be a very successful one. I'm not going to think twice about purchasing premium. It's been the same way ever since the original Battlefield 1942. When the Battlefield: Road to Rome and Secret Weapons of WWII expansions came out, they were both roughly $30-35 bucks. Battlefield 3 had more expansions for roughly the same cost as two of the BF42 expansions. 




TL/DR- Battlefield 3 was a huge success. Millions of people play it on all platforms. It sold 5 million units in the first week of being released. It has received extremely positive reviews from users and publications everywhere. Just because you don't get everything that you want, it doesn't mean that it's a failure. ","1380586690"

They allege that the pyramids are superhuman achievements and that some murals actually depict extraterrestrials. This is simply insulting to the legacy of the Ancient Egyptians. Whilst the Great Pyramid at Giza is mathematically astounding, its construction was not beyond the ingenious astronomers, scholars and architects of the time. And while the Great Pyramid stood as the tallest structure for almost 4000 years, that does not mean that the Egyptians were friends with aliens; it only means that no culture rivaled the Egyptians at building monuments until the 19th century.

The chart is very broad in scope, I don't think they researched any one part of the chart all that closely though. I'd recommend reading up on the matter yourself, as some of the foods listed are not really all that estrogenic.

The quick &amp; simple way to get food-estrogens? Soy, yams, and Licorice Root (for plant phytoestrogens), and probably milk for man-made additives. I doubt anything ""cooked"" would be of any value.

Really here's the thing though... all these foods have only a tiny fraction of the impact that you could get just from birth control pills... cuz birth control pills contain actual prescription hormones in substantial quantities, enough to fake out the body's ovulation clock. Most birth control pills are progesterone based, which can have an effect on the milk ducts and nipples. But there are some estrogen-based birth control pills as well, which would be more likely to help with overall breast size.

Just tell your doctor you want to use a birth control pill that uses Ethinyl Estradiol instead of one of the progesterone based ones, because you felt you didn't like the side effects of the latter. That will get many fold more estrogen-force into your blood stream than foods can give.

Side note: estrogen (and to a lesser degree progesterone) can only increase the size of a woman's breasts if she is somewhat low in these hormones. In other words, if she makes lots of estrogen naturally, then adding additional estrogen won't do anything for her bust-line. She's already gotten all she can out of her genetics with her natural estrogen. If however, she's a little low in estrogen, then taking supplements can have a really noticeable effect on breast tissue growth.

PS: nobody with a family history of breast cancer should take estrogen supplements (including birth control) past age 45 or so. Estrogen doesn't cause breast cancer, but it does cause any naturally occurring tumors to grow and spread more rapidly, if they do occur. There are health benefits to post-menopausal estrogen supplements, but that should be weighed against each woman's individual genetic likelihood of getting breast cancer.","1380586698"

"OldTimeHockey","t5_2w0zz","Okay, I think things have gotten a little radical at this point:

First of all, everyone has incentive to win within their division, regardless of prospects of promotion/relegation. I'm assuming that's what all of us did before this OTH league. 

Secondly, promotion to D2 isn't something to sneeze at. D2 is  championship quality. As much as you all hate to admit it, one of last years best managers (woppa) is competition in it. There's something special about playing in D2 with promotion to D1 on the line. It's boring to just have jumps and tumbles D1 &lt;--&gt; D3

Thirdly, while I think that having 4 D1 teams that missed the playoffs is a bit much to stay up in that league, there's something to be said for the added difficulty of playing in that league WITH 2 extra teams. A guy who gets knocked out in the first round of the playoffs, or misses the playoffs due to a tiebreaker, probably makes that league more competitive than a guy who finds some success in D3.

In the future if you want to keep up with American politics try reading both [NBC](http://www.nbcnews.com/) (more liberal) and [The Washington Times](http://www.washingtontimes.com/) (more conservative). This will give you a good view from each side of the isle.

To answer you questions, the ACA has already passed and has started taking effect. And yes, the 'markets' are supposed to take effect tomorrow. That may or may not happen on time, depending on whether the software that they operate on is ready or not. As of this past weekend it still had some major bugs when calculating the values that people had to pay and could receive from various plans.

Also, is our federal government ""corrupt, confusing, and petty""? Most certainly. But nobody really seems to agree on where the blame should fall.

The problem today is that our federal spending bill (which determines the budget for all federal programs and state level federal funding) cannot be agreed upon between the House of Representatives and the Senate. It's expected that the spending bill will go back and forth a couple times between the two bodies before a resolution is reached. It allows the two to keep each other in check. But in the past few years the spending bill has become a struggling point as our federal expenses continue to sky rocket.

When the Affordable Health Care Act passed, it was already expected to be expensive. I mean, our economy is almost one-third medical in composition. It's a large chunk! So when the ACA started to take effect it was determined that it would cost over twice as much as originally anticipated. Have said that, Republicans who weren't to happy with it to begin with were now shocked at the sticker price and deemed it a good target for cutting costs in the next fiscal year. Not surprisingly, when the House tried to cut ACA funding out of the spending bill is became a big deal. Yes, there are a lot of people who could and most likely do take it to be the Republicans trying to take a back door means of shooting down the ACA. But it's much more practical than that. Our country doesn't have the money to finance it at this current time. (There are many other issues I have with this bill but I won't bring them up here.)

When this happened the Senate looked it over, removed the section that would defund the ACA and passed it back to the House. The house tried negotiating by delaying funding by a year. Now the Senate is saying it will not negotiate on funding for the ACA. This goes against the long standing principal that the two must negotiate and come to an agreement for this whole system to work. This brings us to tonight. We will most likely go over time (as per the past few years). Eventually one side will give in and the other will have their way.

Hopefully this explains things a tad better.","1380586700"

Instead of telling our friend, she tells me. Seeing as how my friend often has sex with this dude, we figured it would be a good idea for her to know that he'd put himself at risk. Sadly, this would also mean breaking her heart in the process.

Needless to say, it went pretty badly.

1). What you study in graduate school is not important, just having a Masters degree is enough.  There are higher ed grad programs out there and I have known a few who went through those, but they weren't any more knowledgable than the others who went through another program.  In my last job, I worked with 13 other advisors.  Some of the Masters degrees earned:  English, Psychology, Anthropology, Journalism, Communication, Theater, Higher Ed, and my degree of Sports Management!  As you can see, it doesn't necessarily have to be higher ed.  So, pick a school that you can afford and study what you want to study.  What helps me the most in my job from grad school is learning how to work in groups because my program had a lot of group work and you find yourself in a lot of groups and on a lot of committees in advising.  I would try to find a program that helps you get some practical experience with advising.  Experience is more key than your Masters subject.  If you go for a degree that isn't higher ed, contact the director of that university's advising office to see if there is something you can help with so you can get that experience.

(2) They eventually decided that maintaining two separate codebase, and reverted that design decision. The new 64 bit JIT now reuse the 32bit JIT techniques and codebase, and is about twice faster to compile code.

(3) What about the quality of the produced code? I would expect it to produce slower code (if the original plan was to produce faster code, and they reverted that). The blog post doesn't seem to say anything about that.","1380586705"

No tiene nada que ver, en wikipedia te tiran el vuelo de primer prototipo, no del diseño final. Ademas que importa cuando fue el primer vuelo? fijate en que año volaron por primera vez los aviones que usa EEUU.

"leafs","t5_2r8hf","1.  Agree.  Faces will be punched.  Me likey.

2.  Somewhat agree.  While it will be a ""concern"", I don't think it'll ever be any more of an issue than it was when we were trying to sign Kadri and Franson.

3.  YES.  Very yes.  Been calling this all along.  Bernier is better from a technical standpoint, but Reims fights harder on the puck, and thus is better at keeping it out of the net.  His rebound control seems to have improved tremendously based on his preseason play as well.  He deserves the start tomorrow night (fingers crossed).

4.  I'm not so sure.  I expect our refurbished D-core to be a major offensive contributor this year.  That, as well as the added development of our also still-very-young forward group, should mean we won't have problems scoring.  It's possible it won't be at the same rate, but I don't expect a huge dropoff, unless something crazy happens.

5.  Mathematically, this is just factual, but I think saying we're top-4 in the division is a conservative estimate, so I'm not really worried about this.  All comes down to how we play against the teams that are really a threat to us in the standings.","1380586714"

I had a similar thought a while ago. I was talking to a friend in this fashion:

&gt; Imagine a computer. How can you determine if the computer is on? Wiggle the mouse? Wrap on the keyboard? Sure. Now the computer is on. Now the computer says, ""Hello James. Good morning!"" Was the computer wishing you a good morning? Or was it just programmed to display that message? Did it decide to wish you a good morning on it's own? Does it even have a concept of morning? You would be inclined to immediately say no to this. You might say, ""Computer's cannot think. They simply execute lots and lots of simple commands that build up into a higher function; in this case, wishing me a good morning."" That is true. We know how computers work. Humans designed them and we understand every bit of their architecture. But think for a moment about a human brain. The brain is just a mess of neurons all firing signals around in your brain. We have a rudimentary idea of how the brain works, and so far we think it is just a really really complex machine. The interesting thing is that the human brain achieves a level of consciousness. This consciousness cannot be measured accurately by an outsider, but the effects can be felt by the individual (i.e. people know that they are conscious.) Now lets go back to the computer example. How do you know that the computer isn't aware of itself? There is no way to measure this absolutely. (there are turing tests and whatnot, but those aren't really absolute tests). So finally I came to a possible conclusion: What if conscious beings cannot possibly fathom consciousness? Maybe one of the inherent properties of being conscious is that you cannot understand consciousness. Maybe there are other types of awareness that we don't know about and possibly never will because of the nature of our mind and its existence? The thought not being able to comprehend one's self is a rather strange idea indeed... Of course, the other possibility is that consciousness itself doesn't exist. And that we aren't actually conscious. It just feels like we are. This sounds a lot less probable, but I would like to imagine that it could logically work somehow.

well I hope someone makes it through that wall of text.

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","I'm not sure he would *entirely* disagree, but I don't really care. My homage to Nietzsche's not an indication that I hang on his every word (heh, he would despise that), but rather that the core tenets of his philosophy strike me as just - to put it bluntly - right. His focus on being real with yourself and the world around you in life and philosophy, his genealogical method, the will to power, amor fati, etc., these are (sometimes) uncomfortable ideas I can't refute, and so the ideas have sort of swallowed me in my chewing them over. The fact I came to associate with Nietzsche of all people is probably from the vulnerability from an existential crisis I had after becoming an atheist. I discovered existential philosophy, and from there, it gets predictable if it wasn't already. Originally, I saw existentialism and didn't think it's teach me anything my glorious new religion of science couldn't (I was one of those atheists). I guess I just wanted to sound suave for the ladies (Sartre got around yo'), but I was smitten with Sartre, then Camus, then Dostoyevsky, then Nietzsche, and Nietzsche's fire really spoke to me and kept me interested long enough to consider and digest a philosophy that originally made me uncomfortable to the core.

Nietzsche's not my only influence though, as I've just let on. From what I know about Foucault, I have to agree with the theory power defines ""Truth"". And, despite my continental persuasion, A.J. Ayers is one of my favorite philosophers, and I think he gave technical arguments about ethics and religion that fit more or less right in with Nietzsche's artistic polemics (e.g. god refers to nothing, ethics is an expression of approval and disapproval, etc.) Nietzsche was more interested in the cultural effects, Ayers attacked the subject matter head-on (at least with these two issues). 

About Wittgenstein, being notoriously difficult to comprehend, is probably talking about stuff on levels flying over my head right now, but I really don't think that criticism fits Nietzsche well. I seem to be the only person to see him as being a meta-ethical philosopher. He (if my reading skills be worth anything) wanted to go beyond obviously man-made constructs of ""good"" and ""evil"", and try to discover and describe a method for a fulfilling life, and traditional moral codes fundamentally get that wrong, hence trans valuation of all values, and amor fati, along with much more.

My personal ongoing inquisition is the meaning of a ""will to truth"", given truth's constantly shifting definition in Nietzsche's works, and in other peoples. As for some formulaic, systemic ""Truth"", I think a ""will to truth"" is then just a justification for a will to power. An ancap feels empowered by property, and so it becomes his Truth he justifies. Likewise with anti-propertarians turning their persuasion into Truth, to thus protect their interests and empower themselves. And Proudhonian property theory is something as an attempt to get the best of both worlds if I understand it correct.

As for different reasoning in (man-made) teleology, I'm somewhat familiar, and I find it fascinating. I feel I must stick to my instinct here, and say a ""use"" is always a mean to a desired end, to use stale economic terms anyways. I only have so much time and patience in my life though; I can't read philosophy 24/7, and right now I'm taking a break from the heavy stuff to enjoy The Aeneid. That's something I'll definitely have to check more into though, as I love the Greeks and their philosophies and religions. 

The idea of ""truth"" and the nature of the will are currently topics hot in my mind, though, and I'm still turning over various theories dawn to dusk when I'm not busy. Also, ""non-philosophical""? Challenge accepted, haha. ","1380586720"

"Harmontown","t5_2vo38","I thought you made the ""Once you act on an immoral desire, you crossed the line"" point pretty clear in the podcast. I got pretty confused, though, because it sounded like Dan was arguing it but I could not understand the point he was trying to make at all.

Another point you and Dan disagreed with was the walls - I think there are many walls that deter people from committing crimes because the wall is there (like you said) - the cost doesn't outweigh the benefit. Although the wall doesn't stop everyone and people will commit the crime even with the wall there, I think the wall allows us to stop them once they've been caught. Without a law against murder or pedophilia, once we catch the guy committing it, we can't do anything about it because we don't have any laws saying they can't.

Those walls might not stop everyone from committing a crime, but they also serve as a precedent for what we do once we find out someone is doing it.

Also, despite bringing emotions into it, I thought you were the most realistic and level-headed person on the stage.","1380586722"

"write","t5_2qm75","Here's some feedback.  This reads okay as a draft.  But you would want to punch it up significantly before you show it to a professional.  Among other improvements, make sure that what you're saying is accurate, necessary, and original.

For example:

*Jack stared at the eyes masked behind a steel grey beard.*

Eyes can't be masked behind a beard unless it's grown up around them.  They possibly could be masked below bushy eyebrows if the eyebrows have grown down to cover them.  Because that's what masks do: *they cover*.

Steel grey is a cliche.  It doesn't add anything to the image of ""gray"" (or however you choose to spell it) that the word alone doesn't.

*The musty cabin tossed as groans seeped out from under the wooden floorboards.*

A cabin is not musty unless it has not been opened in a long time.  As Jack and Captain Tribble are in it, it seems to belong to one of them, and you don't make a point of the fact that they're the first ones to enter in ages, obviously it's been utilized recently.  

Also, it may be a personal connotation, but 'musty' suggests dry and stale to me.  Even if our connotations differ, you must be aware that anyone evaluating your work may have different connotations than yours.  So you want to make sure that every word matters.  Otherwise you risk breaking the suspension of disbelief.

Wooden floorboards.  What other kind of board could there be?

If you're going to talk about the cabin tossing, you need to link it to the ship immediately.  Because otherwise the cabin isn't tossing; it's going up and down with the ship.  

The whole ""tossing"" thing doesn't work because you're telling, not showing.  If it matters that the ship is being tossed on the waves (which it may not), show items falling around, characters grabbing at them, experiencing difficulty navigating around the ship.  If it's not worth the time to do that--and the most you'd want to use is a few words--the cabin's motion doesn't matter.

Example: Jack grabbed at his mug as the table slid across the floor.  As the table bounced.  As something else happened.  But make the environment a vivid part of the action.

The word ""tribble"" appears to lack etymology.  This suggests that it was invented for Star Trek.  Again, you're breaking your reader's concentration for no reason whatsoever.  You're not being original.

""Seeped out"" is unnecessarily wordy.  

*The shouts of the crew could be heard above as they navigated what was no doubt a ferocious storm.*

Could be heard by whom?  Avoid passive voice.  Always always unless it is absolutely necessary.  ""What was no doubt""--to whom?  Jack and the Captain know it because they're in a cabin that's being tossed.

Write directly.  Example: The crew shouted as they navigated the sails amid the storm.

Notice there are no adjectives or adverbs in that sentence.  Only use them to clarify.

I could go on, but possibly you're getting the gist.

Don't ever fall in love with your writing.  View it as an adversary that wants to drown your potential in vague and wordy bad habits.

Good luck bud.

I love delving into music review sites and sifting through genres that I'm interested in at that moment and finding new bands.

What I normally do is once I settle on a band, I buy their first album and listen to it until I feel like I've really appreciated it, then move on in order from there to their latest stuff.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies and suggestions everybody, for the good amount of people asking, my favorite review site is www.sputnikmusic.com. I rarely go elsewhere unless I am running dry on that site and need to try to find some other ideas.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","It's fine to alternate running and walking - one of the most popular 'learn to run' programs (/r/c25k) does this and has taken many people from barely being able to run for 60 seconds to running a full 5k. Don't get down on yourself - just get out there and try to run a little further and a little longer every day.

If you're stiff at the beginning, start with a brisk walk to warm up - even though my running is pretty good, I'm still really achey unless I walk for a bit before starting. It usually takes me about 5 mins of running before I loosen up and get into the groove of things. You may also be running too fast - you should be able to keep up a conversation (no, really) while you run. The fact that you mentioned getting side stitches makes me think that you're trying to run too quickly.

If it runs on ether, you've got compression and ignition, but a fuel delivery issue.  Usually a clogged carburetor - disassemble and give it a nice carb cleaner bath (replace rubbers if needed).

If it doesn't run on ether, unscrew the spark plug, disconnect the coil's safety ground, plug the spark plug it back into the coil, and ground the spark plug's threads to the engine block while someone else tries to start it.  

If you don't get a spark across the plug, you have an ignition issue.  Usually a bad coil, but first check to make sure the coil is adjusted properly so that you can just barely fit a business card between the coil and the magneto.  [Video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlSvMQFAs8c)

If you see a spark across the plug, you have ignition, but possibly no compression.  Get yourself a compression tester and go to town.  [Video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0DuLtoHbWg)

I am going to say to her (as you said to me) that we should start a friendship without expecting anything from each other. We'll just hang out, and if chemistry grows we can decide whether to act on it, and if not I still have my best friend. 

I think that will put her at ease as it put me at ease, because it takes a lot of the pressure off and takes it back to basics in terms of chemistry between 2 people, and trying to think forwards instead of being sad about what we have lost. 

Yeah, for me this relationship was relatively short, but I think the end of it hit me very hard because she was my first everything.

There are plenty of anti-science secular people, too.  No side is without idiots.  The hatred and conflict of interest that leads to some wars is sometimes justified through religion, but would probably still happen.  Human nature doesn't change; in fact, I'd argue that religion is a vestigial aspect of the human brain's tendency to observe complex patterns and explain them (however incorrectly) by means of simplified meta-causes, like deities or nature spirits.

So kids go to a Gotye show, should they wear their gotye shirt? No way, they wanna seem cool and deep and into music, so they wear something else to seem more cultured. It's this weird ostentatious game of pretension. Reunion tours and the like (i.e. going to a Rush show in 2013), you won't see this problem. Inversely, fans try to show how they are simply the biggest fan rush has ever had. It's a battle of relevance and popularity.

"EnoughLibertarianSpam","t5_2tzlb","&gt;The problem with your simplistic thesis here is a basic misunderstanding re: the nature of society

I think you over complicate society. You try and place your views on those of everybody else in the world. We can't all see the world through your lens, only our own. 

&gt;For example, you have literally no agency about where you are born, and in what condition; 

I agree with your sentiment, it is true that some people are born into much better situations than others. It would be nice of every person was born on a level playing field, but this is and never will be a reality (I seem to remember your comment about a misunderstanding regarding the nature of society...). You also get no agency with regards to your DNA. Lebron James was born with better athletic genes than both of us. Should we punish Lebron for this? Should we hold him back so that you and I have the same opportunity as making it in the NBA as him?

&gt;you have an absolute fuckload of agency when it comes to determining how to invest liquid capital

What's your point? You also have a tremendous amount of agency when it comes to determining how you invest your *human* capital (capital which is far more valuable than cash when it comes to being a productive member of society btw...). But by your logic, the fact than an individual somehow has agency in investing their human capital somehow makes each and everyone one of us oppressive?

&gt;Are you starting to understand why libertarianism is an imposition on the poorest to favor the choices of the rich?

Not even in the slightest.

2 visits in the last 6 months.

1st: I was at home and had a stroke, May 4th. 911 was called. They talked my partner through it, ambulance arrived, carted me off. I was seen immediately, on IV before I got there. Had a CT scan done within twenty minutes, drugs etc. After a couple days I went to the Neuro ward for recovery, I was no longer acute. A few weeks later, I was transferred to an inpatient rehab facility for 2 months. After that, I got 2 months of outpatient rehab. There was an audiology screening, follow ups with a neurologist, three more CT scans and 2 MRI scans in there as well.

I was unaware of the financial side the whole time. Literally. I was told these things were happening, and they happened.

-----

2nd: Last week I hurt my foot pretty bad, and after sleeping on it, the foot was not weight bearing in the morning. So I went off to the ER. This wasn't too hard by myself because I had a scooter to ride (as a result of the above stroke).

I told reception I thought I broke my foot. She took my info and swiped my CareCard (BC health card). I told triage what happened 5 minutes later (rolled ankle, fell upright, torqued foot under body as I fell). Sent to Minor Treatment Unit. X-ray done in half an hour. Doc looked at it half hour later. Said it was inconclusive, sent me back for a CT. (Everything was roughly a half hour wait). Got the CT, doc looked, confirmed Lisfranc injury (wiki that). Waited for him to talk to the orthopedic surgeon. I was then put in an Aircast and sent on my way, told to see the ortho in about a week (which will be Wednesday). I was there about 4 hours total, and it was a fairly busy time (6-10pm)

&gt;
**Simultaneous effects**

&gt;When one or more abilities have the same timing trigger or
can be triggered at the same time, each player chooses the
order his own abilities trigger. A player can trigger an optional
conditional ability before a required conditional ability if they
both have the same trigger condition.
If players ever want to perform simultaneous effects at the same
time, the player whose turn it is resolves all of his effects first.

So I'd say yes, in this set of circumstances, Himitsu-Bako is unfortunately toast. 

Thankfully, by the same token, I wouldn't necessarily be *devastated* if Himitsu-Bako was lost this way, as it's a specific set of circumstances to line up for killing a piece of ICE Corroder breaks for a single credit, and surely there would be better targets on the board (baring, of course, a lack of a Barrier breaker, like in my Program destruction example case initially).

I decided to take the summer off of meds so I could evaluate how I felt off of them and most importantly, make some improvements in my life.  I quit smoking, cut my coffee intake drastically, started exercising and worked very hard at creating ways to recognize and manage my stress.  I also ended my relationship.  So, I am feeling much better but I still struggle each and every moment of the day.  

As far as the rigid and cold feelings.  It happened but I am not so sure that if I was managing my stress and life properly AND my relationship was not struggling in the way it was that it would have been an issue.

It's kind of boring if you try to actually play it like a normal game...

And... HCs are exponential in nature. It takes more and more and more cookies to get more, and you're not getting that much faster every reset in order to keep up the speed you had when you got your first few.

The real ""simple math."" would be to take the time I've played and find out how long it would take me to get 20,000 golden cookie clicks if I continued clicking GCs as much as I have (And I've already slowed down a lot, as I've said.)

I've been playing for roughly a week. So it would take me roughly 20 weeks in order to get 20k golden cookies. So almost 5 months of play time in order to get 20k cookies.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","The way the British system works, UKIP wouldn't get any MPs, but would instead ensure that only Labour MPs got it. 

It's because each constituency hands out MPs by which ever candidate got the most votes. So if 51% of the constituency likes right wing parties and 49% likes left wing *and* there was only one right wing party and one left wing party than obviously the right wing party would win because 51% of the constituency's population voted for them. However, if there are two right wing parties and only one left wing party than the 51% percent of the population who would vote right will split themselves between the different parties meaning you get 25.5% voted for each of the two right wing parties (plural) and 49% voted for the left wing party (singular). This means that the left wing would get to send in an MP despite only gaining 49 percent of the vote and whislt 51% of the population did not want it. This is why small parties do so poorly in the UK. The Liberal Democrats suffer hugely from this because whilst they have huge popularity nation wide (at least prior to 2010) it's not often concentrated enough in each constituency and they only end up with a very small number of MPs compared to the number of votes they get. 

So what would happen if UKIP gained hugely in the polls is that instead of UKIP getting a lot of MPs or the Tories getting half as many MPs, both parties would just disappear and allow Labour the Lib Dems to take over Parliament. ","1380586762"

Some highlights:

""It is important to bury the afterbirth so that Satan does not use it to make a duplicate of the recently-born child.""

""Furthermore, some aborted fetuses survive their abortion to live in the sewers, where they are being gathered and organized to take over the world.""

""The Illuminati have nurtured a child, Satan's son, who was born on 6 June 1966 at the Dakota House on 72nd Street in New York to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis of the Rothschild/Kennedy families. ""

Basically, once you buy the item or items (Say, $100 USD worth), and there is a mail-in-rebate for 20$ USD, you can get $20 back. But, you must first purchase the item for its original price ($100 USD). After you buy it and have proof of purchase, you mail in your receipt of the product (and any other specific instructions the retailer may have) and they mail you back the money on the rebate ($20 USD). 

This is taken from the beginning of the [rebate wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebate_\(marketing\)): ""A rebate is an amount paid by way of reduction, return, or refund on what has already been paid or contributed.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","There have been 70 manned underwater labs in history. None had to withstand any pressure differential. Water doesn't just push on anything you put into it. The inside of that object has to be less dense than sea water. There needs to be a differential in pressure between the inside and the outside. 

Aquarius Reef Base, the underwater counterpart to the ISS, maintains inside air pressure identical to the water pressure outside. This allows the entry/exit to simply be an open pool in the floor they can quickly slip in/out through rather than the long, laborious process of cycling through an airlock.

3) If you're paying cash, some hotel workers might be charging you a higher rate, but inputting a discounted rate, and then pocketing the difference.

"SimCity","t5_2ryr3","here's a heap of relatively popular mods/custom content I've compiled over time.

*edit: as for custom buildings - there are simply too many to compile any real list here. However, on the SC4devotion exchange, using the power search option, check out buildings by Simgoober and mattb325. They both have extensive submissions that are high quality and cover a variety of styles.

**Streets/Roads:**

[SFBT Street Trees Mod](http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1196): roadways and steets become tree-lined

[JRJ Street Side Mod](http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=115): adds street-side parking and trees along roadways and streets

**Rail:** 

[Rivit's Railway Upgrade Mod](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/25809-railway-upgrade-mod/) : variety of features, both cosmetic and functional. NAM compatible and I recommend it to any rail-enthusiasts. 

**Terrain/Tree Controllers:** all HD terrains require SC4 run on hardward render. Also, tree controllers should be installed into the plugins folder prior to starting a region.

Missouri Breaks [terrain mod](http://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1635) and [tree controller](http://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1636)

[Columbus terrain mod](http://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=170)

[Appalachian terrain mod](http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2753)

[Pyrenean terrain Mod](http://www.toutsimcities.com/downloads/view/1641)


**Water:**

[Marsh's Riverside Beach Mod](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26517-riverside-beach-mod/) : makes pretty sandy beaches - HD only (check out this user's other submissions for other beach options)

[Rivit's Coastal Mod](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/22358-coastal-modd/): changes both beach and water appearance by depth. 

[Joerg and Teirusu realistic water mod](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21304-realistic-water-v1-by-joerg-and-teirusu/)

[Various Watermods by Pegasus](http://www.simpeg.com/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=db8528f94a80df138a55b633cfd41a0e&amp;action=downloads;cat=26) : many to choose from, all look great.

**Misc:**

[SC4 Launcher](http://community.simtropolis.com/topic/54082-simcity-4-launcher-updated-140b-r7/) Auto-runs SC4 to user specifications (e.g. resolution, number of cores, autosave, hardware/software render, etc.) Prevents CTDs - enough said. 

[RMIP Modular Airports](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/15604-rmip-2-small-airport-edition-vol-1/) : heaps of packs to create custom airports if that's your jam, check out more from this user or search ""RMIP"" for more packs/sets.

Custom modular seaports: many options, I like the SLST port realism kits [pack 1](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19553-port-realism-pack-i-v2/) and [pack 2](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19554-port-realism-pack-ii-v1/) or the Pegasus [CDK3 SP series](http://www.simpeg.com/forum/index.php?action=downloads;cat=38)

[SPAM](http://www.simpeg.com/forum/index.php?action=downloads;sa=view;down=614) : optimize the simulation for agricultural growth and low density city planning (conflicts with CAM)

"chess","t5_2qhr7","really worth it if you like blitz chess a whole lot or are a very strong player (IM level or so) and have a hard time finding competition elsewhere.

to me the nicest thing about ICC is the random pools (1-minute, 3-minute, 5-minute, there are others but I don't play anything longer than 5 minutes on ICC), you just queue and it randomly picks an opponent near your rating ... kind of like starcraft/league-of-legends pairing system.   this doesn't sound like it's too much better than seek/join but it makes the ratings MUCH more legitimate (your random pool ratings are different than your other ratings), and you don't have to worry about rematch ettiquite or things like that.  It's just one game with a different opponent after the other until you get bored, or die of thirst.

there are instructional videos too, but if you have chess.com platinum, i think the content there is better nowadays.

if you have any vanity about your rating on any other site though, you may get your ego crushed if you start playing on ICC.","1380586775"

As far as the thrift shop stories go, there's deals out there, no doubt. Thrift stores usually sell things like that at bargain prices, it just rarely happens.

For example,....

http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/19036/feds-will-stop-hyping-effectiveness-of-bike-helmets/
""Two federal government agencies will withdraw their longstanding claims that bicycle helmets reduce the risk of a head injury by 85%. ""

Now i personally agree that IF you land on your head, it would be a good thing to have a helmet on.  No argument there.  But i think we really should also consider the odds of the accident happening in the first place and that's something we like to ignore. I mean, life is dangerous and there are many activities where you could fall and hit your head but we don't wear helmets all the time because some things just don't occur enough to warrant wearing a helmet.  Many people would argue that cycling is one of those activities.

Also, if we care about the public good and want everyone to wear helmets during ""dangerous"" activities, maybe we should accept the Australian study that showed wearing helmets while driving a car drastically reduces head injuries. After all, the overwhelming majority of head injuries occur in car collisions. Personally i hope we don't because i don't want to wear a helmet in a car either.  :-)  But i find it hard to accept the argument about wearing a bike helmet while we ignore head injuries in cars which occur way, way more often,..like all the damn time. (and cost society way, way more money)

And i also think we should base public policy on more then personal stories where people say ""it helped me so therefore everyone must do what i do."" Not to discount your story of being saved by your helmet because i'm glad you had it on when you wiped out (&amp; since you landed on your head, it helped you) but that's just not a good way to develop public policy.

That's how we end up with silly things like the ski helmet law. 11 head injuries in 11 years out of millions of skiers and now everyone has to wear one. Sad.","1380586780"

I believe it is far more likely the Seanad would be reformed in comparison to an oversight similar to the Seanad would be created. The question in my mind is, ""Should we remove the Seanad or reform it?"" rather than, ""Should we remove the Seanad and replace it with something else?"". I believe we would be replacing it with nothing.

&gt;Listen the Dáil is chosen by the people. I personally dislike Fine Gael and Labour but they were chosen by the people. Had the Seanad been chosen by the people it too would have a FG-LAB majority so where would the oversight come from? Even had Fianna Fáil won, do you think they would act in the best interests of the country?

That is why reform is needed. I'm not arguing the current features and benefits of the Seanad, rather what it could be.

&gt; A completely irrelevant point. Taoisigh generally do not debate referendums and lets face it, most people have made their mind up. Did the fact Kenny refused a debate during the general election mean people wouldn't vote for Fine Gael? Voting based on personalities is a terrible idea.

I'll admit its a minor issue, but it does not inspire condidence that the Taoiseach will not debate the matter on a national level. In my opinion, they see this as a good opportunity to centralise power further and to remove any possible further over sight in the future. I am not voting based on personalities, as I have mentioned previously the major issues I have in regards to the vote, as this is a minor issue.","1380586789"

We put a lot of pressure to be our partner's sexual everything, don't make too much effort to step out of our comfort zone, and then berate ourselves if/when we don't quite live up to the task. I find that kind of silly.

You will both have to change your mindset, learn to embrace sex as something people can do outside of a romantic context. This is something the two of you can do on your own, and when you feel more mentally prepared then you can try taking on another person.

3. Mixed: Try to add features for both competition and casual play at once.

1. Has the most successes, but partly depends on ""getting lucky"" with a game that reaches critical mass. The nice thing is that even if you fail, you might still have a profitable game, with a franchise that people remember and like the the next time you try.
2. The closest to failing get-rich-quick schemes. Lots of marketing, and then the game has no longevity and fizzles out and people forget about it by the next E3.

"AsianBeauty","t5_2w0u7","yes! you are like me. 

as much as i am obsesed with asian brands..i don't actually bother with most of the skin care! SOOOOO you ar ein luck.

1. EYELINER: etude house LIQUID liners (not a big fan of their pencils) are WONDERFUL! i always get the brown, black, AND a glittery champagne color (wonderful for the undereye/inner corner). i also recommend the CLIO gelpresso! these are found in drugstores like Olive Young/Watsons. Japanese brands are easy to find at the same stores. I really like my dejavu liquid liner. 

2. EYESHADOW: I find eyeshadows to be quite difficult to work with. They are often SUPER glittery and not very pigmented. i'm not sure if you are into that or not. For powder shadows, I like Tony Moly and 3 Concept Eyes. For stick (aka cream) shadows, I like the Innisfree chubby sticks.

3. LIP: OH MY GAWD. As a lip fan addict..I CANNOT GET ENOUGH LIP PRODUCTS! For ease..Etude House has to be it. They have my favorite lip tint (Fresh Cherry!) but their new Rose tints (which feature more deeper reds and pinks) are also awesome. They also have pretty good lipsticks, but I am more fond of Missha lipsticks.  

4. RANDOM EXTRAS: Tony Moly tomato/apple, Laniege water bank moisture cream, Missha time revolution line, and benton/mizon are all things that get a lot of love on this sub. Maybe worth checking out!

EXTRA: I wrote a guide to korean brands which is on the side bar. Take a look! If it were me..I would TOTALLY tell my hubby to check out the duty free shops. They are AMAZING and totally worth it! Every brand (global &amp; korean) will be there and they will have great prices. 

You can PM me for more info. Honestly..i could go on forever! haha.","1380586793"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Reposting this so I don't have to type it all out again.  

Out of all of the talking points on how to reduce costs, this is one the stupidest ones out there...and it doesn't work as shown already. Insurance is a two way street. It's not just you buying insurance. It's insurance contracting with physicians to accept their rates. Costs of services and procedures vary dramatically between regions of the country. There's no way a physician in Florida is going to accept the same rate as a physician in rural Oklahoma. Furthermore, the amount of staffing a physician would need to accommodate more insurance plans and policies would be cost prohibitive. So, you very well may be able to purchase a cheaper policy from a different state. That doesn't mean you'll have any place within your state to actually utilize your insurance as not every physician is required to accept every single insurance policy out there.

So how does this work in the real world? Well, lets look at the real world example: the state of Georgia. In 2011, Georgia passed laws that allowed individuals to purchase out of state insurance. Do you know how many out of state insurers jumped at the opportunity to serve the good free people of Georgia? 5? 10? 50? No. Not a single one. It's too much trouble for an insurer to contract out with new physicians in a different state from the state they already serve. The investment is too great.

If it ever did happen, it would be a race to the bottom where you would end up with natural monopolies. Powerhouse insurers with large risk pools would be able to temporarily undercut other providers with smaller risk pools, taking their customer bases until they went out of business. Eventually, we'd end up with a single payer system and that single payer system would most likely be United Health Group. From there, they'd have carte blanche to raise their rates to however much they'd want to pay. You think some other low cost insurance carrier would come into the market? Not likely. The investment cost is too great to start a new insurance company that would be able to be competitive at the start with a very small risk pool. There's a reason so few new insurance companies come into existence and those that have serve small markets (mainly pinching off privatized Medicaid services). It's too expensive and in the case of insurance is heavily regulated in order to prevent fly-by-night companies as seen in things such as the automotive extended warranty business.

So, yeah. This idea is not only impractical, it's also stupid.","1380586798"

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","As for higher education - in the congregations I've been in Germany, everyone with an Abitur (university-entrance diploma) goes to university and nobody questioned me when I went to university. In fact, young JWs who go to collegue seem to stick to the organization (less money, dependant on parents, late earners), compared to those who get a lower degree and enter a traineeship (already a stable job at 18-19 y, more independence).

Even the COs I've talked to were pro-education. When I suffered from depression and didn't know what to do after school, the CO told me that when I enjoy learing, I should go to university. He said that he has regrets for not going to university when he was younger. The second CO congratulated me for being accepted to university (after he made sure that I'll be living at home). Also, he recommended me to do sports against my depression. As I look rather weekly, I should start lifting weights.

Also, we had a similar encouragement in our congregation that education is important for a stable and better job and nowadays necessary for supporting a family. As example, with some more education, JWs can find a well-paid job that allows them to spend more time for their family/Jehovah. He called going to collegue a matter of conscience. I guess that anti-education messages in the literature aren't as effective over here, as all schools depicted look so damn American and not like a regular German school. Also, my parents always wanted me to go to university.

As for your friend - she wasn't DF'd for various reasons. I guess she confessed every detail, it was a one-time thing, she cried because she sinned against Jehovah, the marriage was already broken (and her husband seems to be the guilty one) and it's her first offense (I guess).","1380586802"

"technology","t5_2qh16","From that very wikipedia article:

&gt; What Sony did not take into account was what the consumers wanted. While Betamax was believed to be the superior format in the minds of the public and press (due to excellent marketing by Sony), consumers really wanted an affordable VCR (a VHS often cost hundreds of dollars less than a Betamax);[5] Sony believed that having better quality recordings was the key to success, and that consumers would be willing to pay a higher retail price for this, whereas it soon became clear that consumer desire was focused more intently on recording time, lower retail price, compatibility with other machines for sharing (as VHS was becoming the format in the majority of homes), brand loyalty to companies who licensed VHS (RCA, Magnavox, Zenith, Quasar, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, even JVC itself, et al.), and compatibility for easy transfer of information.

It sure doesn't look like Betamax was inherently better.

From the other article you supplied:

&gt; The commonly-held belief is that the technically superior Betamax was beaten by VHS through slick marketing. In fact the truth is more complex and there were a number of reasons for the outcome

Are sorry, but that's hilarious. You really need to cherrypick better sources to support your side of the argument.

Also this:

&gt; For consumers, the most immediately obvious difference between the two formats was the recording length. Standard Betamax tapes lasted 60 minutes — not long enough to record a movie. Conversely, the 3-hour VHS tapes were perfect for recording television programmes and movies. Sony did adapt and offer various solutions for longer recording, but it was too late. The issue of recording time is often cited as the most defining factor in the war.

Well, increased expenses means less profit, if taken in isolation, not less income (revenue), but my point was that you can't take anything in isolation.

&gt; Cutting workers is the fastest way to reduce wage costs. Increasing prices, if competition permits, is the easiest way to increase revenues.

Of course, but you can't cut workers if you have more business that needs those workers.  You can't flood the market place with more capital in the hands of those with little without giving SOME push to the consumer marketplace.

I'm not saying that business will improve for everyone by the same amount they have to increase wages.  I'm not even saying the average increase in business per business will match up with the average increase in wages.  But the increase in business can't be ignored, you can't ""take the minimum wage increase in isolation""

Disputing its accuracy and origins is like disputing the accuracy and origins of Tacitus, the dialogues of Plato, the works of Herodotus, etc. whose earliest manuscripts number under 10 and come more than 1,000 years after the originals were written.

The New Testament on the other hand is based on over 5200 manuscripts in the Greek alone, dated to within 60-80 years of the events, BY eyewitnesses.

You can't get over these facts without espousing ridiculous claims such as ""it's been translated therefore there are inaccuracies"".

If I grab Doran's Blade, I don't get enough sustain if my support doesn't have a heal.
If I grab boots&amp;4, I lose in trades, and last-hitting is harder.
If I grab Long Sword&amp;2, I have a weaker laning phase than the opposing ADC that started with a Doran's Blade, and not as much sustain had I started boots&amp;4.

Is there no better options? Or am I just forced to choose between the 3 on a case-by-case basis? Is crystalline flask, cloth armor, or machete viable alternative starting items?","1380586810"

Suffice to say, you are more likely to find a matured and understanding lady there.

I personally got fairly lucky, but I would not really recommend okcupid to anyone unless they're just fishing a bit. Never take that site seriously... Do not tell more about yourself than you have to. That's the one easy thing most people don't grasp about the whole internet thing, you can be the most interesting man in the world with just a few lines. You also do not have to lie or omit very much, you just do not say too much in general. Dating is to learn someone, a profile is just a review of who they are as a person, not their flaws (most people view deafness as a flaw, which is why I'm going to say that here).","1380586810"

Though prison rape is an enormous issue that deserves attention, is it really smart for MRAs to insist the problem of male rape is worse than female rape because there are so many prison rapes?

I think that's missing a ton about why society is horrified by one and sadly jokes about prison rapes.

I think the time and energy would be better spent on

* reducing all rape
* raising awareness and demanding attention that women can rape men
* raising awareness and demanding attention that there are a ton of double standards especially regarding sentencing
* raising awareness and demanding attention and punishment for malicious false accusations
* raising awareness and demanding attention to innocent people in prison
* raising awareness and demanding attention to not keeping alleged rape victims name anonymous
* raising awareness and demanding attention to problems of made up feminist gray rape
* raising awareness and demanding attention to problems of the dear colleague letter at universities and the shift to preponderance of evidence.
* the various inhumanities of prison, prison rape included

But when I see at reddit or elsewhere posts about male rape is the same or worse because of male on male prison rape, I just see 99% of society tuning out and throwing up their hands and rolling their eyes about the idiot MRAs.

There are several other issues where this sort of ""it's even worse for men!"" is counter-productive and thwart what I think is a more winning message.

Between him and MJD, you could start to see an extra 10-20 points per game if either of them start to turn it around.

Also, I think Jaquizz Rodgers really solidified his start and put himself out ahead of Snelling with this week's game.  If Rodgers is still on your waivers, you might switch Snelling out and grab the extra help for next week.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Welcome to nofap! Here's help:

1. Visit here often.
2. Post frequently, even if comments come in slowly.
3. If you need help, title your posts with the word ""Help"" in it
4. Don't leave the forum until you have commented on another person's post. This keeps the river of this community flowing. Even if you are on Day 1, you have something to give someone: it could be one word.
5. Save posts you find particularly inspiring, and come back to them
6. Whenever you want to PMO or fap, come to the forum and post something
7. Read as many posts about people relapsing as you can at first, notice that many people get right back going a day or two after.
8. Go back and read your posts and comments frequently (there are buttons at the top of your personal page for this) You'll see your progress.
9. Talk about your triggers.
10. Ask questions, even if you think they are lame questions.
11 If you feel like you need a buddy, an accountability partner, or someone to correspond with create a post titled ""Need an accountability buddy.""
12. Get proactive. Get a new plan, new habits. Get a new life for yourself.
13. Don't obsess over your counter. This isn't like a pedometer or a high score where you're just trying to get one run with a high number. This is a continuum. A one way road that never ends.
14. Be around people as much as possible. There are no fapping zones in public like there are for smokers.
15. This is like quitting a drug. Literally. Drugs mess around with your neurotransmitters. If you have too much of it it's gonna wreck you. So remember that you're recovering addict and you don't want to end up in a back alley beaten and bruised. Okay so maybe that's not entirely what will happen, but treat it like it is if that helps! Find your motivator.
16. Choose to not be a prisoner any more. Choose freedom.

But she gave him a chance. And a second chance, and a third. She ignored every single red flag, because he was hot. And then when the relationship gets worse and worse, she acts surprised. Um... duh?

I'm not condoning the guy's behavior, but if she knew it wasn't right from the beginning, why did she date him for so long? If you force yourself to stay with someone for a long time, it's only going to get worse, and that's what this woman experienced.","1380586818"

Where was I when Ronnie was in office. Hmmm I could say nunya. I was growing up in a democrat border line socialist household. With the commie Richard Trumka eating dinner at my parents house once a month, usually on a Sunday after the UMWA meeting. You see, my father was the local president for the UMWA. I knew when I was in high school that there was a difference between collective bargaining and individual salvation. My grandfather would pull me to the side and tell me about the socialist in Germany. You see they took things over too. Healthcare, auto industry and so on. (wow kinda like America today) As a young adult I knew everything that the socialist at the dinner table were talking about was wrong. I knew if they bitched about Reagan on any given Sunday, I knew he did something right and I would take the newspapers and read.

A while back she had these two fat friends with shitty relationships, and we (me and the missus) were in a pretty good place. We had our small little issues, arguments about the dumb shit that people that live together like to argue about, nothing unusual. 

Well, she used to go to the two idiots for advice whenever we would argue or whatever, and they would blow the shit way out of proportion. Acting like they feel all *sorry* for her and shit for being in such a horrible relationship, telling her she was completely right and the problem was I was just an *asshole*. When in reality it was their own marriages that were a total sham.

Well, the wife knew I couldn't stand these chicks, and I knew they were throwing salt in our relationship, but she continued to listen to them for whatever (who doesn't like to feel like they can't do any wrong) reason. It eventually ended in a trial seperation for a couple weeks. So we patch things up and move away (Army change of station).

"hardstyle","t5_2rluz","I saw Showtek live this summer. The did not play *one* hardstyle track, despite heavy and loud demand from the audience. I'm honestly sad about what they've become.

At least Wildstylez played an old hardstyle track of theirs at the same festival, but still. I **LOVE** F-Track, Dutchie, The Colour Of The Harder Styles, Shout Out, FTS, Save The Day, Down With This, Born 4 Thiz, Raver... Shit, anything hardstyle they did.

I accepted ""Cannonball"". But it just got worse from there. I listened to the track in the article. There isn't more than a trace left from  what they were, a bit in the lead but no. This is not what I expected four years ago, first hearing FTS.

I know hardstyle is still a pretty immature scene, with the Frontliner-HHZ conflict and bashing of ""everything everywhere"" but when artists leave it _seemingly_ only because another genre gets popular... I don't even know what to write. Headhunterz is heading in the same direction, Noisecontrollers are showing tendencies, and these are two of the most important artists for me, the ones that got me into the whole genre.

And don't tell me some shit like ""if you don't like it, don't listen."" If you don't like what I have to say, feel free to put me on your ignore list. I know I'm not alone thinking this. I expect hardstyle from hardstyle artists, is that a weird thing? Evolving your style is one thing. Changing it is a whole different thing.

It's just fucking sad.","1380586825"

The song is about a man who is in love with a waitress named Felina. He kills a man fighting over her and flees town. He decides he loves her so much he must return to her, even though it leads to his death. 

A quote from the song 

""*Back in El Paso my life would be worthless.
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left.

I feel like I'm making headway, but it's very hard to confront your own patterns, not in a ""I'm such a bad person"" way that lets you escape through guilt, but in a ""the things I did were wrong, and I need to own up to that and be better"" way.

In a strange way, it's almost more heart-wrenching to accept the mistakes rather than anguish over them. But I also feel like I am whole and taking responsibility for my choices for the first time, and it's a really liberating feeling. It's like, all along I could have been doing exactly what I wanted, but instead of doing that, I put other people's feelings in the way and acted like I had to bend myself around them.

I still do that, of course, since the patterns are impossible to break fully. But I'm making headway I hope.

Your body temperature (BT) is determined in (roughly) three different parts of your body. The first is behind the neck, the second is your skin pores (granted that counts for more than one) and the third is your testicles. Your testicles are *very* sensitive to temperature - this is why they shrink when you are cold.

The interesting part of your question is that it assumes to some extent a certain duality between you and your body - however from a scientific standpoint, you **are** your body. So, except for cases of illness, etc..., when your body is cold, you are cold. If you want to trick your body, you must in fact *trick yourself*.

You must trick *your balls*.

Changing a value that is probably defined in a static data file, the database, or a global value is quite different than implementing a new feature.

&gt;""It's hard"" and ""it isn't simple"" are synonymous.

Only if you don't quote me fully:
""It isn't as simple as you believe"" is different than ""It's hard"".  One has a qualifier against a reference point (your lack of knowledge), while the other is a general statement.  If you can't grasp the difference, then you are either willfully being difficult or lack basic reading comprehension.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Reminds me of that joke about women shopping for husbands.

A store has just opened in New York City that offered free husbands. When women go to choose a husband, they have to follow the instructions at the entrance:

“You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are 6 floors to choose from. You may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you CANNOT go back down except to exit the building!

So, a woman goes to the store to find a husband. On the 1st floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs

The 2nd floor sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.

The 3rd floor sign reads: Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids and are extremely Good Looking.

“Wow,” she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the 4th floor and sign reads:
Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.

“Oh, mercy me!” she exclaims. “I can hardly stand it!” Still, she goes to the 5th floor and sign reads:
Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, help with Housework and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the 6th floor and the Sign reads:
Floor 6 - You are visitor 71,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that you are impossible to please.

It was more along the lines of something you'd expect from *Entertainment Tonight*, or *Good Morning America* -- style and entertainment over substance. Which is a fair criticism, but one that applies to pretty much all cable news networks these days.

But an agenda to trivialize or degrade their work? No, I just don't see it. In fact, the one bit of evidence you're relying on -- Shep's interjection of an opinion in response to the engineer's statement -- actually appears to show the exact opposite. The guy said, ""this cost each taxpayer about $7, or the price of a movie"", as a way to show how little the actual cost was to each of us in everyday terms. Shep says, ""If you can find a movie theater for $7 I want to go there"" -- i.e., movies are usually more than $7. Which, if anything, further reinforces the engineer's point -- this cost us *less* than going to a movie!

I understand you don't like Fox News. I don't either. But you don't need to reach and stretch and imply motives where there is no evidence for them just to support your preconceived notions.","1380586837"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As a chick who used to be a huge Japanophile, I can tell you that the worst boner killing scenes are in hentai or Japanese live porn. In their live porn, all their women yowl like mewling kittens the entire time, acting as if the male penis is the worst thing they could ever come across in their lives, as if sexual penetration is the absolute most excruciating thing they could ever experience.

Their hentai, though, plums the depth of sexual depravity. Lots of rape scenarios-- not *sexual fantasy rape*, but rape rape, especially cute, little innocent virgins with big, pixie, Disney eyes being raped by dirty old men. Lots of weird fetishes (like filling the belly with water through the ass until the woman's belly practically explodes).  Lots of ""Lolita"" stuff (middle aged men raping, molesting little girls or women who are technically ""of age"", but definitely are drawn to look like they're 11, 12 y.o.).

It's pretty messed up stuff, yeah, and none of it even remotely arousing. 

Other stuff in porn that are major killers (for women, at least):

1. Cream pies 
2. Open mouth full of man goo 
3. Girl angrily looking up at guy as he screws her
4. Guy grabbing her by the throat
5. Up close and personal shots of genitalia being pounded or pounding in all its overused, wrinkled, prolapsed, saggy glory
6. ""Gaping"" holes
7. Fisting (cya!)","1380586839"

There's no comparison between Thomas Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings and William Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinski.

For starters, Thomas Jefferson wasn't having an *affair*, his wife, Martha Wayles had *died* three years prior to the beginning of his relationship with Sally Hemings (who was Wayles' half-sister). At the same time, however, we have to call Sally Hemings consent into doubt, as Thomas Jefferson *did* own her as a slave. While Ms. Hemings did agree to return to the United States with Jefferson when they were in Paris, she did so only on the promise from Jefferson that he would free their children (as she was pregnant at the time.) which he did on his deathbed some *40 years later*.","1380586839"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","This is almost entirely conjecture. First of all, who's to say that if left to their own devices, the South would not still have won the civil war? Doesn't our own justification of capitalism as inherently superior to communism essentially necessitate a capitalist victory due to long-term economic advancement? 

Most importantly, though, try to consider this from the North's perspective. Just after years of institutionalized rape and murder at the hands of Japanese, their country is even more ravaged by the US and South Korea. Everyone seems against them - and now as one of the last standing communist countries, it's no wonder their *juche* or 'individualism/self-sufficiency' ideology is like the Bible over there. 

I'm inclined to say that if they won the war peacefully and took over then by now the liberalizing influence of the South would eventually lead them somewhere near where China is now. ","1380586839"

[Here](http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab#i=78&amp;l=5c4488a061e71522f9fde5e5cc33a00ed047f78f) is the same build but with a standard engine. It's cheaper, but the loss in speed will hurt you quite a bit.

As for the Raven 4X, it's a pretty terrible mech in general so you're always going to have problems with it. The Raven 3L is the only decent one. [You can make](http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab#i=35&amp;l=97f97c6c2e167e83b447c29efe4614ca63e5d6f7) a kind of poptart poker with the 4X, which emulates a popular 3L build but without ECM it's not as effective.

There's also [an AC20 Raven](http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab#i=35&amp;l=bf4cf6c990bf69159e46e8532700f44c504ad9b4), which is funny but is really not effective at all. It's just kinda fun to play.

It was the first commercially successful video game and it launched the video game industry. But… Twenty years earlier (in 1952), another game was created. It was called OXO and it was a noughts-and-crosses (tic-tac-toe) type game which was played on the EDSAC computer. It was made by Alexander Douglas for his PhD thesis at Cambridge University. It is quite astonishing to think that the very first computer game was created nearly sixty years ago!

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The Wikipedia article on this is actually pretty informative:

http://wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units

There are standard definitions for each unit, and their definitions have changed over time as we've come up with more accurate/elegant descriptions for the natural units of measure.

Edit: I'll add something that's probably more along the lines of what you're looking for. When items like meter sticks are manufactured, they're usually manufactured with a qualified process. A qualified process is one that, when repeated exactly, should produce consistent products. Once qualified, quality control is performed by verifying the execution of the qualified process, as well as spot checking the manufactured items. 

So, when you purchase a meter stick, most likely it's been manufactured through a process that's been qualified to produce meter sticks with some measure of uncertainty in their final dimensions. The lower this uncertainty, the more expensive the product (usually).

What meter stick did they use to qualify the process to manufacture YOUR meter stick? Probably a more expensive, higher-quality meter stick :)

All mathematics are a logic flow from beginning to end. It is a language-free form of communication. Math is what we use instinctively every day!

20oz bottle of bleach=$10.00

30oz bottle of bleach=$20.00
 
50oz bottle of bleach=$35

Hey, I'm going to need a lot of bleach to clean our driveway, there is mildew all over it.  So let's buy like 100oz of this shit. (Just roll with it).  
You buy 2 50oz bottles and you pay $60. Seems like what most people would do. But if you buy 2 30oz for $40 and 2 20oz for $ 20 and it totals the same.  So something is wrong, buying in bulk should be cheaper! 

So let's look at this buy 5 20oz bottles for $50 and you just saved $10.  

Shit like this is how math is useful. 

Let's go buy us a car with all this money we saved from buying bleach and reselling it in bulk packaging! 

We did this like 100 times so we have $1000 to spend on a used car. But SHIT! The one we wanted was $3000. Good thing they do loans! 

You notice in the fine print that a loan for $1000 is 24 months paying $75 a month. Not too bad right? Bullshit! You need $2000 so you are paying $150 a month for 24 months. Simple math shows you end up paying $3600.  That's 1600 more than you needed to buy the car!  You make due with the car you have while putting $50 in the bank and get your car in less than a year.

He wanted $800 so I told him I would pay him 200 in cash and 600 in PayPal for some BS reason I came up with. He really didn't want to do it but when I turned to walk away he changed his mind. I was going to cancel the PayPal immediately after I showed him the confirmation and try to make a profit off the speakers. I did just that but I ended up with a $200 box of scrap wood and metal instead. Worthless. I guess that's what I get for intending to scam a man who I thought at the time was honest.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Yeah, I'm evil, that's it.  The kid was given a free pass to leave.  He kept coming back and antagonizing the police officers, who already ejected him from the casino.  Rather than deal with the paperwork, they let him go and told him to be on his way.  He didn't.  He persisted in yelling at the officers and being a drunken disorderly in public.  After the officers attempted to arrest him, he resisted, resulting in forceful submission.  This too was not enough, as the person continued to fight the officers, and at one time, reached for a firearm.  It then became necessary to command the K-9 unit to assist in subduing the subject.

You have to understand, they were letting the kid go and was just a fucking asshole.  A spoiled, privileged, entitled asshole from a rich neighborhood who thought he could get away with fighting the cops.  The kid was a fucking prick, and deserved to have his ass beaten.  You're not supposed to yell at cops.  It never ends well, and his dad, being a lawyer, should have instilled this in him during his upbringing.  His dad is probably an asshole too.  

I could understand if the cops just picked someone out of the crowd and began to beat on him, but this kid was already drunk and disorderly, and wouldn't let up.  How much is enough?  Should the cops have just let the kid keep making a scene at 3am on a busy street out front of a motel where people are sleeping?

The cops in AC are great guys.  I have seen them let people go for a number of things that would get you arrested in any city in America, and most of the time, they are exceptionally reasonable.  Most of the time they have very violent criminals to deal with in some of our shittier neighborhoods, so the last they need to deal with is a prick like this kid.  I know a number of ACPD officers and they are all good people.  Some of the fairest police officers I have ever encountered.  You just can't go around mouthing off to cops, it's never going to end well.  ","1380586848"

I'm not a BA user, (and decided I never would be after the horrible parked-car-during-hurricane incident) but there's no reason they should define the community at large other than complacency and entrenched stubbornness. 

If your local watering hole or bottle shop uses BA scores or BA cards, take the extra step to tell the managers that BA doesn't work for you any more, and doesn't work for the community. It may take a very long time, but if this message keeps getting out and if alternatives keep emerging, it'll become clear that they don't need BA.

If the protagonist never says anything at all, you are never removed from the feeling that you yourself are the character.

Savagery, Violence, and Callousness can be beneficial but cruelty is a truly superfluous condition.  So I agree wholeheartedly we should be above cruelty.

However, there are much worse ways for animals to die on this planet than a shot to the head to be rendered into food.  Being eaten alive in the wild comes to mind.  So while it may be 'cruel' to grow livestock for food it's certainly nowhere near the limits of horror things endure in the wild.  We are taking on problems that we cannot solve at that point.  Animals don't even have the cognitive capacity for co-existence.  They get hungry, they eat what they eat.  Predator eats prey.  That's life.

And we are NOT evolved to be free of meat.  Vegetarians without some form of heavy supplementation are unhealthy.  Your body NEEDS things meat provides.  Your brain THRIVES on red meat.  To stop eating it would unnecessarily limit us.","1380586855"

"whatisthisthing","t5_2s3kh","That light isn't designed for a diffuser or globe, as it is. You have a few options, some of which are good and some of which will get you evicted.

Best choice but will get you evicted: Remove the entire fixture and replace it with something that was build in your lifetime. Offer to pay for them and have your landlord install them might work and not get you evicted.

Worst choice and will get you evicted: Remove the center stud and replace it with a longer one. Then install a globe or diffuser. It'll get you evicted because when you take out that nut, the fixture will fall into your hands (or on to our head). The wire will catch it, but you'll have to re-assemble the fixture. It's not a problem for me, and I might not even turn the light off, but it's not something for you.

Here's what won't get you evicted, hopefully. Get creative. Those lights are pretty cool. You can touch them and not get burned. They aren't much more than room temperature. The clips on the lights and the lights themselves will hold a little weight but that nut in the middle will hold a decent load, although I won't define ""decent load"". Put a wire around the nut, or a zip tie (wire tie) or something. Then run a string down and suspend something for it. It should be light, artistic and funky. I'd use something like this:

Personally, I think marrying young (before you're out of college) is a mistake. The way I see it, you're not taking the time to meet and date different people and enjoy yourself, by yourself, as a young adult. You're, for lack of a better word, restricting your new, post-parental, freedom by quickly attaching to someone else. High school was about learning to live with other people. College is about learning to live with yourself. If anything, I think we can all learn a lot by taking time to enjoy single life.

The decade after high school is big. You're, sometimes constantly, changing who you are, where you are, what you're doing, and where you're going. You'll have opportunities to date a lot of people, which could change your perception of what you want and what you don't want. Being married by the time you're legally allowed to drink will definitely change all of this. In my personal opinion, I think it would be constricting. It would limit what I'm capable of doing on a professional level. And I'm not sure adding kids to the equation would help.

That's my opinion at any rate. But I'm all for being happy. That's what matters most. And if getting married is what'll make you happiest then you should go for it. All I'll say is make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. ","1380586862"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not very talkative as a rule but today my university society held a welcome talk and I took it upon myself to chat to as many strangers as possible. The icebreaker was easy: did you enjoy the talk? 

This shared experience was complex enough that everyone's responses were different. If I could respond to the answer with more questions, or something of my own then job done: ice broken. If faced with a basic ""yeah, it was good"" then I could ask if they were interested in our next talk. I don't think I've ever had so many successful conversations with strangers in one day. 

So to take away from this: start with shared experience that could go anywhere- if there is apparently nothing shared then there's always the weather and our shared humanity. If the conversation doesn't flow from there have a backup related comment: possibly looking to the future. After this you can excuse yourself from further conversation if necessary without the interaction having been ridiculously short.

""Lovely weather we've been having.""
""Yes, isn't it?""
""Forecast didn't look too good though.""
""Oh?""

Actually I legally get most of my games a day or so early via brick and mortar. No laws are being broken if you find the right shop willing to break street date. That's a contractual risk on their end, not mine, and not on the legal one either. But that's a minor point.

We realized that the day after thanksgiving is the time when people hit the wall of family time, so we go to the farm and shoot guns, then we cookout and drink beer. It's called America day, basically to piss of the Columbus apologists. ","1380586878"

The dude in question was clearly acting as if he was hot shit because he had an SoA cut on, so YMMV. I'm generally of the opinion that if you don't want to get shit for something you should be low key about it.
