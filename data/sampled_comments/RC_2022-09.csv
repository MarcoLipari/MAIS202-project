""His fists encased in baroque guantlets, Zadkiel gripped the edge of the lecturn, and assumed an insistent posture. He wore his full battle armor, a fledging suit of crimson ceramite yet to bare the scars of conflict. Replete with the Horns of Colchis, in honor of the Primarch's homeworld, and a symbol of a proud and distinguished heritage, it represented the new era of which Zadkiel spoke.""",1661990400

 People who never player a classical tournament often fail to realize how exhausting it is to play a whole event on this format. It's understandable, though, as it seems the players don't need to jump, sprint, kick, etc, so it must be easier to not feel tired, but in reality, chess can really exhaust a player (at least, at the high level). For example, Nepo and Carlsen played the longest chess game on the World Championship Match back in 2021, when they faced each other for 7 hours and 45 minutes at their 6th game. All this time thinking, evaluating the position, calculating variants and etc, that's really wild.

The B&amp;M G Foundation had already inlayed the infrastructure to execute the global response in a controllable and profitable manner. The question is, what was the original purpose for setting up everything in such a way as to establish and maintain a narrative, impress upon governments the methods and strategies deployed to respond to a pandemic, have the pharma and medical personnel on board to be in control of developing and distributing ‚Äúemergency use‚Äù (experimental and unproven.. or worse) preventative medicine by injection campaigns pushed by regulations they recommended to governments worldwide (and they listened!)... why would all of that be ready to go, even if the Epstein event triggered it, clearly this was imminent or nearing rollout date regardless. Still, few people involved in pedo island have the room to operate, the resources, the clout, and the desperate need to uphold an image as Mr Gates. Idk anything but to surmise that the Covid scheme was initiated hastily to protect his credibility and shift focus away from the issue has motive if his foundation was so intimately involved with the pandemic response as his discrediting and reputational downfall would be disastrous to the influence and associations he‚Äôd managed to accrue leading up to the Covid rollout. At this point it‚Äôs not that outrageous to assert that Epstein is either dead or in hiding and that the parties responsible are the same as those for the pandemic. I would like to throw out there as well that this coincides with the divorce, this would have logistical implications and would have to be considered a relevant factor though it‚Äôs important to remind anyone reading this, everything is just a theory until there is proof, and some aspects to this comment are provable, but much of it isn‚Äôt nor could be.

"ManyBaggers","t5_hwj28","So, let's start with the obvious. Zuko is a good boy and a brat.

Now, onto the bag. The Chrome mini kadet in duck print is a gorgeous bag in my opinion. I currently rotate:

* Aer City sling 2

* Mantis 2

* Chrome Kadet

* life behind bars eclipse

The Aer city sling 2 is perfect for random every day things, but only a pockets worth. Holding anything more in this bag becomes bulky and tedious. The Mantis 2 works well and is my least favorite looking bag but it probably does it's just better than all the others. It's small, fits a surprising amount, and can extend beyond its means. The LBB Eclipse is comfy with a nice fidlock magnetic buckle and ample room, but as with all slings the more you pack it the worse your shoulder gets. Now onto The Chrome kadet is a wonderful bag that is very big and with a bulky SS buckle, that only makes it worse. But, I have memories attached to it and will never let it go which lead me to the Chrome kadet mini. This bag's size is perfect for what I need plus it allows me to add a bit more which was my main desire. I can comfortably fit:

* Maxpedition pouch containing
Herschel Raven wallet

Keys (and key fob separate)

 Gerber Dime

Fenix E03R 260 Lumen Rechargeable EDC Keychain Flashlight with Auxiliary Red Light 

Fisher space pen

* Fuji x100v

* Gaiter

* Spyderco Matriarch

* Lamy Fountain pen

* Pouch containing odds and ends like tablets, Alka seltzer, Ginger chew, etc.

* Sun screen

* A dog lead (just in case I have to catch a loose dog. Very often in my neighborhood)

* Hand sanitizer

The mini kadet allows me to have room for other things that I tend to put in my bag along the way.

Now the bad. The center of gravity is funky on this bag. It wants to sit too high on the back but also tends to slide down due to any sort of weight within the bag.",1661990400

He was happy to sit in the waiting room even though I gave him the usual schtick of diag time, can't wait, etc.  We thought maybe his bluetooth was turned on, or something, but of course, nothing. An hour after he gets there, and we are still just messing with the car, a woman comes in saying ""Where is my father. Is he here?"". Well, turns out old gramps had dementia, took his car without permission and figured he would bring it to the shop to fix the voices in the radio. She took the old man away, her husband drove his car, and I paid the tech an hour of M-time for his efforts. Just shook our heads.",1661990401

I knew my marriage was over for a long time as well and always knew I would leave, but it was still very different once we pulled the plug, he left, and we filed. It‚Äôs just a completely different vibe, and life than living together, regardless of you knowing it‚Äôs over. 

Even though I was mentally prepared for a while the major emotional aspect of really processing it all started when he left the house. Up until that point I was just in survival mode, being alone gave me the opportunity to deal with it. I‚Äôm taking the time to heal and be alone and work through all of that shit.

I'm definitely intending to try to embody a bit of that hacker/counter-culture/punk aesthetic where I can. Like The Matrix, but make it professional (and maybe a little less latex). 

I also am a sucker for yummy textures, so I'm hoping to get my hands on a few nice knit pieces. I think that having a monochromatic mix of textures can be just as interesting as a mix of colorful patterns. For example, I LOVE [this top](https://www.eileenfisher.com/wide%C2%A0rib%C2%A0stretch%C2%A0square-top/F2TXL-T5685.html?loc=US) at Eileen Fisher and have literally had the tab open on my browser for three days trying to make up my mind on it.",1661990401
"academia","t5_2qwxp","I am at a fairly newly granted R1 that is trying to be more competitive in research (NY state in general trying to up its research investments). My starting base is 75k hard money from the state, but if I get outside grants I can add another 25k from the grant. I feel like this is the lower end of R1s, although its rare to have guaranteed salary at a big R1 too, most people have to start paying from their own grants in later years whereas the state will always pay my base salary. I know humanities here makes significantly less than me starting, while the popular engineering departments are more. I do know the 68k is more than some professor jobs I saw on the market though, even in higher cost of living areas. Can't emphasize how dirt cheap upstate NY is compared to California (where I did my PhD/Postdoc/Startup).",1661990401

&gt; If a character has deduced where the creature is they can attack with disadvantage as long as it‚Äôs the correct location.

They can attack with disadvantage *even if they are wrong*. The PHB indicates the DM should indicate the attack failed, but not necessarily that they were wrong about the location.

&gt; PHB p. 194-195
&gt; 
&gt; When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location ar you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

Invisible is also a *condition*, with *only* the following effects:

* An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. The creature‚Äôs location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
* For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured.
* Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature‚Äôs attack rolls have advantage.

Invisibility doesn't automatically grant advantage on Stealth checks - it *enables* them without hiding behind cover. You cannot Hide at all if you are visible to the person you are hiding from.",1661990402

"buildapcsales","t5_2s3dh","Be mindful of recent listings of in-demand products from suspicious third-party sellers on marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Google, Newegg, and Walmart. These ""deals"" have a high likelihood of not shipping; you should do your due diligence to ensure you do not get scammed. 

* Use common sense - if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* Check seller profiles for signs that the sale may be fraudulent. 
    * The seller is new or has few reviews. 
    * The seller has largely negative reviews (on Amazon, sellers can remove negative reviews from their ratings- viewing seller profiles allows you to see these complaints) 
    * The seller has a recently reactivated account (likely their account was hacked and is now being used fraudulently). 

If you suspect a deal is fraudulent, please report the post. Moderators can take action based on these reports. We encourage leaving a comment to warn others. 

Amazon and eBay generally have good buyer protection. If you choose to purchase from a third-party seller through their platforms and run into issues, it should be easy to get your money back promptly. You may have more difficulties with Newegg or Walmart.

"SoulKnight","t5_3im0d","My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki ""Yagoo"" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",1661990403

My issue is that my blood pressure was recently 150/70 and I upped the cardio game and just took a reading at 135/70, which is an improvement I guess but still high. My face is pretty red some days and the weirdest thing is I have these fucking veins on the side of my head around my temples/brow area that have become really pronounced. I think this is just in my head - pun unintended - but I think I feel some slight pressure around that area too.

"DynastyFF","t5_2umu4","Is this really news? We all know we don‚Äôt really have a true #1. I think we‚Äôve been saying all along this season it‚Äôs going to be more scheme. As opposed to most of Rodgers tenure where he‚Äôs had a clear go to guy who he almost at times forces the ball too - Adams, Nelson, Jennings, Finley. 

Honestly I think it‚Äôll end up being good. There‚Äôs been times in his career where it seems like scheme goes out the window and Rodgers just decides/knows hey I can just toss it up to Adams/Nelson and he‚Äôs going to go get it. Sometimes it works cuz he‚Äôs the best thrower of the ball ever. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt and he misses a guy wide open who had he gone through his regular progression he likely woulda easily seen - ex him missing Lazard on the 3rd down against 49ers in favor of throwing a deep ball to Adams in double coverage. 

The other thing I‚Äôve always felt like Rodgers doesn‚Äôt do enough is take the easy underneath throw. Again I think he‚Äôs so talented that he often times thinks oh I can buy time and I‚Äôll drop it in a window down field. Often times he does - but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work too. The thing that Brady does the best and why his offenses are always so good is because he almost always just takes what the defense gives him. He will throw a dump off to a RB two or three times in a row if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs there. It consistently moves the chains and stretches the defense thin. Then they start peaking underneath and now the down field stuff is all of the sudden there. Rodgers has does this more since LaFleur took over no doubt. But I‚Äôd like to see it even more. Let‚Äôs take advantage of both Jones and Dillion being really good receiving RBs. 

We don‚Äôt need to be prolific on offense. This should be the best defense we‚Äôve had since those mid 90s teams. We just need to consistently move the chains, run some clock, and score an average amount of points.",1661990404

I dont know what your experience level is but this is jist one guy talking to another, if its easier all you need to do for the sono tunes is cut it vertically to fit around anything. I believe it says on the side 9f the tube what the required splicing layouts are. If it doubt ratchet strap it together before you pour.

I recently worked on a job where we had to cut 75 mm holes in sonotubes so we were able to fasten a piece of hardwood to act as a pocket form. The piece we screwed in was only about 300x300. The reason we had to do it that way is because we had to set it between  rebar and weren't able to atrach it within the tube first, before it was dropped over the cage with a tower crane. We're talking a 750 sonotube probably 5 meters tall, and it held up to it.

Then there's stuff like WLW, ORVW 10, Pappy 15 that I'll probably never own a bottle of, but will buy a pour of at restaurants/bars when reasonably priced. 

I did get one of the r/bourbon Old Elk picks, that was a 7yr old wheater and is pretty good, so I would consider that an exception to the age rule. Really looking forward to seeing how older stocks from them turn out in the future if they're not too difficult to find.

I've tried stuff like the 4-5yr Rebel private picks going around (I had one of those from r/bourbon as well), and thought it was pretty meh.

Do keep in mind that it is a good thing as well that we can manually charge the special. That way, we can learn and get a feel of how much we have to ink to get a special. So when in real combat you can go ""The left side of the map has just enough space to ink to get my special, let me leave the right side to my teammates"" or ""if I ink the path to center, I can get my special. So I won't jump to an ally this time"".

"AskRedditAfterDark","t5_2vh2s","Depends on the gender.

But generally:

Physically, I prefer fit or on the slightly chubby end. But those aren't hard limits; I can look past the physical for the emotional, sexual, and mental aspects.

Sexually, a similar libido (on the high end) is preferable. In the past I've sacrificed the sexual side for relationships, and found that it simply doesn't fulfill my needs; sexuality is an important part of me, and is an important consideration for a relationship. Kinky is always a bonus, I'm more of a dominant (with a very limited submissive side) so a submissive-leaning switch is ideal.

Mentally, I prefer someone on a similar wavelength. Let's philosophize and build worlds together! Or pair programming? That's a half-joke, it actually sounds kind of cute. Additionally, some shared hobbies would be nice. Do they game? Do they world-build? Do we have similar taste in movies, television, or books? These are good for judging basic compatibility, but obviously aren't a hard requirement. I guess I generally prefer geeky/nerdy in a similar way to myself.

Emotionally, not too distant. Willing to be open about feelings and communicate as necessary. Beyond that, no preferences. 

I'm bound to be missing something, and again some of the physical preferences change based on gender, but that should be the gist of it.",1661990407

It might also be a good idea to be explicit about the fact that you don't give surfers a key and that the socialisation aspect is very important to you. I have always given my surfers a key.

I haven't been on Couchsurfing since they put the pay wall up, and tourism hasn't begun to ramp up here again yet, so I've yet to meet any of these new people who don't know about the old Couchsurfing ways.

The general perception is that they're nice, helpful people, albeit a little bland. I think most people know they don't drink, and they conjure up images of two guys riding bikes in black pants, tie, and white shirt. Most people do not know any of the theology or that there's even a prophet. Mormons frequently get mixed up with Jehovah's Witnesses because of the door-knocking practice. 

I don't say this to be disrespectful in any way, but people typically forget Mormons exist until they're right in front of them, and when the encounter ends they forget about their existence all over again.

"actual_detrans","t5_2lm45i","&gt; I think transitioning may benefit some people, but realistically it's likely far less than those who are actually transitioning.

This is one of the common beliefs of transmeds.

&gt; And we should probably find alternative methods of treatment and cause for gender dysphoria.

Technical gender dysphoria, the neurological condition, doesn‚Äôt seem to have any other way to address it. However I do agree that what a lot of people are wrongly labeling as dysphoria (generalizing all discomfort with sex characteristics as it) needs other treatments, not transition. That‚Äôs also a common transmed belief.

So out of curiosity, what part of transmedicalism do you not believe?

All in all, speaking with people who transition *was* right for, often times the labeled transsexuals who have been transitioned for multiple decades, should help have a positive impact when dealing with the terf ideology. Just seeing that there are other much more positive experiences, not just the negative detrans experiences. It‚Äôs healthy to be exposed to both imo.",1661990408

New feature development typically targets the current version of the base OS, and there's a small lag while that code reaches the future branch. Because of that, Alpha may get certain new features a build or two before Alpha Skip Ahead. (2/3)

Some features that depend on a new base OS (e.g. Chromium Edge, 4K shell) may show up in Skip Ahead first, possibly months early. When something goes to Alpha first, though, it will almost always be in Skip Ahead in a matter of days. (3/3)

A lot of the data on there Endstep has mentioned is way off, so I wouldn‚Äôt use them as a source of information or let them influence how you play the game unless you are just looking at user‚Äôs builds.  Unfortunately, I think Wildstats has more recently seen a raise in popularity since they started sponsoring Excoundrel, HellsDevil, Darkbreaker, and maybe even iTzSTU4RT and therefore get promoted on their YouTube channels.

The dollar amount of what Heard did or didn't get doesn't actually matter in regards to whether Depp abused her. The only reason Depp's team brought it up is to perpetuate the false narrative that Heard was some sort of diabolical gold digger.

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","People advocating for the legalization of abortion are not advocating for humans to be able to kill one another at any time for any reason; they are advocating for one person to be able to kill another person in the explicit situation where they are using your body without your consent.

I believe that a person is in the right to murder their rapist to stop being raped, even if they are certain that the rapist will not kill them. Their right to put an end to the exploitation of their body supersedes the right to life of the person abusing them. Human bodies are not resources; using someone‚Äôs bodily materials or involuntary functions against their consent is unacceptable, even if those materials and involuntary functions could provide life to someone else.

The legalization of abortion is not the abolishment of one‚Äôs right to life. It is the declaration that your body cannot be used as a resource by anyone, at any time, for any reason, and you have the right to put a stop to such a process‚Äî whether it be sex, organ donation, or pregnancy.",1661990410

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

&gt;Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

&gt;‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

&gt;Ôº∏ What does this mean?

&gt;‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

&gt;Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

&gt;‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

A 10-2 Ohio State is out of the playoffs, no matter who they beat or who they lose to (barring some 2007 craziness). So if they lose to ND, they HAVE to win out.  If they blow out Northwest Alaska A&amp;T this weekend instead, they can take a conference loss. They don't need the juice of a strong OOC win. An 11-1 B1G champ or 11-1 SEC champ is in, period. 10-2 champs are out. 11-1 NON-champs are basically a lock, too (Like UGA last year, and I think OSU is in without losing to Oregon). So why risk a second loss OOC for no benefit?

Now, it could benefit other conferences. An 11-1 Oregon or Baylor team is not a lock for the playoffs, so they may want to be able to point to an ND win to help their case. But B1G and SEC teams are high risk, low reward with good OOC games. And that I think is the best argument for expanded playoffs.",1661990412

* Clockwork Soul, if you pick up Armor of Agathys and spend sorc points on Bastion of law can become this.
* Divine soul with moderately armored, just use a race that starts with light armor to fulfill the requirements for moderately armored can do this starting at level 5 if you grab spirit guardians. But this is just cleric with extra steps and I'm not sure if its in the spirit of your question.
* Granted running off of a similar idea to the above, taking War Wizard with moderately armored can get you a pretty tanky wizard with high AC and Arcane Deflection for saves.
* Another fun one, granted this one doesn't have to be frontline but can frontline is Evoker with a Order cleric dip. Sculpt spells to avoid friendly fire while also triggering Voice of Authority. You get armor proficiencies from a cleric dip so you could frontline if you want.
* Glamour Bard with a 3 level dip in Battlemaster or Rune Knight, Mantle of Inspiration and Mantle of Majesty are perfect abilities for a Warlord style support focused on manipulating the battlefield. Mix in some supportive battlemaster maneuvers or Rune knight runes just gives you some extra things to use to help your allies out.. You can take it either direction by pushing fighter to 5 or 6 for extra attack and a feat, or just push bard up further for better spellcaster.

"infj","t5_2r39a","Say ""I'm flattered, but No"".

Accept the compliments, show that you're grateful. But also be direct and decisive.

Being too sensitive and indirect makes people think that they may have a chance. And codependent people will continue to hold on and ""wait until you come around"". So you'll have clingy, jealous people. Because you gave them no closure.

But also, if you are indirect, because you don't want them to leave, then it's *you* that's being dependent. You like the boost of being chased. But if you're not careful, eventually it will cause tension. Because technically leaving people on the hook is Using them. And there's only so much you can take from people to boost your own ego, or just to try to not hurt someone, that eventually they'll end up hurt anyways.

Rip the bandaid off, or prolong the pain.

If you're worried that rejecting them will cause them to leave, then if they do you know the only reason why they were there to begin with.

Or, if the risk of them leaving is that important, maybe you should say Yes.

Rejection sucks. There's no getting around it. But its always better to just be honest. It shows people that you still respect their feelings. Dangling them along shows that you don't respect them, only your own feelings.",1661990413

See Nobles apparently needed help to bathe, and it was seen as improper for a person  without a garment of some sort to be seen by another person not their mother (and noble mothers had better things to do than wash their kids, or feed them). 

So instead of making future nobles able to bathe themselves the parents of the time decided that the easiest way around this was to wear a set of clothes meant for bathing in. Aka a suit of bathing. Because that‚Äôs easier.

It caught on the way most fashion did, and then was adjusted when people realized that this meant they didn‚Äôt have to go skinny dipping if they wanted to cool of in a river for some reason.",1661990413

"bigseo","t5_2wjav","I've applied to positions ranging from specialist to manager to director. I have seen some companies that have in-house digital marketing teams that ""get it"" but they seem to be few and far between. 

And I do seem to be overqualified for regular strategist positions at agencies, even though they often ask for 5ish years of experience. I would gladly take a director position but I don't think they trust that 80% of my experience is working for myself, and it's a risk to them, both because when they call the number to confirm I worked there, I pick up the phone; and, I have a feeling they think I might be unmanageable after working for myself for so long. 

The truth is I left my own agency because I got tired of babysitting freelancers and wanted a real team around me that is as good at their jobs as I am, i.e. a good PPC strategist, good content marketers, good web devs, etc. Being a one-man shop and outsourcing all non-SEO and sales work gets kind of lonely and I wanted to see what it would be like to be able to put all my efforts into a single company with a real team around me. I hated outsourcing things like PPC and web design to freelancers and white labeling them (as you probably know, clients at an SEO agency often need more than SEO). I found very few freelancers that understood business aspects like SOPs and constantly had to edit or even re-do their work for them. I found one good freelancer in a PPC strategist and hung on to him for dear life.

But, like my post says, because SEO is so subjective (ask 10 SEOs what SEO is and you'll get 20 answers), and there's no real way to grade experience unless you know enough about it to know skill when you see it in an interviewee, I seem to be both underqualified and overqualified. 

I made this post though to gauge others' experiences, not to feel sorry for myself. I know there are a lot of good in-house SEOs here.

EDIT: the bit about freelancers",1661990415

They were a continuation of bands like Fuel, Creed, etc but nobody ever came to take their place on the throne of derivative rock. Popular music moved to rap and Hip hop so Nickleback's legendary loser status was sort of grandfathered in.

"ultimategeneral","t5_2zg5v","Is this vanilla or using the UI mod? Or the J&amp;P mod? The 20+10 units allowed looks like vanilla.

Yes, the Union can win every battle where it is only outnumbered  2:1, including this one. The AI comes in making piecemeal attacks, and the Union can concentrate forces on any AI force and destroy the enemy in detail. The Union also has interior lines, meaning that it is easier for the Union to get units where they are needed faster than the AI can. Another advantage is the excellent defensive terrain. Hold the high ground and catch enemy units crossing water.

The biggest thing about this battle, and most battles in the campaign, is to keep the infantry out of the terrible prepared positions. Most all prepared positions are death traps, and the prepared positions here are about the worst. If the Union army occupies them on BG, expect to lose half of the Union army. Skirmisher units and detached skirmishers do fine in these positions. 

Always use detached skirmishers. These units are OP and using them will cut the army's losses in half. 

I notice that the AI army seems a bit large for BG. I am guessing that this means that the AI manpower pool is growing. If the AI manpower pool was at the minimum, I would expect the AI on BG to only bring about 45k. To keep scaling down, it is a good idea to always push for a full wipe in every battle. The Union can afford the losses.

Here is my version on BG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACiZqkK9v1Q&amp;list=PLt-JAMmvyAGnfo9CsEXfkmF33diBDYPvq&amp;index=12

I highly recommend the UI mod, if you are not using it. The UI mod fixes many of the bugs and broken mechanics in the vanilla game, without changing the game. 

Good luck, and I hope this helps.",1661990415

I‚Äôll still look at every skill and plan my build ahead as soon as I get access to the skill tree. Since there‚Äôs no new game plus why would I want to ruin my experience by having a inferior experience because of bad choices and experience/quests/items I missed out on because I listen to a purist. 

You can make your argument that having knowledge about a game ahead of time can ruin your experience because you won‚Äôt have any surprises or being op early is no fun and ruins the challenge. Well my argument is regardless weather or not I watch a video or look up a guide I‚Äôll still find what I‚Äôm looking for in the end. 
Why‚Äôs that? Because every game I play I farm xp/gold at the beginning to be op, I‚Äôll explore and loot and steal anything I can without getting caught, I‚Äôve done this in every rpg since fable and I‚Äôm certainly not going to listen to a backseat gamer on Reddit telling me how to play to have fun, I know exactly how to have the best experience possible when I play my games, and I certainly didn‚Äôt ask purists to tell me how I should or shouldn‚Äôt play this game, I asked for tips and builds for a tank, and good mods to enhance the game‚Äôs experience with more cool loot. Isn‚Äôt that what I asked for? 

I don‚Äôt look up spoilers because I‚Äôve played games so long (about 60 thousand+ hours) that hardly anything surprises me anymore, the last game that surprised me was elden ring

 If you think I‚Äôll ruin my story experience how can I? What‚Äôs the difference between save scumming because you didn‚Äôt like the out come so you reload your save, and looking up the dialogue choices in the moment? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm looking up the different ending ffs.

Even wasteland 3 had penalties for save scumming because your loot would become crappier and crappier the more save scumming you do but there‚Äôs work arounds and I‚Äôd rather not have to save scum every time I get a dialogue choice it‚Äôs a waste of time",1661990415

"running","t5_2qlit","So I was new to running completely. Had been a couch potato previously. Didn't do sports when I was younger (32 now), and did some weight training in my 20s. My zone 2 to start was around a 3.6 mph walk for an hour. But straight from the start I noticed weekly improvements. I'm 9 months into cardio now, and do a 4.3mph speed walk for an hour at the same heart rate. I wasted about 3 months with the half hour BS, lost 1 month to getting sick and injuries, and lost the first month to not having a clue about zone 2. So I really only have 4 true months of zone 2. So in 4 months I went from 3.6mph to 4.3mph, a difference of 0.7mph. If I continue to improve at this rate, and extrapolate this out over a year, then I expect to gain 2.1mph, which would put me at a 5.7mph jog in a 12 month span of zone 2. So I'm cookin with gas over here. 

This is why I believe I have been successful in zone 2:

* I don't eat within 2-3 hours of running (sometimes longer).
* I run indoors on a treadmill, so weather/temperature is controlled.
* I do however drink a coffee every morning.
* I dialed in my zone 2 heart rate range by going to a triathlon gym and having one of the trainers do a VO2max test on me on a treadmill. I wear a Polar H10 chest strap and use the Polar M430 running watch to keep eyes on my heart rate like a hawk.

The heat will absolutely affect your running speed. If I do zone 2 outside, I have to slow down from 4.3mph to 4mph or less depending on the intensity of the heat. But if you are running in zone 2 for an hour, then I would think your body is still going through the physiological adaptations, such as mitochondrial efficiency. So perhaps when it cools down you'll see a nice boost in your speed.",1661990415

I'm pointing out that ***FAKE TWEETS IN A FAKE STORY*** are nothing to be outraged about.

An author taking inspiration from their lived experience to write a book is absolutely nothing new. Especially aggrandization of events or dramatization of portrayals.

I get it, for many people it's her telling her story so it therefor must be faithful, but she's saying it's not, therefor it isn't her story.

Authors take something called ""artistic liberty/licence"". [This is such an old concept that the Epics of Gilgamesh probably used it. (""Probably"" because we do not know if Gilgamesh, or the person Gilgamesh was taken as inspiration, is real or fictional.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_license)

"sterilization","t5_33k4w","I'm doing a lot better. Most of the anxiety and regret all of a sudden left about 2 days after I made this post. There is still some lingering and I will sometimes have bouts of doubt and regret, but it's not nearly as bad as it was. It feels like I'm going through the whole greiving process as if someone close to me just died. 

I've also have thoughts of ""Why didn't I just get birth control?"" Then the logical part of my brain answers ""I never saw hormonal birth control as an option because of all the possible side effects and invasive methods. I never wanted kids and wanted to make sure it stayed that way."" I will sometimes have bouts of mourning the loss of my womanly function, but that's quickly cured by reading a list of effects pregnancy has on the female body. I'm sure I made the right choice for well-being and sanity, I just need more time to sort through my feelings. 

Not to sound mean, but I'm relieved to know that I'm not the only person that has gone through this. I thought I was going insane. I researched everything I could find on the surgery before I got it, but this wasn't mentioned anywhere. I'm glad to hear yours is wearing off as well and that you're ready to live your best, pregnancy-scare free life! 

Small update: I was able to see my OB/GYN about it and she told me some women grieve after getting the surgery, which was not something she told me in pre-op. Probably not trying to scare me out of doing it, but it would have been nice to know so I would at least know what to expect. I got a psych referral, but the one I was referred to doesn't take my insurance. So I either need to change it to a different version in the same network or look elsewhere. Even though the worst of my feelings are gone, I decided to stick with the psych referral because I have other underlying issues I've been ignoring that need addressing.",1661990418

wikis 
https://iceandfire.fandom.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister

https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister

his time as hand for Aerys  provided the realm with 20 years of peace and prosperity. Tywin did have a reputation as just, harsh but just as the hand of the king. To be fair this is mostly in the view of the maesters and other lords, but I think that many of the small folk also saw him as a efficient ruler‚Ä¶ much better than many in the past. Not many ruler can say that. And he reverted some reforms which were (at least in my opinion) morally good and good for the peasants. But the context is also the fact that Aegon spent most of his reign putting down rebellion from nobles (most likely connected to the reforms which where very unpopular with not only the nobles but the burghers and merchants).  So you can think of his reign as preferring peace and compromise where possible with powerful players, and ruthlessnesses when not possible.

He was also ruthless. There is no going against that what he did to solidify his rule over the Westerlands was brutal, and his war waging in Roberts rebelling and the war of the 5 king as well. 

But to think that he is ‚Äúa westerosi GW Bush‚Äù is incorrect in my opinion. He is much more in line with the likes of Caesar, Gengis, Cesare Borgia ect ‚Ä¶ Machiavellian historical figures and such. And again, you are not supposed to like him as a person, he is one minded, ruthless, uncaring and a bad father. But he was also provided some of the best 20 years the 7 kingdoms had and there is something to respect there.",1661990421

I never use the tapes, however, here a few points.

Wireless headphones uses [Bluetooth tecnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) that operates at **2.4GHz** to work, same frequency used by [microwave oven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven) but with less power. The fact that you can't hear it, it doesn't mean it can't affect you in short or long term.

Since we have a 2.4Ghz frequency operation very close to your ear drums and also taking in consideration the [harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic) in the [audio spectrum](https://www.teachmeaudio.com/mixing/techniques/audio-spectrum), I don't know how the tapes are done or what type of frequencies they are made of, however, wireless headphone might affect the outcome, for better or worse, I would suggest using a regular head phone instead of a wireless one.

About sound canceling.

If you read the original active sound cancelling patent ([US2043416A](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2043416)) basically what it does is invert the phase of the audio 180¬∫ (it captures the external sound, invert the phase before sending the audio to the speakers) creating what science know as [destructive interference](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2816-sound-wave-interference).

Back to Bluetooth...

This technology operates in 2.4GHz, however, it doesn't goes from point A to point B for free, it needs to go through a [CODEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec) to COdify the audio before sending it to be DECoded in your headphone, that mean, the audio need to be processed before it get to your headphones. When this happens there is [quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)) and when quantization happens you have to take [dithering](https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/dont-ignore-dithering-audio-in-2022) in consideration because this is the process that inject noise to fill in the gaps in the whole process. In reality, this is the source of you ""white noise"", your wireless headphone and not the noise canceling process.

If my experience in audio engineering and sound processor development worth anything, I advise **NOT** to use wireless headphones, use the one with regular wires to avoid all that hustle.",1661990421

"MyChemicalRomance","t5_2s0v1","I don't get the ""they haven't aged"" nonsense because they obviously have and it's just kinda weird people want to cling to things like that.

But outside of that, who cares. I'm an older MCR fan too. I was definitely born before the 3 Cheers album, I was old enough to be waiting for the thing to release because I already loved Bullets.

Who cares?

There's a whole load of bands older than me that I love, and there's loads of my age that are just as good.. and younger acts that are just as good.. who cares.

It's all music. People can dig what they want. No need to deactivate your account because.. you were around when the band was.. also around? They're still around, you're still around, whatever.

It's awesome they're getting some more love, it makes me feel vindicated in a sense because I and so many others new MCR was an amazing act but they were a joke, just like the rest of that whole scene, to the majority of the world.

And now, they're beloved. By people that wouldn't have given them a second thought during their active years.

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","1) Blower fans are usually helical (snail shaped) with a gap as wide as the outlet between the blades and housing at the outlet and getting smaller around the circumference (counterclockwise in picture 2) until it gets back toward the other side of the outlet where the gap should be almost zero. This keeps you from just moving air around the inside of the housing and helps direct the air out the outlet.

2) Don't know how big exactly this is but eyeballing the handles it looks like you will get tired before much air comes out the front. You probably want a gear reduction and maybe a flywheel between the hand crank and the fan-blades. These fans rely more on speed than torque so you want to maximize the speed of the blades and the flywheel will help keep the speed steady. I think the flywheel goes on the input side of the gearing in this case. 

2.5) If you don't want a gear the easiest way to adjust this design in that direction would be to shorten the handle arm so that your hand moves less distance to move the blades the same distance.

3) This design seems like it would be awkward to hold. There's a reason most stoking tools are foot powered because the ground does half the work and your body weight does the other half.",1661990423

I was a teenager when Wendal took over and the last chapel before parents showed up was always something designed to make you feel guilty about everyday things that were ""sins"" (watching tv shows that had pg sex scenes, listening to certain bands -  pop bands like the Backstreet Boys were mentioned because the suggestive lyrics, Mambo No. 5, was another one).  A lot of people cried and rededicated their lives to God again in those nights.  I always felt really uncomfortable because I was in the minority of people that weren't crying.

I worked there one summer in the kitchen and as staff we got to take a rickety old school bus into Saskatoon on Canada day to see the fireworks.

But after beginning the test at the second level I felt I couldn't catch my breath anymore for what I felt I needed and that the fabric of the mask kept being sucked into my mouth. (full disclosure, I'm not in good shape and they provided one of those blue surgical masks which I didn't feel was a good fit). And as it got worse I started to have what I would describe as a panic attack and had to stop because I thought I was hyperventilating. I've never had a history of panic attacks, and I was so embarrassed and now I need to go back for a 3-4 hour nuclear test at the hospital. (Wish me luck!

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","From what I have heard from companies that have internal recruiting teams LinkedIn is their preferred method of posting/recruiting.  Be careful of foreign recruiters that have no relationship with the company itself.  A lot of these recruiting companies look for job posts in obscure places, get your resume, figure out the hiring managers email, and submit you on your behalf. Problem is they want a finders fee and most places won‚Äôt pay that, but since they ‚Äúfound you‚Äù it makes it very difficult to hire you direct.  You get blacklisted from companies without even knowing it, even if you found that job yourself and applied before this recruiter submitted you.

Edit:  Forgot to mention, not all recruiters are like this, and in IT you almost always get called by a recruiter, but they usually have some sort of relationship with the company.  It‚Äôs when they ask for your birthday and/or last 4 of your social it‚Äôs an issue.  They are collecting personal information that they could use to legally prove that you are their agent and that the company subverted them and stole their ‚Äúproduct‚Äù.

&gt; Along with its own assessment, the OHCHR published a lengthy rebuttal by China&amp;#039;s UN mission, which rejected all accusations of human rights violations in Xinjiang and said the report was based on &amp;quot;Disinformation and lies fabricated by anti-China forces&amp;quot; which &amp;quot;Undermines the credibility&amp;quot; of the office.

&gt; In concluding its report, Beijing called for a UN investigation into &amp;quot;Human rights disasters caused and numerous crimes committed by the US and some other Western countries both at home and abroad&amp;quot;.

"PanicAttack","t5_2sizq","Hey your question is actually a very good one...

In my experience, my anxiety was deeply (or is) related to energy levels.

In fact, my immediate first symptom is fatigue, and then anxiety.

I learned to be sensitive to this, and not push myself, because that in my case gets translated to debilitation (mentally and physically... and oh boy did this cycle take me years to identify... as one tends to compare to any other).

Which is why, my comment is centered in not doing anything that is pushing yourself. In the case of exercise my vote is we should feel invigorated, and not exhausted .

For some, the only feeling of heart rate rising by sports is enough for a panic attack.. for those, pushing themselves in my book isnt good rather systematically build up to exercise.

Back to me case, my route has been looking for the root cause of the first symptom and treating it, fatigue.

He/She in the post mentioned a very big (\*notice the author said ""ridiculously steep hill""\*).

By no means am I not suggesting to not do exercise, if it makes you feel good (which it should), absolutely...  it will let us bring serotonin, and endorphins up.  ... some of us are tied in a loop that exercise isnt an immediate option just yet.

I so wish I can do sports, go to the gym !!!! and I will get there..",1661990427

I appreciate how tempting it is to assume the masses don't know what's good for them, but I think experts have concluded this applies to candidates also:

""Psychologists David Dunning of Cornell and Justin Kruger of NYU conducted a series of experiments showing that incompetent people vastly overrate their own abilities. ""For people at the bottom who are really doing badly ‚Äî those in the bottom 10th or 15th percentile ‚Äî they think their work falls in the 60th or 55th percentile, so, above average,"" Dunning¬†told¬†the website Life's Little Mysteries.

If they get into the field and it‚Äôs not for them or their mental health negatively affects their work, they will eventually change career paths or get the help they need most likely. Many, many mental health professionals either used to struggle or still struggle with their mental health in some way. For many of them, it makes them a more compassionate, understanding therapist. As long as you have it under control in the therapist space and you can conduct yourself ethically with your clients, having a mental illness should not eliminate you from being a therapist. I understand your concern to a certain degree but there‚Äôs a thin line between being concerned and being ableist.

I need to figure out how to rewire my brain and view these things in a correct way. I truly want to. I don't want to live with continued feelings of insecurity or worthlessness. I don't want to have all this pity for myself because he's had sex in the past. I absolutely do not want resentment in our marriage. I don't want to feel dirty or resentful after we have sex...

"Games","t5_2qhwp","This sounds like ""but it makes money"" in different tones of voice. Except where it flips between 'people don't care about specs' and shitting on the PS3 for trying to be different. My dude. The PS3 was the last *real* console. It had unique hardware with fascinating powers that made one platform's games distinct. And it bombed. It struggled tremendously, until Sony provided SDKs that ignored the unique parts and treated the machine like a PC. Their innovation nearly killed the brand, because Microsoft had figured out that customers want games and developers want to sell games to them. Distinction is an obstacle. 

Making developers jump through platform-specific hoops is what used to be *a part* of the industry, from the beginning, until circa GTA 3, RE 4, Unreal Tournament. That's when developers recognized they could sell any game on every platform, *without* remaking it from scratch. Everything since then has been intentionally generic hardware with blue branding or green branding. Even Nintendo, the toy company, just repackaged an Nvidia gizmo nobody was buying. 

&gt; In order for these companies to compete with each other, we need exclusives

Oh, y'mean there's nothing distinguishing them except the software they can exclude other companies from running? Like how Oblivion had some sweetheart deal with Microsoft, despite being funded almost entirely by Morrowind's success? 

You mean that maintaining this arbitrary rivalry, using software which could easily run on anyone's hardware, makes these companies so filthy rich that they can pull a whole genre-alike out of their ass, in a hurry, by sheer force of money? 

Do you mean to tell me, Sony's buying the studios that did all the actual work, using the money they took from all the games they didn't make - including the games this studio made? 

Funny. It sounds familiar. 

&gt; Video games have always been and will always be a luxury. 

And therefore they should be as expensive and inconvenient as possible, apparently. Like you can't picture a market where the people selling hardware, for games, try to make it work with *everyone's* games, and the people making games try to make it work with everyone's hardware. A market with actual competition between your choice of retailers and products, because multiple vendors accomplish the same task, even if that task is both optional and sooo fauhncy. 

Let me show you what a consumer market looks like. 

Do you know what brand my PC's motherboard is?

To win a championship in the NBA you need a superstar *and* the superstar needs help. It's not one or the other. But the superstar is the foundational piece, you build around him.

If you try to build around prime Russ as the #1 guy, you might be able to reach the second round. And that's being generous because he played with Paul George and still got booted from the first round twice.

"DID","t5_2s73v","""I have a dissociative disorder that stems from repeated childhood trauma."" 

""Why is *MY* life so complicated!?""

Kudos to your patience, I'd have lost it. What a shitty thing to say. For someone to reveal something so personal that affects their daily life and making it all about themselves. You haven't changed. You haven't done anything different.

 It being a trauma response isn't an excuse, lumping everyone together who shares a label is extremely maladaptive and harmful and they need to sort that out with a therapist. Because it 100% leads to prejudice one way or another. Your partner NEEDS to recognize that and apologize. 

I've been traumatized by addicts and a few people with ADHD. It'd be very easy to see where a fear caused by trauma could quickly veer into bigoted territory with addicts--they are already stigmatized, treated badly by society, often have many other marginalizations just by the nature of how addiction itself typically starts as a coping mechanism for trauma---lots of intersections there. 

And I think most people would find it unreasonable if not ridiculous to start crying about how complicated my life is if my partner confessed having ADHD, just because I have previous abusers who used their ADHD as a reason to be awful. 

DID is already stigmatized, acting like it makes *THEIR* life harder for...existing? It's just as bigoted. Trauma or not. 

At some point a conversation needs to be had. Give them space ofc, but be honest about how hurtful that was. That you had felt ready to share other parts of yourself with them because you trusted them. Reiterate that you're *still* the same person (and if other parts have already covertly interacted with them, let them know.) 

Personally I'd also bring up that statistically people with DID are about as common as red heads and are more numerous than the British (new favorite way of phrasing that), so they need to work on their trauma biases because it's harmful not only to themselves and YOU, but potentially anyone they come in contact with.",1661990432

She is annoyed because he says something that is clearly impossible. I mean if you were a political prisoner and some noble walked up to you and said something like ‚Äúyou know you could just say you don‚Äôt feel safe and they have to let you go home.‚Äù Like no fam, it‚Äôs not that simple. That is clearly what annoys her most in that conversation.

Also not wanting to fight Edelgard is not the same as being loyal to her or wanting to fight under her. Dorothea is conflicted about fighting the Kingdom and Alliance as are literally all students conflicted about fighting their classmates. That doesn‚Äôt feel significant or exclusive to Petra. She also says when she switches sides in Hopes that she does so to preserve her life. She really isn‚Äôt a character who has strong loyalty to any of Fodlan‚Äôs nations.",1661990434

"AutismInWomen","t5_3yx96k","If you don‚Äôt know for 100% sure you want kids then *do not* have them. It absolutely does not matter why you don‚Äôt want them. The reasons why you don‚Äôt want them is irrelevant. It‚Äôs the fact you‚Äôre not totally on board. Many parents who aren‚Äôt even on the spectrum can‚Äôt handle parenting. And then there‚Äôs some who are on the spectrum but knew in their heart they wanted them. Then of course there‚Äôs people who didn‚Äôt want them but made do with the fact they were having a baby and things ended up being fine. But to make the distinct choice to have a child, including being careful to not get pregnant if you‚Äôre unsure, is not to be taken lightly. I truly believe if you should have a kid you should want a kid. 

Also let‚Äôs not forget the societal pressure to have children. Although surprisingly these days people are more accepting of those who do not want children. 

I hope this was helpful and not too rambly. I always thought I‚Äôd have kids because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just what you do,‚Äù but once I was in my late 20‚Äôs I realized I didn‚Äôt want them and my mind hasn‚Äôt changed now that I‚Äôm nearing 40. And my reasoning isn‚Äôt even as thoughtful as yours, I just don‚Äôt want them. I haven‚Äôt though much beyond into the specifics.",1661990434

2. In basically every company, a PIP is a punishment. Your boss and coworkers should constantly be giving you performance feedback (good or bad) and highlighting opportunities to improve. The need for an official improvement plan means you're in deep doodoo. A PIP is a first step towards firing you. It is more humane than just firing you, as it gives you the chance to improve and stay, or, more likely, to find another job.

I work for AWS. There's issues, like in most companies, but I love my team and extended team, and it's definitely NOT a toxic place. Other teams may suck :). In my experience, there's more variation within teams in a company than within companies.

How to use it to get a raise? 

1. Compare your current job with the offer. If you prefer your current job, you don't really have much leverage. You can maybe mention the offer to your boss informally, and that you're not taking \*this\* one?
2. If you prefer the Amazon offer, mention it to your boss. Say you're considering it, and see what happens. They \*may\* make a counteroffer.",1661990437

"Bible","t5_2qqbz","&gt; The way German Old Testament Scholar Rudolf Kittle translates YHWH is more accurate than ""Yahweh"",

rudolf kittel, died 1929, the year after ras shamra (ugarit) was discovered? yeah i'm sure he's still real up to date. ugaritic is the closest known language to biblical hebrew (other than modern hebrew). ugaritic, as written with an alphabetic form of cuneiform, has illuminated *a lot* of biblical hebrew linguistics.

&gt; Became YHWH is a 3 syllable word, not a two syllable word like ""Yahweh"" is. 

ya-hu-eh. *three* syllables.

&gt; He explains how he came up with those: ""In ancient times, parents often named their children after their deities. That means that they would have pronounced their children's names the way the deity's name was pronounced. The Tetragrammaton was used in people's names, and they always used the middle vowel.""

in fact, this is exactly wrong.

yud, hay, and waw are all ""im qriah"", mothers of reading. they vary in pronunciation based on their position in a word, relative to other letters, and frequently *act as vowels*. and orthography varies widely in ancient texts, which why we know which letters are vowel-like. for instance, the dead sea scrolls frequently spells ◊ê◊ú◊î◊ô◊ù with an extra waw, as ◊ê◊ú◊ï◊î◊ô◊ù.

we can also see words shift in spelling, from ugaritic êéåêéçêéé (ShLMW) to phoenician ê§îê§ãê§å‚Äé (ShLM) to hebrew ◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù (ShLWM). note the -waw ending; this is a typical ugaritic ending, which gets dropped in hebrew. we see *this same* waw get dropped between, say, ◊ô◊©◊¢◊ô◊î◊ï (yeshayahu) and ◊†◊ó◊û◊ô◊î (nechemiyah) this is a major hint that this is a *oo* sound, like ""shalamu"" in ugaritic, to ""shalam"" in phoenician. this is one major reason scholars think that ""yahu"" us the archaic version of the name.

the other reason is that, well, **the masoretes pointed it that way**. ◊ô÷∞◊©◊Å÷∑◊¢÷∞◊ô÷∏◊î◊ï÷º is pointed as ""yeshayahu"" with an ""oo"" sound on the waw. it's pointed like it's a vowel. so these names that retain the name of god? they're pronounced ""yahu"".",1661990437

Apple and Google could certainly work together to adopt an RCS standard that would work across both platforms and do everything they needed. But Apple has no use for RCS so why would they care if it plays nice. iMessage works great for them, and locks their customers into their ecosystem.

&gt; Apple software chief Craig Federighi said that ‚ÄúiMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.‚Äù Adding RCS support would similarly act to erode that obstacle to Android phone adoption in a family of iPhone users.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Don't forget with most weddings there has been already a lot of drama.

It is generally regarded as the brides' day and pretty much every wedding I've been around the stress over making the day 'perfect' has made the dynamics strained. My brother for his wedding was flipping out over minor things - like the card used for the wedding invites being not quite right. (They were fine, just not quite as he had envisioned.) My friends, who I did the wedding photographer thing for them, wanted very specific things to be photographed and put a bunch of pressure on themselves to make that happen.

As others have said, don't take it personally - it is a big day for the couple just for the ceremony let alone the extra stress family gatherings cause.

In general I'd suggest the usual skills you need for portraiture. Men frequently are not comfortable in front of the camera as normally we tend to be ignored for our looks and dress sense. So you need to be technically comfortable and quick - have the camera prepared for the kind of shot you want so you can move quickly. Try not to have the camera staring at them too much, expecially if shooting handheld. Men react better to specific directions rather than more emotive 'feel this way' prompting. Best yet is if you can tap into what they are passionate about and get them talking about it. Does the father and son share a passion for flying? Sport? Cars? Lego? Get them both chatting about it - especially if you can get them talking to each other about it.

Basically for men be more direct about what you are doing and why. if they ask questions about the hows and whys that often gets them thinking about other things and you can get those more candid shots you want.",1661990438

&gt; The outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, has said that China had committed &amp;quot;Serious human rights violations&amp;quot; against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province which may amount to crimes against humanity.

&gt; The 45-page report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded: &amp;quot;The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.""

&gt; China director at Human Rights Watch, said: &amp;quot;The United Nations Human Rights Council should use the report to initiate a comprehensive investigation into the Chinese government&amp;#039;s crimes against humanity targeting the Uyghurs and others - and hold those responsible to account.""

These files can be edited to whatever file name you wish to use for that ROM, although is tedious if you have an extensive collection.

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","I'm not going to be able to help you much here, but I can tell you a little bit. Full disclosure, I'm not a mechanic, just a home repair enthusiast.

First, for anyone else reading this (OP already knows), don't do this with an overheating engine. The cost of a tow is easy insurance against overheating damage.

Next, it's tough to tell how much damage was done. I would guess it's somewhere between none and a moderate amount.

Finally, my recommendation on what to do. Ask your mechanic to get his opinion. I would suggest fixing the radiator and hoses. The car market is crazy now, and if you can get yours to limp along for another year or two, the market might calm down enough that purchasing a different car isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg.

In the future keep an eye out for the telltale signs of a head gasket failure: white smoke from tailpipe, oil in coolant, coolant in oil, exhaust gases in coolant. Also watch out for any metal shavings in your oil as you perform oil changes.",1661990441

"cataclysmdda","t5_2wktw","Hello, it's me again. I've made very simple vehicle with 500kg mass including driver, and then loaded it up to 1000kg. [actually, loaded some cargo to get to 500kg, total mass with driver was 424kg]
I've tried different speeds [6,12,18,25,45mph] with 500kg, 1000kg, and checked offroad  - it indeed just uses proportionally more power, e.g. with 50% offroad you use double energy with same speed and range. [and max speed is too reduced]. Air drag was 0.61, rolling drag 1.84, vehicle was 1x3 tiles [like smaller motorcycle with 2 cargo spaces in front and back, and other stuff including electric motor, minireactor and seat on center tile]

Test was done on 220 tile straight road, with no maneuvering or obstacles, just to find range and mileage in optimal conditions. All values are bit rounded, due to game not showing me fractions of power used, e.g. 12.0 and 12.4 would show exactly same battery state [2900 before, 2888 after]. Values can be higher/lower up to 5%. Also, you need to maneuver without loss of speed. Results:

* 500kg: at 12-18kmph [optimal] speed 17 tiles/ 1 power, at 45kmph 5.8 tile/ 1 power. 280k+ tiles on one plutonium cell with good speed, in straight line - maneuvering, offroad, accelerating after maneuvers will reduce this but, still, thats massive range.

* 1000kg: at 12-18kmph [optimal] speed 9.6 tiles/ 1 power, at 45kmph 3.3 tile/ 1 power. Power consumption was less than 2x, so rolling and air drag matter a bit. In case of heavier, denser vehicles power consumtion would be more proportional. Anyway, you can easily load 600 kg of loot and got good mileage.

* Now, solar panels. ""1 power"" is 1kW per second. Advanced solar with good weather produces 100W == 0.1kW, so in theory, you should be able to fuel lighter version with one, in perfect conditions. As a bonus test: ~450kg vehicle with +93W [==0.093kW] from two damaged panels, clear weather, Summer, was driving at 12kmph with more or less no battery loss or gain. I've lost charge level on maneuvers, and very slightly gained it on long straight parts on road.

Edit: as a bonus, 2021 Tesla Model 3 Performance AWD is supposed to use 30kWh/100miles so about 108k ""power"" from CDDA. You go 3tiles/sec at 18kmph in game, so one tile is 1.67m??? So, in 1000kg test vehicle you can do about 600km, Tesla with driver has ~2000kg, so ""car"" made from junk/scrap/other 4 cars crashed into one incomprehesible mess has a bit... ~186miles to Tesla's 100miles, seems like technology advanced a little [and that's mostly a joke - all these calculations are rough, this is a game, not real world simulator, and mileage in case of cars vary wildly with driving conditions].",1661990442

I've never understood this criticism of TLJ. I get the complaint that the Canto Bight storyline is boring, or a bit *cringe* with the funny rich aliens and shit, but it inarguably exists. A considerable chunk of the movie's runtime, numerous entire major scenes, are dedicated to a plotline where Finn is the exclusive main character. He even gets his own boss fight!

He spends most of TFA sharing the focus with Rey and Han besides a few scenes at the start and his memorable scene vs. TRAITOR. That movie even uses him as a fakeout joke vs. Kylo just to set up the moment where Rey grabs the saber. In pretty much the entire of TROS he's given little more to do than be a sidekick for Rey, besides one scene with Jannah, and the Star Destroyer surface portion of the Battle of Exegol (which is given the least focus compared to Rey in the citadel and Poe in the space battle).",1661990442

 It took a little while to accept that I didn't need to be productive all the time and that it's perfectly acceptable to just lounge around and relax. I had time to let my mind wander and follow whatever internet rabbit trails I was curious about.

&gt; The outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, has said that China had committed &amp;quot;Serious human rights violations&amp;quot; against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province which may amount to crimes against humanity.

&gt; The 45-page report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded: &amp;quot;The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.""

&gt; China director at Human Rights Watch, said: &amp;quot;The United Nations Human Rights Council should use the report to initiate a comprehensive investigation into the Chinese government&amp;#039;s crimes against humanity targeting the Uyghurs and others - and hold those responsible to account.""

The commercial real estate broker that facilitated the sale of the building really helped us out of a tight spot, moving us into a flex space that fit our needs as a company just in time.   


We didn't pay her anything, she just did us a good turn and I would think made a small percentage of our yearly rent taken from the owner of the building, who she represented.

&gt;A big question that every cultural anthropologist has to think about is this: What do you do if intervention could change the culture? Is that our role as researchers? Most anthropologists would say that it isn‚Äôt our job to change things; however that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt give people information that they can use as they will.

Prime Directive.   Its cool you got the Star Trek reference but it's not exactly a Star Trek original idea.

Also, about anyone from 1913 giving two shits about human rights:

&gt;[The concept of human rights existed in the Ancient and pre-modern eras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights), although Ancient peoples did not think of universal human rights in the same way humans do today.[12] The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century.[13]

&gt;Magna Carta is an English charter originally issued in 1215 which influenced the development of the common law and many later constitutional documents related to human rights, such as the 1689 English Bill of Rights, the 1789 United States Constitution, and the 1791 United States Bill of Rights.[14]

&gt;17th-century English philosopher John Locke discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being ""life, liberty, and estate (property)"", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract. In Britain in 1689, the English Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Right each made a range of oppressive governmental actions, illegal.[15] Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms.

It's funny.  A lot of reading and learning for us today has come from a single picture taken by a person who might have only survived to share it because they didn't intervene.

""Stealing bread"" is a big assumption as much as the writers claiming ""adultery"", however, if we are going to assume crimes we could also assume the most heinous of crimes.    Your assumption that anyone from 1913 doesn't give two shits about human rights means that the person inside the box does not and it could be a leopards ate my face moment if opening what could be a Pandora's box.",1661990445

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, photorealism, particle effects, astronomical poly counts, and hyper HD Textures are going to get marginally better on a diminishing returns curve as hardware improves. We all know that. Also, story telling is story telling. Humanity mastered that a several millennia ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, it going to be gameplay. As in, the actual process of playing the game. The physical, mechanical, and mental aspects of playing these things. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, let's look at two specific games in the same genre. James Bond: Goldeneye and Halo: Combat Evolved. Both considered to be classics of the FPS genre. I've play hundreds of hours in both over the years. Literal months of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to Halo, Goldeneye has absolute garbage gameplay. The controls are absolute anus. Seriously, go play it after any amount of time playing more modern FPS. It's borderline unplayable. The mechanics and layout of each of the levels is nonsensical. The core gameplay loop is mind numbing and convoluted.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, replace Goldeneye and Halo in that previous paragraph with MS-DOS DOOM and Goldeneye. Then do it with Halo and COD. Or COD and whatever hit new FPS just came out. Or Ultima: Online and Final Fantasy XIV. Or Rogue and Hades. Or whatever, it literally doesn't matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, developers are making the gameplay smoother, more intuitive, more immersive, with new levels of QoL we aren't even considering right now. They are breaking out new mechanical systems that revolutionize or flat out create new genres. That is where the real innovation of gaming is going to be. In the core playing of the game itself.",1661990446

It honestly helped for a short while in my marriage, it lessened some of the burdens we both carried.  But quickly it fed the already substantial resentment. It led to the dissolution of my marriage, which I'll be honest is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me.  I'm so much better off on the aggregate but it's hard not seeing my kids all the time.  It's hard unpacking that massive emotional damage from that awful marriage.  It's hard still having feelings for the other woman, whom I cannot be with.  It's hard having my present and future financial landscapes changed so drastically.

^(By: Jennifer Egan | 274 pages | Published: 2010 | Popular Shelves: fiction, book-club, pulitzer, contemporary, music)

&gt;Jennifer Egan‚Äôs spellbinding interlocking narratives circle the lives of Bennie Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record executive, and Sasha, the passionate, troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other‚Äôs pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Kenya.
&gt;
&gt;We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist‚Äôs couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city‚Äôs demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life‚Äîdivorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house‚Äîand then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco‚Äôs punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang‚Äîwho thrived and who faltered‚Äîand we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie‚Äôs catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou‚Äôs far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall. 
&gt;
&gt;A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both‚Äîand escape the merciless progress of time‚Äîin the transporting realms of art and music. Sly, startling, exhilarating work from one of our boldest writers.

Oh I see. Yeah, that would do it. And I suppose the A1 is still meta given how the skin price is still rising?

&gt;Btw older skins don't usually devalue in csgo, quite the opposite :D they slowly go up as long as the playerbase does.

I thought that was only for skins that can no longer be generated out of lootboxes (or their lootboxes themselves no longer drop) and rank up drops. As I hadn't heard the Golden Coil or its weapon case becoming limited, I didn't understand why the price had jumped so much.

My issue with the definitions you are giving is that it presents socialism as ""any sort of action not run exclusively by what we would deem the private sector."" It creates a weird sort of world where every government order and program, even things such as the military. It creates a scenario where the Egyptian Pyramids were built by socialist action, many centuries before capitalism and socialism as we know them developed.

Let's talk through a few theories you may have seen. One says guys in prison wore their pants low to signal they were sexually available. Does that sound like what people are relating to? Seems unlikely to me.

Another theory says poor black people couldn't afford to get their clothes tailored and often had to wear ill-fitting pants. Plausible? Maybe, but it seems a little esoteric for a bunch of high schoolers.

What about the theory that prisoners were issued pants that were too large, so they were always sagging, and then these prisoners wore their everyday pants that way after they were released?

That sounds plausible to me. It also makes sense that it would be noticed and adopted by hip hop artists and rappers who specifically make music that incorporate themes around doing whatever it takes to make money and survive on the streets, possibly getting arrested in the process.

It also makes sense to me that hip hop and rap fans -- including lots of high school kids -- would then be influenced by the artists they're into.

And since the prison issue hasn't gone away, and the struggle of black America that rappers rap about hasn't gone away, then the relevance of the look to hip hop culture hasn't gone away, and the influence on the next wave of kids hasn't gone away. 

Just a theory.

And if it turns out the trend didn't originate with prisoners, but rather on the streets somewhere as an F-U to common (perhaps ""white"") cultural sensibilities, then all of the other links in the chain still hold.",1661990448

I've used AMX controllers in the past with these ZonePros but I don't think it's a good solution here.

It's a weird request, I've already told them that an out-of-the-box solution doesn't exist and that I would need to change their setup.",1661990448

"Reaper","t5_2rm0e","You're not giving enough info to diagnose.

Not hearing one side means you have misconfigured your routing somewhere most likely.

For professional applications (and this is a requirement for any decent ASIO driver) you should only have a single client (software that is outputting audio to the main device). There are lots of technical reasons to enforce this. If you want reasonable latency, it shouldn't be attempted.

Waves plugins are notorious for being bloated, DRM heavy, and causing problems in all Daws. It's more likely the issue is with your Waves plugin configs than Reaper.

"service_dogs","t5_2v0po","If they're covered by the FHA, they are allowed to require documentation specific to your need for a service animal along with the documentation that confirms you're legally disabled. What they're asking for is very standard and within the boundaries of the law. They're allowed to require a doctor's letter that confirms that your service dog is required to mitigate your disability, including information specific to your individual need for the service animal (i.e. what tasks does the dog perform to mitigate the person's disability). Basically, they have the right to be provided formal documentation that proves there's a relationship between your disability and the necessary accommodation (having a service animal on the property). If your VA letter confirms proof of disability but doesn't include the additional information specific to your service dog, you'll need to get in touch with a medical or mental health professional who treats you for/has treated you for your disability to get the additional documentation.

[This](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/PA/documents/HUDAsstAnimalNC1-28-2020.pdf) document from HUD is really helpful for learning about the specifics of what can and cannot be required in terms of documentation for FHA covered housing.

"TheMotte","t5_vkedk","&gt;Have you considered that Banks' version (or even more simply, Star Trek's Federation) is much more popular than anything proposed by any other utilitarian hedonist? There may be a few people who think along the lines you do, but I feel confident in claiming that most people do not - in fact I would be bold enough to claim that when surveyed most people would pick a world more like the Federation (with no widespread AGI) over even the Culture, let alone an even more radical future.

Utopia isn't really a popularity contest is it? I'm not going to be convinced by popular opinion, and in an era where AGI is imminent, it's wiser to consider something akin to CEV rather than just tying one to a direct democracy vote. That would get ugly really fast!

&gt;I say aim for the Culture not because it is necessarily the 'best' future, but because it allows for anarchy. I know I'm a broken record writing this out, but if you don't like it and want to start your own society you are free to leave along with other likeminded people. Not just leave, but be given the necessary supplies to leave and thrive wherever you go.

You're well aware that this isn't completely true, the Culture restricts access to technology as well as the free agency of entities leaving it, at least if they're likely to do things that are no-nos. 

Similarly, it would take *one* motivated Mind or even a human to turn the entire intergalactic void into paradise. The fact that it hasn't happened in the entire history of the Culture shows that true freedom is restricted.

&gt;Philosophy, again; death is regarded as part of life, and nothing, including the universe, lasts forever. It is seen as bad manners to try and pretend that death is somehow not natural; instead death is seen as giving shape to life.

I didn't claim that death was *compulsory*, merely that a society that advanced where people *still* off themselves after such a cruelly short period of time is making a royal mess of things. That's a fundamentally Deathist approach, and while they're not fanatics about it, it's still highly suboptimal by my lights.

Also, it's funny how Banks writes that while stating the existence of the Sublime, with true Immortality right there. So the philosophy is nonsensical even in universe!",1661990451

We don't have a right to vote. We have a *mandate*. You HAVE to show up to vote. It's in the law.

*But what about my right not to vote?* I hear yall saying. FOOL. You only have to show up to the voting booth. You don't have submit an actual vote. You can just draw cats all over your ballot. Abstain if you wish, but you've gotta go anyway!

What does having a mandate do? Well, it means that we have people heading out into the middle of nowhere to reach the people who live there so they can cast their ballot. It means that you hear more from everyone, that it's not just the extremes voting. It also means voting days are on weekends, and set up in easy spots to reach like your local primary school.

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;What does this mean? How does a program define ""inspiration""? 

You tell me - you're making definitive claims about a technology you clearly don't understand, so how do you think it works?



&gt;You will never be able to perfectly trace a picture.
 
And neither will Midjourney perfectly recreate anything it sees. There's literally no distinction here. 

&gt;Generated AI art has great continuity between source and output. The only difference is that that continuity is obscured or overlaid by other images but still there. 

This simply isn't true. Enter in a simple prompt like ""Wallowa Mountains"" and you'll get varied outputs of mountains that may look similar to the Wallowas in different ways, but are clearly not the Wallowas in other ways, and the same image will never come out twice, even if you repeatedly upscale the same damn image. We're talking thousands of pixels the AI has to decide to fill in based on the context around them. 

Again, the AI does not use parts of images in generating its output. It gives you its *impression* of the images it sees. You seem to think it stitches together something ""new"" from pieces of existing content when it's actually a bit (understating obviously) more complicated than that.",1661990452

A confident pirate who was resurrected after half a century  
I drew a while ago!  
Character: Andreya Malcerius, Blade Dancer Pirate  
Andreya Malcerius was born into Raotian nobility and quickly  
realized she couldn't stand it. At sixteen, she stowed away on a ship to escape  
it all, ending up in the lawless city of Unconfito. There, a brothel owner took  
her in, not as a working girl but as security. After a year and a half, she  
began to feel the ocean's call and signed about the Ruin Wings, a feared pirate  
crew.   
For a year and a half, Andreya sailed with them. Then, her  
captain was contacted by Safron Mal, a Judge of Wyn, with a plea for aide in a  
siege that could decide the fate of the entire world. They sailed for the Old  
Continent, and there, on the field of battle, Andreya and her entire crew were  
slain, Andreya falling to a Meteor Swarm. Now, fifty years after the end of the  
siege, someone resurrected her and bound her soul to another. Andreya is  
currently trying to unravel it all and get used to her second life.

I managed to get off then doing therapy and jhanas combined and some insight deconstruction practice. I also have autoimmune hepatitis and mild sleep apnea. Some people even have cluster headaches like one of my friends. 

We should be wise about our medication usage since they did have side effects but we also should not ignore their advantages. 

Meditation also has side effects but has a generally clear upside if finding the right dosage, titration, and other parts of life are developed. 

I think that is super awesome that with medication you were able to more easily access deep concentration and get into jhanas or cessations. 

I personally think you should write more about your experience if you think it's helpful since I think it could be a great benefit to ppl hearing stories like this. 

People are averse to medications and there is some stigma against taking supplements or medications but I think that stigma is the wrong view and actually contributes to suffering. Kenneth folk in contemplative fitness begged his friend to take him to get SSRIs even after meditation, cessations, insight, etc. However, there is no shame in taking medication. 

The intersection between meditation &amp; mental health is gaining more ground but hearing more stories like this is uplifting. 

I'm curious at what point did you hit a breakthrough that made you manage to be able to rapidly run through and cycle through all 8 jhanas into cessation. 

That sounds awesome. Good luck to you and hope you move further.",1661990454

&gt; Aug 31 - Chip designer Nvidia Corp on Wednesday said that U.S. officials told it to stop exporting two top computing chips for artificial intelligence work to China, a move that could cripple Chinese firms&amp;#039; ability to carry out advanced work like image recognition and hamper a business Nvidia expects to generate $400 million in sales this quarter.

&gt; Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products.

&gt; Stacy Rasgon, a financial analyst with Bernstein, said the disclosure signaled that about 10% of Nvidia&amp;#039;s data center sales, which investors have closely monitored in recent years, were coming from China and that the hit to sales was likely &amp;quot;Manageable&amp;quot; for Nvidia.

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","Looks like you might have used Contrast so far. Ironically this leaves a paintjob lacking in (small-c) tonal contrast.

How to fix this? Manually add depth to the shadows and brightness to the highlights to accentuate what‚Äôs already there.

Glazing in some deep, dark, highly saturated colours (to complement or echo various parts of the existing scheme) should give more interesting shadows. I‚Äôd lean towards a dark warm magenta for the green; a dark cool violet for the blue armour; and something warm and autumnal near the base of the claws, take your pick of red-brown or rust etc.

Then you can harmonise the materials with choice of universal highlight colour. Perhaps using an ice yellow kind of colour would work well to mix into the blue skin (making some kind of teal) and ribbed pink areas (making more of a Caucasian flesh tone for the high points). It should also make for a less saturated yellow-green on the high points of the back chitin. If that took too much saturation out of any area (eg the green carapace), filtering something appropriate (like a yellow or green in this example) back over the top would preserve the highlights while also making it colourful AF, if that‚Äôs your jam!

Ice yellow would also work as-is as an edge highlight on the claws so it‚Äôs a good workhorse colour for this scheme. I think the GW equivalent might be Dorn Yellow?",1661990455

&gt; Aug 31 - Chip designer Nvidia Corp on Wednesday said that U.S. officials told it to stop exporting two top computing chips for artificial intelligence work to China, a move that could cripple Chinese firms&amp;#039; ability to carry out advanced work like image recognition and hamper a business Nvidia expects to generate $400 million in sales this quarter.

&gt; Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products.

&gt; Stacy Rasgon, a financial analyst with Bernstein, said the disclosure signaled that about 10% of Nvidia&amp;#039;s data center sales, which investors have closely monitored in recent years, were coming from China and that the hit to sales was likely &amp;quot;Manageable&amp;quot; for Nvidia.

"hattrick","t5_2sizd","I would say starting with GK training is a good idea, with the objective of selling them after a season or two to buy your long term trainees in another position (winger or scoring are good).

For example I would sell the keepers after they are 10-13 in GK and buy 6 good 17 yo forwards or 4 wingers, with the right specialities and decent secondary skills. Look for players with 17 and 10-30 days old to avoid the very expensive 17.3 yo and target small countries because even a seemingly average player might end up in the U21 national team and will sell for much more after a few seasons.

Keep training until desired level, sell half of the trainees and buy new ones for your next skill.",1661990457

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","You could watch lesbian porn XD that takes care of the ugly guy problem (though I do not actually agree that most guys in porn are ugly haha).

I think part of the problem is that no porn site exists with any sort tagging system that truly allows you to look for what you might want to watch, instead having only the broadest categories (based on race or age or very broad kinks). 

It gets better if you're one of the people like me who actually pay for their porn because I prefer story based stuff haha, because that broadens your options from the generic first dick-sucking, then doggy-style, then missionary, then cumshot formula of the cut-down stuff you find on free porn sites most of the time.

And someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the vaccine causes a lower viral load in someone who does become infected.  Coupled with the fact that there are no restrictions on in class sizes, social gatherings  community masking policies and the isolation period if you test positive, I think the University is trying to mitigate the possible effects in the community.  In addition, the second dose is likely much less effective at this point given the time period that has passed coupled with the new variants. 

The University seems to be trying to get ahead of massive outbreaks occurring within the University that may then spill over into the community at large.

It will be interesting to see the reasoning behind their decision.",1661990457

It's a matter of self preservation in their own minds now, they're protecting him as much or more than they'd protect themselves because if it turns out he's not the second coming then reality as they've known it for the past 6-8 years begins to collapse and that's worse than death to many of them.

The following off-season, getting JK and Gus more involved in the passing game as an outlet for Lamar was a major focal point. We have yet to see what that looks like because they were both hurt.

Your point on Lamar not being good enough to support a top tier RB is also bunk because he just did in 2020. Last year was the most injured team in recent history and the Ravens made Davonte Freeman look alive at times with Alejandro Villanueva starting at LEFT tackle.",1661990459

But I think venting in general is way different. If someone tells you to not be rude or if they tell you that whatever you're talking about is out of scope for the server, then your response shouldn't necessarily be ""I'll go disappear from Earth now"" or ""I guess nobody really gives a shit about me"" or ""this reminds me why I went to therapy for suicide"". Those are just so manipulative, and it's just gaslighting. Unfortunately, a lot of the servers I'm in don't really redirect users to venting chats, but even if they did, I don't know if they're necessarily the right place for someone who wants to abuse people like this.

If someone randomly says ""I'll go disappear from earth"", I'll for sure be concerned and I'll ask them what's wrong. But if they said that *because* a mod told them to keep it relevant and to be nice to others, it just hits different.",1661990459

Note that this benchmark puts it at about 80fps, so you wouldn't get getting the most out of that 144Hz screen. You can lower video settings, but I find with Apex you don't get as many gains as you'd normally expect from tweaking settings. Maybe expect 90fps with some in-game tweaking. 

You can also Google around for using config files for settings textures and such really low if you want a higher framerate still.

We have the same video card in a PC and it runs fine at high settings, but we only get 75fps on that screen. I haven't checked to see how easily it can go higher; that's the screen's max refresh rate. I believe that PC also has a slower CPU than yours.",1661990461

Sounds like you know what areas you need to work on and are already making progress üëç

This might sound patronizing but it‚Äôs sincere/effective advice that I received - just focus on embracing your journey. Celebrate your accomplishments- big and small - and do your best every day on steering the ship where you want to go; that‚Äôs really all you can ask of yourself. The rest is just luck üçÄ 

Enjoy that you‚Äôre in a field that is high in demand and lucrative for the foreseeable future üòä

I recommend looking through here at the prices, as all clinics and strains are different. 
The usual requirements are that you‚Äôve tried 2 different treatments (be it therapy or medications) that haven‚Äôt worked, BUT I hear not all clinics are as strict with that, but don‚Äôt quote me. (I‚Äôve been on multiple so it wasn‚Äôt an issue haha xD) 
Of course look through the link, but I‚Äôd recommend zerenia for something called ‚Äòproject twenty 21‚Äô, a scheme which gets you reduced prices on meds, Integro for a wider range of meds, these don‚Äôt have p21 prices but if you‚Äôre on benefits (or at least universal credit), you qualify for the ‚Äògrow access project‚Äô which gives you a reduced price on a specific ‚Äògrow‚Äô range of flower/oil. 
Cantourage are also caring, but are going through an influx of new patients atm so things are quite hectic over there, I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre taking new patients until next month. 
As for honesty, yes I don‚Äôt see the problem with being honest, I think a lot of people are so that they can list what‚Äôs worked. I mentioned that I used a little as a teenager on occasion, it didn‚Äôt seem to set any alarms off xD I know a lot bring it up.

&gt; Aug 31 - Chip designer Nvidia Corp on Wednesday said that U.S. officials told it to stop exporting two top computing chips for artificial intelligence work to China, a move that could cripple Chinese firms&amp;#039; ability to carry out advanced work like image recognition and hamper a business Nvidia expects to generate $400 million in sales this quarter.

&gt; Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products.

&gt; Stacy Rasgon, a financial analyst with Bernstein, said the disclosure signaled that about 10% of Nvidia&amp;#039;s data center sales, which investors have closely monitored in recent years, were coming from China and that the hit to sales was likely &amp;quot;Manageable&amp;quot; for Nvidia.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","a lot is in the manner in which it's communicated. I've had similar conversations and worded them to come off as nonchalant as possible, and not something I'm proud of. like ""oh I just lost interest for awhile."" it helps I don't believe in abstinence (as I think it's naive to predict your life that far into the future), so I sometimes can say ""maybe it's a phase."" but it depends on who I'm talking to, because most actually congratulate me these days now that I'm in my mid 30s if I quit a substance.

if you're attaching your spiritual beliefs to why you've stopped alcohol when you explain, I think people are justified in perceiving a superior/inferior dynamic. you stopped something you think is bad for you via some sort of spiritual awakening. put yourself in their shoes before your ""awakening"" (whatever it was): some friend you party with suddenly says they're not going to party with you anymore because they found god and substance abuse is a sin. I have a hard time believing you'd brush it off like nothing.

people are definitely justified in their feelings towards you saying now that you've ""leveled up"" spiritually, you don't listen to rap. actually, wait... for one, you're admitting to ""leveling up"", that coincides with being a better person than you were before in some way. so if people thought they related to you before, they can't now that you're better than the person they related to.   
but imo nixing a music genre for spiritual purposes is more leveling down if anything. why does rap offend you spiritual mind? there's a ton of spirituality across the genre. seems odd to consider ANY genre of music short of nazi music to be a ""bad habit"". that sounds more like an issue of how the genre informs your ego (just to clarify since we're in the psychonaut sub: ego is not a bad thing, I'm not using it in a negative context here).",1661990464

Night baking is a busy and filled with work shift, while day baking is slower paced, but neither require you to interact with people really, the bakers get left alone their entire shift, and the stores I've seen at least allow bakers to have their own radio or headphones/earbuds. I found it to be pleasant work but as mentioned all over the rest of the comments, Panera has shit management and a corporate that loves to try to act like they're a loving and for the employees based company, but they aren't, Panera will take every opportunity to fuck you in my experience. They refuse to hire enough staff and when people complain, they just straight up don't care, the GMs are getting bonuses to line their pockets for keeping staffing low so as long as you pass inspection they really don't care. I just recently quit/got let go at my Panera job after 2 years due to all the bs, A few coworkers and I (I was a manager aswell as a baker btw) went up the corporate ladder above our shit bosses head and you know what corporate had to say about a literal essay with pictures and evidence included? They told us that the fact that we felt the need to go above our stores manager is insubordination and let all 3 of us go on the spot. Our attorney said with all the stuff we had, it could basically be an open and shut case, if only the 3 of us had a few grand to pool together for said case.

"FeminismUncensored","t5_3otol5","Please review both what I linked above and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoetic_men%27s_movement).

&gt;In the mythopoetic movement, the desire to be spiritual and yet manly is also a factor in the way the group understands the nature of gender and relationships between the sexes. The mythopoetic movement tends to regard gender as biological realities, ""hardwired"" into the psyches of men and women. This gender essentialism is consistent with the Jungian philosophy undergirding the movement. Mythopoetic men thus speak of the need to recover ""deep masculinity,"" to distinguish what they regard as genuine or mature masculinity **from the problematic toxic masculinity of immature males.\[11\]**  
&gt;  
&gt;Because most men no longer perform masculine rituals, **mythopoets assert that men have mutated into destructive, hypermasculine chauvinists, or, in the opposite direction, have become too feminized**. The mythopoetic men performed rituals at these gatherings, which were meant to imitate those performed by tribal societies when men initiated boys into a deeply essential natural manhood. The movement emphasized the importance of including multiple generations of men in the rituals, so that the men could learn about masculinity from those who were older and wiser.\[8\]

Basically, the original was highly based on gender essentialism. Ignoring that, there's two issues with men contemporaneous to and according to the men's mythopoetic movement ‚Äî feminized men and toxically masculine men. Two different concepts in two different directions. ""feminisation"" (or what you label as ""simping"") is not related to the concept of ""toxic masculinity"" except as a foil.",1661990465

As far as light levels....it depends on which way the window is facing and your location.

If you're in the northern hemisphere, if the window faces east or north....it's great in this spot if you keep up with watering needs especially east-facing.

If the west, depends on if there are trees outside filtering the light, etc. You might want to move the plant back one or two feet depending on what is outside.

South-facing with the blinds, being that close to the window if you have deep roof eaves...then it's probably fine.

That much foliage, root mass, light levels and seasonal influences....you'll need to keep an eye on the moisture levels. They can be very thirsty plants.

&gt; Aug 31 - Chip designer Nvidia Corp on Wednesday said that U.S. officials told it to stop exporting two top computing chips for artificial intelligence work to China, a move that could cripple Chinese firms&amp;#039; ability to carry out advanced work like image recognition and hamper a business Nvidia expects to generate $400 million in sales this quarter.

&gt; Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if Chinese firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products.

&gt; Stacy Rasgon, a financial analyst with Bernstein, said the disclosure signaled that about 10% of Nvidia&amp;#039;s data center sales, which investors have closely monitored in recent years, were coming from China and that the hit to sales was likely &amp;quot;Manageable&amp;quot; for Nvidia.

"RepTime","t5_37dr6","You‚Äôll get shit on over here because people in the sun don‚Äôt like answering questions that can easily be answered by reading, I kinda agree but sometimes it can be overwhelming.

Anyway, I think the submariner 126610LN from VSF is a safe choice. You can also get their Datejust 41, black or blue to be safe.

The rest you‚Äôll have to learn yourself by going through QC posts, etc.

If you don‚Äôt want to do that, you can contact a TD with good communication who doesn‚Äôt mind answering questions (Eric from Geektime or Steve from theonewatches).

There is also something known as the NWBIG (not worth buying in gen) list which is part of the pinned guide post on this subreddit.

Even after the first date if there‚Äôs no connection just be upfront and truthful. But it seems ghosting, fading etc is still the go to for most women. The excuse of ‚Äúwomen don‚Äôt like to be confrontational‚Äù is bs because it‚Äôs literally just sending one text. Maybe they‚Äôve had abusive past men that took it poorly? I don‚Äôt know but the waiting and wondering really sucks. I‚Äôll usually send a polite follow up and read through the lines.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;To the Christians who say evolution does not contradict Christianity.

They're not making any claim about the soul, when they say this. The soul still comes from god, and depending on who you ask, god still ""breathes life into"" the body when the body first takes breath. (Now then: even for evangelicals who literally believe this, most of them are anti-abortion, so... sure, it still makes no sense, but that's par for the course with evangelical christians).

They're talking about the physical evolution of life on the planet, eventually ending up where we are today, with the extant plant, animal, and other species we see all around us, including humans.

But humans are still a special case. They still take the whole ""god gave man dominion"" business seriously, which is why so many of them are anti-environmental regulation, and convinced climate change is a hoax. To allow that humans are destroying the ecosystem would be to admit that either a) the Bible is wrong (we're not going to do that), or b) god's a capricious asshole, and doesn't particularly care if we end up with a planet we can't live on. (Some number of them, particularly the ones who are actually more scientifically literate may actually believe this, but they'll never say so out loud.)

Most of them parrot some version of a claim that ""even if there is a problem, god will take care of it"" to the extent that they're willing to allow that any environmental impact from humans ever happens, at all.

&gt;‚ÄúAs a Christian, I believe that there is a creator in God who is much bigger than us,‚Äù Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) told constituents last week at a town hall in Coldwater, Mich. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm confident that, if there‚Äôs a real problem, he can take care of it.‚Äù

Anyway.

They're not making any claim that souls evolve. They're just saying the whole business of god fashioning Adam out of clay ""isn't meant to be taken literally."" They accept, more or less, that evolution and natural selection ""ends up"" with humans, as god's divine plan, and he then imbues them with souls.",1661990467

Seriously tho, we kind of are. I mean, ...we ARE all gonna die eventually, but i'm not talking about that kind of doomed. Things will progressively get worse and worse, and there will be periods where it seems like things are getting better, but that's just a temporary illusion.

And Trump/Trumpism **isn't** the cause-- we've been on this track for a loooong time now, for at least the last 20-25 years, maybe longer-- but he's (so far) been the most obvious sign of societal decline/collapse. (For me it was clear when Congress, the constitutional check on executive power run amok \[amok, amok, amok\], voted for preemptive war; but that's just me)

Just... enjoy things now and be kind to others, or at least try not to add to the suffering of others, and try not to worry too much about the state of the world over the next few decades. In the grand scheme of things, there's little to nothing ""we"", the commonfolk, can really do.",1661990467

I was excited to start pur√©es at 4 months because I was tired of constantly chasing her with a bottle and essentially feeding her in a semi-asleep state. Well, she was as dubious about the cereal/pur√©e as she was about the bottle. I don‚Äôt think she ate more than a couple of teaspoons at a time for the first couple of months. It wasn‚Äôt a complete waste of time because she got to sit in the high chair and play with the spoon, but the volume wasn‚Äôt there to have any impact on her weight. She only started going up on the growth chart once we graduated to multiple meals of solids a day. We mostly do BLW, but it‚Äôs because my daughter refuses to be spoon fed and wants to be in control of her meals. I don‚Äôt think there is any harm in introducing some cereal or pur√©e as long as you keep your expectations low and access that the bottles are here to stay until the baby is one. It absolutely gets better though! I think I reached a point around the 9-month mark when I stopped obsessively monitoring my baby‚Äôs bottle intake because she ate enough solids during the day.",1661990467

"homelab","t5_2ubz7","&gt; I‚Äôm not insisting anything

You started this off by _insisting_ about the legal distinction between libel and slander, then followed it up with juvenile ""Words mean things"" retorts.

&gt; in fact you are insisting that words don‚Äôt mean what their specific definitions describe them to mean

Quite the opposite, actually.  And I'm also the one that gets to teach you about the fact that language evolves over time and the meaning of words can change.  If you don't believe me, look up the definition for ""tit"".  It didn't always mean breasts, it actually used to be synonymous with ""bit"".  It's where we get the name ""tit"" for some birds.

The point I'm making is that yes, words mean things.  But those things can change over time as the speakers of the language understand the word differently.  You should look into [Linguistic Prescriptivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription) and [Linguistic Descriptivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_description), they're pitted against one another because the former is concerned with laying down immutable rules of how languages are written/spoken/etc., and the latter simply describes how language is used.  A prescriptivist linguist might tell you that you're wrong for using ""u"" instead of ""you"" in a sentence, while a descriptivist linguist would simply note that some people use ""u"" in place of ""you"".

&gt; All I said is that ‚Äúwords mean things‚Äù. Go look them up and if you‚Äôre still upset get the dictionary amended.

I'm not upset.  Are you perhaps mad that you don't understand the evolution of language?  It's perfectly okay, no one knows everything.  For example, I don't know the exact mass of the sun.",1661990467

"TrueOffMyChest","t5_2yuqy","I lost my daughter at 25 weeks. This was back in 1998 when the technology was not there to intervene whatsoever. I was also 16. I will tell you that every year on her birthday I think of her. I, like you, had to deliver her, got to hold her and even held a burial and she now has her own cemetery plot in my hometown that I don't even get to visit often. I will say that when I got pregnant again 7 years later I was TERRIFIED but in the end, I ended up having the most beautiful little girl ever. The trauma from my first was almost too much to bear.  I almost died when I had her. I was hospitalized for 5 days before she was inevitably born sleeping (they were hoping that bed rest would help) and I developed a serious infection. I could have died. The whole ordeal was traumatic, yes, because of my age for sure,  but also, I was ready for her. My parents were ready to help so I could finish school. I loved her. So...now here are my ""words of wisdom"".

Time doesn't heal all wounds. That's a crock of shit, sorry. But time does make things easier, absolutely.  My first pregnancy after my loss was scary and nerve wrecking but it worked out. I went on to have another child 6 years after that and it was the easiest, most joyous pregnancy. No, you won't forget. Yes, you may need some therapy to help you through this. But this does not mean it will be the end of motherhood for you. I used to tell myself it was just not meant to be at that time. That some divine intervention put me through that so I would end up where (and who)  I was meant to be today. (I am not religious, so none of this ""gods plan"" stuff... Just FATE.) I believe she watches over my family and sometimes I dream of her as the 22 year old she would be today.

It's not just ""serve evil master to serve evil master"" it's also an added ""if these fuckers succeed in their mission, or, if I disobey master Dialga, I am going to die.""
A sense of self preservation even if he's kind of a cowardly bastard lol.

I wouldn't say he's the best of all time nor is he redeemable, but again a lot of games I've played have BBEG set ups or I haven't finished it yet- or, in the case of others games, it's been long enough I don't remember motives for them.

Edit: on a similar note, Marx from Kirby. Everyone talks about Magolor for the Big Betrayal but this mad lad not only did that first in a way, he managed to make the sun and the moon and fight to get what he wanted and then due to his wish he basically controlled Nova from the start.
Also his wings are pretty, he's a chaos gremlin jester, and while his motive isn't as great compared to the other villains there I think it's a better evil to be evil reason than just ""I'm gonna steal all the food, that good with you"" and ""time to go rule the universe because I can""",1661990468

She also freaks out at dogs because illegal off leash dogs kept running up and getting in her face.

Our trainer said to wait 8-10 weeks for training. Until then I guess just try to keep everything as calm and chill for your dog so her anxiety and stress levels can drop.

She went on about diabetes and blood pressure. That kid needed to hear that extra weight isn't good for her, and that they would sit with her and discuss healthier food choices and an exercise program that the daughter would be excited about. I think Mom just took the first step in alienating her daughter, and Dad didn't want to be party to it. Mom should've talked it through with him first. It could have had a very different ending.

The reason this idea involves a logical contradiction is that it claims God is all-powerful (inasmuch as he creates the rock) and not all-powerful (inasmuch as he can‚Äôt lift the rock) in the same respect at the same place and time. Since this is a violation of the principle of non-contradiction, it cannot be.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I understand.  It sounds like you're grieving the loss of things that are important &amp; dear to you-- achieving home ownership as a single woman, your daily independent life before you met your SO, &amp; your cat.  That's a lot to process, with a lot of sadness and emotion tied to each thing.  No wonder you are feeling a blankness, and then to add on the extra mental load of trying to fix broken things, when you are feeling emotionally broken- I can understand why you might feel like you're stuck in one spot.  

Can you have a conversation with your SO about how you're still grieving the loss of a lot of things that were important to you and that when they point out more problems, you feel an added burden of having to fix these problems, when you just don't have the mental &amp; emotional space to do that bc you are dealing with your own grief?

I completely empathize with you.  I waited to become a mom at 39, and got married shortly before my kid was born.  9 months before that, I had created a space and an independent life that I loved.  I could wake up whenever, work on my hobbies whenever, cook whatever I wanted, and go out in my neighborhood and walk miles &amp; miles and feel completely fulfilled as a person.  Once I became a mom, all of that freedom &amp; independence went away and I grieved the loss of my 'old life'  We all go through changes in life- some for the better- but that doesn't mean that we can't feel sadness for the loss of our past lives. It's ok to feel that way.",1661990471

I was working help desk one day when an army buddy sent me a text to apply to an opening. Because of the small community I got the job with him as a reference.

Went from 40k to 75k a year after my two week's notice.

If I were to do it again I would have joined earlier:

Do 20 years active duty time, and retire from the military at 37 with free health care. Then do another 20 working for the state...another pension on top of the one you're getting. Retire completely at 57.

On top of that is you can get school paid for. I knew a lady I worked with who had multiple bachelor's degrees through the military just because she liked going to school.

But if you can get into an IT field (yes, I'm biased because I'm in IT myself) you get sent to schools through the military as part of your job. Part of that is getting IT certs as well.

I get Udemy for business for free through the army. So, I can choose anything on their platform and study it if I want. If I want to learn SQL, Active Directory, programming, CNC machining, excel, AWS, SEC+, hacking I can.

That's only one of the many benefits. I could go on and on. But again, the school system demonizes the military. Kids these days look at it like people did back during the Vietnam war when those soldiers were treated like crap. There's so much misinformation, and biased attitudes it's incredible.",1661990471

"hatemyjob","t5_2t80c","Like my morning job at schlotzskys. I‚Äôve been here almost 5 years. At first it was great. The atmosphere‚Ä¶the people I worked with‚Ä¶the customers. Then about 2.5 years ago it got bought out. They ran breakfast but any good business will promote its product to draw people in but no they refused. I saw 3 ads inside 30 minutes &amp; nothing since. 3 ads within 1day within a year. That‚Äôs not getting any customers. They were having us order breakfast supplies which cost $100/month per store but we were lucky to sell $20/month in breakfast. So you can see the flaw in their plan. But me trying to tell them fell on deaf ears. After a year they stopped breakfast. They moved opening hours from 8am to 10am. Customers asked why the change &amp; im not going to lie.  One customer told me you had breakfast? I didn‚Äôt know or I would‚Äôve gotten some. Not long after we started calzones. People love them! We were doing buy one get pizzas for a LONG time. My base store got shut down because By the company we weren‚Äôt making much money. Well that‚Äôs obvious when you have 2 new store on either side of us pulling customers away. July 28 we had a store meeting with corporate. Corporate saying ‚Äúwell this store isn‚Äôt making money, we have to think about the company as a whole so we‚Äôre shutting this store down effective immediately.‚Äù I‚Äôm only glad I wasn‚Äôt drunk. I was informed at the meeting since I‚Äôve been one of the longest tenured employees I have a weeks paid vacation but I need to give a two week notice before using it. We was transferred to another store. First day there I inform the GM who I already knew that I would take my vacation &amp; the time frame. She changed my pay rate higher as well. The two weeks go by &amp; I remind her Monday starts my vacation. She says no it doesn‚Äôt. I said uh yes it does. She said she put the paperwork in &amp; our regional manager denied it ‚Äúbecause your not full time.‚Äù I was irritated. I told my GM ‚Äúyou know they refused full time at the other store! They told me I had it so why say I have it if I don‚Äôt?!‚Äù Then she reveals regional also declined your raise. WHAT?! Why?! No reason but she was totally ok with giving herself a raise. Apparently this regional manager doesn‚Äôt want anyone to have a raise because she feels she deserves a raise. Now here‚Äôs the kicker‚Ä¶my hours have been cut‚Ä¶drastically. Old store they were always complaining about labor. Labor wasn‚Äôt an issue until you morons messed everything up with breakfast. So since my last GM I‚Äôve not only had my manager position ripped away but I got denied my vacation AND my raise. Why?! Because schlotzskys is a greedy corporation who are run by inept morons. I‚Äôve said it before my ‚Äúnew‚Äù store isn‚Äôt going to last much longer. You take your #1 promo that draws people in &amp; make it so it‚Äôs app only. Considering most customers are elderly &amp; don‚Äôt understand how to use the app. I used to think they were intentionally trying to kill the business but now I‚Äôm positive their just too stupid to run a business. You take your most loyal employee from 25 hours to 10.5 hours? Someone who knows the company day to day practices like the back of his hand &amp; essentially slap him in the face.",1661990472

One trick I use to help me out : I put my silent alarm 5 minutes before my actual alarm, this way I'm actually a little awake when the clock goes off, so I hear it and I'm able to wake up.

He's notorious for both good and bad reasons and his name is on the cover of common guide books.  When I met him he was trying to hold down a job a the tuolumne store but I'm pretty sure he got fired and he just seemed off.  He was persona non-grata at parties and gatherings due to bad behavior.... just wild and reckless shit.  

People didn't really like him, but he was respected simply for his climbing and dedication.  But people definitely didn't want him around.    

I don't know the details of his alleged assaults, but I do know National Parks is the feds, and if the feds indicted and arrested him, 6 years after the incidents, they're pretty damn sure they can get a conviction.  I doubt anyone will be rushing to his aid with expensive lawyers either.  He's gonna get thrown to the wolves.... and if the allegations are true, I guess he deserves it.",1661990473

"Animesuggest","t5_2ssl0","Your following a similiar path to when I started 4 years ago, so going by the ones you watched so far I would recommend these:

One Piece - I love this show but it is extremely long with over a 1000 episodes, so personally I would say pick it up and have it has the anime you can fall back to watch (if you like it) when deciding what to watch next.

Dororo

One Punch Man

My Hero Academia 

Hunter x Hunter

Black Clover

Parasyte - Highly recommend but for a newcomer might need to have some patience, episode 6 is where it truly kicks off.

Fate/Zero &gt; Fate/UBW

Vinland Saga - Highly recommended

Tanya The Terrible - Highly recommended 

That time I got reincarnated has a slime

Erased

Summertime Render - Still ongoing, highly recommended 

Made In Abyss - Highly recommended but has a newcomer you will need patience to get used to the anime style and the way it is played out, but this show has it all, action, mystery, gore (semi), very wierd moments what aren't usually used in anime and no fan service.

Code Gease 

Konosuba

Tower Of God

Mob Psycho 100 - Highly recommended, especially for newcomers who want some beautiful action.

Classroom Of The Elite

Steins Gate - Again not the best for newcomers has it takes a long time to get going, but when it does it is amazing.

For now I think this will do, I have a couple on my tongue what the names aren't coming to my head, most of the ones I have mentioned follow a similar trend to the others you have seen, but I have also thrown in a few other genres has well.",1661990473

"turbo","t5_2t3c4","Hard to say, there are many variables that go into a build. 

 Turbo type and size, finding a turbo exhaust manifold, adding a wastegate if the turbo does not have an integrated one on it already (most do not).

Custom larger diameter exhaust system.

Larger injectors as well as a tune if your ECU allows it or a piggyback ECU to intercept and skew the signals in order retard ignition timing and add the proper amount of fuel.

Installing a wideband 02 sensor so you can monitor the AFRs.

Installing head studs and replacing the head gasket for a MLS type.

And that's for a low boost system that uses stock internal components.  

It gets expensive real quick to do it right.  

For example a decent turbo alone from VS racing for your application would probably be $400 ish or so for a journal type non ball bearing style.

It would easily be a few thousand if paying a shop to do it considering all the parts you will need.

If you can find a cheap ebay kit thats the cheapest but the turbos are usually crap and you still need tuning, a wastegate, exhaust, etc for safe operation.",1661990473

&gt;*""That evening I checked out a nightclub that was known to be frequented by criminal types, and was in fact run by criminals. It wasn't the most pleasant place to spend an evening; the food and drinks were terrible, and the entertainment wasn't much better. I guess it's hard to find criminals who have really mastered big band instruments. But it was a place an investigator like myself could pick up some leads. I hung around the bar, listening to the various furtive conversations that were going on around me. A couple of guys near me were planning a big heist, apparently. After awhile, they noticed I was listening in, partly because I kept asking them to repeat things. I‚Äôve got to quit doing that. That‚Äôs a real tipoff.""*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""The next day, a dead turtle was left on my doorstep as a warning. I couldn't figure out as a warning for what, and I guess whoever was watching me picked up on that, because the next morning there was another dead turtle, but this one had several sheets of paper glued to it's back leg. The pieces of paper contained a long footnoted explanation of all the symbolism involved. It didn't make a lot of sense to me. The turtle was the ""turtle of inquisitiveness"" and the cheese smeared on it's shell meant something, and the little cowboy boots on its feet meant something. Everything about this animal meant something apparently to whoever sent it. I still didn't get what it was all about. The next morning there was no turtle.

I had the exact same baby tooth removed when I was about 35. The adult tooth finally started to come in around age 33 and it was nearly in the roof of my mouth.

I had both teeth pulled in one harrowing, insane dental visit. Over the next year I had a titanium post added for an implant. I now have a big weird fake tooth and a bunch of discolored gums where the teeth were removed.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","So, uh, who pays for childcare if your wife goes back to work? Does it come out of her inheritance? Both your incomes? And who pays for the household cleaning, etc, that may need to be done if she works? 

The way you speak about your wife‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not great. The disability you dismiss, the health changes pregnancy causes you dismiss, you focus more on your desire not to work than her ‚Äúmore than just not wanting to work‚Äù issues, and you seem uninterested in considering who would take care of the kid if you both work. That inheritance gave you a LOT - a house, two cars, retirement fund, etc - and you‚Äôre upset about having to still work instead of glad you now have less work as a couple (which means you don‚Äôt have to pay for childcare or do as much household work) and likely less years of work left until retirement. That inheritance was hers, not a shared marital asset - she gave you a new car, a house paid in full, a retirement fund, and free childcare, and you‚Äôre quibbling over comparatively VERY small amounts of money, mad you still have to work instead of her fighting through her multiple medical disabilities to work. How much more would you be spending in rent if she hadn‚Äôt bought that house? Would you be ok with her being a SAHM who pays her own way out of inheritance while you two are still paying rent or mortgage instead of owning put right? 

I‚Äôm going to say YTA here because it‚Äôs certainly not ESH. You seem to have a very entitled, short sighted, and self centered perspective that doesn‚Äôt take into consideration all you‚Äôve been *given* by your wife OR the financial costs of her returning to work. Stingy with money for clothes after she gave you a car, house, and just had a baby‚Ä¶ yeah, the more I think about it, the worse you look. Maybe she should charge you rent for living in the house she bought and lease payments for the car she bought.",1661990474

But, in opposite, it's also an interesting experience because you get to talk with yourself.

It can be terrifying and it can be beautiful, it can feel so frustrating you want to die or it can feel like a game. It feels like excess of sense a lot too. Everything has a deeper meaning. You can figure out stuff you never saw before, but you can also fall into conspiracy bullshit or like, absurd ideas that are very very elaborated despite being absolutely shitty. It's complicated.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","The closest I've come to losing that sort of habit was through some casual reading on Buddhism, not ADHD science. Super short form, from memory, it references the illusion of satisfactoriness. The mistaken belief that IF we can (imaginary result), we will be satisfied and able to move on. IF we have the computer that doesn't upset us with metrics of bad performance, THEN we'll be okay. 

Even a little bit of introspection reveals that such a condition never ends up existing, and the satisfaction is forever elusive and never achieved. 

The twist is that the pain we feel in this is not from the computer letting us down, or the standards being too high. It's our belief that such satisfaction is even possible to achieve that makes us suffer - more specifically our attachment to that belief. 

Instead of grieving the ongoing failure to achieve satisfactoriness, we can briefly grieve the belief that it was possible. Unattached to that belief, we can remind ourselves when that feeing arises, that we've already figured this out and the pursuit has been called off. We can still want a good tool to do our work, but the conviction that a perfect tool will make things okay is no longer the root of our worry. 

I will add that I may have gotten all of this wrong and that I've made assumptions which may not apply in your case. But I do like the story.",1661990475

&gt; It comes after other public incidents, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau being pelted by gravel by anti-vaccine mandate protesters during the last federal election and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh being verbally harassed outside an event earlier this year.

&gt; In June, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino - who has himself faced death threats - announced that Canadian parliamentarians will be given mobile alarms after several politicians publicly criticised the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for not adequately addressing their security concerns.

&gt; Ms Freeland has said the weekend incident will not stop her from returning to Alberta, which is &amp;quot;Filled with kind and welcoming people&amp;quot;, adding &amp;quot;One unpleasant incident doesn&amp;#039;t change that&amp;quot;.

I would compare it to race play. It is possible that some people are using the kink to hide being actually racist, but it‚Äôs not the kink in itself, it‚Äôs because they are racist.

From what I‚Äôve seen it does have to do with changing of identity, as the partner does not really recognize the other as male.

"ResearchChemSourcing","t5_6fny76","The most potent benzos by weight (mg for mg), are flubromazolam followed by flunitrazolam.

Equivalent to 10 mg diazepam:

Flubromaz 75 ug  (0.075 mg)

Flunitraz 100 ug (0.1 mg)

Clonaz 200 ug (0.2 mg)

Triazolam 250 ug (0.25 mg)

Flualp 250 ug (0.25 mg)

I personally think that triazolam (Halcion) is more potent mg for mg than flualprazolam. Either that, or flualprazolam is more of an anxiolytic as opposed to a sedative-hypnotic, like triazolam.  Despite its name,  flualp is actually more closely related to triazolam than it is to alprazolam (chemical structure).

Bromazolam (like estazolam) is less potent compared to a lot of other triazolo benzos, with about 2 mg being roughly equal to 10 mg diazepam or 0.5 mg alprazolam. Nitrazolam (this is the triazolo derivative of nitrazepam), is amazing. It is 2x more potent than Bromazolam, with 1 mg nitrazolam being equivalent to 10 mg diazepam or 0.5 alprazolam.  However, it has way stronger sedative-hypnotic, muscle relaxant, and amnesic properties relative to alprazolam or bromazolam.

Flutemazepam (fluorinated temazpam) is a VERY strong hypnotic, muscle relaxant, and anxiolytic. There is only 1 Chinese vendor which manufactures it, and they just recently began that making this. I have yet to try this it, but from what I've read‚Äîit is heavy duty and might be more of a knockout type benzo. If it were to be used in medicine, it would likely be indicated for severe insomnia, the most severe states of anxiety and panic attacks, as well as for psychotic breaks, especially due to stimulant psychosis.

They had Nitemazepam, another temazepam analogue (it is the 7-nitro instead of 7-chloro analogue), or you can also say it's a nimetazepam derivative: 3-hydroxy-nimetazepam. Nimetazepam and temazepam are the parent drugs, and both are metabolites of nitemazepam. China BANNED Nitemazepam just this past May 2022.

Both Temazepam and Nimetazepam are highly recreational benzos, so Nitemazepam was the one of the best benzos I've ever tried, and I've tried every benzo available in the Canadian and US market, plus most RC benzos.",1661990475

"ChainsawMan","t5_rmtrq","As someone who did say it was average, here are my reasonings for it:

1) Whilst seeing Denji again, and getting a glimpse into his character for this part, are all good, and humorous, and at times meme worthy, it does kinda go against the first few chapters of this part in how far the in story mythos of Chainsaw Man has spread amongst the public, and how Asa and the War Devil were trying to track Denji down. Honestly with how the prior chapter dealt with Denji's reappearance was perfect for this part, especially when you consider that an option was available for how the story could progress (ie, despite the amount of casualties and property damage, the media was continuing to claim Chainsaw Man a hero to be praised, propping up his achievements, whilst not even acknowledging his failures, which could be seen as some lingering form of Makima's power, but as we the readers have been following Asa's story, and see the world from her perspective, it could be taken that the War Devil is pulling back the illusion from her eyes, and is showing her the true face of this 'Hero')

2) Whilst Masutato brought up some good points in his discussion with prometheusunending, that's really only something that can be fully appreciated in future chapters/rereads of the entire finished series, so to have a low, buildup chapter, focusing on a different character than the one we've been following for at least 3 chapters, isn't really endearing enough, to me, to rank this chapter higher, when it's the most recent chapter available to us (I felt the exact same during the first chapter of Asa's story)

3) I'm a simple person, doesn't deny myself the simple pleasures in life, but even then, JUST eating cake in a cafe (not an unnatural cake, not during a siege, not with anything overly dramatic, JUST a cake, IN a cafe), will rank average at best for me (and yes I know that the chapter is more cerebral than action, but with the above point about it being build-up, then the cake eating is the most 'dramatic' bit of the chapter)",1661990477

The Assassin's Creed series has quite a few games out, and each one is a stealth-based action adventure featuring beautifully crafted historical setting. The story itself can be a bit repetitive and strange, but those settings keep bringing me back. (I'm currently playing ""Assassin's Creed: Origins"", set in Egypt during Cleopatra's time)

Skyrim is several years old, but it keeps getting re-released for a reason. It's easy to pick up and a lot of fun.

&gt; It comes after other public incidents, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau being pelted by gravel by anti-vaccine mandate protesters during the last federal election and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh being verbally harassed outside an event earlier this year.

&gt; In June, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino - who has himself faced death threats - announced that Canadian parliamentarians will be given mobile alarms after several politicians publicly criticised the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for not adequately addressing their security concerns.

To me he's just the least interesting. He literally only craves power out of some weird desire for superiority, except unlike DIO, we see very little humanity from him. He kills humans AND Pillar Men and wants to stand alone at the top. 

Out of every main villain, he has little in that regard that actually makes him stand out. For me, at least. His power-up is the most memorable aspect of his character, to me, alongside his defeat.

So to me, yes, he is technically one of the worst villains in the series in that he doesn't impress me. At least as far as main villains go. But I don't think it's fair to act like people rank him below randos like Zucchero or Sale from Part 5, either. Those guys are just greedy and that's... About it.",1661990478

Do not confuse things. Checking if the list is auto-updating is just to verify if Windows is detecting something is being plugged at all. If the device is being recognized as an actual controller it's then another story.

Do the following:

1. Create your own post in the sub since it's probably a different issue
    - Please, use a good title and describe your issue so all the information required to understand your problem is there
2. Provide the information below in the new post:

------------

provide the following info in your new post:

1. Have your controller connected
1. Press `Win + X` then select ""Device Manager"" on the appearing Menu
1. On the top of Device Manager, go to the ""View"" tab then select ""Devices by **CONTAINER**""
1. Locate your controller in the list (it should be named Wireless Controller)
1. Expand the controller's container then send a screenshot
    - You can send images/screenshot here by first uploading them to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or other similar image sharing service then sending the image link here
    - If there is more than 1 make sure to expand all of them
1. Also, send a screenshot Windows' `Game Controllers` list (joy.cpl)

I wouldn't make the assumption.  I've seen lots of companies with pretty shitty processes yet was still making money hand over fist.   

I've worked at a company, albeit not ""big corporation"", where lots of stuff was very off the cuff and misunderstandings happened from time to time.  Some places are just unorganized vs doing things maliciously.",1661990479

Met a boy on Grindr and we met up at the beach. He pulled out a joint and asked if I wanted to smoke. I told him in my broken Spanish that I never smoked it before. I remember him laughing and said ""espera, su vida va a cambiar hoy"" (your life is going to change today) and we smoked it. 

I remember staring at the waves and the sunset. And I remember thinking to myself that it was probably one of the best experiences I have had up until then. I also remember staring into his eyes unable to look at anything else. 

Afterwards he took me to go get some Chilean sushi (one of the best places to get sushi, seriously. Go to any Chilean sushi restaurant. Your life will be changed.) And I SMASHED that sushi.

Meeting people to date becomes harder as many people at the age she will be when she can go out will be in serious relationships (or even married).  She will have a hard time with her chosen career with years of nothing to show for it.  It's going to be a few year break that will make it nearly impossible for her to have the life she might have imagined for herself.

You are also not doing this based on logic or data - your statement about wearing gloves in the grocery store indicates that you have absolutely not kept up with the research.  So basically your decisions are based on fear, yours.  Why are you allowed to make emotional decisions and she can not?",1661990481

"nonmonogamy","t5_2rc24","To me it sounds like he was horny, you said ""no"" and so he went out. Whether he initially intended to hook up with someone is unclear, but it sounds to me like he was still horny and so it did. I don't think that was exactly smart on his end, because it does make the situation appear that he did in fact go out to hookup because he didn't get sex from you, but I also would give him the benefit of the doubt on this.

What is absolutely 100% not okay is him not using condoms. Then him calling you and saying that he'll get tested ""if you want me to."" It sounds like he *doesn't care* that he broke the agreement, and is trying to shrug it off and put the onus on you.

I get that he may prefer not to use condoms. Most people don't! *I* don't like the feel of condoms, and I have a vagina! But this was an agreement he made with you and if nothing else, it's important to you, the person he cares about and is in a relationship with. That's extremely hurtful. I would be LIVID. It isn't just about the broken agreement, it's how he is acting about breaking it.

Do you feel sitting down with him and explaining that may help? You are both young, so I think there is plenty of room to learn from this and grow, *if* he is interested in keeping the relationship. And it would entail this not happening again. Because at that point it no longer becomes a mistake and is intentional.",1661990481
"poker","t5_2qhix","Taxes shouldn't affect how you play hands. You're not taxed after every winning hand, just on the end of year's net profits. This means you're basically only taxed on your EV, and a +EV multiplied by 0.8 is still +EV.

You might be wondering, what if you've had a profitable year, are playing on New Year's Eve, are dealt your final hand of the year and find yourself in a spot that's only marginally +EV. Since it's your last hand of the year, you'll be taxed on this hand directly, so *now* is it -EV? The answer is still no, because if you lose the hand you'll get a discount on the loss. I suspect you forgot to factor that in. Thus, the tax effect is symmetric and all it does is reduce your EV by 20%, not flip it negative.

The only exception is if it's near the end of the year and you're so close to breakeven that the outcome of the hand will affect the sign of your profit for the year. *Then* the tax effect is asymmetric.",1661990481

 i have had a few friends over the past decades that needed to have a concrete saw guy come in.. 

 cut a rectangle out for both tower feet..  then cut a partial depth cut around 2 inches outside that...  so you can knock out the entire center rectangle...  then with that gone.. use a hammer to knock off the 2 inch wide partial cut..  you want it about half the full thickness of the existing slab.. 

 you will want to use a post hole shovel.. to dig a 3 to 4 foot pit under each tower mount area... a 10 inch to 14 inch connecting depth channel across.  from side to side... rebar.. 

 then you are going to get it filled with high strength mix.. 

 you will want to with the towers laid down.. take bolt patterns.. and transfer them to plywood..  so you can hang concrete anchor bolts with L shaped ends deep into the fresh pour... and have them line up perfectly..

 you will have either one or two 2x4s across to get the spacing and alignment perfect.. 

 you can get if you research... 60 and 94 pound bags of high strength concrete mix that is used to fix freeways and cures in  20 to 30 minutes..  so you have to be quick..  have 5 gallon buckets with the exact amount of water already filled.. to make it in your mixer.. to fill your excavation...

 why do it right... if it topples with you under the car.. you could be crushed.. and or your car be destroyed.",1661990482

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","What I meant was in practice giving police departments more money doesn‚Äôt seem to display crime reducing properties (sorry if it wasn‚Äôt/isn‚Äôt clear).  My hypothesis for why that might be true, if it is also true hiring more police officers does reduce crime, is that Police departments don‚Äôt spend it on more officers unless you force them to do so.  The two findings are, admittedly, difficult to reconcile so perhaps one of them is false (like maybe the control strategy for one of them is bad).

I guess I sort of assumed you were intending to suggest poverty reducing programs were sufficiently more efficient at reducing crime than police the poverty reducing programs are strictly dominant.  If you agree it probably varies which is better then, I think we mostly agree.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was in US Army basic training, there was another trainee soldier who won some sort of boxing award (Golden Gloves?). Our 1SG found out about it and teased him about it the whole time we were in training. In our last week, our drill sergeants gathered all the soldiers into the gym one day. The 1SG came and said that it‚Äôs totally against regulation, so we could never EVER say anything about it, but he wanted to fight the kid. He totally thought he could take him. The kid was super quiet and modest. I don‚Äôt think I ever actually heard him speak, but he was in a different platoon from me. 
So they fight. It lasted about a minute or less. The kid pinned 1SG. Like, bad. The whole gym absolutely erupted. 1SG was beet red in the face. He reminded us not to say anything and walked out. 
He wasn‚Äôt a bad leader or anything, but he‚Äôd spent the whole training cycle saying he could beat this kid. So it was definitely a humbling moment.",1661990482

&gt;**Amazon Product Rating**: 5.0 

&gt;**Fakespot Reviews Grade**: A

Symond might have explained how Lysene merchants were desperate to receive goods that had been made unaffordable by the Volantene occupation, and Wylde captains could make a pretty penny buying for cheap from the bloated Volantenes before smuggling goods to sell to Lysene traders. 

These Carons were prickly, though, and proud enough to consider justice more important than prosperity, unlike some more destitute lords and magisters Symond could name. Better to keep quiet on one's business practices than risk the wrath of the stags if some fellow lord were to report on him to Lord Cedric.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","&gt;[I'm from Malaysia btw. Prices are in Ringgit but universally most other things apply, more or less the same as the US]

&gt;I'm going to NZ on a working holiday visa. I have a manual 1.0 Perodua Bezza which I bought brand new at RM33.5k in 2018 which I use to drive Grab (local version of Uber). It has 2 years of instalments to be paid.

&gt;I was in the aviation industry, drove Grab (local version of Uber) part-time. Lost my job due to covid, drove it more or less full time among other things.

&gt;Carsome (local equivalent of cars.com) has offered RM24.1k but after some processing fees plus other ""fees"" to runners to convert it into a private use car it's probably about RM22k net.

&gt;Why do I want to sell the car? 1. No family members dare drive a manual transmission (the biggest factor...

&gt;Any advice on this?

fwiw, 15 months is a pretty long time for a vehicle to just be essentially sitting unused.

Plus, cars in general are just a major pain in the butt for all kinds of reasons and probably in most or all parts of the world.

 and when you do come back you might find that you want something totally different or that you don't need a car at all.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Fun fact, ""liberal"" ""progressive"" etc have very specific political meanings historically. Both involve white supremacy because pretty much all U.S. political History deals with white supremacy in some way.

Any way, both of those words meant very specific things for very specific movements. These days, though not *separate* , pretty much all Americans use both terms interchangeably and seem to mean ""farther left than regular democrats"", which is pretty funny tbh.

Malcom X would have been speaking about Liberalism in his time v.s. neo-liberalism we see today. Which, yep, definitely correct OP. Neo-liberalism is very capitalist in practice. BUT worth noting, while specific meaning to policy makers and analysts, u.s. public might ironically use ""liberal"" to describe ""less capitalist than regular democrats"" which is both very laughable paradoxal meanings, but also true.

so long as you dont attempt to pass it off as something it isnt, then it's a good thing to do and learn. unfortunately reddit has a lot of people that do stuff like this and rob people by selling it for $150 because the ones buying dont know any better. doing that is gross and always defended because people dont understand how scummy it is.

you would get insulted if you bought kfc chicken then tried to pass it off as your own original cooking because you reheated it in the oven. as long as you dont do that, it's a great start.

"LegendsOfRuneterra","t5_3a3ge","but it is not efficient or useful to keep fine tuning old cards that see no play just because a specific new card improved upon it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I love they balance old cards with little play to make them better. But it shouldn‚Äôt be done just because there‚Äôs a new slightly better card. 

You could even argue the new improved card is the balance to the old card: you wanted to play ‚ÄúRadiant Strike‚Äù but it needed some improvement? Well, not it has been improved and it is named ‚Äúcatch!‚Äù

I truly wish they were a bit bold and just removed one old card like this to set a precedent, so people calmed down. Like ‚Äútrue, Catch is better than Radiant Strike‚Ä¶ so we remove Radiant Strike you can use Catch from now on‚Äù or",1661990486

**General Tips**    
We generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar, splitting bottles with friends, attending festivals/tastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy.

"TarotDecks","t5_ib9q9","It depends on what your intentions for the deck are. As an accessibility feature I feel like this can be very helpful - vision impaired readers could probably use a screen reader to hear what the cards are, for example. It might be useful for beginner readers as well, but no more so than a beginner deck with keywords directly on the cards, like the Apprentice Tarot, and I generally recommend new readers to avoid relying exclusively on guidebook definitions anyway. It‚Äôs also a little gimmicky - the guidebook QR code seems like it would be just as easy to include on the box or on a single card included with the deck without detracting from the aesthetic of the cards, and looking up the card you want in the book isn‚Äôt so difficult that the QR code feels necessary on the individual cards as well. I wouldn‚Äôt buy a deck like this for myself at all - I rarely if ever use a guidebook so the QR codes would not be useful to me at all and ruin the artwork of the card for me, even if it‚Äôs just the backs. 

So basically it boils down to who your audience is for this deck. Do you want it to be an accessibility feature for people who are often excluded from tarot? The codes are a great idea and I think there‚Äôs definitely a need for them. Do you want it to be for beginners as a learning tool? It‚Äôs a little unnecessary, but as far as I know it hasn‚Äôt been done before, which is a good enough reason to go ahead with it. Do you want it to be appealing for collectors and advanced readers? Cohesive artwork and a unified aesthetic would be more important there than QR codes that are unlikely to see much use.",1661990486

But why the previous owner(s) gave him up... especially since Mira is so careful with giving dogs away and makes people really know the dogs, spend time with them and pick the right one, so it probably can't be that the owner returned him because he was walking too slow or too fast or not good in the city/countryside or anything like that...

Plus the process of getting dog is so complicated and it's such a big decision that I can't see a person changing their mind easily. For a moment I thought ""maybe the owner developed another health issue and couldn't take care of the dog anymore"", which was only plausible until she said that the reason why he was returned is something that doesn't bother her and she wouldn't return him for that reason.",1661990487

"Journalism","t5_2qhym","I think what has been most helpful for me is making connections with various local attorneys and former judges to turn to when I have questions about what is and is not important. A lot of what happens during trials are mere formalities. 

for example, an attorney making a motion to dismiss at the very end of the trial may seem like a big deal to a layperson---like WOW this obvious murderer is trying to get his case dismissed after all this evidence came out, and before the jury can deliberate that's crazy! But in reality, it's often just done for the purpose of allowing the defendant to maybe appeal the decision one day. 

or maybe a judge asks a witness to leave the room. that may seem weird to most people but again, its a normal part of the trial process to not have certain witnesses in the room at certain times--things like that (speaking from experience here)",1661990487

Solid odds, and more straightforward to play than the past couple days. We've got three strong arenas with nice safeties all around, plus we've got a good booster arena, so we'll just cover all the safeties once and boost with three lines.

30% to bust | 66% to profit/double | 34% to triple.

"golftips","t5_2re9x","If you're still accepting golf swing advice from an internet stranger...

1. Your hands are too high at address meaning that the angle from your forearms to the club shaft is too close to 180 degrees. Drop your hands a bit. That will close the angle slightly.
2. As you drop your hands, it'll cause you to adjust your spine angle. It will also cause you to stand a bit further from the ball (nothing crazy, maybe only half a ball length or less). It may also help you put your hips a tiny bit further out. Overall, it'll give you a more athletic position at address.

3a) As you stand further from the ball, your swing will be more likely to come from the inside to out instead of your current outside to in swing path (hard to tell from the camera angle, so maybe your swing path is neutral). Club face dictates initial direction. Swing path relative to club face dictates side spin.

OR

3b) Figure out a way to close the club face a bit more at impact (use stronger grip maybe?). It won't make the left to right shape disappear but it will tame how far right it goes. As you learn to close the club face more and more, you'll find at a certain point that your shot becomes dead straight or a straight pull left. What do you do from there is another thing entirely.

4) Make changes slooooooowly. Drill, drill, drill. Take video. Get professional instruction. Swing changes are hard and take time.

Best of luck and see you out there!",1661990487

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","I think one point of contention with the endings is just how much is left unexplained. If you're looking for a conclusive ending to the trilogy, the ending falls flat without a hell of a lot of headcanon, which is fine for some, but for others, they want an *actual* conclusion.

You pick synthesis - everyone is combined into a new AI/Organic hybrid. Ok, what does that actually mean?  You pick control - Shepard dies, but controls the Reapers. Same as above, what does that actually lead to? You pick destory - Reapers (and all AI) are gone. What about the billions left in a post-war galaxy? - There's just so much left unanswered.

The ending slides are very light on material, it provides a tease, but no full answer. You see your squadmates, you see London repaired, you see the Citadel repaired, but there's no detail as to how any of this happened or a time frame. Is it a year in the future or 100?

Edit: Actually I think it was the other way around. Sonya accused Dell of cheating but not with that particular woman. Dell hired a private investigator allegedly and found out Sonya was fcking his college buddy Steve Johnson, though Sonya claims it never happened before the divorce. Seems like Dell got together with Johnson's wife after the divorce, though it's possible it goes back further than that.",1661990489

They had a second girl 12 months later. Born on drugs. Went to foster care for the first 7 months before they got her back. I think they had her a month or two at most before she got taken away again. She went to the mom's mom who was already raising one of her kids.
So 4 kids between them and none were raised by the parents (except the oldest who had mom)

&gt; Iran&amp;#039;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, or IRGCN, attempted to capture a Saildrone unmanned surface vessel operated by the U.S. Navy&amp;#039;s 5th Fleet in the Arabian Gulf yesterday.

&gt; There are similar complications to the response side of the equation as well, as were tangentially exemplified when Iran shot down a Navy Global Hawk in 2019 and the United States struggled to decide on an appropriate reaction to such an attack on an aircraft that resulted in no human casualties or captured prisoners.

Maybe it's because you seem to fundamentally misunderstand what I'm saying, which is a request for something all players, whale or FTP, would benefit from (the opposite of herding cats): simple competence.

You say ""they made a mistake""... Yeah, which they do at least once a week. Typos and wrong dates in the blog are the norm, not a rare occurrence. It goes back to the poor management I mentioned.

For a company of this scale, with the revenue they generate, I do expect less of a clusterfuck. That's not a prima donna attitude, it's a base expectation. They wouldn't always have to rush out these instantaneous reactions and solutions if they could simply get their act together in the first place. It all goes back to poor management.

For a game that requires precision and dedication to max out the events they develop, it doesn't seem like too much to ask for a bit of the same on their end. But keep defending the billion dollar company that keeps messing up the basics.",1661990490

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","&gt;I said we the viewers know that Daemon loves Viserys, not least because his actor said so outright. But we see a lot of things that Otto doesn't.

And as I already said, Otto has been at the court since Daemon was a child more or less. So he very much knows he actually loves his brother. If he'd missed that, the man would be plain stupid, and Otto isn't stupid. So he knows. Which is why he wants him away. 

&gt;Yet people act as if Otto not wanting to coddle Daemon is the worst sin imaginable.

People recognize that Otto deliberately bashes Daemon for years and years because he knows he's the only one that would protect Viserys and actually put Viserys's interests first, because that's exactly what's happening. Otto is a vulture who will always put his personal prosperity first, above Viserys, above the Targaryens, and above the realm itself.

Again, why? You think all chemical engineers know everything? You don't think some (most?) of them are living in their own world not even knowing about a lot of stuff going around them?

I can contend that communalism has gotten worse in the past few years, but if media freedom is under attack, you wouldn't see so many domestically written websites attacking the government. Also remember how unbelievably large and diverse Indian society is. Adani also bought 49% of the stake in Quint, FYI. That didn't change a thing in how they report things. Apparently, the US really needs its domestic outrage machinery running and they just have to see dictators and tyrants everywhere. Be more grounded, precise and less emotional in your criticisms, Shekhar Gupta is a good example. Before you ask, no I don't think this is a 'conspiracy' against us. American state and cultural institutions are just caught up in their own culture war nonsense and a ton of confirmation bias wrt how they see things. They been doubling down on the narrative of a fascist nationalism pandemic threatening to destabilise the phony globalism they have peddled for decades. Whether it's Trump's election, Putin's intervention in Syria, Brexit, Modi, Ukraine, they have no room for nuance or context anymore. Every opinion has to be either black or white and nothing in between. It seems that life has come to a spot where everything turns into a confused cockfight of bull-headed proportions.

My gig in Japan is amazing.  It pays \~$60hr USD, and the employer pays 100% of our living expenses + a stipend for fun/food/etc.  They pay my mortgage on my condo there.  A condo which is amazing, and still cheaper than my studio's rent in B'ham.  Because B'ham.  No real worries while there on expenses, cost of living, healthcare provided by gov, etc.  My overall tax rate out of my pay some to around 16.5%.

While here in the States I make \~$25 at a warehouse.  I am literally the only person in the warehouse, so I do it all.  Picking, pulling, loading, unloading, C/S, tech help, delivery driver, billing/invoicing, and some customers get to be special snowflakes with entirely unique rules, because a salesman just haaaad to get the contract.  Its not like sales actually has to do real work or make it happen.  Tax rate, health coverage, 401k, etc eats around 23.8% of these paychecks.  Plus deductibles and out of pocket expenses, because shitsux.

Just going on my B'ham pay, if it is not enough to buy a house or condo, then it isnt a living wage, and it can fuck right off.  This is all amplified by the housing cost insanity in NA, Oceania, etc.  (No such crunch in JP since the 1950's)

Group Dreamcatcher has confirmed their comeback in October.

 According to Dream Catcher Company on the 1st, Dreamcatcher (Jiyu, Sua, Siyeon, Handong, Yoohyeon, Dami, Gahyeon) is currently preparing for a comeback in October.

Dreamcatcher's comeback is about 6 months after their 2nd regular album 'Apocalypse: Save us', which was released in April.¬†Through this seventh mini-album, they are expected to once again show the group's unique worldview as the second apocalypse series following the previous title, 'MAISON'.

'Apocalypse: Save us' was an album that marked the beginning of the 'Apocalypse' trilogy.¬†Music fans around the world are curious about what kind of concept and story Dreamcatcher will return to as a 'message restaurant' as it delivered a message about environmental protection with 'MAISON', including the aspiration to leap forward in a better direction in a dizzying world.

In particular, with their 2nd full-length album, Dreamcatcher took the first place in the iTunes Top Albums Chart in 20 regions starting from the US and the first in the iTunes K-Pop Album Chart in 8 regions. Not only did it set a corresponding record, but the Initial Chodong also broke more than 80,000 copies, achieving its own best record.

Dreamcatcher, who drove the momentum and won the first place in the first music show in 1924 days after debuting with 'MAISON', a valuable trophy.¬†Previously, through the world tour '2022 Dreamcatcher World Tour [Apocalypse: Save Us] in America', which was held in 8 cities in the United States and Mexico City, he set a steady career high with a ticket sales rate of 92% for all performances. Expectations are bound to be even higher.

Dreamcatcher, which debuted in 2017, has built a unique worldview that has never been seen in the music industry, such as the 'Nightmare' based on a fantasy story and the 'Dystopia' series with the theme of 'Anti-Utopia'.¬†With the rock metal genre at the forefront for the first time in a girl group, it has achieved step-by-step growth with sophisticated music and performances, and is showing potential as a singer-songwriter with the meaningful step of recording self-composed songs by all members, demonstrating a unique presence in the K-pop scene.

Dreamcatcher, which is spurring preparations to meet global fans, plans to open new album promotions sequentially through the official SNS channel.

Plot Summary:
Choke is a book about a man named Victor and his friend Denny. Victor grew up moving from one foster home to another because his mom was not able to take care of him. His mom would sometimes kidnap him from his foster parents, but they would always get caught and he would have to go back to the child welfare agency.
Victor is a con artist who tricks people into thinking he is choking so they will save his life and then he asks them for money.
Victor is a security guard at a museum where people act like it is colonial times. His best friend at work is Denny, who is always getting in trouble for having things from the wrong time period. They met at a support group for people who are addicted to sex. Denny gets fired and starts collecting stones to build his dream house.
Victor's mom taught him a lot of things that scared and confused him when he was younger. He also moved around a lot, so he couldn't form lasting relationships with women. This means he doesn't get sexual gratification. He starts talking to his mom again after not talking to her for years.",1661990493
"HomeNetworking","t5_2s4pd","I don't have promising news today, unfortunately.

Asus makes some cool stuff, but it is still consumer-grade, and most (if not all) lack support for 802.11q VLANs.  ;-(

A quick review of the ATX11000 router (from the rog.asus.com website) seems to confirm this.

Your Air Mesh router appears to be an RT-AX86U, which also lacks VLAN support.

VLANs are typically sourced and serviced by your primary router. VLAN traffic transits through managed network switches. Access points that need to handle more than one (V)LAN need to be VLAN-Aware.

Your best bet (with the equipment you have) is to move the items you need isolated onto your guest network, and call it good.

Otherwise, you'll need a pro-sumer wired router capable of handling your fiber speeds, such as an EdgeRouter ER3-Lite, or an EdgeRouter 4. (I'm assuming that your fiber is 1Gb. . .)

If you need multiple access point to handle both VLANs simultaneously, then you'd need to obtain VLAN-Aware access points, such as a TP-Link EAP650, Unifi 6 series, or similar.

While you could repurpose your existing routers, they aren't VLAN-aware. This would mean that one router would exclusively service your home network, and the other would handle your isolated network.  Both as access points only.",1661990493

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","There are games that do that like PGR (see: Babel Tower seasonal event). The difference is that PGR caters to a more dedicated playerbase than Genshin so they can feel free to add difficult bosses/ stage hp drain/ oneshot stunlock combos because the game has already set the precedent that there's a heavier emphasis on player skill. 


If you're going off PS achievement statistics, &lt;10% of the playerbase has bothered with Abyss and even less are capable of a 36* clear. That's hardly ""most of the playerbase"". Did you already forget the controversy Shadowy Husks caused when they appeared in the beta, not to mention the incessant whining about corrosion effects? You kinda just need to accept that this is the kind of game Genshin is. 


I also think enemies that just run away are annoying but your proposed alternative isn't much better. We already have enemies that just get up in your face like geovishaps and ruin graders and they're just HP meatballs most of us DPS through irrespective of their attacks. Scaling up enemy HP to take more than 2~3 rotations just turns it into a glorified DPS check, and implementing some non-damage check like the 2.6 Lector shields just invalidates gear investment.


There's certainly a demand for challenging content, but Genshin's dodge system is already really unresponsive and frankly something like high point difficulty Babel Tower in Genshin would be more frustrating than it would be fun.",1661990493

If you're keeping them sealed as an investment, just sell them now. Prices are insane and others will sell theirs to cash in on the high tide soon anyway. Plus the influx of repros and aftermarket systems will cut into values.

In the future, younger generations won't pay exorbitant prices for old tech and old fart millenials will be spending our money on healthcare, not games.

"mildlyinfuriating","t5_2ubgg","I don't feel gaslit one bit, you disagree with my definition of a term...as the article states, that's not gaslighting. üôÉ However the article actually agrees with my point so thank you for the link!

The example of the disagreement was over mask mandates, not about a specific event that did or did not occur/perception over what actually took place. OP was not getting bombarded for her views on a controversial topic, rather her perception of what happened directly to her on the flight. 

""Conflicts can veer into gaslighting if one person is (1) so insistent that the other person starts to doubt themselves. (2) A power imbalance in the relationship usually allows the gaslighter to undermine the gaslightee‚Äôs sense of self. (B) The need to control, the act of manipulating, and (3) the leveraging of power are essential components of gaslighting‚Äînot hurt feelings or challenged viewpoints""

1. People are going HARD on the point that her perception of guy being creepy/pushy was *her* paranoia and that he was simply existing next to her. Painting her as the bad guy, even though the ONLY witness is OP. Did this make OP doubt herself? That's for her to say, but the intention to change her perception is there. 

2. It's 100000% a dumb power imbalance, but there is actually a power imbalance here. It might not be as tangible as a parent, boss, older sibling, partner, etc...but when there is a large group of people not only telling her she's wrong but also downvoting her comments defending her perception, it's literally OP against hundreds/thousands of others.  Again it's dumb, but it's a power imbalance nonetheless. 

3. Swaths of people using their fake internet points to downvote OP *is* a leveraging of power. Still dumb, but here we are lol.

Bonus: I can't speak directly to the need to control or the act of manipulating because that's all about a person's intention and most gaslighters don't even realize their own intentions and I'm not about to try and guess what each individual person's reasoning for their comments. That being said, with mob mentality I wouldn't be shocked if at least a few of the many did have control and manipulation in mind. If not the intention of directing it specifically at the OP but to control and manipulate the narrative of her experience. Because, well...misogyny mostly but let's not open that can of worms. 

IMPO it isn't each individual person gaslighting her separately but rather the overall group of people doing it. One person comments insistently that they don't believe her, okay there's no power, control or manipulation (just an asshole) but you add them all up and it quickly becomes a legitimate case of gaslighting. 

I will address the ""it takes two to tango"" and ""relationship required"" bit just so you don't think I'm leaving it out but I just made another extended comment on that. [The TLDR of it was if someone slaps you in the face it doesn't matter if it's a stranger or a partner, it doesn't matter if it hurts/bruises or not... *it's still a slap in the face.* ] The effect of the gaslighting and intimacy level isn't all that relevant tbh. We don't know if OP did or did not internally doubt herself, depending on her own constitution it could go either way. Regardless of the effect, it was still gaslighting. Regardless of the intimacy level, it was still gaslighting...mass gaslighting is a thing and doesn't require a single 1-1 interaction with its victim/s. Like I said before, I don't see each individual as a gaslighter but the group itself.",1661990495

While the other legions were being brought up to combat strength, the 1st was clearing the Solar System of threats. It was upon their redeployment from these actions that they adopted the black armor. Also, they were the the emperor‚Äôs personal legion, and fought under his command during the conquest of earth. As for folks they would really hate: Horus, for the betrayal, and Peturabo, for lying. The Only Legion they really got on with was the Salamanders. Every body else ‚Ä¶. Well they didn‚Äôt much care either way. That being said, they were also the basis for all the other legions. Each host represented different styles of combat, and there were nine major ones.(pg87 HH bk IX) Even their big feud with the wolves was a personal beef between the primarchs at first.

Then there's the hypersonics program which is like throwing a Ferrari at a building (yes they could put nukes on them, but they haven't) and on top of that those hypersonics are all launched from jets...

They can be worth huge sums of money and still go bankrupt, if their cash flow cannot meet their obligations, it's game over. 

The question is, can bbby make significant enough changes moving forward to create positive enough cash flow to satisfy their obligations, and then, eventually to realize profits in beneficial ways.

The companies history and current market conditions make that a fairly risky bet 

But the play here wasn't ""buy the garbage distressed retailer who's lunch is being eaten by Amazon, and has been for years"" it was ""hope for a short squeeze"".

People going all in at a reasonable take profit point, then doubling down at the top because some Moran said ""it's for sure definitely absolutely going to without question go to 10, BAJILLION A SHARE probably maybe"" is insane.

- we tend to feel that our vote only matters to break up a minority government. And most of the policy/ politics is directed from Ontario and Quebec. Which tend to be much more liberal.
- we are annoyed that the revenue from natural resources we bring to the table is being under valued, and frustrated that any attempt at expanding markets is actively been subverted.
- dissatisfied with the idea that a subversive separatist party has the influence it does.
- bothered by the fact that electoral reforms that can be done to improve regional representation keep getting promised and side lined.

"AzurLane","t5_4tiyvo","So I over-estimated how far back the problem goes.

Since the end of June, we've only had 1 week of break. That's two months with only 1 week of break. Two cube-eating mini events (Angel of the Iris and Operation Convergence), a full blown ""light"" rerun with a UR (Dreamwaker's Butterfly), a major event (Aquilifer's Ballade), a week of rerun characters before adding to permanent pool (Ashen Simulacrum), and Wishing Well. That's **4 events** and a rate up (one event including a UR) in 9 weeks. 8 out of 9 weeks of having something justifiably worth spending cubes on.

600 cubes is not plenty, especially for that pace of events. I was down to about 350 even with the Commission Exchange Plan. The only reason I'm above 400 now going into the next event (which is expected to have a UR) is because I skipped the Ashen characters, Wishing Well, and pretty much skipped this event. I literally couldn't keep up. It didn't help that my luck was bad on all 3 events I did participate in.

For comparison, I started at the end of last October. November had 2 weeks of break, and December had a full *3 weeks* going into Tower of Transcendence for Ulrich. January had 2 weeks, February had 1 week, and March and April had 2 weeks, and May had 1 week, and June had 2 weeks. July had none, and August had only 1.

Just for clarity, when I say ""break,"" I mean any event where you can get everything without spending any cubes.

I wouldnt count it against a father who was a surgen that saves lives daily to run into a house fire against the advice of others trusting that God was with him even in failure to possibly save his child eho he loves and also hopes in him for safety and protection.

*****
&gt; &amp;quot;Employment reasons accounted for 45 per cent of all first residence permits issued in 2021, with 1.3 million permits. This represents an increase of 47 per cent compared with 2020. It is also the highest number of permits issued for employment reasons since the beginning of the time series,&amp;quot; the office says.

&gt; In spite of having issued 88 per cent fewer first residence permits for employment purposes compared to Poland, Spain is the second country with the largest number of such permits issued in 2021.

&gt; The Czech Republic, on the other hand, issued another 41,592 first permits of residence for foreign workers in 2019, which is higher than the 29,217 permits issued in 2020 but quite lower than the 66,440 permits issued in 2019.

"F1Manager","t5_392r0","That's not hot. For example, the 'Hot Spot' temp on a 3090 (VRAM in its case) will hit 110C before it starts to throttle. And the 1080 TI's normal core operating temp is 84C. On the CPU side of the house, Intel uses 100C as their threshold.

That's not to say that you want to be throttling (or that cooler isn't better!), but just that, unless your GPU manufacturer says otherwise, 78C is likely nothing to be even remotely concerned with. 80C is the popular gamer 'Too Hot' threshold when building cases and setting up profiles, but it's not a hard rule. It's just an easy number to remember that errs on the side of caution. And is also incredibly old and outdated.

But, it's still safe and doesn't hurt anything so it lives on.

---

And all of that is why *core usage* rather than temps is what people look to when talking about how hard a game is hitting their PC. Granted usage and temps usually go hand in hand, but not always. The 1080 that I mentioned before actually *tries* to hit that 84C mark when under any sort of load. It will keep the fans low until it hits that temp and then ramps up to maintain it alongside a high core freq. So, someone saying that their 1080 is running at 84C is telling you absolutely nothing. It could be running at 100% load or 60%.

---

If you are curious to see what sort of temps you should be expecting from your card then check the manual. Don't take the word of random gamers online (myself included), go to the manufacturer.

Once you have that number it couldn't hurt to download a benchmark/stress test to see how well your card handles running all out.",1661990500

Those are pretty much non negotiable unless you‚Äôre just better than me at this Hahha. I‚Äôm sure you can but I‚Äôm not the best at it. I‚Äôm happy for getting my car at no markup besides sticker price. I wasn‚Äôt happy with the APR but the times suck. I eventually went to a credit union and got 2.90 %.

It's not a game that rewards short term play, with many goals being multi-month or multi-year endeavours, and it's an odd mix of being boring as shit 95% of the time mixed with being an absolute rush that will give you the shakes the other 5% of the time. 

Best enjoyed both with a group on comms as well as when you have a long term goal set for yourself (regardless of what that goal is), it's not a game I'd suggest to try and play solo or in short bursts.

Alpha clone is f2p and effectively an almost unlimited time free trial, you lose nothing by giving it a download and checking it out. Having a referal code when you create your character gets you a million free skill points (about 2-4 weeks of training time) and is a very nice boost to get quite a few of your fundamental skills up to par quickly.

Then they say something the audience didn't care for and they're hit with the harsh reality that fame is fleeting and the audience becomes disolutioned with the harsh reality of their hero.

Now we have a Tolkien sized book about a bunch of peoples' hurt feelings and this is the new face of society. There will be more of this dumb shit I assure you.

He uses a lot of dark and lightening magic, and you have to aim for his head.

When you‚Äôre fighting him, you may want to take off the headband and wear the Beryl Circlet. It‚Äôs cheese tho, cause it absorbs lightning.. basically making him too easy. But if you want to go after him, I‚Äôd at least recommend picking up a Crissaegrim or two to wield .

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","The gap in women's favor before 30, might be 35, is 8% last time I saw.  Ironically, this is when women go part time or take time off due to having a child.  

So women are making more at the start, men at the back half, but the gap flips. I would assume because of the women who become mothers who still work taking a little more flexible job to be with the child more.  Liek if you are a nurse, that seems like a really shitty job to balance child care with.  Big shifts you can't leave.  So you stop being a nurse and then instead work for a dentist or some entry level office job you can get some flexibility with.  So you might go from 80k to 45k.  Every woman who does this would impact that number, and it wouldn't take terribly many since we are looking at the median anyway.  I mean, there is a reason the numbers switch and a mother taking a more flexible job for less pay than before the child seems like a pretty reasonable thing to do.

"kpopthoughts","t5_2730wn","Honestly girl groups are more appealing to the US, especially a group like BP. They have looks that appeal to the west, only have 4 members, 3/4 fluent in English and two grew up in the west so they know the culture already, they use a lot of English in their songs, and have the appeal of being influencer/instagram models. Girls want to be them, and guys think they're attractive. If anything, I'm surprised they haven't broken through yet. They've had so many opportunities and are 6 years into their career. 

Boy groups traditionally attract the teen girl demographic the most and get mocked by almost everyone else. The amount of slurs I've seen against BTS is disgusting. But I think that's why BTS's success is even more amazing. They've broken through the teen girl stereotype and appeal to multi generations. Their US concerts seemed to be mostly 20-30 somethings, with a good mix of even older!

I agree with you that people underestimate BTS's success in the US and overestimate BP's. BP are the second most popular group, but the gap between them is huge. Look at their music streaming numbers, concert demand, sales, and Billboard. The amount of times I hear BTS mentioned (or their music played) is honestly so weird to me as a longtime kpop fan. I never thought a group would break out of the niche like they did in the US. I remember a few years back my workplace (a rather important US institution) was even hoping Bts might visit so we brag about it. I was not a fan then, but even I thought it was amazing a kpop was being discussed like that.

BTS still faces a lot of racism and toxic masculinity though. Many Americans still love to mock men for wearing makeup, dressing ""feminine"", being close to each other, etc. Even Howard Stern (üôÑ) had to come to their defense when his coworker blamed them for covid. But I think BTS is having the last laugh as they are pretty much the most in demand act in the world right now.

But I think kpop will continue here for years. I don't know if any group though will capture the same multi-generational, passionate fanbase that they have. Sure, they have lots of casual fans, but they also have fans that don't just love the music or the members, but love their lyrics, their message, and the friends they've made through the group. It's really a phenomenon.",1661990503
"crashbandicoot","t5_2tgip","Ehh, they did that with the Tropies in that game, and it came off as out of place.

I think the gist of most villains in the old games is they took themselves seriously, but in defiance of being flawed quirky butt monkeys. They were funny but because they had some dignity to lose in the first place.

In Crash 4, they just do 'dumb guy' jokes with Crash and the lowlier villains, and everyone else is not funny or flawed at all. It's basically a serious story with comic relief. That's why the tone has a ""Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars"" feel, rather than the sincere and ambient, but still silly and whimsical tone of the originals.",1661990503

The 30% upgrade discount through Sonos from the 5 swung it for me and I ordered a Sub and temporarily split a pair of Play 1s to fill in for the now decommissioned 5 and Connect while I figure that bit out. The system is updated to S2: ready for the sub to arrive tomorrow!

Overall impressions are S2 is more polished, a few more features and a couple of nice extras, like naming groups of speakers to quickly group some together, like 'ground floor'. Volume has numbers against the sliders. WiFi setup of new components is easier. The app looks cleaner and album art is better. I'm not sure S1 supported my Nas but I was happy to see I could now resetup my library in my Nas that runs SMB2 (the Nas connection didn't work for a while as S1 used to require insecure SMB1).

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","My worldbuilding project is essentially an amalgamation of Ainu, Japanese Shint≈ç, and various Buddhist understandings of the afterlife set in a Chinese/Japanese/Korean inspired warring states period.

In Shint≈ç, the bodies of the deceased are wrapped in a pure white cloth. Hence the white part.

In Japanese Buddhism, there is a ""dark path"" called Meid≈ç which is a surprisingly detailed account of various moral trails along a roadway during which the deceased is judged by seven kings. These kings are various Buddhist deities but given Japanese imperial names like King Shok≈ç for Shaka Ny≈çrai (aka. Gautama Buddha). At the end of Meid≈ç there is our world, Tamagahara (heaven) and Jigoku (hell). In Jigoku, the deceased is tormented in various ways in 16 main hells and as many as 64,000 minor hells as they are judged by six more kings before they are reborn. 

Fun fact, you can be reborn as a god in heaven in some buddhist sects. Though, obviously, the point is to reach nirvana and escape samsara altogether. But who said you couldn't get a cushy job as a god in the meantime?

So after all that context, the wanderers in white are deceased souls traveling between the various trials along the Meid≈ç road. Messing with one of these souls could mean messing with someone who will be reborn as a monsterous Oni or some other yokai.",1661990504

I think the truth is that we are good, even great, at hardware. But Swedes in general, even soldiers are not prepared for war - ABSOLUTETLY not, we just don't know how to handle evil.

Correct, although if I notice they're likely to end up having to make a major change in their acceleration to find a spot to merge, especially since some on-ramps have limited visibility, I will first check if I can change lanes without disrupting traffic in the other lane, or second try to determine if either speeding up or slowing down slightly will help them.

Good thing for Reg, who else would carry everyone else through the Abyss. And of course it turns a bit weird.

It's pretty wild how big the village is now compared to when it first was created.

Big eyeball hollow clearly remembers Vueko.

To be fair that piece of clothing was clearly working as a hood. Hopefully it isn't used. And that it isn't a hollow that finds value in being underwear.

150 years, interesting. Something like a 13 to 1 ratio assuming the cult entered the Abyss roughly two thousand years ago?

Don't use one of the Cradles of Desire, Riko, it's a *terrible* idea.

Oh great, giant aggressive hollow is a replicant child abuser. Maybe Reg will just simply kill it.

Oooo, form change.

Surely it's whistle time, right? Or maybe incinerator time?

Hopefully nothing horrible happens in the next two hours!

Or maybe everything is about to go pear shaped even before Reg has time to go unconscious. Ten minutes is clearly enough time for plenty of horrible things to occur.

Fully healed Faputa will be able to eradicate everyone even more efficiently.

Moderately confused by that ending scene. How did they get outside the village? Timeskip past Faputa destroying everyone plus the village?",1661990505

Let‚Äôs make the math really easy. You have a house that‚Äôs been in your family forever. Adjusted for inflation, the initial purchase price is a three hundred thousand dollars. Rents have flown up in your area, and it rents for one hundred thousand dollars a year (rents on townhouses get this high in HCOL cities).

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","Arabs, semites, kazakhs, and punjabs aren't pale, but it's probably more of the face shape and some historical pseudoscience. I think the theory was (when we were making the categories) that they were all descended from Indo-Europeans, while Sub-Saharan Africans and east and southeast Asians weren't (based on the old classifications of Caucusoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid, with tall, flat and long faces and akuls respectively)

Specifically, they were:

- Armenoid

- Mediterranean

- Hamitic

- Iranid (covering up to Afghanistan)

- Nordic (anything from Great Britain, Denmark, Germany, or Scandinavia) 

- Alpine (Tajikistan to Kazakhstan)

- Aryan (mixture of different Caucusoid subtypes)

- Iberian

- Slavic

This (and I'm making it clear for the mods, *very outdated an unscientific*, and simply discussing this in a historical context as a possible explanation to answer why the current status quo is the way that it is) system can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race). Of course, this was a wishy washy system to begin with, but it wasn't skin color itself that determined what you wrote down, but what you looked like overall (think back to skull measurements). 

The census system has always been a bit weird, without much will to change it outside of some specific cases. Latinos used to just be white, before latino was split off as an ethnicity and they were asked to identify as white, native American, or mixed

Plus, it doesnt look like kazakhs even think of themselves as Asian, as seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kazakhstan/comments/ncodnm/why_arent_kazakhs_and_other_central_asians/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) where someone asked kazakhs why they weren't Asian on the US census. The census used to explicitly list ""Caucasian"" as the option (even just in my lifetime), but ""white"" is just a more common phrase that is close enough for most people

If we want to be really technical, the census doesn't think Central Asians, Persians, or Arabs exist (neither White nor Asian cover the area). Greeks and Syrians used to not be white. It's weird. And, of course, it's self-reported and unenforced, so if you want to be the Hispanic Pacific Islander Sven Jorgensson, you can",1661990505

There have been class action suits, major investigations. Lots of things looking into this, at least in the UK.

You shouldn't be in pain and there's a real chance your Dr is just saying it's normal because that's what their teacher said. Even if it's been proven wrong.

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","NVDA absolutely finessed me this past week. I had bought Sep 16th $160 puts the day before earnings.  Earnings was the worst I‚Äôve ever seen, but stock price only went down 5% in after hours, and started to pump back up and opened up only 1% down, and then continued to pump to 5% green the rest of the day.  I took a 30% loss on my Puts to try and salvage at least some of the money, figuring there was no way it would drop after that ridiculousness.  

Fast forward to today - NVDA puts would‚Äôve been worth 300% of what I paid, and that was before the stock dropped another 5% in after hours today.  Those puts probably will be worth 500% tomorrow morning, and I sold them for a 30% loss. Faaaaack my paper hands",1661990507

If you can, try save 10-20% of every pay check for yourself no matter what. Then debt (20-30%) and living expenses (the rest). As your debt begins to go down, your savings also go up. The result will be that once your debt is cleared, you won‚Äôt be at $0 net, but whatever your savings are. It‚Äôs psychologically altering and gets you out of the slave mentality.

Once the Habit starts to do it's thing I'll revisit what's happening on the Blooper.  Time and stutter effects work really well, as does messing with stability and adding and removing layers (particularly bouncing the layers knob).  I'll also mess with the Habit's settings to make some fun noises; since the main riff thing is still looping it all sounds coherent.  When I'm done I'll either use the fadeout stopper setting on Blooper first then use trails on habit to fade it out or vice versa works well too.  I also often put my Mood at the end of the chain because it's delay is so rhythmic and it has that cool ambient tape+reverb setting.

This progress and the energy/fear  surrounding abortion laws had me hopeful for a close race, with possibility of both chambers being dem controlled. Had me excited about more possibilities. 

Then he started speaking about gun control, and not just control, but BANNING assault rifles.  (Personally, my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter, and not at all the point ) I‚Äôm not certain of the specifics of his plan, but in truth it doesn‚Äôt matter. This will be the rally call the right has been waiting for for many years. I think the rage and energy they will put into that topic will overshadow everything. I feel that this political move will pretty much guarantee hardcore R turnout in a heavily gerrymandered country, and have both chambers turn red.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Capitalism is the term marx used for liberal and facsist economies. Capitalism has several componates; class devides due to labourors and owners, capital accumulation due to poorly calculated cash flow, and permanent or constant inflation. 

Socialism means workers owning the MOP and therefore distributing gains and product between each other, wether by free market( mutualism, syndicalism), or by planned market (communism, red facism, democratic socialism) economies.

There are issues with both, but its the contradictions and systemic lies that make me anti capitalist. Socialism is a system that, if done properly, can be self sufficient wich is good. If done poorly it can be as devastating as capitalism. So if capitalism is the bar, the socialism by far surpasses. By emplementing just small parts of socialism in countries like scandinavia, germany, and france we can see increases in quality of life, increased power of the idividual, and a closing of the wealth gap. The only issue is that because we are globally still in a capitalist society, there is no worldwide change, and there is not so much improvement in conditions that would allow people to self manage their work.",1661990509

100% agree that Alice could have handled this better. For what it‚Äôs worth, despite Fern being a bit wobbly with walking, he seems to be able to have the dexterity to handle himself. I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing or hearing about him getting hurt much. Fall is always a risk, but I‚Äôm always surprised at how capable the little ones are.

Yes, I am the second of three wives. üòÇ
Just like I wasn't the only girlfriend in my first relationship. I was the third girlfriend, and all of us were Pagan. We would all spend time together as well. I have also been in relationships where my partner had only me. I have been in a monogamous marriage before as well. All of this before Islam. I prefer to be in a polygynous relationship. It just comes natural. 
My Athiest mother was a girlfriend to a married man and she was living in their home. He had another girlfriend as well. Everyone knew and everyone consented. 
I have known women who have more than one man and men who had more than one woman. They vary between being Christian, Atheist, and Pagan, and even one person who is Muslim.

I think it's perfect for adaptation for exactly this reason. It's natural a creative person would want to flex their own muscle on a project. But this is usually what leads to adaptations changing things and pissing off fans. Fire &amp; Blood is written in such a way that it provides a framework of overarching events for the showrunners to follow, while still leaving them enough room to write their own scenes and be creative.

I essentially just listen to an occasionally echo what I see in the data and what other analysts say. This messaging is typically not consistent with the idea of 2008 style crash where median home values nationwide will tank 30+%. I definitely agree we're in for a correction and can see prices decline, but not nearly to that effect for national median houses.

This is an RE Bubble sub not an RE Crash sub. But it seems like most of the memes on here perpetuate the idea that we're suppose to see a massive crash. Maybe we will. But until the data reflects that, I'll just keep pointing out the unpopular reasons why that is unlikely.

just saying that your horrible experience with one form probably won‚Äôt happen with others. there are so many forms of birth control nowadays

even so, if you still don‚Äôt want it, neither of you can force each other to do something that the other doesn‚Äôt wanna do. if you don‚Äôt want to be on birth control, you don‚Äôt have to. if he doesn‚Äôt wanna have sex without you being on birth control, he doesn‚Äôt have to. both of your comments towards each other were uncalled for. imo you both have some maturing to do before you should consider this a ‚Äúserious‚Äù relationship",1661990514

"fuckcars","t5_3cs2l","It‚Äôs not just because cities have failed to be build housing. That‚Äôs a big part of it. 

But also huge is a lack of federal and state support. Most tax breaks and subsidies go towards home owners. The real, true cost of owning a home in the suburbs is more than most anyone can afford. So the government heavily subsidizes suburban development and entices homeownership with all kinds of tax breaks, credits, and write offs: First time home buyer credits, number of kids/dependents, property tax, mortgage interest, mortgage insurance, capital gains advantages, etc. 

This kind of assistance simply doesn‚Äôt exist for renters. Despite their considerably lower burden on city‚Äôs expenses. I know that renters have some types of assistance, but it‚Äôs nothing like what homeowners gets. 

There‚Äôs no reason why an 800sqft apartment in Los Angeles or New York City should cost the same or even more than the mortgage on a 2500sqft home that has 4+ bedrooms and 3+ bedrooms on 1/2+ acre plot of land. In no universe should that be cheaper than renting.",1661990515

"ManyBaggers","t5_hwj28","I have the Raven 20L and I believe they're structured the same so hopefully these help.

I took mine on a work trip recently too. I carried similar stuff as you: laptop, tech pouch (aka a toiletry bag that I used as a tech bag), other essentials. The extra space of a 28L sounds like it'd be enough for your needs. I like the amount of pockets but wasn't able to maximize it since I had a pouch to hold all the tech stuff but since you mention you need a ton of pockets, then it should be alright (I believe the 20L and the 28L have the same pocket layout).

A few things to note:

* when you put the bag down, it will lean forward and probably tip over
* some people find the strap a bit scratchy (I don't)
* The water bottle pocket isn't elasticated or particularly tight. I had a Klean Kanteen in mine and it was fine. My travel tumblr (16oz) also fit.
* When you do put a water bottle in, it will subtract from the space inside the main bag space, if that makes sense.

It was comfortable walking to work, traveling and just usual daily stuff. I found the top pocket very convenient. If you've got 15in laptop in the compartment, the top pocket will sit right on top of it so just be aware of what you put in there as it'd be resting on top of your laptop. I had my phone, metro card, keys in the top pocket and it wasn't banging on my laptop or anything.",1661990515

"MomForAMinute","t5_3g7sw","Also a sister, and can confirm, isopropyl alcohol works wonders for nausea, especially when it comes on suddenly. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend sniffing it straight out of the bottle, but putting it on a paper towel or piece of gauze would work! 

I deal with chronic nausea due to medical issues + a narcolepsy medication side effect, so I‚Äôve collected a lot of tools for managing nausea. I usually start with a ginger chew, or go straight to zofran if it‚Äôs bad. If the ginger chew doesn‚Äôt work, then I take a zofran tablet. Oral Zofran does take 30 minutes to an hour to kick in, so I‚Äôll often use my other tools to manage it in the meantime. These include ginger chews, ginger ale, isopropyl alcohol, cool wash cloths, and using a fan to blow
cool air on my face.

Also, this will sound weird, but if you are having issues with throwing up, add some salt (and potassium salt, ideally) to your ginger ale for a homemade anti-nausea electrolyte drink! I also add magnesium powder to mine. The sugar and ginger flavor covers up the salty taste, and you‚Äôll feel a lot better if you‚Äôre keeping those electrolytes in balance!

Ideally, you want to try not to throw up within the first 30 minutes after taking zofran, but if you do, you can take another one (depending on your doctor‚Äôs recommendations for you).

Slightly off-topic, but due to my propensity for nausea and vomiting, my anesthesiologist and surgeon decided to put me on a scopolamine patch before my septoplasty/turbinate reduction surgery, and it completely controlled my nausea for 3 days!

Character: Andreya Malcerius, Blade Dancer Pirate  
Andreya Malcerius was born into Raotian nobility and quickly  
realized she couldn't stand it. At sixteen, she stowed away on a ship to escape  
it all, ending up in the lawless city of Unconfito. There, a brothel owner took  
her in, not as a working girl but as security. After a year and a half, she  
began to feel the ocean's call and signed about the Ruin Wings, a feared pirate  
crew.   
For a year and a half, Andreya sailed with them. Then, her  
captain was contacted by Safron Mal, a Judge of Wyn, with a plea for aide in a  
siege that could decide the fate of the entire world. They sailed for the Old  
Continent, and there, on the field of battle, Andreya and her entire crew were  
slain, Andreya falling to a Meteor Swarm. Now, fifty years after the end of the  
siege, someone resurrected her and bound her soul to another. Andreya is  
currently trying to unravel it all and get used to her second life.

2,4-D would be my biggest concern. It is a very powerful herbicide that I really only use when needed and in spot-spraying applications (not broadcast spraying). I‚Äôll let you do your own research in to 2,4-D and how it can affect humans or pets that come in contact with it.",1661990515

They seem to be very concerned with overwhelming the mental health providers in Korea and have squashed a ton of PCSs for people who have sought treatment in the recent past/are still undergoing treatment, even if the issues do not appear to be particularly severe.   Also Camp Walker isn't an AF insulation and they may suppose that will cause additional stress on you and/or the system.  I am aware of someone who got it canceled the same week they were supposed to leave, so orders in hand and everything.  I know some places have tried to wait until that hurdle is cleared before getting the orders finalized, but it be like that sometimes. 

If it is canceled and if you are a mandatory mover then you will get another assignment, if you are not, then you will likely just stay put.  I spoke with someone who was a retired Chief who used to be at a unit in Korea, and he said that in some cases if the inbound unit knew the individual and they had a dialog going, then the Chief and Commander could chime in with the medical folks saying they think the member would be good to come, but that was also with a small community where everyone knew everyone else, and it had to do with the command team building relationships with the medical staff.

"oklahoma","t5_2qtnt","I respect your dedication to your beliefs. I also see a small problem with that logic.

Suppose that you're a charismatic person, and that you convince the majority of the local population that a minority are all guilty of a serious crime. You and some friends run for the offices of Judge in the region, and sweep the ticket on a campaign of sentencing those evil people to prison for as long as you can put them there. 

You then get the local police to arrest them based on that belief, and you sentence them to prison. In addition, whenever someone brings a suit against that minority, you rule that they are liable. When they appeal on the basis that you had insufficient evidence to convict, they run into another member of your coalition and it goes about as you would expect.

The result of this is that a Majority can strip the Minority of all their property, and that they can be forced to do labor in a prison or starve to death.

Does your proposed system have *any safeguards in place* to ensure the rights of minorities cannot be crushed by a majority?",1661990516

You might skip Character Stories and hangouts, but you will most likely try to get as many primogems as you can to get characters and try teams you don't have on your main acc. Game will be stealing more of your time than you would like to admit. And then there is need for Crystalflies and Character materials... really? some extra hours farming stuff, leveling characters, going through artifact hell again all from the start?...

&gt; Recently, a new covert class of user has been employed to sway opinion in social media, &amp;quot;Shills.&amp;quot; The general term &amp;quot;Shill&amp;quot; denotes an enthusiastic accomplice.

&gt; 2 Collecting Data to Study Shills The data we collect pertaining to shill accounts comes from Reddit, where we crawled and labeled users posting in a politically-active forum on the site.

&gt; 4 Identifying Shills We apply the data and feature extraction approach to build a classifier that can differentiate shills.

He did, maybe, up until noon on January 20, 2021.

&gt; If DOJ wanted them so bad why wait until right before midterms to come and get them?

Did you miss the part where the documents were requested months ago and Trumps team sent back some documents they weren't supposed to have anymore? Then, supposedly an informant from Mar-a-Lago confirmed that Trump still had documents there (this occurred sometime between June 3rd and July 31st 2022. 

So at longest the FBI knew about the additional documents for somewhere between 8 - 66 days before the warrant was executed. We also know they didn't get the search warrant until August 5th 2022.

So the FBI only waited 3 days from when they got the search warrant signed to execute it August 8th.

This timeline seems reasonable once you account for the FBI having to plan a raid of a large structure like Mar-a-Lago.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

The average Nuclear Reactor is 40 years old.

All reactors made in the US had an initial design life of 25 years.

In the history of the US, only 23 reactors have ever been shut down (at 19 locations).  The US has currently 93 operational reactors at 55 plants which produce 20% of the United States Nuclear power (down from around 40% in 1986 as demand increased and few new reactors were built).

To add another perspective, it only took 18 years to build enough power plants to produce about 40% of the US Nuclear power.  From 1970 to 1986 and the power production by Nuclear has been flat since then.  If we continued at the 1970's rate we would have had 100% of our power produced by Nuclear by Y2K.",1661990518

&gt; Recently, a new covert class of user has been employed to sway opinion in social media, &amp;quot;Shills.&amp;quot; The general term &amp;quot;Shill&amp;quot; denotes an enthusiastic accomplice.

&gt; 2 Collecting Data to Study Shills The data we collect pertaining to shill accounts comes from Reddit, where we crawled and labeled users posting in a politically-active forum on the site.

&gt; 4 Identifying Shills We apply the data and feature extraction approach to build a classifier that can differentiate shills.

"Mommit","t5_2s3i3","In Canada they post the job for a 1 year contract.  It is actually way easier to attract people to work a full 1 year guaranteed contract than 8 weeks.  Plus many people get their foot in the door and make a first impression during these mat leaves.  It's hard in 8 weeks to get the full feel for a new employee, but over a whole year people get a chance to really shine and get good at what they do.

I got into my current position by filling a years mat leave, several of my coworkers did the same to get their jobs.  When I did it, they saw I was a good employee, I got paid full wages for a year, went on my own mat leave (paid for by the government and not my employer so no skin off their teeth) and by the time my mat leave was wrapping up they called to say an employee was moving and would I like his job, since they loved my work during the mat leave.  I said yes and came back to a permanent job. This mat leave they have already posted my job and I have met one of the new hires, and she is enthusiastically encouraging me to take the 18 month contract so she can get an even longer contract haha. Honestly we are so busy and so many new jobs are being created, 2 or 3 coworkers are approaching retirement age, people move and go on mat leaves all the time, and my job is heavily unionized so they cannot fire me, I don't feel threatened and hope when I come back I see her working there permanently as well!  After all that's how I got my job!

Bottom line, a longer leave actually helps the new hire become much more competent, the employer gets a new person they trust to add to the casual, temp or whatever pool, and the nature of people retiring, moving, deciding to step down to part time hours, getting sick, etc. means people only need to do the contract work for a few years before they get something permanent.  And in many government jobs, you become an ""internal candidate"" so they have to consider you first for any new job postings before even looking at external candidates.",1661990521

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","To be honest, your age diference with your boyfriend is completely natural in my opinion. It is the same age difference my father has with my mother, albeit she was older than you when they started dating, she was 29 my father was 41. It truly depends on the maturity you may both have (I have met people in their 50s who are teenage like and people in their 20s who are unfathomably mature). 

Maturity is not the same for everyone, and each individual matures (or doesn't in some cases) at a different speed and in different ways. What you described isn't creepy or strange in my opinion, and I suggest you take most comments (including mine of course) with many grains of salt. Certain parts of reddit are filled with people who may be hurt, and may want consciously or unconsciously to spread more hurt, cause mysery loves company, you know. 

It depends on what you want and are happy with in a relationship. There are many kinds of relationships and few are ""wrong"", the ones with one of the partners being a minor and the deeply abusive ones. That said, if you have doubts about your relationship talk with a counselor ot therapist. He or she may be able to help you more than we do, especially if they meet your boyfriend.",1661990522

"AskConservatives","t5_2yb8u","The problem with the right/left divide is no one knows what's right and what's left.  So I can't say who is ""Far Left"" or ""Far Right""   


Politics is about socioeconomic philosophies. Meaning the Social Scale and the Economic Scale of how a government should be organized.  


On the Social Scale, you have far left ideologies of the pure libertarian view that everyone is free to do whatever they wish as long as they don't infringe on another. Love who you want to love, worship how you want to worship, consume what you want to consume. The individual decides what is right for them. On the far right, you have authoritarianism where a superior authority decides what is right for the people.   


On the economic scale you have communism (on the far left) and laissez-faire capitalism on the far right. Economics is really the study of scarcity. How do you allocate scarce resources in balance with unlimited wants. The 3 pillars of economics in a society are labor, land and capital or rather property (including intellectual) to create a good or service. Under communism, there is no private property. All property is collectively owned. Under capitalism, it's your property you do with it as you please.

When we summarize a socioeconomic philosophy as a governing body, our range goes from anarchy to totalitarian. Meaning, no government to control the socioeconomic order vs. total control by the government. Anarchy to the Left. Totalitarianism to the right.

&amp;#x200B;

In American politics we are schooled in the philosophies of our founding, defined in our declaration that ""All men are created equal"", By this declaration, and those that adhere to it, all Americans are left on the social order (or liberal). The question become how far left.    


In American politics, most believe in private property and are therefore on the right side of that scale.  


The last scale is the role of government. This is the divide in the USA. Unfortunately, the scale we have is the inverse. Small Government (which should be left) is right and Big Government is left.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions to define right and left in the USA are:

1. Should the government decide what people should do? Yes = Right, No =Left
2. Should the government control private property? Yes = Left, No = Right
3. Should the government ...  (in general?) Yes = Left, No = Right

&amp;#x200B;

So, coming back to the original question after defining terms: ""Who's the most right wing congressman?""  

Most far left is Bernie Sanders. The most far right is Rand Paul.  


But note, we are not talking about they same things when we say ""far-whatever"" it's more commonly used as a pejorative to label someone ""extreme""",1661990523

Coastal vessels stay in their little shallow water caps, never coming out for fear of getting popped by a thousand kilos of explosive, while bluewater never enters for fear of getting jumped and torpedoed.

I don‚Äôt know how this can be corrected though, because realistically that is exactly how the PT-bluewater dynamic works irl - it‚Äôs kind of difficult to fix that without taking some real creative liberties with reality",1661990523

"VaushV","t5_10to4u","If I have the timeline correct, the JRE episode with Milo happened on October 1, 2015. Milo talks to Joe about the sexual abusive he experience as a child, while insisting that it was not abuse.

On January 5, 2016, the Drunken Peasants have Milo on. They watch some video that brings up clips from the JRE episode, and Milo goes into more detail, leaving some damning statements behind. He basically frames the child abuse as this ""coming of age relationship"" and says other revolting stuff.

Finally, on February 20, 2017, clips from that Drunken Peasants podcast episode resurface. Milo resigns from Breitbart News and CPAC rescinds his invitation. [Here's a Hollywood Reporter article on the issue.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/cpac-drops-milo-yiannopoulos-as-speaker-pedophilia-video-controversy-977747/) He was permanently banned from Twitter for harassing Leslie Jones in July 2016, so some doors were already closing for him, but conservatives seemed to really drop him when those clips resurfaced.",1661990523

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&amp;nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&amp;nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

(At this point I consider that a good day.) Or is it going to be like today, where you forget about our (19 year old with chronic diseases) cat's vet appointment, forget to give them their meds, didn't wash out the cat food cans (again), and you're not here? I have no idea where you are, if you work tonight, or when you're coming back. It's like living in a pop-up book from hell.

Oh, you went to get a haircut. Without communicating with me. Again. Then when I calmly point out the lack of communication &amp; what you skipped out on, here comes the defensiveness &amp; stonewalling. And you're out the door again, with no communication, leaving me to clean up the mess you've created.

You've been off 3 days this week and haven't done a goddamn thing around the house, other than wait for the AC repair guy to show up. You couldn't even put away the dishes that I washed. Even our 14 year old is getting sick of your bullshit. 

You keep on about how you can't help it - blah blah blah. I have to constantly accommodate you, but what about my needs? I have told you that I need clear, direct, open communication, and for both of us to follow the plans that we make together. I'm pretty sure I'm on the spectrum, but I get no accomodations from you. It's a double standard &amp; I hate it. I don't feel valued or cared for, and haven't for years.

And the worst part is how you manipulate &amp; twist everything to make it about my reaction. Last time I asked you nicely to wash out the cat food cans (your responsibility), you screamed at me &amp; threw your glasses across the room, then later doubled down on it, saying it was an appropriate reaction to my ""criticism."" 15 years of that on top of having to fight for any scrap of help with the housework &amp; parenting, having to clean up your messes &amp; fuckups, and you wonder why I'm anxious?

He kinda took big steps when heading to and from the stage, and walked fast, they were in heels, so it was a little bit funny. I know, wrong of me to laugh.

During the show, my ex was in a different group setting up, and he said he started singing, ""I'm wanna pee on you, piss on you, yes i do"" a little too loudly in the halls.

Me: sorry but you need to go to the paint desk.

Entitled person: you can go get it for me, I've seen you work at the paint desk and hurry there's somewhere I have to be.

Me: I'm sorry but I'm not supposed to leave my register unattended and I have no experience working at the paint desk.

Person just ignores me and just gives me the ""aren't you going to get it for me"" look, each time I told them I dont know how to mix paint and they have to go get the paints themselves, they just got angrier and angrier by the second still expecting me to get the paint for them. I'm glad my head cashier arrived when she did and spoke to them.

Even though they still refused to get the paint themselves and just grabbed the lid before storming off, yeah the paint might have been still stuck to the lid, but it's not like I know which colors were mixed together to get that specific color. I'm sure if the person was nicer I might have helped them better and even walked them to the paint desk, but they weren't and just demanded me to do it for them using the usual ""I'm in a hurry"" excuse only to stand around on their phone clearly not in a hurry at all",1661990525

&gt; Recently, a new covert class of user has been employed to sway opinion in social media, &amp;quot;Shills.&amp;quot; The general term &amp;quot;Shill&amp;quot; denotes an enthusiastic accomplice.

&gt; 2 Collecting Data to Study Shills The data we collect pertaining to shill accounts comes from Reddit, where we crawled and labeled users posting in a politically-active forum on the site.

&gt; 4 Identifying Shills We apply the data and feature extraction approach to build a classifier that can differentiate shills.

"snakes","t5_2ryfw","Plain-bellied Watersnakes *Nerodia erythrogaster* are medium to large (record 163.6 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in and around water. They are commonly encountered fish and amphibian eating snakes across much of eastern North America and extend into Northern Mexico.

*Nerodia* watersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They secrete a foul smelling substance from the cloaca called musk and can deliver a weak anticoagulant venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need soap and water.

Found throughout eastern North America, it is sometimes confused with the Common Watersnake *Nerodia sipedon* or the Banded Watersnake *N. fasciata*. The best character to diagnose *N. erythrogaster* is its namesake plain belly that varies across the range from yellow to orange. Adult Plain-bellied Watersnakes tend to lose or greatly reduce their banding - adults are often completely two-toned. Banded Watersnakes have even, connecting bands across the top of the snake all the way down the body. *N. erythrogaster* does not. In Common Watersnakes *N. sipedon*, bands typically break up or become mismatched after the first third of the body as in *N. erythrogaster*, but has a patterned belly.


[Range Map](http://snakeevolution.org/rangemaps/Nerodia_erythrogaster.jpg) | [Relevant/Recent Phylogeography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322375/)

This genus is in need of revision using modern molecular methods, but this particular species has been investigated using basic molecular methods. The authors found that, just like many other snakes species, subspecies based on clinal color patterns didn't correspond to evolutionary history. Subspecies should thus not be recognized.




--------------------------------------------------------

While effective in some applications, glue traps generally shouldn't be used outside or in garages, as by-catch of snakes and other harmless animals is difficult to avoid.

Snakes stuck to glue traps are not always a lost cause and can be removed with mild cooking oil such as olive oil or lard. While applying more oil as you go, slowly and gently start with the tail and work your way forward. This should not be attempted by a novice on a venomous snake. Remember to use caution even with nonvenomous species - these animals do not understand your good intentions and will be exhausted, dehydrated and scared. They may try to bite you or themselves in self defense. This advice also applies to many common tape adhesives.

3. Eye focus on forehead or nose, nod at pauses, laugh when they laugh
4. Ask to sit in a corner spot. Prevents some peripheral noise.
5. Say you did not understand what they said and ask to them to repeat what they said

Interpersonal relationship communication:

1. Explain difficulty with the peripheral noise and set a boundary that you need to prepare for it and cannot do it often
2. Is your partner ok with your level of not being able to interact as such? May not be compatible
3. Find other solutions that scratch the itch of socialization in quieter settings
4. Let her go out with friends and you can stay home. Find other quieter opportunities for couply things
5. Find couples counselor to discuss what is going on so you can both feel heard and talk towards solutions.",1661990526

"TrueAnon","t5_221xsa","I saw this linked in a thread somewhere on this sub, and I'm reading it and just thinking to myself: ""Why do they act like this?""

The jargon, the theatrics, the complete lack of self-awareness. I'm not even trying to bait anyone, I'm genuinely curious what has lead to this phenomena where they are LARPing as the Gang of Four ALL THE TIME. This piece is critical of US Maoheads in some regard, but it still uses that same stilted language.

""*The Maoists spent some months preparing to confront the KCDSA this way, trying to muster the forces, strike at an opportune moment, etc.. That they would end up disrupting a DSA event was a foregone conclusion from the moment I became involved and I was conscious of this. However, what did the Maoists intend to achieve outside of some vague and charitable notion of ‚Äúconquering hegemony‚Äù from a political standpoint?*""

This reads like a goddamn pamphlet from 1926 Yan'an and yet its about breaking up some little DSA function. Its so goddamned bizarre.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","You‚Äôre welcome. If you go with them to the doctors appointment follow up, I would bring up the topic of applying for disability in front of both the doctor and your spouse. I would also have a conversation with your spouse that they need to make getting disability their new full-time job. You can literally apply from home starting on the phone, and from there they need to request medical records and get the paperwork sent in. It isnt an easy process to get it, ngl, I‚Äôve been trying to figure this out myself, it is a lot of work to apply for disability, but you have to start somewhere. Even if they were denied for disability, they could still apply for General relief or some kind of financial cash aid program through the state. And their doctor could sign off on it to saying that they are unemployable. We have that option here in California to have unemployable general relief if a person cannot work it‚Äôs not very much money a month only like $350 or so but it‚Äôs still better than nothing. Especially if you‚Äôre in emergency. If disability denies him the first time, tell him to apply a second time because they‚Äôre more likely to accept a second time around. Either way they need to start the process ASAP, and I would just put that as one of your deal breakers on the list, that this is something they need to do. Because if they aren‚Äôt going to keep down a job, then they at least need to have income from disability so they can help pay bills and not burden you. 
Maybe you could write out a small to do list for them that they could do daily. For example: shower, work on disability application for at least 1-3 hours a day, clean for an hour, grocery shop/cook at least one meal for both of you. That could be their daily routine until they go back to work. Best wishes. Sorry you are hurting from this.",1661990526

Seats are determined by first past the post, and regions are weighted differently by having different levels of seats available. You‚Äôre saying our current system doesn‚Äôt make sense (which I would agree with, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be what you‚Äôre trying to argue). I am saying instead of making it convoluted like that literally just count all the votes and determine the amounts of seats the parties have based on how many votes they had **rather than** weighing the ridings by population.

It feels like you‚Äôre just looking for a chance to fight or be passive aggressive here lol",1661990527

So force it was, not unlike the Christians during the Northern Crusades.

"CharacterRant","t5_35frv","Wakfu did it very well with Tristepin and Evangelyne's children they don't look like copies but they aren't far away from their parents design wise either. Especially Flopin you can see both Eva and Tristepin on his face. Their personalities kinda look like genderbent versions of their parents but not too much Elely is clearly walking on her dad's footsteps and got the same overall tastes but she just feels like Elely not like girl-Tristepin I can't even pinpoint the differences it just feels like the core is different while the tastes are the same. Flopin on the other hand is calm and strategic like his mom but you also see his father's short temper and willingness to mess with stuff he shouldn't in him",1661990527

"deppVheardtrial","t5_69haov","&gt; I think in relative terms they are likely close to equal.

There is NO WAY MRAs and sexist incels are supporting Amber.

&gt;Not everything was objectively true

Yes, it was.

&gt;Elements may have been, however on the whole it was deemed false and maliciously so by the Jury. 

The op-ed should not have been judged as pulling in the entire relationship between AH and JD. She spoke broadly. It wasn't the jury who made that call--it was the stupid lower court judges. Only one of them spoke out against the stupidity of it--his name was Judge Moon, I think.

And that is part of what will almost certainly will the appeal for Amber when the case reaches the higher court judges.

&gt;Most of the shit-stirring occurs by ardent Ms. Heard supporters, attacking and denigrating Mr. Depp at every step and corner. Latest being about the recent VMA event.

You can't believe this? SO MANY people hated that, including many of his supporters, such as TUG and Tremaine.",1661990527

And then when black people fought back and finally got equal rights under the law and white people weren‚Äôt legally allowed to exploit and terrorize black people they continued to fight integration legally.
Never made up for the crimes against said black citizens and abandoned them in decaying cities that they had been segregated in by white racists.

"Unexpected","t5_2w67q","Uhh...debatable I think. I've done some light reading on it and to say that EVERY insect feels pain...well you'd have to run test on all of them to confirm. 

Secondly while reading they didn't completely describe it as pain like we feel, and I think it would be hard to determine if they feel pain like we do or differently. Could be more like...a burden style feeling or announce then legitimate pain. 

But they did discover they get chronic pain like we get after injuries, such as aches which definitely leans more towards legitimate pain then what I said above.",1661990529

"anime","t5_2qh22","I guess this is my takeaway from the episode, rather than just as response to you, so I'll type it out. What you said may be correct, but it doesn't absolve her responsibilities in their relationship or place more blame on him.

A relationship is a two-way street, but only one of them understood that. She replaced him entirely with her friends and the only thing she ever did was unknowingly throw it in his face over and over again. She never thought about her own behaviour, nor apologised for any of it, including the overreaction she *was* fully aware of. The blame is not equal, because the fault is not equal and that's why, after reaching out for a reconciliation she didn't reciprocate, he didn't reach out again after that. The ball was in her court, it had actually been there all along, but she had her friends all throughout it, so she could let him hurt and their relationship rot.

There was a lot of poor communication on both sides and they both made mistakes, but the anime objectively makes it very clear she's at fault for the relationship ending entirely. You can't have one person apologise for his reaction to the other person's behaviour while she doesn't apologise for her behaviour nor her overreaction to something else. It's not a tally, though, it doesn't matter who made more mistakes, what matters is how they apologise for it and resolve it and she simply didn't want to do either. He doesn't serve her as a love slave, it has to be a two-way street or that street will have a dead end.

In reality, it was probably never going to work out due to their lack of communication. The only other way (that is, keeping their lack of communication intact) he could have balanced their dynamic was for him to find friends, but even then they would grow apart because she didn't prioritise or reserve any time to invest in their relationship and friendship. They showed her standing him up time and time again: being late to meet him every time, him reaching out to her to hang out but her rejecting him as she was too busy with her friends, her never reaching out and essentially taking him for granted while treating him as a diary to show the crumbling of the relationship being virtually entirely one-sided (apart from the communication issues they both shared).

The show did a really good job on this episode, though, showing two (unequally) immature teenagers not working out their issues and letting the feelings of hurt fester.",1661990529

"Beatmatch","t5_2syix","If they are looking for pop stuff, first thing you should do is to try to back out of this gig. Even if I give you my collection of arab music, you'll have a hard time being able to use it in the right context.

Just like english pop, arab music is very large and nuanced, depending on your crowd, they might not have heard of songs that're killing it in the middle east right now. so it'll definitely take you over a week to understand the music and be able to put up a show that works out well. Specialty gigs like this are best left for djs who specialize in the genre.

&amp;#x200B;

My honest suggestion if you really have no option :  
Shamelessly asking the promoter about what vision they have for this event in terms of music, maybe get their top 10 list of iraqi songs, and figure out the 50 around it through top 40 iraqi and top 40 arab songs from years relative to the target audience's age.

Most importantly, if you don't know arabic, you might have a tough time dealing with requests, so carry 2x rca-3.5mm cables, and adapters for type c and lightning, that way requests can be played through guests' phone.  


If they're looking for house/techno, start researching now. check out acid arab, armen miran, hraach, viken arman, sahale, elfenberg. look for arab ethnic deep house and it'll give you loads of songs. they're a great addition to other sets too.",1661990529

Pelosi had no business going to Taiwan. It's one thing if she wanted to go on vacation, or had business, but she went for political points at China's expense. While basically spitting in their faces, all it did was put pressure on China to be more aggressive with Taiwan.

Taiwan can't afford a war with China, but thinks its okay because it has US support. Look at Ukraine, tens of thousands of deaths. We would be baiting them to their deaths.",1661990530

"news","t5_2qh3l","You seem to be struggling to understand these protections and child support laws were put in place because this right you think men should have actually used to happen all the time but society realized that it was wrong to allow that because it disadvantages the mother and child while the father is left in an advantageous situation. Society has agreed that when a child is born the burden of support should fall on both parents because that's the only ""fair"" outcome for the child. 

I can play your strawman and whataboutisms too. You only seem to care about what's happening when that baby is in the womb but fuck that kid after it's born right. Whether it upsets you or not the facts of how it works is the man's choice comes before conception, you can choose to bust in or you can choose to bust on her titties. The females choice comes after conception and those choices include abortion, having the kid and not even telling the father because he's a fuck boi like you and she doesn't even want her kid around a piece of shit like that or make that fuck boi pay child support. You don't have to think it's fair or equal but your idea of what should be a right for men would just bring society backwards to before 1886. 


By 1886, 11 states had made it a penal offence for a father to abandon or refuse to support his minor children. Typically, it still needed evidence that without this support the children would be a cost to the community. Society realized a long time ago how detrimental it was for a father to not support his offspring whether he had a choice in it or not.",1661990531

I suffer from psoriasis. I don't see anybody online having endless arguments about which psoriasis medication is best. I take the one prescribed by my doctor. It does a good job, and I am happy with it. Thus, I continue to see my doctor. If I didn't like the treatment, I'd find a different doctor.

Likewise, trans people should be able to access the doctor of their choice. If they like the course of treatment, they should stick with it. If they don't like the course of treatment, they can find a new doctor. There is no reason for public discourse to enter this calculus.",1661990531

Fix One:  
Check your system environment for  JAVA\_HOME variable make sure it's set to JDK greater then version 11.  Eclipse looks at the JAVA\_HOME variable to find the JDK.  


Fix Two:  
edit the eclipse.ini and add these lines:  
after the line --launcher.appendVmargs  
add:  
\-vm  
path to jdk /bin/ javaw.exe

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","I think all dogs are capable of violence, and all dogs are capable of being snuggly teddy bears.

Pitbulls and bully mixes are terriers. They have incredibly strong jaws that are designed to be strong and latch on to their prey, shake, and kill.  That goes for all terriers, scotties, wheatons, schnauzers, all of them. Even Yorkies, at one point. The thing about pitbulls and bully mixes is that their prey drive and breed instincts were taken advantage of and used for dog fights, which put them in the hands of people who don't know how to actually take care of a dog. They became a status thing, where people wanted a tough dog so they got a pitbull, then didn't do anything to train it or left it outside chained up. You leave a golden retriever changed up outside all the time, it'll get pissed off too.

All that being said, I haven't personally met a pitbull/mix that wasn't the sweetest lovebug. I did have to go to the hospital after being bit by a corgi who bit me so hard I got a bone bruise.

I think anyone who leaves a newborn, infant, toddler, or small child unattended with a dog is stupid. I think it's important to teach your child from as early as possible how to be respectful of dogs and not tug, climb, or pull. Dogs are unpredictable, even if they are extremely tolerant, anything can set them off. A cute photo op with the baby laying on a curled up lab can turn deadly real quick if the baby falls and scares the dog, causing it to snap at the baby's face. Animals are unpredictable, and children are unpredictable.  It's just not a safe combination.",1661990531

The biggest difference is that their eyes are much more sensitive to much lower intensities of this visible light due to a reflective layer behind their retinas, effectively giving them the ability to see very well in almost perfect darkness. Glass let's through all visible light, and even many frequencies of light that we can't see, like infrared so even to a cat, glass is perfectly transparant. The glasses in our eye-glasses might have coatings that reduce reflections or are scratch resistant or even UV resistant but none of those actually inhibit the passing through of any visible light.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","1/10. The problem is the chaotic nature of this universe even though it is so predetermined and orderly. Living beings are just too small relative to the space we occupy. We are at the whims of the forces of physics larger than we can withstand. Powerless to grow to the mass required within our lifetime. 

Human life, as well as all life we know on earth are bound to a short existence. Recycling the mass over and over again. This has enabled our own existence, but at what cost? The suffering of all living creatures is not to be considered for the evolution of our descendants. We are supposed to take kindly to these systems at work. 

Our individual existence is meaningless. It is meaningless because it is temporary. Our purpose for life is to continue the cycle of recycling matter for a continued existence. If not, then it is to experience the existence we already live daily. This is where my critical opinion comes into the low score. 

To live is to suffer in my opinion. Think of all the life that has died and how they may have died in anguish. Some never had a chance to live. Maybe that was a good thing. Now think of all the life in the future that will suffer. The point is that living in this universe is stacked against the individual organism. Survival of the fittest guarantees that the cycle continues. At least until the end of living life on earth.

In the meanwhile we as living beings get to suffer and enjoy inner strife with existence. I give it a 1 for at least giving me an individual experience of the lifetime I have endured.",1661990531

no secret i dont think this should be sold.   


Before they got this, i have alot of respect for them myself, they provided to the masses without care of being possible caugt, they still do. but now mix this delta 8 in all their oils, both vape, topical and for oral use.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","II‚Äôm sorry that you had to go through that, but I‚Äôm glad that you were able to have that time with her. 

My father died two years ago this past Saturday. About 7 yrs ago, he had leukemia and went through treatment that surprisingly wasn‚Äôt too harsh on him. But, it left him with failing kidneys and he had to go through hemodialysis every night. In addition, he was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs a few yrs later. Over the years, it took its toll and his quality of life slowly declined. One day, the doc found he had therapy-related AML, which is extremely aggressive. Average life expectancy for young, healthy individuals is less than a year, even with treatment. Being 72, my dad was given less than a month. So rather than suffer, he came home and spent his last week with the family. My mom, 3 siblings, and I were able to take time off work and school and just focus on him. We talked about favorite memories, he ate his favorite meals, family members came by to see him, he called his siblings. 

I‚Äôll always miss him and wish I had more time with him, instead of only 26 yrs. But I‚Äôm so incredibly grateful for the way it played out. He was able to spend his last days with everyone he loved, say his goodbyes, and wasn‚Äôt in pain. It also made the grieving process easier for us, because it allowed us the chance to somewhat come to terms with it all. We were able to focus on him without worrying about other responsibilities or obligations and made sure we didn‚Äôt have any regrets, wishing we did this or say that. Of all the ways that he could have died, I can‚Äôt think of a better way for it to have happened. 

You are absolutely right. It was hauntingly beautiful.",1661990532

Dota2 and Overwatch for example give all players a rating and them dump them into tiers based on that rating.

The biggest problem IMO is that the seasons in Unite are so short and reset ranking for essentially no reason every time they cycle.

I hope the number colors and fonts are good tho. That could improve the look a bit. Really hoped Nike was listening to fans over the last few years but guess not... It is the first time this new eq staff (new since 2018) at us soccer got to be involved in a wc kit.

"ArtistLounge","t5_2yjxy","Yeah I don‚Äôt like it one bit. I‚Äôm personally terrified by the prospect of these ai programs. I make my living off of illustration and design and I really do worry about how to navigate this. Initially I think it will probably not be efficient enough to create commissions without a human element involved. So while im not happy about having to learn how to use this stuff I feel some comfort knowing that it will likely still require practical skills to be able to work in the field, with or without ai. It may even be a great tool for creating a sketch to work off of for an original piece. I do think eventually this devalues artistic skills on a large scale though and the ai is going to keep getting better and to what end I don‚Äôt know.

I think it‚Äôs important to remind myself and others in my position that if this technology eliminates the need for professional artists then it is 100% effecting hundreds if not thousands of other industries. Not saying that‚Äôs a good thing but I really think it‚Äôs going to come to UBI because other than maybe manual labor, most jobs will be effected by artificial intelligence.",1661990534

"bobdylan","t5_2qi0m","Since leaving the Steve Hoffman forums, I miss most of the rumors so this just made my day. 

As someone who got into Dylan around 1991, TOOM was a big deal for me. First album of originals during my fandom. I‚Äôm equally excited. 

I remember rumors of Red River Shore being a lost gem and it lived up to my expectations when it finally saw the light of day. Here‚Äôs hoping for the rumored longer version of Highlands. Something tells me it needed the editing, but still. I‚Äôd rank it among my top songs by him so any insights would be a huge personal deal. Would also love some better quality versions of one of the sped up live performances. 

I for one hope for enough stripped down takes to create a satisfying alternate listen. I suspect there‚Äôs enough material, but surely a ‚ÄúLanois-era‚Äù covering TOOM and Oh Mercy would itself be great.

"gme_meltdown","t5_3vpfzk","I had puts spreads right before the split, and talked about them here.

I ended up closing before the most recent pump at around $34ish, they were only 2 weeks out mostly.


Someone else followed me in with longer term puts, the August ones, but the pump made him hit his stop loss.


It‚Äôs funny because if he had picked September he would be massively green now instead, even with the pump.



And that is the problem with puts and why I honestly vastly prefer shorts, and potentially even these new short ETFs, for GameStop.

It‚Äôs only generally predictable, it‚Äôs hard to pick specific dates, except for instances like the split where you **know** it‚Äôs going down rapidly.

I didn‚Äôt buy puts for this decrease because I didn‚Äôt know how much longer it would languish here, but I still knew it was going down.


If that user had gone short he would have never hit his stop loss and would be massively green.


I know GME is going to go down, I definitely know it‚Äôs going to hit $20($80) again.

But I don‚Äôt know exactly when, and then it might pump again and I‚Äôll do it when it stabilizes again.  Shorts are much better for GME, you‚Äôre basically guaranteed to win if you can hold it long enough and don‚Äôt get crazy with margin or going too far in.",1661990537

After the economic collapse of 2010 evrything became miserable. It's like all the old clubbers died. Now in most places they even let in minors who wear track suits. Guys in the good old days had to be impeccably dressed to be allowed in the cool clubs and in many cases they had to be escorted by a woman.

The silicon flexes well, so I don't notice it on the sides of my head while sleeping. Probably the only thing I notice is a little breathing noise before I fall asleep, but it's only audible to me, so must be a bit of bone conduction going on. It's not enough to keep me awake.

It feels more immersive to be able to naturally look around an environment with my head and manipulative virtual objects with my hands. As we‚Äôll as the other things I mentioned in my previous comment.       
    
I play PCVR games from my computer wirelessly to my Q2 with maximum graphics. I have a head strap with a battery counterweight that is comfortable for very long periods of time, I keep the nose hole open to not get sweaty and maybe use a fan, my record is 5.5 hours. I do feel like being able to walk around by turning in real life, without having to worry about the cord becoming tangled, adds to the experience and makes it feel more real.        
        
I agree that after hours in a game like half life Alyx you are no longer constantly wowed by the fact that you‚Äôre in a virtual world. You know what else gets monotonous, actual reality. Are you constantly floored by the fact that things seem 3 dimensional in real life and that you can touch/manipulate things? If you go to a shooting range, after 2 hours of shooting are you still going ‚Äúomg I can feel the gun in my hands, and when I hit a target it actually deforms!‚Äù? If you truly feel like you are in a space, eventually it becomes normal. As a human being you cannot possibly have absolute excitation, continuously, forever. You get used to anything. But the changes in how you interact with the environment are still persistent. And that adds intrigue to the potential of the game. I cannot see how VR, even in its current form, does not contribute more interesting challenges to gameplay. Every game I have experienced that is converted to VR is improved simply by the fact that it is in VR. Valheim is a good example.",1661990539

"Sparkdriver","t5_28wtn1","I had a tip reduced by someone i delivered to and saw face to face two days ago. I did everything right as far as an average reasonable person's expectations go, and she even saw me take her cold stuff and ice cream out of a ~*Premium*~ cold bag. I had to substitute for two of her items and they were great as far as substitutions go, but at any rate they were the only feasible substitutions in the store. There were no other comparable options. She didn't choose ""no substitutions"" so I had to pick something. I'm guessing that's why but who knows. Maybe it was because her delivery was late because no one would take her order. Anyway it makes me mad and I'm not going to deliver there again so good luck to her. It's unreasonable. Half these people can't get anyone to pick up their orders for multiple hours, because they suck or because they live somewhere ridiculous.  One good thing though, on the same night someone with a HUGE third floor order tipped me $20. I couldn't believe it. But I'm pretty sure I only got that order because no one would pick it up. The other apartment in the batch had a $2 tip and was impossible to find, on the third floor also lol. I'll go back to the $20 place any day. 

It's not just that I get paid less for the time I worked, it's also that it makes it harder to plan for how much I need to work to meet my needs and goals, and it's stressful not knowing if you're going to get ripped off and have to make it up later

Anyway. They shouldn't be able to pull ""tips"" (bids) and hopefully people will stop delivering to them.",1661990540

For the student with the preferred name, move on with using the preferred name. Make sure it goes in the sun plans. Talk to her about if you should use it with other teachers and her parents. If you're talking to her one-on-one, you can apologize (Hey, I'm sorry about calling you the wrong name yesterday. I've changed it on my attendance so it shouldn't happen again).

My biggest mistake when I started was caring more about getting through content than classroom management. I would start holding a clipboard during presentations like that and taking verbatim notes. The more verbatim, the better. Suzie said something inappropriate in class is very different than emailing ""Suzie informed the class that her hobbies are being a bad bitch and sucking dick"", or Johnny keeps talking out of turn versus "" Johnny interrupted eight presentations by calling out ""yo mama""."" I would tell them straight up tomorrow if they wouldn't say it infront of their guardians or the principal, they should not be saying it in class.

I hate to say it, but being at school a bit early and being organized (having tech set up, or at least checking it will work) will help you feel calmer and look more authoritative. If you need five minutes for tech, give them something to do-- read your book, answer this question and discuss with your partner. I wish I had started with more structure. I had a crazy grade 8 class (foreign language) that started with 5 minutes silent reading and then 5 minutes word of the day. Students knew what they needed to do and I had time to set up my computer and put out the sheets/materials we were using for the period. IDK what grade or subject you teach, but I highly recommend ""bell work"" for structure and for you. It also sets the expectation that when they come in, class has started and they need to do work.

Practise routines with them. It will feel silly, but it's important. My kids started taking a long time to take out their books and I told them okay it took 5 minutes for you to all take out books. Let's put them away. Okay, now take out your book. Better, that was one minute-- Mr. Smith's class can do it in 30 seconds. Put your books away. Okay, books out!! Nice!! 17 seconds! I'll have to tell Mr. Smith's class...

"mormon","t5_2qky2","It's a great question.  To start, I think it's okay for reasonable people to disagree a bit on Joseph's abilities.  We have zero literary products of his before the BoM, and the accounts of his abilities and knowledge (all from later on, often with some bias) vary and are somewhat contradictory.  Hence, there are different models that can fit the relatively scant data regarding his abilities, especially before the BoM.

In some part, I think the question assumes too much effort in assimilating ideas from one's environment (and I'm okay if we disagree on that).  When you are in an environment and care about a thing, then it's not particularly difficult to have thoughts about those things.  And, hundreds of thousands of people write books every year and most books contain hundreds or thousands of ideas and the vast majority of them are simply pulled from the authors experience or interests (just speaking generally). Most importantly, the argument isn't that Joseph had read every book with every idea in it, it's merely that all these books are manifestations of the ideas that people were _already_ concerned with.  These were people obsessed with Christian ideas--there's a reason it was called the ""burned over"" district and why at least  2 other major US-born denominations derive from _that_ rough time and place.

More specifically, I think there are some great indicators of Joseph Smith's deep interest in the subject of religion, even from a very young age.  The best ones, IMO, are in his [1832 statement and reflected in his 1830 Colesville letters](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/religious-interest-and-capability-from-1832-statement/).  I'll walk through my interpretation of his 1832 journal account:

* ‚Äú‚Ä¶Parents who spared no pains to instructing me in the christian religion‚Äù (well instructed in the Christian religion by parents)
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶my mind become seriously imprest with regard to the all importent concerns for the wellfare of my immortal Soul‚Ä¶‚Äù (deeply interested in religious issues)
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶led me to searching the scriptures‚Ä¶‚Äù (he not only read but searched the scriptures)
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶thus applying myself to them [the scriptures]‚Ä¶‚Äù (not only reading but applying ideas in them)
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶and my intimate acquaintance with those of differant denominations‚Ä¶‚Äù (on some non-trivial level he was interacting with those from, and hence ideas, from different denominations)
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶led me to marvel excedingly for I discovered that they did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository this was a grief to my Soul‚Ä¶‚Äù (he understood scripture well enough to decide that various religionists were acting contrary to them)
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶from the age of twelve years to fifteen I pondered many things in my heart concerning the sittuation of the world of mankind the contentions and divisions the wickedness and abominations and the darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind my mind become excedingly distressed‚Ä¶‚Äù (he‚Äôs searching the scriptures and also pondering the differences [‚Äúcontentions and divisions‚Äù] between denominations and interpreting their stances as ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù probably since they did not conform to his understanding of scripture. This wasn‚Äôt a mere pasttime, his mind became ‚Äúexceedingly distressed‚Äù from this reflection)
* ‚Äú‚Ä¶for I become convicted of my sins and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatised from the true and liveing faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament and I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world‚Ä¶‚Äù (his understanding of the Bible was deep enough to convict him of his fallness and also that the various societies aroudn him varied from the Bible)

Then we have the Colesville letters. Frederick analyzed them for Biblical allusion and noted with regard to the first letter:

&gt; ‚Ä¶ other than the very first sentence, every sentence contains at least one biblical quotation, allusion, or echo, with many of them containing more than one.

Finally, there is the account of Joseph as a ""very passable [Methodist] exhorter"" and in the ""juvenile debating club"" which Orasmus Turner claimed was focused on ""questions of moral or political ethics"" (Orasmus Turner 1851).  In my opinion, these two activities would provide someone with the kinds of familiarity and mastery over theological issues (passable exhorter) and political ones (think about how much of the BoM is focused on systems of government and threats to the govt).

There are [other sources supporting Joseph's religious interest and capabilites](https://faenrandir.github.io/a_careful_examination/joseph-smith-capable-of-authoring-the-book-of-mormon/), but that's plenty for this one comment.

in this case Venus will get the most negative influence out of this, due to the nature of said planets

After that launch it using webui.cmd file and thats it!

I believe there is an instruction on how to install in repos, so I think it will be not so hard

Good luck!

UPD: Forgot to mention how to turn on optimized mode
Edit relauncher.py and add flag ""--lowvram"" to line

os.system(""python scripts/webui.py"")

not only were they fast to respond and order the item, but the process was so simple and easy and they really are legit. i got everything much faster than i was expecting and it was packed so well. they do have some fees on top of the cost of shipping, but they made the process so easy and it wasn't actually too crazy expensive to get what i ordered over to me.

The standard Prelude is full of warts and Relude fixes a lot of them.
The arguments to 'stick with Prelude even though it sucks because everyone else does' is just not convincing. Relude documentation  is excellent. It also  has a custom hlint file for editor linting.

The unwillingness to fix old mistakes is what is holding haskell back. If you are a library author and you use relude, you are promoting healthy positive growth in the haskell ecosystem.

"streamentry","t5_3f7zb","For people who have a tendency towards depression, I suggest building a strong base of positive emotions in your practice. 

- Physical calm and joy, mental happiness and tranquillity

- The four divine mental states of loving kindness, compassion, taking joy and happiness in the good qualities of others, and equal mindedness.

Practicing loving kindness mindfulness towards oneself, before attempting to spread towards others is essential - if the well's not overflowing in us, how can we give water out to others. Loving kindness towards ourselves helps us to develop mindfulness of mind, and to treat those mind states with gentleness and compassion. 

[Loving Kindness Mindfulness - Basic Instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/scoig8/mindfulness_of_loving_kindness/)

I'd reccomend that those with a tendency towards depression also make their base of moral behaviour rock solid. Maintaining the five precepts is essential for safe spiritual progress:

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/pancasila.html

Finally, those with a history of depression should leave aside contemplation of anatta, or not-self, until their minds are happy and strong. Any thought that 'I have no self' should be put aside as inappropriate attention - according to the Buddha that's not the correct way to think to find peace. 

Instead, just focus on the impermanence of any negative thoughts and experiences that come to you - whatever mood or negativity that comes to the mind, see it as temporary, without any true substance. Don't give it nutriment by taking it to be real or permanent. Ajahn Chah is helpful for seeing things in this way:

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/chah/atasteof.html#mind

Most importantly, to reiterate OP's message, seek professional assistance of you're struggling with your mood.

Best wishes to you OP (and to any struggling with their mental health) - may you be well and happy.",1661990542

A wheat starter should rise higher than one with rye due to the better mix of gluten.

The balance between the different bacteria and yeasts can change depending on the food as the different strains eat different nutrients. The bacteria Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis needs maltose; starches in wheat can give off some when broken down but rye has maltose ready to go.

Of course most of us have no idea what cultures we have in our starters, specifically. But it seems to me to be a good idea to include flours you're going to bake with when feeding your starter. Will it generally be fine if you don't? Sure.",1661990542

So in practice, it recovers after every battle once the PCs are safe again.

Actual injuries are represented by damage to the PC's STR stat. If a PC takes more damage than their HP, then the extra damage goes to their STR stat and they have a chance of being incapacitated. The procedures for recovering STR damage vary slightly by game, but usually involves medical attention and resting for some time, or magical healing.

On that note, when PCs take damage outside of combat like from traps or environmental hazards, that's dealt directly to their STR score.",1661990543

Sharing information like this is helpful because you almost get the opinions of other specialists vicariously, even though we‚Äôre different bodies and situations. Rectocele surgery is not from all the research I‚Äôve done, hugely successful and I won‚Äôt have it. Especially since it can entrap the pudendal nerve if done incorrectly and the failure raise is about 25% or maybe more. My current pt told me my pf should be strong enough to counteract it. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre UG said not to have surgery and that it isn‚Äôt causing the pain. Also I have a Labral tear on my right hip and that did cause me issues on the right side when I first injured my hip. I think a lot of this PN is from musculoskeletal imbalances, or BV it a UTI or atrophy. So sick of that hypertonic pelvic floor and yes vulvodynia too. Because there‚Äôs no real treatment for that either. And don‚Äôt get me started on dispensing gabapentin for it. It sucks and my pt who is a doctor told me it makes pain worse and research shows it‚Äôs not recommended for pelvic pain anymore.

The pay is low and the risk is incredibly high that things don't work out for you, but the debt stays.  Medical, busted checkride, accidents etc.  Those things all have the potential to drop your income potential from flying to zero while you are saddled with the debt.  Funding aviation training through loans is a high risk low return.  People do it because it's an incredibly appealing and exciting career, but I would never recommend it.

Full disclaimer, my training was entirely paid for by the military.  From hour zero to now (ATP) I have not paid a dime and have in fact been paid an average of about 110k a year.  Of course, the cost there is lack of control of my time, obligated service, high risk operations, mental and physical health etc...so I wouldn't necessarily recommend the military either, but my response is obviously biased towards my path.

Good, solitary confinement as a punishment is cruel and unusual punishment, and needs to be abolished

I understand we have issues with them, but solitary confinement is literally mental torture. I used to work in the prison system myself, (Extradition Officer) it is an inhumane practice.

I am fully aware we don't have other options with violent offenders, but we cannot keep them in solitary unless they make violent threats or we think they are going to attack / kill another inmate.

There is a lengthy wait time for both meeting with the surgeon and scheduling the surgery. On top of this you need a signed document from both your PCP and a mental health expert for the state I live in, a very blue state. If you don‚Äôt have a therapist you need to get one and have enough time together to foster a relationship as to where they can sign off on the surgery. 

And again I am a full adult, I can only imagine the hoops to get a surgery like this and quite frankly I don‚Äôt know why they would when hormone blockers (something completely reversible) are available.",1661990544

I am not actually invested in any of these definitions; most of what Dinosaur serves isn‚Äôt *my* idea of BBQ, but it is very good grilled meat. And of course it is what, say, Tennesseans might call BBQ, (I think. I am not well-versed in BBQ traditions outside of North Carolina).",1661990544

This is rooted in the idea that at the end of the game, both Omori and HS Sunny are not characters. A common mistake is the idea that HS Sunny *is* Sunny, but that is not true. Omori, HS Sunny, and the entirety of headspace all together form the whole which is DREAMER (rw Sunny). This is also the distinction between Sunny (in dream) and DREAMER.

The Azovites illegally took the government and at that point the constitution is dead. Then the Donbas wanted to be recognized as independent states because they no longer could rely on that constitution, coupled with the fact that thousands of them were slaughtered just for being Eastern Ukrainian. Russia came to their aid, coupled with coming to put an end to NATOs encroachment.

Gorbachov said not one inch past Germany East and NATO continued to expand, violating that agreement. The US destroyed all of the open skies treaties in the area. Acts of aggression were in place long before Russia invaded and by the US' supposed 'Rules-Based Order', they were within their right to defend their sovereignty. I certainly think Putin could have tried other avenues with energy restrictions, but even with thousands dying, the West doesn't care.

This. The more money artists and record companies make by re-releasing old music the more music will get released. I personally would prefer to use sources such as Delak's yt channel because channels such as his typically have the best audio quality, the most music and those songs are typically not an edited version. Channels such as his are without a doubt the best overall uploads on yt. There is however more concerns to keep in mind than just showcasing a good yt channel. At least for me. With how hard it is to get old music officially re-released I prioritize official sources to help in whatever small way to keep them financially interested in continuing to release old music. While it probably is not much revenue it's something at least. Dedicated fans fill in the gaps of what remains unreleased digitally. That gap is of course also massive. There is much more digitally unreleased music from the vinyl era than there is re-releases. So both unofficial and official uploads play an important role. I think of like this. See look, check it out, we noticed! Platipus released some more of their back catalogue. Also Delak still has those other songs they haven't gotten to yet. Wink wink. Hey Platipus, maybe you should get to that. 

I would bet well over 90% of what is on yt has been uploaded by fans. They play a dominant role in music preservation and the showcasing of their chosen style of music. If it wasn't for them subs such as this could not exist. We'd run out of music waiting for official releases. We've even had discussions about which are the best channels on yt for Trance. We should just try and make it known that we realized some artists music got a re-release is all.",1661990546

But if you draw 1 trap, 3 handtraps and a single monster, and it gets negated, you Lost the match, if you have a deck with cards that have a cost and happen to even have 2 monsters, you end with half a board.

Imo you don't ever want more than 2 handtraps on your hand, having 9 in the deck makes it very posible, have 12 and you might even end with a hand full of handtraps, if every hand is going to be a good hand, like you would want in a tournament, in my opinion you should limit yourself to 6",1661990546

"thenetherlands","t5_30hrx","&gt;En toch snap ik wel wat /u/I-secNewton zegt. Ik vind niet dat ik echt een heel royaal salaris heb. Het is goed om van te leven, maar bij mijn schalen ben ik binnen no-time uitgegroeid. Ik zit buiten de CAO beloning, daardoor krijg ik alleen de inflatiecorrecties, terwijl ik nog lang niet op het maximale loon in mijn vakgebied zit (als je de stappen van de vakbond volgt). De aanbiedingen die ik momenteel krijg, liggen behoorlijk hoger dan wat ik volgens de CAO maximaal kan verdienen. Schaal 11 in de Metaal en Techniek gaat tot net geen 4300. Is een mooi salaris, maar in bepaalde functies kan je verder door en moet je het allemaal maar zelf doen. Een periodiek krijg je niet, want je bent niet ingeschaald volgens de CAO.  
  
Dat staat los van de inflatie en koopkracht, komt door de krapte op de arbeidsmarkt. En staat dus ook los van de CAO's.  
  
&gt;Daarbij: Ik vind de CAO niet echt uitnodigend voor jongeren. Dat is vooral de schuld van de werkgevers, maar ik kan als hoger opgeleide mijn eigen pad veel beter bepalen. Ik ben, letterlijk, beter af zonder vakbond. Natuurlijk is die 42,50 en 392,50 van afgelopen juli een leuke meenemer, maar serieus, 42,50? Een van mijn vorige werkgevers heeft mij een keer gepoogd een verhoging van iets van zo'n bedrag te geven, die heb ik nog net niet vierkant in zijn gezicht uitgelachen. Dat is gewoon een belediging.  
  
Dat is voor een groep mensen ook zo. Met als gevolg dat zij denken dat zij het goed voor elkaar hebben, maar de grote groep kan fluiten naar de rest, het draait om volume en solidariteit. Verenig je je als werknemer niet, kan je er soms zelf goed van worden, maar als groep werknemers ben je gewoon zwaar idioot om het niet te doen. Zeker niet als je beseft dat de werkgevers het wel doen en daar redelijk wat zaken mee geregeld krijgen.  
(En voor degene die zegt: ja maar, mijn baas doet dat niet --&gt; hij profiteert wel degelijk van wat werkgeversverenigingen voor elkaar krijgen)  
  
&gt;Bij mijn vorige werkgever is de CAO tegen mij gebruikt, want ""we kregen al 7% van de CAO"". Dat dit over 2 jaar was en ook de collega's die de kantjes er vanaf liepen dit kregen, tsja. Geen budget meer voor extra salarissen. Kutsmoes natuurlijk, maar daar heb je het dan maar mee te doen.  
  
Ligt niet aan de CAO maar aan een slechte werkgever die dat soort werknemers niet aanpakt en goede werknemers niet wil belonen.  
  
&gt;Als ik kijk naar de praktijk, val ik eigenlijk overal een beetje buiten. Ik ben te jong voor ouwelulledagen (die steeds verder worden weggezet), ik ben te hoog opgeleid voor de opleidingsplannen, ik teveel om in een schaal geplaatst te worden maar te weinig om er volledig buiten te vallen. Dat zegt niet dat ik tegen deze zaken ben, ik ben nog altijd voorstander van het steunen van de mensen in een zwakkere onderhandelingspositie, maar lid van de vakbond ben ik daarom nog niet geworden. En dan vind ik 17,75 terwijl ik zelf telkens in onderhandeling moet met mijn werkgever best veel geld.

My Dad then didn't talk to me for year because I had rudeness to chestfeed my kid at house without covering with blanket, etc. Suuuper conservative.  Mean Trump voting kind.

A few years after birth, during and after divorce, my parents blamed my ex-partners infidelity and leaving me, on my queerness and polyamory.

When I came out as nonbinary, and introduced my nonbinary partner to Mom, she said I'd always be her beautiful daughter, and she refused to use ""grammatically incorrect"" pronouns for me, or my kid, who is also enby.

"WhitePeopleTwitter","t5_35n7t","I always find this a little difficult. On a personal level I accept how both of them dress. Everyone should wear what they're comfortable with. 

But on a societal level it becomes trickier because both of these clothing standards symbolise misogyny to me. I understand that modesty standards vary with time and culture and that they're mostly arbitrary. But it does bother me when we apply different modesty standards to men and women which is the case for both of these head coverings.

But again, I'm never gonna be mad because someone wants to dress more ""modest"" because that is their personal choice. My strife is on a more abstract level",1661990547

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Meghan doesn‚Äôt need to exactly replicate Diana‚Äôs status for Harry to see aspects of Diana in her. In my opinion the similarities he sees to Diana are:

1) she‚Äôs an outsider. At the time Diana was a bit unusual as a choice as she was not royalty herself. She was quite lonely in the palace and her own marriage given she had to contend with Camilla. Meghan similarly had expressed feelings of isolation and loneliness during her time in the royal family. On top of that you have her race and nationality both which makes her different from the rest of the royal family. 

2) she has positioned herself against The Firm and wants to take a modern approach to royalty. Diana seemed very modern at the time with how she approached her charity work and raising the kids. Meghan has attempted a similar approach (though I‚Äôd argue a bad attempt) with her posed charity work, the types of press she puts out, photographers she used etc‚Ä¶ Meghan also seemed to want to get involved in political activism which you could argue was similar to things like Diana‚Äôs work on land mines. 

3) victim of the press. Diana was definitely hounded by the press. Meghan has complained about the same thing. Harry came out with a statement on this while they were just dating. He‚Äôs made comments since about not wanting his wife to be a victim of the press the same way his mother was (especially as he blames the paparazzi for her death) 

4) star power. Diana was undoubtedly a huge star. Meghan in my view has come nowhere close. But it seems obvious from their comments that Harry believes Meghan has star power to the point that they were getting lots of press attention and therefore entitled to more from the royal family. Hence all the comments they‚Äôve made since about how the rest of the family were jealous of this attention and so tried to put them in their place. This is very similar to how Diana talked about Charles being jealous of the attention she got even though he was the future King.

5) use of the media and PR to connect to people. Diana had the Martin Bashir interview. Meghan had Oprah. Again I‚Äôd say Meghan has been very poor at connecting directly with the people and has actually turned a lot of people off. But similar to Diana she has used the press to get her message out directly and is not scared to go against the party line from the palace. 

Now to be clear I don‚Äôt actually agree with all these comparisons.

But this is what I think Harry thinks. This is what he sees when he looks at Meghan. Someone very similar to his dead mother. Which is why he didn‚Äôt listen to his brothers warnings to take it slowly. Any attempt by the royal family to make him see sense would have been in his mind similar to the way they sidelined Diana after the divorce and seemingly gave her no support during the marriage to Charles.",1661990547

Faking both a miscarriage and serious medical incident in that short of a time period screams some sort of other issues at play.

You have every right to limit contact with her, as long as you understand the consequences of your actions might be limiting contact with your brother too. Your brother also has a right to be with her, so long as he accepts the consequences of the distance it creates within the family.

I had a similar instance happen to me when I was a few years younger than you. It was incredibly sad and traumatic and I haven‚Äôt spoken to my brother in now 12 years. That being said, my best piece of advice for you is to let it go. Don‚Äôt live in some weird middle ground or let yourself be the go between for other family members who want to live in that middle ground sans consequences. I did that for 2 years and it was incredibly stressful. I have found an immense sense of peace in simply letting him go. There are some days when I consider reaching out to him, but I know the consequences of bringing his now wife back into my life would be too much for me.

Stay strong and prioritize YOUR mental health. Not your brothers, not your parents, not your siblings. Don‚Äôt let people guilt you, especially your brother. Sending hugs.",1661990547

Maybe you should pay her back for the car, that would be a nice chunk of spending money.  And she's working fulltime doing the childcare and all the other stuff she does around the house.

NSW govt is the largest employer in NSW. It is a market maker. If other public service workers get 4% increase, this will force private sectors to increase wages to match and retain workers.

So... the RTBU is actually fighting for wage increase for all of us indirectly.

"aoe2","t5_2sg7u","My advice, that some people may disagree with: Play against the AI and pause the game ANY TIME you're confused, overwhelmed, or in trouble. Abuse the pause button in single player. This is ""cheating"" in a way; obviously you won't be able to get away with pausing every 30 seconds in an online game, but pausing excessively in single player helps you learn what to do to actually win games. Just a few games of abusing the pause button and you'll be beating the Extreme AI pretty handily.

Now, critics of the concept may say, ""You're learning bad habits!"" but that's the genius of this method: in AoE2, this bad habit is such an easy fix. Once you're beating the Extreme AI with pausing, create a new hotkeys profile, and unbind your pause key. Lower the AI difficulty back down a bit (Standard, Moderate, maybe Hard) and play your new hotkey profile. Now, your pause button does nothing, so even if you hit that key out of habit, nothing happens. Now you're back to playing the game with no pausing, and I think you'll be surprised at how easily you wipe the AI.

I'm still pretty new to this game, but this is how I learned and it was really effective. Like learning to ride a bike with training wheels before taking them off.

Don't be afraid to slow the game down too! A lot of AoE2 is muscle-memory, which humans develop better when practiced more slowly! I think Casual speed is great for practicing build orders or hotkeys or anything of the sort.

As for videos, I have to recommend Hera's Guide to 2k - Definitive Edition. Those videos are so straight-forward, and he packs so much valuable information into them that it's insane. I found that series as a complete beginner (new to AoE, first RTS I ever played) and it taught me a huge portion of what I know about Age. If you prefer another creator's style, that's totally fair, but Hera's guides really worked for me.

Also, remember to have fun. If you're not having fun, try to make THAT your top priority. It's a lot harder to improve at something that you're not enjoying.",1661990549

"NoMansSkyTheGame","t5_325lr","Stack limitations do add difficulty. You have to think a bit more on what to keep. Death is also a bit more costly when you lose stuff, or even have to start over in the case of permadeath.

In Normal you can just YOLO about jetpacking off a cliff or something and not give a shit without having a manual save nearby, even if you're carrying something irreplacable in general cargo.

Oh, and AI-mining and the like is more of a hassle, so at least I skipped that and went for more complicated ways of making units fast.

I'm also under the impression that sentinels and pirates hit slightly harder in survival and have a bit more HP, but I might be wrong about that, and it hardly matters when you're all loaded up with good mods 

That's said, I see your point to some extent.

It's a pretty easy game even at its hardest when you've played for a little while. When I started, stuff like those abominations by abandoned buildings were almost scary, and I hid from them (after they ate me the first time), and those things from enticing lures had me running towards shore. Now I just facetank everything, and sometimes I'll trigger sentinels along with the monsters to keep things from getting boring.

Derelicts used to feel like a challenge as well, but now it's more like a cleaning simulator, sometimes.

Likewise, the only way pirates are dangerous anymore is if I'm on foot.

&amp;nbsp;

Some people said something similar to what you say, but about the Leviathan expedition. It was sooo bad and it was just 'artifical' difficulty or something. And that's just bullshit. It's a game ‚Äî everything is artifical. A lot of that whining just sounded like people didn't want any sort of difficulty, even a little, and tried to rationalize it away.",1661990550

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; People don‚Äôt want to believe their back pain, knee pain, uncontrollable high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, inflammatory conditions like IBD and SLE could be helped first and foremost, some even cured, by weight loss. They want an easier solution 

This aspect of your comment is quite problematic on its own.  Research has shown us that the largest determinant of health is socioeconomic status, more than behavior (diet, exercise, etc.).  Furthermore, even in the behavior area there's increasing evidence that mental health and other underlying conditions (e.g. chronic pain, hypothyroidism) are likely playing a much larger role than lack of discipline.

Just as patients like easy solutions, doctors like easy assessments.  Medical training has traditionally focused on symptom alleviation rather than understanding root causes or establishing trust with the patient.  The fact that many professionals are overworked does not help in the empathy department.

&gt;  If you are overweight, please take care of yourself.

This is simply not effective advice.  Holistic approaches to medicine may prove much more effective - i.e. integration of local primary care with nutrition support (e.g. subsidized fresh groceries for low-income patients), mental health support, and community (helps with establishing trust).  Just telling a patient to eat better and exercise more is like telling a homeless person to just get a job.

All the above perspective I'm borrowing from the director of one of our local primary care centers.  As a doctor he is trying to apply novel research to change the way healthcare is delivered.  It also doesn't help that primary care is severely underfunded despite being the only tier of healthcare that is shown to scale effectively.",1661990550

Neither of the companies I have worked for required some kind of project for employment.

A counterpoint to what you‚Äôre saying is this - candidates won‚Äôt always have access to the kind of time or resources necessary to really create a quality training product. I know at our company, even for simple projects we plan for around 100 person hours of effort for every hour of content we build. To create quality training, we should be doing an adequate needs analysis. We should be doing a task analysis. We should be getting to know the organization and the work environment. We should be creating content that drives performance according to training objectives and allows us test success through some sort of assessment. If we go by the 100:1 ratio, you‚Äôre looking at 8 hours of effort for even 5 minutes of eLearning if you‚Äôre starting from scratch and are looking to build something of quality, and thats assuming you even have the tools to build that content on your personal PC.

I had to restart the game 3 times because of the tyrant fight, the fire extinguisher, and just running out of ammo and healing trying to find my way around the training facility without a guide. So much of the level design didn't make sense and the backtracking also was frustrating. In the prior games at least missing items or items viewed early, it made more sense (obvious exception for REmake Mansion cause booooooy the first time through that felt discombobulated) but after finally beating CV once, I NEVER played it again. 

I was never a die-hard fan of 4 either, never saw what everyone was all so worked up about. The camp and Ashley was kind of annoying...felt like it was made for 16 year old boys. 


OG 3 nemesis is by far the my most loved entry. I played it for hundred of hours, cataloging all the random puzzles and occurrences. That's what made it better than RE2 and what continues to make it better than its REmake (which is still good, just not great) or 2 or 2 REmake. Every play through was a question. It was so rewarding to predict puzzles or get screwed by believing you had the pattern and the RNG messing with your playthrough. RE3 is better than REmake and I love OG REmake.",1661990551

Maybe it was because at the time I was test driving cars I was dailying a Lexus which is smooth like butter.  But the E 450 I felt every little bump in the road.  At that time, I ended up buying a 540 and that was pretty comparable to my Lexus.  Right now I have an M4C and that's not far off from how much of the road I felt when driving the E 450.  But the M4C is a sports car and you're supposed to feel the road.  The E 450 is supposed to be a luxury sedan with a smooth ride.  It's not a smooth ride at all.  

I also felt like the car did not handle the way it should.  I'd never driven a Mercedes before but I was not impressed at all.  The model I was driving had an MSRP of $82k and it felt no better than about what you get from a $32k Accord.  That's not a knock on Honda at all either.  An Accord at that price is a great car.

Outside, there are all kinds of germs even on a ""clean"" footpath. There's also dust and dirt. When you leave your shoes on in the house, you track that all around where you live.

If you can't see the dust and dirt, then... so what? If you can see it, then that's a different issue, because of course you should wipe your feet before coming in.

As for the other two, my usual response is to ask two things:

"awfuleverything","t5_346d4","I'm sorry but I sense an immense amount of abrassive callousness against artists from your comments in this thread and I think we need to calm down a bit here. 

I get that yeah, artists who feel so unique as to immediately feel entitled to invalidate things which may actually have some value can be irritating. But going to the extreme of saying the creative process is not valuable or something people don't care about is very, very clearly wrong. I think we are conflating the ""creative process"" with the ""technical set of steps one can improve to be able to render a nice painting"", which are not at all the same thing. 

Without the creative process none of your favorite pieces of media or art would exist. And I'm not saying this as a ""oh yes, appeasing to the massive egos of artists is a necessary evil so we can convince them to move their lazy asses to create the fun shit we want them to"". I'm saying it as, literally, the creative process IS inherently important. It's what gives purpose, meaning, emotion. It's what's creates the evocative feelings we get, what calls to us and what fuels more creation. 

Is there some kind of sacred and dogmatic methodology by which it can be defined? Obviously not. Tools and technology advance all the damn time and with it so do the artists that use them. There is no singular practice or tool that is so special as to warrant an angry response if replicated digitally. 

But the issue here is that this is not replicating some tool for artists to tighten their work flow and cut time crunches. This is a REPLACEMENT of the entire process altogether, artist included. The amount of steps being skipped is so high that almost all of the creative process gets lost in the ether. 

Now, if all you are aiming for is ""just a pretty landscape"", there is not really much of a moral crime being committed here. An artist doing it manually might actually turn their brain off and start referencing other artists and pictures in a similar fashion until in an automated process they've honed through years of practice. And the results are equally soulless and lacking in originality. 

One can correctly understand there is less ethical stakes at play in a case like that and simultaneously understand the creative process is essential for anything that requires even a smidgen of soul and care more than that‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no ethical stakes at all. 

It‚Äôs still totally understandable for someone who has spent thousands of hours honing a craft to be upset over losing their financial security overnight, and it has nothing to do with narcissistic feelings of specialness or smugness. 

Even in the example of ‚Äúsoulless‚Äù, technical-focused pieces they still have an intent, a creative process and an immense amount of skill attached to them that gets completely lost with the robot replication. It‚Äôs very callous to point and laugh at people who, without exaggeration, dedicate every waking moment of their lives to one singular effort for being upset about this. It‚Äôs a very reasonable thing to get upset about man. How would you feel?",1661990553

"houseplants","t5_2skiq","Hey friend!!

Do you also find it a million times easier to get out of bed and open your curtains for your plants than you do for yourself? Covering my room in greenery has been a game changer for getting chores done honestly, once I water the plants I might as weeeelll pick some clothes off my floor... haha. And I can't show off how nice my plants are if the rest of the room is a sty!

There was a point about a month ago where I was focusing all of my stress into my plants, and without planta reassuring me that they DEFINITELY DIDN'T need more water because I'd only topped them up two days before, I'd have drowned them all for sure. And then there was the week where I kept putting off watering them for no reason... but honestly, they all survived, and I think the mini drought might have even been beneficial for some. We're all back on track now.

I bought the premium version too! It's so nice to be told what to do and when, plus I get a lovely serotonin boost when everything's ticked off. The free version is so good though, I'd never have paid for it if I hadn't loved it so much for the first three months.",1661990553

The XBox itself is only needed when the specific game is not on Xcloud and also if it's PC version does not count for the GP quest or punchcard. Just like your example with ESO and it's monthly GP quest.

As for the MR app for XBox that can be installed on a PC with Windows 10 or later. Only 1 specific version of that app can be installed only on a PC with Windows 10 or newer(iOS users are screwed). That version is 1.1.1.0 which is from 2018. No newer version of it can. The app is quite buggy and old and it's all a matter of time for M$ to exclude their servers to connect to it. We need a newer official less buggy version of that app which can be installed on mobile devices at least. Until then an XBox will be required for these MR points sources more than a PC.

OR, at least M$ adding touch controls when Remote Playing to an XBox. If they really don't want to make a mobile version of the MR app ""for XBox"".",1661990554

Personally when I have had sounds cutting in and out like that its in the connection from my headset to my pc. which is obviously not the case here since I can hear it on the recording. It does sound pretty similar audio wise tho. I'm not saying this is the case, but you could have a faulty soundcard. try reinstalling your drivers for it. if you use an audio interface try reinstalling the drivers for that as well. I would suggest reinstalling the game on a different drive first, and then if that doesn't work, troubleshoot your audio drivers.",1661990555

"sex","t5_2qh3p","People have their various reasons for being attracted to someone younger. Perhaps it's beauty, youth, fertility, energy, emotional baggage, or whatever.

Personally, I don't really pay much attention to someone's age. If I find someone attractive, they could be in their 20s or their 50s for all I care. I'm pretty ambivalent about having kids so being of child-bearing age is not something I think about when looking for a partner. Instead, I look at qualities such as are they fun to be around, do they have a positive outlook in life, do we have similar interests, and does the communication flow naturally.

I do have some trepidation about dating with a big age gap though that mostly has to do with life stages. I'll likely die much sooner, leaving her alone in her later years if she doesn't meet someone else. I also don't want to hold them back from discovering themselves and growing as a person as they mature. I know I'm not the same person now as I was back in my college years vs my 20s vs my 30s.",1661990556
"stocks","t5_2qjfk","Most of the farmland in the world is very poor quality and requires huge amounts of fertilizer to grow a decent crop.  Russia and Ukraine exported lots of fertilizer, but buying from them is now problematic.  Europe has shut down most of it's production due to high energy prices.  China has banned exports of fertilizer to protect their food supply.  Coming up with enough fertilizer to keep the world fed is going to be a huge problem going forward.

Also, I know Deere is working on AI crop management machines that identify which plants need what chemicals and it applies to each plant exactly what it needs.  This has a lot of potential to reduce chemical costs and increase crop yields if it works.",1661990556

My reasons why? I‚Äôm here for the fucking drama, baby. My prediction is that LVP, Garcelle and Sutton actually get along really well together (sad we never got to see these friendships form). I think Brandi is a bit of wild card in terms of her being around LVP, but she‚Äôs entertaining and I would LOVE to see how she interacts with weirdo Dianna. 

Ultimately I want to see LVP (the forever queen of Beverly Hills) knock Dianna off her high horse and belittle her in classic LVP style. And I want Garcelle/ Sutton to be there for it. Brandi is there for the entertainment- She could take Diannas side (LVP, G and S can handle it)‚Ä¶ But she could also totally hate Dianna, which would be hilarious!

"CampingGear","t5_2tru8","OK I wasn't fishing but walking coastally in the UK during a heatwave...which then turned to rain...then winds...then cold at night...for 20 days.

So, I'd always say take wet weather gear - I mean a goretex light jacket and maybe breathable trousers can pack light... and a warmer layer/baselayers if you can, it might get a lot colder/wetter than you expect unless you totally know it stays hot/humid etc even at night. And it's only 3 days, so forecasts are probably right, but things can change.

Also any medications. This tripped me up cos the sunburn inflamed my eczema and my usual 'take antihistamines' trick stopped working on the 20th day when I ran out of my usual brand... so left early to go home and slather myself with steroidal cream and stay in the dark - which worked btw...so yeah. Also had suncream but no aftersun, big mistake as the aftersun I found locally, like the anti-histamines didn't seem to work that well?

And socks. You can never have too many socks. Always polyester/polycotton, never cotton/wool, they'll stay wet, ditto all other clothes. I took four polyester or mix tshirts and did use them as extra layers when it got cold at night! Usually good to take multiple layers you can shed or have one drying and wear the other, rather than one big one that might get drenched/dirty.

So yes, the 'pack light' thing is good, but there can be some 'false economies' with that as I am still finding out...",1661990558

"WitchesVsPatriarchy","t5_p3r73","I think the general trend of viewing things as extremely black or white, and the general loss of nuance in public discourse, is fueled by emotional responses more than by critical thinking. I'm sorry that I wasn't more clear with my wording, as I was certainly not trying to discredit your opinion. 

Jewish people are not a single entity and they are bound to have differing opinions just like everyone else. It does not surprise me that there are people on both sides of that argument. We cannot know what goes on in her head, we can only have opinions. The hard facts are that she has openly and for several decades stated that there are Nazi analogies and traits in the Death Eaters and the language they use (like mudbloods and purebloods), and that Voldemort's character was based in part on Hitler. She was widely praised by many Jewish organizations in the early 2000s because of it. 

Furthermore, goblins have been depicted in the same fashion in many works spanning centuries, including luminaries like Tolkien. It's entirely possible that the propaganda depictions of Jewish people drew on the descriptions of goblins that already existed in folklore from Europe and the UK. 

I personally think the easily rebutted antisemitism argument, and other accusations of racism within the world of HP, weaken the stance of people who rightfully call her out for her TERF bs. 

I personally don't give a rats ass if she keeps getting money and exposure from other people, as long as she keeps getting shut down by people each time she opens her mouth. Getting more money is not going to have an impact on her quality of life, she already has enough that getting more will not change her daily life at all. Getting less attention personally (as in, attention paid to JKR specifically, as opposed to attention paid to HP) will definitely impact her. The general public already knows that she is reprehensible, and she is no longer the universally beloved public figure that she once was. That is the way to get to her. 

Getting rid of the art that is beloved by so many people would magnify the effects of her shitty beliefs. Many, many, many artists in history have been terrible people, but we still study them and display their works and allow the art to inspire us. This is not different than enjoying a Picasso. You don't tell a six year old that the art is beautiful but the man who made it was a philandering abuser.

"NeverHaveIEverShow","t5_2lu937","I think it's tricky territory when we say, x had a bad/lonely/lacking childhood so it makes sense why they are like this.

While it's true that our childhood has a huge influence on our growth at some point we have to take responsibility for our trauma and sort that out ourselves rather than take it out on others. That's why Devi sees a therapist and we expect her to grow because unfortunately, nothing can bring her dad back. All of the scenes where ""Crazy Devi"" comes out are portrayed in the sense that Devi must grow from them rather than providing a sympathetic lens to her actions. 

I believe Ben gets a different treatment, partially because even though we see his jerk side a lot, it's played off for laughs and he isn't the main character. I wonder why Ben isn't in therapy and think it would be really helpful for him. We see how interacting with Paxton and getting that time to bond and help someone else helps Ben.

There's also individual constitution. For example we can't assume that everyone with Ben's childhood would turn out to be like him. I had a similar childhood as well, but have never really acted like him.

It also doesn't mean that those who come from ""better"" childhoods can resolve conflicts and grow that quickly. What it relies on is the person's willingness and humility to see that no matter what they've been through, there may be a better way to live in the world than what they've been doing. And to find out what that is. 

It's unfair that we're all dealt different hands in life, but ultimately, the responsibility to grow and form healthy relationships is on us.",1661990559

I strongly believe there is a need for the agent model like you see with top athletes/stars for tier1 business execs. But other than some star headhunters that work for very specific niches, I haven't encountered the same model to more traditional lines of business.

So Tldr; start talking to people in your network about interest of moving on and see if interesting people pop up, then setup some casual conversations where you can openly discuss about your work experience and your future interests. If there is a match you can take it from there.",1661990561

"FapDeciders","t5_2t08y","Apologies for the late reply, real world stuff gets me super busy sometimes ü´§ I made some little notes though so I wouldn‚Äôt forget things.

My first piss shower was not enjoyable ü§£I was focused on trying to fuck myself with the bottles as well as not die from slipping, falling and impaling myself on one of said bottlesü§£! 

I‚Äôd set myself up so I was squatting over one of the larger bottles that I had to fuck myself with. The bottle was sat on top of the shower bench I have, and I was trying to work it into my hole as deep as I could. That‚Äôs when I had the thought, that was the best time to grab the Tupperware full of piss. So I grabbed it and went to dump it over my tits. When the first bit hit my skin, I basically jumped out of my own skin and the bottle I‚Äôd been fucking my hole with fell out and clattered to the floor. I hadn‚Äôt even considered the piss was going to be ice fucking cold by then, so the temperature completely shocked me. Piss is supposed to be warm and it was even colder on my warm skin, from squatting over and pumping my hole full of bottles at that point. 

I recovered the bottle that fell, repositioned myself to begin fucking, sitting down on, and stretching my cunt on it and started pouring the cold piss on my tits again. It was just as cold and off putting the second time, but at least it didn‚Äôt catch me off guard. I felt disgusting and started calling myself a stupid dirty pisswhore as I dumped little by little more all over my tits and stomach occasionally stopping to rub it in for good measure. When I was finished, I noticed the bottle had wedged its way in a little deeper and I was feeling that stretch and slight burning/tingle sensation which made me even wetter, which then let the bottle stretch me just a bit farther, sink in just a bit deeper. Which definitely made me feel even more disgusting and ashamed. I finished fucking and stretching myself with the rest of the bottles before I had to them clean the shower again.

Then I started sudsing up my boobs with body wash again (I did have to use a tiny bit of water to make it lather, but I was sure not to spray myself with water to wash off the piss), to clean the shower again. I started cleaning the shower in the same manner I had previously, using my boobs to clean the walls and floor especially well (as well as is possible ü§£). Once I did the best I could using my boobs I pulled the brush handle back out and gave the floor and walls a good once over. I then rinsed off the whole shower and then finally turned the water on myself.",1661990561

 To be clear I do mean hire the old team leads from Halo 3 back into their old position either by replacing the current leads or creating a new division of 343i dedicated to traditional titles. Most of the old team leads from Halo 3 are actually available.

 Edit: what's funny is this comment is neither toxic or untrue and I'm being downvoted for wanting at least one more title made by the original creators of the franchise.

 Some of you may not realize it, but the team who created the Halo Universe, made it breath, and gave it life are all getting old. We live in a period of time were every single one of lead team members are freed up from projects and there's really no telling when that could change. There might not be another opportunity.

The main goal of this game is not exploration (3 is excellent for exploration, NV is just okay for it) but to solve quests in strategic ways besides pure combat. Lots of stuff does change long term from your quest choices, and you can't see everything in 1 playthrough. If you want to give it another try, try building more of a character from the beginning, specialize in a specific weapon type, and try to work your way into specific factions before deciding to side with them or fight them.",1661990562

You believe the in game ping only shows you the latency from the game server to the exit node and ignores the latency from the exit node to the PC. However, how can the exit node send a reply on its own without going to the users PC? And if it reaches the users PC, then wouldn't the in game ping ALSO show the latency from the node to the PC. Maybe I'm wrong, and that's why I am asking for clarification.  
  
Also I tested this by pinging a server in Tokyo and got an average latency of 184ms (I am in the US). I then did a second ping using a VPN server located in Tokyo and got 175ms. Yes, its lower, but if ICMP is going from the game server to the end node, shouldn't it be MUCH lower than this? Teach me please :)",1661990563

Also don't get facied by the DDR5 to much. It's not really faster than DDR4 per se. Because the cost to performance ratio so high that to see a real improvement over normal ddr 4 3200mhz you need to go 6000mhz and above 

And also even if you go DDR5 it's not like your future proofing either why cause it's a laptop

I will explain why.
These are the first iterations of the DDR5 rams and are still not mature enough. What I mean by that is the cpu memory controls are not gonna change since the cpu is the same and unlike a desktop laptops don't have support for docp or xmp to go beyond the limitation of stock memory limits example below i have put the link for 12700h , if you scroll down you can cat h the supported memory frequencies for ddr4 and ddr5
https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/132228/intel-core-i712700h-processor-24m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz.html


Maybe in the future better ddr5 ram with better lantecies and frequency will come but you won't get it. Cause laptop memory controllers are limited. So you won't be able to reap the benefits of newer ddr5 tech anyway.

Let's look at out past. When ddr4 was thing intel upto almost 9-10th gen didn't support ram frequency more than 2666mhz for their laptops . So even though DDR4 3200mhz became available later it's not like you can put it in your old laptop and make it run at 3200mhz . Similarly for ddr5 as well. Since DDR5 in itself is immature right now you cannot maybe put the new ddr5 which might come out later which have faster frequencies and lower latencies. By you can not put i mean you can run the rams at the speed of what the future might offer you.



PS I am not discouraging you from buying DDR5 but just informing you how things work that names of things alone is not the whole story.

I would urge you to still buy the legion 5i 2022 it already has been reviewed by Jarod.",1661990563

Now, after all of this with Trump and it going on for years and so many so-called good people turning into little fascists overnight, I no longer make that mistake. Claiming to be of any faith or religion has absolutely nothing to do with how good of a person you are. Nothing.

They wanted a way to show ""a skilled player can handle this boss by using strategy, but a less skilled player can just get to the highest level by grinding and brute force the boss"". This would imply these experience systems were created to make the game more casual, which makes sense to me, but take it with a grain of salt.

"betterCallSaul","t5_2u05j","I would argue many of these actually are key characters as well or weren't actually that important.

If it weren't for Hank and the ride-along Walt doesn't start cooking. So yes, Hank is central to Walt's descent, I think that's fine to say.

Jesse, obviously key. They were partners after all.

Badger is more dispensable, if he didn't get arrested Skinny Pete or Combo (he was still alive, right), or someone else. Eventually they would have worked their way back to Saul, because that's who Jesse wanted.

The remaining people are all people that were found through Saul. And I would argue people are understating how difficult it would be for Walt to get an intro to Gus. Gus is extremely careful and doesn't want to work with Walt the loose cannon at all. He finds Walt's product because Saul makes the call. Even then, he doesn't plan to work with Walt, it's Gale who convinced him after seeing how pure the meth was.

If Gus simply gets word that this is a rival dealer cutting into his territory, he doesn't probably even get a sample to Gale, he probably just kills Walt. He doesn't care about the quality of the product. He cares about revenge on the cartel.",1661990565

I did take it apart and add some distilled water at year 8 since it was starting to have more cavitation noise but that‚Äôs about it. Was in my main system too which I kept running awake 24/7 to do server functions stuff as well.

Now obviously it‚Äôs pretty hard for a hunk of metal to fail but due to the use of both aluminum and copper in heatsinks sometimes you do see corrosion over time and heatpipes can fail due to that.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","There really should be no correlation between number of cards/total credit and how much you spend. You need to treat the credit card as cash and set a budget. Cutting up cards is a drastic solution to that problem, and it doesn't fix the core problem, which is discipline and impulse control.

Personally, I never spend more than I have cash on hand. So I could always pay off all my cards immediately if needed. I don't use credit cards for emergencies, I only use them for rewards points and opportunities (i.e. might as well let my savings grow another month).

There are a bunch of strategies that can help, such as:

- envelope method - instead of literal envelopes with cash, you can use credit cards for each category and track spending that way
- use it as a debit card - pay off your balance every day, week, whatever
- track spending in a spreadsheet or something like YNAB and review it constantly (e.g. every week) until you get into a rhythm

Or you can go cold turkey for a while and just use debit/cash, but then you're forgoing certain protections you get with credit.

The important thing is to establish and follow a budget. How credit cards are involved isn't important, they're just a tool you can use in executing the plan. Cancel anything that has an annual fee and decide about the others. You should probably keep at least three, ideally the oldest ones, but the rest you could close if they don't fit with your plan.",1661990565

My local rock station had interesting evening programs when the commercial jockeys had gone home. The late shows had people doing them that were very enthusiastic about their kind of music, and would talk about the bands/songs inbetween playing them. 

You could often catch radio plays too on the 'old people' stations, some of which could be pretty interesting.

As a kid then just by going outside and trying to find other kids to hang out with, or maybe look for a stick and whittle it into a sword. Those got bashed up pretty quickly during fights, so they were always in demand. I actually moved into suburbia again for the first time since I was as child last spring, and was surprised that I have not seen a single kid outside playing in the months since.",1661990566

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I agree generally about ending factory farming or turning vegan being a more impactful step from an environmental perspective, both because of the massive amount of emissions associated with factory farming and because in general, ceasing to purchase a manufactured product has less environmental impact than purchasing a manufactured product. I don't think that 80% figure is correct--here's an EPA source on the subject (https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data) which has agriculture/forestry at 24%, electricity generation at 25%, industry at 21%, and transportation at 14%. 

There are complicating economic factors here when you consider the impact an individual consumer can have, though. If I choose to stop buying meat today, the meat supply will not change to reflect the incrementally decreased demand for at least another year, just due to the life cycle of a farm. And when the reduced demand does hit, the cost will likely decrease, which will drive more demand from other consumers. The emissions caused by this industry will only decrease when ranchers cull their herds down to a smaller size. Compare that to an EV--if I buy an EV, it drives apparent demand for EVs, which drives increased production of EVs (and, certainly, increased purchase price to some extent). It also drives demand for technologies supporting electric vehicles, including home and distributed solar power and battery recycling. And some of that can take chunks out of not just the 14% associated with transportation, but also the 25% associated with electricity generation.

Personally, I drive an electric car, my house has solar power, and I try to purchase meat, eggs, and cheese from small local farms since my economic circumstances allow it. There are lots of things we can do on a per consumer basis in addition to going vegan and/or buying an EV. And truthfully, nothing we do individually is as impactful as voting for policies that reduce the 21% and the 25%.

Thanks for the delta--it's good to have a nuanced discussion about this!",1661990566

Pushing in the ""+"" direction at any point along the page marks a spot where the carriage will stop when the TAB key is pressed, while pressing in the ""-"" direction can remove a marker. When all markers are removed using the ""-"" key, pressing TAB should allow the carriage to slide all the way to the right margin of the page.

P.  2‚Äì9. Removal of a Flag

b. Rules for removing a Flag are as follows:
(1) Charges, restraint, confinement, court-martial, nonjudicial punishment and absent without leave (including alcoholrelatedincidents). RemovetheFlagwhentheSoldierisacquittedatcourt-martialorciviliantrialandnoother adverse action arising from the incident or charges is contemplated; when UCMJ action is closed or dropped without action; or when punishment from court-martial, civilian trial, or nonjudicial punishment is completed. If a court- martial has adjudged a punitive discharge, the individual will remain flagged until the conviction is final in accordance with Rule for Courts-Martial 1209, Manual for Courts-Martial. If there is a suspension of punishment (for example, under UCMJ, ART 15) or the imposition of probation or parole (usually for civilian misconduct), that individual will remain flagged until the suspension, probationary, or parole period is over. This does not include suspension of a driver‚Äôs license. If the duration of punishment, suspension, probation, or parole is over 1 month, the unit should con- sider if the adverse action Flag should be converted to a transferable ‚ÄùPunishment Phase‚Äù Flag, if appropriate. In this case, the ‚ÄúAdverse Action‚Äù Flag is lifted the same date the ‚ÄúPunishment Phase‚Äù Flag is initiated. If the Soldier receives punishment and subsequently appeals, the Flag will be removed when punishment is complete; the Soldier will only remain flagged if the appeal puts the punishment on hold or suspension until either the adverse action is revoked or the punishment is complete.



When the flag is removed the solider is put back on the promotion standings unless otherwise directed.",1661990566

I saw some people say that in chronicle mode you only play against the previous teams with no story whatsoever. I refuse to believe that because that basically would be a competition route. Why name it ""chronicle mode"" and make a big deal of it when it's only a competition route, a feature we had in every previous game. \\

I think in chronicle mode you play through some parts of the story of the previous games + ares and orion.

And in one of the new screenshots that they posted on Inazuma Day you can see Unmei at Raimon from Ares which kinda confirm this idea, because the story isnt set in Raimon ( there is also a possibility that in the main story you can simply go to raimon and this screenshot isnt related to the chronicle mode)

And at the topic of DLC I can see them make one or two, but i think there will be game exclusive story expansion something like IE2 / CS where you go around Japan / time and space to form the best team there is or a FFI with the game original characters.",1661990566

"space","t5_2qh87","I‚Äôve done some rudimentary forms of this and one problem that I have is that it uses the left to right, up to down scanning because that‚Äôs how most of these basic tools are programmed to search through the image. In general this makes very intense sounds depending on how you encode the bits to match up to each other.

It‚Äôs a cool process, but generally doesn‚Äôt make things that are very musical and mostly would give literally no context to blind people or anyone that could directly benefit from such a thing. Although we are decades away from being able to do something like that, I feel like there is a way to more directly convey the difference between this image and a slightly different nebula image.

I‚Äôd love to try and work a way to algorithmically explain  these images into sound. I don‚Äôt know how you would really decide anything like this, but you‚Äôd definitely want to take in the whole image at once, find tones/intensities and styles and assign them to different bands.

Even using polar coordinates from the center pixel would likely produce a more wholistic, slightly more musical song than just using a standard array order.

This is working pretty well in comparison to most others I‚Äôve seen though, seems like they put the whole thing on a midi track and used a good bit of artistic liberty to make this.

I can play one game of Pickleball in 20 minutes and hit the ball a 100 times. To me it‚Äôs an ROI on fun. In 20 minutes I actually have more fun than 4 hours of golf. It‚Äôs much cheaper. I am near the people I play with, not off the fairway by myself.

They are pretty good at capturing your composition any moment in time, with relative accuracy - to within like... a medical tolerance. 

Bodybuilders try to use them to measure progress, and they are not really accurate enough to do that.

For example, a doctor never needs to know if you're 9% bodyfat or 12%. Or if your lean mass is 175 vs 179. 

Dexa is really made, first and foremost, for measuring bone density - everything else (fat vs lean vs water) is a value-add feature",1661990567

The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorne. Once people get used to reading old versions of language easily (also Dickens, Shakespeare, etc), this is really an edge-of-your-seat, intense story that is disturbing, emotional, exciting, and transcends time.

Ethan Frome, Wharton.  A novella, very intense. My favorite book.

""A Model of Christian Charity"", Winthrop. It's one of the oldest documents in American lit, and more like a sermon.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I totally agree. I would, however, also like to point out that sometimes having ultra-large families can make things easier for some of the children, usually, middle children, as sometimes having the complete, undivided attention of some Mormon parents can sometimes be very harmful to the child. 

My mother had 7 children; a third of the size of the above-mentioned family. My step-father, the man who was present through most of my childhood, is a devout Mormon and psychologist. Not only is he aware of the mind games and potential emotional/psychological damage of TSCC's practices, but he also used what he knew to ""enhance"" his implementation of those practices. 

When I was younger, I used to console my pain with the fact that we were smarter than him. Not that we knew more, but we quite easily identified his schemes and often turned them against him. 

Unfortunately, his frustrations were released in a more physical nature. I have also come to realize that, it doesn't matter how ""smart"" you are, or how strong your will to resist, living with that for so many of your formative years is incredibly damaging.

As each of us reached the age of adulthood, we were quickly removed from the picture, the mind games on full display for anyone willing to look (TSCC is against looking when a priesthood holder is involved), and the next child in line became the focus. We were the shield for our younger siblings. Our time at the center of his focus allowed them to experience a small semblance of actual childhood. At least, that is what I tell myself and ardently hope is the case.

Sorry, I find I have much more emotional baggage than I'd like to believe.",1661990569

When I sit down in the evening on my comfy sofa and relax in front of the tv I want one device with immediate access to everything at my finger tips. Do I want to pull my phone out of my pocket, unlock it, open home assistant, wait for it to load, swipe to the correct view, scroll to the function I need and select it to play my ps5? Or do I want a customized interface on a remote that has every media function I need at the ready? Along with custom routines centered around media playback like setting my lights to a low brightness when I pause a movie and turning them off when I hit play. 


I personally don‚Äôt want to drag a remote around my house to control my smart home but when I sit down to relax I want a device custom designed to allow me to control everything with the least amount of friction.

"buildapcsales","t5_2s3dh","Be mindful of recent listings of in-demand products from suspicious third-party sellers on marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, Google, Newegg, and Walmart. These ""deals"" have a high likelihood of not shipping; you should do your due diligence to ensure you do not get scammed. 

* Use common sense - if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.
* Check seller profiles for signs that the sale may be fraudulent. 
    * The seller is new or has few reviews. 
    * The seller has largely negative reviews (on Amazon, sellers can remove negative reviews from their ratings- viewing seller profiles allows you to see these complaints) 
    * The seller has a recently reactivated account (likely their account was hacked and is now being used fraudulently). 

If you suspect a deal is fraudulent, please report the post. Moderators can take action based on these reports. We encourage leaving a comment to warn others. 

Amazon and eBay generally have good buyer protection. If you choose to purchase from a third-party seller through their platforms and run into issues, it should be easy to get your money back promptly. You may have more difficulties with Newegg or Walmart.

Otherwise, the only thing that really sticks for me out in your routine is how long you plop for. Everyone‚Äôs hair is different but for me, if I let my hair dry too much while in a towel/tshirt, it ends up looking pretty similar. I lose definition and it musses up my fairly delicate curl pattern. 

I usually micro-plop (gently blot with a hair towel made of tshirt material) so it‚Äôs not dripping, apply products, and either arrange/style and diffuse, or wet plop (15-20 minutes) until I can style and dry.

I have came later than 1:30, if I explain to my boss that I had an appointment or can't be there at that time he understands. Prep time is a break. The most you are doing is printing worksheets for class. Every time I get a new class (3 months) I know exactly the worksheets needed and print them all in a day, which means I don't have to print or plan anything for the next 3 months.   
We have our own classrooms and all of the ten minute breaks are spent in the teachers break room, chatting, eating  snacks,  and drinking coffee/tea that our boss provides for us.

"whatsthissnake","t5_2xtic","Common Gartersnakes *Thamnophis sirtalis* are small (&lt;90 cm, record 137.2 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in disturbed habitats like urban and suburban yards. They are commonly encountered generalist snakes across much of the North American continent and eat small invertebrates, fish, amphibians and mammals.
Western populations are a model organism for an elegant case study in evolutionary arms races, [Tetrodotoxin Resistance](http://snakesarelong.blogspot.com/2014/07/tetrodotoxin-resistant-snakes.html).

*Thamnophis* gartersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They can deliver a weak venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are [not considered medically significant to humans](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/).

One of the widest-ranging snakes in North America, this species complex is almost certainly harboring unrecognized diversity and shows strong population structure at major biogeographic barriers (ie Mississippi River embayment and Peninsular Florida).

This genus is in need of revision using modern molecular methods.

There's a great discussion to be had about *inequality* from hypothetical future AI revolution, but there will always be jobs. The more sophisticated AI gets, the *more* it makes sense to pay humans low wages on simpler tasks

See: comparative advantage in trade. America could make everything it wants, but unless resources are literally unlimited (not possible unless you break space-time) it will always make sense to have people specialize and trade. If AI can do *everything*, that means it can do super-lucrative Asteroid mining or whatever. And computing time/resources will be limited, so people will want AI doing as much of the most valuable asteroid mining as physically possible. It wouldn't make sense in that world to waste AI resources on cleaning rich people's yachts, so humans would probably do that for dogshit wages

(hence the need to address inequality, since we probably don't want 90% of people forced to do yacht cleaning and barely survive)",1661990573

The important thing though is if you feel it. If the label bisexual feels good and right to you then congratulations, you're bisexual. If it doesn't feel right, you might want to try different labels, like pansexual, omnisexual or queer. If labeling yourself at all feels wrong, you don't have to. And if you later realise you're straight or gay after all, that's great too! Whatever it's gonna be, it's all great, as long as it feels right to you. 

There's no rush, take your time! Try some labels, try how you feel thinking about yourself being bisexual. Read about it, do the quizzes (though many shouldn't be taken too seriously), watch videos, test the waters. It took me a few months to be sure I'm bisexual, some need even years.",1661990573

Yall the ones bitching upset online, I'm just telling you how its prolly gonna go and how its out of step with gaming in general.  Not sure what yall expect after how totems went.  If you wanna get mad at me for bringing the reality check, its misdirected.  Every single downvote just shows you're mad.

&amp;nbsp;

It's like trying to explain microtransaction pricing to people.  They get mad at you when you're just telling them why it is the way it is.  As mentioned I have limited time friends too.  Limited time people are not a monolith in how they feel and think.

&amp;nbsp;

You can be mad, you can try to inflate numbers unrealistically to twist the truth, you can have your opinion.  But it's very very unlikely to change for the reasons given.  If they wanted you to get all the totems cards or duffel cards in ~10 hours like your change would provide they would have designed it that way.  But they didn't.  And they designed it in a different way for very good industry supported reasons.",1661990575

Very good with his back to goal and turning, not easy to dispossess, and he is dangerous with his pace and strength on the counter as well. From what I saw he is capable of intelligent movement in the box. Doesn't seem to have the quick feet and skill of a winger although he hits good crosses. Also takes corners for them and is a creative and accurate passer.

With all that being said I can also see why no big clubs have bid for him. Not technical enough to be a winger and hasn't got much experience as a lone striker. Definitely needs work on his aerial ability, it's not something he was asked to do often and he doesn't look natural in the air either. For 30M I do think he's worth it but I'm glad we didn't pay 40-50 earlier in the window. Our system seems to work more toward his strengths; obviously it doesn't hurt that Rangnick wanted him if they weren't able to get Antony.

Anarchist normaly surges when the people decides to finally attack the root the problem instead of putting plasters to the problem, which are the wealth inequality, the lack of true representation in our political system and the injust distribution of power. Fascism is when the powerfull use racial and all types of xenofobe lingo to convice the people that this problems are not because the things I have mentioned before, but because the ""other"", dividing us and making us fight between each other, maintaining the status quo or worse, make it stronguer.

 I don't think I've ever had the pain scale described to me as anything but relative, both in the ER/ED or during a normal appointment. Or at least, that was the impression I'm always given.


I can see why some people would be confused, tho. Wording like ""10 = worst pain possible"" is very vague, even tho the rest of the scale seems to have good explanations. It seems that some other scale explanations do a better job tho.


Do you have any advice for getting a the best pain evaluation possible? Information I should be keeping track of, other things to consider? I would appreciate it; I'd very much like to try to get SSI.",1661990577

Regardless of whether you‚Äôre straight, bisexual, homosexual, asexual, etc. we have preferences for a particular type of partner and relationship, and to navigate the social quagmire that is dating, we present and engage with specific behaviours and within specific social groups. These behaviours reflect gender roles. 

If I am looking for a gay male partner, it‚Äôs going to be different than heterosexual man looking for a female partner. Or a woman looking for a male partner. Or a woman looking for a female partner.

The confusion that exists today is in large part due to the breaking down of traditional gender roles of yesterday, either through higher female involvement in the workforce, the ability to connect with people outside of traditional environments, or through the acceptance of less traditional forms of sexual partnerships and masculine/feminine behaviour. 

But, at the end of the day, my sexual preference and desire for a gay man will still drive some level gendered behaviour. I will still want, or expect my partner to present some level of gendered behaviour. So we adopt roles to help signal our interest.",1661990577

The different screen faces can be handy when looking at your different parameters of your day. Such as time, daily step goal, monthly step goal, etc. the ‚Äúfind phone‚Äù feature is handy as well. 

The phone pairing has been seamless for me. 

Personally, I LOVE the running feature it uses sensors in your phone and the watch to create splits, time elapsed, miles ran, etc. If you are looking for a fitness watch for weightlifting this probably isn‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs mainly for running. I compare it to a Fitbit but TOUGH. 

the other programmable features are nice of doing things like interval runs/sprints. 

The app is pretty bare bones, but functional allows you to set step goals for the day, week, month. It also allows you to set activity hours , mileage goals, and work out plans. 

I think the notifications on the watch are pretty pointless because you have to navigate through several screens to get to it. So at that point you might as well pull your phone out.",1661990577

My younger three sons are the same age range as my brothers' kids.

My kids are 12 and 10 year old twins and their cousins are 11 year old twins and 9.

They were raised very close and did everything together until my eldest started pulling back last year. It started with declining to hang out with his cousins and brothers in lieu of hanging out with his own friends. They still get along and are inseparable at family gatherings.

The big problem started when the 11yo twins tried hanging out with my 12yo and the friends he made last year in middle school. My 12yo pretty much told them to hang out with other people. 

My brother and his wife were furious. They think my 12yo is just being a dickweed. No, it's because he and his friends have conversations that he doesn't want to have with his cousins. There's a bit of a emotional difference between a 7th grader and a 6tu grader. 

My 12yo is doing and thinking about things that the 11yos are not...yet. It's just uncool to hangout with 6th graders too. I'm sure it will change or everyone will adapt. Plus boys don't hold grudges.

I told all that to my brother and his wife and they weren't sold on it. They demanded that I talk to my son and have a family meeting. 

Instead I talk to the counselor. That pissed them off more and they accused me of being lazy. This was not a family issue. This was a school issue. 

The boys are okay with each other and even got M&amp;Ms from the counselor. Yes, my son could have been nicer but he's 12 and they're not nice at that age.

"90DayFiance","t5_34i5y","I never said Pedro was scammer, I have always thought Pedro loved her, until he didn't, and then he was a complete asshole and acting suspicious.  For some reason you excuse his behavior, but expect Chantel to act like Jesus, and turn the other cheek. Probably because you think boys will be boys and women should know their place. 

My opinions about Pedro have nothing to do with being a xenophobe, so eat shit.  When we applied for my husband's change of status to get his permanent residence, and I say **WE,** not because I own him now, or he owes me, but because it required both of us to do a shit load of paperwork.  We have forms and documents that got totally intermingled:  years of taxes, W2s, Lawyer correspondence, applications, birth certificates, documentation about our parents even though we're in our 50s and 60s, previous divorces, photos and mementos, all for both of us.  If we decided to split guess who would be in charge of sorting all that crap!  You obviously have not been through the immigration process.  

And guess what!  My immigrant husband and his family would never treat me the way Pedro and his family have treated Chantel.  Why?  Because they are not assholes.  Likewise, my family has always treated my husband with respect.  Why?  Because we are not assholes.  Whether immigrant or not, some people are just assholes. 

So get off your high fucking horse.   P.S.  You keep going back to the bank account, like Pedro doesn't have a personal account, and like he is not going to get any money back he rightfully is owed. Once he filed for divorce he didn't  have access to those funds any way, and if Chantel were to spend any of that money or try to hide it in some way, she would be in deep shit.",1661990578

I think,in order to make this guy interesting he has to do something that is not typical for him. For example, either fucks up a job and gets persecuted for it, or do something nice to another person that is in complete contrast with his natural asshole behaviour. You can mash both things together to make more intriguing story, but first you should know will this supposed to be a drama or a comedy, and build up the following situations accordingly. Both ways people will relate to him, in the first case, because he's on fire, and the second because he's not actually the asshole he appears to be. If you put those together it will become even more engaging. 

Back on topic, there are all kinds of assholes out there, some are smart and some are not. The smart ones usually are very selfish and confident and threat people like shit , very picky on any subject, high on microagression, but usually not really into open conflict. The not so smart assholes are also mostly self driven but are more openly agressive and can burst into a phisical fight over insignificant things. Mind that both types can be alcoholics, and alcohol works differently according to their personality. 
I hope this helps.",1661990578

They also didn't tell us when my grandpa died and we weren't invited to the funeral or my aunt's wedding. It's really weird and hush hush and toxic so I've never known what to make of it.

"monarchism","t5_2s6v1","It appears many here are referring only to Italian Fascism, National Socialism, even if it isn't fascism, but inspired and USSR (and to a degree Warsaw countrys) style communism. 
There is one thing to note, and that is that both fascism and communism worked very differently in their ways in other countries. 
If you are to put Brazilian fascism near Italian fascism (post Hitler) you'd notice a lot of differences, same would go with other versions of fascism with each other. Some where the focus is just the people in general, some the country and some the world with very different views on race and racism, religion and political agendas.
Same goes for communism where we can easily see the difference between Stalin's USSR, Mao's China and Pol Pot Cambodia, where all 3 follow communism (their own version) they had very different views.

Difficult question but if we go by ""What would be better for monarchist/monarchs/monarchies"" then the safest answer is fascism since as we had seen, and can still see many had a favourable view of their country monarchy and kept it or just left royals to themselves unlike what happened with communism.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","This is fascinating to me, because it happens to my SO all the time and I don't understand how I'm doing it!!

Firstly, there is not really anything I can say to prove my intentions here are genuine and that I'm not *trying* to derail or dismiss. All I can say is I don't mean to and its exactly why I asked more questions about it. 

Secondly, things that seem obvious to you are clear as mud to me. It definitely NOT clear to me what OC is talking about and I genuinely didn't know if his complaint applied to my example situation. I asked for an example to help me understand but I didn't get one (in hindsight I probably should have waited longer) so I gave one of my own. 

My SO and I have already worked through this particular issue, so I hoped it would be less.... Usey? 

Third, final point: I rephrase things that I am struggling to understand. The idea is that I rephrase in my own words so that the other person can comfirm if I have understood or if we need to talk more. As an example if you say ""i dont like it when you wolf whistle me"" i might say ""so wolf whistles make you uncomfortable?"" its not a good example because the original statement is pretty clear and rephrasing its not needed, but I hope it makes sense. 

Unfortunately, I found out from SO that he finds this to be incredibly rude, so I try not to do it. However, sometimes that leaves me a bit lost because I can't be certain if Ive understood some things. 

Yeah some of your comment was harsh, but like I said its more fascinating than mean because I invited this discussion.",1661990580

"AskPhotography","t5_2t96o","&gt;I was wondering what lens to go for

How much of a closer view do you want?

&gt;(does the f-stop number matter for the desired images)?

Yes. The aperture one of your basic exposure variables. It also affects depth of field and sharpness. It definitely matters what you set that to.

But the f-number in the lens name is just the maximum available aperture, not necessarily what it's set to for a particular photo. And you probably want to use a narrower aperture for the photos you you have in mind, so having an f/2.8 maximum isn't strictly necessary over an f/4 maximum.

But a wider maximum aperture also tends to correlate with a better quality lens in general. So even though you don't need f/2.8, I would expect that the f/2.8 lens has better overall image quality than the f/4-5.6 lens.

&gt;I am also wondering whether it is worth me upgrading the body to something that is 24MP to achieve the images due to the scale of the fabric print

I don't think so because that isn't a very big increase in resolution, and finer details are likely to be lost in the texture of the fabric medium anyway.",1661990582

And yeah the evidence that those scenes must be tied together is because of his outfit. Hmm so it would be the 3rd episode. It's possible yeah. 

She does want to spend time with him and she would if she wasn't a superhero leading a revived classic superhero team but she's shown to put JSA stuff above other stuff like last Season in which she went full focus on Shade and Eclipso until they crossed paths again during 2x05 but afterwards she again answered the call to go see what was up at school. (Eclipso taking over Mr. Deisinger) So it's why I'm still wondering how that story will appear and become relevant. We've seen Cameron in the previews still struggling with the cramps from his powers (kind of confirms my beliefs that he's half-human and half-whatever-the-Mahkents-are) at school so not ruling out that she could notice it. 

Or it all comes together: worried because she sees him clutching his wrists at school + later at the Pit Stop Beth shows them she's found a new suspect and it traces somehow to Cameron + Courtney opts to ask him if it's all ok and he can trust in her and tada, ice powers reveal scene. Albeit no that he's the murderer, yet at least.

I remember those pictures but the breakdown of the first link is interesting if that is how things go. I'm imagining Rick shooting Cameron a lot of glares if that's what happens. And also wasn't aware that the scene where he is powering up as Hourman can be related as well to the same episode. TBH I didn't even consider back then that the picture of Courtney sitting in that place was related to being near Cameron's house, because I was like ""nah"" and kind of look like a non-Stargirl thing and more like a photshoot session but it might be true after all.

I'm curious why Cameron would be in the set of Beth's house.

but he told me that my rectal prolapse is not severe at all and that i don't need a surgery and a surgery might make things worse (i think he meant that surgery might ruin my sphincter or something like that but i'm not sure)
he also helped me heal my old anal fissures which is not a problem now
when he first told me to take mebeverine i took it 
and they day right after i took that capsule everything was so good, it felt like heaven and i thought that i'm done with this problem, but after one week everything started to become as how it was, i called him and he told me that we can do nothing because it got worse because of stress and that i need to try not stressing myself 
if you have anything else that would help please let me know

Her demeanor was casual and relaxed, but her attire could at least hint of a higher tier of birth. She was in spring colors, wearing a light dress of eggshell blue with her chestnut hair tidied into a crown braid and embedded with a rose.

Cersei was not necessarily seeking drunkenness, but neither could she refuse to share a single drink with every face she met. Already a bit tipsy herself, she found the lesser lords of the realm far ahead of her. A table full of men hedging bets on how many drinks they could down in a short amount of time. Foolish behavior, but it was fit for the occasion - and she was impressed to see someone actually *win* such a competition.

""I've never seen a man drink so much so fast,"" she remarked as she approached the rowdy table. ""How much do you suppose you'll regret it tomorrow morning?""",1661990583

That being said, I can understand Schreuder's anger at the situation and don't agree with ETH that they ""have to accept it."" I get that Antony wants a bigger challenge, and more money in the PL. At the same time, he was under contract and should have continued to fulfill his end of the bargain. More generally, player's don't have to sign extensions. They can leave on a free (and likely get more money in the process because a club doesn't have to pay a transfer fee). They choose to sign extensions for injury/concerns of future performance decline. That is also reasonable, but if you sign an extension then you should honor the contract and continue to train/practice as if you didn't have the ability to move to a new club during the window.",1661990583

They seem to all adopt the same strategy without realising it. I've matched with plenty of women and the only ones I have problems with are this sub sect of women, both bi and straight, they are the same. They put in no effort to conversations, expect to be chased constantly and they definitely will never make the first move after matching. I've learned to avoid those profiles now. I think you should still continue to look for someone, just hopefully now you'll be wiser in being able to weed out the pointless profiles. I hope you do find someone :)",1661990584

Obviously if you give extra money to 1 group but no extra money for the other groups, you care more about the group you are giving the extra money to.  You can't even argue you can't afford it because if you truly cared about them as much they you would just give less percentage tip to your waiter and then distribute it to all the other minimum wage workers at the establishments you visit so you tip all minimum wage workers equally if you really cared just as much about them.

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","Nah. It happens. It happened to me with other gacha games, I only had to play 20 mins a game but it was a slog to play thru, I eventually quit them. And these games were games I was an F2P/casual spender.

Genshin has by far been the longest I've played a game continuously, I've whaled and whaled some more on it, and despite that, the 30 mins-1 hour gameplay daily is perfect for my lifestyle. I can't play long-ass games like Elden Ring anymore because of work, I can't sit down and go on 3-4 hour gaming sessions.

I *still* love doing daily commissions. I *still* love the grind. But I know that it varies person to person. If you feel like playing Genshin already feels like work, that's the best indication that you need to take a break, or even better for your wallet, quit the game.

I don't foresee me ever getting sick of Genshin though. I'm on it for the long haul, my time and money investment are betting on it. Especially if Sumeru is an indication of future things to come. Not to say I'm feeling some sunken cost though, not at all. I whale on the game because I love playing it, not the other way around.",1661990584

"SeeTV","t5_l1wac","&gt;The kid of Edo was one of Jerlamarel's sons

What? Really? What makes you think so? I got the impression that it definitely wasn't, I don't think Jerlamarel even knew Edo had such a kid.

Firstly, I don't think Jerlamarel would have let Edo take the kid. He didn't let him take any of the other kids, and it really sounded like the adult son wasn't fully comfortable with giving Edo Haniwa, I don't think he would have felt that way if he was used to giving family members to Edo. But secondly, it looked to be like the child was Asian, not Black. The show seems to use being Black as a bit of a tell that someone is Jerlamarel's descendant, as the other seeing people we've seen are white (Wren and burn guy) or Asian (kid that was training with Edo).

&gt;Jerlamarel traveled the land for decades and met no one but Haniwa meets seeing people everywhere.

Yes! Great point as well!

When Haniwa meet Wren I actually thought this is such an obvious setup by Edo, so Haniwa feels like she ""found out"" Wren's ""secret"" and tells Wren everything. I thought Edo knew and specifically had Wren guard Haniwa to exploit that emotional bonding. Because what are the odds that out of all the people Edo could pick to guard her he just so happens to pick the one sighted person. Like yeah right.

But nope, turns out the writers just don't expect us to think too hard about stuff like that I guess haha

&gt;The guy, though he knew that 2 seeing persons are in Pensa, didn't even try to hide the fact he can see.

Haha that's true too. I didn't even think about that. There's no way he wouldn't have heard about the prince and princess being sighted. If he didn't want to be found out, he really should have left town or something.",1661990585

Instead of just shitting on people that live in states where you can drink the water, have you tried holding the Mississippi state government accountable? It's not NY stopping them from fixing their water. NY isn't forcing them to neglect their infrastructure. They caused their own fucking problems.

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","That depends entirely on the implementation and how much RAM you have. Some operated on segments, which were linear spans of address space that could often be arbitrarily sized, while others worked on page or DMA transfer sizes. In terms of address spaces, you would do 1 per application (assuming some fixed upper limit of how much memory you were going to hand over per application), but then allow further internal subdivision for different access rights. For something like CoW you would need minimally 2 carve-outs within a single address space, one for the read side (assuming read-implies-exec) and the other for write.

[Here is a good paper that introduces the same basic approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3837396_Fast_address-space_switching_on_the_StrongARM_SA-1100_processor) on StrongARM using ""domains"" (for which it supported up to 16). Here the CPU did have a proper TLB, but as I mentioned above with the QNX implementation, given the VIVT L1 this approach allowed address space changes on context switch without needing to flush the L1 caches by effectively serializing everything into a single virtual address space. This effectively limited the number of processes to 16, though.",1661990585

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Our Universe is expanding and with it the things inside. Stars radiate light. Since light travels in waves we can only see things within the visible spectrum. Through the expansion, these lightwaves are getting stretched thus ‚Äûmoving out‚Äú of the visible spectrum of light. They are getting more red the further they are away from us as red light has a longer wavelength. This is called redshifting. This can Go even further when its stretched out even more into the infrared spectrum - which we cant See with our naked eye. This is also the reason why the James webb telescope takes pictures with an infrared camera. In one of those deep space Images you  can Tell by the amount of red how far away galaxys are.

Another big factor is the time it takes the light to reach us. There are maybe millions of new Stars out there but we cant See them as the light is still traveling to earth. So when you look up in the Night sky you See the stars as they were millions of years ago, some of them maybe dont even exist anymore. And the Life of a Human is so short compared to a stars life. I mean the sun is like 5 billion years old and will be there for another 5 billion. So very unlikely that you will witness a new star appearing at the sky.",1661990585

You must not have ever fired a gun.....let alone own one.....The channel is darn near 2 miles.  A bullet won't go that far, particularly the 5.56 round that the Taiwanese infantry carries....  My sweet, summer child.....lol

EDIT:  *I made a mistake.  I knew, stupid me.  The channel is darn near 5 miles!  lol  No bullet on earth will travel that far!*

Lets us not forgot, a bullet coming down won't hurt you.  I have shot my own gun straight up in the air and stood there to have the bbs come down on my head.  It feels like rain.  There is something called terminal velocity.  All objects reach it and gravity won't make it come down faster.  Regardless of weight.

So no, the bullet won't kill a taxi driver in Xiamen when fired from Kinmen.  lol

Now there is a way to kill someone if you shoot close to parallel or slightly angled up from the earth.  But again, 2 miles that bullet won't travel.  Again, because of gravity.

If the Chaos Dwarfs are the exact same as normal Dwarfs but better, CA made them wrong, there are far fewer Chaos Dwarfs than normal Dwarfs and so have to fill out their army with much weaker Hobgoblins and Orc/Goblin slaves, their main infantry force should be worse than Dwarfs, same with a lot of their ranged, Chorfs have Hobgoblin archers instead of quarrelers, only blunderbusses instead of Thunderers. Their artillery should be on par until much higher tiers. There's already a reason why Chorfs get monsters and Dwarfs don't, there's already an inbuilt balance.

2. There is a difference between adding soul grinders, a unit you simply don't like, and adding units that remove a gap in a factions roster. Soul Grinders don't vastly change the play style of chaos factions, they already have super strong monsters in their army, it just adds on. Dwarfs however lack any monster units, so adding two good ones dramatically changes their play style and their weaknesses, it's not just a nothing addition to their army.

"TravelersTV","t5_3fhj7","I'm gonna talk from a wtiter and director's prespective, as for - they are the ones who are in charged of the stories.

The harsh truth, is that Carly is not relateable. And I'm not talking as a man who never saw her condition in real life. She is a very interesting kind of character, but to actually relate to her you're gonna need to have WAY more then one episode about her.

Carly Shannon is a woman with a son, who is trying to fight for her litteral life sometimes, to make sure her son is safe from her abusive ex boyfriend who is also a cop. This character is very relatable, very moden and quit a gold mine, to the show's popularity. The problem, is that the story is not about Carly Shannon, it is about Traveler 3465.

Traveler 3465 is a person whom all their lives learned how to fight and plan WAR-like plans. 3465 is a human weapon stuck with feellings, a weapon must have.

The reason her teamates are more relatable, even they are all in an unrealistic life is because:

Mac was meant to be a leader and he has got all the means he needs to be one. He is a jerk, like the host he got. He is a jerk because he must be. If he wont be a jerk, MANY people will die.

Philip is a person who heard too many sad stories and now using drugs to cope with it. This heppens a lot in real life.

Marcy.1 is a person who got death sentence and just tries to do the most good while she can. Almost every cancer-related story is alike it. Marcy.2 is a person who cant decide who she is, the woman the people around her belive she is (her team who knows Marcy.1) or who she belives she is (since she cant remember many of the feelings who made Marcy.1 into Marcy.1). Her story is about figuring out who she is. Still, relateable.

Trevor ment to be this wholsome old wise man everyone likes, and both thr actor and the writing nailed it.

Now we are left with Carly Shannon. She is not an abused woman who stands for herself agints her abusive ex boyfriend. She is a weapon, who cant understand and isnt equipped with the tools to be a mother and fight the broken system. She cannot do it. It isnt satisfy to watch it, because 3465 was not abused. Not by Jeff, at least. By the reality of the future. And this isnt the same kind of fight.",1661990588

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","not to mention was everything he said to me a lie, everything we did together a lie. I heard one of my favorite podcasters put it this way. everything you know, the relationship you had, is dead. there is a period at the end of that life. it will never be the same, you can start a ""new sentence"" but it will never be the same and everything you did, talked about, valued, treasured up until this point is going to feel like it was all a lie. I wish I could say that it gets better but it just gets easier to manage. Its like a box with a pain button in it. in that box with the button is a large ball that rolls over the pain button and you feel unmeasurable sadness and pain, the pin button never loses its power it is always the same intense pain every time it is pushed. While the ball is huge, it rolls around and hits that pain button all of the time, but over time the ball gets smaller and smaller, the ball now doesn't hit the pain button as often maybe once a month or once a week, because its not so big, but when it does it is still as intense as it was the first time. Eventually that ball will be very small, it will only hit the pain button once a year, but it still will be just as saddening and painful as it was the first time it was pressed.

How much of a difference does being a Shia or a Sunni amount to? Is the difference mostly political or mostly spiritual thus creating political differences? Also, I had a friend who was from Bangladesh and he said that Shia and Sunni weren't real things but they seem to be. Is it regional or something?    3. Is UKIP prominent? From what I've heard they had Farage break away and I haven't heard much else. What are the lib dems like?

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq"," NTA People always treat parents like they need to be perfect child raising robots and any hurtful or damaging act from the child needs to be brushed off to focus on the larger goal, of raising the child. Sure, the ex might have created the divide between op and his daughter. The daughter still said the words at a custody hearing and meant them in her own head. That had to hurt op very deeply. So he honored her wishes and reduced his contact with her, but still paid child support and contributed to her college fund, which he didnt have to do (college fund part not the child support obviously he legally has to pay child support). Obviously if the daughter approaches op and wants to fix their relationship, he should give her that chance. But their reconciliation should come from personal inner growth from the daughter, not her getting in a big argument with her mom and running off to daddy's house instead of dealing with her responsibilities. I wouldnt say op is under any obligation to house his daughter( and legally the mother cant kick her out of the house, so this is just a 17 year old arguing with her mom throwing a tantrum). Call the cops on your ex for throwing her out and tell your daughter she needs to deal with her issues responsibly and communicate with her mother.",1661990589

This is a massive point of contention in Boston.
