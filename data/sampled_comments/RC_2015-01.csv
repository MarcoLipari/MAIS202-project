 [**Brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. The term does not derive from the word ""brutal"", but originates from the French *béton brut*, or ""raw concrete"", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into ""brutalism"" (originally ""New Brutalism"") to identify the emerging style.

&gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the ""brick brutalists"" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.

&gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. ""Brutalism"" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, ""brutalism"" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for ""brutal"" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","Bugs I've noticed since the patch that really piss me off:

* Clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location, 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere, 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere.
* Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf?
* Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F. Movement seems warpy, people moving extra fast. It feels as though the server is trying to ""catch up"" and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast. 
* Been having the cloak glitch a lot. When infil, it gets stuck in this weird half-cloaked phase and I can't tell if I'm really cloaked or not. On HA, I occasionally get stuck glowing even when my shield is off.
* Invisible people. Many invisible people. And no, I'm not talking about infils.
* I'm sure there's more, I just can't remember them.","1420070409"

"genetics","t5_2qi3y","What an interesting question! I would have to say... We don't know. We know there are two pigments essentially a brown and red pigment that make up hair color. I'm pretty sure that the amount of red is controlled by 1 gene ( but MANY different alleles. ) We are not sure how many genes are involved in the amount of brown pigment. We just don't know enough to be able to predict offspring hair color. 

Disclosure: I am an undergrad in Bio and am not 100% current on hair color inheritance research! =p There may be more up to date info out there.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","The League Cup is contested by all teams in the English Football League system (PL, Championship, Leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from August to February. The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required.

The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May. However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter. 

Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper). 

Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties. 

Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley. 

Long post but there you go. The League Cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why Sunderland, Swansea, Bradford, Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","I've stuck with Coval as my go-to vendor since coming across them relatively early on in my vaping journey due to the 2x30ml/$20 Flavor of the Week specials' incentive and the quality of the liquids I've received through those promotions. Some of them aren't nearly favorites and I've also found some blends that I wouldn't have otherwise picked up that have turned out to be top ranking;  actually this week's [FOTW](http://www.reddit.com/r/ecig_vendors/comments/2qxcrd/buttery_nipple_and_pbb_cream_flavors_of_the_week/) are a couple of greats IMO. My favorites have changed up from time to time, currently I'm really liking 'Trails' the most (think trail mix) but I'm also enjoying getting to know '[Discovery](http://covalvapes.com/collections/artisan-series/products/discovery)'  it's new to me but I foresee it could become a contender before too long. The truth is Coval has exceeded my expectations and some of the blame for my not having tried [TVC](http://thevaporchef.com/), [Cyclops](http://www.cyclopsvapor.com/), [Keystone](http://keystonevapor.com/), [DBLiquids](http://www.dbliquids.com/), [Bombies](http://bombies.com/) or [Grizzly Vapes] (http://www.steammonkey.com/Default.asp) rests with Coval for providing those tasty vapes with competitive pricing, quick shipping and receptive, responsive customer service. I do feel I owe it to myself to try these and some other vendors, at the same time I feel like 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' and everything seems to be working well:)  I do enjoy seeing y'all recommending and promoting each other around these parts and hearing tell of your positive actions in the ecr and larger vaping community. Thanks for getting us the goods and the way you've gone about it!

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","It's a really good printer, but not without it's own issues.  The biggest irritation to me was PLA leaking from the hotend, but a fan duct printed and installed that put airflow across the heat sink on the head fixed the issue.

You can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the TAZ is frustration yet in the end they're glad they went with it.  Once you do find the sweet spot though it's a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 24/7.  In fact Lulzbot prints 24/5 with over a hundred of them.  As /u/jebba said in another thread there's a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer.  I'm sure the TAZ 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend.

I can't say anything really bad about Makerbot's 2/2x.  They have their own issues but once you work on them a bit they're solid workhorses.  The 5th gens... stay away for now.

MakerGear M2 is a really solid printer.  I know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhub's guide the printer is very well liked.

A printer I would highly suggest is an Ultimaker 2.  It has a smaller build volume than the TAZ but it's far less picky with settings.  It's my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels.  With ninjaflex and composite ninjaflex/ABS parts the TAZ wins hands down though.

If you can accept the build volume the Flashforge Creator Pro is a nice choice and very well built.  Any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site.  It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to documentation though.","1420070421"

The Pulse Laser on the same fire group as your Beam is probably dragging your Beam down.

Do you run with full power to weapons when you're firing the Beam?

Also, if you want to make much less trips back for ammo, just try a 1 BL, 2 MC setup. Or, depending on how you fly, you can BnZ with 3 heavy thermal weapons.
Rush in, dump all your weapon energy on the ship, fly out and recharge, repeat. If they start to jump, just use all your energy on a constant stream from your main Beam.","1420070422"

My initial post said they destroy them in speed runs, which they do from what I've seen.  If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops).

And while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.  Compared to 8:15 runs and 7:30 runs by fcmates, that's about three minutes.","1420070427"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","So, let me put it to you this way... right now, you're looking at a high-end overclockable CPU (which you're spending extra for, by the way, without buying a cooler!?), and to go along with that you're buying a shit low-end video card. So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams.

Drop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it.

If your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance. You don't need to sacrifice a quad-core processor, just don't be getting the most expensive one of the bunch, it doesn't fit the rest of your specs.

Anyway... good luck.","1420070432"

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","I was going to do a write-up on the state of out of body shields like Frost's Globe, Eximus mobile Globe and the Nullifiers shields. These abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game. I've been running massive amounts of T4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become. However, this is also because I have high RoF weapons in my T4 load out. The nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled Globes. This means, explosive munitions I.e. Penta nades, Ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players. Or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it. Another thing DE should consider is removing the damage limit on shields. Its pretty ridiculous how high RoF weapons are better against Nullifier shields (I've noticed this is only on Nullifiers) that slow high damage weapons. To put this into perspective, my Boltor Prime shoots spikes that deal ~800 damage to the nullifier shields. My opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag, 5 shots (~9 shots with multishot) to take the shield down. DE needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high RoF and slow RoF weapons to be viable.An idea I've been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs. Blast procs can CC enemies inside the shield while Magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself. By introducing this mechanic, Void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons.TL;DR 1) unify rules with regard to out of body shields. Players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own.2) Remove damage limit on shields to make slow RoF weapons viable against nullifiers.3) Add elemental weaknesses to the shields, bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void.","1420070433"

I'm a 23 year old junior in college studying to become a software engineer while minoring in metaphysical philosophy at NIU.

My first COD, and first FPS game period actually was BO2. I know, I'm WAY late to the party but I followed that game very closely outside of competitive because it was new to me &amp; I'm too competitive to suck at something but not do something about it. Thanks to /u/Drift0r's in depth series I got a really good grasp on the how the game worked pretty quickly and am pretty much a stat junkie in every game I play now.

Ghosts was the first game I watched competitively, and I'm drained. I've watched 4 AW streams, just can't get into it like I was before :/

I'm actually a bigger Battlefield fan than COD &amp; I'm ironically a lot better at it too. I once ranked first in the state of Illinois in skill &amp; score per minute. I haven't played in months though so I'm sure my ranks have plummeted.

Outside of the FPS stuff I listen to a LOT of music (15 different genres and sub genres) &amp; watch sports constantly, my favorite being baseball (White Sox). That's pretty much me.","1420070435"

"customhearthstone","t5_30mve","First of all, thanks a bunch for the detailed response, I'm extremely glad to hear you liked my cards.

I deliberately made Arcane Unraveling do nothing in aggressive match-ups (although technically it could net value with Mad Scientist), because I think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue. All the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control, but 5 additional cards, 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue, seems absolutely insane to me. Also, this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with Secrets and have Mad Scientist-esque effects into the game. I'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card, but I think against control it could be insanely useful.

I think Shadow Summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all; you pay 9 mana just to get the first Shadow Bomber on board (6 for the card, 2 for hero power, 1 for the Bomber), and you can only Hero Power once per turn. If you have pressure to go along with it, then yes, it will do work, but on its own I don't think it's that strong at all.

For Tinkerer, I imagined this card less as a Jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a mini-Gazlowe. I think if you even have two cards on board that generate Spare Parts (like a Gnome and Yeti) and you trade them in, this card gives you value. Two extra Spare Parts with Gazlowe or Antonidas or even Auctioneer is really good, and you're not paying too much to get them. 

Beastmaster can have synergy with Hunter cards obviously, allowing you to Houndmaster anything, enable Kill Command, etc. etc. This can let you do stuff like turn 4 Yeti turn 5 Beastmaster + Houndmaster, or turn 3 Harvest Golem turn 4 coin Beastmaster Houndmaster; basically it allows a work-around for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. It also synergizes with Druid of the Fang, I don't know if that's enough to make Beast Druid viable but I think it's worth considering. And, the most important part for me, it is a vastly superior Black Knight + Mark of the Wild with Hemet Nesingwary; a 6 mana Assassinate that also summons a 6/3 and a 2/1. 

Generator is insane if you can get value from it, but you have to run the Paladin secrets in exchange, which are pretty mediocre. And they won't get amazing value with the board state, except for Avenge; Redemption will be bad if they kill the Generator, Noble Sacrifice won't be spectacular, and the other ones will be garbage as usual.

I'll agree that Shadowy Archer is too strong; do you think making it a 1/2 would be fine (still better than Creeper, but it is a class card)?

For the Tortoise, it does seem limited, but I think in a deck with a lot of card draw, or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws, playing 2/2s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. A comparison could be made with Hogger in terms of how 2/2 Taunts can snowball out of control. Also it's a Beast, though I don't know how useful that is.

I didn't consider the Shade comparison with Fel Imp at all, I think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker, when making it I was thinking of the synergy with Floating Watcher; you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. Also with Blood Imp on board he grows faster than Shade as well, although not by much. He's probably a much worse play in the early game, but I think when you can play him and a few health-buffing effects immediately he shines.

For Neighborhood Blacksmith, I think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons, but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. And if you only get a few more charges, then he's pretty comparable to Greenskin;  with 1 minion, he's just worse, with 2 it's arguable (+1/+1 on the weapon but -2 Attack), so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better Greenskin. Which for current Warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.

Thanks again for the response!","1420070436"

you've only failed if you give up nofap. I'd like to post something that I posted on pornfree

""Well, I had been on a 7 day streak then I gave up. I was still motivated so I started again and went on a 22 day. Then I began doubting myself and what I was doing. I watched a few films in that streak and found myself enjoying scenes of sex *more* than usual. This caused it to snowball.

What helped immensely from that streak (my longest) is when an arousing thought hits you, **immediately** shut it down. Don't try to ignore it but rather tell it to fuck off and this next step is key to shutting it down: **move away from your previous room/activity** and do something else.
If you disagree with the thought but don't move away, it'll be like a drug addict telling himself he's going to the store when he's actually heading towards a trap house/drug house.  

I know myself better than anybody else. I find it hard to really register others' feelings when they're trying to motivate me so I made a video where I convince myself in a time of need, to move on. 

This is both to prevent procrastination and watching porn: I leave my phone across my room. Others choose to keep it across the house or in their safe but this is sufficient for me. I use an alarm and it forces me to stand up. Once I am up, I won't go back. 

Lastly, reward and recognise your achievements! Make a vague reward plan. After a week of my new life, I will treat myself to a mcflurry. On the second, I'll get a subway sandwich. On the third, a cinema visit and fourth, a new trouser. Something like that 

Never forget to reread your goals. **Never become complacent**.

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","Hey!

I get your point.  unfortunately i think you either responded to the wrong topic or got confused - this post was about tight rulesets, not about balance, but you seem to use those interchangably.  You can make tight rules with an unbalanced system, or a balanced system with not tight rules.

If it was about balance, well, warmachine/hordes is one system that supports 14 full factions, and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  So the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 16-18 factions really breaks the camels back there, but i cant see it.




But back to the tight ruleset -  warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  It's not the minute rules interactions.  Really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.

A systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.

40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time, and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing, leading to confusion.

40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  Most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule, then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.

To use an example earlier today - ""a single passenger can fire out of each Fire Point"".  This is a poor rule as it stands, because the timing is not defined, and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you ""Fire"" psychic shooting attacks?  Are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?

A tighter defined rules set would have defined ""fire"" as making a ranged attack, and ranged attacks as psychic, shooting, etc.  It would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.

To use an example from a comprehensive ruleset, in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  In 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads ""All blue lands produce an extra mana"".  

That would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined, it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce, do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  Theres just a lot of problems with that wording, you know this without even playtesting it.

Thats why magic words it ""Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds Blue to his or her mana pool""   The timing is defined, tap is a defined term in the rules, everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.

Just reading through different games' rulesets, you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend, not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  It's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules, it's the way they are written.

Obviously no one expects something like this to happen, but puppies have no concept of social cues and can get into trouble suuuper easily (and not just with other dogs). If the roommate wasn't watching the puppy, the puppy should have been someplace safe where it wouldn't get into trouble (chewing on inappropriate items, going potty inside, etc). Similarly, OP should have crated his own dog if he knew Charlie had a history of snapping or knew that the puppy would be left unattended with him.

I'm not saying by any means that it's all the roommate's fault, but these were two dogs that should not have been alone with each other and both owners failed to keep them separated. Should he help out with bills? Probably, yeah. But should he feel obligated to foot 100% of the expenses? I really don't think so.","1420070446"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","""No organism is imaginary"" is my point.  We assume homo sapiens do not want their lives ended unless they explicitly say so.  The reason people oppose abortion is because they believe the organism being aborted is a homo sapien, and if it is a homo sapien then abortion is murder, which is something libertarians oppose.  The reason people oppose abortion is not because God said it is bad.  Therefore, the criticism against the opposition to abortion is itself based on something imaginary - a belief either no one or practically no one has.

Even if people believed that abortion was wrong simply because God said it was wrong, then that still would not justify opposing laws against abortion because otherwise we would have to oppose laws against murder given there are people who support laws against murder due to God saying it is wrong.","1420070450"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;In The Communist Manifesto, Marx predicted imminent revolution in Europe.
http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marx-publishes-manifesto
He also predicted it in advanced countries. Not only has this not happened, over 100 years later, but when attempted it was in backwards feudal countries. The attempts resulted in class based authoritarian command economies that failed.
The Manifesto summarised their analysis: the big battles between the feudal order and the bourgeoisie were imminent

1848 was a year of revolutions in Europe.
In 1871 the Paris commune was founded.
The russian revolution started in Russia's industrial centers, Moscow and St Petersburg, and this is where Bolshevicks had support. In the country side other socialists were far more popular.
At the same time there is an uprising or riots or whatever in Germany that is put down by SPD, at the time an officialy marxist party.

Marxism never really caught on in the anglosaxon world (there were cases when socialists would get up to 5 or 6% of the vote followed by ""Red Scares"", see Eugene Debbs or read the Grapes of Wrath for a closer look at that era) and it then got mixed with the anti-colonial movement that flourished in many less developed countries with economies based on agriculture.

But it's wrong to say that it applies on feudalism. Even today with communist parties far weaker in general you see them getting strong in industrial centers in a number of european countries.","1420070451"

Well, explain to me the differences in results then, because you haven't done so as of yet.

&gt;I am not sure what you are saying exactly.

You're saying that his post is wrong and is dismantled by switching to an opt-in system. However, the solutions to the questions that he asked have nothing to do with an opt-in system. In fact, they have to do with a system which actively compels everyone else to pick up the tab. 

&gt;This is a very poor argument. Someone who is sterilized may not want to pay taxes that give subsidies for families (someone else's child), yet they are forced to.

That's my point. You're arguing that forcing someone to pay for the child is wrong in one circumstance, but totally fine in another. The sterilized person hasn't opted-in to paying for the child, so, as per your framework, they shouldn't be forced to pay it.","1420070453"

TLDR: by going 1 mph slower than I suaully drive 11 hours a day I lose $250 per month. 

We don't do it because we're trying to save fuel. It's to get ahead of the driver plain and simple. 
The typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars don't get held up from us passing. 
First off, fuck anyone who says that. It's fucking selfish. 
If I'm going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph I'm going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car can't wait a minute while I pass someone. 
If the guy I'm passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles. If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year that's 183,000+ miles per year that he's doing. 
Now I come along doing 65mph. Which using the same math I cover 2,000 more miles a year than him. 

On a typical day with my current outfit I make about $250 per day doing about 350 miles. So since I'm covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means I'm losing $250 per month. 
Now he doesn't directly cause this loss of income because he's just trucking along minding his own business. But I'm losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go. 
So regardless if someone is approaching I'll swing around him, get back up to speed, pass him and then move back over. And then you can go by no problem. 
Additionally, I don't want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass. Anyone can agree with that. 

If you made it this far then that's good. Haha

A Truck driver is on the road for weeks at a time. We deal with every kind of driver. Some are kind and considerate. Some are giant dicks almost accidents. Most are inconsiderate pricks who think that their time is more precious than mine.

The problem is he still has Ock's personality, which is his weakness. Having ""no fear"" is a SEVERE liability. If you're reading Spider-verse, time shifted SSM just lost to Peter because he's so full of himself, he couldn't even conceive of having lost to Peter in his future that he assumed Peter was from the past. That kind of arrogance leads to failure quickly.

 I can see him getting full of himself on power, and planning on taking on more than he can handle (essentially exactly what happend when he got the symbiote and fought the Avengers) and immediately getting thrashed by someone severely out of his league. Shoot, that's kind of the entire arc of Superior Spider-Man straight through the end of Goblin Nation.

Now hypothetically who would he be strong enough to beat if it weren't for the terrible personality defects? Oh now that is a long list. Considering Peter's body on its own has beaten a herald of Galactus, It would be quite a force within the Marvel U with Extremis.

So you're telling us that homicide, burglary, and rape are that far underreported among whites when compared to blacks? 

You really have no data showing blacks are patrolled more than whites. 

Perhaps you can point to specific departments who stopped blacks disproportionately in stop-and-frisks. But that's entirely different from the police state you make it sound like blacks live under versus a police-less society whites live under. 

&gt;the kid smoking a joint on the corner in a sleepy suburb is committing the same crime, but nobody's there to see or care, so the numbers stay low.

Let's go ahead and move forward with your thesis: let's ignore petty crime, like drug possession, entirely. Look at murder, rape, and burglary—you'll still see much higher numbers for blacks when compared to whites based on their overall population.

"beer","t5_2qhg1","NextGlass is a bit different though. If you scan the label (or search by name) of a beer/wine, it will tell you the likelihood that you will enjoy it based on a chemical analysis of beers/wines you have previously rated. 

So for example, if you are at the grocery store and you are not sure about a beer, you can scan the label and it will give you a score like 87.8% or 37.6%. which is just their guess at whether or not you will like it. I've played with it a little by scanning beers I know that I already know I like or dislike and and I think it does give make pretty damn good predictions once you've added enough reviews to your profile.

If you rate a beer/wine in their app, it won't tell you, ""If you liked this then you might like Beer X"" the way untappd does. It just stores that score data and uses it develop a profile for your likes and dislikes.




Their biggest shortcoming is that they actually have to have a sample of the beer/wine sent in for analysis to be able to rate it, so their database is lacking all but the more widely available and mainstream beers for the most part. It's still pretty new and growing though, and they claim to be constantly adding more and more to it. I think their scoring system is a little vague too (4 star system and you can't even give 0 stars) and I would like more depth to it like a score out 10 instead of 4. ","1420070456"

In a situation like this, the workers found property that would be considered mislaid property (as opposed to lost or abandoned property). Mislaid property is property that was put there intentionally by the owner of the property, and the owner for some reason forgets to retrieve it. The charges were dropped because the property at issue (the cash) belongs to whoever placed it there and forgot about it. Since the owner of the house is not the person who placed and forgot it, it is technically not his property (it actually still belongs to the person who placed it there in the first place). Since the owner of the house does not actually own the cash, he cannot be the individual to claim he was deprived of the property (since the property is not technically his).

 [**Welfare queen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%20queen): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Welfare queen__ is a [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative) phrase used in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America) to refer to people, usually women, who are accused of collecting excessive [welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_(financial_aid\)) payments through fraud or manipulation. Reporting on welfare fraud began during the early 1960s, appearing in general interest magazines such as *[Readers Digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers_Digest)*. The term entered the American [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) during [Ronald Reagan's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) [1976 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States\)_presidential_primaries,_1976) shortly after he described [a woman abusing welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Taylor) from [Chicago's South Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Side_(Chicago\)), but he never used the term ""welfare queen"" when referencing the woman.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","It just occurred to me that perhaps I didn't explain my reason for wanting it very well. This may fall on deaf ears now, and maybe rightfully so, but my interest was in allowing someone interested to explore more in depth, with the added benefit of fact checking. 

I just realized this after looking a thread on executive order and seeing a comment about it being ok because it still doesn't allow for allocation of funds. Great, that's probably true. But, selfishly, I would love to click on that and see a link to original rights bestowed to executive order.. then, you could get commenters talking about ways those initial right had been altered through precedents, which could again be linked. You could follow your way through that like wikipedia, but with more informed people showing you a path in which to search.

And that would be cool! I just hope you at least see my underlying desire for it, especially since you kept responding and then received a shitty answer from me. I'm not a total dick, I just wanted a cool way to learn a ton of information quickly. ","1420070459"
"intj","t5_2qowo","Hmm. Saying something and expecting a particular response, in order to test the person, is a bad idea in general and I think it's especially bad if they're INTJ. We're good at picking up on that sort of thing and we don't like it. If we feel like someone's trying to manipulate us, we're likely to shut that person out.

We're direct and we expect other people to be. If you want to know whether he cares, ask, and believe his answer. And be open about your own feelings.

The ""I'm busy"" responses sound to me like an indication that he doesn't care much about you. You're just online friends, you've never met or spoken to each other? It sounds like he doesn't think it's a very close relationship. I don't know if this is common with INTJs but I don't feel very close with people I only know online. If someone online tells a sob story, I'll probably say something sympathetic just to be polite and I feel sorry for them just like I feel sorry for someone I read about in the news who's suffering, but I don't actually care like I would about someone I'm close with. INTJs take a while to warm up to someone, we tend not to have a lot of close friends. It sounds like you're expecting a high degree of emotional connection from someone who might just see you as an acquaintance or casual friend because he doesn't know you well enough yet. It's not a matter of you telling him more about your life, there's no way to force it. If you want to get closer with him then try to have more personal interaction like Skype or visiting. And if he's not interested in doing that then you have your answer.","1420070459"

Guild recruitment sites haven't been updated for several months if not all the way since July. The biggest issue I have with getting back into the game is working out, 'do I go back to my old characters or do I start over' and the biggest and toughest question with that is where to go and what to do to find other players and what to do to make friends.

Being away for so long and seeing the game as quiet as it is I just log on once in a while and roll about doing dailies (the very reason I left). And I don't even know if I'm gaining anything by that if I end up starting over on Exile side or the other server.

I had to get out and do a field sobriety test because I refused to blow, which is legal by the way. I failed the field sobriety test even though I feel I passed it. I wasn't drunk, my cognitive skills were functioning fine. 

He kept trying to get me to tell him how many drinks I had, I kept silent. I only gave answers to questions that could not be used against me. If I was drunk I wouldn't be that smart. We get to the station and I give blood. I have no idea what my BAC was. I had to blow to be released and about 30 minutes after I gave my blood it said .13. I am awaiting my actual BAC from the blood test. 

I didn't blow because I wanted the most accurate reading I could get. Even if I was over .08 I don't trust those machines, nor do I trust the law to not fiddle with them. I don't know if that is even possible but I still don't trust the machine. ","1420070459"

One thing I'm not sure you touched on, and i assume would during the psychosis scene later, was the relationship between Olive and Caden, and Olive and Adele. You showed eaches reaction to her becoming upset at the idea of having blood, but their relationship itself wasn't talked about (if I'm remembering correctly). It always seemed to me that Adele wanted to push the responsibility of Olive onto Caden, yet when she leaves, she takes Olive with her. Almost as if she's enjoying the fruits of Olive's childhood, but leaving Caden to eat the rest. Further is the idea that Olive is in fact an extension of Caden, Adele can never escape Caden as long as Olive is with her, which to me comes back to the scene where Olive is afraid of the blood inside her. Caden tries to tell her that yes, she has blood (he wants to feel a bit of himself is in Olive), but Adele tells Olive that she doesn't have blood (saying Caden is not in Olive) which allows her to escape from Caden, with Olive, and not feel like, or able to deny, that Caden's work still lingers in the form of Olive.","1420070460"

It could present a way to stop people from making absurd numbers of alt accounts and farming achievements, that was the issue with that event wasn't it?  If they played the event out just as before, but with a minimum Steam Level to trade the relevant items (low enough to be widely accessible, high enough that you have to have had Steam for at least a little while), I think it would nip those issues in the bud.

I don't mind the cards so much because it's essentially free money to me, I've saved quite a bit of extra dosh over the course of this sale, and appreciate a handful of change off most of the games I buy.  The gems on the other hand, I don't really see them as useful or exciting to anyone except those who have invested extremely heavily in Steam trading.  If you run the conversion rates it's almost always advantageous to sell your cards to Russian money launderers instead.

I hope they get around to doing something different with the sale items you get too.  As it is they're very lackluster, being essentially a sub-par Steam sale you can use off-season.  It doesn't even particularly matter if they save you a ton of money, I'd just like them to be fun and interesting in some way.","1420070464"

Jake awoke to the rumbling sound of helicopters flying low over his house. Sitting up slightly and squinting through the haze of sleep, he looked at the clock on his nightstand. Instead of the glowing red numbers, there was only darkness. Then he checked his watch.

3:54 AM.
 
With a sigh he dropped back onto his pillow causing his wife to stir and mutter something unintelligible. Just then a searchlight swept across his yard illuminating his bedroom windows before moving on.

“Fucking Mondays.” He said aloud. Beside him his wife continued to sleep soundly despite the continuing noise. He rolled over and put an arm around her, smiling as he snuggled close to her warmth, envying her ability to sleep through anything. 

Then, over the drone of rotor blades, an announcement sounded in an amplified voice. “A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered to exit your homes, remain on your front lawn and await further orders.” The message began to repeat.
What? He thought, utterly confused. Everyone has to go outside? What’s going on? Begrudgingly he arose and walked to the window as a spotlight swept his house again. Down the street he could see several military vehicles as well as a few patrol cars with red and blue lights flashing. Several of his neighbors were already on their lawns looking sleepy and bewildered in their nightclothes. Then he noticed what looked like a greyhound bus being loaded. “What the?”

“What is it honey?” Sue asked having finally awoken and sat up.

“I don’t know. The police and the military are down the street and they are ordering everyone outside. It looks like they are loading people onto a bus.”

“The military? A bus?” She sounded incredulous. Then she heard the announcement amidst the cacophony. 

“A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government. Power and electronic communications networks are down. For your safety, everyone is ordered…” it continued. 

“They’re coming up the street!” Jake said. “They just kicked in Rob Merkele’s door!” His pulse quickened.

“They’re doing what?” Sue asked, still not fully awake.

“They’re dragging his family outside!” 

“Who? The police?”

“The military!” He turned from the window to face Sue. “Fuck this. I don’t know what’s going on but I don’t like it.”

“What are we going to do?” She asked.

He pulled the blinds back again but didn’t answer. The windows were shaking from the helicopters. “They just kicked the Hampton’s door in!”

By now Sue had gotten out of bed and was standing beside Jake looking out of the window.

“Get the kids up and get them in here.” He said.

“Right.” Said Sue and ran from the room and down the hall, turning lights on as she went.

Two more houses and they would be here. What to do? What to do? He thought about hiding places within the house. The attic. The back of a closet. The trunk of their car. Nothing was right. Should he just go along with this?

Sue came back with their two children Tom, 5, and Emily who was 7. They were on their feet but still mostly asleep. 

“Go grab a bunch of their clothes and any medicines they may need. We’ve only got a few minutes. They are almost here.” 

“What to do? What to do?” He kept asking himself aloud. Must he go along with whatever this was? How could they get away? Scanning his memory of the area, he remembered a drainage ditch beyond his property in the back yard that ran into a large tunnel. It was a chance.

Jake ran out of the room to find his wife. “Sue? Sue?”

“Yes?” The sound came from Emily’s room. 

“Sue! Quick, get them dressed as best you can and shoes on their feet, we are going to try to get out by the drainage tunnel behind the house.”

“The drainage tunnel? Is that safe?” She asked.

“It’s our only chance.”

She was still doubtful. “We don’t even know what’s going on. They may shoot us if we run. And if we do get away what then?”

It was obvious how scared she was as she was standing there in her nightgown, bundles of clothes in her arms.

There was a hard knocking at the front door. They both jumped at the sound. “Open up! Open the door!” Pound! Pound! Pound! There were several voices. “Everybody on the street now! Open up. Open the door or we will break it down!” Pound! Pound! Pound!

The look in her eyes as she shook her head no told him all he needed to know. She wouldn’t be running anywhere with the kids. For a moment they just stood there looking at each other in the midst of the chaos. Pound! Pound! Pound!

“Ok.” He said, and walked to open the front door.

There was a large crash as the door busted open. The cops or military men, he couldn’t tell, streamed inside. They were dressed in all black and their weapons were at the ready. 

“Police! Police!” they yelled as they progressed through the house. They came upon his family huddled on the bed in Jake and Sue’s bedroom.  “Everybody on the floor! Everybody down! Get on the floor!”

Jake was in front of his family, his arms spread wide covering as much of them as he could.

“On the fucking ground now!” The point man yelled. His weapon was pointed at Jake’s head where a red dot now bounced and jiggled. “Do it now! Do it now!”

Jakes heart sank. He was powerless. Here were a bunch of armed men threatening his family and all he could do was shield them with his body. Both of their children were sobbing as his wife held them.

“On. The. Fucking. Ground. Now!” The point man shouted. The other men behind him were now coming in and shouting orders and pointing their weapons. The point man grabbed Jake’s wrist and yanked him off of the bed, throwing him to the ground and putting a knee in his back. The second man in grabbed his wife’s wrist pulling her to the ground causing her to scream.

“Hey!” Jake shouted, pulling his head as far off of the ground as he could trying to see. “Stop hurting my wife!” His arm was grabbed, twisted behind his back and a handcuff was snapped around his wrist.

“Stop resisting!” the man on top of Jake yelled.

A third man came into the room, grabbed his daughter and threw her to the floor. She yelled as he did so and began crying loudly.

“Stop you motherfuckers!” Jake yelled. 

The person on top of him put an elbow into his face. “Shut up and stop resisting!” He twisted the other hand around his back preparing to cuff him. Spurred on by the cries of his family and without thinking, he tried to roll over but had no leverage. This prompted another elbow to the face. He tried throw the guy again. This time his left leg found purchase against the nightstand and he pushed. 

Under normal circumstances there would be little chance of anyone bucking a trained fully grown man off of their back, but this was a father protecting his family. A split second of superhuman strength was all that was needed to send him flying against the dresser. Flailing, the cop or whoever grabbed at a partially open drawer as he fell and brought the dresser down on top of himself. Jake, now on his feet, barely avoided the falling dresser as he lunged for the person on top of his wife at the foot of the bed.

He had his knee in the back of her neck and was preparing to cuff her when they made contact. Both went rolling. Jake ended up on the bottom. The man threw several punches and landed a few on Jake’s face, then paused and reached behind himself. Jake took a swing at the man’s face but his fist missed. The free end of the half fastened handcuff did not. It struck the man squarely in the cheekbone, making solid contact enough to break the bone and send blood pouring from his nose and cut onto Jake. That sent the man’s hands to his face as he let out what would have been, if not for the circumstances, a comically effeminate scream. Jake did not notice. All he knew was that the man was no longer trying to fight. Another swing and the handcuffs connected with his temple silencing him.

Jake struggled to his knees, pushing the man off of him and got to his feet. The other person clearing the house, hearing the struggle, now made his way down the hall and into the room. Seeing his one comrade holding his blood covered face and the other struggling to get a dresser off of him, he went into kill mode. He raised his weapon and pulled the trigger as Jake came at him. The sound was instant and sharp, quickly reducing the noise of his kids crying, the helicopters outside, everything, to a high pitched ring.

Jake did not feel the bullet pierce his midsection right below the sternum, was not aware of the .223 round’s tumble as it ripped through flesh and guts, spilling bile and blood where it should not go. Jake was only aware of the man in front of him at as his momentum carried them both to the floor. This time Jake was on top. Rage consumed him. Viciously he punched the man, trying to destroy him, his very existence. Over and over his fist made contact with the man’s face, nose, mouth. Teeth cut his knuckles which began to bleed. Blood splattered everywhere.","1420070464"

Different countries often recognize borders and sovereign countries. 

I expect that an atlas sold in Taiwan would be labeled slightly differently from one sold in mainland China for example and the Greeks and Turks might label Cyprus slightly differently. In Russian maps the Crimean peninsula is already included as part of Russia while much of the rest of the world portrays it as still belonging to the Ukraine. Whether or not a map includes Western Sahara probably depends a lot on who draws the borders on it.

Countries don't exist the same way mountains and lakes do. They are not indisputable features of geography, they are social constructs. If you are going to sell your maps in areas where certain countries or borders are not officially recognized it would be a good business decision to conform to the local official definitions rather those followed elsewhere.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","yea dude its conditioning yourself to only be hungry while high.

Happened to me when I would come home from my university. Would have no hunger while not under the influence. The only bad part was that I got underweight (been a skinny kid my whole life), which is unhealthy. 

What I did to overcome it was, 1.) cut on smoking (like nights only), 2.) eat before you smoke (let the chemistry in your brain calibrate to be hungry while not high). Its gonna be a bit rough to get back there (takes 1-2 weeks w/ tolerance break)

Not that I've heard of, and certainly nothing that was universally applied. While the Inquisition was present across Europe their attitudes and techniques varied drastically based on location. Just about the only universal things were the *protections* that the Inquisition promised to the accused (beyond what the legal system at the time offered) and the format of the tribunal.

I always have 5 stacks of Evangelism before the cooldown on Archangel finishes. That's because I fit in at least 2-3 smites in between the charge up time. The other stacks come from using Solace off cooldown.

I only pop Archangel when I need to throw out Prayer of Healing / Cascade. I believe the guaranteed PoH crits from Empowered Archangel is more valuable than the bonus healing. If I don't see a time in the future where I'd be using those two spells, I'll just use it for the benefit of +25% healing.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","How about you ask me about something rather than make assumptions?   

I've been pretty clear and transparent.

My investment firm, Atlantic Financial, bought the company Fleetwood Video some years back and changed the name to FDVT or Fleetwood Digital Technology Corp.- I believe 2004 or so but I am not positive -- certainly quite a while back.  A family of a deceased business owner approached me and asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate.  I figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old (founded in 1985) and the customer list and registration to do business with the government.

The company served the clients mentioned - mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras.  That's pretty much what the business did.  One of the Atlantic Financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didn't.   

The company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again.  We considered pursuing some government business but didn't.  The company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on -- the internal employee working on it moved on.   The small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase.  

I had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and I'm a disabled vet -- but I never used that certification or pursued those lines of business.  It's really not my cup of tea.  I had also considered using the business as a vehicle to help out a freind who is a martial arts trainer who had trained military and police - so he could run contracts through the business since it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward.

We scrapped all the inventory, delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with.   The company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years.

At the time -- 2004 or so, I was not as adamantly against the government as I am now.  I had some interest in some types of government contracts -- I didn't pursue them but some of the work such as USAID efforts in Pakistan and security work interested me.  I didn't pursue it, it doesn't interest me now and I don't do any government work now.   Even the tiny bit of work that this company, which was owned by my company did was not something I was personally active in or profited from.

I am only giving so much information for full disclosure.   That client list is pretty similar for Google, Microsoft, Dell etc Etc.   The government buys a lot of stuff.   I don't like it, I don't prefer working woth government and I wish they were smaller.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt;Black holes in DC are not like ours, hell, their gravity is not like ours either. Superman was able to contain the gravity of a virtual black hole!!

Sure they do.

&gt;He contained gravity, that makes any sense to you? Can you explain that to me with logic?

It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. 

&gt; Magic making something that weights infinity, lighter, makes no sense to me either (in this particular situation), how much is infinity minus a million times a quadrillion tons? Still infinity!

Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension.

&gt;If they had magic that could make the book weight less than infinity, there is no difference from making it weight as much as a planet or a glass of water.

Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. 

Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. They can make magic compress infinite weight into a ""manageable"" weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight.

Maybe volunteer somewhere? This will also help you when you apply for grad school. Social work is a very, very hands on job. A lot of it just can't be taught in class which is why internships and volunteer work is crucial. Good luck! ","1420070480"

I've had great luck with my layout, even when I'm not sniped those who push have only achieved up to 50% except one guy who dropped a BK. The walls by my TH are aesthetic but the other serve WB purposes and the one in the middle was just to push them around into the bombs. My spring traps have launched more giants than my defenses have killed. The big bomb? Idk... I had extra wall pieces there like next to my cc but WB's haven't been a problem at all. Mass giants or mass archers have been the biggest threat. They drop em to take out that AD knowing they'll also take a crack at that vital ""exposed"" wall piece. After the AD is gone they throw out a healer which my balloons and archers dispose of. 

I like finally getting to discuss my base with someone! Keep the suggestions and advice coming. If I pushed my ad behind walls say where the BB is, any advice for the BB? I've tried many layout edits to fit it in the middle but was never happy. I just recently swapped my mortars with my elixir storages. Glad I did. But idk what to expect after this wall grind.

* works with the keyboard dock
* doesnt have charging problems
* doesnt have battery drain issues
* still in some state of development so that bugs might have a chance of being fixed

The 3 that I've found that seem to be most discussed are:

* zombi-x: http://forum.xda-developers.com/transformer-prime/development/rom-t2920306
* crombi-kk: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2773812

"flying","t5_2qm1t","I understand what you mean, but it is not like you are saying. Running lean is a vague term. You have a temperature peak around the stœchiometric of the fuel. The peak begins before lambda and ends after lambda. The danger here is that running a tad bit leaner than lambda will increase combustion temperature. If you continue to lean, there will not be enough fuel to produce heat thus the peak goes down. 

What I am saying is that it is difficult without proper engine monitoring to determine if you are passed the heat peak or not. CHT temp is critical IMHO. because the head gets less oil and is only cooled by air, the only other way to keep it cool is to run richer. The unburnt fuel will drop the combustion temperature at the cost of producing more undesirable by-byproduct. 

The only fuel that I know that will burn hotter when richer is the Diesel and alike (jet fuel and such). They are totally different than 100LL. ","1420070485"

"Solving_A858","t5_2uyi4","&gt; Even if it does change, why was Massachusetts on there anyways? Is it just a coincidence its where Reddit is based, 

Not entirely sure what youre asking so this might not be the answer youre looking for: Essentially it is just a coincidence, A858 has various timezones it uses, one of those happens to fall in line with Massachusetts. The important factor is its controlled by the bot itself and likely has absolutely no relation to where the bot is located in real life.

&gt; how the reason why nothing has been solved yet is because there is nothing to solve

Plenty of things have been solved, take a look at this list: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/Solving_A858/wiki/posts

Some of them are not yet completely solved however eventually they will be. It is clear that the owner of the bot is aware that we are solving these codes and are specifically putting out puzzles - hence why theres no way its used to test reddit. 

If youre wondering why the bulk of it isnt being solved is because its not yet possible. There are clues in the easier puzzels which give information on how to solve the main bulk. The working theory is those messsages you see being posted constantly are actually part of groups and are more than likely encrypted. There is no way of outright breaking the encryption (or incredibly low chance) so we rely on solving the other puzzels to even be able to think about trying to solve those. 

&gt;there might just be a certain pattern to the random strings generated (e.g on letters a-f are included)?

The pattern you are seeing is HEX encoding. Essentially hex is any 0-9 A-F (Where A = 10 and F = 16).  Hex is a way of displaying non-text(non ASCII) data in a human readable format.

The more modest you dress, the more holy you become and appear, the more attractive you will be to some. In fact, bad people might even see modesty as a target.

This is a harsh truth, but I have had it confirmed by others.

Exercise, observe the world around you, talk to and engage with strangers on the street (even if it's a simple ""hello""). Join a club, a gym or do yoga. These are all things you can do that will (A) help your body feel good which put you in a good frame of mind and (B) get you out and meet people.

"investing","t5_2qhhq","Absolutely liquidate. Our bank's PB is not in the business of taking a hit/loss because we let a client blow through their margin. This is the response to the asset declining significantly in value, not necessarily the same thing as ""rates rising"".  There is also no guarantee a firm will pay its obligations on the debt (especially on jr unsecured or other lower priority tranches). In the event of catastrophic failure of a credit portfolio, the hedge fund can declare bankruptcy, wipe their hands clean, and owe us nothing beyond the liquidation value of the fund (and at 5x leverage, ""catastrophic"", where we could potentially incur a loss, would be a 20% hit in equity of the portfolio). Any deficit between that and the margin they posted would be our bank's loss.  Likewise, if they were to walk away from a negative margin equity portfolio, it could potentially take days (or weeks) to liquidate positions of a hedge funds size.  During this time, the liquidation could accelerate the market to move against the assets thus forcing greater losses on the bank.

This is why liquidity considerations are part of the margining methodology. In stocks we look at multiples of 100x avg daily trade volume. With credit we're concerned with % of outstanding issuance as well as # of available executable pricing sources (from appropriately sized dealers) and frequency of those broker quotes. 

This generalizes your question though. Credit portfolios don't inherently suffer when rates rise. There are plenty of floored and variable coupon and step coupon corp bonds out there that are intrinsically lower duration. ","1420070491"

"CannabisExtracts","t5_2r341","I've seen them in a lot of medical places, but not in the places with the highest quality of bud. Honestly each place has a different definition of caviar and there are so many variables:

Is BHO used at all and what quality is that, really? nobody is using the 60/g nug run shatter for caviar.

What quality is the kief? If it is just farmer's grade dry sift it can easily be 50-70% contaminant or more (read: not many trichome heads) and is often added to lower quality bud to make it seem more resinous. 

What quality is the bud? Is there variation between the different layers? How goddamn expensive is it and how do I smoke this thing?

I think of it as a way for dispensaries to combine excess or unwanted material into a desirable product. I'd much rather have high quality bubble, flower, and oil separately over paying a premium for a mystery. It's kind of a tourist trap, you'll never see someone buy a gram of full melt and a gram of caviar at the same time.

Of course I'm sure there are a few places with good, properly priced caviar, but I'm not gonna look for them.","1420070493"

"europe","t5_2qh4j","From what I can understand the rationale for the price reduction has nothing to do with helping people get more drunk during the recession. It's to stop people who can't afford to consume the legal vodka from purchasing illicit supplies.

The government in the past decade has been increasing taxes on it and implementing stricter rules. It's reduced consumption and deaths by a third so far. However the downside to this is that illicit vodka is becoming more common for those who can't afford the prices.

This has been a problem for some time now.

http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/07/17/russias-vodka-tax-backfiring/
&gt; As many experts – and drinkers – warned from the start, high taxes on alcohol have driven hard-drinking Russians to seek out cheaper, illegal sources of booze. Vodka makers complain that they can no longer compete with a thriving black market offering cut price liquor and moonshine.

http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/21-11-2012/122882-vodka-0/
&gt; According to official figures, the volume of vodka sold on the Russian market doubles the amount of produced vodka. In 2011, the statistical difference was 40 percent. Factory counterfeit products, produced in the ""fourth shift"", are available in all cities of Russia and take about one-third of the market - one billion bottles.


It's right for the government to take action on Vodka consumption and illicit production. Russia has sorted it's self out from being the demographic basketcase it was, however there are still to many Russians dying unnecessarily. Unless they can stop police and officials from turning a blind eye on the illicit production, raising taxes won't do much. 

They need to take a more long term approach. The way the UK does when it comes to stopping drinking and driving and smoking. Hard hitting ads, NGOs and youth groups that spread awareness, large alcohol free zones that makes drinking inconvenient and etc.

At this point it's a societal issue and not something that can be solved by higher taxes.","1420070494"

Yes. Try it:

    {

Things that could help you in the mean time just to help be extra sure (these only apply to urine sample testing):

1) don't smoke pot until you've passed the test. (Duh)

2) Work out. With a focus on cardio. This helps burn fat that thc could be stored in. I don't know if it actually will make much of a difference however doing cardio was never a bad thing anyway. 

3) Drink a lot of water. Just like the cardio this may help flush your system. And if not you'll at least be hydrated. 

4) Drink and obscene amount of water on the day of the test. Most urine test measure the amount of toxins within the urine. Over a certain threshold it what triggers a failure. By drinking more water you effectively delude your urine. It's kinda like if you were to half the cup up with water before you pee in it. (Don't fill the cup with water tho.

He was either living there for decades before being appointed by the Southern Tribe, or he was probably appointed head chief of the Southern Tribe by the Northern Chief (his father), since he was next in line to get the head chief of the Northern Tribe, as the result of the banish (too keep the ""royal bloodline"" in power or to keep the snafu from making press).

F2P MMOs with cash shops make really inconsistent money, as some months people will drop $100+ in a cash shop, while they may not spend any more money in a cash shop for the next year or two after that. That inconsistency usually leads to cash shop based MMOs having lower man-power for creating new content, and they usually work on content that is faster to create/put out, as they can't get involved with long projects if they can't assure that they can cover the costs through in-game shop purchases alone. 

This is of course a little different in buy-to-play games, but still sort of fits, as you see games like GW2 that use that model focus many of their updates on their bi-weekly small content releases and weekly additions/sales in their in-game shop to bring in money.","1420070506"

Boyhood and Birdman were both incredibly innovative and well-made movies that deserve solid spots on any list, and I though Whiplash and Nightcrawler were both great as well.

Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better.

TL;DR Ward won't be a ""Super Villain"", he will finally try to give Skye some distance and God knows where that will take him","1420070510"

Note TPS takes place BETWEEN 1 and 2, meaning that TPS happened after the events of Knox. The story with Athena tied up about to get shot, which takes place after BL2. Lillith is angry at Athena for supporting Jack, causing the death of many, many people (Roland cough cough) but this kind of does not explain the plot hole with claptrap. If he is the one we play in TPS how come Lilith doesnt shut him down or kill him because he ""supported jack"" but whatever, the other two characters staying with Jack does support the story.

Edit. Made a mistake on the name of RAD.

For example, the Carnegie institute has received millions to fund the science center, museums, and other facilities.

CMUs current endowment is like 1.9bn. More than the tax has brought in since its inception.


The group that funds the stadium authority, the group that uses our taxes to build hundred million dollar staduims for the Rooneys and the like also have received an obscene amount of money so they wouldn't have to pay out of pocket or get loans for there own stuff.

Remember how the pirates said they wouldn't be able to stay in Pittsburgh if we didn't pay for PNC park?

Red tories, from my perspective, arrived in the post war period when we had a general belief that there was a failure of capitalism that caused the depression, and that an activist government, with economic policy based on Keynesian economic models, was essential to ensure a prosperous country. 
Things have changed, and since the late 80's the emphasis has been on shrinking government, and reducing taxes on business and capital.  These are the ideas associated with Reganonmics, and neo-liberalism, and that underpin the current CPC. 
Red tories have no place in what people want in government these days, and have gone the way of the dodo, or at least, faded into the background. ","1420070517"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Not guaranteed,  by written law.  However,  judges, unless complete idiots,  would never grant custody, even partial,  to a rapist.   Many states do have specific laws revoking custody from rapists.  However I'm pretty sure those require a conviction.   Though frankly, as the law sits,  they're not a rapist if not found guilty.   

The problems with custody and child support involving ""rape"" where the offender is granted parental rights of support or custody,  isn't actual rape but statutory rape,  these cases are under a slightly different color of law,  as the offender and victim are not necessarily risk laden when it comes to the welfare of the child.  Even though if convicted they'd likely dissolve any parental rights anyhow.   Ultimately this particular matter isn't one of regular concern,  or even of minor concern.   At very worst,  the rape victim will have to fight the custody in court, which can be a pain in the ass,  plus a traumatic bit considering their rapist is the plaintiff.   But to be actually awarded custody for their efforts,  I'm not sure a case as such even exists in the US (statutory rape excluded) and if it does, it's exceedingly rare.  ","1420070521"

They aren't saying that cups are awful, just that they might not be perfect in this situation because of infection et c., and saying that that's the fault of dirty hands rather than an innate problem with a cup just doesn't seem like a relevant point to be raising.

I only ever play games when I feel like it and whenever I should start farming or regularly participating in guild events I don't want to and I'd risk getting burned out, I just stop. I am playing since the release, but I don't think I ever played for longer than 3 months without a break. This is not meant to be one of the *""I play regularly since launch but lately it's more difficult for me to keep logging in, please help me""* threads.

And when I am playing it, it isn't simply because I hope it will get better. As I said, I do like the game quite a bit, after all I have played for 1500 hours. I may have nostalgic thoughts about GW1 but I very much remember that game wasn't perfect either. I watched GW2's development very closely and then I had a lot of fun playing it.

But as time goes on and the game stagnates, it starts to feel like wasted potential. The base for an amazing game is there, but it doesn't grow, it doesn't evolve, which not only is to be expected of an MMO, but is somewhat in contradiction with the original manifesto.

More than anything, it is disconcerting to me to see the franchise fade away due to neglect. I still do think they are actively working on something actually big, but so did I a year ago and in the meantime there were no signs it is actually the case.","1420070531"

This probably won't answer your question in regards to ""whats best"" but it really is a personal choice. It depends on what you plan on doing, what works for your budget, if you actually plan on moving it places etc. For example, you may want a more expensive Singer but ask yourself if you really plan on using *all* the stitches.  If meh, then go with something else. It's not really ""what's better"" but what you plan on actually using it for. Why bother spending extra cash if you aren't going to use all the settings?

If your looking for ""Rolls Royce"" and don't care whether your going to use it for it's full potential, then go with Bernina or Viking. I have a Bernina for the weird stitches, far out quilting, appliques and it stays put. The Singer I have is a low-end 120.00 model which I actually love.

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","&gt;Do you believe that social equity is particularly lacking in video games, as opposed to other forms of media and/or art? If so, in what ways?

I think that video games as a whole, when you count mobile and indie games, is incredibly diverse. The areas where they are lacking are generally those with large budgets since developers tend appeal to the largest groups. It's not really any different from television and movies in that respect. The main difference is that the demographics in video games are much more young/male than movies so the video games which get made will reflect that.

&gt;Do you believe that video games are a medium via which social values should be progressed? If so, how so? If not, why not?

Yes. I definitely think games can carry and deliver social values. And not only that, these games already exist. Many tend to be critiques of video games and video game culture rather than society at large. (See [AVGM](http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.com/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.html), [Cow Clicker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_Clicker), [Spec Ops: The Line](http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3590430/dont-be-a-hero-the-full-story-behind-spec-ops-the-line), etc). As more people get on board with the idea and start buying such games more such games will be made.

&gt; What is your opinion of the presence of social equity in video games over the lifetime of video gaming? Have things gotten better or worse, and what games or characters make you feel this?

The stories have gotten better and the characters are more interesting than before. The capacity for games to create and express such stories has grown because platform(s) that allow for distribution have grown large enough to have an audience for these games and the technology out there allows for developers to focus more on fleshing out the game rather than debugging code.","1420070535"

At this point though, Hatred has stopped being ""a random game"" like all those indie platformers, this is a game that the Internet saw an interest in, that caused a huge controversy with people from Epic Games to Valve intervening, these sites telling me the game isn't relevant NOW when it was two weeks ago while getting nuked off Steam, just tells us more about them, that they care more about the controversies than the actual games

Judgement call in the field, with an arrest and blood test if the officer feels there is impairment. Then let a jury decide.

I understand the siren song of removing individual judgement from the process, but it causes a lot of collateral damage.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I don't interpret it the same way you do.  

You seem to think that men have this idea that femininity is bad, but I see it more as femininity implies lack of masculinity, which is bad (for men). Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.  

I'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase ""you throw like a girl"" is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to ""you don't throw like a boy.""  
  

I don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.  

As far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.  

It's all very silly, but things like this always are. I try to avoid those mindsets but none of us are immune from it. We're all just trying to find our way in a world filled with people telling us how to do it.","1420070544"

And a lot of them were literally preyed upon by multi-billion dollar companies with legions of lawyers.  It's not as much of an excuse as it is a ruing of what we the people have allowed to happen to our kids.

I have a friend that went to school in the late 80ies and he was told by his school aid counselors that he had no access to work study or grants and had to take loans to finish his degree.  He was clueless what the consequences were as he'd never even had a credit card to that point.

As it turned out, the very counselors tasked with helping him were found to have taken kick back by the loan corporations and they lied to him about the grants.  He should have been given approximately 85% grants and would be facing a fraction of the debt he ended up with.

This is what we are doing to our kids, opening up the door to literal financial predators.  Our kids, our children.

Any rights NOT specifically listed here belong to the states or the people"". So what's to stop a state from limiting (for example) my freedom of religion?  Since it also says ""...nor prohibited by it to the states..."", the BoR could be construed as saying ""Yeah, all other powers go to the states, but even the states can't touch these enumerated rights"".

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Consider a sequence of functions that converges pointwise to the step function f(x)=0 for x&lt;=0, f(x)=1 for x&gt;0 on [-1,1]. For example, fn(x)=max(0,min(1,nx)). For n&gt;m&gt;N you have fn and fm agree except on (0,1/m), and |fn(x)-fm(x)|&lt;=1, so

d(fn,fm) &lt;= 1/m &lt; 1/N

That gives you Cauchy convergence. 

Can you see how to show that sequence can't converge to any f in C[0,1] by considering an interval around 0 where f is close to f(0)?

His defense was always predicated on a bend don't break mentality so there weren't a lot of blitzes. In 2011, it worked because we had an amazing line that could get pressure while only rushing 4. This year he should have blitzed more in my opinion because we weren't getting a ton of pressure rushing 4 which gave Qb's time to pick apart our depleted secondary. So while it wasn't his fault that we had a lot of injuries it was his fault that we didn't adjust our scheme to try and cover up those injuries.

Congrats on your tv, looks nice. According to http://www.lg.com/ca_en/tvs/lg-42LH40-lcd-tv you have two possible outputs: the headphone jack and optical digital (spdif). Your speaker jacks are as follows.


Color | Channel
---|---
Green | Front l and r
Orange | sub and center
Black | Surround l and r
  

1- the easy solution (cheap and fast)

**Headphone jack**, and that will plug into the **lime green** connector, that will allow you to use your 2 satelites. Probably you could get the sub and center to work via some mode on the speakers where center is the average of the two and sub is the low frequency sum of the two signals.

2- Harder solution, but better:

You may find a toslink to 3.5 mm converter like this [Converter](https://sewelldirect.com/Sewell-51-DTSDolby-Digital-to-Analog-Converter-35mm-Output.asp)

Connect it to the optical out in the back of your LCD and then enjoy. It'll set you back 65$ though.","1420070548"

That could be the explanation, so it must be the explanation? Does that really work? Imagine if someone proposed this for any other experience billions of people had. ""They could all be hallucinating when they saw that solar eclipse. People do hallucinate after all."" Moreover, this argument never goes away no matter what happens. Even if Jesus shows up tomorrow and God projects his voice across the Earth in all languages and everyone remembers it, it's still technically possible that we all hallucinated. That's absolutely not a reason for us to think that's true though. If we disregard experiences just because we don't agree with their implications or findings, we're almost guaranteed to be wrong about something.

&gt;If there were modern polytheists, they could just do what modern christian apologists do and change their arguments, discarding ancient ones that we've shown false -- like most christians do with a lot of the old testament.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","&gt;But, looking past the naming convention, we already have the bulldog repeater and the name bulldog doesn't represent a long range fighter very well, which is the primary attribute of the deep space fighter.

So, in other words, ignoring your primary argument, which you have been continuing to argue in this thread despite the lack of evidence supporting it (IMO).

Whether or not the name fits the purpose is a matter of opinion. I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well.

There already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)).

IDK, overall I like the name. I see valid reasons to change it and equally valid reasons to keep it, I wouldn't be opposed to either outcome. CIG will do what they think is best and I'll be happy with it.","1420070561"

-Spend 8 months building a team

-Night before the tournament, go on nuggetbridge, ask for my entire team shiny and flawless

-Trade it all from the generous people of nuggetbridge who have RNGd 100s of pokemon that people want

-EV train

-Go to the tournament where everyone in the Top 20 does literally the exact same thing

A dupe? They're no different than any other pokemon? They're not illegal, they're obtained completely legitemately. If they were hacked then I'm pretty sure VGC will make Ray Rizzo give back his 3 world championship trophies because he literally does the exact same thing. I literally got my Cresselia from him the day of our tournament. Then what, do they give it to the person who placed the highest at worlds who didn't RNG? Too bad everybody at Worlds RNGs or obtains their mons from their friend that RNGs. Do some research. RNG is not cheating, if it were, it'd be banned, wouldn't it?","1420070564"

Do you still live with them? If not then stand up, tell them in a sentence or two that you have already explained yourself and refuse to do so over and over, and that the decision has been made. 

If they persist? Leave. Walk out of the house and go back home. Ignore any anger they might send in text messages, and don't answer phone calls from them. Then, put in an email the reasons why their pushing upsets you. Reiterate in the email that you refuse to engage in the conversation again if they bring it up, and you will simply leave again.

After that, steel yourself. They'll kick off and accuse you of disrespect and childishness for not having the conversation. Weather it and don't respond. They'll run out of steam with no response.

After that, resume contact with them on other issues, but stay firm in your decision that the childfree conversation is done. Do not ever engage in it again. Eventually they'll get the message.

It's not normal and you guys need to go trough that shit together, if you think he's worth it.

Either he has emotional scars or he's fucking with you. But I'm sure there are a lot of guys out there (even those who seem confident, who look attractive, seem to lead a successful life etc. etc.) who have issues with their self esteem and with their past.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Yeah except that sub *is* the redpill. It doesn't have a several thousand year history, like Atheism. It came into existence here on the internet, and those screenshots include endorsed contributers. Make all the excuses you want, what the redpill is actually about is very very obvious.

The redpill is an excuse to shift the blame for romantic failures from the redpillers to the women they failed to attract, by turning women into the enemy. It tells boys that it's not *their* fault, it's the fault of the woman who are inherently out to get men and who only care about their status and the contents of their wallets. Then it feeds them a bunch of lies and pseudoscience and rehashed conservative values (women cheat! women want older men! women won't respect you! women are only valuable while young and naive!) while totally failing to tell them what healthy relationships are like. 

Even the core idea is a cognitive dissonance: Women occupy all of their mental real estate and they twist and contort themselves to get their attention, engaging in elaborate plots and acting out scripts and making pretty much their entire life about ""bettering"" themselves so that women will want them. Then they claim that they have found a revelation about how not to be controlled by women. Yeah right. Making yourself into a guard doesn't get you out of jail, it just makes you the slave of the inmates because now everything you do is about keeping them in. 

It's a toxic outlook that dooms anyone who follows it to a lonely future of hostile and antagonistic relationships while causing massive amounts of incidental harm to the women they date and any children unfortunate enough to be born to them. 

It doesn't even work to pick up women. Anyone who approaches lots of women will eventually find one who is willing to stick around. Fools attribute their ""success"" to the redpill when really it's just that even horrible people with no redeeming qualities can get a SO. The world is full of examples, which they ignore. And when they do get into a relationship, it's generally with someone horrible, because they are looking for the stupid superficial things the redpill told them to look for, and ignoring red flags left right and center. Self fulfilling prophecy - if you expect women to be evil and materialistic and manipulative you don't blink when you find one that acts that way - and she *will* date you because she's used to men running for the hills when they figure out what she is. 

So yeah, have fun defending the redpill. Be another sucker who falls for something cooked up by people who hate women as an excuse to hate women more, and let them keep ruining your life. Bye.

You all need to protest, scream, yell, and do everything possible to cause a commotion. Every support group does, but the Third Rail needs to be the leader on this. There is going to be a lockout, and it is going to be ugly, but once it is over, the fans in this league need to send a goddamn message that **this bullshit cannot, will not, and will never be acceptable**.

This needs to be Garber's Watergate, Lewinsky, and Teapot Dome all in one. He needs to be gone. He is hurting the league, and we need to send the message to our owners that Garber cannot continue as commissioner.  This needs to be a coordinated effort, and I believe the Third Rail needs to be the leader of it.","1420070569"

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","You and I, we got similar fit issues. I also need a very rounded bottom cup. I have found that bras from the Eveden brands (Freya, Fantasie, Fauve, Elomi, Goddess) tend to have a more rounded bottom than Panache. 

I would thus encourage you to try more Elomi bras. Fauve in 36GG too if you can get your hands on them. Fantasie is made for a more even shape, Freya will most likely be too narrow and demand more volume on top than you currently have. 

Bravissimo also has that rounded bottom in the majority of their bras, thus my recommendation for them. 

As for Cleos - try them in your correct size or it will be difficult to judge fit. In a too wide band it is hard to swoop and scoop correctly. 

You could probably get Cleo Lucy to fit you if you tried it in 34H/HH and altered the gore. It is possible to sew the gore narrower and in many cases this changes the fit of the Lucy from ""horrible"" to ""best bra ever"".

Additionally your breasts will change over the next year or so. They will become more even and you will need less volume in the bottom and more volume on top. Their basic shape will not change, but you will have an easier time fitting into bras that were a total desaster before. ","1420070570"

I'm also in college and I am lucky enough to have a job that pays me enough to get to and from tournaments and also compete in them. I own a Modern deck that I am quite good at playing so I don't have to worry about that and I recently used the money from placing at the SCG Worcester Premier IQ to purchase the GB Constellation shell and the Jeskai shell so I can play either of those in standard or sell them off to play a different deck. 

Im very lucky to be in a situation where I can do this but there are still budgetary limits and im not above trying to bum a hotel room floor or sleeping in the car but I haven't had to do that yet. I don't splurge on material goods, I don't eat out, I don't spend money on things that aren't Magic unless I need to do something like car repair. 

Competitive Magic needs to be a big priority I think if you want to do it. I still value my personal life and my girlfriend as well as my school work over Magic but at this point in my life I'm lucky enough to not have to worry about paying bills and maintaining a home or anything like that thanks to dorm life.

I guess I was under the misconception that knighthood was originally awarded for chivalric purposes such as bravery in battle and that kind of thing, which made it even more confusing for me to see how it's so often been given to celebrities lately. This thread has helped me understand the difference. However, I feel that maybe they're given out too easily lately? But I can see why people such as Sir Elton John are given a knighthood, for his lifelong, inspiring work in music.

Does it happen often that when a new monarch ascends to the throne that knighthoods are taken away if say, the new monarch does not agree with or like some people previously knighted?

There are many reasons why the US prison rate is so high but one of the main reasons is because they become institutionalized by being withdrawn from what goes on outside.

Technically the only jobs that a criminal record stop you from doing is working in the police force and prison service.

Seems reasonable to me - Sarah has purposely shown us a pretty unpolished persona on this show (being willing to show anxiety, for instance) and it's probably fairly genuine.

Also, I think Jay is someone who uses language creatively, and it doesn't serve us well to parse it and want it to be precise. It's not. I've known guys like that. It's frustrating, but it's easier when you accept that they don't see language as requiring precision.","1420070578"

Documentation.

Remember, when this is all said and done you want to make sure that everything is documented. Every lie the media told, every inaccuracy that was peddled as ""truth"", every misappropriated label and narrative paradigm that they pushed onto the public -- it all needs to be documented. 

A lot of this is for red-pilling neutrals. If they go to Google and type in ""GamerGate right-wing"", they'll get slapped in the face with the truth.

The thing is, there are a couple of other parables where servants are rewarded for building up riches, so we need to look at the totality of the scripture when it comes to these things.

"Android","t5_2qlqh"," 1. Why did you choose Android or iOS? 

Back in 2010, when I was looking to upgrade from my Blackberry, I wanted a smartphone, but iPhone was only on AT&amp;T, a carrier with which I had had horrible experiences with.    But Verizon was showing off this neat ""Droid"" Incredible phone.   I got it, it worked great, from what I could see, it was as good as an iPhone with few gaps.   It even had built-in voice turn-by-turn navigation, something that iOS wouldn't have for years.  

Since then, I've just continued to use Android mostly because I *really* use all the Android features, things like NFC, Google Wallet, automation with Tasker, swipe typing, etc. so going to iOS would always seem like a downgrade.   I simply am not willing to lose function I've come to depend upon.    I will say that iOS has done a good job in catching up, particularly with iOS 8,  but there are still things that are lacking.  

I'll also caveat this by saying that I do use an iPad for work and I do think that iOS has done tablets pretty well, better than Android mostly because I don't tend to use all those advanced functions when using a tablet.     But the first thing I did on the iPad was to sweep all the Apple stuff into a folder and populate my home screen with Google stuff instead.   I'm deeply invested in the Googleverse, so having Google be a first class player on any device is important to me. 

       2. What are some things you envy about the opposite platform?

I like the way that iMessage works smoothly.   I'd really like for Hangouts to get to that level.   I'd also like for Google Music to offer the breadth of music you can find on iTunes.   Also, as I said before, I'd like for Android's tablets to be better.   I think they came very close with the Nexus 7.   I like mine (a 2012 3G model that so far is still waiting for Lollipop).   But it is sluggish now.   Very different from my iPad.    Finally, I'd like Google to enforce a little more uniformity in its hardware so that we can see a better 3rd party market for things like mounts, cases, etc.  


       3. What can you do on your platform that is easier or does not exist on the opposite platform?

Google Now voice integration and Moto X's features like the wave to see notifications/time and hands free ""OK Moto"" search are great.   So is 4K video capture.    But I still go back to the basics:   Google's intents system is so advanced compared to iOS' nascient extensions.    To see what I mean, use Google Now to say ""Play music by Trans Siberian Orchestra"".    When Google responds, you can just let it play with the default player (Google Music on my phone) *or* you can choose *another* music player that's on your phone, like tuneIn radio,  Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, etc.   You simply cannot do that on iOS and it drives me crazy, especially since I generally use cloud-based music all the time, either Spotify or Google Music.   So if I tell  ""Play Trans Siberian Orchestra""  to Siri, it whines about the fact that I don't have their music on my device instead of maybe bringing up Spotify.  

That plus automation.   I love that you can use things like Tasker to do crazy things like push programmable actions from your phone to Chromecast or automate certain settings based on time of day, location, or wifi network name.

"Nootropics","t5_2r81c","I don't take Piracetam, but did I try noopept which is similar but more powerful (and therefore requires a much smaller dose for the same effect). The immediate effects on my clarity, focus, and mental energy were moderate, but noticeable, very similar to taking a blood-brain barrier crossing choline supplement like Alpha-GPC. This is due to the tams (and noopept) doing basically the same thing as a choline supplement (increasing choline in your brain), just in a different way; dosing choline will give it to you semi-immediately, after it is absorbed into your blood and passes the b-b barrier, while the tams increase your natural choline production temporarily. There are, of course, many differences in brain chemistry between people (namely their cholinergic systems), with different rate-limiters and impacts based on presence of other chemicals. Whenever I test a new chemical, I look for the following things in order:

1) Research indicating long term positive effects. Because it's extremely difficult to self-measures over long periods, this is really your only option.

2) Test a small dosage at the lower range and look for any immediate effects, positive or negative. Note all of them.

3) Continuing testing with increasing dosages if test 2 was, at the very least, not negative. Continue doing so until a reasonable upper limit on intake is reached (based on research and your own experience with similar chemicals). If there's any negative effects, evaluate if using the substance is worth having that side effect.

If there's no research to indicate long term effects and no immediate benefit at upper intake levels, it's probably a dud for you and you should move onto better things, and not waste your money. If there's an immediate positive effect, take it as long as you feel safe and have the money to do so. If there's a long term positive benefit but no immediate effect, weigh the long term effect against the long term effects of other potential nootropics you can purchase with the same money, and purchase as many long term supplements as your budget will allow.

Hah, I wrote a lot of words tangentially related to your post. Hopefully it helps you with your Piracetam tests and future nootropic tests.","1420070589"

"Frozen","t5_2vpth","&gt; I see, I think I would like it as long as they don't make Hans the main villain of the show or something, in all honestly if they did a spin off I would prefer if they mostly left Hans aside. He was the worst thing about the Frozen season IMO, even though I don't hate him in the movie and the actor did a great job.

I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again.  It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king.

&gt; yet the OUAT fandom liked more Elsa, deeming that Anna was too goofy at times.

I didn't get that at all.  I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc.

&gt; Perhaps, In the end I just hope they don't drown us on this kind of stuff, more Frozen is good but becoming like the SW AU that no one but the most hardcore could follow due the extensive material there was would be overwhelming.

I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon.  The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.","1420070593"

Dragons breath has a couple problems:

Solar flare sucks. It doesn't do amazing damage and enemies and bosses will go above and beyond to go away from them.

Triple tube gives 6 shots total, which is extra heavy ammo, which is rip if you die and then the ever so fun bug takes it away.

No tracking is a problem, it saves so many shots on the horn. Dragonsbreath also kept shooting right through omnigul where as gjallarhorn would always detonate","1420070598"

"PersonOfInterest","t5_2sd8v","I think the wanting to protect the Machine was made apparent pretty much from the start. Root actually said something to the effect that she's bored and disappointed in people and wants to set the Machine free in her first (or maybe second) episode as Root. And I believed her. But that didn't mean she wasn't a danger to the team.

I'm surprised though that it's annoying/disturbing for some people (I've seen some comments like that before too) that Root calls the Machine “she”. My take is that it would be strange if Root called the Machine “it”. I would guess that people who are annoyed by the “she” maybe don't like Root's character that much in the first place, because calling the Machine “she” is very much in line with Root's development and motivations. 

Root has allowed herself to be molded (and in some ways healed) by the Machine and she has made it obvious that not only is she willing to die for the Machine but she pretty much experts that that'll happen, Root has insisted the Machine cares etc. So if Root would call the Machine an “it” that would be like saying Root would knowingly revise her principles and sacrifice herself for a can of chicken soup and the chicken soup would appreciate it. People might compromise or risk whatever for gold or food etc, but then it's about greed or survival and that's not the deal with Root and the Machine.","1420070600"

&gt;What unites us is far greater than what divides us. The issues and irritants that inevitably affect all neighbors are small deed in comparison with the issues that we face together--above all the somber threat now posed to the whole neighborhood of this continent--in fact, to the whole community of nations. But our alliance is born, not of fear, but of hope. It is an alliance that advances what we are for, as well as opposes what we are against.

3. Various reports, usually.  We need to account for all the money spent.  We need to address the promises we made in the grant: we will measure scores on state assessments before and after, gpa, attendance, etc., anything we claimed we would measure in the proposal.  Some larger grants require attendance at a conference to present results and the travel for this conference must be explicitly budgeted.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes. As someone who read the Quran, it is not even compatible with any kind of humanity.
For example, Quran orders you to kill any non believer unless it is Ramadan. Orders beheadings, to be specific.
It tells you to beat your wife if she does not listen to you.
It ables you to have 4 wives and **limitless** slaves for sexual purposes or for other purposes.

But even if we ignore all these facts, because there are certain laws in Quran, and all muslims have to abide by these laws, man-made laws thus democracy or american laws are forbidden for muslims. In other words, every muslims who chooses to live in any country other than countries governed by sharia, are committing a sin.

So... how about the [2001 Miami Hurricanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team#Starting_lineup) VS the [2000 San Diego Chargers](http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/san-diego-chargers/roster/2000?sort=pos). I would have picked the only 0-16 team, the 2008 Lions, but I feel like all they'd need to do is air it up to Megatron against a college team and they'd be putting points up.

This Chargers team? They've got Seau and Rodney Harrison on D and as far as I can tell everyone else on the roster is either unknown or known to be terrible. I feel like the Canes would at least have a chance with... Clinton Portis, Jeremy Shockey, Andre Johnson, Najeh Davenport and 4 offensive lineman that went on to play in the NFL(with the other starter having a career in the CFL). On Defense, every single starter except for 1 went on to play in the NFL, most of them being high draft picks.

If we could time travel these 2 teams to the Rose Bowl to play against each other with, say 2 weeks to prepare for the game... I really think it's at least a 50/50 shot for Miami to wint, if not in their favor.","1420070616"

the profile itself is well written-i think it would appeal to the type of woman you seem to be into, ie cerebral women, and i was honestly surprised we have a really low match percentage. i looked over our unacceptable answers and they seem mostly lifestyle related. i am one of the people you mention who are a bit weirded out by men who say they wouldn't mind or would like to date a virgin, so both of those related questions were highlighted pink. i can't articulate exactly why the idea squicks me out...maybe it seems like it would have to be a huge age gap? or someone who was very naive? i don't know, but something about it doesn't sit well with me.

On top of that, CSU has an amazing engineering program that you should check out, and has just absurd amounts of climbing nearby, ranging from 10 minutes drive up to Horsetooth for bouldering, or 35 minutes up the Poudre Canyon for some sport climbing, or any of the remaining climbing that just covers CO/the whole western US.","1420070616"

I guess my point with this comment as was the point with the post as a whole is....shit, things are happening to me, I dunno what I'm becoming, but I ain't normal and I refuse to fully reassimilate with such routine-based individuals.  I'd rather be forced to listen to Nickelback remixed with Skrillex forever than be told I can never have more than 3 drinks or I can never take my last Adderall dosage no later than 6 hours before bed.

"bash","t5_2qh2d","So, I can try to explain it to the best of my abilities, but I am sure some gray beard Unix wiz will correct me.

Using sed, with 's' will evaluate the string you pipe it into and substitute the value in order.  So, in my very simple solution sed 's/,//2' is going to evaluate all commas, and substitute nothing for them, in the second instance.   Now, had my command been this:

    echo $string | sed 's/,//g'

That would have substituted all commas globally in the entire string.  However, we only wanted to strip out the second one.   If we wanted to change the second comma to say a colon we could change sed to this syntax:

    echo $string | sed 's/,/:/2'

Also, in sed, the froward slashes are just delimiters (lack of a better word) for the substitution going on, you can replace them with other characters like asterisks in the event you want to substitute slashes like so:

    echo $string | sed 's*,**2'

So, I am assuming that CSV is some sort of inventory sheet for Dell monitors, so assuming all the data you want to edit is in the same format we can assume that the second comma is the one you want replaced.   You would need to loop through every line in the CSV and then modify it to a new CSV sort of like you have already posted an example of.","1420070623"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","&gt;That does not stop you from labeling anyone who does not accept your interpretation of his motives and methods as ""schismatic and worthless"".

No, I called one *article* ""schismatic and worthless"" as well as a couple other words.  I didn't do that to this article.  I had one historical objection (the ""bridge too far"" reference) and some disagreement with the author over word choice.  The article from Weigel is neither schismatic nor worthless, and I called it ""a worthwhile read.""  

&gt;He is not a man of tradition at all. An understanding of his papacy will stand on its own outside of the context of dead European popes

I disagree.  There is much of the Church's tradition of concern for social justice issues that Francis has incorporated into his own outlook.  There is also a great deal of the theology of John Paul II and Benedict XVI by Francis' own admission (*Evangeli Gaudium*, sections 7, 112, 123, 198, and 272 for Benedict XVI, and sections 15, 27, 32, 40, and 110 for John Paul II.  You’ll also find a reference to Pius XI in section 205, as well as John XXIII in 41 and 84.  And that’s just the direct references in just one document) .  Of course Francis is new.  So was Benedict XVI.  So was John Paul II.  So was every pontiff before all of them.  But there is no divorce between Francis and ""dead European popes.""  On the issue of social justice, reading Francis without the context of previous papal statements on that subject will lead to an incomplete understanding of Francis.  

I invite everyone to read the social justice encyclicals, then to re-read Francis’ statements, then to judge for themselves.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I get the feeling you've never done customer support, much less for one in a large call center environment for a faceless corporation.

1.  Comcast likely outsources the support to another company or companies.  Usually companies diversify their support so that differently owned call centers are directly competing with others so they don't get complacent.  They can look at reports and say X call center is doing better than Y, let's give a higher percent of the call volume to X.  How well a call center does as a whole directly impacts job security.  So to say comcast hired the person, it might be true if comcast is the one doing the support, but I'd be pretty skeptical that they do.  Generally, if comcast is outsourcing, they aren't equipped to deal with some random employee of a company they outsource work to in an individual basis.  You don't see the outliers when all the data has been averaged.

2.  Customers call in wanting free stuff all the time.  I mean all the fucking time.  They will have all sorts of creative stories that may or may not be true, claiming previous agents told them they'd get free this or that, usually things that cannot ever be promised.  And even if the customer is telling the truth that an agent told them that, the agent will carefully omit that from their case notes to bring less attention to themselves should the customer call back.  The only way they'd get caught is if the call was randomly picked to get reviewed.  The 2nd agent is only going to have the customer's word vs. the previous agent's notes, which may not confirm what the customer is claiming is accurate.  Now in this case, he has it recorded, but does that truly prove to her that he didn't have a friend record it with him?  At any rate, if she isn't supposed to do it, it's not worth risking her job over satisfying one customer.  In her mind, do you think she cares more about his $12 a month than her own job security?  Absolutely not.

3.  She many not even be capable of offering what he's claiming.  I've had to deal with people who were promised things we cannot do and I couldn't fulfill them either.  And that's not a case of ""well get your supervisor to do it.""  I was the supervisor.  The next level above me was escalated cases and there was a specific guideline for what gets escalated.  A customer supposedly being promised something we literally cannot do was not a valid escalation scenario.  Before you say ""well escalate it anyway and let them handle it"" it doesn't work like that.  Knowingly escalating an invalid case too often gives more back-end work to the team that handles those, which end up de-escalated anyway as invalid.  They don't even get to see the case as the team that approves it would flag it.  Too many invalid escalations can result in a corrective action form (getting written up).  Getting 2 CAFs in 6 months would lead to the agent being terminated.

4.  Within the context of the company I worked for, giving something away for free was called empowerment.  It was doing something outside the normal policy to keep the customer happy and we had limited scope of what we could use it for.  This generally required approval (as a supervisor I didn't need external approval) and was tracked as a percentage of how many calls where you gave away empowerment.  The goal was to not exceed 3% per month and anything over 5% would get investigated into.  So if I legitimately had 20 calls where 2 people had a valid reason for receiving compensation from us for an issue that is on our end, it would've been in my best interest to only give it to 1, and in most cases that tends to be the first person not the second one.

5. Playing back the previous recording was likely a bad choice on his part.  That will flag the new agent that he's likely recording her call as well, and she's going to do everything by the books.  She can't get in trouble for denying him the 12 month promotion if that's what her documents/policies tell her to do.

You try to boil it down to ""well comcast is obligated to follow through with it"" but it's never that simple.  The more likely outcome is the agent that handled the first call will get written up or fired.  And now that it's gone viral to a degree, comcast may try to make it right.  For the average customer though, their call isn't going to go viral, and there are too many degrees of separation to get approval to make it right (or you have no proof the customer is telling the truth, so you err on the side of caution by denying them).  There are just so many factors at play here that someone who hasn't done customer support will be completely oblivious to.","1420070625"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Sure, you can. But they generally go a lot better if you're partaking as well. It probably doesn't make sense from a pure cash outflow analysis now, but for me it goes into greater relationship building that ends up directly affecting my salary. There's something to be said for the social effect alcohol has on building relationships. I have to deal with my boss in a very professional manner 95% of the time I'm around him, but he's good about cutting back and building our relationship personally when he takes us out to bars. This ends up affecting how we interact when we're back at the office. If he generally likes me as a person outside of work, it makes dealing with the things that come up inside work a lot easier, and usually translates into him being more willing to invest time into teaching me which helps me perform better and meet his expectations more easily.

Yes, for client expenses it's always covered. At training events with my peers it's more hit or miss. At this stage in my career, it's an expense I don't mind having.

But I have to say the community seems a bit crazy sometimes. I mean, ""you can smoke everywhere! It's just steam it can't harm anybody!""... What bollocks. Your lungs don't absorb everything. Of course there will be nicotine in whatever you blow out. Or all the other things that might be in there. I also don't get the ""you can smoke everywhere!"" part. Yes, it might not be as dangerous and cigarettes but like I said, there's still nicotine. And not everybody wants to have somebody blowing stuff into their face around. And people might get uncomfortable with people around them ""smoking"" even if it's not real smoke.

And what's up with the ""no regulation hurp durp!"" stuff? Wouldn't you want the government to enforce standards? 

Anyway, what you posted seems very reasonable. I would not smoke it inside anyway, nicotine is still not harmless and it's pretty stupid calling a product ""healthy"" if they don't even know the long term affects.

Edit: Something that's probably interesting from your link here, I know a lot of people that only smoked shisha but once they stopped that, they started to smoke cigarettes. So the nicotine might get some younger people hooked and once they drop the e cigarette for whatever reason, they might start smoking proper cigarettes because they're easier to get.","1420070637"

&gt;You didn't ask for that. You asked for ""more evidence and rhetoric"" not a source for present evidence. You don't get to change the rules of debate as you go along. You also fail to address the crux of my argument, which is your complete disregard for basic economics principles like ceteris paribus and the law of demand.

When I asked for more evidence and rhetoric, I was indeed asking for present evidence. Some sort of scientific study or article along with some more persuasive commentary possibly would have changed my mind about the issue.

&gt;Can you give me a source that Japanese people follow formal legality more than they follow the law of demand?

Certainly, there is a huge demand for electronics in Japan as Japan has the largest electronics industry in the world. Though this demand is present, looting and theft are practically nonexistent. During the Fukushima tsunami crisis, looting was not even on the radar. Contrast this with Europe and America where looting is always going to be a problem.

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2011/03/stop_thief_thank_you.html

&gt;I don't follow your rhetoric that somehow Asian countries are all the same and frankly I find it racist.

I wouldn't suggest that all Asian countries are the same, however I believe it is negligent to suggest that they are too different to compare. Japan and China share a lot of cultural heritage.

&gt;No. The state is a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence formed through concentration of armed force in the body of the sovereign for the express purpose of relieving humanity of its purportedly unselfmanaging nature. The formation of sovereign bodies has hitherto been performed through hierarchical striation along the boundaries of class dictatorships. States serve the good of those bodies that constitute the formative kingmaker class of society that can constitute itself as dictator. They do not serve everyone. This is evidenced in a myriad of ways, but since we're arguing on the internet, I figure I might as well drop the classic example of the Holocaust, wherein the state was willing to serve the general welfare of all people only inasmuch as 11+ millions of people were considered to be not people.

The state most certainly does not have a monopoly on force. In democratic countries, the sovereign of the state is the people. If the people think they are ill-governed, the people can change the government. If the government will not change then revolution is the only recourse. Many governments have been overturned through violent revolutions. Recent studies have even suggested that all it takes is 3.5% of a population to overturn a government.

http://rationalinsurgent.com/2013/11/04/my-talk-at-tedxboulder-civil-resistance-and-the-3-5-rule/

&gt;Wrong. It is not in the interest of women seeking abortions. Inasmuch as the state has a duty to prevent underpopulation, it is not best resolved by abortion. Further, there is no evidence that this will affect billions of people.

It would be in the long term interest of women seeking abortions. I am now persuaded that it would not be best resolved by prohibition, however there is good evidence that a lack of laborers will lead to an economic recession or depression, and such a depression will definitely effect billions as Japan is the third largest economy in the world.

&gt;Cereal is sold at grocery stores. Milk is sold at grocery stores, too. Grocery stores employ workers. Let's say we have ten workers who work at a grocery store that exclusively sells cereal and milk. Let's also say that this grocery store is a monopoly and therefore its sales are representative of aggregate demand for both milk and cereal in the economy where it resides. All ten of these workers handle both cereal and milk in their occupational duties. If the store were to stop selling cereal because of a government decree that cereal is causing a dangerously negative birth rate, but were to continue selling milk, the store would still be representative of the aggregate demand for milk. The workers, formerly charged with sale of both milk and cereal, now will be charged solely with the sale of milk. However, this store represents the aggregate demand. They can try to substitute milk for cereal to some extent by diverting productive resources for the sale of cereal to the sale of milk, but this effectively will serve the purpose of shifting the price of milk downwards along the demand curve while not substantially recovering the sales normally allocated to cereal. The marginal rate of substitution for milk and cereal, you see, is not perfect. To some extent, substitution falls flat. So, even though the store still sells milk, and its workers are perfectly trained and capable of selling milk, approximately half of the workers will be laid off. Abortion is cereal. Other procedures are milk. It might not be half, but to disregard potential economic effects on the basis that health care professionals have more than one function is irresponsible

I suppose it would be negligent to disregard potential economic effects of outlawing abortion. However I'm not convinced that the economic ramifications would outweigh the benefits of adding another 200,000 - 300,000 people into the economy.

&gt;Women make up (more than) half the labor force and spend their wages as (more than) half of the consumer base. There is the potential for the economy to be cut in half in a few short years.

I'm afraid I'm not convinced that out of 60 million women, a couple hundred thousand of them putting their careers on hold would cut the economy in half.

&gt;Who are you to purpose your thought as law of nature? I'll again ask why should I care what you think? I don't see any conceivable reason in the absence of all evidence, that I am making an overestimation. From this section of the response, you also ignore the potential impacts of women made infertile, dead, or prisoner by proposed measures for criminalization of abortion.

I believe you are the one who is trying to persuade me. If you don't care what I think then why are you putting so much effort into persuasion?

&gt;This is self-contradicting. It either works, doesn't work, or is inconclusive. These classifications don't overlap. What's more, if a criminalization of abortion were put into effect, the same claim could be used to unilaterally dismiss it. You lack a metric by which to evaluate the efficacy of methods but insist on the superiority of your own proposition on grounds of blind faith.

I believe that this trichotomy is really a spectrum of certainty. A point has a level of certainty which changes continuously with new information arriving. 

&gt;I'll top this off with one new argument to keep things fresh: immigration policy reform stands a far greater chance at increasing the Japanese population than criminalized abortion.

I'm afraid I have already awarded a delta for this good point.

ps: you really ought to take a course on Aristotelian rhetoric. The way you debate is quite combative and is not conducive to persuading anyone. Persuasion is really an art which comprises compelling points, interesting illustrations, inspiring dialogue, and friendly prodding among other things.","1420070638"

Think of it this way. As a good mother you want to raise strong, independent children, yes? There are some things that are age appropriate for your child to do at different milestones in their lives.

As a 7 month old your baby should be able to comfort itself if it wakes up at night and fall back asleep.

You should help him/her learn this skill because it is empowering and age appropriate.","1420070642"

 [**Pole of inaccessibility**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole%20of%20inaccessibility): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __pole of inaccessibility__ marks a location that is the most challenging to reach owing to its remoteness from [geographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography) features that could provide access. Often it refers to the most distant point from the coastline. The term describes a geographic construct, not an actual physical phenomenon. Subject to varying definitions, it is of interest mostly to [explorers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer).

For Synecdoche, especially, I'm not the kind of guy who likes hearing others' simple ""x represents y"" type interpretations. 

I'm so glad that instead you've taken your time with this, that you acknowledge that everyone forming their own interpretations is central to the movie's experience, and that you're catering to the audience that have already seen, understood, and interpreted the film and that this is instead a technical analysis of details that probably were overlooked by a large majority of people.

My only criticism is that you should probably have added a disclaimer towards the beginning for anyone that hasn't seen the movie that this video will make almost zero sense (although I'm personally happy that you're not making this one noob friendly).

"java","t5_2qhd7","Your rather defensive argument amounts to ""nobody does it that way because I haven't"" while ignoring the simple fact that your statements are objectively wrong.

&gt; Second, the commercial number of Velocity-only webapps can be counted on one hand. In 17 years as a professional developer--since 1999 on Java--I have never seen a professional organization release any view technology that was not, ultimately, based on JSP. Surely, it's technically possible to deploy something only on a Velocity front end but it's simply not done.

You've *never* seen a Java web application that *doesn't* use JSP?  I'll accept that, I've interviewed developers that have *never* used a debugger.  However your assertion that it is ""simply not done"" is flat out wrong.  Many projects do not use JSP at all and furthermore how often JSP is used isn't even relevant.  You asserted JSP is the *foundation* of *all* view technologies and it simply isn't the foundation of *any* of those view technologies.

&gt; Spring MVC--which I have deep and extensive experience with--is a Swiss army knife that can be used with many other technologies--but 99% of its uses include JSP.

If you're going to use hyperbole why don't you go all the way and claim JSP is used 100% of the time?  Heck, you already did when you claimed there aren't any Java web applications that don't use JSP in the first place.  Would you care to substantiate this rather bold assertion? 

Around here the mere suggestion that we should use JSP would likely get a rather interesting response.

&gt; So, it appears you're just trying to speak in asterisks and edge cases for the dubious point of finding exceptions to the obvious rules that I stated clearly. Every one of your ""exceptions"" the the general rules I laid out are microsopic edge cases that are never used professionally.

So you are asserting that:

1. Thymeleaf is *never* used professionally.
2. Velocity is *never* used professionally.
3. Freemarker is *never* used professionally.
4. Other non-HTML based rendering (e.g. XML, JSON, YAML) using libraries such as JAXB or Jackson (both of which Spring MVC supports out of the box) are *never* used professionally.

Seriously?

&gt; Surely, it's possible to write a Spring MVC app that writes full HTML instead of using JSP but can you suggest one professional application that does this, when the full suite of JSP-dependent technologies are right there?

To begin with I never once mentioned rendering HTML in the first place, so I'm not sure why you're attached to it.  Are you under the impression that Spring MVC only supports rendering HTML?  Perhaps you're going to claim it can but *nobody* does that either.

Last but not least, I must re-iterate, not a single one of the technologies I listed are *dependent* on JSP and not a single one of them has JSP as their *foundation*.

P.S. You may want to inform the Spring team that 9 of the 10 view technologies they support out of the box are ""never used professionally"" so as to save them the work of supporting them.","1420070646"

&gt;Would you?

No, it is a cultural and traditional thing, however I am not unhappy it was done to me. In fact, if I could go back and have a say, I'd say, ""do it while I'm young and won't remember it.""  Are there not other traditional things we do?

I go there (I'm about to head over in an hour or so), hang out and shoot pool, then when the time comes, I start hauling people home in their own car.  If they live close enough, I leave the car and walk back.  Some I take home in my car and just leave theirs at the bar.  Either way, most people give at least $20 for that, some more.  Last year I ended up making about $600 for 4 hours of DD work.

"Wicca","t5_2rgn5","&gt; You have not yet crossed my meaning, was my point.I do not believe that /r/Wicca and /r/Asatru could have a productive interfaith dialogue for reasons I've gone over in depth elsewhere; I am being specific to you, as a person.

And I'm saying that if you can have productive dialogue with me there probably aren't 5 users on all of /r/asatru who you couldn't do the same with. I am the first to admit I am one of the most difficult, the most abrasive and the most vitriolic of the lot. Most of those guys don't actually care about what you guys do unless they feel it directly misrepresents them in some way or hurts their reputation. I'm like, actually *mean* most of the time.

&gt;Absent that specific, explicit intent to cause harm, there's no issue.

I would posit that one does not have to *intend* to cause harm to actually cause it. And I'm not just saying that from the ""heathen is orthopraxic and what you do is more important than what you intend or what you believe"" standpoint, I'm saying that from the perspective of someone who has accidentally run over a dog, accidentally upset someone who lost a parent by mentioning mine, accidentally given someone a bloody nose with my elbow while stretching. It is objectively true that malicious intent is not required to do harm. I mean, shit. Thorin and Aleglad and I certainly aren't malicious in our posting here and it seems to have caused *all kinds* of grief. Does that make the position a little more relatable?

&gt;Someone called him a racist, and he agreed. That's my sum total knowledge of him and that ends my interest in discussion with him.

I think you need to read his post again, unless you're talking about someone different. I only saw a guy admitting to being folkish, and outright denying that it was tied to racism. [This is the guy you meant, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Wicca/comments/2qv3y2/ask_a_heathen/cnaedjq)

&gt;It's irony again - because the stances I've outlined above should make this my statement and your rejection, right? 

We can disagree without dragging that baggage into every interaction. I disagree with /u/HereticHierophant on *so many things.* I still consider her a close friend of mine.

I mean, if you believed we're capable of an uneasy truce with goddamn nazis (and we aren't, but your impression was such that we could manage that level of passiveness), don't you think we can manage the same with you guys? I would certainly say that we disagree with you at least *slightly* less than we do with white nationalists. :P

&gt;I just don't think a dialogue, at the moment, would do anything but radically offend both sides. 

I think that blame is being very wrongly laid on our side of the fence in this instance, is all. We've been very civil, very pleasant. Uncharacteristically so. And you guys have met us... Well, kind of like heathens, honestly. Shit, isn't the fact that *that* happened evidence that we could get along with?

&gt;I think you should wait for the end of troubled waters before you start talking about bridge repair

Then stop stirring them up. Because it's you doing it, not me. It's you calling us nazis. It's you calling us bullies when we invite you into our hall in good faith, where you might get a good ribbing, but you're not going to be genuinely disrespected unless you walk in and like, call us nazis or something.

As much as it *deeply* pains me to say so (kidding! Mostly!) there are good things in Wicca. There are good people in Wicca. Likewise, there are good things and good people in heathenry. I probably disagree with a lot of heathens as much as I disagree with you, albeit about different things. But there can be some common cause the moment *both parties* say ""We can't go anywhere if all we do is bring up old grievances.""

It would make a neat app for people's phones. 

People have this idea that the earth each follows the exact same course around the sun but it doesn't. The orbit is affected by gravitational forces other than the sun for instance. Also the sun is a moving target to measure by and so even we can describe relative distance to the sun we would need something like SOHO orbiting the black hole at the center of the galaxy to get a good idea of the sun's own orbital pathway. We'd have to wait a really long time to get a full run of that data.

I'm also very stoked to how all the characters are wanting to not be ""proper,"" they're so meta enough to defy the typical writer's expectations for a conclusion or purpose in an arc.  It's also intentional by the author -Nisio, so it's like meta meta, or something like that.  I'm not sure if there's a term for that or I just have a terrible vocabulary bank.  Anyways, I'm stoked for whatever is going to be next because it seems like the characters are all going to try to be more meta and unpredictable onwards.

The significance of Tadatsuri and Yozuru not being able to touch the ground because of paranoia or a curse was definitely interesting.  I always thought that Yozuru was trying to not touch the ground because she wants to look down upon Koyokoyo but that seems to not be the case.  I'm guessing they'll touch upon this more later since that wasn't the focus of the arc.

So, does anyone know if the zoom in Arararagi's neck with two bite marks like a vampire near the end will mean anything in the future?  I'm starting to think Shinobu bit him right before Koyomi was about to fight but Shinobu didn't expect that Tadasuri (I can't spell/remember his name - the guy who kidnaps little girls) to blow up from Yotsugi.  Unless... Koyomi has turned into a vampire and couldn't go back... too much speculation at this point.

I liked the soundtrack, it definitely accompanied some great moments.  I also was definitely not bored with the dialogue since I found it to be quite engaging.  If I could I would've liked to slow every frame down and ponder on what they were trying talking about but that'll take a while so that'll happen again during my rewatch in the future.

Also, the relation between Yotsugi and an idol made me lol.  I wonder if they were trying to make fun of the idol things or pander to it... Poe's law.

Overall, this was quite enjoyable for me and made my day a little bit better and enjoyable.","1420070657"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;you just said that the cooldown on her ult is reset by 30 seconds

Come on,i said that after getting a kill,your ult cooldown is about 30 seconds shorter than most midlaners' CDs

&gt;~30 s shorter ultimate cooldown than your opponent

For example,syndra's ult CD is 100s at lvl 1,kata's is 90s

90s-15s=75s

100s-25s≈30s

&gt;Why wouldn't I be harassed while autoattacking?

&gt;It goes down by 15 seconds, but it's not like I'm actually going to get to use it to harass unless the enemy laner fucks up hard.

&gt;Why would you be at low health in-lane against a champion who can neither burst you nor harass you?

&gt;I don't really need to save it because it's a waste of time to gank a champion who gets fucked in lane and doesn't scale into lategame. The enemy laner sorts things out and the enemy jungler gets to win another lane.

&gt;If you do that shit just to try to harass someone in a teamfight you get killed.

&gt;

By saying

&gt;I've smurfed a couple times too. It's pretty relaxing. Sometimes I'll go AD Kassadin.

You are actually negating all i said in the

&gt;You just Q for cs all the time and QEW the enemy laner when you feel like it.

&gt;If you get a kill,you come back to lane with ~30 s shorter ultimate cooldown than your opponent and you are actually able
 to use your ult just for harass because fuck you.

&gt;Dives are a piece of cake cause resets,ganks are either easy to escape or just a doublekill cause resets and AOE

part

And thus you are negating the ""farm with Q"" and ""if you kill someone under tower you can get back easily"" part.

Therefore,my ""You farm with autos not being harassed?"" corresponds to you negating that  ""You just Q for cs all the time""

And so on.

Same with the ""Or does your enemy have some kind of long range targeted hard cc?"" corresponding to you negating ""ganks are either easy to escape,or...""

&gt;If you do that shit just to try to harass someone in a teamfight you get killed.

I didn't mean harassing,i mean that if someone is fighting with an other someone,you should propably help him (if it's indeed a teamfight,not someone wanting to 2v4 with you)

&gt;Not if even one person saves one hard CC for her because she actually can't do anything without her ult.

415+130%AP AOE (4 people max)damage and 575+170% AP single target damage say otherwise.(4 ppl count for aoe dmg and 1 counts for single target since Q applies to 5 targets to be perfectly clear).

&gt;Except she doesn't. Her lane phase is garbage

You and your opponent are likely to end laning phase with 0/0 if you dont do stupid things and dont roam anywhere.

If you roam bot,you are likely to end up 2/0 or something like that.

If you farm well,you end up as a pretty decent assassin,if you get some kills,you end up as a **very** decent assassin

Saying ""i've got no kill potential=my laning phase is garbage"" is like saying ""nasus doesn't have kill potential in late vs jax,his laning is garbage""

Since you are the only aoe reset assassin in the game,with each creep you gain more than the other champions as you are not limited to bursting one champion/harassing champions

&gt;it's a waste of time to gank a champion who gets fucked in lane

If you manage to Kill ~~Bill~~ Katarina once or twice,she ends up useless since she brings only damage to any teamcomp

&gt;The fact you're calling post-rework Kassadin's pre-6 bad says a lot.

If he'd have a good pre-6,his post-6 would be monstrously strong.

Imagine a good already champion getting a 7s cd long range 100 dmg flash.

Not rare when anything anybody ever says about design could very well be right. Meaning the client is the designer. You are not. 

In the universe you're designing for yourself, there are no bad design decisions, merely differing opinions. Meaning yours counts for nothing. Who is going to argue different? 

The user? No. The user is a fiction. Like a unicorn or leprechaun. No help there. Testing? Who ... with *the user we just made up?* You just *say* the word *user.* You don't research them, consult with them, use them as leverage to give your decisions the weight of expertise. 

[Jason Santa Maria might](http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/saying-no). But where are you going to find one of them? 

In the universe you designed, users are like ... a ventriloquist dummy. It sits on anyone's lap. Says whatever stupid thing anyone wants. Scope creep? Cool. Loss of focus? User is all for it. Lard on the gimmicks, and the user is alright with it? *...'salright.*  Because that's how you get the website out *fast.* See how fast yours is going?

 [**Winged scapula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged%20scapula): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __winged scapula__ (__scapula alata__) is a condition in which the shoulder blade, or shoulder bone, protrudes from a person’s back in an abnormal position. It is a rare condition with the potential to lead to limited functional activity in the upper extremity to which it is adjacent. It can affect a person’s ability to lift, pull, and push weighty objects. In some serious cases, the ability to perform [activities of daily living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_of_daily_living) such as changing one’s clothes and washing one’s hair may be hindered. The name of this condition comes from its appearance, a wing-like resemblance, due to the [medial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomical_terms#Anatomical_directions) border of the [scapula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_blade) sticking straight out from the back. Scapular winging has been observed to disrupt [scapulohumeral rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapulohumeral_muscles), contributing to decreased [flexion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion) and [abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abduction_(kinesiology\)) of the upper extremity, as well as a loss in power and the source of considerable pain.  A winged scapula is considered normal posture in young children, but not older children and adults.

I always start off with 2 sets of 5 with the empty bar for squats and then increase by 20 to 50 pounds for a set till I get to my working weight.  I generally only do a set of 3 and then a set of 2 the last 2 sets before my work sets. 

For example today was 225 lbs so my warmup was:
2 x 5 @ 45 lbs (empty bar) 
1 x 5 @ 95 lbs
1 x 5 @ 135 lbs
1 x 3 @ 185 lbs
1 x 2 @ 205 lbs

Then I do my work sets. You want to make sure you don't tire yourself out before you get to the actual sets.

"EQNext","t5_2saln","Oooooo these are some cool ideas. Love the channeling wizard shield and bomb. 
I would love some ancient era bio-bombs that kill all life in the region instantly. IT would be uber rare but seeing how the AI would try and fill back in the now empty space would be awesome to see the aftermath of such an event. Any player in the area would just get a blinding screen much like if you were caught in a nuke and then die wondering what the heck happened and then find out everyone experienced it, then days later general chat is abuzz and a guy said he activated a switch in a dungeon below the area that he thinks did it, imagine on one server a player used it under a major city and the whole place had to be repopulated and the world took like months to recover. Maybe the ballsy AI would go in first while the others who don't trust what happened tumble in later. I hope since the lore is so open and story so general that this stuff happens monthly ALONG with the main rally call content.

As for items that require channeling I would love some spells/items with spells to be specifically REALLY hard to get but are uber powerful but act much like the shield where it immobilizes them. This way special mages would get the spell and use them during peak rally calls. Imagine mass shields around cities and hostile AI can't enter. Would be epic. Maybe they have like HUGE cooldowns so they aren't just constantly using them or burn after using once.

Dave and the team said they wanted to create a community and communities need those pull characters, the ""Leeroy Jenkins"" and other badass characters that you see in the city and go OMG THATS THEM!, Having these special items would help that a LOT. As long as they are extremely hard to get and rare these celebrity adventures would be ""household"" names instead of what happened to other MMO's where the only recognizable names are of the trolls that spam city chats for a month straight then get replaced by the next one. 

The biggest problem though is that with enough time these items could become common enough to where they are constantly upheaving the world environment and making the game feel wild and sporadic to the point it's just no fun. The world has to feel like a normal fantasy realm with a normal day to day that not much happens and then tops once a week something crazy happens somewhere. ","1420070666"

The F-35 does not need a gun that much. It is a bomb truck, not a flying cannon. Strafing is a dangerous job in itself best left to other platforms. It also does not need one for air engagements. Air to air kills have not involved bullets for a very long time (and no, A-10 kills on choppers in desert storm do not count). BVR combat aside, the F-35 (along with any plane in service) would not get close to enemy fighters. If they did, and that would require a serious fuck up, the F-35 is capable of firing at anything within a 360 sphere around it, in addition to seamlessly sharing the position of any nearby enemies, all while maintaining a low level of detection.

"manga","t5_2ql0i","A couple I haven't seen mentioned in here yet from looking at my completed list... All of these are completed manga. Also I've avoided sports manga and only included fighting type action manga. If you're also interested in sports manga I can make some recommendations for that as well.

666 Satan - Mostly pretty mediocre but is written by Kishimoto Seishi, who is the brother of Kishimoto Masashi (Naruto). Overall probably a 6-7/10 but has some good moments. (Note this has only 78 chapters but was published in a monthly format so it's equivalent to 200+ weekly)

Cage of Eden - Has many scifi/mystery elements like Psyren. Less action more suspense but overall solid minus the ending most people don't like. 185 chapters

Change Guy - Martial Arts / School manga. Has good moments but also some overall slowness. 338 chapters

Chrono Crusade (initial printing was Chrno Crusade) - Fantasy/Historical action manga with romantic elements. A bit shorter but still a solid read especially if you enjoy the historical aspects. 57 chapters


Full Metal Panic! - Mecha / military type with many comedy elements and a touch of comedic romance. Again not quite 100 chapters but most are of month-long length (40~ pages). 91 chapters but ~250 for weekly equivalence. 

The Lucifer and Biscuit Hammer - One of the funniest manga I've ever read. True ""anti-hero"", very unique story. Also called Hoshi no Samidare. 65 actual chapters but of month length (~120 weekly)

Nijiiro Togarashi  - By the legend, Mitsuru Adachi. Mostly well known for his sports manga, this is a manga set in historical japan. Mostly comedic, the art style may take some getting useful as the chracters look the same in all Adachi manga. However I think he's one of the best storytellers

&gt; Street Cred is applied as a positive Limit Modifier to all Social Tests in situations where the character’s reputation would be known.

Since Street Cred is the positive side of Running, and Notoriety is the negative side of Running... I'd say that Notoriety points should be applied as negative Social Limit penalties.

Having a high Street Cred, you get bonuses to interacting with Fixers, Johnsons, and Contacts. Having a high Notoriety, you get penalties to those same kinds of people. Potentially, your Notoriety penalty could completely negate your usual Social Limit, meaning no matter how hard you try or how sweet you talk, they don't want anything to do with you.","1420070678"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","It was the dead of winter when the beast arrived. Nobody knew where the beast came from, what it wanted, nor even what it looked like. Nobody had seen it, but we all knew it was there. We saw its tracks, huge six-fingered paw prints, left in the snow. We heard its roars, deep and unearthly bellows, echoing over the frozen lakes. The sled dogs were much too terrified of the beast to want to go out there. The snowmobiles didn't have the fuel to go track the beast.

And no one was going to come in to help us. Our town was too remote. Everyone was afraid.

Night after night the beast came through our town. It roared, it snarled, it bellowed, but no one was brave enough to look at it. Everyone had their doors locked, their lights out, their shades drawn. To the beast, we were as good as dead.

Which would soon be true. Food was running short. We couldn't hold out much longer.

One day we faced the inevitable. We were down to our last cans. The stores had long since been picked clean. If I didn't go out and find something, anything, to eat, we were going to starve. I suited up for the cold, armed myself with my father's hunting rifle, and went outside.

A mile or so outside of town I found deer tracks. The beast's prints were nowhere to be seen. I followed the tracks into the forest.

Hour after hour I trudged through the snow, but still the deer was nowhere to be seen. No matter how far I went, the deer had gone still further. Sunset was fast approaching. I would have to go back empty handed.

As I turned around to head back, the air became very still. I stopped and waited. Nothing happened. It was quiet. Too quiet.

And then the wind picked up. It grew stronger and stronger, whipping up the snow around me. Very soon I could see nothing but snow, and the wind was deafeningly loud. It was rapidly getting dark. I hurried back as fast as I could, but I was hopelessly lost. My tracks became obscured in the blizzard. I fell to my knees.

Without warning the wind let up and once again everything was quiet. Night had fallen. And I heard breathing. Heavy breathing. I looked up.

The beast stood in front of me. It was titanic. It had black fur and hideously red eyes. Its canines were visible and menacingly sharp. It was hunched up and staring at me, ready to pounce.

I scrambled to my feet and aimed at the beast. Neither of us moved. We stared at each other, waiting for the other to make the first move.

I realized that shooting it would have done me no good. It would only make it angrier than it already was. So I decided to try the unthinkable.

I tossed the rifle to the side and walked towards the beast.

The beast did not move at first. Then it relaxed and took a few cautious steps toward me. We drew closer to each other.

When we met, we stopped. Neither of us moved. We simply took each other in. Then, very slowly, and very carefully, I reached my hand towards the beast.

I laid it gently on the side of its head. The beast was still at first. Then it let the weight of its head into my hand and closed its eyes. We remained like this.

Suddenly the beast opened its eyes and picked its head back up. It turned off to the side and put its face close to the snow. It gave a low, sonorous growl, and the snow cleared off before it. In the spot it had cleared a shagawa bush sprouted and grew to full size. Its berries glistened purple among the snow, shining in the starlight. The beast looked up, and an aurora came dancing into the sky. It spat and sparked tongues of gold, red, and green, illuminating the night. The beast looked back towards me.

I smiled, and stretched my hand to the beast once more. It accepted my hand, and together we turned and headed home.","1420070684"

"holofractal","t5_33j70","Basically, every single thing needs an Intelligence to be observing it at all times in order to keep it in a definite form and to direct it/keep it from dissolving back into quantum foam.

After an Intelligence has been active for a while (I originally wrote ""around for a while"" but this is inaccurate, all Intelligences are eternal, but some just kind of sit around doing nothing while others explore their surroundings,) it gains the ability to influence more and more matter and energy, thus ascending towards greater and greater degrees of Godhood. But the more you have influence over, the harder it is to observe every single individual particle.

So as you ascend in degrees of Godhood, you recruit other Intelligences that are just becoming active to sort of subcontract these particles for you. As you evolve into a more and more complex entity, you recruit more and more Intelligences and organize into more and more elaborate structures and substructures.

There is a spiritual evolution, each phase of which is coupled with a phase of physical evolution. You organize a more complex spiritual (spirit = plasma/electricity or something very similar) form, then incarnate into a solid form that matches it. After accruing experience in that solid form, you return to a purely spiritual form and take what you've learned (learning is much easier in a material form) and evolve your spiritual body (with or without help, see below,) then re-incarnate, taking on a physical structure that mirrors your new spiritual form.

In addition to reincarnation, there is resurrection.

Resurrected beings have the immortality of spirit and the solidity of physical matter. The best of both worlds, without the limitations. Once you reach this point, you are ready to take the next step, which is to assist other Intelligences in obtaining or evolving spirit bodies.

Resurrected beings can reproduce, and in doing so will create spirit bodies patterned after their own. They can re-organize spirits from lower forms too, for example a dog to a chimp. It's possible, though much more difficult, for an Intelligence to form or evolve its own spirit body (JHVH did this, hence why He is called self-created.) Once an Intelligence obtains a spirit body in this way, it can grow and learn by leaps and bounds compared to its previous state.

After creating spirit bodies, a resurrected being can fall back into mortality and begin creating physical bodies for those spirits to inhabit. This is what Adam and Eve did. They voluntarily gave up their resurrected state, after populating the Earth with spirits, in order to provide those spirits with mortal bodies so that they (we) could experience the next step.

As Adam and Eve fell, so too did the Earth, from its former place of glory at the center of the Galaxy to its present position at the tip of the Orion spiral arm. Adam and Eve left the congregation of the Elohim (Hebrew word meaning the Gods, plural, not God, singular) to rejoin mortality for our benefit. Later, JHVH did the same, but whereas Adam and Eve fell to bring death on themselves, JHVH incarnated as the man Yeshua Ben Yusuf of Nazareth to bring eternal life on Adam and Eve and all their progeny.

The Egyptian religion depicts the spirits of sinners (those whose hearts are heavier than the feather of Maat) being fed to Ammit, the crocodile/lion/hippo goddess of chaos. Basically those whose choices have taken them to a moral dead-end are dissolved back into quantum foam to be recycled; this happens after they are given EVERY chance to take a better path.","1420070686"

And psychologically, I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty.  Like, I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest, even if she's more covered than many of her less well endowed sisters.  I feel like I get this from other women too - a lot of people assume I put a lot of work into my ""figure"", maybe I'm wearing lots of padding or have implants, or that I'm on a diet and focused on my weight all the time.

So, one of the best things about the typical Pokemon world is that it's relatively modern. There're lamps and cell phones and all kinds of things that you don't get in a D&amp;D game.

I recently ran a fight where the players were stuck in a traffic jam on the freeway into town. Some very large Dragon Warrior-style golems (not the Pokemon ""Golem"") were blocking traffic. The players got out of their commuter bus, walk between the cars, and tell the truck driver at the front of the line to record them on his cell phone. They then proceed to start fighting the golems.

The golems had been there for a few hours, so they'd had time to bunker down. They had come up through the road, so there were large pits in the way; they also had Stealth Rock deployed to make sure any cars that moved would get a rock through the windshield. They also had magical orbs, one per golem, that did more support functions (they drain health, and then give it back to the golem). And they're defensive powerhouses anyway, of course - so they're in this fight for the long haul.

My players beat them to a pulp, of course, with one particularly buff player tanking a golem and its energy orb for about half the fight. It was a seriously hard fight.

...

That's just something recent. A lot of my more unique fights are the ones that aren't just straight-up Pokemon battles, but they're unique because of flavor or the situation.","1420070692"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Actually the equations you mention DO allow for particles that travel faster than light - they just have never been observed in nature, and would have some really weird properties if they do exist (such as needing infinite energy to *slow down* to the speed of light).  I'm not aware of any theories that would let us use these particles to travel faster than light ourselves, so it doesn't really apply to the *original* example, but technically going faster than the speed of light is *not* impossible in this Universe - you just have to be a tachyon.

What's impossible is accelerating to or beyond the speed of light (like I said, the theoretical particles in question already exist at speeds faster than light, and applying energy to them makes them go *slower* - so they also can't 'accelerate' to the speed of light).  It's perfectly permissible to travel *at* the speed of light (if you're a photon), and in theory you can even go faster than it.  But you can't start at a speed lower than light and *increase* your speed to c or above.  A subtle but important difference.","1420070692"

Fewer cars are *required* to use premium.
The storage tanks are the same size.

So, the fuel in greater demand sells faster, the turnover in the tank is faster, price drops are felt sooner.  

Regular price falls fast, premium doesn't.

(in my area the price spread is about .80 right now reg to premium)

That means that anyone who justified buying premium because it 'is better' (and not required for their car) decides that at almost a buck difference, they'll put in regular.

Reg tank goes empty, then next cheapest, then all you have left is $$ premium.

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","Well, I said I would give a detailed analysis of my decision-making process so here it is (Part 1 of 3):

I began this project for two reasons 

- 1) I’m thinking of writing some Dragon Age fiction, so I wanted to get a good handle on the political situation and population centers of Thedas.  [For this reasons, I’ll likely also be making a series of political maps detailing Fereldan and Orlais].  

- 2) There weren’t any good maps online that showed political borders, so I wanted to introduce my head-canon to the general populace.  

As I mentioned earlier, I used the vector drawing software Inkscape to make the map.  It took around a month, (likely only a couple days of actual labor, but I’m writing a thesis).

*

Anderfels:

[Design]  The Anderfels are noted as being blight-ridden and much of the landscape consists of deserted steppes.  As such, I treated the area like I would a desert, limiting most populations to areas around rivers and the coastline.  The country covers a large area, but likely has one of the smallest populations in Thedas.  As such, despite the country being said to extend to the Donarks, there doesn’t seem to be the population available to extend the control that far north.

There are two ethnic groups in the Anderfels, the Anders and the Orth.  The Anders can be found in the valleys created by the Lattenfluss river and around lakes.  Another group can be found around Weisshaupt, which tends to act more as the capital of the region then the seat of the king in Hossberg.

The Orth are a nomadic society, living in the Wandering Hills in the North.  Unlike the Anders, their light settlement can be more considered ‘places where the Orth are likely to be’ rather than places that are continuously settled.  This can be also seen with the various Dalish clans.

[Head-canon Lore]  The Anders are noted as having their own separate language which named the Darkspawn (Hurlocks, Genlock, etc).  I imagine them as being one of the first populations conquered by Tevinter, but largely left alone due to having little of value in their land (perhaps they were raiders or something of the like?).  They maintained their own language and have largely resisted foreign encroachment on their lands.

*

Seheron:

[Design]  Seheron is densely forested, having a large jungle dominating the center of the island.  Despite this, it is one of the oldest Tevinter settlements and likely densely populated despite the large-scale warfare that’s taken place there.  As such, the only place completely barren of light settlement is the mountain range that runs alone the center and the densest jungle.

There are four groups fighting over Seheron: the Qunari, the Tal-Vashoth, the Tevinters, and the Fog Warriors.  The Qunari dominate the eastern portion of the island, but face opposition everywhere else despite their nominal control.  They have large settled populations near Alam and near the large Tal-Vashoth contingent in the North, but their main strength is the city of Seheron and the outlying islands.

The Tevinters are largely hated on Seheron due to the destructive nature of their war effort against the Qunari, but I gave them a still somewhat loyal population in the very south of the island, mostly seen in the city of Alam.  This is simply because I doubt that all of the island would completely abandon the empire, but this group is small and growing smaller the longer the Imperium does not control the island.

The Fog Warrior and the Tal-Vashoth are shown as one group, though broad areas of control are labeled.  As far as naming - the Nahari are named after the ‘Cure of Nahar’, which brought the long lasting fog to the island.  The warrior guerilla tactics that the Fog Warrior practice likely relies on the fog, but the name also extends to the native population of the island that does not fight.
The Tal-Vashoth occupy the northern peninsula of Seheron.  I am not sure if they seek to create a new non-Qun state, or if they simply wish to be left alone, or if they are the beasts the Qun claim them to be.  In any case, they have a large presence in the jungles of the island.

[Head-canon Lore]  Seheron and Alam are quite large cities, despite the destruction that encompassed much of the countryside.  They used to be about equal in size, but as both likely relied on the importation of food, Seheron has grown much larger while Alam has grown weaker.

*

Par Vollen:

[Design]  Not much to say, really, as we know little about Qunari homeland.  The Qunari control the entire island, though the heavily forested interior is left alone.  Qunandar is extremely large and is the only large-scale settlement on the island, though much of the coastline is also likely heavily populated.

The Fex are a pre-Qunari people who occupy parts of the eastern peninsula of the island.  They are extremely few in number from what I can tell of the lore, and likely are controlled politically by the Qunari.

[Head-canon Lore]  The native language of the Fex has likely long been suppressed in favor of Qunlat.

*

Tevinter Imperium:

[Design]  Due to Tevinter being the longest existing human country in Thedas, I knew at the start that they would have a large amount of heavily populated areas.  While likely smaller in population than Orlais, the Tevinter Imperium is quite strong and its reach extends into regions that have likely would have little-to-no settlement like the (desert?) Silent Plains and the Hundred Pillars.  They also control the Arlathan forest, preying upon the Dalish there who still consider it their home.

The population is concentrated on the coast, with the vast majority of it located on the peninsula that Minrathous rests on.  Like on Seheron, the High Reaches mountain chain has little settlement and can be clearly seen on the map.

A number of the surrounding islands also have large scale Tevinter settlement and likely form bases of operation for actions against Qunari-controlled Seheron.
[Head-canon Lore] Due to the long-history of Tevinter settlements, I give a number of sub-types to their culture named after powerful cities and geographical areas.  These identities do not compare in stature to loyalty to Minrathous, but a sort of provincialism does exist.

"MorbidReality","t5_2tz1e","Love the quote you decided to open with. Incredible display of stubbornness. Just incredible.

You glossed over a big point of my relatively short post: intersex people. What do you do if someone is XY and has a vagina, or XX and has a penis (this does occur, by the way)? That conflicts with your view because you've decided that male=XY+penis and female=XX+vagina. There's no room to put them. That's the problem with the chromosomal and genital definitions. It's just not that simple.

If you believe that being trans is a delusion I would invite you to review the definition of what qualifies as a delusion.

If the matter were simply of her being homosexual, why would she not have simply identified as a homosexual male? There's no small number of homosexual men in the US, and they live perfectly happy lives thanks to growing support for homosexual rights. If it were a matter only of her being attracted to men - which is not something that has been established about her, to my knowledge - there would be no reason for her to come out as trans.

&gt;Nope, only women are in touch with their emotions, if you feel feelings as a man, it means you must be a woman! I'm sorry but I just genuinely do not believe that for a second.

I'm not sure what you mean here. Do you mean that the first sentence is how you believe Leelah felt? If so, I imagine there was quite a bit more thought on her part about being trans than that.

I'm going to hope you have conventional (i.e., pro-equality) views on homosexuality for the rest of this post. I will contrast homosexuality and transexuality in hopes that I can extricate one from the other in your worldview.

Homosexuality and transexuality are similar, though not so similar as to be the same thing, as you believe. You are likely also a subscriber to the idea that almost all differences between men and women are a product of societal norms. While there is an extent to which that's true, there are differences that are not caused, or are at least not entirely caused, by societal norms. Patterns in brain activity, for example, are markedly different for men and women.

Here's the kicker: trans men (i.e., men born into bodies you would describe as female) display the patterns of brain activity associated with men, just as trans women display the patterns associated with women. Thus it is not really a simplification to say that a trans person is a person whose brain and body do not match in gender.

Further, transexuals can be sexually attracted to any sex. That is to say, they can be homosexual or heterosexual (relative to either the sex they were designated as at birth or the sex they identify as, it doesn't really matter). The sexuality of a trans person is entirely different from their gender identity.","1420070697"

I would restate point 2 as follows:

2) Brand and Murph have a conversation where we find out that their work on the equation involves them running hundreds of different scenarios (I don't know the details) and Brand says they just need to have it work once.

This is the major point. It fits Murphy's Law perfectly with relation to a multiverse. If it's possible that they can stumble upon the answer, then in some universe they did stumble upon the answer. If it can happen, it will happen.

Please think about Murphy's Law as stated in the movie. Anything that can happen, will happen. What could that mean other than a multiverse? What does it have to do with the movie if you don't believe my theory?

"footballmanagergames","t5_2s0w5","I resigned as the manager of Dartford in FM14 after about 5 years. During that time I got them promoted to the Championship (from the Skrill Premier). I resigned right after I got them promoted from League One.

Why? I had gotten sick of the financial restrictions of the club. I was never given a decent transfer budget during my entire time there so all my transfers were freebies and I didn't have nearly enough wage budget to resign the players I wanted or bring in players who were good enough for the Championship. Plus we were already in massive debt and the board had decided to expand the stadium yet again (although I think this was because of the rules of the league). 

I ended up quitting that save soon after like I usually end up doing when I leave a club in FM... I much prefer sticking to one club and building my own team, if I want to play as another team I usually just start a new save. Anyone else a one club man?","1420070701"

I want to be clear that I'm saying it's an ugly UI, not a bad one. Usability and aesthetics often go hand-in-hand, but a UI can quite easily be ugly while also being powerful and easy-to-use. Maybe that's TouchWiz, I don't know. I've honestly never gotten past the looks, but looks are very important to me.","1420070702"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Anything to do with fighting, fist or fire. 

A gun doesn't have a up and down recoil (anything with a stock) but rather a back and forth recoil. 

GUNS HAVE AMMO!!! everyone has a limited amount of ammo.

You can't out run gun fire. Like when you see the hero running and then you see a bunch of bullet hits behind him... Uh uh. It would simply take a small adjustment of the weapon in question to get your hits on target.

If the explosion is in any way felt by the person in question (considering it's some sort of frag) you'd be full of shrapnel or torn apart.

Real explosions are almost never fiery, unless gasoline or something was hit.

Tanks don't really get obliterated, but rather get pierced.

A gun shot wound makes it very hard to move and bleeds a good deal, but aren't 100% lethal. Look at the stats for ERs with GSWs (Gun shot wounds) that survive, or at least come in alive. They had to get shot, wait at least like a minute or more, and then get driven to the hospital. Now if you pop into a room with your service revolver and pop the three guys that are guarding the door in the torso, chances are they're not going to be dead right away, especially if they're wearing kevlar. They could hypothetically still try and draw a weapon or call for back up or scream.

Getting shot in a bullet proof vest does not mean you can get up and walk and continue fighting. You'd be down for the count at that point.

Getting punched in the face makes less sound than the sound of your clothes and shoes shuffling during the fight.

Getting punched in the face is not an instant knock out and more than often is simply the beginning of the fight. I've been punched in the face many times and have never once stumbled greatly, even if it was sudden. It's surprisingly hard to knock someone down with a punch to the face.

Getting kicked/punched in the legs and sides REALLY fucking hurts. You will often stumble or crumple down a little when you get hit there.

Getting a broken leg is pretty much impossible to walk **ON**.

Getting stabbed or cut hurts, but you can almost always keep fighting after getting one of these wounds.

Fist fights hurt your hands if they're not protected. You almost never see that part.

Martial arts are almost never effective.

PLEASE please please movie people, get your action scenes right, and for the love of god, show your actors how to use a gun. Hell take them to a shooting range and get them to play air soft of paintball or something. Just please, do something.

Betrayal may be bad, but it isn't meant to be a troll move - it's a gameplay mechanic. I don't endorse it being fixed, but if the community wants it I can't really say no.

NHL 15 finally got NBCSN graphics in place,  but the game is a beta-release mess, so if they go and change the score ticker NOW, then NHL 16 will be outdated, and it won't get fixed until the PS5, and without a completely accurate NHL video game experience I'll be bored for the next 10 years, and I'll probably get into politics and because I'm really manipulative I'll be good at it, then I'll become a senator and probably declare on Eastern Europe for shady reasons, and the Russians will have to declare war back on us, and everything becomes a shitty mess like in those Mad Max movies, and then humanity is lost forever.

"coins","t5_2qhuq","2014 was really the first year I seriously collected(and even then, only collected for half of it). That said, I picked up a lot of really cool pieces. My most recent has already become the favorite of my collection because I have wanted one ever since I bought my first ancient, so it was a great Christmas present to myself. This was just ordered yesterday on Vcoins actually, an Alexander the Great tetradrachm. Pictures [here](http://i.imgur.com/Ypsm9wY.jpg). Full ID: 

Alexander III AR Tetradrachm. Pella mint. Circa 325-315 BC. Head of Herakles right, wearing lion skin / Zeus enthroned left, holding eagle and sceptre; SI in left field. Mueller 1397. Price 236.

The first time I bought an ancient was at a small coin shop in Estes Park, CO. The owner was super nice, and even though I was new and only had the money to buy a few cheap late Roman/Byzantine bronzes he showed me a beautiful, nearly mint state Alexander tetradrachm and I knew I would have to buy one some day and yesterday was that day, can't wait to receive it.

Runner up is my 8 Reales piece from the Cazador shipwreck. I previously posted some pictures [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/2dldfm/been_watching_el_cazador_coins_for_a_while/). I spent a lot of time hunting down this one, as I wanted one in pretty high condition and as readable as possible and it was my first $50+ coin purchase so it was  a big step in collecting for me.","1420070706"

"army","t5_2qtr8","What does everyone mean here by ""war for profit""?  Is there a specific definition?  What I hear when I hear ""war for profit"" is a concrete assertion of a conspiracy to wage a war because there will be a fallout of cash for vested interests - primarily military contractors, and politicians.

When I was more argumentative and I would get into this, that seemed to be the image that leftists (and certain libertarians) intended to project, while they could fall back on what was technically the truth - the United States tends to get into wars in areas where we have legitimate economic interests AND something shady is going down (for instance, why we might intercede on behalf of Kuwait or in HOA, but not really GAF about central Africa).

""War for profit"" seems to be a very imprecise and ideologically motivated way to describe the latter scenario, which I take to be the one that actually exists.

With the first scenario people tend to lash out at specific people and companies.  The second, if it is problematic, is an issue of globalization and capitalism for which no individuals or specific organizations are liable.","1420070710"

&gt; …*only* finished High school … had a *steady* job … lack of *drive* to do anything … There's just nothing for me to do ... but *wait*… I just can't really *change* … *small* room

You see what's going on there? To me at least it seems that all those words are about your expectations. They look like metaphors for progress and motion. 

I mean I'm not a doctor or anything so don't mistake this for any kind professional advice - and more importantly I'm not you so I don't know if what I'm saying is true but … all those phrases seem to be suggesting that you have an expectation that there is only one direction that your life should be going in - but who says so? 

It's not me saying it, and if it's not you either … then these sound like they must be the expectations that you just *think* other people have for you. 

Does that make sense at all?

I'm trying to say that maybe it's true you can't change yourself but you can change your expectations about what you think should be happening.

Well, maybe just something to think about.

On to plants!! You have many many options, and I for one loooove working with waterplants, for me it's just way more easy than real life plants, (can't drown them, harr harr) if you can get it, try an anubias plant, just make sure you tie it to your root and don't put it in the sand, after some weeks it will stick to the root by it self. 

You can certainly try many different plants, I don't like fast growing plants, because when you get good lighting in your tank it becomes a daily struggle to keep tidy, time is my friend! 

You can try making a diy Moss wall, very cool. Or tie moss to your root instead of anubias. And you can grow grass, there are some beautiful water grass that would look nice in the background. 

There are hundreds of forums dedicated to water plants, and a hundred different ways to succeed. Basically you need lights, plants and some fertiliser if you want to get fancy. ","1420070711"

Then there is the diet that they are fed. Cows don't eat corn, they eat grass. Companies trying to advertise that as a good thing, is really doing a slight of the hand for feeding the cows cheap and unhealthy feed.

Even if the cows are pasture fed, or hay off the truck, this is usually grown with hazardous pesticides and herbicides. So is the corn.

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","""How could you get the facts wrong on something so simple?""

The answer is that I meant to insert the alibi part in here. 

To your other points, how can we be in the business of determining the magnitude of lies? You are making it seem like Adnan lying to detectives the day he was interrogated as to his interaction with Hae on the day of her death is a small lie. This is not a small lie. This is a huge lie. 

I wrote my point as an exercise to remove parts of the case that are subject to key players lying. 

And again, we can always posit alternatives to any one piece of circumstantial evidence. But in this case, there are several things that point to Adnan. 

If you don't think that Adnon did it , it is hard to argue that anyone else did it other than Jay. And this doesn't make much sense. 

But this is really the part that is preventing your argument from being compelling;

""Jay's inconsistencies about things he was involved in are like the eyewitness to a crime who keeps creating a different suspect.""

but the cause is good.

there is no accountability for police, and everyone knows it. 

if there was, we would see a few more behind bars

there are incidents of abuse constantly

this has nothing to do about disliking police at all, i dont understand the people who think this is all against police?

remember the guy in new jersey who was lucky enough to have a dash cam?

the police officer on camera was saying ""stop tying to grab my gun"" while... the citizen wasnt even near him, standing perfectly still.

what would have happened if there was no dashcam?

and that is just 1 example in 1 city

why is it that police accused of rape by 10+ different women? dont get convicted?

if a women says you raped her and calls the cops, you will be taken away that moment

but a cop cannot get convicted with 10+ witnesses?

this is america for you.

this is what the protests are about

that you have no rights when it comes to police

Courts will interpret these clauses narrowly and the exemption clause has to be within the four corners of (i.e. related to) the contract. The state and federal governments also have a range of legislation aimed at eliminating unfair terms from contracts.

Chapter 67: Jaime

What Happens:

Jaime has moved into the apartments of the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but his sword and uniform feel ill-fitting upon him. He has been ignored by everyone in his family during Tyrion’s trial, including Cersei. He wonders if the Kingslayer is fit to occupy the title that so many great men have held before him; he is amused to discover that Ser Barristan had taken the time to record his own ousting from the Guard before leaving in the Kingsguard history book. He notes how paltry his own record seems in comparison to Ser Barristan’s, and wonders when he stopped being like Ser Arthur Dayne and more like the Smiling Knight, noted for his cruelty as much as his chivalry.","1420070722"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","I think Chris Paul is probably the closest thing the NBA has to an Andrea Pirlo-type playmaker.

Rajon Rondo's inability to shoot the ball and his struggles at the free-throw line take him out of the conversation. Rondo is more of a Fabregas during the early years at Arsenal where he'd get bags of assists but goals seemed to elude him for some reason.

Russell Westbrook is the closest the NBA has to a Balotelli. On his day he's absolutely unstoppable and capable of taking apart teams with ease, like Balotelli against Germany in the Euros. At the same time, Westbrook's shot selection and decision-making can be a little baffling at times and he can play you out of a game. So I wouldn't compare him to a soccer-style playmaker in the same sense. 

I can't think of any more soccer comparisons off the top of my head. Fun game though.","1420070722"

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","I was introduced to KSP by [One F Jef](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5WMwekqnmUAsMDYZLd9nTXbsrbYnThrL), a guy doing ""let's play"" videos.  I learned the very basic by watching him, and caught a few improvements from his videos.  Then I learned about Scott Manley and I realized That Jef is only scraping the surface of proper space flight.  I'm still at Jef level, with a lot to learn for the real pros.

Example: 

* To get into orbit the easy way: shoot straight up until your trajectory goes up to 100km or so in the map view, then cut the engine and wait to reach that altitude.  At the top, accelerate sideways, parallel to the ground, until your trajectory is an orbit.  Inefficient, but easy.

* Minor improvement: do a ""gravity turn"".  Don't go straight up, go at an angle instead.  Same principle: get your trajectory to the desired altitude and cut the engines.  When you reach the peak of the trajectory, accelerate parallel to the ground until you have an orbit.  You can also learn to use manoeuvre nodes.

* More advanced improvement: aim to the east on take-off so that you benefit from the rotation of the planet.  At all times, try to aim close to the prograde indicator as that has the best efficiency.  Don't go too fast while you're still in the atmosphere, as that too is inefficient.  Etc, etc.

There's always something to learn but there are ways to start easy first.

"AcademicBiblical","t5_2w28m","&gt;Paul felt the Gentile mission was his Gospel and it needed to be defended in light of the Gospel of James, which had Jews and Gentiles segregated in the family of Christ. 

Paul was trying to defend his credentials as an apostle by saying he got his info straight from Jesus. He did not like the idea of being subordinate to or less than the Jerusalem pillars and tried to deny that they'd taught him anything.

&gt;Why does Paul never claim arguments concerning the resurrection between him and the disciples? 

Maybe because there weren't any? You're assuming that they claimed anything different than he did. If they were only claiming visions like Paul's, then why would there be an argument?

&gt;What's wrong with Josephus on James? 

He's probably talking about a different James. The Jesus ""called Christ"" probably refers to Jesus ben Damneus, who Josephus says was appointed High Priest in response to the killing of James. All High Priests were called Anointed/Messiah/Christ. It was a title of office. All Jewish kings were Messiahs as well.

Even Josephus doesn't say anything about this James' personal beliefs, though. Even if it is, hypothetically, about the James that Paul talks about, it doesn't say anything about him except that he was killed, It doesn't even say *why* he was killed.

"Survivalist","t5_2qoov","Do you want to work with outdoors / survivalist products and topics? Or do you want to spend your days managing a team of writers, managing a website, managing affiliate relationships, building a social following, performing basic SEO, etc?

I've been making my full time living in internet marketing for over a decade now. Blogs and content sites generally fold in the first 3-6 months because the people who start them miscalculate the amount and type of work that is required to keep a site stocked with fresh content. Start a survivalist blog and you won't be a survivalist, you'll be a full-time webmaster and writer. Is that what you do with your free time when you're fortunate enough to get some? Sit down and write for two hours?

My advice, for whatever it means (or doesn't)... You should do one topic with better content than anyone else is providing. And for a gear-focused market, this means youtube videos and product reviews. And those companies aren't going to mail you freebies for reviewing until you've got a following. And those visitors aren't going to seek you out or read your blog or click your ads or buy your affiliate products just based on how well you write about starting a fire with dryer lint. Write about that for a few months and then check your site stats, you'll be one blog of 10,000 publishing the same thing, and you'll have to split the already-limited pool of potential visitors with them. And they've got a head start.

Pick a category of product that you consider yourself to be an absolute subject matter expert on. Something you've owned a bunch of, and that you're fairly up-to-date on. Start by buying things at your local Lowes or Cabelas or wherever. Get a cheap telescoping tripod and a decent video camera. Write out the bullets for a review, make it, watch the video, make it again. Rinse and repeat. Then return the shit to the store.

You need original content that will keep people coming back. Stuff they can't read in the Amazon product description or on some forum. Guns are better than tents, because gun people never stop buying or reading about guns. Campers aren't buying 4-5 tents per year. But you'll also have pretty thin pickings for affiliate partners if you're talking guns.

Take a stab at one small-medium thing on your own before you try to recruit. Give it 3 months and decide if more writers are really what's missing.","1420070727"

&gt;__Chris Martin__ of The Chris Martin Band
&gt;__Coldplay__ (aka U2) is a Radiohead cover band also known as ___The Chris Martin Band.___ Taken into the hearts of everyone, Coldplay garnered a reputation of being ""lovely sane lads"" (Sir Paul McCartney). Legend has it that there are three more members of Coldplay apart from just Chris Martin. As of November 2011, these band members have yet to reveal themselves to the public, while speculation has mounted in the past about who, or what, they really are.  Most notably in 2007, The Daily Telegraph ran an investigation into who the drummer was, confirming it was the late __Dennis Hopper.__ Coldplay have since denied this, claiming that Dennis is too much of a nice guy.

The index value of the consonant * 2 + the index value of vowel will net the first number in the pin sequence. Repeat for the second portion and concatenate.

Now I'm stuck as to how the syntax for list comparison works.
Example

    User Input for pincode 1000 is 'daba'
    coded = []
    coded.append(list(pincode))

result = [ 'd', 'a', 'b', 'a' ]

And I'm stuck:

    for value, in CONSONANTS or VOWELS:
        return index

Desired result = [2, 0, 0, 0]

And even after that I'm lost how to manipulate the values.

Highs: Attended 5 festivals (Northwest Arkansas, Omaha, IJA, Kansas City, St. Louis). Finally got solid control of upside-down box. Made a few videos. Got some pattern tutorial animations accepted by the Library of Juggling site. Developed a decent system for organizing my pattern research.

Lows: Missing the EJC and JJF.

Goals: Teach some workshops - yes (IJA and Kansas City festivals). Upside-down box - yes. Seven balls - nope. Perform at least once - yes (Kansas City festival renegade show). 2/3 of IJA/EJC/JJF - nope.

Banes: Weird elbow nerve pain, but fortunately it only lasted a couple weeks. Not having enough time to practice.

Crushes: Emil Dahl's magnetic club routine, Michael Falkov, Dan Barron, Kota Hayashi, Luke Burrage, Jugglology, Jonathan Root's mustache, the Dinner and a Show show.

Surprises: Won a couple prizes (IJA tutorial contest, Bravo Juggling photo contest). When Juggling.tv featured one of my videos. Some amazing new friends.","1420070740"

You could easily patch together a ronia team which will take you relatively far in the game. You also have LMeta which is the new hotness thanks to her buff.

You also have the beginning of a beautiful Athena team in there, just missing Athena herself and possibly Izanagi (but he's not absolutely required, though if you need a booster, king flamie works in a pinch). I see several perfect subs for her - MeiMei, Apollo, and Apocalypse. I'd give my left nut for any of those (for my Athena team). 

I guess if I was just starting out, I'd probably go with LMeta. You already have Angelion (fairlon) and Echinda. Now you just need to get Light Valk and evolve your Shynee.

You won't go wrong with either LMeta or Ronia. Though, pick one and stick with it. Flip flopping back and forth through team building slows you down. Most people have the habit of not fully maxing their teams and it hurts their gameplay.","1420070742"

In theory, a special-interest group serves its own interests and if run like a business, it wouldn't care about the negative impact it has on others, as long as it serves its own self-gain; and that would be an example of a bad union. However, there are many more variables that have to be considered. Unions are founded on the idea of solidarity. It is bad form for a union to undermine other unions. Other ideologies come into play as well. A union of teachers will advocate for higher education. The California State University faculty union took a voluntary pay cut for the benefit of the whole.

It is perfect parallel of the discussion here comparing Costco to WalMart. Costco understands the value of ethical business practices and can make a profit while being socially responsible. Unions are the same and in the same light, there are the WalMarts of unions, police unions for one.","1420070743"

"StonerPhilosophy","t5_2s5se","&gt;**I**'m sick of being attached to ego. **I** want to connect with my eternal self

That's the perception of separation (ego) talking. *""I want to connect with the ocean, said the wave to the whirlpool.""*

You can't connect with it, because you *are* it. The sentence *""I want to connect with ... ""* and the belief that the sentence carries any meaning in relation to what is true is what creates the preception of separation between *I* and *not-I*, between *self* and *other*. The ego as a symbol of self-reference is expressed emotionally as precisely the desire to connect with *it*.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; The more important point (which I didn't make in my last response) was that animals don't do anything out of some abstract principle.

Sure.

&gt; They wouldn't have occasion to assuage their suffering by rationalizing a ""greater good"", like humans do.

I think I agree, but this seems like what I already said in my first reply and it also seems like a counterargument to your main point, so I am confused.

&gt; The sole source f motivation they have is survival. 

Um, possibly. Our own motivations and abilities result from the natural selection process too though. So if an animal is afraid of something and runs away and we call this motivated by survival (even though the animal isn't thinking about abstract concepts like that it may possibly die) then it doesn't seem completely clear that a human's (admitted more complex) process of motivation couldn't be called motivated by survival (or more accurately genetic propagation) either.

Why does someone run 20km when his survival doesn't require it? Well, it's more likely that individuals that are particularly fit or have distinguished themselves will breed and pass on their genetic material which increases the likelihood of such individuals being represented in the population.","1420070745"

The Goodyear Vivas are dirt cheap, decently aggressive, but you get what you pay for when it comes to quality of the rubber. They usually only end up lasting a few years before needing to be replaced. 

Really, my best advice is to just shop around. I personally run a Dextero DHT2 on my '97 Explorer, since I do nothing but highway driving and needed something decently cheap. Go into your local shops and ask them what they have in stock and what they can order in that size. ","1420070755"

But someone else did say something, and I saw him getting piled on. So I joined the fray to remind everyone that what he said was true. This is only a joke to atheists, and only atheists who are at war with religion or religious people rather than atheists who merely don't believe that any gods exist. This is religious propoganda. That its for a religion of no religion makes no difference. Except that this site is overwhelmingly atheist so the number who'll call bullshit is diminished.

iFixit.com has really great ""tear-down"" guides.... go read those and you'll see it's pretty easy to slide it open and upgrade the RAM or HDD.

"civ","t5_2rk3b","Babylon is quite a strong civ, but I really like their colors as well. Rome is pretty cool with their royal purple. America's colors fit quite nicely IMO even if it's not a civ I particularly care for. Mongolia always looks like a plague spreading across the map, which seems fitting. Something about the Aztecs seems very fitting in terms of being cultural killers, and same with the Celts and Indonesia for their religion and war emphasis. Egypt also has a bit of royal gold and purple going on. Korea's colors scream science for some reason to me, have no idea why. Maya's colors reflect their love of religion and peace quite well IMO. Polynesia's colors seem to reflect cultural islanders quite well. Russia's colors always seem to reflect their productive and expansive tendencies. Sweden and Venice's colors also seem to reflect what they emphasize.

Super abstract, I know, but I really feel like all those colors work very well for the civs in question.","1420070758"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","If there's love, it's always worth the effort to try. I think the hardest part of having a successful marriage is learning how to listen. At  least for me, it was. You want to get him talking? Give him something to loosen his mood, like beer, wine, or other legal relaxants, and just start asking questions. Pretend it's a first date, you know, when you're trying to impress him and make him think how cool you are. Try getting to know him again, and let him get to know you. Do this more than once. 

Each time does not have to lead to a state of the relationship talk, in fact, it's better if the first few don't. The goal should be not to resolve problems, but to just have a good conversation. After a little bit, he should come around to being able to work on the issues you guys have. 

Honestly, it sounds like therapy would benefit both of you, but therapy won't work for him if he's dragged into it. I'd suggest you go yourself so you can start to feel better about you. PPD is serious and shouldn't be ignored. That could be a time bomb that can come back and devastate you and your family if not properly treated. Take care of yourself if not for you, then for your child. I find cognitive / behavioral therapy to work better for me than traditional talk therapy, but YMMV.

In any case, good luck. You've got some hard work ahead of you, but trust me, the rewards for succeeding in such an effort should be well worth it. Keep us updated!","1420070761"

"Adoption","t5_2qr1s","Unfortunately, when you placed your child for adoption, you (at least legally) lost that role of being the voice/advocate for your child.  If you feel/felt strongly about continuing to be your child's voice/advocate until they grow older, then it would really be better to keep your parental rights legally by not placing your child for adoption.  If you're going through a rough patch, it's better to get temporary support without permanently relinquishing your rights to your child, which is what adoption is, even open adoption.

I understand if first parents were coerced or forced into giving up their child and that's a crappy situation to be in.  They didn't have a choice and their child was taken away.  But that's not the child's/adoptee's fault.

But if parents WANTED to remain as the parent/voice/advocate for their child during the childhood years, and CHOSE adoption, then they perhaps made a very unfortunate choice.  Also, not the child's/adoptee's fault.

If you were misled into making this unfortunate, permanent choice of wanting to guide your child's voice until later years, but instead had your child adopted, then I'm sorry others misled you.  And I hope that you can help other struggling parents so that they don't get similarly misled into an unfortunate choice they might later regret for the rest of their lives.","1420070762"

I'd known her for about 8 years then; I'd been with him for four and was living with him. Turns out he wanted out of the relationship and thought self-destructing was the way to go. She first said he was taking advantage of her (of her low self-esteem, that is, not like sexual assault), but then she admitted she'd always been jealous of me and how easy I seemed to have it. And actual example she gave was that I got better grades than her in college without having to study as hard. Um... okay.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Genders being divided was the way it was for good chunks of history.

The idea of intense emotional intimacy between man and woman who see each other as equals began with the Romantic Movement (think Beethoven) though some suggest it existed already during The Enlightenment to a degree.

Back in the 1800's the wife was a second class citizen (considered equal to a teenager) and simply existed to cook and clean and care for the children while the man was out farming or ranching.

Generally the marriages were good because they didn't expect much out of them.

95% of the marriages were a success in the 1800's. (divorce only 5%)

It wasn't so bad.","1420070763"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; the standard library is outsourced to a third party company

I've poured the last 8 years of my life into VC's STL, do I count?

As I mentioned at CppCon 2014, licensing Dinkumware's STL in the mid-90s was an excellent decision. In addition to achieving C++98/03 conformance, this made it possible to pick up TR1 and C++11/14 years later.

&gt; The marketing never pointed out the HUGE disclaimer

On VCBlog, I [clearly said](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/09/12/10209291.aspx): ""In VC11, we intend to completely support the C++11 Standard Library, modulo not-yet-implemented compiler features.  (Additionally, VC11 won't completely implement the C99 Standard Library, which has been incorporated by reference into the C++11 Standard Library.  Note that VC10 and VC11 already have &lt;stdint.h&gt;.)""

I do agree that 2012 had a bunch of bugs, for several reasons. The biggest reason was the huge influx of new code (TR1 in 2008 SP1, lots of C++0x in 2010, atomics/multithreading in 2012). Compensating for missing compiler features was another source (e.g. variadic templates). Working Paper churn was also quite problematic (e.g. this led to weirdness in &lt;random&gt;). In 2013, [we fixed](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/06/28/c-11-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013.aspx) many of these bugs (and switched to real variadic templates), and 2015 will contain [even more](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/06/06/c-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-visual-studio-14-ctp1.aspx) fixes. (I'll be writing another VCBlog post explaining the fixes between 2015 CTP1 and RTM.)

Also, since people always ask: 2013 shipped almost all of the C99 Standard Library, and 2015 is completing the missing pieces, modulo extremely minor omissions (I could look them up, but I'm on vacation; IIRC it's a couple of the FP macro things, and tgmath.h which is irrelevant to C++).","1420070766"

Then she starts having her boyfriend over and having sex on EVERYTHING. I wasn't overly bothered until she stopped cleaning up after herself. She stopped cleaning, doing dishes, leaving her dirty laundry everywhere, and then she'd bitch to me about how gross my apartment was. After about 2 months I hit my breaking point. I walked into the bathroom and she had bled on everything. Seriously, menstrual blood on the toilet, on the floor, on the bathmat, all over the bathtub, on the shower curtain. Everywhere. I told her to clean it immediately as she wasn't a pig. She said that it wasn't her job to clean my apartment.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Dear Surviving Human,

I hope to God someone is reading this, that someone else survived. This letter is my experience when the world ends. I hope this letter educated you on what has happened if you don't know the full story yourself.

I had been studying in China for my college language course, I thought it would be fun and I was only going to be studying there for 2 months. My host family consisted of a host mom and dad, and a sister. That particular day I was heading to the New Years celebration, which was a very big holiday in China. 

The celebration was fun, I separated from my host family and looked around on my own. There was a lot of drinking, a lot of dancing, and a lot of people. The celebration was probably the biggest one I had seen in my whole life. As I wandered through the celebrating hordes of people, the music changed to almost militaristic and a countdown began. I was sure it was only about 10 but I had a few drinks and went with it. 

The entire crowd was comparable to a mosh pit as the timer counted down from 60. People were throwing things into the air, pushing each other around, and generally acting barbaric. The behavior increased in craziness as the timer reached 0. As the timer stopped, the behavior changed from excited to rushed. 
A woman over a loud speaker addressed the crowd. ""Everyone, operation Yellowstone has been a success. Initiate lock down procedures."" 

My phone rang as everyone began leaving and running to their homes. I figured it was my host family telling me to go home, but it was my dad. Before I left, my dad and I had got into a fight with some choice words, and I hadn't talked to him since. When I answered I knew something was wrong.

My dad was panicked and was asking me if I was ok. I told him I was and asked him what was happening. I wish I had never asked that question, I wish I had never gotten that call. My dad told me what had happened. For some unknown reason their was a national emergency broadcasting through the United States. They broadcast announced Yellowstone had erupted for an unknown reason and told everyone to stay in there homes. 

As he explained he told me he heard something, my mom screamed and I received a dial tone. I tried calling back but I got no answer.

After the call the streets were no where near as crowded, still, some people running but most of the crowd gone. I saw an abandoned bike and took it to my host families house. Along the way I only saw people praying, homeless people scattered through streets and empty buildings, cars burning, and chaos from those out on the streets. I got to my host house and saw the family through the window, they were packing there things. I threw the bike away and ran inside. 

My host family had bags of things and were running downstairs. I followed without them knowing. I had been in the basement multiple times, but never saw what I saw then. They pulled over a couch to reveal a heavy metal door, my host dad pulled open the door to reveal a ladder. Before they went down I grabbed my host dads arm to stop him. He spoke barely any English, and was obviously not happy to see me. He told me to leave, get away, find somewhere else to hide. I refused to leave without answers. 

He then proceeded to pull a pocket knife from his pants pocket and lunged, his wife and daughter cowering away from us. He cut my arm, a light cut but painful. A pushed him back but he kept coming. I took a small glass vase and waited for him to lung again. As he charged with the knife I sidestepped and smashed the glass over his head. He crumpled to the ground. 

His wife and daughter were crying and cowering. I knew he would attack again when he woke up so I did the logical thing. I went down the ladder in the hatch, locking it shut as I descended. The descent took longer than I expected, and as I was going down all I heard was banging on the hatch door. I finally made it down to solid ground and was greeted by a big cache of food and water, beds, and little light. 

The room was about the size of a large bedroom, and was extremely dark.  I took in my surroundings and found a desk with a desk lamp. I turned it on to see a packet entitled ""The Yellowstone Protocol"". There wasn't much, but the text goes as follows.

""Congratulations, you have survived the eruption of the Yellowstone Super Volcano! The great Chinese empire has destroyed tyrannical America, and in 10 short years we will be the world power once again. All high ranking Chinese leaders are safe, as well as all tax paying, law-abiding citizens. You will have enough food for 3 people, so as long as you followed the one child law you will live happily and safe. In 10 years time a bell will go off to alert you it is finally safe to be above ground. Enjoy yourself, in a short while everything will be just fine.""

I write this to you for a couple reasons. The biggest being sheer boredom, considering I've been sitting down here for 10 years. However I also want to write this so if anyone finds this they can know what happened here. The bell went off weeks ago, yet I'm too afraid to go to the surface. However, by writing this I know that if I die out there, someone, someday, may find this letter.

Yours Truly,
Jeff Heinberger","1420070769"

The cops point of view is they live in a life and death world and dont have the luxury of all this progressive stuff. So they have sacrificed community relations for safety. This is a downward spiral to be sure, but it isn't going to be fixed by cracking down on police becuase they aren't going to change. There just aren't enough progressive people who want to be cops, can be cops, who will work for cop pay.

We separated, I got my schedule and saw we had the same lunch. I found her at lunch, sat with her and talked a little bit but it was a table with her friends so I was shy. Next day, walk to her house, and her mom said she left already. Turns out she walked with other people but I assumed it would be an everyday thing. At lunch, I walked over and said hi but she gave me this cold look at I will never forget.

However, the reason I'm cautious about this is the fact that the Baggies have sacked their manager and every single time I bet on a game where the manager has just been sacked, I get an unexpected result (well, I lose). Remember the QPR vs Palace game? Everyone expected QPR to win, and they drew (out of no where really). Lucky I had a DNB on that one. ","1420070781"

Prey was much different to e.g. Half Life, where the protagonist is silent and thus has very little that a player can sympathise with.

My next would be Fallout 3. Rarely do I get so involved in a game that I end up playing it for more than an hour at a time. Fallout 3 (played on Xbox) was riveting, well scripted and with some excellent attention to the story. I'd followed no hype for the game's release.

Me personally? I don't hit women. I roll with a girl that will beat the brakes off a bitch in a heartbeat for putting hands on me. If for some reason she was the female to be assaulting me I'd just bounce out because that's how I was raised. 

But best believe if you're a man half my size, my size, twice my size, it doesn't matter what size, and you come at me with them hands that I am not playing fuck around games with you. My goal immediately becomes to cause you as much physical pain as humanly possible so your immediate reaction is to stop attacking me and get the fuck away as fast as you can, or to beat you into unconsciousness so you no longer have the option to attack me. Don't want that to happen? Then don't play that shit. 

Because in today's day and age people get killed and that's a fact. So no I'm not gonna wait for the guy half my size to pull out a knife and gut me, because he's pissed and has the ability to do so still because I'm defending myself with half my ability because he's smaller than me.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Title? (I suck at these kind of things): Super Smash Bros Restoration

Mechanic Feel: Melee Speed, both on the ground and in the air. (Wave Dashing, Light/Heavy Shielding, and Edge hogging would return, but instead of L-Canceling returning every character would have their landing lag for all of their aerials cut in half, simply to make the game more accessible. Also, Dash Dancing would be made very useful again, and finally characters would retain their ground momentum when they jump.)

New Gameplay Mechanic: Delta (Battlefield) versions of each stage.

New Game Mode: Story Mode. Each character would have their own story, and it would end with a fight against the final boss.

Removed Game Mode: Target Blast.

New Advanced Tech: Special Canceling. You can cancel your Special attacks by Jumping or Shielding. (On the ground only)

Removed Tech: Perfect Pivoting

Nintendo Newcomers: Isaac (Golden Sun), Starfy (The Legend of Starfy), Zael (The Last Story), Skull Kid (The Legend of Zelda), and Fiora (Xenoblade Chronicles)

3rd Party Newcomers: Lloyd Irving (Tales of Symphonia), and Zero (Mega Man)

2 Characters to be cut: Diddy Kong (I hate him both in Smash and out of Smash) and Dark Pit.

Returning Character: Solid Snake.

New Stage Gimmick: Certain Stages (Likely a Fire Emblem Stage) can be destroyed by certain factors, and you can make the stage itself grow smaller by destroying parts of the main platform itself.

4 new items: Companion orb (Similar to the assist trophy and Pokeball, but should a character pick it up a character specifically from their universe will spawn and help out for a bit.), Duplicate Cherry (Or whatever that item from Mario 3d World that creates a duplicate of the player character is called. Would give an Ice Climber effect), Blue Falcon (Summons F-Zero cars to run down the opponents), and a Chaos Emerald. (Freezes opponents in place for about 3 seconds)

4 cut items: Banana Peels, Beetle, Drill Arm, and Fairy Bottle.


 New Final Boss: Collective Subconscious (This Boss will have a design that reflects all of the fighter's universes)","1420070796"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Newton's physics still exist, but with a new level of nuance and clarity that explain some previously unexplainable things and make some ""impossible"" things possible.

See when you say shit like this, its pretty easy to tell that you have absolutely zero fucking clue on what the fuck you are talking about, and yet you act like Im the one that is being close minded. 

You are acting like we can just manipulate some variables in some way shape or form and come up with a way to travel faster than light. Go ahead and manipulate the equation x+y=z where x is 3 and y is 4, and come up with a variation where z is 9. No please, go ahead and try it. Because if you do, you single-handedly broke math and every single scientific result that we know of is no longer valid. 

So no, you can't just be REALLY clever and do some special math and come up with a way to travel faster than light.  

And for reference, Newtonian mechanics are an approximation of the relativistic mechanics for slow velocities. There is nothing that General Relativity said was possible that Newtonian mechanics said it was impossible. It defined things that were undefined by Newton.

I think Orbin is on the track.

From the video Description : ...And the series continues. Much like the ""Sinus"" playalong, I had a couple of days in between sessions to spend how I chose and figured I'd rehearse this bugger a few times. ""The Walk"" is the first Periphery tune I ever heard, learned/eventually 'Orbinated', and is one of two tunes with which I was requested to audition. Of course, this was back in the old days when Jake Veredika was the vocalist; this version was released after I had left and features the mighty Chris Barretto.

If I had to quantify, I'd estimate about 90% of these parts were composed between when I joined -- Sept '06 -- and 2007, with the remaining bits and some trimmings added sometime up until I embarked to record at Audio Hammer (that story is recounted in my ""Project 15"" video). Because of this, some of this stuff certainly feels stale and I'd probably do a few things differently. However, I consider these performances 'snapshots' of my progress from the past, both developmentally and creatively, only executed with my current facility.","1420070806"

This way, you have a more or less captive consumer base that has several distinctions that make it better than imported goods.
Locally produced.
Better for your business.
Better for other cooperative businesses.
Better for the environment(locally produced)
Incomes tied to productivity.
Incentivised to do better to improve production.
Engaged, responsible, and free of banks and corporations.

"EverythingScience","t5_2zlwp","If scramjet engines were developed for surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles, the missiles would be able to outrun the aircraft because the missiles:    

 * could withstand higher G-forces than the manned aircraft, both in acceleration and manouvering    

 * could have a higher airspeed as they have a smaller cross-sectional area for their fuselage, thus reducing aerodynamic drag    

 * other factors limiting airspeed, such as heating from air friction would be less of a problem as the missile only has to last long enough to intercept its target

Furthermore, since the manned aircraft is being deployed into hostile territory it is possible that a dense air defence environment could launch missiles from two or more sites to surround an intruding aircraft, so that whatever direction the intruder took to evade a missile it would face another one.

A dense air defence system could include jamming to prevent the target detecting the approach of missiles.

Turning away from a missile approaching head-on at Mach 6+ will involve a turn with a large radius if the pilot is to avoid excessive G-forces, thus the missile could out-manouver it.

A nuclear-tipped missile such as the [Boeing Bomarc](http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/bomarc.htm) with its 10 kiloton warhead has a much larger kill radius than a conventional explosive/shrapnel missile, so it is not necessary to get closer than a couple of kilometers to make a kill. (Deployed in the US in the 1960s.)

Some of the points I have made are irrelevant if hypersonic drone aircraft were used by the attacking forces, but others still stand. Also, isn't a hypothetical enemy likely to have their own scramjet-powered aircraft to use as interceptors?","1420070811"

"PHP","t5_2qh38","I'm likely -1 on this proposal. I've held a different position in the past, but by now I'm thoroughly convinced that if we introduce scalar typehints, they should be strict. No wiggling, no casting.

Apart from being consistent with the existing behavior of typehints and being what the majority of the vocal community wants, it is also possible to reason about strict typehints statically.

This means that an IDE or other tool will be able to perform meaningful analysis based on typehinted functions. E.g. if you pass the result of a `string` function to an `int` parameter, your code is definitely wrong and you can be told so. Loose (casting) typehints do not offer this possibility, because a string can be or can not be a valid input to an int parameter depending on the exact value.

For the same reason loose typehints are also more fragile. Code that worked in casual testing during development will fail in production when unexpected, improperly validated user input is encountered. With strict typehints on the other hand it is very likely that code working with one input will also work with all other possible inputs, because the type check is not value-dependent.

The ability to statically check typehints is rather important to me. I think much of the usefulness of this feature would be lost without the ability to check correct usage with tooling.","1420070811"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Your second post affirmed your previous ""I don't think"" statement as factual proof. A statement that begins with I don't think is an opinion not a factual statement.

With the amount of energy my comments have generated inside of you, you could've gone and verified my recollections.



&gt;In reviewing the thread I see you responded with your obsession about rich white women having bareback sex due to free access to contraception.

That's a mischaracterization by you because we operate on different levels intellectually.  If one were to make an argument against a liberal policy, how would that be framed to be effective?  What do rich people, white people, and government being involved in peoples bedrooms tend to do to peanut-brained liberal foot soldiers?  So I crafted that argument as a form of argumentative Judo.   The bareback sex aspect was just to trivialize the mandate and boil it down to it's essence.  Easier to digest for the weak and small minded.  Clearly that high level of cerebralism was lost on you.


&gt; I don't know how women are protected from STD's by allowing men to not use a condom? I guess you think rich white women are not concerned with STD's?

If you're wearing a condom, you have no need for other forms of birth control.  Another simple truth seemingly lost on todays liberal youth who demand others sacrifice so they can get free sexual conveniences for their vaginas.


&gt;Your comparison of boat insurance to health insurance indicates a complete detachment from health issues. Obviously nobody knows when/if they will need medical care.

Firstly, review your statement.  You stated in the affirmative, if you knew you and yours didn't need a hospital stay, then you would gladly pay for yours and my families insurance.

If you knew you were never going to need a hospital stay, what would you be buying health insurance for?

Just as people without boats do not purchase boat insurance.  Further, the way you framed your  statement suggests some weird understandings about insurance.  What do you think the difference is between boat insurance and health insurance, other than the obvious?


&gt;Yes through the HARP program I have paid for people who either bought over priced homes they could not afford or used their homes as piggy banks when valuations were obviously crazy.

Weird comparison as HARP was a  safety net policy and free contraception is an entitlement.  Do you understand the difference between those two things?


&gt; If the question was not asked I don't know how it proves anything regarding cost being a factor for those questioned. We could say those who created the questions did not consider it to be a big factor.

Do you know how these types of studies are conducted?  Do you think the researchers at the CDC designed this decades long study with a fatal flaw and missed price?


&gt;You apparently feel entitled to complain without learning enough about the issueS (there are many and any solution will produce winners and losers)

What do you think I am ignorant of?  You're the one who thought free contraception for middle class and rich women was to solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies.  To whit, poor women who already have free contraception are the ones who have problems with it.


&gt;to even offer any type of solution.

Who would I offer it to?  What sort of outcome do you envision  that work would produce?

  
&gt; I am guessing you would be at the head of the line to then complain about government debt.

We're talking about the contraception mandate right?  How do you think people being forced to buy contraception insurance from private companies adds to the national debt in a manner to which I would go into a line to complain about?

&gt;I am guessing a small increase in unwanted pregnancies taken to term would add more to medical costs.

If I were to force people to act on behalf of others, I would prefer evidence to support that act.  Not guesses.  But that's just me.

What happens is ""dirt"" gets removed from what youre washing in the machine and goes into the water during agitation.  The surfactant binds to the ""dirt"" sort of like it being trapped in a little bubble.  So when the water drains the ""dirt"" goes with it.

 &gt;Doing bonuses based on review scores is a way to protect the developer in the eventuality that the developers do their jobs, but the publishers screw them over -- and the result is a critical darling with no sales. The DEVELOPERS fight to get those into the contracts when they are being negotiated. 

I don't understand how a Metacritic score is a reasonable way to gauge a game's popularity approval or critical praise.  I mean if a publisher can't make the judgement that a game like New Vegas is being received ell just because of  difference in decimals, what business does he have selling games.

In this case, you can call Rockwell Tech Support and have them move the license to an internet activation.  If you have the master disk, you can use the license transfer tool to move the license back to the disk and then transfer it to the new computer, but this can be a pain and you need a floppy drive.

If it uses FactoryTalk Activation Manager, you can release the license back to Rockwell's server and then download the license to the new computer.

These are the ""legal"" options.  There are other not-so-legal ways to transfer the license as well.

I think your best bet is to call Rockwell Tech Support and have them help you transfer the license.  I don't think you need a tech support contract for license issues, but I could be wrong about that.","1420070826"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had two awesome best friends in high school - Jim and Rick.  We were all into video games.  We all loved cars.  It was amazing.  But near the end of high school Jim dropped out.

After high school we went our separate ways and went to different colleges and what not.  Jim stayed in our home town and went to a local college.  Rick moved out west to live with family and went to college out there.  I moved East and went to a college at the suggestion from a high school councilor.

Jim had trouble in college.  I have no real understanding of why but I think he just had a hard time sticking with it.  Eventually he finished I found out so good on him for that.

Rick followed in his dad's footsteps and pursued a career in the same field.  I still talk to Rick and we send each other gifts at Christmas and keep in touch with each other's family.

I went back to my home town a few years after I left just to see my folks and hang out with old friends.  Jim &amp; his friends wanted to go hang out at Walmart.  That was the nail in the coffin.  I was cool to go get some food or sit around and play video games.  But hanging out at Walmart was just not something I was interested in ever doing.  I knew at that point we had grown too far apart.  I don't recall when but at some point during those later years Jim got in my face about how I thought I was better than him.  That was hurtful honestly but I think he was lashing out at me for having escaped that little town.

I heard a while back that Jim had pursued a career with his dad and I was really honestly proud of that.  I hoped that he had done something good and found something he could be passionate about.  Then recently I found out he works at some department store.

I am not mad at Jim or anything.  He chose his path in life.  But I am not willing to be friends with someone who picks their path and then screams at me for doing something different.","1420070827"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;you seem to be saying that what Paul calls the ""Oracles of God"" are an historical record of God's involvement in human history. So, it might follow, that if the human history depicted in these records isn't really history, than God's involvement in human history--particularly the people of Israel--is called into question.

Yes and no.  It's certainly not a historical record in the modern, Western sense of ""history,"" but dismissing it as entirely fictional (or metaphorical) does call into question God's involvement with humanity.  That Paul presents the OT as ""written for our instruction"" does not mean it cannot be based in real events.  We learn from what those before us have done and we pass on our stories to others--but only certain, meaningful stories get passed on, rather than every last detail or event of our lives.

&gt;Is it not, rather, that whatever the historical veracity of the events depicted in the book of Job, the Christian is better, stronger, wiser, and more well-equipped for his journey with the real, historical Jesus Christ, the Son of God?

I'm not sure we can rightly draw a dichotomy between a metaphorical or fictional OT and a historical Christ.  The Bible certainly makes no such distinction within itself.  What does it mean to say Jesus Christ is ""the Son of God"" if that God has no history?","1420070828"

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Good ADM on that one. It should take very little icing possibility to scrap a flight, unless you can absolutely guarantee yourself &gt;37F air below to dive into along your route of flight. Most icing is not a big deal when you can just descend and melt it off. It is a huge, life threatening deal when you have nowhere to go.

As far as non-winter threats, the two main concerns are precipitation inside a cloud formation and winds inside a cloud formation. Precip can be picked up by radar, so ATC can give you a heads up. If they say ""light precip"", no big deal. Moderate precip, try to find a divert around it but probably okay. Heavy/extreme, find somewhere else or turn around. If you have XM weather onboard, it tends to be an overly sensitive radar picture. Fly through green/yellow layers no problem, just avoid anything red or worse. ForeFlight stratus (ADS-B weather) more closely mirrors what ATC sees. Try to avoid yellow and do NOT fly through red. If you see lightning strikes, 20nm minimum divert around it.

For winds inside clouds, best resource is PIREPs because our technology can't really show you what's happening beyond a forecast, but even PIREPs aren't that great when they're 10 minutes old. Pick the cloud that is the shortest; the thicker and taller it is, the more energy it has inside. I try to guesstimate and avoid anything more than a few thousand feet tall. If it has an anvil shaped top then it's a no-go.

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","I've heard the opposite about cost when it comes to Germany, but that's not from personal experiences. Buses in Glasgow are always late, definitely, but the cheap price makes up for it. A big reason why buses are expensive here in Sweden is because there is virtually no competition. Each ""province"" has a local bus service controlled by that province, so they can rack up the prices to their heart's content, while still being paid for by taxes. This can be seen as both positive or negative, e.g my local one decided to raise their ticket prices this year in order to afford refurbishing some stations and bus stops. However, if I'm unhappy with my local bus service or their routes don't suit my needs, I can't take my money elsewhere. ","1420070832"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","My mom got me one, finally, after months of begging, for Christmas. A Diva cup. 

To be fair, it wasn't that hard a sell on my awesome hippie mom, but my dad wasn't at all reasonable and that's where the money came from. I would have got it (A Mooncup, actually, seems preferable, and the replacement in roughly ten years will be a MCUK) myself if I had a credit card and didn't find it insulting I have to pay for my necessities at 17. 

I was actually excited for my period. I'm using it right now, and it's fucking wonderful. It took me literally four hours to get it in the first time (I hadn't read the part about holding the fold *as low on the cup as possible*, and it kept popping open too soon), but I'm on the second day now and you can't feel it at all when you get it in right (admittedly I'm gonna need practice, there is *very* slight pressure when you do it wrong), no leaking (I slept naked last night! No diaper panties! No Japanese sheets! It was a fucking miracle!), and having a mL amount for just how little blood menstruation really is is really cool.

And not the 'you can't even feel a tampon!' lies. You really can't. And you really can feel confident you won't ruin your panties. Until you get it down pat, even the leaking is minimal, one of the liners you have left over will last the whole day.



And I've read everything I can on them, and they truly are safe if used with proper care- washing your hands, cleaning it, and leaving it in the cool carrying bag that nobody would be 'haha you're gonna put it in your *vagina* ha ha nasty' in public at a glance, unlike a pad or tampon. TSS, pad rash, heavier flow, exacerbated cramps, deposits and drying, none of that shit. And all you have to go through is a bit of frustration and blood at first if you're not a natural, like me.

I will bookmark this page and donate when I'm a real grown up with a job. 

I wish this would saturate pop culture already. Believe it or not, but I heard about this from Laci Green, had to do weird internet research to make sure it was legit and safe, and buy one at an overpriced health food store.

My siblings are weirdly critical and cynical about my menstrual cup journey, despite being raised by a hippie, somehow, and have made me feel ashamed and outcasted for my new change and  me trying to tell them about how cool it is. My little sisters' best friend, who I can say is generally a nice girl, vehemently told me not to dump it in the sink because 'I use that too', like it's any of her goddamn business what I do, and like it would affect her anyway. I can say fuck them and laugh, but I'm sorry to say some people *can't*.

TL:DR; I am a menstrual cup user and I think everyone should be given the option. They should be more widespread. This wasn't in any of my learning about sexual health even though it's the best.","1420070833"

"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","You're gonna get a lot of answers, but as someone who's played since launch, this is what I know:

Look at all the Crucible Faction vendors. See which have the weapons you like the most. Buy one of their Bonds, or whatever Titan's wear to gain rep.

Mostly, and before you grind any Faction's rep, get your Vanguard rep up to at least level 3. That's gonna take a while, but it will give you access to the Light level 33 gear, and the weapons as well. It's crucial.

The easiest way to get planetary materials is by trading in Crucible or Vanguard marks. 10 marks gets you 20 of whatever material, but this might not be feasible until you get better gear, You're gonna need those marks. Until you have the gear, google some videos on best farming runs on each planet, you can get a lot REAL fast with the right loop.

Go to destinylfg.net for parties. It's a great tool. Seriously, raids, weekly, nightfall, anything. 

If you have other questions, try searching this subreddit for answers, if you can't find it still, we'll gladly answer for ya.

Good luck out there Guardian.","1420070836"

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","Your doctor's recommendation is good. I work in a related field and I highly recommend you take your doc's advice and see someone. You can specify that you want to see a woman if that will make you more comfortable, and that's perfectly understandable. You won't be seeing a ""dirty old man"", you'll be likely seeing someone much like me. Let them know you've been sexually assaulted, and I promise they will have experience dealing with that. You can look up selfcare for vaginismus too. The pain is caused by an involuntary spasming of the muscles, so massage can really help. You don't have to have someone else do that. If you're using your hands you can use coconut oil, which feels nicer than lube. Try to relax the muscles without any penetration. If you get to the point of being able to insert a finger gently great, you can gently massage the muscles from inside as well. Don't focus on trying to insert anything though, just try to get things relaxed. You can also do kegels and as you let go of the contraction focus on actually letting the muscles you just tightened relax fully. Take a minute or two between contractions to see if you can let the muscles release any further. A physical therapist can teach you more exercises, and explain how to use dilators. There is options there besides having them even touch you if you're more comfortable not being touched by others. Just tell them what you are and aren't comfortable with, and work from there. 

I'm glad to hear that your partner isn't pushing you. Now take him at his word and stop pushing yourself to the point of tears! You want to be able to have a happy sex life, he wants to be able to have a happy sex life, and the route to that is patience and taking things at a pace that lets you learn how to enjoy sexual stuff without negative feelings. Focus on the stuff you can do and feel good about. You said you're okay doing pictures? Awesome, take some really great ones for him!

In the meantime please do look into that support group if counselling isn't an option. Many are moderated, and they will help steer you back to focusing on your own stuff. Let them know if that's something you need help with.

Personally, if an airline thinks they can make money from Jews who want a ""men only"" section, that's their business.  The laws preventing that can be warped to serve any kind of negative thing, and I think the market should say whether that is doable or not, not a law.

It's similar to how Hooters can only really hire female wait staff.  Or ""men's clinics"" can hire only men because a man wouldn't feel comfortable talking to a woman at a ""men's health"" place.  Same way the market usually decides that female obgyns get the most patients.","1420070840"

&gt; In fact, the term 'zero knowledge' is so appealing that it leads to problems. People misuse it, assuming that zero knowledge must be synonymous with 'really, really secure'. Hence it gets tacked onto all kinds of stuff -- like encryption systems and anonymity networks -- that really have nothing to do with true zero knowledge protocols.

And it drives me crazy.

I just want to play some ducking tournaments and I don't want to have to go through a third party. Just change the stupid matchmaker. Or add to it. I don't care. But laddering is fucking stupid. The grind is absurdly pointless in hearthstone. ","1420070848"

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","1. I'd level your Vanguard up to at least rank 3 before anything else so that you will be able to buy the legendary armor and weapons with Vanguard Marks.  If you like playing the Crucible, you could level up your Crucible rep or any of the factions (which all take Crucible Marks), but it's definitely not something you need to be doing.  I'm level 31, about to hit 32, and I hardly ever play the Crucible.

2. No, I'd highly recommend getting Vanguards to rank 3 at least before doing any of the factions.  After that it's basically just personal preference.

3. The easiest way to get materials nowadays is to buy them from the Vanguard Quartermaster or Crucible Quartermaster.  They can be bought at a rate of 10 Vanguard / Crucible Marks for 20 materials.  If you want to save your marks for weapons and armor though, riding around in patrol is the other main way.  You can also occasionally obtain them from bounties or completing the Daily Heroic Story.  From the time the game came out until a couple weeks before the DLC, riding around in patrol was the only way to get materials at all, and the patch that introduced the other methods was a godsend.

4. Best places to look are /r/fireteams, DestinyLFG.net, or just around this subreddit.  I'd offer to play with you but I'm still on the 360.","1420070851"

You talk about movement options as if they're some race of people you want to exterminate. 

I have no idea why you have this kind of attitude when talking about something as simple as Smash, and your immediate dismissal and stereotyping of someone based on a post that was hardly even an opinion is frankly disgusting. Not once did I say I like Melee, nor have I ever said I like Melee, because I don't. This is the internet, you have as much time as you need to type a response so there's no excuse for jumping to conclusions that quickly.","1420070851"

"Schizoid","t5_2qxro","After going home, I kept up the self-improvement. The work really begins when we get back to our real lives. Twenty-plus years of living as a depressive near-hermit with significant socialization problems left its mark.

Four years later though, I'm doing quite well. I've learned a *lot* of human relations skills, sales skills, mediation, psychology, meditation, and various more esoteric things. Done a *lot* of personal development courses. I now have a relatively high-level sales job and am considered by my colleagues to be extremely good at it. (My style mainly works off mediation.)

I lost contact with my love for a couple of years. She has her own significant mental health challenges and I insisted on taking her with me two years later to do the trip, which [went badly](http://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/1ekj8u/hamilton_southers_lecture_at_burning_man_2012/ca27955) and she walked out of my life. However we have very recently been talking again. 

I don't know if we'll ever be together as a couple. But it doesn't matter. She is a dear friend and always will be - I was basically converted, by the nearest thing to a god, from a simulacrum without love at all into a real person who loves her, and I *can't* not love her. I don't have to exert control over what exactly the terms of our relationship are. However I can set boundaries now. I'm open to being in love with someone else, and committing to them, and I am taking steps toward that goal.

Anyways. There's my story as requested.

Will it work for you? I have no idea. I suggest that it's likely. If you do do it, please report back. Further data is useful.","1420070852"

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","This is an amusing post; and I feel like a lot of people making similar posts about ED on here these days would do well to look back on that.  :p   

Back in those days, it took me something like a day of playing to complete my first successful flight from lave to another system, including docking.  But once I did it once, then it started getting *a lot* easier.   But you had to work to earn that sense of accomplishment.  It was *hard*, and so you really earned the satisfaction of even that simple achievement.  

And at that point, a whole galaxy...eight of them, actually...opened up before me.   And I was hooked;  I didn't stop until I made *ELITE*.    I was a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a pirate, a pawn and a theif, and occasionally even an honest trader.  I would do the Reidquat run as a warm-up, and then look for a *really* dangerous system to hunt in.  Basically, I practiced until I was actually good at it, instead of quitting just because some feel-good sense of 'winning' wasn't handed to me on a platter like games of today do.  

Back then games required real skill, and if you couldn't cut it, you lost the game, period.    And a little imagination helped, too; wireframe, or simple solid-colour polygons give you a canvas, and your mind had to fill in the details.   That is not really encouraged as much in the big games of today.   

And for God's sake, if I see another post about how Elite is bad and should be more like WoW or Eve, I am just going to have to murder someone.   IF you think either of those things, it simply isn't the game for you, you know?   

I wonder if any  other old-timers are kicking it in Bebece these days?  Is that system even in ED?  I guess I'll have to take a look.

We broke up a couple months later. 

Then we got back together the next year after chatting online again. We started dating again the summer after I finished grade 10.

Most of the jobs I was looking at would have me doing much more field work than lab work. I suppose it depends on the company. Some firms don't even have their own lab, so their geotechs spend more time doing QA on the implementation of geotech designs and interpreting the lab reports from other firms. In some cases, geotechs do a lot of computer modeling for slopes and seepage. Now, what the interviewers told me to expect, and what they actually will have me do could be two different things, but maybe it will help you.

I'm getting a little tired of Eccleston's attitude towards the show and the fans. He wasn't even on the BBC flashback show about his own Doctor. He can't say he didn't know what he was getting into when he accepted the role. 

If he doesn't want to be part of the show, then the BBC should retcon him out of it. have a multi Doctor story where Capaldi goers back and keeps Hurt from regenerating at the end of DoTD. Hurt would then be THE 9th Doctor and go on to meet Rose and they could show scenes of Hurt being the Doctor in the stories of season 1. 

The story would end with Hurt regenerating into Tennant. Capaldi would then realize that the change in his timeline makes him the 12th regeneration with none left. So this sets in place the quest for Gallifrey and a new life cycle.","1420070859"

Nothing turns non-vapers off quicker than the assholes who stick out their chest and go on a furious rant about ""It's not smoking and there's no laws saying I can't vape here!"". I've only been vaping for about a month now (smoked for 32 years) and have already had an unpleasant experience with two of this type of self righteous douchenozzle. If you're a former smoker don't vape where you wouldn't smoke. Easy as that.

I've been lucky so far. The 3 B&amp;M and online vendors that I have purchased from are quite knowledgeable and know their business. I wholeheartedly agree with the view that a B&amp;M that sells bongs and hookah right alongside their vaping equipment gets a pass from me. Never been in a head shop before and I don't plan on going in to one to buy my juice and vaping supplies.

2. Void Keys - Since we're technically raiding different towers and they aren't in some... Orokin Space Suburb, we really should be looking in different areas with higher rates or different tables altogether.

3. Void bosses - I mean, why not. Could just have a key hidden in each void mission, they'd have a lot of options for what the mission itself could be, an optional boss rush or you just search and cherry pick the boss you want (be it for the fun or the drops.)

Question #4 Reddit fireteams on the right panel is a great resource for grouping up and you can use destiny lfg app/website as well but I've had better luck with solid groups from reddit fireteams

I rank up new monarchy and dead orbit personally because of the sweet dlc handcannons you can get from the reward packages once you rank up to 3 and beyond. It is easier to level up a faction to 2 to get your gear because you get rep from both your vanguard and crucible bounties but you should still level up vanguard to 2 as well because you can only use vanguard marks with the vanguard person and not with the other factions as I'm sure you have noticed by now.

It's an odd thing to do in Florida, but I wouldn't have even noticed had the man who lived there not been completely insane. Standing outside talking at a normal volume on a Saturday afternoon? Called the cops to complain about noise. Closed our wrought iron gate when we got home from work? Called the cops again. Barbecue in the mid afternoon on a holiday? Yep, cops again. That time he told the police that responded that he was pretty sure my husband was an illegal alien. They laughed.

I was surprised, even having experienced how insane this guy was before, and told him that the dogs weren't barking, and I didn't understand why he was upset. He started shouting that their tags are jingling, and their nails clicked on the concrete and then screamed over and over, ""It isn't fucking fun living here,"" punching a palm tree, and grabbed and started shaking my fence. That time *I* called the police. 

We moved shortly after that, largely because it was almost impossible to live there and enjoy our (beautiful) backyard without him going ballistic, and I was afraid of how far it would escalate after seeing him beat the shit out of a *tree*. Our landlord called us a couple months later to make a statement about his behavior. They apparently had to sue the guy because he started harassing the next tenants the same way, and they said that they couldn't live there like that, forfeited their deposit, and left, leaving the house vacant.

"Justrolledintotheshop","t5_2tteh","Welding cast is always a pain. The sand used in the casting process always manages to get into the base metal. The metal also has large pores that trap all sorts of crud like oil, grease, coolant, dirt, and who knows what else. 

You die-grind the area about to be welded and do a hot bead with medium filler, which will look like crap and full of crud and porosity. You then grind all that crap off, and weld again. You keep doing that til you get a GOOD full metal weld in. Then move forward to the next section of build-up and do that again, and again, and again, and again.

So you actually weld the same area sometimes 4-5 times buttering the base metal til you get good fusion and good metal. Then as you buildup some of the crud floating on the top of your previous bead will cause problems on the next bead, so you float it up to brush/grind it off.

It's a pain. Lots of wire brushes, lots of die grinding, lots of acetone. It's mostly in the prep work , the welding itself doesn't take very long.","1420070865"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Well, explain to me the differences in results then, because you haven't done so as of yet.

An opt-out system requires a lot of paperwork and process serving, and legal judgments. It is also difficult to manage - what if a woman doesn't tell a man she's pregnant, then later gives birth and claims child support? He says he was never told, she says that he was told. Now you have a legal case, etc. 

An opt-out system would eliminate all of that. No process serving is needed. If a woman doesn't tell the man about pregnancy, well, he can't be forced to pay. So there is no incentive to abuse the system - in fact, there is no way to abuse the system.

&gt;In fact, they have to do with a system which actively compels everyone else to pick up the tab. 

An opt-in system does not solve the money issue. It solves the practicality issue of how financial abortions could feasibly work.

&gt;You're arguing that forcing someone to pay for the child is wrong in one circumstance, but totally fine in another.

Requiring everyone to pay a very small amount for all kids (taxes), is just. Forcing a man to pay a large amount for a kid he never wanted, after he was raped or deliberately deceived, is unjust.

Some might suggest Dolph Ziggler but, considering that even he isn't actively going after the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in kayfabe, he's nowhere near where Bryan was last year.

Unless the west coast and east coast have suddenly become further apart, the path your packets are taking to reach their destination is to blame.
  
East Coast is seeing increased ping time and packet loss because TWC/Verizon/Whoever are playing the same blackmail games they played with Netflix. They are intentionally routing your traffic through longer paths until Riot choses to pay them for a direct ""prime"" route.  
  
So instead of practicing pointless upvote activism, call your Congressman and express your frustration. Make it clear you support Net Neutrality. Call your ISP and complain. Basically, do *anything* except what you're doing now.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","We've covered this ground before, so I'll skip straight a newer point:

A Missouri state senator claims that [requiring a spouse/father's permission to get an abortion should be constitutional because that spouse will eventually be forced to pay child support](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/republican-wants-women-get-permission-father-having-abortion). Essentially, he believes that one person's bodily autonomy ends where another's financial rights begin.

&gt;Asked about Casey v. Planned Parenthood, a 1992 Supreme Court decision striking down a requirement that a woman inform her husband if she haves an abortion, Brattin says he doesn't believe the ruling affects his bill. Because Missouri has laws requiring men to pay child support during a pregnancy, he contends, a bill requiring a man's involvement in an abortion should be constitutional.

Suppose that the U.S. gets a right-leaning court after 2016, and that argument (your rights end where my rights begin) holds up constitutionally. Suppose that the U.S. Supreme Court did rule that government-enforced compulsory child support ended the argument that abortion was nothing more than an exercise in self-autonomy.

Would you support legal paternity surrender then?","1420070871"

I don't think we know enough about her character to say one way or another (which might be a problem with the show). I could as easily interpret her projected caring, not to mention her stated motives, as a manipution to gain power. She seems to see people as if they are chess pieces, including her own fiance, that can and should be sacrificed if need be in order to ""win the game"". I'm more inclined to think that Kuvira's behavior fits the idea that she became the ""Great Uniter"" to make *herself* feel invincible, and that delusion is what led to her downfall.

Now, are there good motivations buried underneath there? Sure. I think when Kuvira started out, she didn't plan on losing her grip on reality. But that wasn't to be.","1420070876"

EDIT: If your budget stretches, get the Asus X99 Deluxe. The built in wifi and Bluetooth is apparently Broadcom based and works in OSX.  I couldn't find any info on it at the time and figured I could add wifi and Bluetooth via an add in card pretty simply. Of course just after I'd ordered my parts the news came in..

.......

I used a combination of two guides to get things setup. The first part of this guide 
http://www.tonymacx86.com/yosemite-desktop-guides/143849-haswell-e-x99-motherboard-temporary-guide-os-x-10-10-a.html stopping at ""post installation"".

Then switching over to the clover guide for the remainder - located here: http://www.rampagedev.com/?page_id=55

Boot flags needed for everything until you have the Nvidia drivers are ""npci=0x2000 kext-dev-mode=1 nv_disable=1"". Boot flags after the Nvidia web drivers are installed are ""npci=0x2000 kext-dev-mode=1 nvda_drv=1"" 

The only thing I'm yet to get working is audio. The guy who writes the patches seems reluctant to provide clear and concise instructions, or answers to any questions from the multiple people I've seen that are also unable to get it to work, so still looking for a fix.

* The Instalment Title: 5uper 5mash bros: 5on of 5uper 5mash

* Mechanics Feels: Like Melee dammit!

* One new gameplay mechanic: Aerial Collisions - Bodyblock foes trying to return to stage. Using a grab in midair makes your character a dead weight blocking your opponent's recovery.

* Goodbye to Classic mode entirely, because it's not even classic anymore.

* Instead, say hello to Super Smash Mode, it's like classic but with always-on online interactions. Will your next match be a minigame, computer players, or another human? Who Knows? How Exciting!

* One new exploitable glitch advanced tech: Ledge-state extension - make the game think you are on the ledge for as long as you remain airborne off the ledge. How do you do this and how does it help the game? Who knows? it's emergent gameplay. I'd say just put L-canceling back, but that's not ""New""

* Remove One exploitable glitch advanced tech: Umm, all the things I would have said were fixed from 3ds to wii U. So I guess even less dash-dancing? Pivots seems sorta intentional, really.

* new Nintendo fighters: Some new 9th gen pokemon (probably the fire/fighting starter), the default protagonist from Mother 4: Mother Online Reborn [Japan release only], Adam Malkovich from Metroid: Other M, Mii Ninja and Mii Superhero

* 2 new 3rd-Party: Raz from Psychonaughts and The Kid from Bastion. Nintendo finally has cared about indie devs in the next 10 imaginary years.

* 2 characters from previous titles need to be removed: Dark Pit obviously shouldn't be in the game, but he stays around as an assist trophy to keep Shadow company. Dr. Mario went 5 feet off stage and fell, he's now 5 feet under.

* One returning cut veteran: Wolf. Now not even sort-of a clone, but with an even worse VA than Fox.

* One brand new stage gimmick to be used: Damaging/healing environment - In the Metroid Prime: Echoes stage set on Aether, you are slowly healed in the light beacons and hurt outside the when the stage transforms to Dark Aether. [Dark Aether is also the final smash of Dark Ike. Please, understand]

* 4 new items: Rock, Paper, and Scizzors. The classic game comes to Smash Bros. The proper tool is a OHKO on opponents. (rock beats scizzors, etc) Also, Dummy Smash Balls. They look real, but they explode in your face when you break them (like how lightning and timers can backfire)

* 4 cut items: No more Gust Bellows, grass (why is that a thing anyway?) Beetles or Drills.

* One new final boss: **Reggie**","1420070877"

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I'm not running away with anything. It outright says ""would that be important?"" and I say ""yes, in many or even most cases it is"". As a counterpoint, though, *you're* extrapolating quite a bit. I don't sit down with the intent of deciding what the author is not being inclusive of, but I am acutely aware of things. Precisely because I'm *not* in a position to take it for granted, which is due to my own identifiers and variables.

Your assumptions aside--which is ironic when trying to call me out on extrapolation--my point is *not* that I should be catered to. My point is that gender is one of many things that *does* define who we are. And the further away from ""White, straight, cisgender, male"" you are, the more those identifiers define you. It's not about catering to people who aren't white, straight, cisgender or male, though. It's about the fact that

&gt;I write women as if they were men

Is poor advice. And to act like gender has no impression on who you are is foolish. Actually, I'm gonna cut the diplomacy: Acting like someone's gender doesn't matter is fucking bullshit and anyone who's interacted with other human beings should know better. For fucks sake, we wouldn't even be having this conversation if gender didn't matter.

And cut the ""you're just too much of an activist"" bullshit. I'm sorry, that's a terrible fucking argument to make in the first place, especially when it's not relevant here. I mean, again, you're making my point. People wouldn't have to be activists if this shit didn't matter, so *clearly it does*. Do you know what it's like to realize that people don't think you exist? To read a book and go ""hey, guess people like me can't be heroes"". Why the fuck do you think well written female fantasy characters are such a Big Deal in the first place? You wanna know what's tiring? Going to your escapism place and realizing that just like in the real world you're the butt of a joke. You think I like watching fucking *Men in Black III* and there's a throwaway joke where a runway model says ""hey"" with a deep voice? For fucks sake, try putting yourself in someone else's shoes. Imagine ""if I had to put up with this bullshit every single fucking day"" would I be so ready to brush it off?

That is, again, a digression, though, because my point, that you so clearly missed, is that gender has a fucking impact on who we are as people, because *it clearly matters to the world writ large*. If gender wasn't an important part of who we are, Robin Hobb wouldn't have wrote that post. If gender wasn't important to who we are, the post she read that made her want to write that wouldn't have existed.

Yes, in a vacuum, ""is gender important to who you are?"" wouldn't be a yes. But we don't live in a fucking vacuum. Vasquez from *Alien* was a part written for a man. It would also be a *completely different character* if it was played by a man. There would not be a fucking TVTrope [about the fact that strong female characters dying named after her](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VasquezAlwaysDies). And it pisses me off that this is a conversation that keeps coming up and people keep asking ""does this matter?"" Of course it fucking matters or it wouldn't keep coming up.

This isn't an activist thing. Among activist circles I'm considered a fucking troll. This is common fucking sense Jesus fucking Christ I would have expected one of the most respected female fantasy authors to realize that her gender is pretty fucking important to her story because her own story would be completely different if she was a man.","1420070878"

A Google search yields the class documentation as the first result, followed by the release notes and WWDC sessions that described it in detail.

Searching the Apple Developer website also yielded the class documentation, release notes, etc.

Your assertion:
&gt;Try to find a single page about NSSplitViewController. None. 

Would seem to indicate that you did not ""try"" very hard at all. If you depend on using Xcode for class level documentation, perhaps you have not been keeping it up to date or have done something to prevent it from updating correctly.

It would be hard to judge exactly what would count as ""using all of one's capacity to help others""--as you said, one might think that we would have to limit ourselves to fulfillment of our most basic needs in order to be worthy of praise for any charitable actions, which intuitively seems wrong.  

I think that it is important to recognize the difference in my capacity and  your capacity for assisting the impoverished (etc) compared to the capacity of someone like Gill Bates.  You correctly point out that there is almost certainly more that you and I could be doing.  But there is no doubt in anyone's mind that you and I do not have anywhere near the capacity to make a significant dent in, for example, world hunger.  And if we wanted to try anyway, we would likely have to limit ourselves to bare necessities.  People like Gill Bates, however, have that capacity, and they can do it while continuing to live a more comfortable life than nearly anyone else on the planet.  So I think that the issue has a lot to do with the excess wealth specifically.  But I would be willing to accept that people like you and I are blameworthy to some extent for not doing more--e.g., for not donating more to charity.  However, it would be to a lesser extent than someone like Gill Bates, since Gill Bates's capacity greatly surpasses ours. 

Edit: replied before seeing your edit 

Edit 2 (after having read your edit, and the NYT article):

I'm inclined to think that the article is right for the most part.  People ought to do more than they are doing.  At the end, they suggested that a person making $50000 has the same obligation as a person making $100000.  They didn't say anything about people making $1-million or $100-million, but presumably they would say that they all should be as close to $30000 as possible.  It seems like it would fit well with that thought, though, that people making $100-million deserve more blame for not limiting themselves to $30000 than people making $50000 do, just in virtue of how much they are missing the target by.  If Person_A makes $1-million each year, and Person_B makes $50000, even if Person_A donates $500000 each year, and Person_B donates $0, Person_A is still missing the target by significantly more than Person_B.

I have a question for you, though.  Why should charitable contributions not be something we consider when evaluating whether or not a person if worthy of praise or of blame?  In what sense are charitable contributions different from that beach scenario? ","1420070880"

"UGA","t5_2s4l0","Apparently I'm in the minority on this, but I have no problem with the charge. He gained unauthorized access to a system and defaced a web site. On the surface, that looks like nothing more than spray painting a UGA sign or something. But the response to this incident will consume significant man hours. That server can't ever be trusted again, so it will have to be rebuilt. A forensic examination will need to take place to ensure that this guy only accessed the calendaring system, and didn't access anything more sensitive. If the systems he touched contained SSNs, then UGA is liable for any identity theft that could occur to the victims (even if they can't directly tie it to this incident). And the time EITS is spending responding to this could easily mean missed deadlines which could require hiring temporary contractors to stay on schedule. 

In short, this ""harmless prank"" will cost the taxpayers of Georgia thousands of dollars. Discouraging this from turning into some kind of tradition is what's important here. Thus the tough charge.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","For many power supplies, the standby power runs from separate circuitry so it is possible for the the standby to work while everything else fails.

A quality power supply will have a number of protection circuits built in, including input and output protection on each rail.

In your case, an easy way for you to test the power supply will be to first remove it, then take a case fan and connect it to one of the 12V connectors.

If you have a bunch of LED that can run from 5V (most LED's designed for flash lights which use 3 AAA batteries, will have LED's rated for 5V, if not then see if you can wire up a fan to the 5V rail, (some fans will spin slowly at 5V, but if they do not, then you can use a boost converter (if you have any).

(most power supplies need a load on at least the 12V rail to remain on.

After that, get a paper clip and short the green and black wire. then using a multimeter, measure the voltages on the 12V and 5V rail.

For the 3.3v rail find any device that can be powered from 3.3V, or use a boost converter.

With some load on the rails, test each rail to make sure the voltage is fine.

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","This is an all-around capable and fairly powerful PC. The GTX 970 will provide bunches of performance &amp; play all of today's games on their [high settings](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-970-maxwell,3941-10.html). 

I don't see any obvious bottlenecks (and for $800, you shouldn't), but if I were to peer into a crystal ball to foresee what you might upgrade first, I'd consider the following:

1) *Will your computing needs change over time?*

If you're mining bitcoins, editing 4K video, doing 3D graphics rendering, or anything CPU/GPU intensive, then sure, you're going to need better parts over time. Your hardware may have to evolve with you.

But 99% of the population don't need that kind of horsepower. If you're playing games, listening to music, using office applications (Microsoft Word, Excel), browsing the internet, editing home video for Youtube, etc. then this computer will last you 4-5 years, no problem.

*2) How quickly will this technology become obsolete?*

I remember when upgrading from a 486 to my first Pentium machine, and it was such a dramatic change. For once. My computer didn't take 5 minutes to load. I felt like I could do anything! But since then, each subsequent generation has ""felt"" less dramatic. 5 years ago, we were introduced to the first-generation Core chips (I believe it was the i7), and many of those machines are still capable of meeting most computing needs today. Why? Because in today's world, software demands less and less from its hardware. Much of the software we use is in the cloud (i.e., GMail, Youtube, etc) and does not ask THAT much of your computer. I don't see that trend changing. Even today, there are few games that utilize [more than 2 threads](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/627258-how-many-average-number-of-threads-does-a-game-needs-regardless-of-simplicity/). Software developers have to think about the ""average PC"", and build games that can be run on Core i7's + SLI cards as well as Core i3's + Geforce 750's. That is also the reason why PC builders will rarely recommend a CPU better than a Core i5 for a build under $1,000.

*3) But what about new technology that already know about today?*

Off the top of my head, 4K is probably your biggest concern. But, it'll take its sweet time in getting here, and when it does, you'll probably want a stronger rig to handle the additional processing. But we just finished getting everyone to HD/1080. I don't think the *mainstream* demand is quite there for 4K. I don't want one. I live in San Francisco, and I don't even know anyone who owns a 4K TV. Even then, this computer can run 4K games *today* (just not on the highest settings). It's one of those things on the horizon to keep an eye on, and I'll jump on that when the time comes. I just don't think that'll be any sooner than 2016.

tl;dr Probably your RAM (jumping up to 16GB) or your SSD (jumping up to 480 GB/1TB). Over the long-run, you could probably get away with a new video card without upgrading any of the other components to give your machine another couple years of life.","1420070885"

As with almost everything, there are risks and benefits to be balanced. Forty thousand years ago didn't eat as much red meat, they didn't eat as much overall, and they had a lot more physical activity than we do now. They didn't live as long either, so long term health didn't matter as much.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Time of Eve at *number two*? ...I mean, I loved it too, and I'd definitely place it within my top twenty movies ^^not ^^that ^^I've ^^watched ^^all ^^that ^^many ^^anime ^^movies but I found it's world-building lacking and it's overall structure a bit stilted, mainly because (I found out later) it's a six-episode ONA that got smushed into a movie-length production.

The characters were mostly very fun and their interactions engaging, and the story had a solid premise being delivered by a worthy first half-hour (or so). I'd thought that with the solid pacing, good humour and sharp attention to detail, it could only get better, but unfortunately it kind of eases off on the pedal at the wrong time. Take the ""old-robot"" scene as an example - I don't remember coming out of that fifteen minute section with any emotional or thought-provoking response. It was just... filler. In a movie. And I'm pretty sure that's a relic of *Eve no Jikan*'s time as an ONA series. Which, if they'd trimmed down to fit the tone of the earlier parts of the movies and focused on creating a complete world, could have been much better.

I'm not going to suggest a replacement Number 2 - not until I've seen all of these movies myself - but I can say that just this past week I've seen more than one Miyazaki movie that delivered far better than *Time of Eve* did. Not that the latter fails; quite the contrary. Like you said in the imgur album, it wholly delves into the characters' actions and beliefs in this similar yet distant world, and in one of the most captivating, enchanting, atmospheric locations I've seen in animation yet - that memorable and *awesome* café.

Still, I'm glad to see it on the list, thought you missed out! And thanks for making my PTW so much larger too! :{D","1420070891"

From /u/monsterpanda's [account](https://www.reddit.com/r/BABYMETAL/comments/2pws0k/personal_review_of_apocrypha_s_toyosu_pit_20141220/)

&gt; Then the projector showed images onto the curtains. We were told a tale, of the legends... and the chosen ones will be witness to the off record tales… They showed us everything since the last Apocrypha event. Glorious **pro shots of LA, Lady Gaga, Heavy Montreal, encore NY, and London**. The Lady Gaga shots were decent, but the LA &amp; NY shows were Legend 1999 quality. But boy, the proshot of London was amazing. Sweeping crane cameras showing Yui waving the flag, shots from the crowd, capturing crowd surfers and the excitement. They really did a good job of capturing the show, on and off stage to make you feel like you were there.

&gt;In all honesty if the show ended there I would have been happy.  

I doubt they would start with a massive box set, they can work their way up to it and sell both the more modest and then the deluxe version later, like new movies which get a bare-bones DVD release and then a deluxe version later on.","1420070892"

"technology","t5_2qh16","There was one ISP in a small town in Northern California where they knowingly oversold the connections in the area which caused constant massive outages or severe latency issues daily, especially when everyone got home from work, and there was nothing we could do except let the customer know ""There is a known issue in the area and call back in the morning if the issue continues.""  Well lo and behold every morning the issue wasn't there because people have left for work so the network wasn't taxed anymore so nothing was done.

There is an ISP in Texas that offers amazing speeds for a ludicrously high price that people paid for because they're the only ISP in miles and they only offer expensive packages.  What the ISP didn't tell their customers is they had a 25 GB data cap and the moment they broke it they got reduced down to dial-up speeds.  Most people would blow through the cap in the first week of the month and so they'd call daily talking about their speeds being knocked to shit.  All we could do, due to the data usage, would be to refer them to their local office who would in turn hang up on the customer and redirect them back to us.

Probably my favorite one was an ISP in... the midwest somewhere.  They sold ""blazing fast"" internet at 50 Mbs down but in actuality the package was a grand 1.5 Mbs down for $100ish a month.  Their nodes were so terrible that looking at them hard could make them knock hundreds of people offline.  Their technicians were so bad they often  hooked to the wrong repeater (I have NO idea how) causing even more issues and if by some miracle the customer actually got online they had a 25 Mbs, yes... 25 megabyte, data cap before they were knocked down to dial-ups.  My companies policy for them was to exclusively refer customers to the local office who in turn never answered.

Now you may say to me ""But that shit is illegal or at the very least immoral"" and I say to you... yes.  Yes it is.","1420070893"

Here are some questions you should ask.

1) Are you trying to scam people?

2) Are you deceptive or dishonest in any way when selling your idea?

3) Is your idea realistic?

4) Do you have a plan on how you are going to spend the funds?

5) Do you have a prototype that properly demonstrates that your idea is feasible, or a well elaborated and supported theoretical basis for your idea?

6) Are your rewards realistic and fair? Will they justify people supporting your project?

7) Do you have a well thought out timeline for your project?

8) Have you properly considered the risks of your project, and listed ways to mitigate those risks?

These are the main questions I can think of. Mostly you just have to be honest. Kickstarters start to become shitty when people know there is a part of their idea that may not work, but stubbornly ignore it in blind, selfish ignorance and attempt to dishonestly cover it up so people will fund them.","1420070896"

You had a mass of armed, revolutionary, idealistic young men who were tired of French occupation, who had fought Japanese occupation, only to be returned to their prior condition of servitude after World War II by the freedom-loving West. So then they fight the French some more, and then they fight the Americans some more, and at some point human nature is what it is. It's not an argument against anything. It's what happens when people are too far gone. 

Post-colonial Taiwan was barely a thing, before it turned into the safe haven for the KMT. I wouldn't consider the KMT as an entity to have ever really been a ""good thing"", and I don't know how much better China would have been had they won the civil war. South Korea was run by an authoritarian dictatorship for quite some time before becoming what it is today. Nowhere near as bad as the North, but still not pretty. Both of those were also under more-or-less military control, on behalf of the democratic powers during the Cold War. And I think a lot of their modern positions are the result of their having been on the right side of the winning side, and developing those trade links and investment pipelines.

Essentially, what Olson discovered and published in his article was not the legal definition of CP, so mod volunteers couldn't really do anything about it without a report to stand on (this is standard practice for 8chan; they'll only delete boards once they've got users complaining or reporting the board in masses). If they were going to delete it, they needed a report to justify deletion of the content.

If Olson wanted this disturbing (but sadly legal) content deleted, he needed to report it or write to an admin about it. Otherwise, the mods cannot do anything to delete it without compromising one of the major ideas which created 8chan: People can post whatever they want, as long as it isn't illegal.

However, I'm not too clear on the subject, so I'll send an email to hotwheels asking the following questions:

- When the posts were deleted.

- What boards they were on.

- Whether there were any reports on the content Olson published.

- Whether the mods had the ground to delete the content without reports.

I'll be back soon with the answers.

"Animesuggest","t5_2ssl0","I actually tried Durarara! 3 times before managing to finish it and to my surprise I actually breezed through it and enjoyed it a lot on my last attempt.

I think it's all about expectations with that show. It has a lot of main characters, and it splits its time up among them pretty close to equally. So the show is ultimately going to spend a lot of time on the characters you just don't care about. For example I liked Izaya a lot, but were just horrendously bored whenever Celty or Semyon was the focus. Which was probably the reason I just fell off the first 2 times since I weren't expecting them to take up so much of the screan time.

Just going in to it knowing that though I think makes all the difference. Sticking with it past the introductory stage you start to see how all the stories just start to play off one another and intertwine, which is going to make the parts with the boring characters a lot better because they start to involve and affect a lot of the characters you actually do care about.

"travel","t5_2qh41","Looking back, 2014 was one of the best years of my life. I was lucky enough to be able to live out a dream of mine: backpacking through Latin America, learning Spanish.

This entire year is memorable for me because each day was so different. Sitting here thinking about it, I decided to run some numbers on my travel this year. I thought you might find this interesting, I did:

Miles Traveled by Bus in Latin America: 13,694

Miles Hitch-hiked in Latin America: 1,128

Hours on planes: 25

Miles traveled by bus in USA: 1134

Miles traveled by car in USA: 780

Days spent traveling by boat: 11

Days spent out of the country: 278

New countries visited: 10

The whole thing was an incredible experience, absolutely unforgettable. What really made it were all the great people I was able to share it with. You know who you are. Thank you all very much. I can only hope for more years like this in my future. I feel blessed.

If I learned anything from this experience it's that life is meant to be enjoyed no matter where you are or what your situation is. Some parts of the trip were a struggle but totally worth it for the overall experience. There is always something positive you can focus on and celebrate. If you have a crazy dream, I say: Go for it. life is too short :)

"Wordpress","t5_2qhjq","A few things - if you have any familiarity with html and css then the job just got half as hard it could be.

This is the kind of question that is too open-ended to get a great answer, because ""asked me to help redo his wordpress site"" still leaves a lot of detail unstated. If it's just a cosmetic change, and a simple one, then the existing theme can be polished via html and css changes to the template files and stylesheets.

If he's wanting significant changes to layout, etc, then it gets a bit more difficult. 

If he's open to the final result being a lot different than what he has, then maybe find an existing theme, learn how to child theme (it's very easy, a one-page tutorial will explain it) and then make changes via the child theme to customize the newer theme.

What is his business, and what is the site supposed to do? What is not doing that he wants it to do? What is it doing satisfactorily?

Or even better, what problem is he trying to solve or opportunity is he trying to take advantage of?","1420070900"

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","Personally I do think they are worth it - once they are broken in. They are a bitch and a half to break in OMFG. I would suggest wearing 2 pairs of thick socks on your feet, blow drying the inside/outside of one boot for two minutes, then stick your foot in it. Do the same to the other boot. Make sure to heat the back of your foot (achilles tendon area) and toes, especially. Walk around with them around your house. Repeat the heating process every 40-60 mins for as many hours as you like. Do this for many, many days, until the boots feel comfortable to wear without the thick socks, etc. Basically the leather is SUPER stiff and you need to soften it by wearing the heck out of your boots. These boots last such a long time and honestly I think they are an amazing price for how long they last (my friend has had hers for 6 years and you cannot tell them apart from my two year olds!). You just really have to be willing to put the effort in. I wear mine with jeans, floral dresses and tights, leggings, whatever. They are extremely versatile and absolutely gorgeous, they are just an absolute pain on your feet until you are used to them, and until they are used to you. 
I have very little advice one ""what to look for in a combat boot"" pretty much I bought mine cause I wanted a pair of combat boots and my friend really liked her Docs so I was like ""eh, ok"". I do love mine but they are definitely a pain to break in and get used to. ","1420070901"

"CombatFootage","t5_2v0c6","If you're not reading my comments, then you obviously have forfeited your right to make a legitimate criticism of what I'm saying, not that you could come up with one it seems. Still, for this comment I'll drop the directs quotations of your post just so you'll at least *read* it, and to give you a break from being made to look a complete idiot quite as much as you have previously.

I'm not believing historians without question, because I've actually studied the topic a bit, wrote on it, disagreed with some and agreed with others, and don't believe in the ludicrous shit you do. My prose isn't bad, trust me, I just like breaking down lengthy crap comments like yours on reddit into small sections because its convenient. By the way your wording is terrible by your own admission and you spell poorly, so if you really want to nitpick about writing style, I'd suggest you do it to someone that is as thick as you are.

I don't sound like an emotionally immature 14 year old, however the comments you make do make you sound like an utterly uninformed Nazi apologist. The assumptions I'm making are not random, they are weighed up judgements about your character based on what you actually *say*. You're completely averting the fact that the stabbed in the back idea is a myth. Benjamin Freeman was an anti-Semitic lobbyist, the fact that you're referencing him tells me a lot about your own beliefs. Either way, the US joined the war for a few reasons. If you're going to blame it on the Jews, at least be honest about it.

Your rant about talking in prose is funny, particularly when you start it out by saying ""You're prose"". I'm not talking to my own argument, I'm talking to you; but with the format we are using I'm trying to address specific parts of your comment in an appropriate manner. I'd rather do that, especially when pointing out the specific errors of your horrid argument, rather than do a lengthy prose piece that I don't need to. 

You're also criticising me for making assumptions when many of those assumptions are completely valid and when you make assumptions yourself (That I am not learned on this subject, or that you know your material and stuff like what semantics means, when you obviously don't). I'm blaming you for what you have said here, in this discussion, and what you have implied. If you're going to repeat the same lingo used by people like Stormfront users then you should expect to be subject to similar criticism. What you said about the burden of proof is similarly whiny nonsense that boils down to this; your feelings are hurt because I've called you out on being blatantly wrong about history. Good to know. You don't understand how burden of proof works anyway.

I'm not making your comments into a multi-comment of some sort either, I'm just addressing individual parts of your comment in more detail. I'm not writing you a prose essay when there is fundamentally no need to do so. I wouldn't write prose in this manner normally and that should be obvious, but you are just desperate now in looking for ways to criticise me because I've called out your argument. The fact of the matter is that this is not a real life conversation or one over the phone; it is a conversation by text communication on an internet content aggregator comments section. Ignoring whole comments because they actually try to add context to their criticism and debunk you in detail is really just an admission that you lack the intellectual capacity to make an argument.

All you're doing I'm afraid is whining. Whining that I'm not treating you with the same legitimacy that I would ascribe to someone who doesn't believe in complete bullshit. You don't owe me evidence or explanation, of course you don't, but I don't owe you the etiquette of a polite academic historical debate when you are completely blind to historical evidence and cite the same evidence and turns of phrase of Holocaust deniers. You've insulted me a number of times which makes you quite the hypocrite and I'm the one who has actually focused on the subject matter. You've just been talking about imaginary rules of etiquette for this sort of conversation and avoiding the topic for several posts.

I'm not going to ""fix my tone"" because some hack like you tells me to, sorry buddy. The reason I'm convinced that I can't learn anything from you is because you're wrong and nobody with any credibility with regards to the field of history agrees with you. When you're done complaining, avoiding the subject (I'm the one staying on topic), avoiding criticism and avoiding making any sort of argument, and disregarding etiquette yourself, then I'll have a more civilised conversation with you. Until then you're literally just another nutter on the internet.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","So the only counter is ""no, the guy who created the series is wrong because he didn't give us numbers we like""?  He has no superior lifting feats as a kid.  It's a clear advancement in strength, just not to the ridiculous extent the fans believe in.

Not to mention, Toriyama continues to support the fact that base Goku didn't advance nearly as much as people thought.  Remember how Bills said that even EoS Goku wasn't strong enough to beat Frieza without going SSJ?  People just got fooled by filler stuff with Goku/Gohan beating the likes of Frieza and Cell in base.","1420070905"

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","Couple of choices here. In most states (assuming you are in the US), it's abuse to hit you and leave a mark. If you are bleeding/bruised, call DSS. Alternatively, call the police and say ""my parents just beat me and I'm scared"". They will remove you from the home and place you with either a family member or foster care. 
If you decide not to do this, you need to become the best actor ever. I'm talking academy award winning material. You have to act like the straightest kid ever. Why? Why would you pretend to be someone you aren't? Because your life depends on it. It's not safe where you are. You CAN'T be yourself there. Deep down you know who you are. And you and I both know your sexuality isn't going to change. You are perfect just how you are right now. So play their stupid little game now simply for survival. Never trust them with who you are. Make it until you are out of the house. And then become the wonderful real person you are. Just make sure you make it out alive. It's about survival right now. You CAN do this. And you are worth it!","1420070907"

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","I just wish the game didn't lie about how much stamina it used. You are supposed to be able to charge for 20 seconds, since your base stamina is 100 and the skill takes ""5""

But in reality it takes 10 per second. Helps to get the +50 stamina amulet  so you can charge for 15 seconds, and the ability that makes you regen stamina 50% faster when under 50%

With those two things, the instant your charge gets off cooldown, you have exactly 50% stamina again and can charge for 7.5 seconds","1420070907"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","The Papacy did not compile the Bible. The scriptures exist regardless of the papacy. God worked through His people to assemble the Bible and at one time His people were in the hands of the church, something the Bible mentions specifically with a time prophecy.

They preach not righteous or biblical doctrine. They claim authority over God. They change His scripture, His times, His laws... The pope sits on God's throne showing himself that he is God, claiming to be able to forgive sins which only God can do. They trample all over the principles of the Bible with bureaucracy, something the Jews were clearly rebuked for! The list goes on.

Ravenous wolves in sheep's clothing is exactly what we see. The fact that the Bible rebukes the very people who claim righteousness only makes sense. They are Jews outwardly, but not inwardly... circumcised of the flesh but not of the heart.

Don't take my word for it. Ask Him for guidance and study for yourself. God has blessed us with this revelation, and [the reformers saw this](http://amazingdiscoveries.org/S-deception_end-time_Antichrist_Daniel_John-Knox) a long time ago. Influence within the church has turned people against God's light.","1420070907"

On that note, for our larger 110ch stores I usually approve bids of 125k.  They include both indoors and outdoors.  Some smaller jobs I have seen were 50ch for 50k.  

When I install I always throw out small bids to ensure I get it.  I would do a 32ch for probably 15k-20k depending on challenges.  If it was a company with a low budget, friends, or possibly re-hire me, I would do it for a little less.  ","1420070913"

We usually have one or two snowfalls throughout the year, and the rest is all rain. The better weather mean many of us out here are pretty outdoor-sy. It is really a beautiful place, with mountains just minutes from downtown. Hiking, biking, skiing and snowboarding are all pretty popular. 

Hockey is as big as it is made out to be too. Last year during the Olympics my entire school gathered in the Cafeteria to watch the Women's gold medal game. 

Secondary education is still expensive, but no where near the cost of what it is in the US. It costs about $30,000 to get through university. The universities are all pretty good, too.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i"," [These](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjEFxguk5ko) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsS9BuP2wSA) show what Joseph Smith likely came across. While I don't explicitly doubt that he found some sort of tablets, they certainly weren't made of gold. Also, the where. I don't think that hillside, although the location in Western New York he alleged is so far fetched. More likely stolen from a Masonic Temple, though. 

*enter conspiracy time* 

When JS found out about the plates during a meeting at the temple, as he and his kin were members, he made it his goal to free them. They are the story of the bible on the North American continent from 12,000 years ago.(I suspect, since I figure that's how old the actual bible story is, and it was just chopped down and mangled over time. It being representative of ideals of another earlier time, from another time before...). When he found them they had script similar to Elder Futhark and Aramaic and [Ge'ez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez_language).

 Since it had similarities to EF, which is the newest of the three, you can figure a clever lad with a ""seer stone"" could figure it out. Since he was in New York, and since there is little elaboration on his actual acquisition of his stone, I'll figure it was a circular template with either Ge'ez or Aramaic written language from some exhibition nearby. 

Now, I mentioned Aramaic, and it's probably a language you know of. I doubt you know what Ge'ez(pronounced how it looks) is. It is the language of the Eritrean people. Among them number [Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church)(I can't help but wonder if that doesn't reference [Tiw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BDr) from another culture. Or [Tiwanaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwanaku), all ancient. What if we weren't separated by time like we think. Advanced as the Romans in the jungles of South America, the Aztecs stomped through the underbrush until they were destroyed by disease.

 Super-bug strains of the flu, Typhus could easily decimate a population if they weren't expecting it. I imagine it happens every once in a while, die-offs. Then whomever is left resumes caveman like. Well, forest and such dweller. The CDC just said that the [flu levels](http://www.wunderground.com/maps/health/) are at epidemic numbers, and we have medicine. 

TL;DR: It may be odd sounding, however how do you know better? I grew up LDS and it makes some sense. Do you realize that [Nebiru](so called Planet X, the 10th, maybe 11th) is referenced by the Mormon [Kolob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob)? LDS stories aren't so far fetched when you figure human societies have been around for much longer than the last 20,000 years. ","1420070914"

"redditdota2league","t5_2w8vi","HELLO I am Catemonster. I change my name ingame a lot so if you don't recognize a name it might be me (currently going by Vi). I am a computer science major at UDC and this is my first RD2L season.

I'm a former League player and swapped to Dota in June of this year; I went from 150 hours in the game to over 1200 in 6 months. I like to play carry or mid, sometimes offlane; I support if no one else will. Farming is probably my favorite thing to do in game other than killing people.

My favorite heroes are Drow Ranger, Windrunner, QoP, OD, PA, Lina, Bounty, and Luna. 

I think I'm a pretty nice person. I generally like to joke around a lot in game, but when a match is SRS BSNS I will focus quite hard. I vacillate between wanting to help my team and wanting to just farm all day. 

Never give up. Never surrender.

"DestructiveReaders","t5_2z15u","&gt;I'm going to speculate wildly and say that under 20% of RDR posters have read 20 pieces of literary fiction in their lives, and under 1% of r/writing posters even know what literary fiction is. But everyone reads genre fiction, so it's much easier to get worthwhile feedback, even if it's just a personal opinion.


It's interesting that you brought this up, because I noticed that there's a substantial amount of animosity towards literary fiction / MFA writers here (even more-so in /r/writing), and that people conflate MFA work with ""cookie-cutter narratives"" and ""purple prose"", when in fact –and just look at recent graduates from the Iowa Writer's Workshop– many of the best (and most original) writers today have gone through the MFA system. 

It's upsetting to see the general ignorance in this sub (and of course, the internet as a whole —this is already a very well-maintained garden), especially when novice-level attempts at literary fiction are met with half-serious ""oh you must be in an MFA program"" comments. And then! To think that these same commenters have only published KDP Singles, if at all —and have yet to attract an agent, or complete a book / movie deal with a publishing house, or have their work looked at by a professional editor, or win a single grant, honor, or award for their writing (NONE of which requires that you 1) possess an MFA, and/or 2) write literary fiction). It's enough to give the literary fiction writers on this sub a persecution complex. 

This is primarily why I was speculating about the possibility of a smaller, more focused sub. There has to be at least ~20 of us out of the 4000 here right?

She introduced me to my first group of friends as well as becoming my first best friend in high school. I had a crush on her as well but due to my insecurities and fears it prevented me from expressing my emotions and desires to be more than friends. I was alright with it for a long time and we eventually just stayed as good friends for a while. 6 years later and after me undergoing my process recovery I come to find out that she isn't the person that I had previously put in my head that was.(reason I put this in here is because while in recovery,I have been able to find more about myself and why I chose to have this girl in my life) little by little my interest for keeping the friendship starts to diminish as I know that my desired to be more than friends would not be met as well as that the more that I have matured in certain characteristics of my life she had still a little ways to go which In reality I could care less because its her life but when she is constantly complaining and bitching about everything and I try to guide her or help her find the answers to her problem she just chooses to ignore them and keep falling into the same cycle over again. Then in one camping trip with her and my other best friend she decides to be a complete cunt to me due to an argument I had with my other friend and just completely disregards everything I say and acts as if I didnt exist. What hurt is when I went to go lie down next to her at night without any sexual intentions behind it I just wanted to say hi and how are you enjoying the trip and then she goes on to tell to go away the second I lie down next to her. To top it off she tries to hide my cigarettes on the ride back saying that's disgusting to smoke even though she ducking smoked the whole weekend you bitch. God and I even let her know that they need to help clean my moms van when we get back after trashing it and the second we get back they drive away leaving me to clean that shit up. I don't take shit from people that aren't going to be there for me or help me improve as a person or make my presence on this planet more pleasurable so I haven't talked to her since. ","1420070918"

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","As a gamer and someone who has been calling out SJW crap before it went under that banner, it's pretty accurate. It's clearly a broader trend, and an extension of internet culture that's been brewing for years. Some of us use the internet differently from others, but SJWs in particular want to dictate how others use *their* portions. 

And a big part of that is we had a society online where status was practically non-existent. Where it did exist was via merit. You could earn trust by acting responsibly. You didn't need to have your real name attached to a website to want it to run well. The sites that cared for users the most succeeded.

The more people got used to attaching their real identity online, the more they felt under fire. The internet can be a hostile place. Instead of embracing it, or building a wall and enclosing themselves, they chose to try and change everyone else's behavior. They're basically wading into battle and then crying about being shot at, all the while they're firing back.

There's always been crybabies online. The difference is, we used to tell them to join the subculture or find a group they got along with better. And it worked. Now it's ""you can't say that, you can't do that, you can't tell me I'm not in your club, and once I'm in by self-declaration I expect you to meet my needs"". It's much more self-centered than an internet dominated by lack of identity.

It's perhaps something of an inevitability. You always have the frontier and the cityfolk. The people of the frontier explore, and it's rough, but they have the best time of it they can. Eventually, where riches are struck, the cityfolk move in and carpetbag the place. They ""civilize"" it. What we're seeing now is an attempt by normalfags to ""civilize"" and tame the internet so they can have it. Except they're missing what made the internet so great in the first place. 

It's the equivalent of looking at a house, and saying, ""How new and awesome! I want to buy it and live there! But, I miss the old place. Can we move all the furniture in and redecorate a little?"". They like the idea of something being *theirs* more than appreciating it for what it is.","1420070919"

That is my exact point. I want realism. Not some tired idea to grab some quick cash. My understanding was that in Legacy the zombies were always intended as place-holders. I know I have been banging this drum quick a bit on this thread, but ex-military tech such as drones or robots would be more in fitting with Rust's ambiguous nuclear 'event', and mutants would fit the need for a more challenging humanoid enemy, provided they had sufficiently good A.I. and depth. Have them spawn in at loot points, such as rad towns and other abandoned buildings and caves. You want a new gun? Whelp, you need those blueprints. Try raiding that abandoned munitions factory. Oh, shit. There is a whole clan of cannibals in there. Have roving bands of mutants spawning in the forests at night with the occasional stick snap or soft noise the only indication you are being followed. Give them simple tools; spears, clubs, heavy chopping swords and rocks. Someone to fear at night and in numbers, but on a level that a Newman can handle them at day.

Because of the marijuana laws in most states in the US a few plants is equivalent to a meth lab, a moonshine gin, etc as far as what a cop can report on. If he sees it, he can report it. That's why people don't grow their weed in a pot by the window - if the cop sees it in the course of performing his civil duty, he is obliged to report it.

If you've got a ~10m long attic, then I suggest you put a simple 10/20m dipole up there. Optionally you can add more bands later, for example by zig-zagging a 40m dipole as described on page 40-41 [here](http://www.rsgbshop.org/acatalog/PDF/StealthAntennas_Sample.pdf). That's what I've done, and it has worked reasonably well. Being hidden away in the attic, it's completely stealthy.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

"China","t5_2qh2v","It's nice, when you're young and naive and have no standards or self respect. 

Expat communities in China are relatively small, no one wants to be known as the bf of the town bike. These girls get passed around expat circles like cigarettes in prison. They usually exude crazy. By age 26 or so they are off the market for most Chinese men. They are seen as too wild, too tainted by Western influence, maybe some other weird shit like their vaginas will be too loose after too many foreign bfs.

 The end result is that the white guy becomes their last chance, hail Mary to get married. Ask any expats in China and they will usually have a story about shagging some slut he met in a club and having her assume this meant a lifetime commitment. Camping outside your apartment, suicide threats and mentally unstable women showing up at your work to cause trouble for you are only a few of the nicethings you have to look forward to.

The ""free"", all-you-can-fuck buffet that you are imagining also comes with STDs, mental problems and a propensity to fake pregnancies and fuck all your friends. Yes, how ""lucky"" it is to have a host of women willing to fuck you based solely on your race and the stereotyped perceptions of how it will benefit them.

You're better off with a prostitute in most cases, at least they leave afterwards.","1420070931"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","The average potency of the PLD basic combo is 203.33. Fracture is 220.

So if you use it, you -do- gain 16.66 potency, which isn't much (especially with PLD weapon damage / str / Oath) but isn't nothing. And while my points below are limiting, they are true a non-trivial amount of the time. i.e. the MT can safely keep Fracture up during phases 1-2 of Twintania, and it's great to use after tank swapping into OT mode if your TP isn't a concern.

The competition for that cross-class slot isn't Stoneskin, it's Protect and Cure. 

Protect can be used to re-buff a resurrected member, provided 1-1A from my other reply aren't issues and there's no chance you will overwrite a Proshell - i.e. either you have no WHM or the member in question is separated from others or there simply isn't relevant magic damage to worry about.

Cure is just-worse than Stoneskin in nearly all use cases, but in certain desperate situations the one less second of cast time or cheaper MP cost can theoretically mean something.

If those sounds even more narrow than the uses for Fracture, that's because they are. PLD cross-class is pretty locked into Stoneskin - Foresight - Bloodbath - Mercy Stroke - Fracture.","1420070932"

I *am* apprenticed to an attorney who specializes in tax law, and there's nothing shady about the advice given in that document.  It seems to be about eight years old, and laws may have changed since then, but other than that there's no legal issue there.

Here's what you need to understand: tax law is funky.  It has its own highly specific vocabulary, and its rules tend to be just as specific.

Mission Presidents *are not paid* in the eyes of the IRS.  They are reimbursed for volunteer activities for a tax-exempt organization for which they work (more than) full time.  They don't get a salary.  They have to pay off their own credit cards, the mortgage and property taxes on any home they own, etcetera.

The reimbursements do seem generous.  That's not a tax issue.

If you tell the IRS that you get paid, then they'll want to charge you taxes on your salary.  Here's the thing: if a mission president told the IRS that they were paid for their service, they would be *lying.*  It comes back again to that very specific vocabulary.  By the IRS definition, Mission Presidents are not paid, and are not required to report their living expense reimbursements.

If it sounds confusing, that's because it is!  Tax law in the US is a mess.  That's why we have lawyers and accountants who literally do nothing else but help people navigate it without breaking the law or going broke.

But please, tell me more about all the people assassinated by the Danites (zero) or executed under the doctrine of blood atonement (also zero) or whine about a marriage that Helen Kimball defended until the end of her life, long after she could have been under any coercion to do so.","1420070933"

I lost every single one of my JW friends. All of them. Which really sucked b/c, yep, I grew up JW. I had to virtually write off all of my childhood friends AND their families (being a JW is living in a small town regardless of where you are) so yeah, it was a lonely time. 

Fast forward nine years later: I have fewer friends than I once did because I'm really choosy and because I value the kind of deep, trusting friendships I felt I had as a JW back when.

"NYCFC","t5_2x3v3","I understand the response but people have to realize that the Premier league always will be the main priority. City have made it through the group stages of the Champions league and are battling to retain the premier league title, and they need reinforcements. This is much more important missing some games at the beginning of a season. The CFG ownership made what is overall the best decision and it makes sense. Frank is doing well so simply extend his loan rather then signing another world class midfielder with money that could be used to buy a striker, seeing as we are restricted due to FFP. 
NYCFC fans have the right to be upset seeing as they probably don't support Manchester city anyways but if you think about it, you will probably be dominating MLS in a few seasons and you already have a world class striker. Why support a team over one player anyways? Its the city of New York that NYCFC represents and NYCFC is part of CFG and frankly that partnership is going to benefit in the long run. 
I am also pretty sure that City will send some EDS players as well as another designated player in the mean time so its not like everything is  completely a-wall because frank extended his loan. That being said I can understand why nycfc fans feel shafted but I dont understand why you would completely turn your back on the team that represents your city.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","If it's a good story, yup, I'll read it if it doesn't have male characters. I don't care much at all about gender. If the story is engrossing and told well I don't care about the gender of the characters. I'm male. 

I think a lot of this gender stuff is being blown a bit out of proportion. In my opinion authors are artists. I look at books primarily as the author writing something that is enjoyable to them and we're lucky as consumers to be able to buy those stories and read them. 

The choices made by the author were what they felt was best for their story. It's not my job to tell them they did it wrong. I can only say whether I enjoyed the story or not, not that the author was wrong for what they wrote. With fiction at least, and generally always with fantasy the world and characters are not meant to be factual. This means there is little room for the author to be wrong. 

It's like me coming to your job and telling you that you're doing it wrong, but you've been doing the job for 30 years and I've never done it once in my life. 

As consumers though we have the ability to speak with our wallets. If you don't like a story from an author you have every right to not buy more from that author. You can also recommend books that do fit your particular interests. I don't think you have the right to tell an author they're wrong because they wrote something you didn't agree with. Taste, interests and priorities are different for everyone and proclaiming that a book is bad because it doesn't contain ""x"" is just silly. 

Look at Brianna Wu, the game developer who has been harassed by GamerGater's because she's a woman in gaming. She found games weren't catering to her interests so she is creating her own. 

If you find books aren't catering to your interests write your own! If you are finding something is missing from the books you read then you have found a possible niche that you could be highly successful in. Odds are if you're super interested in that type of ""thing"" then there's the possibility others will feel the same way.

With this said, it's fine to feel like women aren't represented properly. But  it's not ""wrong"" to not have female characters in a book. It's simply that an entire category of books could use some love from people who can write about it in an enjoyable way for those of us who want that to read.","1420070945"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","And had it been an Iranian map maker, then sure. But if a, say, German map maker was to remove Taiwan from the map this would be a story as well.

**Edit**

Also note that China really doesn't want Taiwan to be a country, Argentina really doesn't recognize any British rights to the Falklands. 

But the ""story"" going on about Israel is that the Arabs aren't against the existence of Israel, just the occupation and the treatment of the Palestinians.

But they didn't create a ""smaller bordered"" Israel, they removed Israel completely and replaced it with Palestine.

This is proof that the mere existence of Israel is offensive to the Arab world, like Israel keeps claiming and unlike what many ""Israel critics"" would want you to believe. In other words, this insinuates that the problem isn't the occupation but rather the very existence of Israel that drives the conflict.","1420070945"

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","Things are certainly not as bad, from an inequality point of view, as in the US and some other countries. I mostly support as near perfect equality of opportunity as we can achieve without guaranteeing equality of outcome (though with a solid floor).

There are lots of barriers to exiting poverty, including lack of affordable housing and child care in urban areas, for example, and we should certainly focus on those.

I don't have a solution at hand to income inequality. Piketty proposes a wealth tax, which would have all sorts of unintended consequences, I suspect. Other sorts of tax on the wealthy (e.g. income surtaxes) generate very little revenue and thus are not of that much benefit. The best I can come up with is modest increases in consumption and income taxes generally, with very healthy tax credits / benefits at the lower end, combined with other policies that promote economic growth, such as infrastructure and R&amp;D investments.","1420070946"

3. Lots of discussion between noble people of the Land and Round Table about an incoming Goblin invasion
4. Princess convinces adventurers to defend everyone against Goblin invasion. With Crusty as general, they beat them up.
5. Southern city tries to take over the city by creating chaos while a festival and decrease reliability of the people to the round table, but Shiroe fiures it out and stops them.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","How would this be fair at all? A restraining order? Surely you can't find this a logical progression. Just because a man has no rights over the child does not mean he should be forced to change work places or schools and get something that can severely harm chances of being hired elsewhere. The family of the man does not have any claim to the child anyways, so that is a moot point (since it is a given).

Next, why would the man need to forfeit such a huge amount? If this were enacted the ""fair"" system would require the woman to pay the man damages for not having a child he wanted. It's illogical in concept, not to mention there is no reason for child support to be increased.

Also, some women don't even find out until 8 weeks or more into a pregnancy. This would mean that the man wouldn't have a choice.

As for the reasoning you posted, humiliation easily falls under the category of cruel and unusual punishment which is banned by the 8th amendment in the USA, and is banned in most other developed countries as well. 

Basically what I am saying is that your suggestion is not only illogical, but the reasoning behind it is deemed invalid by the U.S. Constitution.","1420070947"

Also, I keep all my jar shadows in a box too. I just make sure they're all upright and tightly closed. It's just the most convenient way for me since I haven't found another method! I tend to depot all my sample baggies, just because I prefer using jars though.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; Mathematics is a science of shapes...

that's a geometry, a specific branch of mathematics.

&gt; logic

logic is generally bigger than mathematics, though you can kind of think of mathematics as formalized, symbolic logic if you'd like.

&gt; measurements

that's engineering.

&gt;  Okay then : We derived mathematics, the first one based on how we thought. You had 1 stone and you added another. You have 2 stones. And this thought developed into what we called mathematics.

sure, at some point we employed certain things as axiomatic because they appeared practical. we probably did this prior to its logical proof in *principia mathematica*. now it's no longer an axiom; it's a theorem. a theorem with a 160-ish page logical proof.

&gt;  Axiom is some statement that is taken for granted without the need of proof. Because the whole field is based upon that statement. Meaning you can't prove axiom. I did not meant 1+1 specifically.

yes, mathematics certain *has* axioms (1+1=2 is not among them). as i pointed out in my initial reply, mathematicians enjoy playing with *different* axioms sometimes, almost recreationally. for instance, i went to a rather fun lecture by john conway once that supposed, axiomatically, a different law of addition.

&gt; My reply was meant to be more exotic. Can we derive a valid logical system, where we couldn't express values from our standard systems ?

sure. imaginary numbers, for instance.","1420070952"

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

- Intel offers better single core performance which is more important than more cores in games

- this is the cheapest 8GB ram you can get right now.

- Greens are really slow, and this is cheaper

- Better GPU

- Better MATX case, you dont really need ATX for a single GPU

- slightly more efficient PSU isnt worth more than 2x the price

- Most people dont ever use optical drives, unless you buy physical games or CDs there isnt a reason to get one.","1420070960"

Most overseas Chinese girls have been brought up as only childs in their family and are quite rude. I've had my fair amount of bad experiences dating them. It's a culmination of society and parental doting, where an entire family system only has them for the future. Not to mention that most of them have to extremely well off to even come to this beautiful land, so they are quite disjointed from reality.

I work in retail part time and I know many many rich Chinese girls. They tell me that they go on Tinder etc and stuff to find white boys exclusively as it's more cool, even if they have Asian bfs. Generally, you will have a chance with them if you're rich or good looking but I suggest you go to Asia if you really like Asians. In Australia, you're not exactly marketable. Racism against Asians is alright still in most parts of the world.

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","So I have been where you are. 

When I was 17 I left my parents place. We disagreed on a bunch of things and I left. I moved in with my partner and I ended up leaving school. I worked for a few years, then we moved interstate so we could afford to move her little brothers in with us. Their home life was dangerous and they were floundering, so when we took them in it was mainly so they would survive, not so they would thrive. 

We had then for about 5 years, they are back in the other state with their mom. But they are starting to thrive. One is in school again, pursuing the kind of creative stuff he excels at, and the other is calmer, learning to back down and be comfortable with himself, something we never thought would happen. 

Now that all the panic and rage is over I am planning my return to study. I never finished school, so it is a little complex getting into college, but I am doing it. My wife is now getting treatment for her bipolar and is pushing herself hard into that. She is doing really well. 

I am now on the other side of the hard stuff and everything from here will be easier because those other issues are out of the way. It took evaluating what was important to decide to take the boys in but it was the most rewarding this I have ever done. You need to do your own evaluation and figure out what you want. Once you have that you are unstoppable. ","1420070964"

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","Generally speaking, if you can buy at rental parity and own it for a while, you really should. The buildings you're looking at have high rental value, as you pointed out, and cost about as much to own as they do to rent. That's without factoring in principal reduction, tax benefits and (hopefully) appreciation that outstrips inflation. It also doesn't factor in the time value of your down payment. Rather than factor all that yourself, just use this: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?_r=0

Still the best calculator I've seen. You just need to make sure prices go up, on average, during the time you own it. And they probably will. Inventory in River North remains somewhat depressed, which means prices will continue to rise. I'm thinking 4-5% in 2015. 

Full disclosure, I own a real estate brokerage so *of course* I think it's a good time to buy :-p. But we also do rentals, so I like to think I'm fairly objective. 

If you do rent the place out after you buy it, just make sure you time your lease to start between May 1 and August 1. ","1420070965"

"confession","t5_2qo2a","I saw this on the front page. It immediately caught my attention because of the condition of my teeth. I have teeth broken off below my gum line, cavities in my front teeth, and a broken front tooth that I know is going to fall out any day now. Like so many people here I can't afford to get them fixed. I find myself DISGUSTING. I have totally isolated myself. I don't go out with friends or family anymore. I will only talk to someone face to face if I cover my mouth, I don't even talk to my husband much anymore. I have constant infections and already have a heart problem that I am sure is being exacerbated by my dental problem. If it is below 40 degrees, breathing in that air is like shards of glass shoved into my gums. I eat very little now because chewing is such a pain. I guess that is life. I have a fund going that I contribute to whenever I can to get myself to the dentist at some point.

The real reason I joined this subreddit is to say I thought I was alone. Finding out I am not the only one in this boat disgusts me more than I disgust myself. No one should have to live like this, to see that so many are horrifies me. Why can't the government offer some type of low cost or subsidized dental care? They are so hot and bothered about everyone having health care ... why not dental care also? Let's face it folks, if your teeth suck, your overall health sucks and no amount of health insurance is going to change that if you don't have dental insurance. I AM REALLY FUCKING PISSED OFF THAT SO MANY OF US ARE IN THIS BOAT!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sorry, I'm so angry I'm crying ... ever get that mad?

But Tomato_Juice99 I am so, so very happy that you see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not going to lie, I'm jealous, but more so I am thrilled for you. Enjoy every minute of your new life. I can't wait for mine to start.","1420070966"

His attempt at turning Obi-Wan to his side may have been a deception, but it could have been true as well. Perhaps he was simply seeking revenge for the death of his apprentice, Qui-Gon, or for the greater ""death"" of the Order and the Republic itself.

In 1956 the USS Eaton (DD-510), a Fletcher-Class destroyer, was struck by the USS Wisconsin, Iowa-Class battleship, in dense fog at night. The Wisconsin's bow struck the starboard side of the Eaton just forward of the bridge and just about sliced the ship's bow off. I know it's not the best, but I'll quote Wikipedia here: ""The ship's [Eaton] 1st LT saved the ship by securing bow to stern with anchor chain, and closing WT [watertight] door beside his room.""  
[Here's a photo of the damage to the Eaton](http://imgur.com/jr5ZoZc). Apparently the gash extended 6 feet below the waterline. 
[Here's a photo of the damage to the Wisconsin.](http://i.imgur.com/J0eUz16.jpg) And [here's](http://i.imgur.com/FLcxMtS.jpg) a closer view.
The bow was taken from the unfinished USS Kentucky and put onto the Wisconsin. [Here's a picture of that happening if you're interested.](http://i.imgur.com/CFSFZ4R.jpg) Apparently the operation took 16 days.  
I remember hearing that the Wisconsin is a few feet longer than it was when it was launched because of the bow grafting operation, but I can't find anything to back that up. Still, it's a cool ship and available for tours at Nauticus in Norfolk, VA.","1420070969"

Basically a rare commodity is something that can be bought (in limited quantity) in exactly one station per rare commodity (example: Lavian Brandy at Lave Station in Lave). It can be sold at any other station in the galaxy and increases in value the further away from the station you bought it from.

There's a nice overview of 

Your other question:

&gt; is this what people mean by trade routes? They just buy rares and then long haul it to sell them?

It can be, but that's not the only kind of trade route there is. A route for rare trading would typically mean finding multiple stations that sell rares that are relatively close together, loading up with rares from those and then fly ~160ly away to sell it all (if possible to another area of stations that offer rare goods so you can buy new ones and fly back to where you came from).

Trade routes can also just be any routes where you make a profit by hauling regular goods though.","1420070971"

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","BS in Mech E and MBA from an ivy league here. 

First imagine what your looking to do. I'd say an MBA is good for changing your career into consulting or banking which will certainly increase your future worth (think 120k-150k salary first year out with high jumps a couple years in) but at the cost of much higher hours. However if you're looking to progress in your current industry, the payoff becomes less clear. However I can say that for larger companies above a certain level almost everyone has an MBA.

I'd say there would be two viable paths I'd consider: 2 year full time MBA and a part time program. If you do a 2 year program make sure you are getting into a top 20 or you will be wasting time and money (you are paying for the network as much as the education and label). A part time program would be less important to look at ranking and perhaps cheaper and could be a good option if you are looking to continue in your current career track.","1420070971"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","&gt; Is building a laptop just not a thing 

Not really, most people who game want a desktop since laptops are just awful for playing games on. That and there are very few bare bone laptop chassis than an end user can purchase. 

To game on a laptop you will need to spend at least $1200 to get about 1/2 the performance of a $600 PC. Gaming laptops are also very heavy, use a ton of power (don't try to use it unplugged...), generate a ton of heat and are much more likely to break. 

If he really wants to play on max settings a desktop is going to be a must unless he has a $3000 budget for a top-of-the-line laptop.

*edit* 

Also gaming laptops are non-upgradeable, you spend $1200 on something that will be too slow inside 2 years anyway. If he wants to game get a good desktop and a weaker laptop for portable needs. Gaming laptops just are not worth the money you pay for them.","1420070975"

In reply to [/u/Maalkav](/u/Maalkav) on [""Juan Francisco Casas. All of these were created using only a ball point pen.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/2qw1d6):

&gt; I'm wondering that too. The drawings are amazing but the subjects are all very mundane. It's strange. He's apparently 38 years old too. You would think at this age there's better things to draw than half-naked drunk girls. But yeah, I guess that's art for you. To each his own.

"Indiemakeupandmore","t5_2w8pb","I'm still really new to indies, so I haven't tried a huge variety yet, but:

Eyes: Tie between Shiro's Ghost of Colors Past or HW Garden from the November Visage Box! I like Ghost for those single-color wash and go! kind of days and I use Garden as a way to add extra sparkle to pretty much every look.

Lips: I love my lip lustres, but my favorite lip product this year is AFK's Tiny Evil Santa. I like the ease of using it, the lovely brown-tinged red, and the adorably nefarious artwork!

Perfume: Solstice Scents Snowshoe Pass is the closest I've ever come to loving a perfume enough to make it my ""signature scent.""

Lotion: Sixteen 92 Toasted Marshmallow lotion is warm and delicious, and I keep finding my little boy sniffing my hands when I wear it. :P

Product of the Year: My absolute favorite thing, though, has to be Peppermint Bark lotion from Sixteen92. In the jar it's a nice enough Peppermint and Vanilla lotion. On my skin, though, (and /u/vanityclaire, I have no idea how you work this magic) it warms and mellows into this minty vanilla amazingness that smells just like I remember my mom smelling when she hugged me after school every day. I can't wear the darn stuff out of the house because I keep tearing up when I smell it, but the memories it brings are a wonderful thing.","1420070976"

"birding","t5_2qliv","I've been doing this for (what I think of as) a long time and there are still local similar species that I really struggle to tell apart. It's still good if you can say ""well that looks like a pipit, maybe a meadow or tree pipit but I can't remember which is which"". It's still good if you can say ""I know that's a tern not a gull because of the sharply-pointed wings and the slim bill"". IDing the species is great and it's roughly what you're working towards but each rung on the ladder it an achievement in itself.

Also, I recommend using an online birding quiz. I've been using [this one](http://www.birdphotos.com/photos/index.php?q=gallery&amp;g2_itemId=5926&amp;g2_quiz=start0) recently. Check the multiple choice option to start out and do the quiz by country option. It's not the most aesthetically-pleasing layout and if you check 'Allow User Album photos' there may be the very occasional misidentified bird or an image with lots of different species but it should help.

Just doing the quiz for the whole world (don't select a country and leave all the regions checked) might help you learn what features make good field marks and what makes a species fall into a certain group, though you won't have heard of most of the species that come up. What's good is that a lot of the time they have names like ""red-fronted amazon"" and you might notice that all amazons are quite robust and compact-looking greenish parrots, for example, and that the colour of the forehead is a good field mark in amazons.","1420070978"

I like to hear why people like there watches, the stories behind them.  There is more to a watch than just how much it cost.  If there is a super rare $900 dollar watch that has a story behind it or it just can't be found anymore.  Hell if someone has a memory of a 5 dollar timex there dad used to wear and they couldnt' find it anywhere anymore and searching for it is there 'white whale' more power to them.  And lets remember, you are the one who got offended.

I'm 24 and went to parties since I was like 16, so 8 years of REALLY sucky parties and NYE already.

It sucks bro but I hang to it. Why? Cus I know it will happen eventually, and if not, I don't fucking care, there's a lot of other shit to experience in life than sex. If I die, I'd want to have done the fullest. At the moment I coulnd't care less if I get a girl on 2015 or not, I just wanna game the newst games, begin and finish my studies in a foreign country, see how the technology will develop in the next 20 years...

I know this must be one of the suckiest nights to be out and seemingly alone, but you will get better nights dude, just keep going. Dont limit your realm of possibilities to your current age, aim for the maximum threshold until you die so you get the chance to experience all that variables.

"DebateFascism","t5_2v642","Generally what people say when they talk about progressivism in politics. Greater acceptance, more working together as a society, etc. Any thoughts that people consider new and morally correct. I'm not arguing against that, I'm just saying people will use it as justification to get angry at people who don't have the same political opinions as them. 

The more I think of this the more I realize I don't really believe in any absolute politics. Everything is situational and at a personal level. I disagree with a vast majority of people, but I'm not certain I'd say I hate them, just I dislike hatred and conflict and feel the only way to move past that is at a personal level. If people can do that, well that's good for them. Change past anywhere at our current level of incredibly basic tribal politics on any significant scale is, well kinda silly and unrealistic. Before I saw fascism as a way to harness this and make everyone relatively happy and alive, but now, ehhh. I'm becoming less of a dreamer and more thinking about moving into the woods with an echo box of like minded people to an extent where conflict would be resolved by agreement to the right of self, but even then I don't feel much morally better. Maybe the only way to be 'right' is to live as a hermit and be free of any poison that comes as a byproduct to human interaction. But that also seems radical and silly. Or maybe no one is right, and anything will work if people get defensive and tribal enough. And I think I just went full circle to why I'm a fascist. ","1420070983"

In the RoboRIO, all outputs are disabled at 7V, to prevent the RoboRIO's voltage from dipping too low. One above 7V, the outputs are re-enabled. 7V is not an uncommon voltage to see in an FRC match, especially late in the day.

This is an was change because it simply requires deleting a single word. Where as inclusivity for lifestyles that do not align with those presented in the hypothetical novel would arguably alter the content the author was intending to portray. This could be seen as changing the underlying meaning of the novel which I see as as big of an issue as a heteronormative society. I am adamantly against censure for any reason especially when reframing the context of a novel so that a child or student understands it isnt representative of modern society is a cleaner solution.

do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part.
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart.
Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I'll never know.
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down.

Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I'd actually like to see the movies do this and have Miles take over. Then maybe we can get a Spider-Men movie when he and an older Spider-Men from an alternate universe meet and team up. Then maybe we can see a Spider-Man who isn't a teenager.","1420070997"
"VoiceActing","t5_2r878","On your documentary demo:

I like your phrasing, but it sounds like you are pushing the dialect a little. Your second clip (this desolate world is ruled by dinosaurs) sounded a little forced. Were you channeling Jeremy Clarkson? 

Your third track (about Cousteau) sounded like you were slipping out of character as the narrator in spots. You sounded rushed and in one passage, (""...Others are engineers, marine biologists, archaeologists or navigators"") it sounded like you're saying it with a slight sigh to your voice, which gives the impression of you being very ""matter-of-fact"" with the copy. 

Overall I can see you were going for three different styles of tone, and they came through good. Your range sounds good, though I think clip may be a little too long for a narration VO demo. You might be able to tighten it up a little and give it a sense of urgency. 

Really good job! 

On your commercial demo:
Some good stuff there, but its way too long. As a casting director, I've made my mind up within the first 5 seconds, so you have to really knock me over in a very short amount of time. 

You need to cut down the different spots to basically just one line each. You are trying to show the range to your voice in as short amount of space as possible. 


Overall I'd say this was a very well done demo. Good production (though dont let the music take over the spot) and good variety. I think if you just shortened it and tightened up the speed of everything, it would be a great demo.


Great job!

You are just on the edge of passing so you may want to go back and reevaluate your heat treat process just to be sure if something drifts a bit one way or the other you can maintain conformance.  

I can't speak for every metallurgist out there, but I typically think of hardness as a quick check to verify a material is in a condition that I want.  In your case we want to verify that the material has been heat treated in such a way that it will resist wear.  Other hardness checks will be to verify the heat treat condition to estimate strength of material, or suitability for machining.  I would expect whomever put the limits on the print would have used a coverage factor in their hardness numbers so that being on the bottom or top of the limits would +/- a HRC point or two would still work in the application, but I can't tell you that for sure.

"rupaulsdragrace","t5_2t3or","&gt;To me, it seems like the truly successful ones (read: successful after the show) are those that learn from their RPDR experience rather than trying to copy it. People like growth, and repetition gets stale real quick.

That need to grow is something I feel like gets hamfisted onto people during the show and it's also something that RuPaul and Michelle talk about a lot on What's The Tee. Unfortunately, (and I think Laganja is a clear example of this) as much as Drag Race can be an opportunity to grow, to give enough fame to further a career, dropping that onto someone who isn't ready for it isn't going to turn out well. 

Though Ru and other people involved with the show are clearly interested in increasing the public standing of drag and improving the careers of people who appear on the show, in the end the show is about offering reality TV show drama. 

I do think though, that the show has reached a level of following (and with the potential expansion to the UK) that some of that could be dispensed with. It certainly seems to me that the highlights of the show have been the caring ones (e.g. Raven and Jujubee breaking down during All Stars) and that the lows have been when the endless dramatic bullshit carries on (like the Heathers, followed by that fake-ass apology from Raja during the season finale).

I am glad that Laganja has been getting her life together. I still have hopes for Beyond Belief becoming a show, and I would much rather see a healthy, sane Laganja, than the unbearable one we got on Drag Race.","1420071002"

50 years since and $20 trillion spent on Great Society programs, and it's still not enough, because poverty isn't something government can ""fix"" with simple wealth transfers. 

Even if we were to accept the ""poverty ==&gt; crime"" thesis (which is nonsense—look at history within the United States or specific ethnic or religious groups), efforts to counter it have made the problem worse.

Welfare and cultural shifts have all but destroyed the black family, where 72% of blacks are born out-of-wedlock and most are raised by one parent. Why chaotic home environments with little guidance and parental support aren't seen as being as much of a contributor to crime as ""poverty"" is dumbfounding. 

It's very often that poor family structure and parenting leads to the very habits which impoverish people: the unwillingness to acquire academic or workplace skills; poor financial management; low impulse control, and so on. 

Most of Detroit and Washington D.C. public school students are functionally illiterate, despite enormous sums of money spent on public education. ","1420071005"

The Mech Tournament
---
Cyberpunk world where PCs are a team of mech pilots in what is basically a mix of Phantom Crash/Steel Lancer Arena International and Zoids New Century. Mech battles are tuned to use nonlethal ordinance and viewed as a sport, players compete their way through tourney. 

The game has a vast underground gambling circuit, which has led to the formation of what is basically mafia families who various competitors work with to purchase better rides or to sabotage rivals. More successful ones can get sponsorship from more ""legit"" companies, advertising toothpaste, shoes, etc.

Idea would be to have a ""pre-match"" time where you'd be preparing and living in the cyberpunk world, and a ""match"" period as a big robot loaded with weapons.

Village Quest 2100
---
The idea is that PCs are jointly in charge of a village as chiefs or whatever. Each of them has a small contingent of followers who will follow them for whatever reason: say, like 50-100 guys. See if they try to expand the village, war with each other, try to move the whole village somewhere else, whatever. 

As far as setting goes...I've bounced back and forth between so many different things. Goblin Tribes, Fantasy Humans, Post Apocalypse Survivors, Native Americans...I've never come up with something I actually liked enough to settle on. 

Resident Evil 4: The Campening
---
I kinda always wondered what would happen if I took RE4 and turned it into a tabletop with little to no adjustments. how fast would it take for the PCs to screw up everything, even if they knew from meta-knowledge basically what the story was?

I have no idea why they had and adopted children, they wanted nothing to do with them and the children's behavior reflected that. Too many caregivers, none permanent, absent patents. Ugh.

One thing I'm trying to experiment with that I haven't done yet, is seeing how assists carry over. 

Let's say you scramble your first wave light mech over the walls and plink all 12 enemy mechs for at least a damage each and die.
Your second wave is your mech with bonuses to CBills. That mech finds a cozy corner and sits AFK for the entire match as your team battles it out. 

Assuming your team kills at least the first wave of mechs, you'll end with 0 damage on your ""bonus"" mech, but 12 assists. Will those assists count for the first mech that died, or will those assists count for your one with bonuses - as it was the one that was alive for when the enemy mechs went down?

I've still got a bit of testing to do, but you can see where the logic goes.  ","1420071007"

&gt;  last weekend. You can see it for yourself. Prices were holding steady in the 2500 range +/- 500 and had been for about 3 weeks, then dropped down to 1000 over a weekend. 

https://theunderminejournal.com/#illidan/item/118472

The 26th was last Friday.  The 19th was the Friday before that.  The spike for the 19th doesn't coincide with any other spikes on other servers.  The only spikes I've found that are on multiple servers are on the 26th, but prices remain steady throughout and it's only on a handful of servers.

So, either there is no dupe, the dupe is rolling out slowly, or the dupe is exclusive to Illidan.  I'm inclined to say there is no dupe because of how many servers have seen steady decline over the past few weeks.","1420071008"

If you're going to eat something that is aggressively cooked (meaning, primarily, not cooked by water or via microwave) then you'd best eat something that counts. Namely organ meats, since they are brimming with nutrition. 

Lean cuts of meat don't really make too much sense to eat. Protein? Ok. But there are better options there. Nutritional content? Not a chance. Lean cuts are comparably scanty when it comes to nutritional density.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","OH NO the plane has broken, it is going down and certain doom is imminent. However you, in your infinite wisdom have checked a parachute in as your carry on. Follow these easy steps to survive.

* Step 1: Fight against ~1,000 pounds per square foot of pressure keeping the door shut.
  
* Step 2: Holy shit you opened it? I honestly didn't expect you to make it this far. Well you then have to figure out how to exit without hitting a part of the plane. I'm sorry for the inconvenience but these things weren't exactly designed for midair exits. Hopefully whatever broke the plane killed the engines.
  
* Step 3: Congrats, you are now plummeting from somewhere close to 30,000 feet (~9,000 meters). Are you wearing HALO jump gear? No? Well you should be passing out in about 30 seconds from the lack of oxygen, hopefully you wake up sometime during the 3 minute freefall to pull your chute. Oh yea the ambient temperature is about -30 Degrees F as well... Have fun with that.
  
* Step 4?: Well apparently you are the Incredible Hulk if you got to this point. Congrats on your amazing feat of badassitude. Oh yea, the plane. It probably landed safely somewhere, those things are over engineered to the point of insanity, the redundant systems have redundancies. 
  
TL:DR: Most of the horrible accidents you hear of are during takeoff and landing. Once the plane gets to a point where you could jump staying in the plane actually has a far better survival chance, especially if you are unfamiliar with skydiving in the first place. ","1420071009"

 The hard lane, aka offlane, is used mostly for heroes that require fast levels and have an important ultimate ability that they want to get. In competitive and high level games you will most likely be solo in the hard lane so you can get the most exp. This means that your 2 supports and carry will be on the other side lane. Likewise, you will be facing the enemy's 2 supports and carry so it will be somewhat hard to get farm and come close to lane if the supports are doing their job. 

At lower level games, there will be a support in each lane instead of putting them both in one lane (known as a dual lanes). You'll be able to get to the creeps easier but you're splitting the exp with the other support.","1420071010"

Things in those parts of cities were not as well maintained or monitored. So maybe not the world but definitely cities in the USA are like this. If you look at the entire continent of Africa its made up of some of the most unstable and/or violent countries in the world. So to make the joke that Cape Town is the south side of this ghetto of a continent makes sense if you know anything about the world. But obviously you missed a few things during your development as the world changed around you. Go watch tv and eat some mcdonalds while you grow out your neck beard and search for fedoras in your size on amazon, and while your at it you should probably move out of your parents basement.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I will share my story since I can contribute. I had a septo-rhinoplasti twice. The first time went great. Woke up from surgery didn't know where I was, had a friend drive me home and had the splints in for a week. Getting them out hurt and they pulled huge goops of blood and what not. Second one not as great except for the cartilage from my ear the had to graft for my nose. That hurt extremely bad. Woke up felt great tried to fight the nurse since I hate the state he's from. Then apologized when the drugs wore off. Didn't have splints or anything but got sick that night from the anesthesia. About a week and a half after surgery my nose started bleeding really bad. Like a waterfall for about 30-45 minutes at a time. After a night of that I went to the er and they didn't believe me and put some gel up my nose. About 5 days later I was laying down about to go to sleep and I feel and taste blood running down the back of my throat. I run to the bathroom and blood is pouring out my nose for about 90 minutes. I tell my wife to get my clothes and a bucket because I need to go to the er. I get to the er and they put one iv in each arm and keep putting some liquid up my nose. Next thing I know a doctor comes in with three nurses to put sponges up my nose. They wouldn't let me lean forward because I could pass out from blood loss but every time I lean forward I choke on my blood and can't breath. I keep trying to lean forward but the nurses held me down and I was coughing up blood. I passed out from pain/blood loss/not breathing and when I woke up I was covered in blood in pain about to throw up. A surgeon had to come in and cauterize my nose since there was a small hole in an artery in my nose. About 2 weeks later I smell something very bad. Like rotting flesh/raw sewage and even my friends and wife can smell it. I thought there was an infection so I called my doctor to ask and she was going on vacation so she couldn't see me but referred me to another one. He called three days later on a thursday and told me it might be a booger or an infection but couldn't see me until the next week. The next day I had this terrible taste in my mouth and felt like I had a booger in my nose. the whole day I was blowing my nose and finally something came out. The biggest booger I've ever seen. About 1.5 inches in diameter. That repeated itself every two weeks for about 3 months. Both surgeries failed","1420071015"

"wow","t5_2qio8","&gt;Even if a small server is only 20% of a market a big server is, real world companies would kill to get that.

They're not, though.  They're like 1%.  Populations in WoW aren't natural.  People go where the action is.  And people that can afford server transfers are also people that can afford to buy gold, so that's where the gold sellers go.  Not coincidentally, until a few months ago, they were also the places where you could find pugs, pvp, etc very easily, so people would congregate there.

Trust me, man, I've played on both sides and worked the AH heavily on both sides.  The money to be made on high pop servers is not directly correlated to population.  There are a lot of other factors.  I make more in a day on my high pop server than I do in two months on my low pop server.  The buyers just aren't there.  They've all either left or have no motivation to buy because they are either a tight-knit guild (since they're the only real guild on the server) or they only raid LFR and don't bother with spending money on upgrades.","1420071017"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","I'm going to take the contrarian Bills fan POV - 

A) This team had arguably one of the worst offensive lines (at least on the interior) in the league and that hampered everything Marrone might've wanted to do from running the ball (single highest yardage in a game by a Bills RB this season - Fred Jackson with 71) to calling screens (lots of Bills fans screamed for them until they saw why Marrone didn't call them a lot - the guards couldn't get outside to block

B) He had the worst quarterbacking in the league (ok, maybe bottom-5 depending on how you want to quantify it). How would we, as Bills fans, know our QBs weren't hitting open WRs deep all the time *if they weren't open to begin with?*

C) Despite that, he ended up with a winning record and went 2-1 against 3 of the top teams in the league in the last 4 weeks of the season. Yes, he lost the Oakland game. But I don't necessarily blame him for that since there was no execution 

D) Most Bills fans hated his tendency to be conservative; i.e. not throwing it enough deep (just to ""see what happens"") or not going for it enough or at the right times on 4th down, even though it's pretty clear they couldn't run the ball up the middle at all and couldn't throw it accurately and the defense was winning games, not the offense, so why not gamble on them).

All that said, I'm not heartbroken by this. Anyone but Rex Ryan will do fine. 

**tl;dr** he had lots of issues, some overblown, some not, that I disagree with, but in the end nobody is heartbroken (though some people do seem upset he'd choose long-term job security with a new team as opposed to gambling that new ownership would give him an extension after this year)","1420071017"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Dave Reisner initially packages systemd for archlinux and back in the early days it was a lot of work to run. You had to write all your own units, etc. I remember the first time I tried to switch to systemd and after that whole ordeal my system wouldn't shutdown correctly... it was in the background for archlinux for a while.

What happened was two-fold:

1. rc.conf was showing cracks. It used to configure everything but slowly things started leaving it. Stuff like `/etc/modprobe.d` or `/etc/module-load.d` landed which provided a better interface than the rc.conf file. Networking started getting too complicated to stick entirely in rc.conf so netcfg was made. But netcfg then ment code duplication with rc.conf. Backgrounding processes in rc.conf was a hack at best, etc, etc.

2. The developers, one by one, started going out of their way to use systemd over initscripts. The systemd switchover came when they realized they had no one testing the initscripts anymore. And no-one competent steped up.

Archlinux, for better or worse, revolves around the whims of the dev team. It is their baby and they make it suit themselves. With the mindshare shifted to systemd, it only made sense to transistion to it for ease of maintinance.","1420071018"

Q/W/Q/stats/Q/R/Q/Max crit/Max ward

Getting crit in the first few levels is a really silly ideology. You're trading off huge early game damage for the possibility of a crit. 

I usually rush phase and drum, and then go from there. Early game, stats are fucking critical to Jugg. His agi buff helped, but he still has a tiny HP and Mana pool. Investing into stats with both items and build will help you SO much. 

After drums, you have the option of going straight into Aghs, or heading for Maelstrom OR Bfury to accelerate farm. You skip Aghs if you're up against hard omnislash counters like Dazzle, Omniknight, Shadow Demon, Oracle etc. etc. 

Also skip Aghs if you feel like you are not ahead enough to succesfully complete the Aghs quickly. If you're a little behind in farming, Mael is a great way to catch up.

I think you become good at Juggernaut when you begin to understand which games are more dependent on your ult, and which games need to you to pretend your ultimate doesn't exist, and go for a conventional chasing/carry build. ","1420071019"

Basically, you stack the top 7 or 8 of your deck and then bounce usually 3 cards (sometimes your own Fertilizers for OTKs) and proc a ton of effects and wreck the field.

If the law were always reasonable and easy enough to follow, this would be a valid point.

Another poster made a more important point, the neighborhood ganged up against the police to protect their own, when that starts happening the police start losing control very fast. Might start getting hurt.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Pretty sure these are not real .999 gold bars (as per 09.18 on the video). 

The weird discolouration of the bars, their odd rectangular shape and comedy font, embossed lettering are all giveaways. My best guess is that these are a tungsten/copper alloy because of their pinkish hue. 

One of the most important properties of gold as a store of value is that it does not oxidize or react with anything (in nature) - it never breaks down. A gold coin can be dredged up from the bottom of the ocean after 2000 years and it will still be glistening.

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","&gt;I don't believe that is true. If it was, then Jagex wouldn't be doing targeted advertising for OSRS (yes, Jagex does advertise OSRS). 

What's this?

&gt;You're right that they would rather have us play RS3, BUT I believe that Jagex knows that OSRS appeals to a select few type of players and RS3 does not. If they wanted us to play RS3 only they would never even have made OSRS.

They made OSRS to appeal to people who didn't like EoC/mtx. At least they get some membership out of it. Money!  You said it yourself - OSRS appeals to select gamers who would never have played RS3 if OSRS was not made.

&gt;If you want evidence, just look what has happened over the past few years. Jagex has shown they do care for OSRS. They have given us 2 community managers, our own dedicated artist **and** an engine guy (and this is the very same person who helped make runescape in the very beginning, Ian).

Yeah they care because of the profit from OSRS. If there was no OSRS you can bet some of the current players wouldn't play RS3. Besides OSRS has 1/3 players and ~10 Jmods,  whereas RS3 has ~200.","1420071027"

"performancedriving","t5_2teni","The line differences you're referring to aren't specific to a car or a bike, the differences you're talking about are based more on the power, handling and weight of a given vehicle. A 600cc bike will be more dependent on corner speed than a 1000cc bike will, but if you run a stock 1000 vs. a 1000 with a lot of motor work, the stock bike will make time up on the worked over bike through corner speed. That same concept applies to cars as well.

The biggest difference I notice between cars and bikes on track is that the lines are slightly different because of the lack of width of a bike. My turn-in points are significantly earlier on a bike than on a car and my exit points are roughly the same.

Regarding weight transfer - it's a tool to help you corner more efficiently on both a car and a bike. The suspension setup on a particular vehicle plays a big role on how important weight transfer is. With soft suspension you notice weight transfer a lot more and you can use it to load the tires more to get a bigger contact patch.

Also, the transmission is for going fast, the brakes are for slowing down. Don't rely on downshifting to scrub speed.

I got interrupted halfway through this so my train of thought derailed but I hope this helps a bit.","1420071028"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I don't think anyone here said it was special and I personally think it's overrated.

The main reason why it is a big deal is because it was the first RPG in NA to be a big hit and it finally got console RPGs to be seen as more than just a niche.  It also effectively used the new storage medium it was on which is the reason Square ditched Nintendo's console and went to Sony's new console.  It was also the first rpg or first FF game for many people so they tend to remember this one fondly.  A lot of people fell in love with the storyline and characters and want to experience it again in a remake, which Square has said they will not do.","1420071028"

You have no reason to feel ashamed as long as you remain honest enough with yourself that you address this right now so that you don't cause harm to anyone down the line. Remember, simply viewing child porn causes harm because it fuels a market that abuses children. The physical and emotional health of children should always trump sexual inclinations of adults. I agree with the other poster telling you not to indulge this tendency. Good luck and take care","1420071029"

EDIT:  The school I attended was very homogenous in all those areas of diversity.  I remember clearly the times I would go to church and the other children in Catholic school were scared of me because going to public school made me a delinquent (which I was no where near being).  I have experienced so many times in my life where the Catholic school I attended fostered an atmosphere of bullying and exclusion.

There, a man sat upon a rock flat as paper. He stayed there in silence, never moving, and his breathing stable as can be. It was almost questionable from afar if the man was alive or not, for he did not move when the automaton arrived at the peak.

""I have seen you arrival."" The hermit spoke, not particularly to the automaton, but he was there to hear. ""But your fate, I cannot foretell.""

The hermit stood up from flat rock, dusting off the white robe which covered his scarred torso. All over his body, was markings of past battles, severe training, and one would presume he'd gone through even hell to bear those marks as well. All were self inflicted.

""Come on then!"" The hermit beckoned, rolling his arms with loud pops. ""Let's see what you got!"" He spun around, and from the palm of his hands, gusts of wind shot outwards and towards the automaton, in hopes to at least knock it off their feet.","1420071030"

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","&gt; Now it is also possible that this was entirely coincidental and unintended by the writers. I find it more likely that this was intentional foreshadowing on the part of the writers 

I think it's very unlikely that this was an intentional act of foreshadowing by the writers.

The Klingon invasion of Cardassia depicted in 'The Way of the Warrior' at the start of Season 4 was a pretext for bringing Worf onto Deep Space Nine and Michael Dorn into the show as a regular cast member. 

DS9 producers have stated that the conflict with the Klingons in Season 4 was an unplanned detour in the series. They'd dropped hints of the Dominion in Season 2. They'd introduced us to the Dominion in Season 3, and started setting up a conflict between the Dominion and the Federation. Season 4 was supposed to be when things heated up between the Dominion and the Federation.

However, instead, a decision had been made in the hiatus between Seasons 3 and 4 to bring Michael Dorn into the series to try and improve ratings. Therefore, they came up with the conflict between the Klingons and the Federation to justify having Worf on Deep Space Nine. This delayed the Dominion War by a year.

Given that the decision to bring Michael Dorn into the cast of DS9 and manufacture the Klingon-Federation conflict was made only during the hiatus between Seasons 3 and 4, it's *extremely* unlikely that the writers knew about this a year earlier.

Remember that DS9 was one of the pioneers of serialised long-form television - and it didn't fully commit to this concept until later in the series. Unlike its contemporary 'Babylon 5', there was no five-year plan for DS9. For the first couple of years, it was a very episodic show. They were making things up as they went along. Rather than foreshadowing later events in earlier episodes, what they generally did was use earlier episodes as inspiration for later events. A really good example of this was Odo's killing another Changeling in the final episode of Season 3. This was inspired by a line in an earlier episode, where the female Changeling had told Odo that ""No Changeling has ever harmed another."" - said in the first episode of that season. The writers have said that the inspiration for Odo killing the other Changeling was that earlier line. They basically wrote an episode based on that line. However, this was calling back, rather than foreshadowing - and the DS9 writers did a lot of this. In retrospect, we assume it's foreshadowing because we've seen so many serialised shows that came after DS9 do this. However, DS9, as a pioneer of this form of television, didn't quite know what it was doing and was breaking fresh ground. What we think was foreshadowing was usually the writers calling back to an earlier episode after the fact, rather than planning a future episode in advance.

So your solution is....there isn't really a problem so we don't need a solution? 

I don't buy that. Police misconduct isn't the biggest issue facing our country, but it's a big one. Even if it is only 1% of police officers, it's still a problem that needs a solution, it won't get better if we ignore it.

Sure, I'm more likely to be hurt by a criminal than a cop, but *so what*?

Keep in mind that at this time (early years of the 20th century), the Chinese Exclusion Act was in place, meaning that it was illegal for him to enter the States by normal means. Chinese remain the only ethnic group ever explicitly barred from emigrating to the United States in American history.

This was made even more infuriating due to the fact that I had just dropped some serious cash/time to throw her a bridal shower since her family could not do it. I was unexpectedly laid off for the summer about a week after the shower and was super stressed about paying bills when she pretty much demanded the extra money. 

She did not offer to help, just told me I would not be a part of the wedding. I got a nasty Facebook mesage from her mother and zero thanks for that fucking bridal shower. I never saw my dress or got my money back for it. Have not heard from her since.","1420071037"

3rd degree: disconnecting at Crota to freeze him (seriously, this is obnoxious), solar grenading Templar or Atheon off a cliff

The first degree is necessary to beat almost all Nightfalls, so it's not a big deal. The others tend to be done by people who just want the loot in the least amount of time.

The Skeletool has different bits that you can take out/replace, and you can get a kit with a bunch more bits that work with it.

EDIT: There are a couple different versions of the Skeletool. The regular version is fine, but the CX version has a 154CM blade, which many will tell you is a very good blade steel. I think many feel it's superior to the AUS8 used by your 5.11 Scout. The regular version uses 440HC, which is still respectable.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Haha! My personal motto is ""Nobody ever looks back on their life and thinks, 'I wish I'd had less sex'."" 

Unfortunately 20 is a *bit* too young for me, otherwise I'd take you up on your generous offer. :)

So, I didn't go to school, and it hasn't been a hindrance for me. I figured with the 50k I'd spend on school, not counting the insane amounts of interest, I could get a head start on my investment portfolio. Fortunately for me I was right. 

It also helps to be able to write and speak legibly: I'm a true believer that the gift of gab is worth its weight in gold. If you can speak to people in a manner they enjoy, the world opens up, regardless of the letters behind your name. 

That being said, I'm not *against* school, and especially if you live in a country that pays for it, by all means, continue your education. And you're right, a business degree seems like a good choice. Truth be told I was never much good at school (it's hard for me to sit still and concentrate), so it was an easy choice for me to put my money elsewhere. 

YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T HAVE TO END UP IN A BORING OFFICE JOB! There are plenty of people who enjoy the solace and anonymity provided by an office job - leave those jobs to the people who love them. Because if you don't, and if you would be miserable in such, then for fucks sake, don't do that to yourself. Even if you have a tough time finding a job - and believe me, I've been there - find something else with which to make money while you search. There are an infinite amount of ways to make cash, and the more you cultivate those, the better you get/the more money you make. For instance, I have flipped furniture, painted, sold things on ebay/craigslist, guest bartended ... really, there are so many things you can do to make money. The notion of ""The American way is to get a job in your twenties and work the same job until you're 65 and get your pension and live in your little house with your little wife until you die"" are over, man. We live in a society that now embraces creativity (which they should, as all invention comes from creative thought), and there's so much out there that's just ripe for the taking. Yes, you have to work hard. Yes, you have to sacrifice. And for fuck's sake, be on time to things - tardiness is a sure way to get the boot.

Another thing you should do is to shop around by phone.  Call a couple of places and ask for the price range you feel comfortable with.  That is a very popular size, and almost every tire shop near you should be able to look at all of the tires they have in that size and their respective costs.  Then from there, you can usually rate tire manufacturers by the warranty that they give.  If you have a discount tire near you, definitly shop around.  We usually have to match local competitors, and we do free rebalances on tires that we sell.","1420071044"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","First of all, please don't think you are doing the baby any favors by staying with the mother just to benefit the child. If you are unhappy, better yet, if you are both unhappy this is an environment that is toxic to raise a baby in. They are more perceptive than you'd think. 

Sometimes people just can't get along as a couple and being supportive and amicable co-parents is the best thing they can do for their baby. As long as you intend to support and be there for your child, you are doing the right thing. People aren't tied to others forever and the notion of staying together for the kids just doesn't work. Kids don't have the scope to imagine external factors and when mommy and daddy are spending the day unhappy and yelling at each other, they often think that this is their fault. 

Try talking to her, pregnancy hormones can really influence things but that's not really an excuse to treat a person like crap. Eventually, if you give up everything in life you're going to become resentful. You can hang out with your friends without being considered childish. 

Just tell her how you feel when she treats you a certain way. Try to be open and communicate with each other. Relationships are team work, and so is parenting. ","1420071046"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","This thread smells like COINTELPRO (if you don't know what that is or won't look it up immediately, I'd suggest cultivating interests other than radical politics). The fact that OP is repeating the DHS/SPLC witch hunt propaganda about ""sovereign citizens"" is one red flag, aside from the obvious one of advocating violent action in context with current events. Reminds me of how [this guy](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/2/25/exclusive_inside_the_army_spy_ring) actually thought anti-war protesters were actually Jihadist sympathizers and would go for that. Maybe agents that are able to really do their homework on what their targets think, build rapport, and really talk the talk aren't plentiful.

That said, TPTB already have other ways to arbitrarily hang you, threaten you, or otherwise ruin your life if they want to, other than getting you to say something incriminating. As the U.S. declines, this sort of discussion will be more common. There are certain things we're afraid to discuss philosophically and even use intellectually dishonest pacifist rhetoric, e.g. telling statists that ""the state is based on violence"", which is true, but dishonest to omit that the enforcement of our ideals would not ultimately be the same in that regard. 

I'd think it's obvious that private property and individual rights require violence and coercion to maintain against people that don't give a shit. I'm afraid that being unable to discuss how force is applied, especially during early implementation in a volatile social environment, warps our actual philosophy. I really hope that everyone here understands the distinction between defense and aggression, and has given some thought to the moral status of organized aggressors who self-identify as members of a group that is aggressive by definition, beyond the thought-terminating cliche of dismissing any common categorization of multiple individuals as ""collectivism"".","1420071048"
"JusticePorn","t5_2sokh","My little brother has paranoid schizophrenia and when he is on his meds he is the nicest person you will ever meet, but if gets off them it gets real bad. For example, there was a time I was out of work and lost my job and car. So he let me stay rent free at his place, sold me a good car for about 500$ and got me a job. If it werent for that I wouldnt have what I have now. However, last year he was off his meds and ended up going to jail for a year. It was because he was curious what our youngest brother looked like from the inside so he chased him down the road with a knife. Luckily there was a cop driving by or Im not sure what wouldve happened. I would hate to see him on meth or crack. Schizophrenia is some scary shit. ","1420071048"

Sex: assigned at birth; male or female; entirely binary; most intersex people get assigned one way or the other very early on. This is the biology part of the equation. 

Gender: often gets assigned to people along with their aab sex, but won't necessarily line up with how the person feels they are. Can be male, female, bigender, agender, or any number of nonbinary designations; self-determined by the individual. This is how someone identifies. 

Sexuality: who you feel sexually attracted to (men, women, nonbinary, anybody, nobody, etc.) Label determined by the individual: straight, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc. 

Romantic orientation: doesn't necessarily align with sexual orientation; people can be heterosexual but panromantic; homosexual but asexual; aromantic but bisexual, etc. ","1420071048"
"minnesotavikings","t5_2qocl","I respectfully disagree about Cooper. He's a born playmaker from what I've seen of him, but then again, I've only watched 10 or so of his games this season, and haven't examined his tape extensively. 

The reason that Funchess doesn't worry me as much is that he doesn't have attitude problems, a la Percy Harvin. He just doesn't run great routes a lot of the time and has too many drops. He kind of reminds me of Kelvin Benjamin, and we all know how well he turned out. I wouldn't rank him above guys like Cooper, White, or Parker, but if there's a way for us to get him on the team, I would definitely be excited about him. ","1420071048"

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Point is, minting reward does not scale with effort, it scales with stake.  Besides, 10 is a unit-less value.  If we are talking $10, then that's pretty low estimate, especially if we are talking about running on an old laptop.  That's with a really low transaction volume (ECDSA signatures are not cheap).

If you look at my linked post, then you will see that I'm not arguing for Bitcoin or one of its clones.  Bitcoin pays it's miners too much.  ASIC miners are bound to become really cheap 'smart heaters'.  It's absurd to spend so much to heat an empty warehouse.  Pay for mining at a loss instead, small miners will use mining to subsidize heating costs, and large scale mining will evaporate.  ASICs are the future of decentralized  network computing.

I'm not talking about protocol changes.  It's unrealistic to base a currency on a fixed monetary policy.  A monetary protocol must be flexible enough to allow policy changes without constantly rewriting the implementation code.  When that happens, you don't want to trust minting stakeholders with the monetary policy.","1420071048"

Next thing I know, he calls one of the guys from the warehouse and tells him to bring a ladder back there and check over the ceiling tiles to make sure no wires or anything was burning.

The guy comes in the back with the ladder and starts moving some of the ceiling tiles and checks them with a flashlight.  I told him I thought the supervisor was crazy because I didn't smell anything.

A bald man wearing a Star Wars t-shirt stumbled past, waving his arms in the air.

""Run for your life! It's the end of the world!"" The ground shook violently as smoke billowed and rolled from the hill. I backed away, then turned and ran to my vehicle, glancing behind me every few seconds. I hopped into my DeLorean and sped off, trying to dodge plummeting fireballs as I fiddled with the settings on my dashboard. August 8, 2015. That would do.

I slammed my foot on the gas pedal. 75. I swerved just in time to avoid a flaming chunk of rock. 82. I glanced sheepishly into my rear view mirror. An expanding hemisphere of pyroclastic smoke was rapidly approaching. 87. Any time now. 88. My car suddenly disappeared in a bright flash, leaving behind a trail of fire, which was soon enveloped by suffocating blackness.

I rang the doorbell, eight days in the past. A man, who resembled me to the finest detail, opened the door. His face quickly filled with surprise.

""What are you doing here?"" my identical asked.

""You know that trip to Yellowstone you're planning?"" It was a bit strange talking to my past self.""

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","There are an infinite possibilities based off of the choices you make to wind up in ""heaven"". There are also an infinite possibilities where a god would show favoritism to atheism and choose atheists to go to heaven over every other religion.

Or there are an infinite possibilities where you are worshiping the wrong god, making the real god angry. This real god doesn't mind people not worshiping him but hates people who worship fake gods.

There are infinite possibilities which can be conceived and which cannot be conceived. You are running the assumption that you must believe and worship to go to ""heaven"" when there are an infinite possibilities that it's not required.

There are also infinite possibilities where you have to kill someone, commit rape, jump off of a bridge to get into heaven.

What if you have to cut off your leg to get to heaven and you don't? Maybe in order to get to heaven you have to be an airline pilot, or a millionaire.

&gt; Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.","1420071053"

"Seahawks","t5_2ryle","Unfortunately, I think that article hurts your case, rather than helps it.

It's true, screens and a time-tested way of dealing with an aggressive pass rush. A well set up screen to a running back is a thing of beauty. A freakin' quick-out screen to a wide receiver in the flat that has been run ad nauseum to little effect all season, is not. It's a cause for groaning.

But those plays aside, Bevell is an offensive coordinator in the NFL. We play the Rams, Cardinals and 49ers twice a year, every year. Even if he suffers from some sort of short term memory loss, he has access to mountains of game film. And the Rams, and Cardinals pass rush has not changed.

So why would anyone, given our offensive line, try drop-backs against them? Why would someone have to be told by the head coach to ditch the drop-backs, and enable Russell to get rid of the ball quicker?

Speaking strictly for myself, Bevell's apparent refusal to help out his young quarterback against the pass rush is something I've complained about repeatedly. It's always ""adjustments"", and usually, not until the second half. How about getting ahead of the game a little bit?

Instead of ""drop back, almost get our quarterback killed"" then adjusting, how about assume the Rams are the same team they've been the last 4 or 5 times we've played them? If their rush gets less aggressive, THEN do a drop-back.","1420071061"

“Jake.” A voice called. “Honey.”

Then he realized he was still beating the man beneath him. His face was no longer recognizable.

He stopped throwing punches and sat gasping. It took a moment for him to recognize his wife. Then he thought of the guy he threw into the dresser and looked over. He was no longer moving. Sensing his question, she answered.

“I hit him with the lamp.” She said.

“The kids! Where are they.” He was on his feet.

“They hid in the closet. They are fine I think. Are you hurt?”

Ignoring her question he said “We have to get everybody out now.” This time there was no hesitation with her. 

She immediately went to the closet and grabbed the five year old picking him up and then took the seven year old’s hand. “Come on baby. Its ok. 

We have to leave ok?” Both were crying but came with her.

Jake led them towards the back door expecting at any moment for someone else to come but no one did. Outside the helicopters were still circling and shining their spotlights on the neighborhood. 

“The trees should hide us until we reach the ditch, then we are going to have to run as quick as we can through the tunnel.”

“Ok.” She said. 

The children stayed close to their mother as they ran across the yard and through the thicket before going down into the ditch. Finally they made the tunnel. It was large enough for an adult to stand up in. A small amount of water ran through the bottom. 

“Go!” He said, starting to feel the pain in his abdomen from the bullet wound.

"interestingasfuck","t5_2qhsa","I don't think it's rude per say. What this is intended to teach is in a situation where let's say a police officer pulls you over on your way to the park to meet up with your wife and kid to have lunch. 
He pulls you over for rolling a stop sign. You guys discuss it normally and he mentions that there is drug trafficking in your area and he would like to search your vehicle for drugs. Wells that's all good and great that he's doing his job but you do not have to show him shit without probable cause. A police officer has to have probable cause or a warrant to search your vehicle. You can deny him the ability to search your vehicle without a warrant. 

Let's turn the story. 
A friend calls you and asks for you to bring a cup of sugar with you to a party. You put it in a sandwich baggy and put it in the front seat. Same driving situation. 
He pulls you over. Sees the sugar that looks like an 8-ball and asks you to get out. At this point he has probable cause. Some people scream at them and ask to be released constantly. 
This picture doesn't say to do that. It's merely telling you what your rights are in certain situations and how they pertain to them. Of course every situation is different.

I really wish they would've used the old design of the [50 Pfennig coin](http://i.imgur.com/HaHDtJp.jpg) somewhere.

Also, the exact eagle design is ugly. That should be changed to the [2006 designed retouch](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Bundesadler_Bundesorgane.svg/643px-Bundesadler_Bundesorgane.svg.png) of the [original thing](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_%28Weimarer_Republik%29.svg/614px-Wappen_Deutsches_Reich_%28Weimarer_Republik%29.svg.png), that is, the Weinmar Republic one. Oak leaves for the smallest denominations are just fine.

And it'd be nice if the states got to get two coins or such to put their own designs on, not the [current practice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Eurom%C3%BCnzen#2-Euro-Gedenkm.C3.BCnzen) where there's a memorial coin for one state each year. Occasionally seeing a Holsten Gate is nice and the motif is perfectly fine, but actually I want a double oak on some coin as a regular thing.

The attack speed isn't necessarily wasted because you can only have max attack speed on one person every 15 seconds even with agh's. I don't think that it's categorically bad to get mjollnir on Windrunner even though I personally just get maelstrom then go for agh's, daedalus and MKB. If I was against a PL who was getting strong I would definitely upgrade the maelstrom rather than selling it so that I can clear his illusions.","1420071065"

Yes, you needed to install the bitcoin-release RPM first manually (Run: yum localinstall http://linux.ringingliberty.com/bitcoin/f20/x86_64/bitcoin-release-1-6.noarch.rpm), without it, you wouldn't find anything using yum search bitcoin as the stock Fedora repositories don't have Bitcoin in them yet.

"witcher","t5_2sebi","They had full control of space travel and lost it at some point. Not sure why (perhaps it had something to do with the Conjunction of Spheres?), but they seek to regain the control again and Ciri is their key to do so.

The Wild Hunt is able to send ghosts to the Witcher world (seemingly whenever they want) and enter the world physically (seemingly only in certain areas like the North and only during certain times); they also are able to travel to some other parallel worlds, however they are limited in their destinations until they regain their ability again.

All this is however very unclear. There are mentions of a certain Spire of time where the Hunt will finally catch Ciri (I read the books in Russian so the translation is not the most accurate one; from what I remember the King of the Wild Hunt said something like 'during your travels you will stumble upon the Spire sooner or later; and this is when we will catch you'), however I can't explain what this spire is. It is not fully explained why the Hunt sends ghosts instead of coming in person, it is hinted that it costs a lot of effort and is not time-efficient to enter the world in person. As to the reason *why* the Hunt visits other worlds - they kidnap humans and force them into slavery (Ciri meets humans in the Wild Hunt homeworld and everybody mentions people disappearing when the Wild Hunt visits an area). It also seems that certain elven magicians (Aen Saevherne) are able to travel through space; during his travels to find Ciri Geralt meets an Aen Saevherne named Avallac'h who tells Geralt of Ciri and her destiny; Ciri later meets him in the Aen Elle world (he is the first one to greet her; he is the magician who set up the whole project on regaining control over the space travel and he was destined to become Lara Dorren's husband, but she fell in love with a human).

Basically, the whole idea by elven magicians was: we genetically breed several generations of Aen Saevherne until we get a perfect child that will have the control over space travel. This child should have been the child of Avallac'h and Lara Dorren, it seems; but Lara Dorren had other plans. Several generations later Ciri, being her heir, steps in to fulfill this role, or so the Aen Elle wish. Ciri also doesn't want any part of this.

So... nothing is certain. We have some information but there is a lot of blank spaces, let's hope Witcher 3 has answers!","1420071068"
"smashbros","t5_2qiep","I have mained Mario since Melee and am pretty good with the cape (not perfect, but pretty good). Problem with Mario vs a Link is if he has any level of intelligence Links will just wait for the end lag of the cape and nail you there a chunk of the time. Paired with his sword range, hookshot, bombs, boomerang he has tons of range and priority over Mario. 
I think Mario is an OK counter but not a great counter to someone who is abusing projectiles. 
I think Mario is a much better counter for Samus projectiles. Most Samus playersw  are SO easy to read. 

I would probably try Fox because you can just sit there and not have to worry about timing.

Personally though, I can chase down Link OK but it just isn't fun or worth my time IMO. It finally occurred to me i can just SD out of the match, block the player, and start having fun again with a skilled player who also wants to enjoy the game. Punishing in previous smash games was one of the greatest feelings but it just isn't anywhere near as fun in smash 4. ","1420071068"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Economic growth partially involves carefully balancing inflation with other factors. There's a short term relationship between unemployment and inflation. This is known as the Phillips Curve. Lower inflation usually correlates with higher unemployment and vice versa. In the long run there isn't much evidence of this, but deflation is an indicator of a wide range of other economic problems. It can be an indicator of a possible recession. Hence why some countries in Europe are currently experiencing deflation. 

Of course, too much inflation is also a bad thing, and it can lead to something called stagflation, in which unemployment remains high while growth slows. Basically meaning the economy is somewhat fucked. You don't wanna be there. It's possible that Russia is or will be experiencing stagflation soon. Stagnation was rampant in the 1970s, and it arguably ruined and ended the dominance of Keynesian left-wing economic policy in much of the West.

- I'm pretty shit at COD, biggest achievement being getting into master division on BO2

- Except from COD, I play a lot of Football Manager, probably too much (and I know I am not alone on that fact), as well as the odd game of Halo, and quite a few single player games on console and PC.

- I am a season ticket holder for Newcastle United and am very happy about the exit of Pardew.

- I'm in my last year of High School, can't stand the place but hoping to pursue some sort of career in journalism/writing when I finish education.

- Started following competitive Call of Duty when I was browsing twitch and saw EGL 8 was on in MW3, and I tuned in on the game when the infamous Big T turn on took place, since then, and even though the game was kind of shit, I was hooked.
- I spend a couple of hours a day at least on Reddit, and /r/CoDCompetitive is the sub that I check without fail every single day, so thanks!","1420071072"

Uranus was named for the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos; unfortunately, the Latinized version (which was used to make it ""conform"" with the other Roman names) has become the ""butt"" of an overused joke over many years.

The Greek goddess of the earth was Gaia; the goddess of the moon, Artemis, and the god of the sun, Helios. Other cultures have their own names. There's no particular reason why Earth has to just be Earth, or the moon Moon or the sun Sun other than quirks of our inherited pastiche of European languages. Most of these are from Anglo-Saxon languages anyway, which again is a strange quirk in nomenclature when considering how most of the other bodies have Romanized names.","1420071075"

I can tell you haven't met many scientists.

&gt;Do the math of general relativity and you will come out with the exact same result Einstein did. There is no fucking questioning it. You are not arbitrarily going to get a different result every time you do the math.

""Listen and Believe' is a really bad policy when it comes to anything.  You can accept a fact as true while still understanding it could be proven wrong later.  Our understanding of modern physics relies on things like the speed of light being a limit for acceleration, but at the same time we understand how little we know about the universe.  

&gt;This is why unless you understand it, avoid talking about it. Cause ""questioning assumptions, therefore FTL travel may be possible"" is about as retarded as you can sound.

NASA has done work on a warp drive, including an idea called an [Alcubierre Drive.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive)  Obviously, all this work is purely speculative, the Alcubierre drive requires a yet undiscovered exotic material that may or may not exist, **but they are still doing it**.  How can you be so sure you're right?  Our technology is nowhere near light-speed travel, we don't have the knowledge to make absolute statements like that.  Our understanding of the universe at those kind of extremes is similar to a caveman's understanding of a computer.","1420071079"

In other fields, it may actually hamper your job prospects because you'll have 4-6 years less industry experience than your peers, yet there aren't really many jobs in the field that would truly require a PhD. Then in some fields, a PhD qualifies you for only one thing: an academic job, in an era where ""academic job"" has mostly come to mean ""adjunct with zero job security making less than minimum wage"".

""A little over a thousand years ago my people made contact with an alien race known as Jaan.  They were irrational, cat people.  First contact was a travesty and a war was begun.  For a thousand years we were merely going at each other in sparse battles.  Towards the end however things were escalating.  It finally ended on the day Mr. Byrd made first contact with us.""

""Yeah.  The president of the Jaan tried to carry out an assassination plot against my father himself.  I stopped him and got the two greatest heads of state in the galaxy to sit down with the other and broker peace.""

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;Saying, ""Gotcha, that's a good point but let's try to keep this on track."" isn't a ""waste of time"". 

Yes, it is. In that time, you could just bring things back on track.

&gt; You just talking over someone you feel isn't saying anything important is plain passive aggressive.

There's that word again, ""feel."" That someone might not be saying the most important thing isn't a feeling, it's an assertion. Try ""think"" next time.

Further, I rarely if ever think anyone ""isn't saying anything important."" I'm not a black and white thinker, and I work with competent people. At times, what one person has to say is more important than what another person is saying, probably because the point has already been made and the person is continuing unnecessarily. 

&gt;plain passive aggressive.

It would be, if I thought about my peers that way, but I don't. I think you need to learn to respect others. It would make it much easier for you to assume they respect you by default when you're working with them, and not take inconsequential interactions personally.

Also no, you cannot just shove a gelcap up there. Your asshole doesn't produce anything to dissolve the gelcap the way your stomach would. While you might be able to break the gelcap down by shooting water or a mild acid up there with it, that would be completely ridiculous when you could just mix the drug in water and shoot that up there instead.","1420071086"

"wow","t5_2qio8","Yet it seems like the only people who can track down the dupes are the RMT people. The WoW playerbase isn't a bunch of neanderthals, and there will be others out there trying to replicate any dupe or exploit that is known to exist. Also the alleged dupers are duping in the stupidest way possible as well. Why would you dupe something and put it on the AH when you could dupe say 5K darkmoon cards and just vendor them. Hell the recent exploit that allowed players to talk as a GM had far more potential to be valuable to the RMT community than simple duping and it still got out. Somehow these RMT companies  have managed to be perfectly disciplined without having a single leak ever. Seriously nobody ever has stumbled on these dupes and gone hog wild making them super obvious ever? Blizzard has a *very* vested interest that any dupes get fixed as fast as possible, we're talking information worth tens of millions to them. Yet somehow with the combined might of a full experienced development team, a bug testing team, a QA department and the entire playerbase nobody can find them, and they don't seem to appear until the price of the item being sold has dropped by 50% and there are more items on the AH than are being sold. Somehow these RMT guys are simultaneously super geniuses who can keep the exploit secret and idiots who don't start selling until the price has fallen out.

The reality is that the market gets saturated with an item causing the price to fall and a backlog to build up on the AH, there a ton of people playing the game and most people flock to sell the highest item at the time causing a glut.","1420071086"

I think I could have made all the reps with no trouble, had I not hurt myself. 

Unsatisfactory form with OHP. I got all the reps, but a couple of them were kind of sloppy. I could feel some discomfort in my back, as my body told me ""That's enough! Your form on that last rep sucks!"" It's so hard to progress!

I skipped deadlifts, due to my groin being cramped up. I did 1x3 at 60% of my normal work weight just to see how it felt, but I didn't feel like I could add weight to it or do further reps safely.

I completed all my grip work just fine. I can feel my hands getting stronger.

 [**Yam (vegetable)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam%20%28vegetable%29): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Yam__ is the common name for some plant species in the genus *[Dioscorea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea)* (family [Dioscoreaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscoreaceae)) that form edible tubers. These are [perennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant) [herbaceous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbaceous) [vines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine) cultivated for the consumption of their [starchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch) [tubers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuber) in [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa), [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia), [Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America), the [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean) and [Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania). There are many [cultivars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar) of yam. Although some varieties of [sweet potato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato) (*Ipomoea batatas*) are also called *yam* in parts of the United States and Canada, it is not part of the family Dioscoreaceae but belongs in the unrelated [morning glory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_glory) family [Convolvulaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolvulaceae).

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","Totally agree. I'm on this sub every day and would be absolutely thrilled to become a mod. But the theory from our current one (see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/2pdq06/i_thought_we_put_a_stop_to_dream_board_posts/cmvxrt8)), however is that the community is self-policing, meaning that problematic posts will be sorted out through downvotes as opposed to active moderation. I don't agree with it, but that's how things are running now. 

Reddit's moderation policy is that only mods or site admins can appoint new mods. And additionally. seniority trumps all, so that mods who were appointed earliest have say (and can remove) mods who arrived after them.","1420071091"
"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","I am finding so much bad and conflicting information about this case that it feels like my head is about to explode. 

The latest piece of conflicting information is a doozie. As I'm reading the article by David Lohr I'm thinking *this is great,up to date and he even interviewed a State Trooper that investigated the accident.* 

Then as I'm about half way through the article this catches my eye:

&gt;Hager had been visiting his girlfriend in Fairfax County, Virginia, and had left her home at about 7:45 a.m. on the day of the crash. Later that day, Hager stopped at his father's home in Gloucester County. His father wasn't there at the time, but Hager did call him at about 12 p.m.

7:45 am??? 12:00 pm???? I thought this accident happened at 1:30 am!!!!! All the information I saw prior to this article says 1:30 AM!!! Go back to the beginning of the article and read this:

&gt;That's what police found at the crash scene on the afternoon of Monday, June 26, 1995, 

AFTERNOON????? What???? Wait a minute!!! 


Did you hear that???? That was the sound of my head exploding!

I think this one can be solved if everyone that is attempting to solve it is working with the same valid facts.    

I just joined WebSluths in hope of finding some accurate information on this case. I'll post back here when I know I am basing my theories on known facts.

Just look at how many movies there are about becoming a man (Mulan doesn't count).  

However, since manliness is mostly a social construct and the gender divide is reducing rapidly, it's hard to see what it is to be a man. As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.  

Luckily, with age most of them develop a more internal idea of manhood and don't feel such a massive and constant need to prove their masculinity.","1420071093"

Veigar has high ap scaling and can abuse it even further with Q stacking people usually go dfg first. With champs in the middle I usually just look if they're building Armor/MR. If MR I rush sorc shoes, if no MR I go dfg or zhonyas or whatever.

He shook his head as he motioned the two towards the stairs. ""So tell my guards whether they are to escort you to the Wolf's Den, or to the city gates. Collect what you need upon your way.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Can't comment on Anderson's defense as 61.7% is pretty bad but he's also on an oddly poor defensive team considering they have Asik and Davis as shotblockers. I'd imagine some of the blame for his percentage allowed has to go on team defense and guards allowing too much penetration. Stretch bigs also aren't really known for their defense to begin with.

On offense, he's had a down season shooting from 3 at 34%, but last 4 years he's been consistently 38-41% from 3 at 5-7 attempts a game. He's also not even 30 yet, not sure why you're saying he's just getting by on his reputation. Montiejunas is a nice player, but he's not nearly the stretch big threat Anderson is. Montiejunas is 29% from 3 with 1.6 attempts a game... and that's actually his best so far out of the 3 years he's had.

You also have to look at their impact on offense as a whole rather than their individual numbers. Stretch bigs open up the driving lanes and open up the paint for low post players like... Dwight (Lewis in Orlando). It's also been a noticeable part of offense for the Spurs (Matt Bonner) and Suns (formerly Channing Frye) in the past. If Houston had the opportunity to trade Montiejunas for Anderson straight up Morey would have Montiejunas on the plane to New Orleans in a heartbeat.","1420071095"

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","&gt; If they rely on ""If it is legal then it is OK"" then they essentially have NO NORMS (or rather toxic norms) and the group as a whole can be called out for allowing these homophobic/racist/misogynistic behaviors to be tolerated.

That sounds more like 4chan than it does GG. However, what I fail to understand is what exactly gives you the right to invade this type of online community and tell them what to do?

The literal definition of a Bigot is as follows: a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions.

Tolerance is not Acceptance. To be Tolerant is not to Condone. Judging a group by it's ""loudest"" members is another way to Stereotype them. If there is anything I will condemn and be intolerant towards, it's bigots who seek to generalize groups of people - especially when it paints them in a negative light.","1420071097"

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","First, sympathy.  It's a difficult enough experience already, and it's doubly vulnerable when you suspect that a friend has betrayed you.  The comments I'm leaving are not meant to criticize, just to hopefully arm you with some new ideas to deal with this situation and future ones.

You're clearly worried about the possibility that all he wanted was sex, but reading through your post, I don't actually see anything about emotion.  You say you became ""sexually involved"" but don't say anything about love.  You say he was ""keen on seeing me again"" but don't say whether he was in love or just horny.  Emotion is clearly very important to you, so why don't you say anything about it?

I think the reason you don't say anything explicitly about emotion is that to you, the simple facts of having sex, seeing or not seeing each other, and texting more or less often imply everything we would want to know about what was happening emotionally.  And that just isn't the case.  The connection between sex and emotion is very complicated and flexible; it varies from person to person and from situation to situation.   The only reason we can read between the lines and guess what your expectations were is that this is a common story for inexperienced people.

I'm not even sure whether I should feel angry at him.  If he feigned emotions that he didn't feel in order to have sex with you, then that's bad and you have every right to be angry.  He failed you as a friend.  But... you don't say that.  There's so much you don't say.  If you assume those things don't need to be said, then maybe the misunderstanding between you and him came about because of your unspoken expectations and not because of anything he did to mislead you.  Maybe he was completely blindsided by your post-coital expectations and is scared to see you now because he knows you're angry.  Who knows.  I think you should call him up and have a conversation with him where you talk explicitly about the emotional aspects of what happened.

The outcome might not be what you hope for, but I think it'll be a huge relief for both of you if you can articulate what you felt, what you expected, what you thought he felt, what you thought would happen after sex, and how you feel now.  It won't be a conversation that gets you what you want — you should accept the past as past — but it will clear the air, and maybe you will be able to gauge from his response whether he intentionally disregarded your feelings and whether you want to continue being his friend.

We'll never find a way to magically violate relativity and actually make a particle with mass accelerate to or beyond the speed of light.

EVO's main events are Street Fighter, Marvel, and King of Fighters.  But the biggest Street Fighter tournament is now Capcom Cup, Marvel is declining is doomed to die, and KOF doesn't have much of a presence in the states.  Anime games are bigger at NEC, Tekken gets low turnouts at EVO for some reason, and the other 3D games are on life support even in comparison to Tekken.  Killer Instinct I'll admit I know little about, but they're hard to access since they're XB1 exclusive.

It's pretty much just Street Fighter that has a healthy scene, and they stand to grow even more with the Capcom sponsored tournaments and the release of SF5.

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","Thing is, if you've done a careful analysis and renting is clearly financially superior, but you plan to buy *anyway*, then that's outside of the analysis framework. If it's cheaper to rent, then it's cheaper to rent, and you should do that as long as possible -- it may even give you time for the market to correct and for buying to be cheaper again (the normal case, the past few years of the bubble notwithstanding) -- it's not going to be more ideal to move that purchase up sooner. 

Of course, the other thing is that the market does change and correct over time. Renting being cheaper than owning is weird, historically, and will likely not last (though that doesn't mean a crash next month -- these things take years and years to work out). 

And buying *sounds* better, ""not paying rent"" just kind of rolls off the tongue. It's a cognitive trap that's easy to fall into. But remember to look at it dispassionately because the old mantras about owning are falling apart these days. To inoculate yourself, think of a related situation: *owning* an Arizona timeshare *sounds* better than *renting* a hotel room for your vacation, but...","1420071111"

"zelda","t5_2r61g","Yeah, in both cases they are formed from Link's shadow and are similar appearance wise. 
As far as canon goes, Hyrule Historia isn't exactly the only canon, as official game guides and the information derived from the games themselves would obviously be canon, it's just not all canonically comprehensively in one place (other than HH, while touching on many topics, is lacking in full detail on many subjects) - which is where the Wikis come in. 

Anyway, another big difference between the two is intent. Dark Link usually shows up as a trial for Link - basically he must defeat himself. The method behind it's creation varies, though. Shadow Link and his multiple copies, however, show more will and is a constant, recurring foil to the 4 Links throughout their journey, not mimicking the Links, but causing chaos.

My objections at first were based in tradition, not in any silly mythological religious beliefs.  I was never really opposed to domestic partners having the same tax benefits as everyone else.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","&gt; First Question: Should I be working on crucible or vanguard rep? Obviously, I get a good chunk of each working on bounties every day, but on the ""down time"" when I am just playing the game and not working toward a bounty or daily or anything, which is a better rep to farm?

Well, both, unless you want to join a faction (New Monarchy obviously being the best choice, but there are those *other* groups, too).  If you're going to just pick one, I would recommend Vanguard, simply because you can obtain marks at a MUCH quicker rate.  

The reason I recommend both is because it lets you level up much faster (i.e., you can buy gear using both marks), and it gives you access to a wider variety of gear choices.  If you go the faction route, find the faction with gear that caters to your playstyle.

&gt; Second Question: Should I be doing a faction rep instead? I read an old guide when I first hit 20 that said as a Titan I should be getting the dead orbit faction rep first, so I was about 80% to ranking up in there when I saw on this subreddit that I should NOT be doing factions first. What is the most beneficial?

I don't know any reason to wait - if you want Dead Orbit gear, level up Dead Orbit.  If you DO go that route, you should at least be equipping DO items when playing Crucible.

&gt; Third Question: I have a few legendary guns (A rocket launcher, the zombie apocalypse machine gun, and the gun that was rewarded from doing the Dark Below quests) but I don't know of a good way to farm the materials to level them up. Is there an easier way than just patrolling the planets arbitrarily to get the mats?

You get a few materials for doing the Patrol Bounties.  You also get some from Daily missions, if I recall correctly.  Lastly, you can buy materials from either Quartermaster, at a rate of 20 mats for 10 marks.

&gt; Fourth Question: If I want to find people to party with, where can I go? There doesn't seem to be any resource in-game, and I really don't think I can solo the vault of glass or a nightfall strike (once I get to that level).

You can randomly solicit people in the tower.  /r/fireteams is a great tool.  There's also destinylfg.net.  Lastly, you can join a clan...add several of the members to your friends list, and you can join in when you see them doing it.  (PS: Soloing the nightfall is tough, but possible with the right gear...you can't solo the Vault).

If you're on PS3, you can add me.  ","1420071116"
"orangecounty","t5_2rd9x","I cant help you with much that is OC specific, but if you have questions about the VA in general or school maybe I can. I lived in HI when I got out so a lot of the things you do initially were different for me. So I have no clue about the VSO in OC. As for disability, did you get a class on that before you get out? There are online forms you can fill out and gather proof of any conditions from your medical records. That said the guys at the VSO will be for more knowledgeable. Call them and talk, they will probably ask you to come in and talk even more in depth.   
It's all pretty slow, so be patient. Disability took about two years. I am still waiting to get a primary care physician and its going on three years.

""*Performative Nick Young fandom*

As far as NBA players go, Nick Young is alright. On most teams, he would get 10 minutes per game; on the Lakers, he should probably be a starter. He takes a lot of shots, scores some points, plays bad defense, and doesn't do much of anything else at all. He's average on a good day, passably bad on all others.

And yet, basketbloggers won't shut the fuck up about 'Swaggy P' (an idiotic nickname that Young gave himself). These basketbloggers, ready as ever to feign enthusiasm for some middling player as a way to show themselves to be basketball connoisseurs of true discernment, have embraced Young like he's the second coming of Christ himself. They freak out over GIFs of him doing something slightly out of the ordinary, latch onto his every postgame word, and are waaaaaay too invested in his relationship with Iggy Azalea.

Left alone, Nick Young is only a smoldering ember of ridiculousness. But basketbloggers provide the oxygen to turn him into a firestorm of annoyance, where his off-the-court antics draw most of the attention, and the only time his play is mentioned is to collectively freak out when he attempts some off-balance 29-foot turnaround three with 22 seconds left on the shot clock. In 2015, I hope we pay as much attention to him as we do to Gary Neal. — Kevin Draper""

"RedditLaqueristas","t5_2se5q","Those look a lot like my first attempts too!

So, through trial and error I learned:

* Make sure your bottom coat is as dry as possible! You want to be able to smooth out any bubbles without having to worry about messing up your mani.   
* Make sure your tape is as unsticky as possible. It should be more like applying a window decal. I find shitty dollar store off-off brand tape is awesome for this. You can also apply the tape to your palm to pick up some oil and dirt and stuff to cut the stickiness. Don't worry! I won't transfer to your nails. 
* Try to keep your strokes going away from the edges of your tape. When you brush up against the tape, you could be squishing polish through any bubbles you might have missed. If you have a lot of lines, you can go parallel to them and it'll help.
* Plan your lines so you don't need too many coats to get it opaque. The polish that needs the most coats to be opaque should be your bottom coat whenever possible.
* Along with the tip above, don't let the polish dry for too long before taking the tape off. The drying polish will soften the polish beneath it and you might mess up your design. You should be taking the tape off once the polish is just getting sticky, but is still slightly liquid. It'll keep your it's shape and give you super clean lines. Too dry and you might get chipping. It depends on the formula though, so definitely experiment. 

These worked for me and the polishes I have. Different techniques work for different people. I have pretty low patience for day long manicures too and I usually slap on a coat of quick dry top coat as soon as I take my tape off and call it a day.

* A MOBA is some kind of multiplayrt RPG  where two teams try to take each others base down,  but Aerena is only roughly based on it, so it would make more sense to explain Aerena itself: two players fight on a small arena, and try to take each others ship down. This can be done by attacking the ship directly or by killing enemy champions. Each side controls 3 champions, who have 2 special abilities each. The matches are fairly short (10 min) and packed with action: except for the first turn you will keep fighting until the end.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","I asked the realtor specifically how many bedrooms each unit was and she wasn't certain.  I asked the realtor specifically how much each unit was renting for and she only knew what 2 of the 3 units were renting for.  She said that the home owner wants out bad, and basically said the owner doesn't have the ability to ask the current tenants for more rent (because she doesn't have the backbone) and as a result the 2 units that are currently rented are probably about 20% below what other similar units are renting for (This is from my research, not from the realtor).  She also said that the home owner probably doesn't have a good record of all the documents I was asking for...I asked for rent roll, expenses, etc.  The home is actually in a pretty nice neighborhood.  We drove the street and looked at other houses, there are some nice amenities close by.  

Also...the realtor said that the 3rd unit, the one that she didn't know how much the home owner was charging for, is currently occupied by a family member.  I really hope she's not going to come back and say the family member is living there for free...or that the family member is living there without a lease.

We haven't currently selected a buyers agent for us.  Do CRE consultants work the same way as a residential real estate buyer's agent in that they split the 6% commission with the sellers agent?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Pokemon.  The world is clearly post-apocalyptic.  Kids leave their home at an early age not out of choice but out of necessity.  There simply isn't enough resources or habitable space in each town to support a growing population.  Why do you think a lemonade costs more than medicine?

Also, why do you need to gather novel data on animals that should have existed alongside mankind for thousands of years?  It's because much of human knowledge has been lost after society collapsed.  This explains why grass on the outskirts of town can contain dangerous, wild beasts.  Pokemon Gyms and the Elite Four are such a central aspect of life because in this world, power is the only thing that is respected.  Pokeball technology is merely being tested on Pokemon.  Once perfected, it will be used for humans in order to, again, minimize the resources needed to sustain life.","1420071128"

Asking them questions to reflect on themselves. I've seen some stories of people telling trans girls that they are trans and stories of people telling trans girls that they are not trans. Both stories have bad consequences to the trans girl's mental state (one being that they weren't ready to believe they were trans, and the other that someone telling them they aren't trans made them go back to square one). 

So seriously, it might not seem like it, but telling someone who you think they are isn't a smart plan. You honestly don't know, and you might do harm.","1420071129"

Like you said, it's a great game, but the way they are trying to make maximum profit out of barely any content is killing this game. The monthly updates were fun to keep us occupied, in my mind, until we got to hear the announcement for an expansion. Now it's pretty obvious that wasn't their goal : it was meant to keep us playing permanently solely on the living world. Now 2+ years later when we have all exhausted every available content 1000+ times, there's nothing to say to defend the lack of expansion anymore. Half the reason I still log in (solely for the free daily chest) is the hope of an expansion. Since this summer I have been barely active. All I'm waiting for is a new great game to come out and I won't be playing Guild Wars 2 anymore.... sad honestly only 2.5 years in.

Pretty fascinating stuff. I wouldn't go long BLCM b/c it's more just icing on the cake (reducing potential side effects). My call is the BLCM gets bought by one of the larger CAR T-cell guys. 

In summary, I agree  ONCS and CAR T technologies aren't mutually exclusive in the market, but when it comes to heme malignacies I'm going to put my money on the likes of CAR T.","1420071134"

"Thetruthishere","t5_2sntx","Ah~! Thank you very much for the question! 

I was around 20 when I first started channeling. But I've been having experiences my whole life. It was only around 20 that I found out exactly what was going on, and really became able to control what was happening to me. 

I found out through blind ghost box sessions. I would put on headphones so that I couldn't hear any of my friend's questions, and I would just say what I heard through it. That got us some pretty good results, and eventually they started talking about what I was and what I could do. From there, I just started having things come through me. It was a sort of this-is-the-right-time sort of thing. 

My main sources are things that you could call guardians. They go by a couple different names, but that one's pretty explanatory on what they are. 

As far as what I've heard about 2015 through different sessions, they seem to think there's going to be a fair bit of turmoil. They've been on this since 2014, though, and they seem to think that each year is bringing more things lining up to create an eventual breaking point. 

They don't think that breaking point is an apocalypse or something like that. From what I gathered, though, we're leading up to something 'world-changing'. From context clues, they seem to be referring to something along the lines of either another world war, or perhaps a world-wide rebellion/revolution that changes the way things are done? Something that really overhauls some of the old ideas in law, economics, and science.","1420071136"

You can then delete the existing partitions, and you should see something like this:

he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your speeches
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Pba,ano one does

Before I made the switch to 5e I started giving people benefits for knowing exactly what they wanted to do when their turn started (such as a +1 to the attack roll, not game breaking but definitely made it go faster). Combine that with limiting the amount of time for someone's turn to a minute and you'll have a pretty fast combat. Also if the players are trustworthy (I have a guy who would've fudged his rolls if I had done this, but I'd have let others do it) they can even roll for attack and damage before their turn. If all those numbers are ready to go then each turn can occur in 10 seconds or less.","1420071142"

You can definitely find live music just about every night of the week in Denver- a lot of it for free, and some of it quite good. Westword is my go to for finding free live music.

Capitol Hill and Cheesman Park are the most popular areas for people in their 20s. I never really considered these areas because of how inconvenient they are for public transportation. I'd suggest looking at apartments near light rail stations- specifically the 10th and Osage station, Broadway Station, University of Denver station, and Colorado Station. Try the location based search on padmapper.com. 

There are new apartments popping up all over the place. I live within a 5 minute walk from a light rail station and I pay less then 800 a month in rent for a fairly large 1 bedroom apartment. I regularly take the light rail when I'm going out for drinks- south Broadway is one of my favorite areas and it's an easy 10 minute walk from the Alameda station. The Santa Fe Art district is about a 5 minute walk from the 10th &amp; Osage station and has an awesome First Fridays event with free admission to all of the museums.

Of course, there's the coldly pragmatic 'it will happen, don't question it, just protect yourself' with which we can all agree.

Hours, even years, of earnest work can be destroyed in the aftermath of heists like this.  These hackers are not robots, they're humans, so why do they do it?  You may call it inevitably ugly human nature, but I was brought up not to do this kind of thing. Presumably you were too... so what is it?  Economic need? Notoriety? Ignorant curiosity?  It's great that we share these precautions and adopt a protective mindset, but honestly I think as a community we could be less blithe about our acceptance of hacking risk.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","&gt;First Question: Should I be working on crucible or vanguard rep?

If you play more PvE, like strikes, raids and story missions. Level up vanguard. If you play mostly PVP/crucible level up faction rank. Factions only take crucible marks as currency, so leveling them up while getting vanguard marks is a waste of time. I put on faction gear only for crucible.

&gt;Second Question: Should I be doing a faction rep instead?

I would recommend only working on vanguard rank til it's level 3 unless you play mostly crucible.

&gt;Third Question: Is there an easier way than just patrolling the planets arbitrarily to get the mats?

You can buy 20 materials for 10 marks from vanguard and crucible quartermaster. You may have to be a certain rank to do so.

&gt;Fourth Question: If I want to find people to party with, where can I go? 

I prefer /r/fireteams but destinylfg.net is popular too. These are the best options.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","But I mean if you are at 8000 rpm in 1st gear, and your 2nd gear ratio is so that you will be at 6000 rpm, the final drive helps decide at what speed you're going at. I get what you're saying, but I'm more worried about staying in the powerband. 

4.9 final drive, 3.23 1st gear, 2.3 2nd gear
You could be going at 33 mph in 1st gear at 8000 rpm. You shift into second and now you're doing 6000 rpm, still at 33 mph. 


4.266 final drive, 3.23 1st gear, 2.3 2nd gear
You could be going at 40 mph in 1st gear at 8000 rpm. You shift into second and now you're doing 6000 rpm, still at 40 mph. 

The RPM drop from gear to gear is the same (-2000 rpm), so if you have gears carefully made for your powerband, changing the final drive ratio isn't going to ruin it. Your possible RPMs at different speeds, of course, will be different. ","1420071149"
"visualnovels","t5_2r5yf","&gt;Yes, it's the weakest of the five, but it's solid.

Really? I always thought that hers was one of the better 3 routes. I thought Asuho's and Aoi's were bland. 

&gt;Two things screw her route though. The H scenes, more so than the other routes, just felt like pandering.

The biggest problem with them was that Chinami felt like she had the brain of a 10 year old, and you can imagine how awkward having sex with an idiot would look. 

&gt;Really, the only downside of their routes was ~~no threesome~~ needing to suspend one's disbelief a bit, but the VN did a good job of explaining everything that needed to be explained, and at the end of the day, that's really all I ask.

To me, the biggest downside of their routes had to do with the way they're set up. [spoiler] (/s ""Komomo's route starts off making you think it's going to be about her, but then we figure out it was Kosame all along, so her own route was more about Kosame than her. Kosame's route was ok, except that you essentially knew most everything going into her route which ruined a lot of chances for nice buildup and suspense that her route could've had. Also the fandisc has a threesome with both of them, so rejoice"")

&gt;All that's left is the true route.

Well, get ready, the true route is by far the best route in the game so you'll probably enjoy it a lot if you thought the other routes were good. ","1420071149"

I get that people think it's gross to be overweight and it's something that can be changed, but that doesn't mean you have to be cruel to a person just because you don't like how they look.

The best part is being an awesome cuddler. Everyone who isn't a complete dick to me because of my weight thinks I'm amazing to cuddle and hug. I love hugs, so that's the best. When I was skinny I was always told to stop because I was top bony. 

Then there's clothes. I'm not exactly a fashionista, but sometimes I like to look nice and clothes that look amazing on thin women do NOT look amazing on me.

"askaconservative","t5_2vg6d","&gt; No, by definition Fascism and Communism are complete, polar opposites of one another. Social welfare is in the middle (slightly left).

There's no possible way they could be ""polar opposites"" considering fascist economics were derived from syndicalism and socialism, although I will say they may have certain traits than can be seen as opposite of each other (e.g. Universalism vs Nationalism). I'm saying that many ""Fascists"" find common grounds with social welfare democracy and communism in their pushes for class egalitarianism, you haven't properly refuted that point. 

&gt; That's why almost all of the criticisms from the Right are ignored. If you're going to criticize someone pick a specific criticism and stick to it. Oftentimes it seems like the Right are throwing scary words at the wall and seeing what will stick.

Antagonistic comments like this, are they really necessary? It's not much different than leftists accusing neoliberal parties such as UKIP, Tories, or the G.O.P. as being ""fascist"". The left is much quicker to throw pejorative terms around than the right is. ","1420071153"

I'd start upgrading by getting good offensive/defensive lineman and a good HB. Rising Star Denard Robinson is only 2k, and if you buy 2 of him you can put both into a set(make sure you look at both of the Robinson's chemistries and put them both in the correct set) and he goes froms an 80 to an 87 plus he's a really good speed back and should help your team if your new.","1420071155"

"ExplainLikeImCalvin","t5_2sp85","Wilhelm was a mystic/fortune teller hired by Hollywood to study the upcoming trends. He predicted the end of silent movies, the end of the single-actor/single studio contracts, and the rise of the summer blockbuster.

Everytime they went to see Wilhelm, they brought an audio recorder so they could listen to him prophecying and make sense of it later on.

But on that fateful day, April 13, 1921, Wilhelm bore witness to something so terrifying, he was unable to do anything but scream.

Sadly, Wilhelm had to be committed to the Beverly Hills Home for the Cinematically Insane soon after. Hollywood mourned the loss of one of their greatest assets and honored him by taking that recorded scream and placing into movies. For every movie that the scream was used in, Wilhelm and his family got a check every time that movie was aired or rebroadcast, because back then, Hollywood protected its own.

Just before his death in 1971, there was a call from the Home. Wilhelm had woken up and was lucid. He was calling for the heads of the studios to meet with him one last time.

When they arrived, the studio heads asked Wilhelm what he saw that scared him so much. He told them he could not say the name, as it would bring the screaming back. But he would write it down.

As he wrote however, his heart gave out and the message was unfinished. The only thing he had managed to write was ""Beware M. Nigh...""","1420071156"

The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine.

Personally I'm well past taking the assertions of the news author and look to the study, with a decent understanding of what scientific studies are attempting to do and the reality of statistics. I guess I have a way of assuming that other readers do the same, at least in an environment like the science subreddit.

The double-edged sword of scientific studies is they boil questions down to single-variable problems that are testable, re-testable, shareable between other researchers, etc. Because science is based on the formulation of hypotheses, the testing of those hypotheses with well-structured and repeatable experiments, and then the repeating of those experiments for confirmation. But real issues in the real world are complex, multi-variable things which require the human intuition to look at many studies, many facets, posit reasonable guesses, check for logical consistencies, and understand the system at work. Evaluating complex multi-variable system honestly leaves the realm of direct ""science"", but if such hypothesized systems are likely to be correct, then single-variable scientific studies will confirm aspects of that system and/or be consistent with how the system works with itself. Science is a tool far more than it is a creator of answers; the answers are created by the creatures that ask the questions: human beings. So if you were so philosophically inclined, you could dismiss the entirety of science as confirming the reality we built ourselves, but that's not very practical is it? It's certainly not something the empiricists would get on board with!

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","In AZ you can get a DUI for a variety of things that don't include driving. When I got mine, I was at a bar one night and had too much to drink. I called a cab to pick me up. When it got there, I had him stop by my car so I could grab my laptop bag that I didn't want to leave out overnight. There was a cop in the parking lot already, but I didn't think anything of it. He came racing over and busted me for DUI because I was ""in control of a vehicle"" even though I was only grabbing a backpack out and it was blocked in the parking spot by my cab. 

I ended up having to take several weeks of alcohol abuse classes among other things, because anyone who has more than one drink at a time has a problem apparently. During the classes we covered different cases of people getting DUIs and what could get you in trouble. Obviously don't drink and drive. But don't be in your front yard with your car keys on you if you've had a drink. If you're within a certain distance of the vehicle you're still in control of the vehicle. Don't drink a beer on a hot day while mowing your lawn, a mower is a vehicle. One guy got a DUI while trying to fix his car in his driveway. The engine didn't start, but he was drinking a beer while working on it. One old woman got a DUI after church because someone hit her and the communion wine registered on the breathalyzer as a .01 and she had a grandkid with her. That one was a felony because of the kid. Another person got a DUI after leaving a hospital and driving too slowly. She told the cop she was tired after working a double shift then visiting her sick mother. You can get a DUI if the cop thinks you're too tired, and she got her 2nd DUI that way even though she had nothing in her system.

Drinking and driving is flat out stupid. But a lot of the laws now are just insane and geared towards making the states money.","1420071160"

"civ","t5_2rk3b","- You can actually settle 4 cities and be able to take an AI capital before renaissance Era, I've done it once (because I'm usually close to the AI).

- Two cities = more science because they can grow freely and the more cities you get the more science you'll need to get techs. Two cities (Capital + free settler from liberty) Allow you to get all your tiles improved by workers. It also help you to not care about happiness because you'll have just two cities. Two cities is the best way to rush some tech and an early army to take one or two Ais before renaissance era. More cities make it harder and in the late game it doesn't make a real difference... In my opinion.

- I'm one of the best not the best I don't think you can be the best at that game. By this I mean I'm one of those that can win deity. When you read the definition of ""deity"" in civ it says : only the best player will succeed or something like this. I say ""one of the best"" instead of a deity player.

- Random policies because I can win deity with piety and dodge rationalism. I can win deity with any kind of policies because it's not what make you win the game, of course you can try hard, I did try hard when I made my let's play as mongolia, I won the game (7ais) before entering industrial era, didn't even get the chance to really pick policies, but that's what make the game interesting and fun, it's to play all policies and strategies.

- Go wide early, build 4 cities and go tradition, I bet you two cookies that with my one city in liberty and my Great scientist I'll get my keshiks, berzerker, samurai, camel archer etc... before you and I'll end the game quicker. Maybe you can, but I'd love to know how you do it cause I can't. The huns is one of the rare rush civ, I do go to war really early with them, that's why I go liberty, no time to waste in cities and settler I spam tons of units and take two capitals, it's better to get two capitals and have on city than three cities. (Let's remember that we are talking only about domination game here and that you win it by taking capitals.)

- You already took two capitals before renaissance era or in it with tradition? I can't I tried and I never saw anyone doing it in brave new world... Liberty is great for one city rush science and wide. You can't win through domination with tradition and waiting indusrial era, unless you aren't playing on standard and you play england on a sea map. If you can I'm curious to see it.

- I can win deity with the iroquois through domination, as I can with poland, so for me it's balance, it's easier with poland maybe, it's more fun with the iroquois. What matter it's the end and at the end you can win with all civs.

- Sweden? Get everyone friendly and enjoy 50-70% or more great people generation. You'll go to space quickly like this or maybe win diplo before info era because all CS are your allied because it's easy to get them allied. Beside the fact sweden is strong, what make them the best civ in the game for me is : They are fucking fun to play. You basically just go to war and get all city states allied with you by doing this, never have to worry about culture, faith or happiness, you'll also be able to get a lot of UU, i had camel archer, longbowman and samurai in one game once. Every true warmonger love sweden as much as the Zulu or the huns. Then you have babylone if you want, it's so fun to play them. :)","1420071161"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Open-world RPG where you play as a werewolf.  Not like Skyrim, where werewolves were just a sidequest thing.  Progression would be based on A) learning to use werewolf abilities, and B) regular human skills.  The player gets to choose whether they focus on their human or wolf side more, or even trying to balance both.

The NPCs would have proper AI that lets them react to events in the world, based on a knowledge system that tracks what every person knows (or believes they know, if they were deceived or mistaken).  The main story would progress dynamically based on the actions you take, and I mean that literally.  It wouldn't be ""choose A or B"", but rather you'd have a bunch of different people and werewolves that you can chose to help or hurt, and they react accordingly.  The world would also be dynamic, with events occurring constantly (like werewolf attacks, hunting parties, or even human-on-human or wolf-on-wolf raids between different factions) that the player can choose to take a side in or just sit and watch as they see fit.

Ideally, the player should be able to do what every they want, whether that's being a friendly neighborhood werewolf, a hunter-of-his-own-kind driven by vengeance, a brutal monster that strikes terror in people, or whatever else they see fit.  Their actions should help shape the world as well, e.g. by having the groups they help get stronger, and perhaps even changing their opinions on werewolves depending on how the player acts.

I don't agree with the majority of changes they did to some of the lesser played exotics and legendaries, especially some of my favorites like Bogwood Mireoak and Krikkinwing Alpha, but it seems like they generally listened and responded to the playerbase's wishes.

Still no quality of life updates out of them.  You still have to make an account on their website and manage the runes through it, and fullscreen mode still looks bad.

The rotation is fun and it's not always the same, it's not consistent like most are, it changes depending on procs and that affects how your cooldowns line up so there's a lot of mixup going on.

Not sure how BM plays but I find MM very boring, though I believe it's #1 spec for singletarget. MM is basically casting Chimaera Shot on cooldown, spamming Steady Shot until you can Aimed Shot, rinse and repeat.

Survival also has you thinking a lot about how much focus you can use, you have to know if you'll have enough focus when Explosive Shot and Black Arrow comes off cooldown, so depending on that you need to Cobra Shot or dump with Arcane Shot. MM is usually easy in that way, you almost never focus starve.","1420071165"

* A big fancy house for yourself, of course. I have a castle in my spawn town, some nice apartments in my desert city and mining colony, and a big waterfront mansion in my harbor town. Working on adding a personal airship for the desert city: I just repurposed the lighthouse into a docking tower, and have been collecting wood and wool for the gasbag and gondola...

* A pleasant waterfront district, if you're close enough to navigable waterways: think marinas, waterfront parks, bridges, eateries, fountains, etc.

* Since it's a mountain build, you can add heaps of bridges and tunnels, and maybe some terraced neighborhoods.

* Commercial infrastructure, 'cause folks gotta work! Decide whether it'll be a farming town, mining town, manufacturing center, trade hub, and so on, and build according to that idea.

* The obligatory [Absurdly Spacious Sewer](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer), and maybe a [Creepy Cathedral](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCathedral). I like having a ""dungeon"" of sorts in or near town: one of my towns includes a walled-off haunted cathedral (no lights, an underground Creeper temple, and connections to a network of tunnels under the city), while another one has extensive sewers that feed into an underground ravine system that leads all the way down to bedrock.

And Switzerland is above the U.S. now, Germany is near equal but you underestimate the drag rebuilding East Germany has long had, Denmark is again near equal and Sweden is, well, fucking Sweden. And life as a salaryman in Japan is not exactly smiles and roses, which factors in a bit too.

&gt;larger issues with Sweden

And here I thought Sweden was some perfect utopia that makes Aus *""look like it belongs in a Unicef commerical""*.

The thing is, no matter how you spin it, the fact is that riot was instigated and largely made of people from refugee/immigrant communities, and those same people *are* overrepresented right there in the crime stats.

Yet this is despite Swedish society rolling out the red carpet for them. Just goes to show that *maybe* being *thorough* in processing asylum seekers is a good thing. Thank fuck our gov is not as insane as Sweden.

&gt;""Immigrants are all naturally going to commit violence, rape and crime"". 

If by that you mean if one lets people claim asylum from the third world en masse with no serious checks, many of those allowed in will be less than peaceable and not integrate properly, yes. Again the stats are *right there* and they do not lie.

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","Gear is as follows: Guthans helm, chest and legs with spear in inv. God cape, trident, b gloves, inf boots occult and either malediction ward or blessed spirit shield; I prefer using blessed spirit shield because of the defensive bonuses with no negative magic attack bonus. If you want, you can also take fire cape, fury and whip in inv for when you're full hp in the tunnels. The barrows brothers have really low mage defence so your mage attack bonus doesn't really affect much, but I guess you knew this.

 Spellbook should be on ancients; the strategy for the melee brothers is to ice blitz, step away and use trident. For karil, just pray range. For ahrim, you can either melee him (in which case you'd have to flick piety and/or take a super set) or range him; I prefer to range him with karils bow as the attack speed is two times faster than ahrim's; timed right, this allows me to flick both protect from magic and eagle eye (hint: use quick prayers), without taking any damage and getting a better DPS.

 My order is Dh, karil, ahrim, verac, torag and finally guthan. On the first chest of the trip, 70 prayer will get you all the way round with a few ppoints spare. Subsequent chests will require you to either drink a prayer potion on dharok (if you aren't feeling up to kiting/tanking him) and possibly another on ahrim. If you want to save a dose per chest, go into dharok's tomb as usual and freeze him then start using trident. Once you feel he's going to unfreeze, run around the other side of the tomb and wait a few seconds until he can be frozen again. From here, cast another ice blitz on him and you should be able to finish the kill off. Praying against karil and ahrim is almost a must, as you'll be carrying little to no food. If you get any of these 3 in the tunnel, don't risk it and just drink a dose of ppot anyway. You use the guthans to heal yourself up in the tunnel whilst getting killcount.
 
 Inv set up would therefore be spear, range gear (black dhide or karils armour and a weapon), fire cape fury and whip if you wanted them, ice blitz runes, spade, restore pot, a few sharks and several prayer potions. You'd have to test out the number of ppots/sharks cause i've never actually done this method (too poor lol). Also take a duelling ring for quick restoring of hp/pray/stats at clan wars. Good luck :D","1420071177"

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","**Title**: Super Smash Brothers 5. This wouldn't work for most numbers (Smash 10 would sound very tedious), but 5 is a good number, and, imo, the upper end for numbered titles.

**Mechanics**: More towards the fast side of Melee, but with some pacing influence from 64.

**Gameplay mechanic**: Maybe tilt-b moves, generally being faster but weaker versions of the full-b. Expand walljumping to every character, and buff it in general.

**New Gamemode**: Built in Crew Battles! They've done the basic idea in Subspace Emissary, but not in normal vs. modes.

**Remove Gamemode**: Cruel Smash ^^^totally ^^^not ^^^because ^^^it ^^^makes ^^^me ^^^rage

**New Advanced Tech**: More teching options. I.E.: Shield+A during the tech window makes you getup-attack on landing, Shield+Down makes you spotdodge, etc.

**Remove Advanced Tech**: L-Canceling. I generally lean in the camp that mindless tech skill has no place, so this is the obvious choice for me.

**New additions**: Isaac (Golden Sun), Elite Beat Agents (either IC or PkmnTrainer mechanics), Baby Mario + Baby Luigi (again, IC mechanics), Splatoon character, unspecified Pokemon from the newest gen whenever the game is to be released.

**New 3rd Party Editions**: Bayonetta (technically 3rd party, right?), Shadow the Hedgehog (and I'd try not to make him much of a clone).

**Removed characters**: I'd remove Dr. Mario and Dark Pit, but if clones aren't an option,, Ike and Lucario (step aside, let some new Pokemon get the spotlight).

**New Removed Characters**: Wii Fit.

**Returning Vet**: Pichu.

**Stage Gimmick**: A stage that dynamically builds itself as the camera moves with the players. I.E.: both players run left, new stage and platforms are built to the left. This stage would have the hazard kill things from the Great Cave Offensive stage, and if you move faster than the camera, you can still go outside the stage and die.

**4 New Items**: Ink Gun (the Splatoon weapon), Random Item Box (Mario Kart: afflicts you with a random status in the game. Could be ice, curry, flower, or it could even heal you, etc.),  Microphone (from Kirby games), Boss Galaga (saw it in Smash Tour, scrambles location of all players. One second you're on stage, the next, you're not).

**Four Cut Items**: Back Shield, Gust Bellows, Gooey Bomb, Sandbag

**New Final Boss**: The Laughing Face of Reggie Fils-Aime. I've heard it's nigh unbeatable on even the lowest difficulties, especially as Jigglypuff.

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","Well, I imagine that potions have specific amounts of ingredients. You mentioned Dwarven Oil. If we look at its effects in Skyrim:

&gt;&gt;Weakness to Magic

&gt;&gt;Fortify Illusion

&gt;&gt;Regenerate Magicka

&gt;&gt;Restore Magicka

If you choose to drink some dwemer oil in the game, it'll have a negative effect of making you weak to magic. A lot of ingredients which are ""poisonous"" have both positive and negative effects. 

Another example of an ingredient is the River Betty (a fish):
&gt;&gt;Damage Health

&gt;&gt;Fortify Alteration

&gt;&gt;Slow

&gt;&gt;Fortify Carry Weight

Here is my understanding of alchemy on the two example ingredients

For the Dwarven Oil, its magical properties are dependent on **how** you prepare and mix the oil. Drinking the oil in its pure state will make you weak to magic. Mixing the oil with an ingredient which has one of the same effects as the oil will make a potion with that effect (but it will also most likely have a downside such as weakness to magic). So, we can infer that it is the preparation which determines the effects. Perhaps you must mix in the second ingredient before the dwarven oil and add the oil while the potion is boiling. You get the gist.

The second example is of an animal with organs - the river betty. Attempting to consume a river betty will damage your health. This leads us to the conclusion that there is a poisonous thing inside the betty (it could be an organ, the blood of the fish, etc). However, there are also beneficial things inside the betty. Since consuming a betty damages your health, we can assume that either the meat, blood, or a major organ in the river betty is poisonous. However, a river betty can also be used to fortify alteration, to slow, and to fortify carry weight. I like to imagine that various organs inside the fish have different magical effects. Perhaps the spine of the fish fortifies your carry weight. Perhaps the brain fortifies alteration. Perhaps its heart slows you for whatever reason.

If you're a novice at making potions, you can just throw a river betty and some netch jelly together in a potion which will fortify your carry weight. Since you're blindly throwing in the whole fish, the potion will also damage your health.

However, a master alchemist understands what must be done to properly prepare ingredients. In order to make a carry weight potion with no harmful effects, an alchemist must first pass the netch jelly through a filter (to remove the part of the jelly which causes paralysis) and then carefully cut the spine out of the fish, grind it, and boil it in the potion. 

I made all of this up, but you get the idea","1420071178"

The valdore console, RSP, Dyson shields, ST/TSS/ExS/RSF/whatever have you, [even Thon's already asking about how to get through shields](http://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/2qyeat/shield_penetration/), since shields are generally hard to get down in PvP.

Once you get past the shields in PvP, most people will be flying around with high hull resist (skill points+most hull heals+eclipse trait+APO/APD+EF+whatever it is) that you also have to go through.

Point being, if I'm PvP'ing someone, I might take 10 seconds to burn through an 80k hull, if I can do it by myself at all, because I basically have to do it via shield penetrating damage. Spike counts more there as well, and the elachi proc spikes much higher than an AP proc in PvP.

---

Antiproton makes your hits hit harder, and you've got hundreds of thousands or sometimes millions of hp to burn through on an enemy in PvE, and higher hull resist NPC's are nearly non-existent (the final boss, usually, but nothing leading up to it).  Antiproton is an impossible single proc to beat if your goal is raw dps, because you'll just be critting bricks time and time again at things. Shield penetration on one shot here or there makes no difference, because while a 15k shield bypassing hit matters in PvP, it makes 0 difference in PvE.

---

Basically, it comes down to higher resists and vastly lower hull in PvP, and all the heals present in PvP favoring shield and hull-bypassing spike, while PvE just asks for [more dakka - Warning - TV Tropes - be prepared to lose a few hours.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka)","1420071179"

There is no camera that can actually see a single electron or a single photon, so the detectors that are used to ""observe"" the particle passing through one slit or the other have to introduce energy into the system. This energy that is introduced is what changes the behavior. It is definitely a really strange and unexplained quantum behavior but it certainly isn't scientific proof that reality is dependent on a conscious observer.

"FraggedEmpire","t5_32pwq","Hi Boocho, thanks for the awesome write up mate :) It’s great to read about your game.

&gt; The players had their turrets, but they were too expensive for them to maintain with their current resources scores. They ended up breaking them down to archon goods trade boxes and selling them for a decent profit upon return.

It is great to read about how you handled this situation :) I know the Resources/Spare Time Points/Trade Box system can be a little tricky at times. But it really sounds like you have a great grasp on how it can be used.

&gt; It was a good way to let the players mess around with archon tech for a bit before having to give it up.

AHHH!!! This is so exciting for me to read! It has always been a little tricky in RPGs to give PCs access to temporary fantastic equipment. In most games, the GM has to come up with a heavy handed story idea (eg: limited special power sources, limited use magical artefact, etc…), or risk having their game become unbalanced. The method we have allows your players to enjoy some cool, awesome tech, blast some bad guys and then they get a tangible award that makes sense.

&gt; working toward unlocking the martial arts trait

That’s an awesome trait :) I know it will take a long time to get it :)

&gt; which appeared to be focused on finding a way to control feral Nephilim through a psionic technology

Nice plot idea!

&gt; The players started in pursuit of the enemy ship, and even though I was making 2 command rolls per turn to alter speed and direction I failed nearly every single one. This was really due to bad rolls

Darn, that’s a pain. Such bad luck makes it really hard to gauge how the well the Spacecraft combat rules would have worked.

As a side note: just as NPCs gain +2 to all of their To Hit rolls, they will also be given +2 to all of their System Rolls (to balance them against the PCs who will have bonuses).

&gt; We also had the enemy ship trying to jump away, which added that battlestar galactica feel to the combat, which was quite neat.

Yep, just what I was going for :D Also, the Millennium Falcon tried to do this as well.

&gt; All the players felt busy, and there was enough variety to keep them interested.

Nice. How many players do you have again?

&gt; We had a bit of trouble understanding the dumb fire rules for warheads, but were able to get there in the end.

Sorry about that. Where these worded poorly?

&gt; I can see that there is a list of size traits – is this the standard way to alter the size of a ship during gameplay? And is this intended to reflect the differences in bigger ships vs smaller ones?

Yes, Traits are what are used to change a ships Size. Balancing combat between different Sized ships has been quite tricky and I feel like we need to do a lot more playtesting to get the stats right.

&gt; It might be nice to have spacecraft traits come in a slightly more varied costs than the standard 5 per trait, and a couple of cheap options would be welcome too.

I agree. There are a few cheaper and more expensive Traits, also there are a few different Weapon options that cost a varied amount of Influence.

There are not as many options for Spacecraft as there are for Characters, this is mostly due to time and space(pages) constraints :(

&gt; Just a suggestion, but maybe you could reference the idea of increasing/decreasing the number of sessions to level up as a way of changing the pace of the game under the optional game types section on page 29?

Yes, I have just finished writing an entire page on this topic. Exploring the different Game Types that GMs can make by having High or Low rates of progression. Not just in Levels, but also the other forms of advancement.

Eg: A High Level, but Low Resources game could give a real Firefly feel to a game. While a low Spare Time Point game could give a real Survival feel.

I want GMs to feel free to tweak these different forms of advancement to fit their game style.

Thanks again for all your awesome feedback mate, I REALLY appreciate it.

"Etsy","t5_2qq24","I sell Glass Marble Magnets. And while it would seem that since the pattern is the same they do look very different to me. I would make different listings. And with the different listings you'll have more items which will be seen more times in the search engine.

For instance, the goldfish pattern is a clear tangerine with orange and white swirls. Some of the swirls are thicker, some thinner and they are placed differently on the marble.

I prefer to take different pictures in case someone is irritated that it didn't look the same. That way they can't say ""not as pictured/described"". 

Some of my marbles, like the Jabo ones, are more like works of art. In that they don't look at all the same as their brothers and depending on the camera angle look different. So for those I take 4 pics all around the marbles.

Since all the sets are pre-made, numbered and ready to go my shipping time is quick. Fast shipping is something I take pride in and like to be known for.

If you're curious about how I take pics/variety here is my shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheLemonDaisy

The first 2 listings are the Jabos that are different depending on the angle, and the bottom left is the Goldfish which are different depending on the swirls.

"stunfisk","t5_2sn6d","Yay we're on Stunfisk! Hi guys!


As a Smogon Doubles player, here's what happened throughout the voting. Initially, a lot of people were considering to ban. There was quite a bit of discussion and debate in the Mence suspect thread. However over time, many people found that they didn't even know what to think of Mega Mence, even after they got requirements to vote. I believe this was largely due to there being very few Mega Mences in the ladder, which I believe was due to people being scared about extreme counter teaming during suspect period or that they don't want to build a team that could get banned soon. Either way, many people seemed on the fence, and gradually many people started to go anti ban which was why I was very surprised when Mence got banned, though only by a margin (like 1 vote). 

My personal opinion of Mence, I never really had one. I certainly used HP Ice on my Aegislash for a while fearing it, but I wasn't sure whether it was broken or not simply because I never personally fought one and had witness to it's amazing (according to some) set up capabilities. 



The difference between Mence in Smogon Doubles and Mence in VGC and Battle Spot is the 6v6 and 4v4 situation. With 5 other Pokemon you have plenty of opportunities to switch when threatened and you have apt more capabilities of support, not forgetting you have great supporters like Jirachi available in Smog Dubs. For this reasons it can be much harder to set up in a 4v4 situation and is potentially why people prefer Special Mence to physical in said 4v4 situations.","1420071183"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Yes: I am strongly disagreeing with that 'point'. I most strongly disagree that ""a phone meeting with... a dozen other members of the ... team"" is not one of the most efficient ways to quickly track down a one-off bug involving time-zone/date shenanigans that may involve user environment wrinkles that may require the test machine to be quickly reset for another 'clean' pass at the problem.  You get to keep working and tracking down the issue while talking with the team: **this is a hyper-efficient approach to the problem**.

If someone comes into my office for an interview and says that this is not an efficient approach for a hot high-priority issue, I have grave concerns about that person.  Maybe you can provide an alternative better solution for ""each team member working directly on diagnosing and fixing their share of the problem while maintaining an instant line of multiway communication"", but it's still excellent.  And someone having bad meetings at their company doesn't invalidate what was clearly and demonstrably a productive meeting here.

We can get into the meta of it sucking for MTGO to have high priority issues on a regular basis, but from a development and test perspective the response was bang-up and the criticism unfair and unfounded.  Give them a break: software is hard enough without throwing in the crazed rules of Magic into the mix.  Someone from the team quickly posting up ""thanks for catching this - we're working on it""?

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Different types of passes: A square pass is a sideways pass, as opposed to a forward or backward pass. In a similar vein, a long ball is when you hoof the ball a fair distance as opposed to a short pass. 

What you do off the ball depends upon your team's strategy and the opposition's strategy. In the simplest terms, when you do not have the ball you can either attack or defend. 

If you are defending, you will attempt to position yourself so that you may intercept a pass or mark an opponent. In some cases an opponent who is further up the field from your goal will gather pace running towards you, and outrun you to receive a pass behind you (and thereby 'beat you' by 'running in the channels'). You should be alert towards this and run alongside the attacker to intercept the pass (called 'tracking the runner').  You should also watch out for an opponent on the side of field ('wings') who will aerially pass the ball to a forward (this pass is called  a 'cross') so that he may head the ball in. 

If you are attacking, you can be a 'target man': you run into empty space to receive a long pass ahead of all of your teammates, and maintain possession until your teammates move into the attacking third. This is generally done by strikers. If you are a midfielder can run into a channel to receive a pass (generally attacking mids), or act as a passing outlet (the creative mids). If you are a passing outlet, you should ideally position yourself in a space where it is easy for your teammate to pass the ball to you, and for you to pass the ball along. So you will look to form one vertex of a triangle, the other vertices of which are the player with the ball and the player you want to pass to. The more triangles/vertices, the more options you have and the harder it is to defend against. I have heard you can also be a defensive midfielder but I support Arsenal so I don't know what that is (Jk, your job is to defend and regain possession higher up the field to facilitate a fast counterattack, or plug in 'holes' left by your defensive wingers who have advanced to attack). You can be a mix of both defending and attacking midfielder, which is called box-to-box. 

Of course these are the most oversimplified of the simplest answers and there are many more complications in each position and my knowledge is also limited. But this can start you off I guess. ","1420071188"

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","When you fire a mech mod, the voltage being pulled through the coil is different than what the battery voltage is by itself. This is because the metal tube has a resistance, and different metals, along with the threading and atty contact contribute to the resistance of your mech mod. A steel nemesis, which has lots of threading along with non direct contact 510 will have way more voltage drop than a simple copper tube with direct contact to the atomizer. This means that more volts will be pulled through the coil, which also means more power and a higher amp load.

Direct contact simply means that the little 510 threaded thing on the bottom of your atomizer touches the the top of the battery directly when you push the button instead of having it go through some adjustable pin.","1420071188"

I think the most interesting movement happening right now to help the problem is repealing lot size ordinances in conjunction with the tiny home movement. 

Or there's always the Detroit model--economic withdrawal and abandonment.

1. Spider-Man 2: 9/10 - One of the best comic-book movies ever made, from the opening Alex Ross credits I knew I was in for something brilliant. The Raindrops montage is beautiful, train sequence is nail-bitingly great. Wondrous cinematography and lighting.

2. Spider-Man: 7/10 - A bit dated now, but a well-told origin story, and that end fight against the Green Goblin is brutal.

3. The Amazing Spider-Man 2: 6/10 - Overlong, but I like the Garfield/Stone chemistry even if there are too many romantic scenes, Electro was OK, I liked the special effects, actually got a little choked up at Gwen's death.

4. Spider-Man 3: 5/10 - There are elements I love, INCLUDING the dancing Peter scene, gets the ""nerd attempting to be bad"" absolutely spot-on, but Sandman and Venom were seriously shortchanged (though the Birth of Sandman scene and score is suitably haunting and tragic), and MJ is a completely unlikeable bitch in it, especially compared to how likeable and charming Gwen is in the ASM films)

5. The Amazing Spider-Man: ZZZZZZZZZZ/10 - ZZZZZZZZZZZZ. What a boring, flat film. Uncle Ben's death was a non-event. The special effects were awful (I thought they were much better in ASM2), the Lizard was a crap villain, nothing resonated with me emotionally at all, and no action scenes got me excited. That said, I did like the scene of Spider-Man playing on his phone while waiting in his web, that was classic Spidey.","1420071193"

Whichever one you are, it's always the other guy's fault. ""The bike came out of nowhere!"" ""The driver didn't look properly."" I suspect the truth is a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B, and bad fucking luck. I've seen bikes act like dicks, I've seen cars act like dicks, I've seen motorcyclists do stupid shit, I've seen people walk where they shouldn't.

My conclusion, from all this, is: protect yourself. If I walk, I imagine the car will never see me, and never stop; or it might even speed up to run me over for funsies (happened a couple times); unless it's currently stopped and the driver is looking at my eyes. If I drive, I imagine every child will run into the street with no warning, every pedestrian is going to cross without bothering to look, and every drunk college kid will fall over with his/her head under my wheels. And every bike will do the same thing, except faster. Just as I imagine no car sees me, and may merge at any time for no reason, or brake for no reason.

I figure if I'm fragile, the only time I have the right of way is in an ambulance. If I'm not, then the last thing I want to do is deal with running someone over; even if they're enough of an idiot for it to be a capital crime, I don't want to be the executioner.

 &gt;""Beside the entrance, the king’s armor stood sentry; a suit of forest green plate, its fittings chased with gold, the helm crowned by a great rack of golden antlers. The steel was polished to such a high sheen that she could see her reflection in the breastplate, gazing back at her as if from the bottom of a deep green pond. The face of a drowned woman, Catelyn thought. Can you drown in grief? She turned away sharply, angry with her own frailty.""

   Also amazing because it's one of a few allusions in Cat's chapters to Sylvia Plath.   Sylvia's ""Mirror"" poem, which GRRM paralleled with Cat seeing her own reflection in Renly's breastplate:  

&gt;""Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,/
Searching my reaches for what she really is./
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon./
I see her back, and reflect it faithfully./
She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands./
I am important to her. She comes and goes./

For example, when I first started dating my boyfriend, his mom got into an accident and he was really worried about her. I was also worried about her since my boyfriend seemed so distressed about it. But for some reason, after I was really drunk one night, I told him that I didn't believe that she was really that hurt and he ended up having to convince me by showing me a picture of her in the hospital.

The next morning, when he told me what I said, I was mortified! There was never a point when I doubted that his mom was hurt!! **I am so happy he told me I said that though so I could profusely apologize.**

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","1 is pretty much irrelevant if it is wrong to kill animals for farming purposes. Maybe keeping them for non-meat products and only eating them when they die naturally but somehow still healthy enough to eat would be defensible there.

2 doesn't deal with what I understand the normal objections to be (that animals of a certain capacity should not be killed) and vegetarians also seem the sort to push for more conscientious farming in general. I don't think that a few billion ants even collectively deserve the respect of larger and smarter animals in vegetarians eyes.


3 is countered by the fact that non-existence is argued to be superior to many forms of existence. Lives full of pain, torture and distress are not held to be worth living.

This goes for gas water heaters, stoves, ovens, driers, etc. Check and see if everything is electric or gas. You'll be spending a lot less overall with gas, so that's just something to keep in mind, maybe when looking at your next house. 

Another thing you can do is switch out any incandescent lightbulbs for either CFL or LED bulbs, both of which can help reduce energy usage. And obviously keeping lights and other appliances off if you don't need them can make a big impact. 

Timers can help too, especially on the thermostat, if you don't already have one. Have the heat turn on in the morning before you wake up, shut off once everyone leaves the house, go back on when you get home and turn down during the night. That's much more efficient than just running it all day/when home. ","1420071202"

"minnesotavikings","t5_2qocl","Obviously all of the prospects you mentioned are great and I think you are asking who are some other guys we could look at in later rounds?

**Round 3 Possibility - Sammie Coates, WR, Auburn**
Coates is a player out of the same mold of Randy Moss (not saying he is a Randy Moss), but he does that great combo of size and speed. His issue seems to come down to technical parts of being a reciever. He is a good deep-threat, but I dont necessarily want us to get our hands on another player like CP84 who struggles with routes. Watch for how he does tomorrow against Wisconsin without Auburns other best receiver out for the game.

**Round 2 Possibility - Jalen Strong - WR - ASU**

Personally one of my favorites, Strong put together a fantastic season with the Sun Devils. Strong has great size speed and strength especially for a receiver. He also impressed me with his run blocking skills as I watched tape. Strong is a decent route runner, ASU does run a spread offense for the most part which really limited his route tree during his college tender.

**5th Round Possibilty - Tony Lippet - WR - Michigan St.**

Admittedly, I have not watched enough tape on Lippett, but he does look like a good prospect. Watch him in his bowl game tomorrow.","1420071205"

&gt;__Biltmore Estate__ is a large private estate and tourist attraction in [Asheville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asheville,_North_Carolina), [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina). Biltmore House, the main house on the estate, is a [Châteauesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teauesque)-styled mansion built by [George Washington Vanderbilt II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Vanderbilt_II) between 1889 and 1895 and is the [largest privately owned house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_houses_in_the_United_States) in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), at 178,926 square feet (16,622.8 m^2)  of floor space (135,280 square feet (12,568 m^2) of living area). Still owned by one of [Vanderbilt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_family) descendants, it stands today as one of the most prominent remaining examples of the [Gilded Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age). In 2007, it was ranked eighth in *[America's Favorite Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Favorite_Architecture)* by the [American Institute of Architects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Architects).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ooo, I have a story that happened two days ago.

I work at a CVS, so I'll have customers that come back wanting to return an item. No big deal, it's a simple task. As long as you have the receipt and the item with you I can make a return. If you don't have the receipt I can give you store credit. Pretty standard right?

It's about 40 minutes into my shift and there's been a steady flow of people, so so far an average day. I'm standing there waiting for the next customer to come in when I hear the doors open so I get ready to greet the customer. In comes this woman that all of the other employees have dealt with at least once, except for me. 'Oh boy, it's my turn' I thought to myself. I greet her and she comes up to my register and slaps down three receipts and starts asking for a price adjustment on 9 items and the asks about the battery promotion we were running the week before. I tell her that the batteries weren't BOGO free but that they were half off. So she steps away to look for the sign and I call my manager up for some back up for the lines. When the customer comes back I explain to her that there isn't anything I can do about the batteries since it clearly says on the receipt ""All batteries BOGO half off"". She starts asking about the items that are actually Christmas clearance items that she bought THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER. My manager steps in and explains there's nothing we can do, which set her into full on rage mode. ""I WAS TOLD I COULD GET AN ADJUSTMENT ON THESE ITEMS. WAS I LIED TO? WHY CAN'T YOU DO THIS!"" Finally she calms down slightly and asks if she can still return the items since she has the receipts. My manager explains that as long as you have the receipts we can make a full return otherwise you'll just get store credit for what the item is priced currently. She doesn't understand. They go back and forth until finally she turns back to me and asks if I understand what my manager is saying. ""Yes, as long as you have the receipt and the item with you we can make a full return."" ""Oh, you mean I have to have the item with me? No one ever said that!"" ""Because it's common knowledge ma'am"". She screams at us some more and then leaves.

Moral of the story? You must have the receipt and the item with you to make a return. Also, don't be a fucking asshole because I could have done something for her.","1420071209"

O unico problema ""grande"" da cidade é o transporte e a mobilidade em horarios de pico, mas se você morar no centro não tem problema em geral, sendo paciente você consegue chegar com o transporte publico em torno de 30min - 1hr em qualquer lugar da ilha. Moro no norte da ilha e minha vida é bem calma,18 anos e nunca fui assaltado. Aqui normalmente as pessoas gostam de ir na praia e em shoppings. As praias são muito bonitas! Não vejo problema em gringos trabalharem aqui, mas não posso falar muito pois não conheço. Não descriminamos o pessoal que vem de fora (talvez só uns argentinos no verão, hahaha)

É um bom lugar pra se viver se você quer mais natureza e menos criminalidade, sem comparação com São Paulo. Aqui temos nossos problemas, mas comparados à metrópole gigante que é São Paulo, quase nada. A ilha é bem pacífica em geral e agradável de viver. 

Passagem de onibus: R$ 2,75 (sem cartão, em dinheiro.)

**TL;DR in english:** Florianópolis is a nice place to live. It's peaceful and beautiful. Our biggest problem is the mobility in general, but i don't think it's worse than SP. I don't know about foreigners working here, but you shouldn't have any problem. Way less dangerous than São Paulo, but it's always nice to be careful anywhere. I don't have a lot of money too, but i live with no problems here. You should try to visit Florianópolis after the Carnival when the city starts to work again and see if you like it!

"acting","t5_2qyft","Tonsof exercizes i can boil down into two basic speaking approaches. Structure of how your mug looks when you speak certain tones and the sound of reserved staccatos and lively stresses on melodic m's and other consonants. Vowels have a shape. Consonants a sound.

Start out by picking a sentence which you think incorporates all which your training requires. Much like the fox sentence with typing. Seeing that im the one doling out free info and with prior teaching exp. i will do my best to provide you with a dramatically written action statement directly relatable to any script today. What makes it actionized is the action words themeslves and the use of forward direct keywords rather than saying ill do it later one might say im planning on doing it later. Planning being the keyword compared to will. Some thing is happening even if later but the character is reacting in a way that demands a reaction. A keyword demands a keypoint and even a keyscene changing moment to leave or inteoduce a new or different character. So just say that sentence. Are you really lazy so as to put ot off for just not wanting to do it or are you good on your word? Its not that its a longer sentence though. Here is a short actionized sentence. Fuck her.  And see what i mean if a schizo can only give you one word unmeaningless answers that will only be required for a schizo lol.

Btw thanks for reminding me of this. Ive always known myself to have the absolute best advice for other people and only rarely for myself. And ill always feel successful if only for even considering myself an actor.Even the occasional local one inbetween my golf rounds as a retiree reflective of the live ive hopefully will afford myself for just being me.

There is a gun shop in a tiny town called Eureka. The owner of this shop shoots tens of thousands of rounds a year. An avid shooter to say the least. This was his advice when asked about barrel break in. 

""Just shoot the damn thing. Shoot it the way you want to be shooting it. If you clean it out after every shot, or every 5 shots you'll eventually train your weapon to shoot well under those and only those conditions.""

Congrats on your new firearm. Remember anything you read online should be taken with a grain of salt until the source has proven itself a worthy one. (My comment included). 

Check out the Podcast called ""Precision Rifle Podcast"". I've really enjoyed it. 

Also, one of my favorite upgrades I have on my Rem 700 is the bolt on bolt knob from KRG. It's around $40 and is awesome.

"TCU","t5_2rg8z","Hey, I was just looking through this sub and figured I would add my voice.

I am a few years out (class of 2009), and attending TCU was one of the best decisions of my life.  I was accepted and went on a college tour with my dad to visit all of my options, and once I stepped on campus I knew I was in love.  Keep in mind that I went to TCU before the stadium and before massive renovation, so you will be the beneficiary of all that cool stuff, but it was still beautiful back then.

I met my wife at TCU and we are both diehard Frog fans so I will always be grateful to the school for making that connection.  The school has a great reputation, and I rarely go out in California without someone commenting on any TCU apparel I may be wearing.  Following school, I got my masters and now am about to finish my doctorate in clinical psychology, so know that you will also have a wide world of graduate opportunities to build on your great TCU degree if you so choose.

Anyway, I would go to TCU all over again if I could, and I cannot recommend it enough.  I recommend that you listen to your heart/gut when you visit schools, because that is what sealed the deal for me.  I knew deep down that I was meant to be a Frog after I visited, so just pay attention to what you feel about it when you visit.  Go Frogs!","1420071223"

"VictoriaBC","t5_2rbsy","I've found that they only become a problem if there's a large reservoir of paper in contact with the floor -- I've always seen them around occasionally (maybe 3 sightings/week) and usually they don't seem interested in going after food.

Then at one point earlier this year there were suddenly a lot more of them, and they infested a bag of sugar, and some other things in a cupboard. Was confused, as they'd never done that before. Went on a house cleaning binge, and found a collection of old egg cartons my ex had left behind, and they were using that as a breeding ground. Got rid of the egg cartons, numbers went back down to normal within a day and they all voluntarily abandoned the food cupboard.

They *love* that rough pressed recycled paper stuff that egg cartons are made of, so that's something to be aware of (e.g. some items like big screen TVs, computers, etc. use pressed paper instead of styrofoam -- it's a good idea to get rid of that if you don't need it).

If you have too many of these, don't hit them with bug sprays, etc. (because that can mess up your spider population, which can then in turn lead to ant problems); just find out where they're managing to find the resources to breed and get rid of their base of operations.","1420071226"

That quote is completely irrelevant to what we're discussing. [Here's Washington's full letter](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-10-02-0415). The letter is an order to a colonel, discussing the logistics of troop movements. Of course details of troop movements in wartime should be closely guarded, but that's not at all what we're discussing, and I'm surprised you thought this would be a good quote to bring up here. Did you simply see a quote by George Washington and think it must apply to politics because he later served as President?

What we're talking about is whether the public should be left completely in the dark about important questions of national policy. Should the President be able to go to war without the public knowing? Should the President be able to arrogate himself vast powers of surveillance without any public discussion? Should the President be required to show convincing evidence to the public when claiming the US is under attack, or faces some sort of grave danger, or should everyone just trust the President's word? Should the public know what rebel groups in what countries the US government is funding or arming? If the US is funding fascist militias in Nicaragua, does the American public have a right to know? If you believe the government's actions should reflect the will of the public, then the answer is obvious. The primary reason for secrecy in such cases is that the actions are either illegal or unpopular. If you think those are sufficient justifications for secrecy, either you don't believe in the rule of law or you don't believe in democracy.","1420071230"

Stats: female, 5'9 around 135 or 140. When I started I was 140 and after a while looked so much leaner I was sure I dropped like 10 pounds.

My blood sugar is so greatly stabilized, I had terrible issues before. My skin...I can't even describe how happy I am, I could cry. Battled acne for YEARS...I've felt ugly my whole life. To the point id sit at home and sob and feel too hideous to go out. I'd go to work because I had to and just be utterly miserable. Now I have consistently clear, glowing dewy skin.

I don't even know what MFA is but I like to think I'm a maverick :) Oh wait masters...f..ic...never mind. 


Also, I think you're grossly mischaracterizing most here. They are by policy **FORCED** to critique and often this pushes them well out of their comfort zone prematurely and we need to recognize that and still embrace it. 


It's like demanding someone become a tutor before they can be tutored. It's ass backwards in that reguard, but we stand by it and we think it's working (and we do reevaluate from time to time as things change or I come up with ideas or the community presents them). 

Again, we've discussed the possiblity of /r/SuperDestructiveReaders actually the idea came to me when we were ...not advertising but setting up the erotica thing with uhh eroticaauthor4 their mod. /r/smutwriters came up, a very small sub that is almost identical. The difference is, I don't think we'd be able to survive / thrive based just on critiques. Those dudes take it as a community from what I understand and keep it very private to themselves.

Humans cannot normally see more than our color spectrum because we do not have photoreceptors that detect UV or IR light.

In this scenarion, from my understanding, he just decides whether or not to sign a document agreeing to be financially responsible for the child, *but* if he decides he doesn't want to father the child, he doesn't have to ANYTHING, while it's all up to the woman to both get the abortion AND pay for it, if she can manage to do so.

"PennStateUniversity","t5_2rgmf","Yes. A bunch of us.

There is **Canoe Club of Centre County** and **Moshannon Creekers**. 

CCofCC is a nonprofit group dedicated to both rec and whitewater paddling. Membership gives you access to the listserv, paddling courses in spring/summer/fall, and discounts at local outfitters. [Link to FB page.](https://www.facebook.com/CanoeClubofCentreCounty)

Mo Creekers is the most active group in the area. It's a loosely affiliated group of about 170 ""members"" ranging in skill from total beginner to class V boaters. This is NOT an official club, just an online group to organize trips, swap gear, etc. The Facebook group is ""secret"", so you'll have to DM me for instructions on how to join.

CCofCC and MoCreekers are co-running pool sessions on the first Sunday of each month through April or May (the next session is this Sunday from 4-6pm at the Burnham YMCA). Cost is variable ($10 per session to $35 per season). Note: these are not lessons per se as there will be no instructor present, but there is usually someone there willing to work with you.

If you get this tonight, there is a group going out on the Little Juniata on New Year's Day at 10am and maybe another group meeting up at Sunnyside paddle park in bellefonte at 2pm. Make sure you have warm gear (drysuit highly recommended). [Details.](https://www.facebook.com/events/328679317319586/)

(As of now, there are no groups on campus that do any paddling really. PSOC used to be THE paddling group in the northeast/mid-Atlantic, but that was years ago. Presently, it's a bit of a clusterfuck when it comes to trying to get paddle trips and pool sessions organized through them, so they rarely happen. I'm optimistic that maybe working with Penn State Adventure Rec. this spring might be more successful as they have some good people running the show there.)","1420071234"

Tyson and ali wouldn't be able to control that. 

That being said, Tyson vs joe is a bad match up and woody didn't know what he was talking about. 

Another thing is, the octagon is incredibly hide compared to boxing ring. Joe may be able to actually do something against Tyson. Heck, Joe could pull guard, and make Tyson come to him. 

Tyson vs mma fighter closer to his weight class, Tyson loses.

I honestly wouldn't even mind if it got up to 8 teams. I don't think it would be a big issue to have the top 2 teams get a bye. The other 4 can play the first two bowl games of the season, kicking off the bowl games. Then the next playoff games can take place at the same time as they do now. That would give teams 3-6 a long break between games, and it would still cause teams to play hard for one of those top 2 seeds and a bye.

&gt;Religion in Nigeria (2014)

&gt;[Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria) is a society with [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity), [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam) and [Traditional African religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_African_religion) being professed. According to recent estimates [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) is practiced by 50.5% of the population. (19.9% [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism), 12.3% [Churches of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_of_Christ), 10.1% [Anglicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism) and 8.2% [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism)). Islam is the second greatest religion by 43.5% consisting of 95% Sunni Islam and 5% Shia Islam. 6% of the Nigerian people practices [Traditional African religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_African_religion).  

&gt;From the 1990s to the 2000s, there was significant growth in [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism) churches, including the [Redeemed Christian Church of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redeemed_Christian_Church_of_God), [Winners' Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winners%27_Chapel), [Christ Apostolic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Apostolic_Church) (the first Aladura Movement in Nigeria), [Deeper Christian Life Ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deeper_Christian_Life_Ministry), [Evangelical Church of West Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Church_of_West_Africa), [Mountain of Fire and Miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_of_Fire_and_Miracles), Christ Embassy, The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_in_Nigeria), the [Aladura Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladura_Church) (indigenous Christian churches being especially strong in the Yoruba and Igbo areas), and of [evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism) churches in general. These churches have spilled over into adjacent and southern areas of the middle belt. Denominations like the [Seventh-day Adventist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church_in_Nigeria) and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have also flourished.  

&gt;Other leading Protestant churches in the country are the [Church of Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Nigeria) of the [Anglican Communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Communion), the [Assemblies of God Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Council_of_the_Assemblies_of_God_Nigeria), the [Nigerian Baptist Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Baptist_Convention) and [The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.B._Joshua). The Yoruba area contains a large Anglican population, while [Igboland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igboland) is predominantly Catholic and the [Edo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo) area is predominantly Assemblies of God, which was introduced into Nigeria by Augustus Ehurie Wogu and his associates at Old

&gt;[Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam) dominated the north and had a number of supporters in the South Western, [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people) part of the country. Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of Nigeria's major ethnic groups' religious affiliations, the [Hausa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_people) ethnic group in the North is 95% Muslims and 5% Christians, the West which is the [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people) tribe is 35% Christians and 55% Muslim with 10% going to adherents of other African religions, while the [Igbos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbos) of the East and the [Ijaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijaw_people) in the South are 98% Christians (Catholics) and 2% practitioners of traditional religions.  The [middle belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Belt) of Nigeria contains the largest number of minority ethnic groups in Nigeria and they are mostly Christians and members of traditional religions with few Muslim converts.  

&gt;The vast majority of [Muslims in Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Nigeria) are [Sunni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam), belonging to [Maliki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maliki) school of [jurisprudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence); however, a sizeable minority also belongs to [Shafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi) [madhhab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab). A large number of [Sunni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni) [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim) are members of [Sufi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi) brotherhoods. Most Sufis follow the [Qadiriyya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadiriyya), [Tijaniyyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijaniyyah) and/or [Mouride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouride) movement. A significant [Shia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia) minority exists (*see [Shia in Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_in_Nigeria)*). Some northern states have incorporated [Sharia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia) law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy.  [Kano State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_State) has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution.  The majority of [Quranists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quranist) follow the Kalo Kato or Quraniyyun movement. There are also [Ahmadiyya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya) and Mahdiyya minorities. 

&gt;According to a 2001 report  from *[The World Factbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook)* by [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA), about 50% of Nigeria's population is [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim), 40% are [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians) and 10% adhere to local religions.  But in some recent report, the Christian population is now sightly larger than the Muslim population. An 18 December 2012 report on religion and public life by the [Pew Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center) stated that in 2010, 49.3 percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8 percent was Muslim, and 1.9 percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated.  Additionally, the 2010s census of [Association of Religion Data Archives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Religion_Data_Archives) has reported that 46.5 percent of the total population is Christian, slightly bigger than the Muslim population of 45.5 percent, and that 7.7 percent are members of other religious groups.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","I usually don't trust Yahoo Answers very often but I thought this was kind of an interesting comment on the topic (says he works in the wine industry, take with a grain of salt):

&gt; The average liver filters alcohol out of the bloodstream at the rate of 15mg/hour. Since an average drink (in North America) has about 18mg of alcohol in it, you need to figure that the drinks are going to be eliminated at a rate of about a drink every 75 minutes. 

&gt; Start counting from 30 minutes after you started drinking (when that first drink would have reached your bloodstream) and eliminate one drink for every 75 minutes after that point. So 24 hours would be enough time to eliminate about 18 drinks from your system. 

&gt; https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20091023122803AAzPpZQ


Going by that, assume you start drinking at 8:30PM (start counting at 9PM), and drink 12 beers.  You stop drinking at 1AM, go to bed, and wake up at 9AM.

18mg*12 = 216mg consumed

9PM-9AM = 12 hours * 15mg = 180mg filtered

So, at least going by those numbers, by the time you wake up you have 2 beers worth of alcohol (36mg) left in your system.  Honestly that sounds about right for a ""normal"" person with a mild (or no) hangover after a night of moderate drinking.  Increase it to 16 beers with the same timeframes and you wake up with 6 beers worth of alcohol in your system.

Justamente lo que dije, encima dice 

&gt; Looking at the global data, it appeared that men are most vulnerable. 80% of victims are men and most perpetrators are also men. Particularly in the Americas, but overall as well, and varying across regions, it is mostly men that are killed. Why then discuss femicide? The great majority of women are killed in the domestic context and this is not an issue of a specific country/region.

"SoccerBetting","t5_2r4wz","One thing to note about the Soton - Arsenal game is that both Schneiderlin is out suspended, so there is their defensive cover gone. On top of that, Clyne is out injured, so they will have to shift their back four a bit. Given that their normal RB is out injured, that will leave them horribly exposed on the left.

As I said in the game against West Ham, that causes a hell of a lot of problems, in that Sanchez and Cazorla both drift around the left and will cause havoc there. 

That said, the only issue with taking the Gunners is that Welbeck is doubtful for the game, which means Sanchez will be up front, unless the Gunners switch their formation to a 4-3-3, with a fluid top 3. 

I personally would put this at a X2 or Arsenal DNB, both teams would be happy with a point, but the Gunners are more likely to take all 3. ","1420071237"

This also eliminates the problem of a potential race condition where a new transaction was inserted in between when the last transaction was queried, and then a new transaction was saved. A trigger would automatically make sure that the new balance is calculated at save time. Of course you could take out a table lock if you wanted to, but a trigger saves you from having to do that.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","I played KoT several times before KoNY was released and always enjoyed it, which is why I purchased KoNY. My groups found KoNY easy to learn, but for the most part we are experienced gamers and already knew the rules to KoT. I still enjoy KoT, but it somehow feels flat after having played KoNY.

For me, the key difference isn't that there are more meaningful decisions in KoNY; both games are light and heavily luck-based. It is how much more thematic KoNY feels. In KoT, it is truly a game of king-of-the-hill. One monster stands in Tokyo and fends off the other monsters, who are presumably sitting out in the ocean somewhere. Tokyo itself is nothing more than an oversized marker that says ""I'm it - come and get me!"" And with the exception of claws, the results of the dice rolls aren't very exciting, particularly the 1's/2's/3's for victory points.

In KoNY, every monster is in one of the boroughs of New York, terrorizing the bridge-and-tunnel people but really wanting to climb the Empire State Building and swat airplanes down on Wall Street. The numbers on the dice are replaced by symbols that let you destroy buildings and the militia that come to defend the city and by symbols that trigger the militia to attack you and possibly other monsters. You can gain celebrity and even become the defender of the city (think Godzilla vs Mothra), with the Statue of Liberty fighting by your side! It simply feels more like you are playing out a 50's Japanese Monster flick.","1420071243"

OP has changed a lot physically, but she is still the same person, her personality is the same.

I understand that looks are important when it comes to dating, but I'm having trouble with the fact that I so easily dismiss someone as ""unworthy"" based solely on their appearance. I try not to, but it happens, I'm sure it's happened to me as well.

"Frozen","t5_2vpth","Well, not with her powers no, although she knocked out the villain that was owning everyone with a blast of Ice Magic, but nothing else. However she did save the Protagonist who had a crisis much like hers. The protagonist, Emma, lost the control of her powers and was about to give them up (which would have killed her and let one of the bad guys win, although nobody knew that), the only one who could find her was Elsa; Elsa showed real character explaining to her that even if her true love (the protagonist son) couldn't help her like Anna to Elsa it was also on her and not only relying on others, and well it was really a great window into Elsa's feelings during the thaw and how she confronted herself as well as her character evolution. In the end they touched hands and the light that happens when true love breaks a curse shined tough ._. which had really weird lesbian undertones given they aren't sisters or anything haha.  And Emma got to control her powers and walking away from the trap along with Elsa.

I really loved that scene and was one of the best in the show, because it was the first time true love and other person wasn't exactly the ultimate answer, it was more of trusting oneself and understanding the capacity of one as an individual, and the fact that the lesson/saving came from Elsa was even better.

I don't know about Mr. Freeze tough, he is being defeated pretty pathetically at times. I really doubt she could deal with the things evil Elsa was doing on the deleted scenes haha, but it's still something we can't see now. Elsa can indeed create a lot of energy, I keep wondering what would happen with her snowmen if she died tough, perhaps they would die as well.

And I see, I used to dislike fire before, because most protagonist on series usually use fire which became tiring and boring, but as time went by I started liking all the elements in different ways because of the chars I've created, I made a second mmm warrior of Fire that's a girl and ended up putting really cool stuff in her arsenal, so ended up loving it haha. Not as much as cold or electricity tough. And yeah Crystallization is pretty cool. It all depends on how one limits things tough, some consider metal to be part of earth, others thing water and cold are the same, etc... so it's a very personal matter in the end.","1420071248"

Her great great (probably another two greats in there) grandmother was in the Wild West (Nebraska, if memory serves correctly), and she ended up getting a visit from some cowboys on horseback. She hid her kids in the barn, as this was usually never a good sign. They all had guns and had her make them a meal, and as they began to dig in, she said that she was Mennonite, and they had to say grace. So they take off their hats and hear the prayer, and she wishes them good health, etc, etc. They stay the night, have breakfast with another prayer, and the next day they leave. 

As they're leaving, one of them says, ""Do you know who I am?""

She says no, and he says that he's Jesse James. She thinks, well shit, he's gonna kill me.

He tells her that no one has ever said grace or prayer for them, and that no one has ever wished him good health, etc etc, and he lets her live. ","1420071249"

It was basically the 2 at the end that was throwing me off a bit but once I tinkered with it and tried replacing two with 1,3,4 I quickly realized that my assumption was right - it just replaces whatever instance you specify (from left to right) with nothing.

I did just realize an issue with this, though.  Sorry - I forgot to specify this in my original post.  The instances where  model (dell, 24-inch) will be few and far between.  Most of the time the data will be 'valid' with no extra commas.  In those situations this particular command will strip out the valid second comma and make that particular line invalid.  Any way to protect against this?  Again, only occasional instances will we see things like  model (dell, 24-inch), we could easily see something like 

    John Doe, 24"" dell monitor, 12345678, 1 infinity loop

That's why I did like the idea of this solution.  

    sed 's/\(\""\)\(.*\)\(,\)\(.*\)\(\""\)/\2\4/'

I just couldn't figure out how to get it search for parenthesis instead of double quotes.  It would be nice for sed to just search for parenthesis since we always know that if there is a comma in the parenthesis, it's unwanted, and to go ahead and remove it.

I'm not sure why the other commenters are so convinced she's undeserving of making the list. She has the most influential position at the fed which is one of, if not, the most influential central bank in the world. The fact of the matter is that she plays a crucial role in shaping fed policy. 

Also worth noting: Christine Lagarde is omitted from the list as well. You'd think that given what's been going on in Europe that the head of the IMF might be considered pretty influential too. ","1420071250"

* Buggy/Unfinished games will be on a steep decline after public outcry, although a few infamous companies may continue to do so.

* Steam improves support, Valve implements source 2 making the way for a Left 4 Dead 3 release.

* Battlefield Hardline will surprise people, Witcher 3 will shock people and Metal Gear Solid will have a bigger community after MGSV's release.

* Black Desert will breathe some life into the MMO community.

* With DX12 and MS focus on PC gaming, PC gaming leads the charge bringing more console exclusive games to PC. Consoles will get some PC games as well.

* MOBA's dominate the year once more with an even bigger communities

* Online only games will decrease after the issues plaguing 2014.

* Game releases are great in 2015 with the exception of a few of course, but much better than 2014. 

* Indie games will be seen as good as AAA games later down the year due to the number of great releases. 

* VR will have a fantastic year with the Rift having a CR1 release.

* Micro-transactions in fully priced games will slowly go away after public outcry gives those games bad coverage.

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","Thanks for the actual context because it makes more sense (to me) in light of what he says right before and after. My one concern though, and maybe someone can clear this up, is that in the first part of the Intercept interview he says that Adnan told him he killed Hae. 

From the first part of the [interview](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/12/29/exclusive-interview-jay-wilds-star-witness-adnan-syed-serial-case-pt-1/):
&gt; So I go to pick him up, and when I get there he says, ‘Oh shit, I did it.’ I say, ‘Did what?’ He says, ‘I killed Hae.’

The next question is about the trunk pop (assuming the interview is transcribed in the sequence it occurred), which then makes the whole ""doesn't involve me"" statement a little weirder in my eyes. Again as others have stated its hard to get a read since none of us know Jay and how he speaks normally so we really don't have a true baseline to judge his statements by. Curious what you all make of it, if anything.

That said, I think Cisco is on the right track with their response. Enterprise network operators should be able to protect their network by deauth-ing malicious AP's, but I think this should be limited to cases where the AP in question is impersonating an existing SID, or clearly attempting to mislead users (e.g. broadcasting a ""Company X Wifi"" SSID). Using that approach against non-malicious devices like personal hotspots is a different beast. Since wifi spectrum is unlicensed and hotspot users have a right to use it that's equal with the hotel's, I don't think that should be permitted.","1420071256"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It's easier to start with diet. Just eat *a lot* less if you're anywhere close to 400 lbs.  Eat ""normal"" for a couple days and count every calorie.  Then try cutting that by 30%.  If you get hungry instead of eating a whole bag of chips just eat a few and see if you are satisfied.  When eating dinner only serve yourself a bit of everything and see how you feel.  If you eat out try only eating 1/2 of what you're served and take the rest home for another meal.  Remember feeling a little hungry isn't going to kill you.  And stuffing yourself is what you're trying to avoid ... you should never feel sick after eating.

Do that for a month and you're going to lose weight.  Then once you have that under control try eating better.  Only drink water and maybe milk and coffee (if that's your thing).  No soda, no juice, no beer (sorry).  Instead of eating chips eat nuts.  Instead of eating cookies eat carrots.  Etc.

Once you're eating better then start exercising.  You could start walking at any point but at some point you'll want to pick it up a little bit.  You don't have to go to the gym, just do some push ups and squats and things like that.  If you're heavy that's going to be a big workout already.

"feminineboys","t5_2vmuo","Two-oh-fourteen wasn't that amazing for me.
 I lost a hefty amount of weight and I'm kind of slowly moving into the unhealthy zone of underweight. I'm not that fit and at the beginning of the year I was at 180lbs, whilst right now I'm below 130 (I'm 6 feet tall). That didn't help cure or even lessen my body dysmorphia and social anxiety, though. At all. It literally just got worse. I'm trying to keep the stupid thoughts  incheck but it's all so overwhelming. Owerwhelmingly stupid. I'm only 16 so I know that most of this is just teenage hormonal issues speaking. The issues are still very real to me, and that just makes it worse. 

While we're on the topic of hormnes, this was also the year in which I figured out that 'transgenderism' is indeed a real thing, and that, OF-FUCKING-COURSE, triggered gender dysphoria more intense than any I've ever felt before. A year ago, the most I ever felt was a miniscule sadness. I also frequently fantasised about becoming/being a girl but those were the only things that ever occured.. Simple fantasies, with no basis in real life and (mostly) no effect on it. 

Now, however.. I barely go out, I despair pretty much all the time and I absolutely LOATHE looking in mirrors. When I do, I feel like breaking both the mirror and my face. So yeah.. '14 wasn't good. I also live in a homophobic/transphobic country, so that really helps keep emotions at bay.

I'm really sorry for the sob story. I just had to vent my thoughts.

Here's hoping for a more progressive and happier year for everyone. ","1420071257"

The company really wanted us to pick them up and we had a flight coming back in that said there were enough holes we could cancel enroute and make it in VFR, so they ended up filing us to a nearby airport with an approach where we would cancel halfway.

We ended up in solid IMC the entire time and there was 0 chance of getting in VFR, and without an approach it wasn't possible to land. We ended up telling center we were called to return by company and they seemed pretty peeved. Even so, we got turned around and cleared basically direct back.

What would your thoughts on that have been? The captain and I didn't want to do the flight in the first place but the report from our other plane made it seem like it would work.

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","Seeing as alcohol tends to be a lot of sugar, making sure he keeps an eye on his bloodsugars so they're not going too high. Since it's ""partying drinking"" and not ""a beer with dinner drinking"", it's going to be hard to even roughly guestimate what his sugar intake is going to be through the night. Unless someone has a good suggestion (which I would like to hear, too), he's going to have to take a reaction-based approach to insulin intake, possibly not taking a proper / final correction until the night is done. If the likelihood is that you're going to get pass-out-drunk, it's best to play it cautious with the insulin intake. Having the usual sugar tablets along is a smart move. You shouldn't have to babysit him, just be aware that on top of any hangover he's likely to be feeling the effects a high bloodsugar as well.","1420071261"

"CoDCompetitive","t5_2tvg8","I'm Rory. I'm 24 and I live in North Devon, England. I live with my fiancee and our cat, Ji. (Ji-sung Park is my favourite ever Manchester United player).

I work for a menswear company - sell suits etc. It's more fun than it sounds. I love music - notably death metal, hardcore and black metal. I support Manchester United and I also love the Dallas Cowboys. 

My first ever CoD was World at War and I was absolutely terrible at it. I became a fan of competitive towards the end of Black Ops 2 and found out about the scene by stumbling across a Scumpii video while we were on holiday in Chicago last September. I'd love to try my hand at competitive but the truth is I'm not good enough, ha. 

If anybody ever fancies a few games of Advanced Warfare, Madden, FIFA, NBA 2K15 or WWE 2K15 on the XB1 then add me: xDODGEMATEx.

Secondly, once the water has evaporated and formed into clouds, there has to be some change for the water to precipitate (fall as rain, snow...). The most common causes of this is changes in air pressure/tempurature more water vapor being added to the air. These changes are not common in the desert.

It's true it would have been a hard thing to police, but the Romans were especially paranoid at Passover, and a if group that had already caused trouble at the Temple was caught walking around with swords, they would easily see that as dangerous and act accordingly.

He contacted Origin Support, they reversed the transactions, and he canceled the transactions on his card via his bank. At some point, EA decided to charge the card anyway. Seeing as how he had already blocked the transactions from happening, they banned his account. And now they are basically telling him to go fuck himself, that he tried to defraud them. Its fucking insanity.

Guy is one of the best players I know, and has been a long time Battlefield veteran, and all his shit is locked down. Cant even access his battlelog. Its just dumb. So dumb.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","She's right when she says ""no warning shots"". You don't point a gun at anyone unless you're going to pull the trigger and once you do you pull it until no more bullets come out. 

Proper gun handling aside, that fucker got what he deserved. 

Edit: I've read a lot of positive feedback and some fair criticisms. To be clear, shooting someone who's down when there is no immediate threat to your or your family's life is murder. And if you can retreat safely you should always do so. The goal is deescalation and avoiding violence. 

However I've seen far too many people who continue to say this woman had no justification to shoot her stalker who was in the process of breaking into her house. While they're a minority, they're a loud one. To them: do you people have any empathy that you could imagine what it would be like to be her in that moment after months of carrying a gun everywhere she went out of fear because of constant harassment and threats? 

A couple of these people are regular members of women-hating subs and I wonder if their views on women may have something to do with their ability to empathize more with a man who was likely going to rape and kill than with the woman he targeted as his victim. 

Always take your friends seriously if any of them come to you and say they've been hurt, stalked, or threatened by someone else. Put yourself in his or her shoes and offer what you can as far as support and safety. Even if you don't have proof that something happened, you can't go wrong by offering support and safety just in case. ","1420071271"

""Guide"" is just code to get around eBay ToS.  It doesn't work though, eBay will still ban you once they catch wind.  It takes them a while to notice though even if you flat out say ""hey check out my virtual items!"".  It's probably technically against Nintendo's ToS too but there's no way for them to check.  There's nothing ""illegal"" about it though, just against ToS.  Worst that happens is you get your eBay account banned, usually just temporarily.

Yes they're duped, but they pass legality checkers.  With a good seller you can't tell it's duped/powersaved.  I've mentioned this before in other threads but there's literally no difference between a ""legit"" poke and a powersaved one.

Most buyers aren't reddit savvy super players.  They're just people who don't want to spend hours SR legendaries or parents who want a surprise for their kids.

"AdvancedRunning","t5_2t1rd","Pretty miserable week. Ended up getting strep around Christmas so aside from a lousy sick/feverish 4.5 on Christmas Eve, I was out of commission for the latter half of last week. And so I fell a bit short of 2500 miles

1. 2476.9 miles for the year. Definitely would've hit 2500 if I hadn't gotten sick...or run more earlier in the year.

2. Didn't race much aside from marathons. PR'd in Vegas with a 3:21, but I can be faster.

3. I wanted to get back into running after some years of sporadic running. I figured that the best way to do that was to get some consistency, so I set out to run on 250 days. I did 318.

4. There was the incredulous stupidity at Vegas (1:31 half! stupid, stupid me) and the awesome feeling at a local 5k on July 4th where I finally felt like I could race again.

5. Not a single one stands out too much; there were some awesome early morning tempo runs, but not a single one that I look back at with a marker of acclaim. Actually, I take that back. While on vacation in SF, there was a fantastic long run/hill run from the place I was staying in the Castro across the Golden Gate bridge and up to Battery point.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Well done OP.

The phenomenon you are observing is called the Hegelian dialectic.

Hegel was a German philosopher who described the method and ""dialectic"" means the tension between two opposing forces.

http://thetruthnews.info/Hegelian_Dialectic_Process.pdf

It is where the thesis and the antithesis collide to form a synthesis.

This is how it can be used to control society:

You decide on the synthesis and you want and  deliberately create the two opposing forces that will bring it about.

Let's say that you wanted society to accept surveillance cameras on every street corner. But people fear Big Brother and refuse to accept it.

You can get society to accept it through the use of the Hegelian dialectic.

Create or instigate a segment of society that will antagonize police officers. Then adopt policies and training for police officers that will demonize civilians.

Ensure that all injustices perpetrated by cops get heavily publicized.

Then let the cops get off with no penalties.

Make video cameras the only source of justice and protection from wayward cops.

Make cops punish people who film police officers.

You now have two opposing forces.

Do this long enough and soon people will be demanding that cops wear video cameras at all times.

Add a few more instances where cops disable their cameras to commit crimes and people will demand that all streets where cops operate have cameras.

You now have a synthesis. You have people demanding surveillance.

Ever notice that making drugs illegal makes people want to do them more?

If you wanted a medicated society then you put the dialectic to work.

This is how you bring change to society. It doesn't just happen. It is deliberate.

This technique really is as old as time.

The caduceus was erroneously associated with medicine.

http://journalofophiolatry.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/caduceus.gif

But it is actually a symbolic representation of the dialectic. The thesis and the antithesis guided by the rod to the synthesis.

Also, this is the time-honored formula for movie scripts... the three act structure:

"battlefield_4","t5_2uie9","I don't know why more people take a gander on the AEK-971.  It's interesting because the AEK-971, when mastered, is the second best Assault Rifle in the game -- and it's medium range 'weakness' is actually a strength once you get the recoil control down.  

You aren't supposed to use the Assault Rifles for medium-long range combat.  You should using it for medium or closer range combat.  

I got two videos from my smurf account.  Both show the upside of the AEK-971 in close range combat -- with some selective medium range combat.  I don't like putting myself out there in the open for medium range fighting until I am certain I can win.  For example, I always rush for cover if I see a light machine gun.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8zjbYibQ2Q

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNmJP7GIow

Both rounds with 29% and 27% accuracy. 

If you really want a challenge, try the FAMAS.  It's the best weapon (in my opinion) for the Assault class.  The video below is 30% accuracy in Paracel Storm.

Although global games area always behind in content most global games get the content + new character classes that are available as well, but generally it is done separately. but either way comparing a MMO to a Game on your phone is vastly different, since a lot of content doesn't require new classes just the old classes+ extended levels.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","IMO, SSD.

This is similar to windows ""superfetch""(or whichever it was called) but tailored to only load exactly what you want it to load when windows boots, so that it is ready when you want to play it.

The only problem with pre-loading software, is that it can make booting slower, and can clog memory for when you need it for something else.(superfetch was always somewhat hotly debated).

With the advent of SSD's, if you get even a moderately good one, you can turn off all of that.

It can work for you with a regular HDD fine IF you tend to play X, and only X, and don't switch often. (or XYZ if they all fit within RAM, whatever).

It'd be kind of a niche product, not specifically something for everyone. If it does work for you, great.

And you can certainly mock the ""practical"" value of the humanities since, by definition, they are not meant to have one! I'm firmly in the camp that views what we do as specifically opposed to commodification by any means (thus, art *without* mere ""practical"" application, and thus of no use to capital).

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","Well, I have a PhD in law. It might sounds awesome, especially in the US, but here where I am it actually isn't. It doesn't mean anything. I work at the univeristy and sure, there is a lot of opportunity. But nothing is guaranteed. Mighjt happen, might not. Getting that position was already a struggle and I know many people would kill for it. Still, it's paid really low.

Anyways. My mom has always been hot blooded. She tells hurtful things and then regrets it, but this time I couldn't take it anymore. I came to my parents for Christmas. My dad is very sick so I needed to help my mom with everything. And I did. I think she was glad I came only because of that. I was my Name Day on Christmas Eve and my birthday on 26th. She didn't give a shit. I didn't get anything from her, not even wishes. She is only nice for me when she needs some help, but she doesn't give anything back. It's the worst when someone is comming over and she wants to show off. The holiday season was full of visits and it got really frustrating to prepare everything, yet not even hear a simple 'thank you'. On Sun we had guests over - a couple with a kid, so she locked my dog in a room. Sure, the dog isn't accustomed to it, but we didn't know how our guests feel about dogs. But they were OK, actually they wanted my dog to be out, but my mom says no, because the dog annoys her. The guests kept peeking into that room, so the dog was barking constantly and my mom yelled at me. I had to take my dog for a long walk despite the darkness and frost. I wanted to go back to my place right then but I had drunk some alcohol so I couldn't. I told her how I felt about it, but she didn't react at all.

Today she was all nice as she invited four people over and she needed help with preparation. I did a lot, went shopping with her and spent half of the day in the kitchen. She cleaned the living room and locked it as she didn't want the dog to come into it as she would shed some hair... When fist guest arrives the dog was excited (she knows them and they're OK with dogs), so my mom locked her in another room. She started to whine as she was afraid of the fireworks and wanted to be with us. But my mom said no. I said that in such a case I'm going to spend the whole New Year's Eve in the separate room and my mom said she's fine with it, which was really hurtful, as I helped her so much and yet she cared only about the guests. I told her that. Then she said that it's her place and if I don't like it, I can go fuck out of there. So I started to pack myself. She didn't stop me only said that she's fine with it and added that I might as well not comming again any time. She was furious, probably because the guests saw it all. Then she started to cry, but I just left. When my uncle and aunt arrived (I was already on my way), they called me and asked me to come back, but I didn't want to. After I arrived at my place my mom called me and asked if I arrived safetly, then she gave the phone to my aunt who said that my mom is as she is and I should pay no attention to it and just come back. I didn't.

I don't feel good about it. But it was just enough. I felt like I'm some sort of servant the entire time. I feel unloved and unworthy, not even my mom shows any affection towards me. It all might seem really silly, but actually it runs really deep.","1420071285"

"fatpeoplehate","t5_2x9xz","Where are you getting this garbage from? Hunter gatherers has incredible amounts of free time on their hands, and warfare and inter tribal violence wasn't prevalent at all due to the nature of small nomadic groups. All our shit went to hell when we resorted to sedentary agricultural lifestyles, which is where Steven Pinker comes with his theory of steady decline of violence.

the whole ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."" is actually a quote from Thomas Hobbes, one that Pinker assumes could be correct. However, Hobbes was an english philospher, and there have been many peer reviewed studies that showed that we were much healthier and lived better lives as hunter gatherers than we did in early civilization. 

Some simple examples include our diet, it wasn't carb heavy at all, meaning our teeth stayed in better shape much longer. Territory and property wasn't really an issue so there was no reason for warfare, the whole idea of ""this land is mine"" is what sparked most violence. Disease was at an all time low. Most epidemics require a large concentration of humans in a concentrated envirnoment. Large concentrations of humans is also where warfare comes in as well. 

Hunter gatherers on an individual level were much healthier and better off than sedentary early humans.

If the daily returns are all over the map and not closely related to any big market (bonds, etc) then the amount of leverage you can deploy is much smaller.

But if your strategy have zero risk, then just leverage 20x and double your capital every 6 month or so. You wouldn't want outsider money after a couple of years.","1420071285"

The music tries to make us think of a forlorn past, a time that's to be remembered because the present will never match up as if we were old sport's legacies sitting at home staring at replays of the big catch, but that's not the case at all. We're still on the metaphorical football team and the cheerleaders are still waiting for us to make that big catch. So it should be a happy video, probably with some upbeat music, in order to have us strive for further memories and fun times. That's what the final image should be about. We need to burn our sorrows in order to fuel the future, and remember the good times.

All-in-All, it's a great video on the complexity of Cultural marxism and the ideals of the greater good vs. the actuality of human morality. Looking forward to seeing more!

Da wurde überhaupt nichts wegmoderiert, als ich die ständig neuen Kommentare beobachtete.

&gt;Nun kennt jeder von uns (im Vgl. zu ""euch"") mindestens einen Muslim der weder intolerant noch chauvinistisch ist.

Ich kenne auch Muslime, die weder intolerant noch chauvinistisch sind. Das sind allerdings gering religiöse Muslime. 

Frag doch mal einen Muslim, der den Islam lebt, wie er im Koran steht, ob du als Nicht-Muslim seine Tochter heiraten kannst. Dann frage ihn, ob sein Sohn deine Tochter heiraten darf. Die Antwort dürfte sehr interessant werden. Würde ein ethnisch Deutscher eine solche Antwort geben, dann würdest du ihn einen Rassisten nennen.

Die von vielen Muslimen gelebte Geschlechtertrennung hat vor allem den Sinn, die Jugendlichen von ""unerwünschten"" Männern fernzuhalten, und sie für erwünschte Männer zu reservieren. Und ungläubige Männer sind natürlich grundsätzlich unerwünscht. Ungläubige Frauen hingegen werden gerne angenommen.

&gt;Was deiner verallgemeinernden Aussage Fakten entgegensetzt. Das macht dich in unseren Augen zu einem Rassisten/Islamophoben/Dummen/whatever Mitläufer.

Meine Aussage war nicht verallgemeinernd. Ich bezog mich auf den gelebten Islam, und auf eine sehr hohe Anzahl (gut die Hälfte) an Muslimen in Europa, die eine fremdenfeindliche Einstellung haben. Diese Fremdenfeindlichkeit geht mit Chauvinismus und Intoleranz einher.","1420071290"

We are each of us responsible for what we do. That understanding is, in fact, what unites us against the forces that corrupt civilization.

Therefore as socialists we understand, scientifically, how our own actions comprise an aspect of the environment for other actors, and like the environment can preferentially elicit or even 'select' specific behaviors or attitudes from others, good, ill and indifferent.

But this is, of course, to repeat the very same point that is at stake in understanding the role of firearms in society, and the behaviors and attitudes that a firearms-infused environment elicits from the actors inhabiting it. Surely if humans can alter the climate of the planet, then the distribution density of lethal firearms cropping up in the ambient environment IS also something that can be changed, in principle. To suggest otherwise is ideology.

2  Thanks to science, powers, etc., is able to heal from serious injuries that might otherwise have taken months to heal in a matter of weeks. 

3 Destroyed limbs and minor organs can be regrown, replaced, and the character can be fully recovered in less than a month. 

4 Serious damage that would leave a person horribly maimed and on life support for the rest of their (probably short) life, can be healed and be good as new in less than a week. (The miracles of science, magic, superpowers, etc.!) 

5 Over the course of a single day, is able to regenerate lost limbs, organs, and large sections of body mass, provided that one is still alive to do so. 

6 Superhuman; able to regenerate lost limbs, organs, and large sections of body mass within the span of twelve hours, provided that they don't die outright before they have a change to begin healing.

7 Able to regenerate lost limbs, organs, and large sections of body mass within the span of 6 hours, provided that they don't die outright before they have a change to begin healing.

8 Able to make a full bodily recovery, even from would-be fatal injuries in less than an hour, so long as they still are still clinically alive to do so.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I hope you'll forgive me for not citing sources or providing links, but I'm currently on mobile and currently do not have the patience to get everything together to make an adequate case. Consider everything in this post mere conjecture.

I recently read a book about logical fallacies and self-deception, and in this book, the author was discussing how individuals with injuries to specific areas of the brain can give us tremendous insight into how the brain works. One such individual was a man whose decision-making processes had somehow been disconnected from the region that allowed him to be aware of his internal emotional states. This man, before his injury, had been successful, happily married, etc. And even though he seemed perfectly normal at first, his entire life began to deteriorate within a matter of months, possibly even weeks. It turns out, that without emotions to guide his decision making process, he was completely incapable of making *even the simplest of decisions.* 
You see, emotions were not created within a vacuum; they **evolved** over a very **extensive period of time**. And they persisted because, for the most part, they immensely aided the survivability of all creatures which possessed them. We feel joy when good things happen(to us), because good things help us survive or reproduce, and the ""good"" feeling makes us continually strive to recreate it. This is why we derive so much pleasure from things like eating and sexual intercourse; if we did not do these things, we would fail to reproduce. The same line of reasoning can be applied to every primary emotional state. Sadness tells us that we lost something valuable, and colors our future decision making to minimize future losses. Fear tells us that something bad is going to happen, and that we must try to escape from that thing. Anger tells us that we *cannot* escape that thing, so we must try to destroy it. Decision making, at its core, is an emotional process. You cannot have one without the other.
This is why the man with brain damage could not make even simple decisions for himself. He couldn't even decide what to eat or which color tie to wear. He would sit an mull over an endlessly expanding list of potential pros and cons, but ultimately, none of those variables held an ounce of emotional weight, so none of them actually mattered. We make decisions, based on the information we currently have, in order to maximize perceived benefit to ourselves. And how do we determine what is beneficial? Our emotions tell us. The only thing our highly-evolved brains really do is allow us to process more information, and therefore incorporate more emotional variables into our decision making processes. A mouse's brain may not be able to juggle as many emotional inputs as a human's brain, but a mouse most certainly can experience the same raw emotional states as a human. If animals do not experience the same emotional states as humans, then the entire field of evolutionary psychology is undoubtedly false, and the entire theory of evolution is, by extension, also false. But that is not the case. Theories based on the principles I have (inadequately) described here have both predictive *and* explanatory power.

The question ""do animals have emotions"" really only becomes difficult to answer when your mind is clouded by religious thinking, solipsism, and other metaphysical horseshit. Science may not have all the answers, but it definitely has *a metric fuckload* of answers. There are some questions that we already have the answers to, and this is one of them. It's time to move on to the other questions that this answer raises.","1420071300"

No seriously, have you played any game at all before x and y because you can dodge pretty much any trainer in any pokemon game.

It's more or less the reason I was always so under leveled as a kid because I would just avoid everyone.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The scariest thing is that the US is so arrogant and utterly blind, being completely convinced that their way of life (democracy, ""freedom"" to do anything) is THE best in the world. Just like how Britain tried to civilize Africa, the US is making similar mistakes in trying to 'colonize' the rest of the world with their worldview. Many of the wars that were supposed to 'free nations' and 'promote democracy' have in fact failed in non-Western nations. To simply say nation building failed because of corrupt politicians is a weak scapegoat from what I think is the truth: some countries were never meant to have democracy and freedoms the way the US advocates because they don't place as high a value on those concepts.

Let me explain what I mean. Part of this btw was influenced by Kissinger's latest book World Order. Historically, the US has always been an individualistic nation, and the concept of 'freedom' initially from the British but later as rights to say anything, freedom of markets from government intervention, and rights to bear arms to ensure freedom has become so ingrained in American culture that we now think of freedom as the freedom to individualistically be who we are without oppression (provided we are lawful in our means to achieve that freedom). The idea that individuals are what the focus should be on reaches its zenith in the idea in the ""American Dream."" And so whenever the Americans think of World peace, what they think of is a world where every individual is free to do what they want and elect whomever they want.

The problem is this conception of individualism, a national identity and freedom is not necessarily the most important thing to other nations. Some nations value the group more than the individual. Chinese culture has heavily been focused since at least 500 BC with Confucius on the ideas of harmony and working together, not individualism. Some ideas of Chinese Communism, of a whole nation working together under one government, isn't that crazy because it enables a harmonious society which at its core is somewhat aligned with traditional Chinese cultural values, provided the government isn't dictatorial (which I admit it initially was). Moreover, there are nations that value religion far more than freedom. You know how we have tried to deal with the Middle East by promoting American values? One of many problems is some of those values conflict with traditional religious views, especially in very strict communities. Blasphemy laws to us are barbaric, but to them are critical because they value God more than freedom so Americans are thus barbaric. Moreover Kissinger argues there is a belief by some that uniting people under one religion is the best way to world peace and when they truly believe it as much as we truly believe democracy is the path to peace, you have conflicting views on what world order can be. Then you have a place like Iraq. There never was a strong Iraqi national identity akin to American patriotism; Saddam Hussein was the glue that held many of the separate sects together. Upon his removal and attempts to install democracy, sectarian violence began to spring up because unlike America where people are willing to put away past grievances because they are all Americans, in many of the Muslim world, religious identity (Shiite or Sunni) is far more important than being Iraqi.

Ultimately, the scary thing is many Americans are blind and are pushing their views onto others. Just like how Americans can be scared of terrorists and religious zealots, the converse can be said to be true: some other nations are equally scared of Americans trying to convert people to their 'religion' of democracy and freedom. As a result, there will be push-back. And when both parties think the other is disrupting their values and what they believe to be world order, then you will have conflict, such as during the Cold War. 

I should also clarify I'm not trying to defend all non-American nations. When you have a current mass genocide like in Rwanda, then someone should step in to do something in my opinion. However, I don't think it's right to go around pushing an American agenda, and as we can see, that really upset Russia over Ukraine, where America promoted the toppling of the democratically elected pro-Russia government.

TL;DR - Many Americans play a dangerous game assuming their values are the best. Other ethnic groups value other things such as harmony/working together or religion over core American values, so that attempt at converting others can and has led to dangerous pushback/conflicts.","1420071308"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt;However putting in the same sack the christians that, although openly so, let each one to their own, and those that abuse the respect personal belief is entitled to to get away with judgment and imposing moral agendas I think is falling into the same moral trap. I think each one should be evaluated by their merits and not because they have one label in common with those that have failed the test. 

Here's the thing: If you keep religion to yourself, you're likely not even going to REMOTELY mention religion, or any aspect towards it, to any other party.  In terms of the atheist community that I personally know, I don't see any going up to someone and giving some snarky comment about belief.  You see that in perhaps high schoolers or college students, but aside from that not much outside.

It doesn't mean that people hide their religions.  It's more that, in order for *this specific type of conversation to come up*, it requires quite a bit of digging and dredging unless the instigator is the self-professed Christian that, after 

Here's the likely thing: What's wrong with admitting not knowing a whole lot, and saying that you're in the process of studying the religion?  Saying something as simple as, ""Yeah, I really don't know a whole lot about Christianity but I'm in the process of learning,"" actually defuses everything.  I would assume that any new believer would actually say this.  

&gt;Does it irritate you to find someone that claims to be a christian, has not insinuated any judgment over you or others, yet when asked has little knowledge about the bible? 

Does it irritate me when someone calls themselves a Marvel Comics fan, and at the end of the Avengers, is confused about the purple-faced guy at the end of the movie?  No, though I'd know he's not the most knowledgeable of fans.

Same goes for here.  If someone were to call themselves a Christian, and a devout one at that, and they have little clue as to the 10 Commandments, or the roles of David and Solomon, or have little idea of who Paul was or that the latter books were letters to various places reflecting on their weaknesses on Christianity, I'd get a pretty good idea that they're not particularly *that* devout about their association.  

I *would* say that it's embarrassing that me, a non-believer, knows quite a bit more about the history of the their own religion and the stories presented better than they did.  But otherwise, what do I care?

&gt;Does that person need to read the bible for their opinion on abortion to be any more valid than yours? 

Does it irritate me when someone calls themselves a Marvel Comics fan *in order to impress the hot girl he's trying to bang*  and is confused about the purple-faced guy at the end of the movie, and then doesn't give a shit when you tell him that he should be excited about Thanos making it to the big screen?  Yes.  Using your merits of association as some sort of credit or insight into something, only to find yourself clueless is more than a little irritating.

An opinion is only as good as the data that backs that idea.  Throwing in religion and the Bible alone are simply poor, but it's done and it's absolutely *insulting*.  And in fact, in such a debate, it's the *teachings* of a religion in terms of the moral choices that should be used, not the physical book itself.  If you start your argument with, ""The Bible teaches that..."" to an atheist or someone of a different denomination, it holds no power, has no relevance.

And that's morals and themes within the Bible.  If you cannot even grasp the basic *characters* or *events* within the book, I doubt you even can gather these other higher level ideas from the very source of a religious individual's belief.

Now, here's the interesting part.  I know a bit about Christian history and the religion, and a bit about Islam and Judaism as well.  What tends to happen is that, if I'm discussing religion with someone that really knows their religion, knows the history and so forth, the discussions tend to make a lot more sense, the philosophies tends to be much more thorough and consistent.  It's not a belief for the sake of believing; it's a belief that is based around a perspective.  And in that sense, it makes talking about issues not about religion at all, but in terms of a perspective that centers around a religious and historical background.

In an abortion discussion, it tends to be a discussion on the merits or detriments, the morality, of abortion based on perspectives.  For a religious person that really knows their shit, it's never *about the religion itself*.  I can understand the perspective.","1420071308"

And as for my friend, it happened right after high school I wasn't in the Air Force yet, and it's sad since I knew her beginning in middle school, she was like a super smart nerdy girl, and when we got to high school she kind of went a little crazy to be popular, kind of slutty but was still really smart, and after high school she started stripping at the pink pony, met a marine, and got married after two weeks and then like a few months into the marriage he strangled her, I'll post the link. And yea I've noticed there's been several marines that snapped, the one that gets me is the one where the marine knocks up another marines wife in California and then murders her anyways here's the link to my friends story

"vegetarian","t5_2qm7x","What kind of camping are you doing?

If it's backpacking, and you have to carry all your food, I would suggest freeze-dried meals, either made at home using a dehydrator or store bought (although this can get pretty pricey) A great lunch on the go is just tortillas and peanut butter/jam/nutella, and maybe fruit like apples or oranges. You can also get vegetarian dry soup mixes. These often taste awful, but are cheap, quick and great to warm yourself up.

If you're just going car camping, I love to make veggie chilli ahead of time and bring it in ziplock bags. Spaghetti with tomato sauce is also great, you can make/buy veggie meat balls that just need to be reheated, or put veggie ground round in the sauce if you want a protein. I also love home made pureed soups when I don't have to carry them.

"tolkienfans","t5_2r6jm","In Letters, Tolkien, talking about a hypothetical occurring when the Ring is at Mount Doom, uses the term 'the Eight', mentioning that the 'Witch-king had been reduced to impotence'. He has been killed, but beyond that he has been laid so low as to be irrelevant from then on. However, it can be argued that being killed didn't release him from the power of the Rings, so he should still be around. He shouldn't find the natural progression of Man into Death until after the destruction of the Ring (some people argue not even then, but I strongly disagree).

The passage the two of you were talking about, I think, is enough. We don't need to look to other books, just to previous paragraphs. This is actually the second wraith in so many pages to pass above the Hobbits. However, the first incident (where, the clouds still thick, there is no visual description) seems to take some time. Frodo and Sam are described as crouching under a boulder and not speaking for some time, until Frodo finally senses it has passed. Before they start moving again, Theoden is stated to be at that moment dying. 

With the second passage, the whole scene, a transit from far away . Perhaps a long pause, but still just that, with no indication by the author that any great deal of time has passed, like in the first Nazgul's flight. Even seeing it before they feel it (as was the only indication of the first), there's a speed that marks it as something different. The second passage ends with the statement that the Lord of the Nazgul is dead, and from the pronouncement appears to be making the same sort of claim of immediacy as it did with Theoden.

Given that, I lean more towards his interpretation. But I'm not going to say it couldn't be one of the other Nazgul flying like a bat out of hell to report. There's simply too much attention drawn to it for me to think we are witnessing anything left than the death-visage of Lord of the Nazgul.","1420071312"

But is high school, he starting hanging out with some guys who drank, smoked, and did generally stupid stuff. The problem was that my friend wouldn't say no. On the few occasions I was with them, I could say no and not be an idiot no problem and they didn't bother me about it. But my friend couldn't. 

I went off to college while they stayed in our town working and being stupid. By that point I almost never talked to my best friend anymore. Then he tells me he has to go into rehab for 13 months. He said he regretted not spending more time with me and getting involved with drinking and stealing. So now I really don't have a friend. Or maybe I do, but he's going to be in rehab somewhere for the next year.

"MvC3","t5_2s01r","I've been playing Nem since day and I can tell you it's always been a struggle. As long as you noodle, and noodle often, you'll be fine. Just don't do anything too stupid with him.

The spacing varies for different cast members as their individual air series puts the spacing sort of odd at times, but 9/10 times you can adjust the spacing by delaying either j.h or j.s when Nem comes in. Because of where this puts phoenix after the series, she's within his grab range (just below super jump height).

The reason I say to input the anti air grab just after the super flash is because of the super lame startup on Nem's grab. If you start the grab a few frames too late, Phoenix will literally just drop right in front of Nem after a whiffed grab. You can technically wait til you see the animation for Phoenix's hyper to input it as well, but to get the ""guaranteed"" grab I would do it just after the flash.

***Sidenote:*** I realize now that some of this might be hard to follow considering I didn't mention that you obviously have to wait for Nem to hit the ground again, but by the time her super flash goes off, he's already back on the ground. You could, in theory, just walk backwards and allow phoenix to fall a little ways. Upon the other player trying to xfc and dash somewhere you can react to it since you'll still be in range for any of his grabs. But that's assuming the other player knows the Nem setup ***and*** missed the TAC.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","""The right to place demands on others"" is what a positive right is, and it's only used for things where people need defending from having their rights violated. This is why childcare applies in this situation. *Somebody* has to take responsibility for this child, and that means you either give the child up for adoption or make the parents do it. And child support doesn't only apply to men. Women have to sacrifice their lives and finance by law if they choose to keep the child as well.

Let's not forget that the man in our situation could have avoided it early on. He has full rights to prevent a pregnancy before it happens. Of course he has fewer rights once it's occurring within someone else's body.

The fact that the woman's rights, that it would be barbaric to take from her, protect her decisions during this period isn't ideal, but it's a biological fact and you can't get around that without repercussions that are worse than the status quo. ","1420071319"

I assume we're talking standard 240 pin DDR3 (not that peasant DDr2 shit)?

Also, it would be beneficial to give it away before you buy it. That way, whoever wins can tell you what RAM they have, so that we can use it with our existing RAM (since they say to never mix RAM sets). That way, say, my 2x 4GB sticks wouldn't be down for the count if you were to buy better RAM. We could either choose to match our current set of RAM, or upgrade entirely - say, if I won, I could either choose to go with some more Corsair Vengeance 1600 mHz DDR3 RAM to add to what I have, or upgrade entirely, if, say, you were giving out a 16GB stick of 2400 mHz DDR3.

Also, can it be a fancy looking stick? I have a window in my case, so I would personally prefer something like the Corsair Vengeance RAM with the casing/heatsink as opposed to a bland looking bare circuit board.","1420071320"

My buddy chips it in from the rough for a birdie. I have about a 55-60 foot putt. Drain it for birdie. It was easily the weirdest, most surreal moment I've ever had on the course.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","He's... kinda right and kinda wrong at the same. He says by making Melee 2.0, then the casual audience will be alienated. This is not true. Most fans will play Smash Bros no matter what. But he's afraid of having someone good walk into a party, combo the shit out of a casual, and leave, resulting in the Casual  being super salty. This, according to Sakurai, will turn fans away from the series. He is very, very wrong here. 85% of the people are going to buy the game regardless of the physics. The thing that will make or break the game, in my opinion, is the roster (as I personally know a person who bought the game just because Lucina was a character, as we all do), but I digress.


What I interpreted from what  Sakurai is trying to say here is that if you only care for the pure competitive aspect of Smash ***ALONE***, just the combos and physics, then you should go.  He wants people to actually experience the full game instead of just grinding For Glory or something. I'm an offender of that rule currently, as I haven't used every final smash, nor have I played on every stage or collected every song or tried every challenge (A habit that I have recently stopped). Sakurai wants this to be a  fun party game, rather than a sport. He wants people to have fun with the game, but doesn't think that the competitive scene is fun for people.   

He's semi-right on his idea of having a faster game vs a slower game though. This is similar to the League of Legends vs Dota 2 debate. Dota 2 is much harder, and thus turns away some people who aren't able to keep up with it. League is much easier, and therefore more accessible. This is his philosophy. This works for LoL because it is strictly competitive, with a second emphasis on fun. The argument of having a slower game, rather than a fast game is not as effective for Smash, as people buy it for fun first, then a competitive scene second.

This quote in itself means that if Nintendo wants to make Super Melee Bros 4.0, this would ruin the series, and it will not at all. People will buy the game regardless. Also, people are going to rage if they get stomped by someone better, such is life. But you don't see the millions of LoL players quiting after getting beat by someone with better mechanics. Heck, I would personally try harder to get better. I'm really thankfully for Smash 4 as it allows me to get a small look at what a competitive scene is, due to the slower speed. But keeping the game intentionally slow on the basis of preventing it from turning away players is really dumb.

But that's just my $0.02

  
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  

 ***TL;DR: If it says ""Super Smash Bros"", we will buy it. Regardless of game speed and physics.***

 Edit: Made a lot of edits.   
 Edit2: Added a tl;dr

  
Also, if I get junked by someone that's better than me in a friendly game, I'll still be having fun. If I wasn't up to the level of competitive smashers in something like PM, I would not go to a PM tournament to get trashed. I'll still be playing Smash and I'll still be having fun with his game, just not with  someone that trashes me in an unfun way. This is what Sakurai needs to take notice of.","1420071322"

NOW IMAGINE... that you want to add a person (from a real video footage) to it 8-) you must adapt the light of the person to fit the room, or you must adapt the room lightning to fit the lightning of the person you add to it, at this moment you must change values and try out, rerender, retry, then add movement, oh dear, per frame wise checking if it fits still? what is with blur? camera makes blur, you need to adapt this to the rendering that must also be blurring in the same way.... you see there are a lot of little details which no computer can adapt automatically as its just a ""subjective"" thing.... its just relevant if it ""fits"" to what we as human expect..... A LOT OF WORK...... :)

Two examples:



Market Failure Caused by Imperfect Information, Donald N. Stengel

&gt; One such instance is where one party in an economic exchange deliberately exploits the ignorance of another party in the transaction to its own advantage and to the disadvantage of the unknowing party. This type of situation is called a moral hazard. For example, if an entrepreneur is raising capital from outside investors, he may present a biased view of the prospects of the firm that only includes the good side of the venture to attract the capital, but the outside investors eventually lose their money due to potentially knowable problems that would have discouraged their investment if those problems had been known.

"Anticonsumption","t5_2r83n","&gt; We were remarking on how all new builds are so big and how it's so weird

Exactly. Ours is a ""starter home"" and yet it's 1200 ft^2 , with an unfinished basement and a 3 stall garage. This is the only home we plan on living in now. Apparently, we'll be having new neighbors constantly since we're just in a ""starter"" neighborhood. Ridiculous.

&gt;My husband and I live in a mass produced ""cracker box"" very much like the first picture. It's about 1100 square feet, built in the early 50s and solid as a tank.

I love these neighborhoods, and am jealous of you. We tried to put offers on a couple of the houses like these that were in decent shape, but they were sold literally hours after being on the market. You're correct in that these houses are in high demand. The weird part is that in some of these neighborhoods, people seem to be buying the houses to use as rental properties - and the quality of neighborhoods seem to be going downhill because of it. I would LOVE to see newer neighborhoods with these houses.

&gt;When we first moved in here, we had the typical ""starter home"" mentality, figuring we'd upgrade in five to ten years. We only have one bathroom, and while we have four bedrooms, they're small, and their number comes at the expense of a dining room and a living room that can comfortably fit more than us and a few friends.

Our newer house does have some advantages:

The basement has a large family room, so that when it's finished, it can fit all of our ""activities"" - Our 8 ft. pool table, a gaming/board game table and chairs/couch, and my gun safe. We have those items in the basement right now, it just isn't finished off. 

The 3rd stall in the garage will be my shop/woodworking area, so all the tools I have from my grandpa will actually be usable. With the small cracker box house neighborhoods, I've never seen more than a double stall, and most of them are single stalls; We want a garden as well, and a lot of the older neighborhoods have a pretty small lot size already.

When the basement is entirely finished off, we will have 2 more bedrooms and a 3rd bathroom. So, it'll be a 4 bedroom, 3 bath, dedicated laundry room ""starter home"". Still blows my mind that people think they need more than this. I can even use one of the basement bedrooms for a home office if I decide to quit working for someone else. We'll see what happens. 

-----------------------------------

On a side note, 2 of the people that are married that my SO and I went to school with are looking at houses now. They're looking at a $450,000 house, ""but aren't sure it's big enough"".

I've long felt that most, if not all religions, are such that their belief systems are not going to be fully represented by either party in the U.S. two-party system.

It bothers me when religion will temporarily ally itself with a political party, in ways that gloss over these differences.  I'm glad that this bond or identification, which I think is problematic, between the GOP and Catholic church, is being more directly questioned now.","1420071329"

We had to do a project about a famous company from Arkansas and we had two weeks to complete a poster, a PowerPoint presentation, or a construction paper booklet describing said company. I worked my scrawny preteen girl ass off on that fucking poster for AT LEAST two hours each night for that goddamned project, meticulously following the rubric in every area to ensure that I covered every area and then some on the topic. My poster was incredible- I had made notecards and everything for my presentation and rehearsed for three days in front of the mirror. My presentation was immaculate and precise, covering everything in detail that was required of the assignment. I was so proud of myself. The next week, however, I received the graded rubric back from the teacher. She gave me a 37/150. I reviewed the poster and she marked everything off except the title and my name. Holy shit. At first I thought I just severely fucked up the assignment, so I went to her and asked if she could help me understand where my information was inaccurate and how to correct myself in the future. ""Oh no your information is spot on."" WHY DO I HAVE SUCH A SHITTY GRADE OMG?! ""I gave you this grade because I feel you didn't deserve a higher one. I'll give you a few points back, but you know you don't actually need them."" I was furious. She gave me eleven points to add to the grade, a meager amount. My mother made arrangements to meet with her about the issue and the bitch never returned any calls and avoided being available until the next semester, during which she did the same thing for nearly every assignment I was given.

"halo","t5_2qixk","Yup, I agree completely. The movement feels good, satisfying even, but it completely eliminates much of the strategy that used to be required to properly navigate a map. This is a bigger deal than a lot of people probably realize, it fundamentally changes the way that games play out. No longer is there much of a consequence for putting yourself in a strategically crappy position. In past Halo games, getting out of position from the rest of your team was basically a death sentence, and this meant that players had to be really smart about how they moved around the map. 

Say you're playing Halo 2 TDM on Lockout and you spawn near the lift. Your team is at the sniper spawn, and the other team is at top BR. How do you go about navigating the map?  You can approach the enemy team from many different routes, each of which will have advantages and disadvantages based on the state of the game. You can easily get yourself in a position where your team can't cover you and be an easy kill. Alternatively, you can use a smart shortcut (which you would have to know the jumping physics to use) and get into a perfect position to catch the other team off guard. The same is true if you want to rejoin your team: do you play it safe and take the long walkway? What if your team is engaged in a fight that you'll be out of position to assist with? Lots of people think that being good at Halo is all about knowing how to four-shot with the BR, but this isn’t even close to all that there is. Situational awareness and good decision making is a HUGE part of Halo.

My main point is that in Halo games past, you couldn't just unmake a shitty decision. You couldn't overextend yourself and then say ""uh oh, my bad, better go the other way"" against a competent enemy team. In the H5 beta, this is almost entirely reversed. With sprint, thruster pack, and clamber, anyone can be anywhere on the map very quickly. More to the point, they can get themselves out of a bad position in a heartbeat. Because you move so damn quickly there is much less of a disincentive  to run off alone towards the enemy team. After all, you might get a lucky kill, and if it doesn’t work out for you you can zip back to cover and sprint back to your team. This reduces the part of the skill gap associated with map knowledge and awareness, and makes the matches feel random and chaotic. I'm sick to death of watching kill cams of guys zipping up behind a team with an SMG, aiming down the sights for a triple kill spray from across the room, and zipping back out in a matter of seconds (on another note, why are the AR and SMG like sniper rifles now?). These movement convenience features feel nice at first, but they do too much of the important work for you. They make EVERYONE a master at map navigation and eliminate much of the need for good decision making. Map control, situational awareness, and teamwork are not made insignificant, but they are heavily devalued, while the COD style run and gun mentality isn’t punished nearly as much as it should be. 

343 is hardly concealing the fact that they’re looking for a new audience with this game, and you can’t really be too surprised. Business is business, and I don’t blame them for making the changes that they’re making. The people that played the original Halo games as kids are adults now, and they’re trying to hook a new generation of young people on these new games. It isn’t a secret that most kids would prefer to play a game that makes them feel like a badass right off the bat over a game that punishes them repeatedly until they learn how to play properly. This game is completely playable and highly polished, but I really don’t find playing it rewarding. I’ve done really well in the Beta, far better in fact than I typically do in Halo games, but I’m finding myself getting frustrated even in matches where I know I’m going to win and I’m doing very well. It all feels like too much of a clusterfuck for my tastes, but I understand that lots of people will probably really like it.

Moving from the theoretical to the practical, you want to take some of the excellent advice posted here: use online tutorials, books, get a teacher, etc. Learn your sales, arpeggios, etc.

I suggest you also make time to play the riffs, scales, arpeggios, etc with the intent on listening to yourself. During this time, do not worry about technique at all. Instead, focus on how you emotionally react to the sounds that you make. Try to recreate some of those emotional reactions. Experiment with how these sounds make you feel. This exercise will teach you to be more expressive in your playing. Take your time, and keep a Bob Ross mindset: no mistakes, only happy accidents.","1420071333"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;What is your threshold for exceptionally dangerous?

I dunno - two standard deviations? Not sure I understand the point of the question.

My issue here isn't to figure out who is exceptionally dangerous and who's not. It's to point out that we have this cultural impression of police work as dangerous which doesn't track well with reality. Our perception of the dangers of policing doesn't come from reality - it comes from media, movies, etc. 

Why is it that we have this cultural perception of police work as dangerous, but we don't have that perception for construction work, which is empirically more dangerous? That's the issue I'm trying to get at. To try to disabuse people of this notion that police work is somehow uniquely dangerous. I think we need to drop that notion, since it infects the way we think about putting parameters around how police operate.

&gt;And the valorisation isn't from the danger it's because police historically take a risk so that civilians don't have to. If you feel like you can face off the next murderer in your area feel free to not ""valorise"" police, but until then you owe them some modicum of respect respect.

The idea that the police ""face off"" with murderers is hilarious. It's absurd.  This is what I'm talking about; this notion about what police are is ridiculously skewed from reality. Police investigate murder, and they act as a form of intermediary which can prevent situations from escalating to murder (for example, they respond to a call on domestic violence, which, in the absence of police, could escalate to a more dangerous scenario). But the idea that the police see a murder about to happen and leap into action to stop it red-handed? I mean, please. That almost never happens, just logistically.

Police are important. But they aren't superheroes.","1420071337"

"DarkEnlightenment","t5_2xhxs","Tribalism is why democracy can not function in most regions of the world. It would be interesting to find IQ distributions of latinos and compare them to other groups. My hypothesis is that there would be a small group with very high IQs and the majority with very low IQs. 

Within the tribe itself, even if the leader is working against the individual members best interests they will blindly follow him. 

Machiavellian way to handle the situation is to find out who is the patriarch of the clan. This is more complicated then it appears. Once you find this individual, then negotiate with him one on one. They are usually are highly intelligent and extremely rational. This is why I have the hypothesis about IQ distribution.

So in the case of the drug gang, the head cop should negotiate with the patriarch and tell him to keep his guys in line. 

I am not familiar with latino clans but 160 sounds small. There is a distinct possibility that they did not get the entire clan or the leader. 

By weakening this particular clan the LAPD has created a vacumn. What will then happen is neighboring clans will then fight for control of this vacumn. I am not sure if this is part of the LAPD's plan or just stupidity.

*psummary* which lists all currently active non-beta projects

*psummaryB* which lists all currently active beta projects

and

*psummaryC* which lists **all** currently active projects (ie the sum of the other two)

Well, they are supposed to list them :-p

Another relevant point (aiui) is that those pages are not ""lists"" in the usual sense of (eg) a simple text file- they are compiled ""on the fly"" by interrogating the WS's at demand time to see what they've got.

So a problem with a WS, one being omitted from the scan list, any number of reasons could result in a project not being included. I believe that the current problem with missing projects is largely due to unexpected incompatibilities between servers as infrastructure changes are implemented, and is known about.

A contract must be signed in good faith. If one person has a reasonable expectation that something is not in a contract, then it can be thrown out in a courtroom and a contract that takes away legal rights is not valid. 

A couple of good arguments: 

1. You have a right to make at least minimum wage. If your tips after the cut do not equate to that minimum wage, then you are being deprived of a legal right.

2. Dine-n-dashing is a systematic failure. The entrances are not monitored, your job responsibilities inherently make it impossible to always watch the customers.","1420071349"

I don't think killing them and eating them is wrong, but I do think that causing them unnecessary suffering during their entire lives and in their death is right (edit: is NOT right...lulz). We should push for the best practices and even then we should reduce our ridiculous amounts of meat consumption.

For less than two days I would be surprised to see levels over 1.0, especially since you did not feed her. (I had to cycle a friends tank, 2.5 gallons with one male betta, and got .50 after one day) 

Ammonia becomes toxic at 0.5 ppm, It is usually acceptable at 0.25 for cycling purposes. High levels of ammonia can damage fishes gills, making it harder for them to get oxygen out of the water. 

Nitrate is ok under 40, and lower is better. It is the end result from ammonia-nitrite-nitrate. So the more ammonia you start with the more nitrate you end up with. It does not directly harm fish, but high levels for extended periods of time can negatively affect them. ","1420071354"

- *Pushbullet* - lets you transfer files/links/text between Chrome and your phone (download the Chrome extension too)
- *Reddit Sync* - probably my favourite Reddit app, there's also Reddit Is Fun
- *IFTTT* - ""If This, Then That"" lets you set up recipes for your phone e.g. I'm using one where I'll get a notification if rain is forecast for the following day. Also a notification any time Biffy Clyro tweet lol.
- *Muzei* - lets you set up various live wallpapers from a number of sources. I'm currently cycling through a folder full of Fallout related wallpapers that change every 3 hours.
- *NovaLauncher* - exactly what it says on the tin, it's a launcher, and I've coupled it with..
- *Voxel* - icon pack that I really like, there's tonnes of other nice icon packs though e.g. Moonshine, Numix and Gel are a couple of nice free ones
- *Tinfoil for Facebook* - Facebook app that runs through the mobile web version, so it takes up waaaaaay less RAM, you can also couple this with IFTTT and use a recipe that sends you facebook notifications using the RSS feed you can grab from the mobile FB site

Other than that there's games like TwoDots and Plague Inc. that I enjoy. Plus a weather app, sports app, QR reader, Netflix, Amazon, Dropbox and any other stores you use often/bank you're connected to etc. ","1420071355"

Translation (general, not verse by verse, couse i'm lazy):

All of the nations mentioned (the list is quite long) above are meeting daily on the UN forum complain about peoples, nations, countries, but not about poverty.

In the interview Jay says:

When I was there I heard from a few people that [Koenig] was harassing people at their jobs, making countless phone calls [to people] who kept saying they did not want to speak with her. ...

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","I'm guessing manga books don't count? :P

I'm a big fan of the movie 5 Centimeters Per Second. It's available fully English subbed [here on Youtube and is only 1 hour long](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVbnt4vQE6w). It can appear to be a boring movie from the outside. There's no amazing people with superpowers or even villains. It's just focused on a story between a guy and a girl who become close friends, but life forces them to move away from each other. It takes place in a time where cellphones weren't commonly in use, so they had to communicate the old-fashioned way with hand-written letters.

It's depressingly realistic. The title refers to the speed of the cherry blossom petals falling from the tree. They're symbolic of people, because people start out close together like the petals on the cherry blossom, but they scatter and gradually drift apart. The ending is just an emotional gut punch, but I love it because again, it's extremely realistic and based on life.

It's kind of interesting though because now we have all these forms of social media and the Internet. I wonder if this movie would be less applicable to kids who are growing up now in the age of social media.

Also the animation is stunning, and I believe handdrawn? I think [this scene](http://thecajunsamurai.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5centimeterspersecond-5.jpg) from the movie is one of my favorites because the landscape is so beautiful. It's basically scenery porn.

Happy New Years!!!

"educationalgifs","t5_2w708","&gt;There is really only mass famine due to the violence

Not necessarily. See 1990's Rawanda. The genocide was ultimately caused by overpopulation and famine, pushing existing racial tensions (tensions that exist in many many countries today.. even ""developed"" ones) over the edge and invoking a mass wave of violence. 


&gt; The world produces more food than every human actually needs, famine is a pure distribution problem.

Sure, just as there is plenty of water locked away in Antarctica.. this argument is pointless since it does nothing to address the actual problem.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I'm white and I live in Canada. I've never called 911 in my life, never filed a police report, and never been detained by the police.

I live in a poor community with a lot of petty crime, but violent crime is almost unheard of, and I KNOW that if there was ever a real problem, the police would respond and deal with me and the incident fairly. 

I think that's the important difference. My community has faith in the police, and even though there are very few officers patrolling the streets, we know that they will actually respond when we need them to.

I honestly can't imagine what it would be like to live somewhere where there was gun crime, and people genuinely felt that the police would only make matters worse.

I hear a lot of comments on Reddit to the effect that ""Don't call the cops, they'll just kill your dog and make problems worse"" but this is so divorced from my experience that it sounds insane to me.

I think that the problems in a lot of American cities are systemic and obviously cultural and racial. It's not fair to expect a police force to be able to sort this out. There needs to be bridge-building between cultures and communities.

I want to see some wealthy property and business owners walk into the poor communities that exist adjacent to their suburbs and honestly try to engage in dialogue with people.

We don't need a million man march, we need ten thousand hundred man marches. We need white people living in safe communities to genuinely cross the street and try to understand what it's like to live in a community where the law is scary, police are the enemy, and envy, fear, hate, and prejudice define the relationship between communities and the wealth establishment.

Maybe then we would see some real reconciliation.

The Sierra Club got tired of getting beaten by economic arguments.  They decided to find out the economic value of *not* damming a river.  They surveyed people who used the river for recreation, those who might do so, and those who just valued wilderness even though they never planned to visit that particular river.  They used an economic argument to show that the river was more valuable without a dam.  Of course there's a counterargument, but my point is that economic arguments can be used by people who advocate for the poor -- and it's probably a good idea to do so.","1420071367"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","I'm not sure what point your making but this is something to note. Never mind overlooking that schools like Eton and Harrow are the tiny percentage of public schools in the country in how they are, that hedge fund manager's son doesn't get anywhere near Eton unless he's really really intelligent. 

It's notoriously difficult to get a place there, probably the hardest 11+ exams in the country and an interview. Also they weed out Boys who get Bs from first year to sixth form. That's why 95% of all their GCSE grades are A/A* and 83% of all A level grades are A/A*. Of course wealth goes a long way, but when people dismiss them and attribute all their academic success to it it's ridiculous. The 45 boys a year that Eton send to Oxbridge are legitimately extremely intelligent and hard working and deserve their place there.  

I went to a top 50 independent, we had about 4000 applications a year with 150 places after examinations and then a interview with about 3 kids a year loosing their place because of low grades. Pretty much everyone in my year bar some of the drama, music and sports scholars (own talent) were legitimately very clever. I'm from a working class background, yes there were quite a few wealthy people at my school but it's greatly exaggerated by the mindset that every private school is like Eton. Most are not, most kids from my school came from your fairly average middle class family who made a lot of sacrifices to send their kids to private school. There also about 40 on scholarships/bursaries a year - many from low income families. ","1420071367"

5% is the minimum Crit Chance and 25% is the maximum

A successful Crit multiplies damage by 2

Total damage is then randomized to between 50% and 150% of its current value.

For XCOM Aircraft:
If the appropriate UFO analysis has been researched, total damage is multiplied by 1.1

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","Oh man, high school. I was once sent to see the principal because a teacher saw me put my hand to my mouth and assumed I was ingesting some imaginary drug-- I had wiped my lips with a bit of napkin. People just refused to accept that I was that thin not just naturally, but in spite of my best efforts.

&gt;I don't have the medical problems you do, so sorry you have to go through this, stay strong.

Thanks. In retrospect, I can offer the following advice that you are welcome to dismiss:

* Obtain and wear clothes that actually fit. I know that can be difficult, but well-fitting clothes really do make any build look better.

* Stand up for yourself. Teachers may be authority figures, but as you implied there are definite limits on their authority, and more importantly there are limits to what is appropriate workplace behavior. ""This is my natural build. If you don't stop harassing me, I'll have to inform the principal."" (Say that politely!)

* This may be cliche at this point, but it really does get better. Almost everyone in high school is an asshole to some degree or another and eventually most of them grow out of it. In the meantime, try not to be one of those people as well, even if it often seems justified.","1420071369"

There's a few more interesting ideas, but most of them go outside of normal 'how can I buff my fawboat to eat through shields'.

There are doffs that give you a chance to ignore part of your target's shields after using Beam: Overload (commonly followed by CRF or THY/TS). Transphasic torpedoes/mines are also nasty in the shield-penetrating department.

The real place, though, is exotic damage. Graga Mal'd TBR, Grav wells, Tyken's, Feedback Pulse, EWP, all of those will completely ignore shields (Edit: Feedback Pulse splits 50% hull 50% shields, still hits hull like a truck done right though), and 4 of those have the advantage of discouraging movement/making it impossible.

If I feel that someone is dominating a conversation and continually returning the focus to their issues (rather than taking turns, and assuming that this is a conversation that doesn't necessitate constant focus on a single party), then I just follow their cues while engaging with them.  I wait to answer questions, I give nods and input where they expect or ask for it, and above all, I just *wait for my turn to talk*.

If we reach a point of silence, and they don't fill it with their own monologue, then I will take a turn.  Great.

If we do not, then I just keep conducting that conversation as usual.  This isn't difficult for me because I find people interesting and like to gossip (duh, I'm on r/relationships).

However, I don't make a point to interrupt in order to tell this person about things like...I dunno, big life events?  Changes they would be interested in?  The kind of thing that people would hear after the fact and say ""**Why the heck didn't you tell me that when we were talking the other day?**""

That's when you explain why.  ""Sorry, I guess we just got lost in focusing on (insert their issues/monologue here) and I forgot.""

You do appeal to the Lanka though, which, with it's snake maidens and pianos falling out of the sky, may not be the solid argument your faith tells you it is.  Have you read the Lanka?  Did you know that Red Pine argues that there is no original Lanka text?

So, no, there is no chance that Bodhidharma is going to agree with Sawaki.  Sawaki is preaching faith-based Buddhism much like what the Emperor of China was putting his faith in when Bodhidharma put his boot in the Emperor's butt.

.

I'm not interested in defining anything.  ""Zen"" refers to what Bodhidharma's lineage teaches.  I only point out that Soto Buddhism is completely incompatible with Bodhidharma's lineage.  Then I tell people to ""read a book"" if they want to know what Bodhidharma's lineage teaches.  

&gt; for people who associate in someway with the ""Zen"" tradition, whatever that may be. 

Actually, no.  That's just silly.  /r/catfanciers isn't a forum for lion tamers or people who hunt big game cats.  It's not about ""associations"" at all.  

Me pointing out that Soto is a Buddhist tradition and nothing to do with Zen *isn't supposed to add anything to the conversation*.  It's supposed to encourage people to discuss the topic - ***Zen*** - rather than preach about their religion.

.

I get that this forum is going to be tough initially for people who believe what churches tell them.

I'm not sure why you think the solution should be to lump what churches say in with what Zen Masters say.  Where will that end?  If Scientology starts pretending it's Zen too, like Soto Buddhists are doing, do we welcome Scientology too and pretend that Scientologists are also Zen Masters?

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Instant_Game_Collection_games_%28North_America%29

That's 15/24 games that were given away this year. All critically well received. 

I'm not seeing a quality problem. I'm seeing pointless complaining that someone isn't getting $60 Triple-A games for the piddly $30-$50 per year you pay for PS+ on a system that has barely been out a year. 

Also, the PS3 has 8 years of library to draw from for games. It's not even fair to compare when you've got thousands of choices versus tens. Of course you're more likely to get better games on the PS3. 


For reference, Xbox One got a whopping 9 games total in 2014, which such critical darlings as Crimson Dragon and Halo Spartan Assault accounting for about 20% of the selection.  It did get Guacamelee, Super Time Force, and Worms though.

We requested being moved to another unit in the building or breaking our lease early, but neither was granted. They eventually let us leave a month early once we wrote a formal letter to the property management and requested copies of the full work orders for the roach treatment and sent pictures. We ended up throwing out a lot of furniture and paper materials (e.g., vinyl record sleeves, cardboard storage boxes) because we found roach poop and shells in places we didn't see before, until we began moving out. We had to replace a lot of things and paid for a roach treatment at the new place in case we carried over any of those nasty creepy crawlies. In hindsight, we should have pressed on issue with the mold also (which all they did was sand, plaster and paint over), but we were so occupied with the roach issue. Anyways, I digress.

I think it's reasonable to hold off the official marriage until she's pregnant, or if she can't get pregnant in a couple years (as she gradually starts to build a claim against your prior assets, perhaps) to divorce her.  The purpose of traditional marriage is to provide stability and a framework for kids.

It should still be for that, even though no-fault divorce and all the cultural shit has gravely weakened that stability.  Without kids in the picture or expected I don't see the point of legal marriage and would rather swing free.","1420071382"

My roommate was making noise in our unlit kitchen in a large black hoodie, and Chief was whining at my bedroom door to go investigate. I knew it was my roommate who had just gotten home, so I didn't worry about letting him out. He lunged at her barking, but as soon as she said ""Hey Chief!"" he turned his ferocious barking into his whiney greeting he does when anyone gets home. 

Another time we had some thuggish kids walking down our street. Chief was growling at them from the window, in typical GSD fashion, when the kids walked into our front yard and started barking back at him. I put Chief's leash on and opened the front door, mostly just to ask the kids to cut that shit out. Chief *lunged* at them snarling, and they ran off before I could say anything. 

Would Chief had actually followed through with a bite/attack if something (like my roommates voice or his leash) hadn't stopped him? Who knows. I'm not inclined to find out anytime soon. I would rather err on the side of caution and work with my dog *not* to react with his teeth, rather than have him bite someone in a situation where it isn't warranted and he gets himself in some serious trouble.","1420071383"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Sorry it sucks, but it sucks for both parties.

Yeah, but one party has the power to decide by herself whether to keep the child.

And you want to talk about emotional trauma? What about being financially hamstrung for 17 years? And judges sometimes demand more than men can pay. You don't think being forced into poverty could fuck somebody up a bit? God. You people have absolutely no perspective.

I think the crux of the issue is that I think that having sex does not mean consenting to have a child. It means consenting to have sex. You know what constitutes consenting to have a child? When people discuss whether to keep the child, like normal, rational adults do. That's what mature people do, and that's what the law should define as consent. Because it means both parties respecting each other. It means neither party forcing each other to do anything.

**I don't have the right to force you to get an abortion, and you don't have the right to force me to pay. That's how it should be. That's what reproductive rights means. No one is being forced to do anything. We're all making informed decisions without anyone forcing our hand.**

You have mental issues as a result of the abortion? Hey, remember, you took the same risk I did when we had sex. I guess you don't think there should be negative consequences? (And yes, having a baby isn't a negative consequence *if you chose to have the baby.*) Why should the man bear the burden? **You clearly wanted the baby but I didn't want to pay child support. It's not fair that that decision is out of my hands. Just because you're at risk of mental trauma doesn't mean you get to infringe upon my rights. You don't get to command me to do as you please.** Maybe the woman should've thought about the consequences.

And it's telling that you're only talking about how the man should've thought about the negative consequences, and that he bears the responsibility. No perspective.

Fuck you Kubi. I'd say you're the worst route grader the gym has ever had, and you know that's saying something at our gym, but that would imply you do it unintentionally. Starting a long up-and-down route with 4 campus moves is not a 2. A ridiculous leg hook (after a campus start of course) to a tiny crimp match before finishing with a long reach to a sphere isn't a 2. Even someone of your considerable ability should recognize this, so I can only assume you do it because you feel that the people who've progressed to intermediate grades are getting too uppity. You shouldn't be allowed to set anything less than a 4. I shouldn't have to pay $50/mo to put up with someone like you trying to make me feel like shit at the gym.

In our past decade’s wars, as Thomas Ricks wrote in this magazine in 2012, “hundreds of Army generals were deployed to the field, and the available evidence indicates that not one was relieved by the military brass for combat ineffectiveness.” This, he said, was not only a radical break from American tradition but also “an important factor in the failure” of our recent wars.

An uncomfortable topic...but if half the things I've heard about incompetent leaders in the military are true...

I followed Johns videos (8541 Tactical) on his Budget Build and built the EXACT rifle to his specs including the stock... I would go with Bushnell and TPS Rings for sure. I enjoyed the fixed 10x but I wanted more out of my scope.. So I upgraded to Vortex 6-24x50 Viper PST. 

2. GO with the 20MOA Base so that you DO NOT have to change out the base if you ever plan to shoot 700-900+ yards.

3. Bipod - Harris all of the way... Affordable, AMAZING quality and user friendly.. Atlas feels cheap as hell in my hands... I like my Harris.

4. Go with a Bell &amp; Carlson M40 stock, if you can save up some more $$ get a Manners MCS-T4 ($504) 

5. I only clean my precision bolt every 50-100 shots... I let my rifle decide when I should clean it.. My fear is OVER CLEANING it.. But then again.. how often you plan to shoot it will determine how often you should clean it. If I am shooting the rifle on a weekend and putting it away to shoot 4-6 weeks later after that day.. I will clean it.. but for hunting season I only clean it at the end of the season unless it has seen weather.. Remember... When you zero your rifle... Its zeroed under a *Clean, cold bore* so... in turn.. Make sure your barrel is clean when zeroing if you want consistency. 

6. Go with 168gr BTHP's .. Preferrably Sierra Match King.. (Federal Gold Medal Match, Silver State Armory etc)

7. I didnt break in my barrel... Its not needed.

One thing to consider with LR builds... 

THEY ARE EXPENSIVE... I have $4,000 tied up in my .308 AAC-SD right now.. Here are a few pics and a video

American dingos/Carolina dogs are domesticated dogs that went feral (at least i *think* they were domestic) and now populate the eastern part of North and South Carolina; they were mostly captured and now people people breed them as pets and what not. they are not the same as coyotes or wolves though, they are dogs. i assume they are called American dingos because they look like sort of like dingos, which makes sense because dingos kind of look like default-model dogs. i think they are actually recognized by the American Kennel Association now, as their own breed.

i know that sounds weird, believe me i do. but this sounds *exactly* like the kind of thing that would happen in the eastern Carolinas. lowland motherfuckers. Being all trashy...with their mustard BBQ sauce.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","You need 75 materia and Alexandrite total, no matter how you do it.

Each materia melded increases the stat in question by exactly 1 point, no matter what level the materia is. However, you cannot simply spam level 1s. It is set up in tiers, such that i.e. the first 11 Crit materia you meld -must- be level 1, the next 11 -must- be level 2, and so on.

Also, the odds of successful meld go down as you progress through a tier. The first half or so are 100%, then they drop down to as low as 60%.

So, the literal cheapest way to go in terms of tiers (assuming NIN) would be something like 22 ACC, 13 DET, 20 CRIT, 22 SS. If your server is anything like mine though, materia pricing will be all over the place and some Tier 3s are cheaper than Tier 2s of the same kind, etc. So adjust as needed.

If you want a simple way to prepare ahead of time, I would advise you start doing the Ixali beast tribe quests. Once you max them out, you can get 8 or so Ehcatl Sealants, which should sell for a good enough chunk of gil to greatly aid your materia costs.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt; Who would I likely be (Who attended this meeting, how large was it?)

Contemporary letters suggest that up to 500 bishops attended the Council, but based on the actual record of the Council it seems like not every bishop attended every meeting and that some metropolitan bishops voted for bishops under their authority. In Richard Price and Michael Gaddis's recent translation and commentary they suggested a figure of around 370 for attendees with voting rights. There were of course many lower-ranked clergymen also present who either represented absent bishops or were just followers of the people involved. Lastly, there were also several important secular officials who chaired the Council, which necessitated the presence of their followers and guards, a mark of imperial influence made necessary given how messy the Second Council of Ephesus of 449 was. Finally, both Emperor Marcian and Empress Pulcheria briefly visited the Council, so there would have been even more people in and around the meeting during the Council's sixth session.   

As /u/talondearg noted, western representation was practically non-existent apart from the delegation from Rome, which included three bishops from Italy. Only one of them knew Greek, so that means we have to add a whole bunch of translators to our list of attendees too. Four other western bishops were present, one from Pannonia and three (or two) from North Africa, but all of them can be considered to be associated with the eastern Church already and not really representing western interests (the African bishops were probably refugees from the Vandal invasion of Africa for instance). There was also seemingly a bishop from Ethiopia included as part of the Egyptian contingent.

&gt; How diverse were the opinions of those attending the Council re: incorporating the Trinity?

Everyone agreed on the Trinity at the Council. Instead, the debate was over Christology and the political fallout from the two Councils of Ephesus. To put it briefly, Nestorius and his Antiochene allies lost at the First Council of Ephesus thanks the machinations of Cyril of Alexandria and his followers. The former tended to use statements like 'two natures' (human and divine) in their theological writings, whilst the latter preferred formulations of 'one hypostasis and 'one incarnate nature' - basically some form of union between the human and divine natures of Christ. Cyril's own Christology however is also complicated, as he at times was relatively conciliatory towards to the Antiochene position, on other occasions though he was much more dogmatic, so it allowed people of all views to see the dead Cyril as their champion at Chalcedon. Nestorius himself was condemned at Ephesus I for allegedly believing in there being 'two persons' in Christ, but the Antiochene network survived. 

Issues flared up again in the 440s when the Alexandrian party renewed their attack on the Antiochenes, this time led by Cyril's successor Dioscorus. To summarise a very complicated event, Ephesus II ended rather violently as Dioscorus' partisans dominated the proceedings and condemned in harsher terms anything associated with Nestorianism, in the process marginalising the sees of Antioch and Rome. By 451 there was a new emperor on the scene and Dioscorus' influence had weakened, leading some bishops to call for a new council to deal with the mess from Ephesus II. As such, the most prominent factions present at Chalcedon were Dioscorus' allies and those who thought that he had went too far. For various reasons, Dioscorus was condemned at Chalcedon and the Council sought to steer a middle course between two extremes: Eutychianism, an extreme Cyrillian view that denied Christ's humanity altogether and saw him as only of a divine nature, and Nestorianism, the view that Christ existed as two distinct persons. This resulted in the dyophysite position - that Christ had two natures in one person.

&gt; Was there a competing school of thought regarding Jesus' nature which held quite a bit of weight among Council attendees?

Yes, particularly those from Egypt and Palestine who remained loyal to their definition of the Cyrillian Christology, the belief that Christ was both divine and human in one nature (don't ask me to explain why this is different, I'm more of a church politics person!). The Chalcedonian definition on the other hand was acceptable to moderates and partisans of the papacy (as the creed was partially based on a treatise written by Pope Leo the Great). For the influence of those who lost at Chalcedon, we only have to look at Roman history for the next two centuries - non-Chalcedonians, or miaphysites, continuously resisted imperial attempts to impose Chalcedonian candidates on important sees, to the extent that eventually a parallel ecclesiastical hierarchy was established in the sixth century in Egypt and Syria. Some emperors were even sympathetic to the miaphysites, such as Zeno, Anastasius and occasionally Justinian, a trend that reached its apogee during the reign of Heraclius, who sought to reunite the various Churches within his empire even amidst the Arab Conquests, demonstrating the extent of the miaphysites' influence. Egypt, Syria and Armenia in fact would eventually become mostly miaphysite in character, which is true even today for the Coptic, Syriac and Armenian Churches.","1420071394"

"POLITICSINAUSTRALIA","t5_2ywtm","Excerpt from the article by TRISH CORRY
he topic of conversation across many pages on Facebook, across newspaper forums and even current affairs shows has been a statement from ex-ALP Minister Gary Johns

    “Former Labor Minister Gary Johns suggests linking the dole to contraception.”

The comments from a wide and diverse range of people regarding this topic has certainly been an eye opener.

Firstly, I need to get something off my chest….. I find it absolutely remarkable, that an overtly sexist comment from an “Ex-ALP Minister” hits the headlines three days after the polls screamed loudly that Tony Abbott is falling out of favour with women.  Now call me a conspiracy theorist if you like, but I do find that linking an extremely sexist and controversial statement to the ALP three days after polling highlighted that women would rather #putyourironout rather than vote for Abbott again, an attempt at political strategy by the right. #diversion.

John’s originally wrote his article as opinion for The Australian and they labelled John’s as an ‘ex-ALP’ Minister whereas the Australian Newspaper could have labelled him either senior fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA)  (Abbott linked right-wing think tank) or the Associate Commissioner of the Commonwealth Productivity Commission from 2002 – 2004 under the Howard Government.   I find it interesting that the Murdoch press chose to link John’s to the ALP instead, although he hasn’t been a Minister of the ALP and has been critical of the ALP since at least 1996.  The Australian may as well have gone onto social media and asked some random their sexist opinions on welfare and contraception.
