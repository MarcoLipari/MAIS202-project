"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","First up checkout r/keto for some good recipes.

Secondly it is all about what you have in your fridge.

I have sausages, steaks, eggs, cheese, bacon, burgers, cottage cheese, peanut butter, lots of different nuts, protein powder, double cream, coconut oil, spinach, brocolli, cauliflower and cabbage.

You can create some really nice keto foods which taste simillar to the real thing. My favorite is rice, I cut up about 1/4-1/3 of a cabbage into tiny pieces, until they are rice sized (the smaller the better). Then I chuck them in a pan with lots of butter (your call on how much), then I add some salt and pepper a few spices and let it cook until they start turning brown.

The reason you need to keep carbs low is so that your body starts burning fat instead of carbs, basically your body will burn things in this order normally alcohol &gt; carbs &gt; fat. So you want to ensure that your carb and alcohol levels are low enough until you get into ketosis, once you are in ketosis (fat burning mode), you can eat the occasional bit of carbs, if your muscles are depleted of glycogen this is the 30grams per day, if you do lots of hard long training you can up your carbs and have no effect on your ketosis. Same with alcohol except it just basically pauses keto while your body consumes it then it normally just pops right back in.

You could eat tuna fish 3x a day but on keto you really want to eat full fat red meat, this is the most anabolic food, which is best for keeping muscle on if you are cutting with keto and help build more when bulking with it.

Sales and Excise:
[Nevada levies a 6.85% general sales or use tax on consumers, which is above the national median of 5.85%.](http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/42.html)

Property:
[Nevada is one of the 37 states that collect property taxes at both the state and local levels.](http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/42.html)

Do you buy gas or cigarettes? 
[Nevada's gasoline tax stands at 33.1 cents per gallon, which ranks 8th highest nationally. Additionally, Nevada's counties are permitted to levy ""local option"" gasoline taxes. Nevada's cigarette tax stands at 80 cents per pack of twenty and ranks 33rd highest nationally. The sales tax was adopted in 1955, the gasoline tax in 1923 and the cigarette tax in 1947. ](http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/topic/42.html)

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I don't recommend jumping ship. The 18-55 kit lens is **ridiculously sharp** at the 18mm range, even at wide open.

As for upgrading, go for the D300 or D300s first. Until you get some more full-frame (new or old) lenses, your D700 will be limited at every range except at 50mm because of your 50mm f/1.8D.

The D300 will be great for your long exposures because the CMOS sensor doesn't have the weird purple fringing at the corners like the CCD the D40 uses. I've been using my D300s for test exposures of up to 27 minutes long. (Longest time available is about 30 minutes.)

Also, knowing how to do manual focus well will open a gigantic range of great, cheap lenses for you. But if you really want great AF, which is a boom at f/1.8, go for the D300 or D300s first.

Full frame won't be used at its full potential until, like I said earlier, you get some more full frame lenses. Anything without DX or similar labeling will usually be full frame.","1283299285"

I have re-glued many old stile and rail doors that came to me as a pile of sticks after dip stripping. They are never quite the same.

I'm just saying these ""50 amateur writers"" don't represent the new atheists.  The four primary authors DO represent the new atheists.  And if you knew anything about atheists, you'd know that none of them share any beliefs beyond, ""I don't believe in God.""   If he wants to pin these insults on the ""new atheists"" then he must find something that the four primary proponents, or even most of them share.  He hasn't.

&gt;Nothing we know about the brain and the evolution of culture warrants your position. It is just sheer blissful optimism.

Remember, that arguing from a lack of knowledge is exactly what the author is whining so much about.  You seem to know very little about cultural evolution, neuroscience, or modern psychology, or the scientific views of morality.  At the very least, spend a few hours on TEDtalks, and please start informing yourself about the state of the science behind the ""new atheists"" and their actual arguments if you wish to debate these topics honestly.

&gt;I didn't say that it would apply to everyone, but that those kind of people existed.

The author simply wishes that his ""new atheists"" would place themselves in a dour and nihilistic light, in order to somehow ""show their commitment"", as if that somehow changes the strengths of their arguments.

&gt;Religion itself predates moral patterns.
&gt;There is evidence of religion before the homo sapiens walked on Earth.

Citation please, I've never heard this.
Bonobo Apes have been shown to have significant moral reasoning, and even exhibit altruistic behavior.
Only humans have been shown to hold religious views.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8nDJaH-fVE


&gt;Really? Where?

Hitchens in his book God is not Great, and Dawkins in his book, Greatest Show on Earth.
Both talk about the evolutionary roles of religion in many of their lectures and debates.
Which books by the ""four horsemen"" have you read?

NOW.. for the real question, and the only one that really matters...
   Are the ""new atheists"" correct, that religious conceptions of God are simply a figment of believer's collective imagination?
   You'll notice that the article never actually addresses the REAL questions posed by the ""new atheists"".
   He offers no real rebuttal of their arguments, and also offers no attempt to provide compelling evidence for his God. The whole article is simply trying to draw attention away from the real questions.

And that's why my opinion of the author is that he's a whiny douche, because a true gentleman debater will go out of his way to ignore what he ""doesn't like"" about his opponent, and will address the true core of his opponent's argument. ** He simply does not address the real issues presented by the new atheists.**  Instead, he speaks specifically about what he doesn't like about ""them"".","1283299303"

"politics","t5_2cneq","My mind is not made up at all.  I just want you to consider a single data point suggesting government mortgage regulation was a contributing factor the financial crisis.  You've refused to consider said data point because, as you say, you've studied economics extensively (irrelevant to the data point), and the fact that there were other contributing factors (so what?)

You mentioned FHA as the sole relevant housing regulations.  I mentioned CRA, including recent (90's) and relevant amendments.  You've refused to allow this to factor into your own model for the financial crisis.

lesson for you: when you find credible/verifiable data (as mine is) which conflicts with your model (as it does) you have 2 choices: alter/abolish the data, or alter/abolish your model.  Sadly, you've chosen to abolish the data based on the fact that you've studied economics, and there are other data points about the financial crisis.

I never claimed housing regulation as the sole cause, merely a contributing factor.  You claimed FHA to be the only relevant regulation, and asked me to provide you examples of others (which I did).  Other different contributing factors to the crisis does not conflict with my model (that housing regulation was a contributing factor).  Therefore, the only data I would be ""forced"" (as you falsely claim) to dismiss would be data showing that government housing regulation was not a contributing factor at all.  You've failed to provide any such data.  You've even failed to provide any example of what you meant by data I must be dismissing.

In fact, it is you who dismisses data.  Data I provided to you, and repeatedly asked you to consider and either refute, or update your model.  You've done neither.

I hope you can learn from this, 2 lessons from all this so that you may continue to learn and grow your knowledge free from the shackles of pride and arrogance.

  1. never trust arguments from authority

  2. if credible/verifiable data exists, which conflicts with your model, you must alter/abolish your model, not the data.  If your model doesn't fit with reality, it's wrong.  It doesn't matter how smart you are, how elegant or warm and fuzzy your model is, it's wrong.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; You completely missed the point....it just whizzed right over your head.

Disagreeing with you doesn't mean that it whizzed over my head.

&gt; None of that has anything to do with being a ""convict""...it's about them being a bad person.

Convicts have usually done bad stuff which is evidence that they may not be a good person.  I'm all for giving people second chances, but its not out of the question to actually set some boundaries with people who have shown evidence of being less than trustworthy.  For example, not allowing them to stay at your house.

&gt; I repeat, if the guy hadn't of been caught....would you be cool with him then?  In that case he wouldn't be a convict.

No, but that's irrelevant to the discussion.  In both cases we're discussing a known convict.  And the consensus is that the fact that those people are a convict makes them less trustworthy.  Your assertion is that these people may be good people who just made a bad decision.  That may be the case.  I'm certain there are plenty of people out there.  Still doesn't mean that they immediately deserve high levels of trust, such as levels allowing them to stay in your home with your children, when there is evidence that they are not good people.

&gt; I'm not going to defend what my friend did...of course it's wrong.

Yes, and its evidence of him not being an entirely good person.  You may think that he's a good person who made one mistake, and that may certainly be the case.  I've also known people who made mistakes, their friends swore up and down that they were good people, and they turned out to be bad people.  I'd say that the fact that your friend was caught stealing stuff warrants some caution in certain situations.

&gt; I would point out that he's not stealing stuff from people....he was shoplifting small items from stores.

Stores are owned by people.  He was stealing from people.

&gt; That's clearly not a ""victim-less"" crime...but it's very different than taking peoples personal belongings.

Perhaps in impact to the people in question, but its still stealing from people.

&gt; I'm not saying that's ok...of course it's not.....

Good, because it sure seemed like  you were trying to heavily downplay it.

&gt; but there was a lot of other stuff involved. It's not like he just did it for giggles, 

You said he did it for the thrills, so I don't think you can blame me for my confusion.

&gt; he was struggling to deal with a lot of stuff and ended up picking a bad way of doing it.

Its regrettable that he was dealing with ""a lot of stuff,"" but other people may not have that context.  Its unreasonable to expect people to disregard any evidence of your friend's lack of trustworthiness because he was ""going through a lot of stuff.""  People like your friend should get an opportunity to build back up that trust, but I'm not going to apologize for being careful to not allow your friend into a situation where he can repea

&gt; The point is he's a decent guy who did something bad....have you never done anything bad? Are you beyond reproach or something?

I have done bad things, yes.  Usually they required for me to rebuild trust that has been broken.  People did not treat me in the same way, and I had to work hard to get to a point where they did.  It would be unreasonable of me to expect them to treat me the exact same way when I have given them solid evidence that they should not trust me.

&gt; The point is, he is now a ""convict"" and soon to be former convict....but that fact doesn't give you much to go on in terms of what sort of person he is.

Granted, but it is evidence.  People should have a chance to explain themselves and rebuild their reputation.  But when dealing with imperfect information, sometimes people have to make decisions.  Being a convict is evidence that someone has done something bad, and that affording them a constricted level of trust may be warranted.

&gt; There are lots of people who were sent to jail for minor offenses, or stuff they didn't do.

Yes, its imperfect, which is why ""second chances"" are important.

&gt; There's lots of criminals who did bad stuff, but have now reformed.

Yes, which is why ""second chances"" are important.  That's not a reason to grant full trust immediately upon release.  

&gt; Your anecdotal story means nothing, except you met one guy who was a jerk but seemed nice....

My story was meant to illustrate that, despite people claiming that someone else is nice or reformed and should be trusted, doesn't mean they actually are.  Tons of mothers of thugs think that their babies are angels. Tons of friends will swear up and down that their convict friends are actually really good guys.  It doesn't mean its true.

It doesn't mean its false either.  Which is why I explicitly said that people should be able to rebuild their reputation.  But what I'm also saying is that some level of caution is warranted.  Letting a convict stay in your house?

&gt; it has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

It has everything to do with what we're talking about.  You're upset that people are emphasizing that he's a convict, and brought up an andicdotal story about your friend who is a convict but a good guy, and then extrapolating that people should let the convict thing slide.  I'm bringing up a story about a convict who people said was a good guy who really wasn't, showing that caution is warranted.","1283299375"

Going multi-processor won't net you too much I guess ... and is just gonna be a pain if you are using traditional threads....  On the other hand, trying to find an app that fits the GPU's very special and very limited programming model is gonna be difficult.  ... but I guess you know all of that.

Maybe GraphicsMagick? http://www.graphicsmagick.org/index.html

... or maybe some form of graphics processing library that you can set an algorightm/filter and have it run it on all the pixels in the GPU.

... or if you are really good at this... various physics simulations projects

Chivalry is about following rules to protect the weak, and weak use to mean female.

- The guy in the Harley shirt is an idiot and should be patted on the head, then ignored.

- The guy on the greenscreen was right until towards the end when he made the seperation between black christians and white christians.

We are humans floating around space on a ball of rock and iron.

I hate the term 'nigger'. I hate when black people use it. I hate when white people use it. Black people seem to use it as an empowerment tool while 90% of the time, when white guys say it, it's derogatory.

Mostly, I just consider it uncivilized. We've done enough genetic archaology to determine that aside from skin pigment, we've got the exact same organs, brains, and DNA as everyone else.

I believe in equality regardless of race, sex, or religion. I also believe in free speech which means allowing idiots their right to speak. Let them talk, then let the public voice call them out for their stupidity.

They should be allowed to use the word nigger. It doesn't mean they should be using that word however since it's offensive to civilized thought. We're all the same.","1283299395"

Not that the station needs to be sold and the only problem is to find a good owner.

The R/D for this plane was astronomical, which was to be offset by the high number of planes in production.

Also, the F-35 is not a replacement for the F-22 (just like the F-16 is not a replacement for the F-15). They serve two completely differing roles.

The F-35 is meant to be a low-cost, modular, multi-force, coalition funded airframe. In which the same general components can be stocked by multiple nations, lowering the cost of maintenance, because damn near anywhere a plane is landed the parts to fix it will be there. Also, its flexibility and adaptability in combat will be of use to commanders. For instance, there are 4 Navy F-35s on a carrier (equipped with carrier hooks), but shit's popping in this area and the Marines could use a few VTOL aircraft. A few weeks downtime and the right parts, those Navy F-35s can be converted (that is, if the weight issues with the Marine's VTOL F-35 get straightened out - last I heard it was damn near going to be scrapped).","1283299432"

* #3 combines many great aspects including meme-worthy, reddit alien, and eye catching design.  
* #4 is nice in a minimalist sort of way with a hint of alien and a pin striped suit
* #5 just doesn't work for me:  Too orangered or something.  
* #6 I think is great for a new look, very unique, very bold.  
* #7 makes me want to trace around the maze around the alien and maybe that just catches my interest but it could be universal.  It caught my eye.  
* #8 is like the beautiful subdued girlfriend.  Hotter than hell but sitting in the corner reading a book you'll never understand.  But waiting.  
* #9 though it doesn't use new colors it puts them together in a way that one doesn't often see on reddit.  This could work well because it's like seeing a dude sleep with a horse.  Sure, it happens, but when you actually _see it_ you can't help but look.

If you've decided simply that you don't think that marriage as an institution is worthwhile, as long as your partner is on board, it's fine.

I'm generally a fan of Google and they've done a lot of good, but they aren't a ""product"" company.  Google doesn't know how to build products in the same way Apple or even Microsoft does.   Instead Google has cool ideas and partially executes on them.  Then it seems like their Engineers get bored and move on to other stuff.  There are certainly exceptions to this (e.g. Maps and Chrome), but much of their stuff seems half-baked from a product perspective.  Even Gmail, which was brilliant in 2004, is now getting incredibly long in the tooth and suffering from new features being crudely bolted onto its interface.   Apple by contrast is clearly focused on the user's experience with their products - form doesn't simply follow function, form is an equal partner with function and so enhances it.  That doesn't make Apple perfect far from it, but the focus on ""product"" is clearly there.  For Google, important simple functionality is sometimes bizarrely missing for no discernable reason and ""form"" means nothing at all.    

FWIW, I use Gmail exclusively, Google Calendar exclusively, use Chrome exclusively unless I want Firebug or Netflix, use Google Voice, prior to dropbox all my shared documents were Google Docs, and I just switched from iPhone to Samsung Galaxy S.  ","1283299598"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","After being essentially raped my first few years of college on textbooks that I couldn't sell back if they where the last books on earth I have used the following plan of action. It has not failed me yet.

1. Make sure you absolutely need the book for the class, after the third time I bought a book the Professor never used I was done. Always wait until the second week of class to purchase the book, so you know that you absolutely need it. 
 
2. If you can find the text book online for cheap (and you can afford it) buy it online, proceed to highlight crap out of it for fun. Draw mutaches on the serious business pictures, if you must. If you can't, proceed to step 2.

3. Ask the professor if you can use the previous edition, most Professors have no control over the text book updates in their class. Most professors will also let you use the previous edition if it contains small changes (chapters moved around, different blurbs) but the core content remains the same. The old edition is always ultra cheap online used. If that is not the case . . . 

4. Ask the Professor to put the book in the library for referance, this has not failed me. The Professor will always put a book on reserve if you ask, they get extras from the publisher. If the Professor refuses, use WorldCat from your school library home page to search for other area college that have the textbook. Sometimes you can do an inter library loan, or just go to the college and do your work there. However, this takes a few days as does getting a used copy mailed to you. So . . . 

5. When you need to do readings/assignments the first week, the first chapter of a textbook will 95% of the time be available on the Publisher's website. If your college text book store is located in the college bookstore (a place with a cafe) go and ""rent"" the book for as much time as you need to take notes the first week. I usually just pick it up from the shelves, sit down with it and put it back when I'm finished.

This way, I get my work done while waiting for used/old editions to be shipped or waiting on the professor to put the book in for referance. I do the vast majority of my work in a library in either way, so this method always worked for me since I was there anyway. I only had to visit another college's library one semester (I went 4 times) to read the book because it was on reserve and make copies. ","1283299598"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't think you can look at patents without considering monetary concerns because that's what they're *for*. The original purpose of a patent was to reward the first developer of a product protection for the time/effort/cost they have invested in developing the product. However the current use of patents appears (again, IMO) to be rampant trolling for cash. e.g.

* 1. create one product
* 2. patent as much as you possibly can 
* 3. spend the rest of your life raping the shit out of anyone who even comes close to your patent.
* 4. profit

Since suing for patent infringement is a viable source of income for the company, I would say this reduces innovation; the original company doesn't need to, and any new companies can't for fear of infringing a patent.

If patents didn't exist, how would you protect the time/effort/cost you have invested in developing your product? Is there any way you could do this without creating the conditions we have now?","1283299660"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Of course you're right... Inflated egos are extremely hard to burst.  

It does happen though and with almost universally positive results.  An inflated ego is a person's worst enemy.

I do still think that honesty is the best approach here.  The important things to communicate would be: 

*  I was genuinely trying to be nice and helpful and you put me down which is extremely rude
*  Being a dumb ungrateful bitch isn't a good thing
*  Being a smart competent helpful person *is* a good thing
*  Regardless of all your time in the sun talking to real friends about real issues you're a pretty lousy friend

I'll admit.. the likely results will simply be more ego protection but.... if you are kind, but persistent you will probably provoke some extreme behaviors because life is full of moments when reality wounds people's ego.  A persons normal reaction is to sweep that data under the rug.. to forget it, minimize it, explain it away and ignore it.  

Don't let them.  

Take the opportunity to emphasize their failure, explicitly draw the conclusions that their ego defense would prevent them from drawing and simply, without malice, sate them.  If she gets in a car accident simply say it's ok to make a mistake,  not everyone is a good driver.  Fails a test?  Not everyone's smart, at least she's not retarded, and lots of people are too lazy to study.  Punctuate the moments where reality clashes with her ego and simply and clearly point out the truth of the situation watch the fun of an ego flailing wildly to protect itself from reality.

Or if you really cant stand her.. stroke that ego like mad.  Nobody ends up quite as miserable as someone with an enormous ego and nothing to back it.","1283299676"

The scammer's follow up was to claim that the person with the keys was in a major car accident before she could mail them.  They also had the audacity to request financial assistance for the medical bills in order to hasten the mailing of the keys.

I'm glad to see you still want to retain the rights over a woman's body.

&gt;Murder and rape are punishable by death. Prisons serve only ""vitaloaf"", with no TV, no internet, no weight lifting, no radio, no music, but books would be okay. Prison is not fun, recreational time. It is prison, and should be treated as such. It should really, really suck, so no one ever wants to go back. No time off for good behavior. No treating celebrities like something special. They all go to the same jails.

Because jails are such wonderful and loving places right now.  Like Disney Land really if you think about it.

&gt;Stealing results in the theif working for minimum wage, per hour, for the person who they stole from, cleaning the house, the car, doing the yard, until they pay for what they stole.

Minimum wage?  You support the minimum wage?  Having the big bad government force employers to pay it's employees a minimum wage won't earn you any points here.  And if I catch someone stealing from me the last thing I want is to have them around my business.

&gt;Teachers, firemen, police officers, and the army would all get paid more.

Second, Obama really doesn't need to give the neo-cons more ammo to go after him.  They already invent enough shit as it is.  They'd have a field day if he came out and said what the real repercussions of this war were.

So while I wish Obama would tell the truth, I can't really fault him for towing the line.  I think he has a lot more to lose from being honest than he does to gain.  And that's the bigger problem.","1283299727"

You paid the bill. The owner got his money, the cooks can be paid their flat rate wages along with all the rest of the back of house staff. All the people who you never saw and never had any reason to interact with you are taken care of.

You don't tip, all the people who made a personal and public effort to help you have a nice evening get screwed. The server, obviously, does not get paid for the work they just performed. The busser, runner, and bartender (some restaurants also tip out hostesses) still have to get tipped out by the server, at which point he's paying out of his own pocket to tip them for their efforts in assisting him and lost money in serving you. They get a percentage of his sales (usually around 5%)

Here's what you do if you do not like the system but also do not want to screw over an individual, the one side of the coin that is on your side (as a server, we're on your side, you're our boss, you pay us more than the restaurant, we'd  rather keep you happy than our boss so long as we aren't requested to do things that would get us fired).

Speak with the manager and explain that you aren't going to pay the bill as described for whatever, they'll usually take an item or two off, then still leave a tip that would have been the proper percentage of the original bill.

That way the owner/manager gets the message, the people that need to hear your message against the system. The server still gets a living wage. Make sense?","1283299741"

No, no argument. That's why, if you look, people are saying ""you're stupid for having done things this way."" :-)

&gt; I'm not clear about your modality here.

I mean if you're running ""check for new mail"", and your mail store for some reason can only be accessed by one thread at a time, having the GUI be ""responsive"" during that time can be problematic. Either there's really not a lot you can do while you're checking, or you wind up breaking things because you have multiple threads flailing on the store. *Everything* has to be asynchronous and threadable, not just the UI libraries and the network libraries. 

&gt; programmers might have forgotten to show that emergency Cancel button

I'm saying there were, for a time, network operations on shared drives that could not be canceled once started. Hence, if you (for example) opened an explorer window on a share that was slow, it became unresponsive because there was no way to stop accessing drives. This (according to Wikipedia) was fixed in Vista, allowing synchronous I/O to be canceled. (Note that synchronous I/O includes normal read and write calls to network-shared drives, so something like ""dosomething.exe &gt;\\server\share\output.txt"" would wind up hanging until the I/O timed out.)","1283299750"

&gt;If you call someone a fag with the intent to insult them, then it's very reasonable to assume you have a problem with ""fags"".

Inductive reasoning doesn't always lead to a correct conclusion, but that's hardly a novel concept. 

I don't have a problem with most gay people (and if I have a problem with them, it's certainly not because they're gay), I have a problem with people who attempt to make me feel guilty when I have every right to say what I want to say, or think what I want to think. Actually, come to think of it, *I don't* have a problem with those people. They are the ones with the problem. 

&gt;Words like faggot and gay (when used as an insult) hit a nerve for some of us because they encapsulate that horrible feeling--that you have less value in the eyes of society because of your orientation--into a single word.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've been boycotting a Burger King close to my apartment for the past 2 years. All because of a packet of ranch. 

Here's the story for anyone who cares.

Me and a friend went to Burger King, I ordered my food, and my friend ordered his, even asked for Ranch while he was ordering the food. The cashier said no worries and he would give it to my friend once the food was ready.

The food is now ready and we go to pick it up off the counter, no Ranch, so my friend politely asked for Ranch, was then told he had to pay .50 cents for the packet. My friend is getting upset because he had originally asked for Ranch. (Paying for the Ranch would have be no problem if it was included when he had ordered his food.) The manager came up, and told him he would have to pay for the Ranch. We tell the manager that we had originally asked for Ranch, he asks the cashier and the cashier tells him we never said anything. At that point, I became upset. (Yes I know its just Ranch, this was more about how they are willing to piss off two paying customers over 50 cents.)

So my friend pays for the Ranch with his credit card. (I'm pretty sure Burger King has to pick up the processing charge, which is probably .45 cents. Anyone able to confirm?)

So effectively, THAT Burger King lost two customers all over .50 cents. I frequent a different Burger King now, just waiting for the previous Burger King to close down to reopen as another In-n-Out. (I'm hopeful.)","1283299826"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I work out 6 days a week. Sunday is my rest day where I do not step foot in the gym (unless its to play some basketball or relax in the pool ;]).
Every other day I work out upper body, days in between I work out lower body. I do 15 minutes of abs every work out day.

Upperbody: 7 sets of bench, 4 sets of shoulder, 4 sets of triceps, 4 sets of forearms, 4 sets of back. I do my back exercises in between my first 4 sets of bench. I alternate days of heavy bench (high weight low rep) and light bench (low weight high rep)

Lower Body: 7 sets of squat OR 7 sets of deadlift (depending on what day it is, I alternate squat and deadlift days), 4 sets of quad machine, 4 sets of calf raises, 4 sets of good mornings, and 3 sets of weighted lunges.

But this is what *I* do (I'm a power lifter).

To fit your goals, you should probably only hit bench/deadlift/squat for 5 sets. and do half an hour or hour of cardio in the morning and then do weight lifting later in the day when you have time. :]

My weight lifting workout takes me about an hour and a half if I take good long breaks. Other than that, (if I'm in a rush) I can get it all done in an hour and 10 minutes.

Hope this helps!

I would see if there are any rescues that could courtesy list her for you. Basically they would list her on their website and could screen applicants. They have a lot more knowledge about weeding out bad potential adopters than most people. You may have to foster her or find someone to foster her until someone adopts her.

Has your roommates dog been known to show aggression towards cats?

Also, most ""no-kill"" shelters will euthanize on occasion, just not as often as ""kill shelters"". The name is misleading.

I hope you find someone to take the cat. ","1283299901"

After two months - she started to move on - and I decided that I thought I had made a mistake.  So I came back and told her I could wait a while - but not to long.  After about four months she said she was ready. She got a second proposal...

We we together 3 1/2 years before we got married - 10 months ago.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Your argument would make sense if there really was such a free market in the Android store, but right now it is heavily distorted:  Google is in some sense effectively coercing many devs into developing apps for gratis because they do not allow devs from most countries to sell paid apps on the market.    So if you are a developer from any one of dozens of major countries around the world and you want to be involved in Android your *only* option right now is to put apps on the market for free and figure out some other channel to make money out of it.  (Or not make money at all, but hope Google fixes the market situation soon, which is what I think most devs are doing right now).

So there is no such undistorted market of supply and demand for free apps, there is an oversupply of Free and Crap and an undersupply of Good and Paid.   This in turn, I think, is translating into a lack of trust and confidence in the store generally (people find that nearly all the apps they install turn out to be crap, so they are unwilling to pay for paid ones based on fear of an awful experience).","1283299912"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Organic farming is also already in place, it never was ""out of place"", people have been doing this for centuries. That is gives lower yields is simply not true, there's no ""burden of proof"" there. It's just a bunch of people who have little to do with farming *assuming* it does, for no reason. And like you they are unable to provide a reason why it would when asked. You already got a bunch links disproving this anyway.

If you want to talk labour cost, of course organic food tends to have more labour cost. But that has nothing to do with *sustainability*, unless you forecast the disappearance of human labour in the future. Mechanized farming *is* about substituting labour with fossil carbohydrates and phosphates (and guv'ment subsidies) so that's hardly a surprise!

Since the price for these substitutions has historically been low, it's been cheaper. We all know the price of these will go up, so in comparison good soil use, human labour, etc will become relatively cheaper again. 

You may think this is not an immediate problem, but you'll probably keep thinking that till it's already a problem. 

In any case there's no problem with organic farming either, and it's already in place too, so I don't see a problem with people purchasing and consuming organic food. It only grows this sector, which brings economies of scale, and investment and innovation that will not just be immediately useful, but in the future too.

So, continue to eat all the factory food you want. Just remember that when you do something, it doesn't make what other people do ""unsustainable"". We'll buy pesticide free food grown by people who make use of methods (and human labour) that grow a decent amount of food on land where in the future this same method can still be applied on the same land. And you can buy chemically infused food grown by people that use carbohydrates and phosphates acquired through dubious geopolitics to grow a decent amount of food on land in a way that will require ever more of these materials (which are set to become ever more expensive) to get the same decent amount.

That is the typical arrangement, and that percentage can be like 40-50%, so it costs dearly if you don't make weight, and most fighters would rather take their chances with cutting weight than hand over half their paycheck to their opponent/enemy.  

But things get complicated when there are titles on the line too.  If you don't make weight for a championship bout, you can still fight, but you will probably be fighting at a 'catch-weight' or simply as a non-title fight with a *dramatically* reduced purse.   

Picking a weight class, lining up a fight, training, all take months.  It is not so easy to just decide to get heavier or lighter.

Maybe they support the [Jack Herer California Cannabis &amp; Health Initiative 2012](http://www.jackherer.com/initiative.html) instead. Maybe they predict negative societal consequences with Prop19 that other users just don't see (or that other users figure they could live with as long as they could buy cheap weed).

Jack Herer spoke out against Prop19 before his death. Dennis Peron opposes Prop19 and called it ""thinly veiled prohibition."" That's two notable cannabis consumers right there.

If Prop19 fails, it's not the end of the road. To get on a ballot in CA, an initiative needs 434K signatures. If Prop19 passes and it turns out to be a disaster, it may very well be the end of the road, all over the US. ""Baby steps"" in this case means marijuana prohibition will *still* exist. You get all the bad that comes with prohibition, plus all the bad that could come from Prop19.","1283300025"

I have seen five clients in the 8-10yr old range start hearing voices and seeing things that weren't there (shadows and such). We cut out scary movies, it went away. It's not because scary movies are bad, its just that kids don't have the capacity for certain kinds of abstract thought and the images stay with them. The game thing I worry a little less about. She's interacting with it and making things happen. She's in control for much of it. Or at least has some control. A movie, is something that happens to you. 

Btw, when I say they started hearing voices I don't mean they developed schizophrenia. I knew they hadn't because the voices were isolated to when they were alone.

I don't carry openly most of the time, and the ostentatious displays of firearms in the manner you mention would not occur were statists of every stripe not trying as hard as they are to abolish the right completely.  The very idea that we should cater to an infantile, irrational mindset which thinks there's a fundamental difference to their quality of life because one hides or displays a firearm is ludicrous, just as the idea that we ""shouldn't express controversial opinions"" even though we have them, because someone might get their panties in a bunch is.

I get your point: open carry does raise hackles.  My point is that in a free country, people better get used to having their hackles raised.  That's the price of a free and pluralistic society.  And it is a bigger, and no less crucial debate if you measure the right to keep and bear arms against the larger idea of liberty.

Open carry and Islamic Centers built on private property near ground zero it is.  People who don't like it really ought to consider living somewhere else where their delicate sensibilities and constant fear of their fellow man is assuaged by the nanny state they so badly want.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Ahah, actually, I answered the question, ""Can god create an object so large even he cannot move it?"" The answer is yes, and I have not heard, nor anybody given me any evidence otherwise, that anybody has ever answered it in this way before.

The question is not invalid, and I show that. Most people ask the question thinking it cannot be answered without disproving part of the question, but I showed there is an answer that does just that. Here it is rephrased:

1)      Can god create an object so large even he cannot move it?

The answer given above is yes. To disagree, please provide what way the following proof is inaccurate and give an alternative:

a)      Definition: god is omnipotent (omnipresent as well).
b)      Definition: god can create matter anywhere out of nothing.
c)      Action: god creates matter everywhere he exists / in all space.
d)      Analysis: there is nowhere left to move the object, thus…
e)      Conclusion: god can create an object so large that he cannot move it.

It is a very logical progression given omnipotence that does not limit god in any way.","1283300086"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Absolutely no down votes for an intelligent conversation :)
I think that's a good point, but it's also one that I've thought a lot about.

What's happening right now, is that hard working, tax-paying people are paying for the education of these people's children. That's not right on any level. If you want to pay for these people's children, there is nothing stopping you. In fact, if you wanted to pay for these people beyond what you already do in taxes, you can go ahead and cut them a check for whatever you think you would like to donate to them. A change towards a free market in education won't stop you from taking what you *used* to pay in taxes and just give it to them. The only difference is that you won't be *forced* to donate to them if you don't want to. You see? Options are great! Lower taxes and free markets can please *everyone*, even the most tax-loving liberals, because if they want to pay more taxes/donations, they certainly are *free* to. 
But you and I both know that that's not what the liberals want. The liberals want to take money out of *your* pocket, not their own. That is what we call *theft*. A libertarian government will reveal people's true motives, because everybody gets to put their money where they want it, and everyone's vote counts. 
Does this make sense? If not, let me know where I can be more clear.

I think your only remaining question is, ""well what if no one steps up and pays for these kids' education? What if nobody donates to them?""
Then I would say a couple of things:
1. There are many good causes that don't get donated to. That doesn't mean that I will reach into your pocket and steal your money to donate to them.
2. In this case it looks like the liberals didn't really want to take care of the poor, did they? Sure, they claimed to, but when push came to shove they were gone.
2. I could have done my entire four years of high school in one year. If anyone is truly determined, they can too. One year of schooling isn't that expensive. There are special circumstances that need special consideration, yes, but I'm talking about most people's situations.
3. There are ways to apply free market principles without leaving these kids in the dust. We can have loans that the kids can pay back, much like college. Do you have any other ideas here? ","1283300114"

The lot is so small that sometimes people have to wait or go find parking elsewhere, hence the fee which I think is 3$ because it's so close to the 3rd street promenade.

Arousal and sexual play is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system (the part of the brain that controls your digestive system and calming you down. Think ""rest and digest""), and this is what allows for him to get an erection. 

In order to orgasm/cum, however, he must have a sympathetic response (The agonist system which controls your 3Fs ""fighting, fleeing, and fucking""). 

This means that you are doing nothing wrong. You're engaging him and hes loving it, but inorder to make him cum he must access that more primal agressive side of his sexuality that will put him in the sympathetic state of mind. You can help him achieve this, of course, or he could try to find it himself (not like playing around with his response wont be fun :P)

tl;dr : If he's very relaxed throughout the whole thing he wont be able to cum. He must engage his sympathetic response.","1283300209"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;""This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option: there is insufficient data and the proposition has not yet been proven to be either true or false.""

So after 50 years or so that dynamic languages have been around you're saying there's insufficient data to decide whether they are in fact significantly more error prone?

&gt;I was a professional Smalltalk developer for 10 years - now perhaps you could try and answer the question.

Sure, creating mixed data types, say I want something like the following in Haskell:

    data Person = Person {
          age :: Int
        , income :: Double
        , name :: String
    } deriving (Eq,Show)

I have to create a data type, figure out what it inherits, how it fits in the type hierarchy, etc. In Clojure I can just put the data in a map:

    {:age 21, :income 25.0, :name ""John Doe""}

I don't need to do any extra ceremony around the data. A lot of real world data is mixed, and if you have to create specific types each time you have a new data type it becomes old pretty fast. With a dynamic language like Clojure, I have list, vector, map, and set, and these are reusable data structures that I can rely on majority of the time. To me that alone helps productivity immensely.

I guess I might just be lucky to work in such a new facility, or in a state that isn't plagued by rampant corruption, but I really believe that we've learned a lot since then.

A lot of people don't realize that there are just a TON of rehabilitation programs that can educate inmates on substance abuse problems, help them deal with mental illnesses, teach them how to be better parents, how to hold a job. They can even get jobs which involved skilled labor, as in things they can one day put on a resume. The problem is, a number of the inmates in our care don't want to participate in those programs for whatever reason. Sometimes it's even to the point where a good program will lose funding because it's perceived as ineffective since nobody is participating. I mean, what can we do? We can't FORCE them to be better people.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","&gt; Medical problems are often complicated, and someone without a medical background may jump to false conclusions

Someone with a medical background often does jump to false conclusions up to and beyond the point where you are in the emergency room.

My mother complained about what she suspected was a heart condition for years.  Eventually, after a few years, they gave her a diagnostic device to wear, and ruled out a heart condition.  Then, not too long later, she was in the emergency room with issues related to her heart.

&gt; Many patients arrive at a visit with print outs of information about new pills on the market or a condition they think they may have developed.

&gt; “It’s great that patients are becoming more informed,” she said. “However, it becomes a concern when people come in and think they know more about a condition than the doctor. 

I know for a fact that after spending days researching a condition on the internet in most cases you _will_ know more about it than a non-specialist in that area.

That isn't the problem.  The problem is incorrectly self-diagnosing with that condition you have researched so well.  Obviously having a major surgery on the basis of self-diagnosis is ridiculous and that baseball player's physicians should never have done that.

My own experience: I have always taken asthma medication, complained to doctors in recent years about how bad it was at nighttime when I lay down.  Switched medications, still having severe problems breathing when sleeping or lying down, still complaining to doctors.

Eventually I found some information on the internet.  The doctors had not once given me even a little hint of the possibility this might be related.  My main problem is GERD, related to something structural, either the valve at the bottom of my esophagus not closing or a hiatus hernia or both.  When I sit up or raise the head of my bed, sleep on my left side and take acid reducers, all of those things improve my breathing and sleep at night or when I lay down.

Clauderoughly gave you some great ideas about the blowjob thing. I'd like to just bring up a few ideas that are more about your sex life together in general.

&gt;  I was extremely sexually active before we were married, she was a virgin.

The (possibly incorrect) impression I get is that your wife may be very shy about her sexuality. However you proceed, you know you're going to have to be very clear to her that there's nothing wrong with her and she does not need to be fixed. 

Another thing that comes to mind is that you may have been treating her with kid gloves for five years, now, and it may be time for both of you to understand that she won't break. If she's still really shy in the bedroom after five years, you may have to do that more-experienced-partner thing and start helping her come up to speed.

&gt; I'm not into pleading, begging or whatever

Very smart.

&gt; I want her to feel safe.

This, also, is commendable. Good going. Not everyone who posts a problem here feels so kindly toward their SO.

&gt; It's not worth her feeling degraded/used/objectified [...]

Are these her words? Is this specifically about swallowing or otherwise dealing with semen, or is this a more general attitude she has about sex? If it's the latter, I would strongly recommend couple's therapy, preferably with someone whose area of expertise is sex. You can probably get past a ""semen is icky"" situation on your own but if it's bigger than that, an expert can be extremely valuable.

&gt; She wants to please me and I appreciate that

This is solid. Remember there are an awful lot of married guys out there who *never* get blowjobs, or for whom the blowjobs stop after the wedding ceremony. Your girl is still game, five years in, and that speaks *volumes* about the quality of your relationship.

Okay, now for a few non-theoretical ideas. Use the ones that strike your fancy and ignore the ones that don't. This is a shotgun approach because I don't have a lot of detail on your sexual adventure together except for your frustration about the blowjob situation, so a lot of this stuff may not be applicable.

* Print out two copies of [this sexual inventory](http://www.greatsexgames.com/podcast/documents/sexualinventory.pdf), then, in separate rooms, you each fill them out, then compare and discuss. This will give you a good idea of what kinds of things you're each willing to do or try for the other. The advantage of using this form is that it is independent of your particular taste, so it won't come across as having your agenda stamped all over it. You can also have fun laughing together at the crazy stuff other people do.

* Set aside an evening or three just for touching each other without the expectation of sex.

* At least half the time, try together not to have a goal during sex, i.e. orgasm. Just enjoy bringing each other physical pleasure.

* Does she masturbate with any regularity? If not, you need to encourage her to begin doing so. The point is for her to learn what she likes so she can be more comfortable with her own body and also so she can guide you.

* Toys. My favorite Reddit comment about sex toys went something like ""going from toyless to toyful sex is like going from dialup to broadband internet."" There's some truth in that. If you don't already have a Hitachi Magic Wand, get one. They're less than $40 from Amazon, last time I checked. A small bullet vibe should also be in your toy box; they are amazing fun during sex. Spend some time together looking at the selection at babeland.com. They were founded by women and so aren't as threatening-looking as a lot of online sex toy stores. Also they have excellent demo videos you can laugh at together.

* Keep the fires burning constantly. By this I mean letting her know you desire her all the time, not just when you're in the bedroom. My sweetie really likes getting flirty text messages from me during the work day, for example.

* I mentioned flavored lube before. I haven't gotten around to trying them but the H2O brand gets good marks.

Hope this helps.","1283300383"

I know people love knocking IE 6 but if you compare it with browsers of the time, such as say Mozilla 0.9 or so, it really was the only reasonable option as long as you could run it on your OS.

But I'll believe Thorium is viable when I see it work. Remember that in the 50s/60s there were plenty of scientist (with and without nobel prizes) telling us conventional nuclear would provide all the energy we ever need for almost no cost.

The trick to a relationship is that it should make you happier and less stressed. When it is making you either more unhappy or more stressed, then it's time to either change it or drop it. Sounds like drop it time.

Also, um, some girls want to be handled roughly and told what to do. I dunno if she's one of those, but may be. If so, don't be all gentle and shit with her, it will cause her no sexual pleasure to be all cutesy and shit. Be rough, be firm, tell her who is boss. Of course, this only counts if she's like that, and I'm pretty much just projecting my last relationship onto yours.

You know the look. 

The heavy-lidded, slightly bored, condescend-to-the-world-look. I live in the city and often go do things on my own and sometimes at night, so it helps then to look bitchy. Otherwise you get hit on, followed, or otherwise made to feel like meat.  

When white people get to know me, they confide that I'm not as intimidating as I look.

* feints - really good players have gotten this down. You start attacking but halfway through the animation, you use R-mouse to start a block and immediately swing again. It fakes out a lot of players. You seemingly ""swing faster"" to new players.

* short bows allow for fast clean shots but typically take 2-3 shots for a kill. Warbows and longbows can do the job in 1-2 hits but fire off a lot slower. They can however be rediculously accurate at long range. In a range on range fight strafe a lot, draw string, stop a second to dodge their shot, THEN fire.

* when gaining ground on an opponent (running away) use the titled key (squiglly line under esc) to look around without slowing down.

* with a crossbow and good timing you can kill a shield blocker as he takes his first swing at you

* DO NOT shoot into a melee fight at long range. Even at short range, ONLY shoot if the fighters back away from each other. A lot of ranged users kill their allies taking risky shots.

* if you meet BKS or POM guild members, ranged weapons are typically the best way to kill them. They have been playing for months and have the best melee skills. They'll typically kill half a team in a round. 

* if someone puts their weapon above their head it means they want to engage in a clean, 1v1 duel. If 2 people do it to each other, honor their agreement and watch.","1283300445"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;Which would of course increase burden on public assistance programs. Not necessarily a bad idea, but how far can it really be taken?

Yeah, I don't know a perfect solution re: personal responsibility for children vs. reducing reliance on welfare.  I go back and forth on this one myself.

However, given that we make noncustodial parents pay child support, as opposed to random people off the street, it's pretty clear that there is already a 'cause and effect' relationship considered when determining who pays child support for whom.  And if two people make an agreement that one of them will use birth control, one person should not be able to change the agreement without notifying the other partner.  I think it's similar to insurance--if I make an agreement to buy car insurance from Geico, Geico can't decide to stop insuring me and not tell me about it, while I continue to make payments.

&gt;Would you support a similar way to disclaim responsibility for a woman who didn't want to have an abortion, in the case that the man was compromising the integrity of condoms or had lied about having a vasectomy?

I think the woman can already do an adoption if she doesn't want to have an abortion and doesn't want to raise the child for any reason, so I'm not sure why she would need some additional option for the case of birth control sabotage...

&gt;And what standard of proof would you apply to these claims? All methods of BC have a failure rate -- how could one prove that a woman hadn't, in fact, been on the pill and then stopped taking it when she found out she was pregnant? After, all prescriptions are a matter of doctor-patient confidentiality.

As a hypothetical, if the man had a signed agreement with the woman that she would be responsible for birth control, and later she confessed that she had (intentionally or negligently) failed to use the birth control.  There would need to be proof that she agreed to be solely responsible for birth control, as well as proof that she did not fulfill her responsibility.

&gt;It's highly dependent on the actions of another person, but that dependence is not absolute. Everyone, in my opinion, should have the absolute right to control their own gametes, but with that comes the absolute responsibility to oversee their own gametes, so to speak.

So in no circumstances should anyone be able to contract that responsibility to anyone else?  If you agree with your partner that she will use HBC, she did nothing wrong if she breaks the agreement and doesn't tell you?","1283300456"

As for the LA smog, it's improved over the years, but it's still bad.  The sooner we can shift over to electric or at least low-emission vehicles, the better.  Air pollution is [a major problem](http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/13/local/me-pollute13).

And why do Americans drive everywhere?  I don't know where you live, but I'd imagine you don't have a lot of sprawl if you walk many places.  Or, at least, a good public transportation system.  Suburbs in the US are rather spread out, so it's several miles to the nearest grocery store, bank, etc.  New York, on the other hand, is compact and has a great public transportation system, making a car superfluous in the city.

Static typing means that you cannot make certain types of errors, it's a fallacy to extrapolate that without it you will make these errors. Hence, while it does provide guarantees, lack of it does not preclude the developer from writing code that is free of such errors. In other words there is a possibility to make such errors in a dynamic language, but it says nothing about how common they are or how much of a problem they present.

So, really you wouldn't even need a study that compares statically typed languages to dynamic languages, what would be relevant to know is what proportion of bugs are type errors in projects developed in dynamic languages.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; So why can you not have insurance for pre-existing conditions without mandatory insurance?

Because *insurance* is like a bet.  You don't know the outcome when you buy it.

Insurance for pre-existing conditions is like insurance for a house that's already on fire.  No one will sell it to, because they're not stupid.  Or they will sell it to you, for precisely the cost of replacing the house, so you might as well not buy it.

&gt;  I would essentially be robbed all my life just to pay high premiums for older people who did NOT give their elders that luxury when they were still young and healthy.

Most suggested plans allow somewhat higher premiums for older people.  A factor of 2, maybe, not a factor of 5.  When you are older, you will enjoy the benefit of this arrangement.   

For the record, I am young enough to pay just $140 a month, out of pocket.   If I were in a group plan (no age or condition discrimination allowed), it would be about $320.    I would be willing to pay the $300 today in return for the stability it offered as I  got older.

But the point remains: you can't demand *both* coverage of pre-existing conditions *and* the option to buy insurance whenever you feel like it.  It just doesn't work.

Here's another suggestion that was suggested by  a Princeton economist: everyone to decide whether to opt in t a global system of mandatory insurance.  If you do opt in, then you get covered for pre-existing conditions for the rest of your life as long as you pay in.   Essentially, the Obama plan, or a society-wide group plan.    *But* if you opt out, you have to fight the unregulated insurance market, or  you can choose not to buy insurance.  If you get cancer, you're screwed.    You never get to opt in to the global plan once you get sick because you missed your chance.  Hospitals don't have to treat you. You're on your own.     I like it, because it allows a choice between a socialist system, and a free market one.","1283300505"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It kind of is, actually, at least in the West. Only the Roman Catholic Church recognizes the rite of exorcism and trains certain priests to perform it. And the RCC requires the priest to gather evidence of 3 things: superhuman strength, inexplicable knowledge of foreign languages, and extra-sensory perception. This evidence is gathered and presented to the local bishop, who actually has the authority to give the green light. Or it may get passed on to the Vatican for further examination. The subject must also be seen by a medical doctor and a psychiatrist, to eliminate ""natural"" causes. 

It's all horseshit, of course, but there is actually a system in place.

The Protestants do not actually perform exorcisms. They perform *deliverance*. The difference is that exorcism commands the demon to leave, while deliverance involves asking their god to intervene on behalf of the subject. Now, you'll have Protestant priests commanding ""demons"" to leave the subject anyway, but they're Doing It Wrong, because they are ignorant of their own standard practices. Like Ray Comfort.

And even with the woo-woo framework of classical demonic possession, no ever gets a dozen ""demons"" in them and is completely cleared in one session. That sort of ""infestation"" can take months, even years to completely work out. And even assuming that Comfort is recounting an event that he misunderstood, and not just completely fabricating, he would still be criminally irresponsible by not sending that woman to a doctor before he raised the curtains on Demon-Slayer Theater.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","My theory is that they are attempting to stray away from the 360's (ie. all console's/videogame's) childish appearance. The bright red, yellow, blue, and green colors for the buttons, while functional, look like something straight out of a child's playrooom. This new color scheme of gray, white, dark grey, and gray (respectively) make the controller appear like less of a toy and more of a tool.

I for one am excited about this change - not because I thought the controllers were childish, however. What people may or may not realize is that Microsoft was recently forcing third party developers to stick with the red, yellow, blue, and green color-scheme for their controllers, even if the controller design didn't call for it. An example would be [Madcatz's latest fight stick](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_h5Z3zckwPmk/TCb1sS_OdfI/AAAAAAAAAbs/SeBsICBzjxk/s1600/Mad+Catz+Super+Street+Fighter+IV+Arcade+FightStick+-+Tournament+Edition+S.jpg), a controller actually tarnished by the forced use of such colors. In comparison, the [PS3 version](http://www.getprice.com.au/images/uploadimg/1394/350_1996-1903-large.jpg) did not meet the same fate.

I'm hoping this change in Microsoft's personal policy also marks a change in their guidelines for third parties as well. However, it would not surprise me to see Microsoft use the exclusivity of such button colors as a selling point for their new design.","1283300567"

From the other point of view, however, it is very interesting that you do not even once mention either the comment or ratings system for the Android market which in theory should be very effective at mitigating the risk of buying a bad app.    I wonder why it is that these seem so poor at helping people judge the quality of apps?

What I think Google needs to do is improve the social aspect of the market.   What people *do* trust is what their friends recommend.  If I knew that even one of my friends had purchased the same app then that would be a significant reassurance and alleviate much of the mental assessment work I need to do to validate my decision.

"programming","t5_2fwo","*Leading* tab stops work the same as in a monospaced font.

This kind of code doesn't work in a proportional font:

    #test {
        display:          block;
        background-color: #123456;
    }

Nor does this:

    var obj = {
        a:                         'one thing',
        something:                 'another thing',
        specialTemporaryTestValue: 'yet another'
    };

But I don't like that style of coding anyway. What am I supposed to do if I remove that `specialTemporaryTestValue` property? Reformat the rest of the spacing to match the new narrower columns?

I prefer avoiding the column-oriented code entirely:

&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;\#test {  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;display:&amp;#160;block;  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;background-color:&amp;#160;#123456;  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;}

&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;var&amp;#160;obj&amp;#160;=&amp;#160;{  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;a:&amp;#160;'one thing',  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;something:&amp;#160;'another thing',  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;specialTemporaryTestValue:&amp;#160;'yet another'  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;};

Besides being easier to maintain, I find that style easier to read: I don't have to scan left to right across a sea of whitespace to find the value for each property.

Here's another example:

    function doSomething( oneArg,            // cool arg
                          anotherArg,        // even cooler
                          andAnotherArg ) {  // three's the charm
    }

What do I do when I rename the function as `doSomethingNew()`? Move everything over three columns?

Instead, I format it like this:

&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;function&amp;#160;doSomething(  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;oneArg,&amp;#160;//&amp;#160;cool&amp;#160;arg  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;anotherArg,&amp;#160;//&amp;#160;even&amp;#160;cooler  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;andAnotherArg&amp;#160;&amp;#160;//&amp;#160;three's&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;charm  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;)&amp;#160;{  
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;}

This looks fine in a monospaced font too, once you accept the lack of column alignment on the comments:

    function doSomething(
        oneArg, // cool arg
        anotherArg, // even cooler
        andAnotherArg  // three's the charm
    ) {
    }

**tl;dr** Instead of using a coding style that requires a monospaced font, I've adopted a coding style that works with both monospaced and proportional fonts.","1283300579"

Look up sauce recipes that you like and go to town.  Simmer sauces instead of boiling them and the beef will be more tender than the boiled rubbery stuff HH creates.

Cheese sauces need some flour or they get lumpy.  Use low heat and slowly add shredded cheese that has been dusted with flour, it should take a minute or two to fully melt,  stir often.

Add water or milk slowly if it is too thick, no soup for you!

Saute an onion in a bit of oil at first.  You never can go wrong with this.  Add other veggies and you are in healthy territory now.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","No worries!  I've made a few other posts in this thread you might want to read as well.  In answer to your question, yes; theoretically.  In practice however, the problem is that your meter can be thrown off by one of many things.  For example, if you're spot metering and you happen to meter the darkest (or lightest) part of the background, you'll be thrown off.  Similarly, if you're on Matrix mode (assuming you're shooting Nikon; Canon will be different), who *knows* what Nikon thinks your exposure is supposed to be?

The point is this: meters only get us so far.  They give us an idea of exposure, but you'll *always* have to make adjustments to match the specific environment you're in.  As you shoot more and more events, you'll begin to get a clearer idea of what sort of adjustments you'll need to make during the shoot.  But even then, it'll constantly be changing throughout your shoot.

When bouncing light off a wall or ceiling, you're going to lose light; sometimes as much as 70-80% of your flash's output.  I'm usually overexposing my flash's output whenever I bounce or shoot through something (such as an umbrella), but this varies.  For example, when shooting in extremely low light (such as a live performance with low stage lighting), I'll often underexpose my flash by 2-3 stops, so it doesn't overpower the ambient light.

I'm sorry I don't have a cut-and-dry answer for you; it really depends on your circumstances and environmental specifics.","1283300610"

Turn on the grill... put butter 1 side of the bread slice on each slice. Put the slice on the grill... put the cheese on it, then the meat, then the caramelized onions. When the bread is golden and crunchy, flip it. Wait for it to be the same than the other side. Put in a plate. Rinse and repeat for as many sandwich that you want.

However, if the officer started with a little force to keep a woman away from paramedics, like grabbing her arm, and she takes a swing at the officer, I'd hope the officer would punch back, knock her to the ground, and/or mace her: whatever the officer judges appropriate to deescalate the situation. If, after that, the woman continues to be combative, I would hope the officer would continue to use appropriate force to try and subdue her. While we don't know the exact circumstances of this case, it is entirely within the realm of possibilities that a woman could be so combative that the proper force would be enough to cause a miscarriage. An officer should be more careful with the use of force towards pregnant women, but an officer's first concern should be his or her own safety, the safety of the paramedics, and the safety of those who aren't fighting with the cops.","1283300621"

"math","t5_2qh0n","So your original path is specified in x/y coordinates. Let's say your path can be expressed as a function: y' = f(x')... in this case f(x') = (x' - x_0)^2.

The sphere is:
r = R*cos(v)

z = R*sin(v)

x = r*cos(u)

y = r*sin(u)

u = 0 ... 2*pi
v = -pi/2 ... pi/2

Let's say that x' is north/south on the sphere. So x' = (v*R)/(2*pi). y' is east/west. y' = r*u/(2*pi). Since y' is a function of x', we get: y' = f(x') = r*u/(2*pi), u = f(x')*2*pi/r

This means you only have one independent parameter, v. This will produce a line in 3 dimensions.

So the additional equations we made are:

y' = f(x')

u = f(x')*2*pi/r

 x' = (v*R)/(2*pi).","1283300635"

Or that even if flagella could form self-organized thoughts, which is laughably retarded, it would represent a degree of consciousness that would be so minute, so trivially inconsequential, that it would be akin to comparing a single particle to a black-hole, since they both have gravity you know.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","**TLDR: THIS PICTURE IS FLAT OUT WRONG &amp; MISLEADING**, bank customers **DO NOT PAY** for parking, only non-customers have to actually pay that sign's rate.

**EVERYONE CALM DOWN**.  this branch is a few blocks down from my house in Hancock Park where I've lived for 25+ years, and they do NOT charge their customers to park (their address is 100 N Larchmont Blvd, 90004, here's the [Street View](http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=100+N+Larchmont+Blvd,+90004&amp;sll=49.891235,-97.15369&amp;sspn=26.468683,86.572266&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=100+N+Larchmont+Blvd,+Los+Angeles,+California+90004,+United+States&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=34.073546,-118.323665&amp;panoid=b-r-lXnSx84uINq2RdSd7Q&amp;cbp=11,119.39,,0,5&amp;ll=34.073546,-118.323655&amp;spn=0.003573,0.017939&amp;z=16), tap zoom ""+"" twice to see that pic).

anyways, I've been going to this branch for 6+ years, and never paid a penny for parking.  despite what that sign says the rate actually only applies to NON-customers who use up a parking space but don't bank at that branch (the small lot can only hold about 17 cars maximum so yeah, the spaces are pretty valuable given how super-busy Larchmont is, especially during the day).  that guy you see in the picture, Gilberto, gives you a ticket which you then get validated inside the branch for **FREE**, and when you're done with your banking biz you hand the validated tix back to him.  he's super nice, helps you navigate the crowded lot, and has been working there since 2004.  I totally understand the corporate rage, but I just wanted to correct the inaccurate title that customers are being charged to park at this particular branch.  **SIMPLY NOT TRUE!!** ","1283300693"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;For each person there was an office, but for nobody was there one that he was permitted to choose for himself, to define, and to fill according to his own wishes. It was wrong to desire new gods, it was totally wrong to try and give the world anything! There was no duty for enlightened people, none, none, except this: to seek themselves, to become certain of themselves, to grope forward along their own path, wherever it might lead. --I was deeply affected by that. I had often played with images of the future, I had dreamt of roles that might be meant for me, as a poet, perhaps, or as a prophet, or as a painter, or whatever else. That was all meaningless. I didn't exist to write poetry, to preach sermons, to paint pictures; neither I nor anyone else existed for that purpose. All of that merely happened to a person along the way. Everyone had only one true vocation: to find himself. Let him wind up as a poet or a madman, as a prophet or a criminal -- that wasn't his business; in the long run, it was irrelevant. His business was to discover his own destiny, not just any destiny, and to live it totally and undividedly. Anything else was just a half-measure, an attempt to run away, an escape back to the ideal of the masses, an adaptation, fear of one's own nature.


&gt;The person who truly wants nothing except his own destiny no longer has others of his own kind; he stands completely alone and has only the chill of outer space around him. The person who desires nothing else but destiny no longer has either models or ideals, nothing dear to him, nothing to console him! And that is the right path to follow. People like you and me are really lonely, it's true, but we still have one another, we have the secret satisfaction of being different, of rebelling, of desiring the unusual. That too, must fall by the wayside if a person wants to follow the path to its end. He musn't even desire to be a revolutionary, a role model, or a martyr.""

Basically, some root servers have DNSSEC stuff now included in the response which will get dropped by your upstream firewall because the combined size will be over 512 bytes, which will cause Bind 9 to fall back to TCP, after however many seconds it takes.

You can try setting edns-udp-size to 512 bytes, this should tell upstream nameservers to truncate their responses.

Another option is to tell your hosting provider that their network is broken. Dropping UDP DNS over 512 bytes is broken behaviour, and I'd treat it as a fault.

Are you getting any messages in the logs? By default, named on debian will log useful things. Some snippets of any errors you see might be helpful, if any.

Turn on the grill... put butter 1 side of the bread slice on each slice. Put the slice on the grill... put the cheese on it, then the meat, then the caramelized onions.

It's not as ""stealthy"" as the stealth bomber and F-117, but they used radar absorbant materials, including paint. Which was water soluble and washed off when it rained.

And you know what - she was.  I didn't read the books until much later - but I was sent to it from some friends that did and told me that I was already doing a lot of what was in there.  I was already pretty successful.

The methods are essentially human marketing methods...  But people's responses are always going to be a factor of who they are.  If you keep picking out the same type of people that your methods work on- you are going to have the same results.  

And believe it or not - my wife and I met on Match.com.  A place that is not a controlled environment where I could pick her out.  The methods helped allure her into dating - but she still wouldn't sleep with me.  AND.... That was her method of taking me down and holding a moral ground at the same time.  She took me down hook line and sinker.

I heard the best saying from a college friend ""Don't fuck it up with fucking.""  

People are going to behave how THEY are going to behave.  You aren't manipulating them into doing something that they wouldn't already do - you are just pulling out their natural character from them.  You are just able to read and do it quicker.  

So instead of using it on all the same people - go find a group you can't and you will find a gem in there.  And what I found was the drop dead gorgeous girl that I couldn't get into bed - was the keeper.  I wasted a lot of time with those quick hits.","1283300757"

What constitutes an outlier depends on the circumstances - it's a problem-specific question (in particular, an outlier is only an outlier with respect to some model), not a statistical question that exists outside of all problem-specific considerations. 

That is, I can't tell you, in ignorance of a detailed understanding of your problem, whether a point is an outlier. A visually surprising observation may be perfectly consistent with your model for the process, and so not an outlier from your model. On  the other hand (and I have seen this occur in practice), an observation that doesn't initially look visually surprising might in some circumstances nevertheless be an outlier from the model. (Though a more appropriate data display - one that takes account of the same knowledge present in the model - will generally reveal the outlier)

You say your data are lognormal. (how do you know this?)

Do you have the data all from a common distribution, or do the parameters of your distribution vary across observations in some way?

"NewOrleans","t5_2qhp5","Hey, you're my neighbor! Welcome to the best neighborhood in the city (in my opinion, anyway). As far as stuff to do in our neighborhood goes, we've got some great restaurants (Lola's, Venizia, Liuzza's, and Cafe Degas - for something a little fancier), bars (Pal's is great, as WhiteWorm mentioned, and there are a few other close ones like Parkview Tavern on Carrollton - not to be mistaken with Parkway Bakery - for cheap beer and Bayou Beer Garden on Jeff Davis for variety), and dessert (Angelo Brocato's!) among other things of other varieties. Fortier Park on Esplanade is also a nice little place to hang out, play chess, read, etc. 

As for your photography needs, a good friend of mine spent a lot of time trying to find a darkroom she could use in the city while she was living here and I don't think she had much luck. I do have some friends who work at Lakeside Camera, though, and I know they're good, but I don't know how their services work and I do know they're kind of pricey. There's *got* to be something, though. Good luck with your quest!","1283300784"

It does correlate with the love of the bodies flying from the high explosives, or the love of being able to shoot people in the face only to hear them groan in pain and slump to the floor. I really can't see what isn't hilarious about it all ^_^

Not to mention, the love of seeing ""Headshot"" with a high explosive round. Or nailing people from unlikely places, or getting the drop on them, or nailing the camper around the corner. It is a nice weapon ^_^

Worth mentioning: it has it's draw backs. For the strategically disinclined, the easiest way to nail someone is to get in close combat with them. Much like a spear in real life, this weapon kicks ass at long range, but if you can get within range, you just need to dodge a single slow-ish projectile. Use cover and stealth to your advantage! 
there are also specific angles that are extremely hard to hit people at when they are using a launcher. Use it yourself and you can learn ^_^

Personally, I don't see any problem with Target reassigning cashiers who don't want to handle bacon. It's not like they're actively trying to stop you from buying pork. I once worked in a clothing store for a couple years, and because I'm horribly allergic to wool, I had to get help folding the sweaters. I think that's kinda the same thing.

As for the cabs at the airport... I practically lived at MSP for two years when I was in a long-distance relationship. I never ran into a cab driver who seemed to want to know if I were packing booze. But if cab drivers want to deny a ride to a disabled person with a service dog, well, I have no doubt that person will take their business elsewhere, and then tell their friends not to do business with the cab company.

Also, I would argue that Minnesota really isn't that liberal. Maybe in the Twin Cities area, but outside that, we have a lot of very strongly republican districts. Michelle Bachmann anyone?

Let me put it this way....you didn't say anything which addressed the point. This led me to conclude that you didn't get it.

&gt;Convicts have usually done bad stuff which is evidence that they may not be a good person

No, convicts have done **ILEGAL** stuff, which is not the same thing.

You yourself are a pot smoker, or used to be, and could easily find yourself a convict.

&gt; is evidence that they may not be a good perso

Sure, it's evidence they *may* be not be a good person...nobody is disputing that. The problem is it's not terribly strong evidence.

The point is you seemed to be making a big deal about it in your original post....the fact that he specifically was a convict.

This is silly as that's not the real issue at all....the issue he is a bad person.

A convict is simply someone who allegedly broke the law, and was found guilty. It in itself says almost nothing about the type of person they are.

If you know *what* they are convicted of, that says a bit more...but even still. There are plenty of former purse snatchers who are now a better person than you.

&gt;Stores are owned by people. He was stealing from people.

You're making a pointless semantical distinction. I was very specific about the point I was making....I was contrasting petty shoplifting with actual theft of *personal* property. They of course affect ""people"" in the end, but that's not relevant to the point at hand.

&gt;No, but that's irrelevant to the discussion. In both cases we're discussing a known convict. 

See, I was right about you missing the point.

It is VERY relevent to the discussion...because in that case they would be the *SAME* person....but *NOT* a convict.

You've admitted my point: that the problem is not really that they are a convict....it's that they are a bad person.

Being a convict can be indicative of being a bad person, but it is nowhere close to anything approaching conclusive.

This is a pretty simple concept, and I don't know why you can't just admit you were perhaps wrong in your phrasing and clarify....of course from your posts you seem quite the arrogant little 20 year old who hasn't moved out yet....so that may be why.


&gt; It would be unreasonable of me to expect them to treat me the exact 

Nobody is asking that though. The point is we are talking about someone who is a ""convict""....there is no mention of when or what they were convicted of.

You did not make a big deal about how he was a *RAPIST* or *MURDERER*, or that he committed X crime *YESTERDAY*.....you made a big deal out of the mere fact that he had been convicted of a crime.

&gt;Granted, but it is evidence

It's evidence....but not very good evidence. You'll forgive me if I don't trust the opinions of a 20 year old who hasn't moved out of their parents house yet when talking about the moral ambiguity and mistakes of the real world.

&gt;That's not a reason to grant full trust immediately upon release.

Again, evidence that you miss the point. Nobody is saying you should.

All I said was the mere fact of being a convict is not reason for revoking trust.

&gt;My story was meant to illustrate that, despite people claiming that someone else is nice or reformed and should be trusted, doesn't mean they actually are

Here you're just repeating what I already said....

...and it has nothing to do with what we're talking about. It's a straw man.

Nobody said you have to take someone's word....in fact that's the whole point. You should judge people based on all the information you have about them....not one simple fact like at some point they were convicted of a crime.

&gt;It has everything to do with what we're talking about.
No it doesn't, as I've explained clearly.

&gt;You're upset that people are emphasizing that he's a convict,
Yes, when they should be emphasizing that he is a bad person. I'm not saying it's entirely irrelevant....but it should not be a focus.

There is a lot of discrimination against convicts, and you don't realize how easy it is to become one, because you haven't been out into the real world (through no fault of your own).

You don't realize that you perpetuating the stereotype of ""all convicts are bad people"", actually hurts real people out there.....a lot of them didn't even do anything wrong at all....all they did was smoke some pot or something.

My friend wasn't the best example granted, but I brought him up specifically because it's why this hit close to home for me.


&gt; and brought up an andicdotal story about your friend who is a convict but a good guy,

Yes...I realize it seems like a double standard, but mine is actually relevant.

In order for my point to be made, I only need to show that one convict is not a bad person. 

In order for yours to be made, you need to show that all are bad, or the vast majority is bad.


&gt; and then extrapolating that people should let the convict thing slide.

No, not what I said at all.

So yes, the point did whizz right over your head.

&gt; I'm bringing up a story about a convict who people said was a good guy who really wasn't, showing that caution is warranted.

....but that's not what we're talking about.

Nobody is saying caution isn't warranted.

You specifically made a big deal about the SINGLE FACT that he was a convict.

You said something like ""I can't let a CONVICT live in my house"".

Imagine if you had said BLACK PERSON, instead of CONVICT, and you can see how your reasoning is flawed.

Statistically speaking...most convicts are black. So that means you shouldn't trust them right?

If it was true that all convicts are guilty, or that the guilty ones had all committed really bad crimes....you would have a leg to stand on.

As it is now, you should just clarify your original point that you don't like the guy because he's a skeezball....and if you think it's relevant add that he got caught being a skeezball.","1283300830"

It's also the reason why it's illegal to marry government and big business. This is why, when corporations spend their time lobbying for what amounts to anti-competitive legislation, they instead lobby for something more opaque: ""regulation"". For it's regulations and bureaucracy that keep, for example, farmers from competing with Monsanto.

It's ignorant to blame a body politic (the people) because people are people are people whether they're German or American or Russian. If you put groups of people through the same system, they all make the same aggregate mistakes and succumb to the same deceptions. Instead, realize it's the system that molds the people into the voting trends that you see in a nation.

My point is that people still don't ""run"" the government just because they can vote for a few talking heads and hope they stand by a few talking points they made during a campaign.

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what yellow stuff you're referring to, but if you are talking about the molten metal coming out of the side of the building, that's aluminium.  It has a melting point ranging from 887 F to 1184 F, and the jet fuel burned at about 1800 F.  The debris of the plane, mostly aluminium, were in the fire.  The aluminium melted, as one would expect.  You'll notice that it's only as the trusses are beginning to visibly break that you see the the molten metal come out, spilling down from the 81st floor and out from the 80th.

But while I would not want to see those issues in Earthlings, why not have documentaries about those things? We can have more than one documentary!

Back to Earthlings, I do wish they had shown more of the issues with even so-called ""humane"" and ""ethical"" farming. While what they did show is amazingly commonplace, there are still people that see some great distinction between the exploitation they see in graphic video like that and the exploitation they contribute to -- whether or not they are choosing those ""humane"" alternatives some or all of the time or not at all.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;So, if your argument isn't that states or entities that occasionally punish the innocent are seen as arbitrary and thus erode trust in institutions, what is your argument for why punishing the innocent is worse than failing to punish the guilty? 
First, I agree that institutions erode with tyranny. 
As for why the relationship between the innocent and the guilty. 
The guilty are only guilty when it has been determined according to the agreed upon conditions(law), that they are in fact guilty(determined by).  A functioning justice system makes that determination and then executes a punishment, or exonerates.  A system of injustice executes then makes the determination, or doesn't see the need to.  The individual has no chance to make a rational defense to an objective forum for the resolution of a conflict.  The law has no relevance. 
A system of injustice to the individual is unable to arbitrate resolutions in equity.  

&gt;You use words like ""corrupt"" and ""justice,"" but to me, these words are just imaginary constructs that differ from person to person and influence their behavior. 
Subjective views in different contexts have no application to the overall concept of justice. Which is equity.  What is right and wrong may different from person to person, but in the context of a system of justice, the system must be equitable to function.  The only way a system can be equitable is by having it be objective to the individual (I think this is refered to as the law being blind).

&gt;To me, they do not describe the conditions of a system or the world because they efface the fact that every system makes errors. I'd like to move away from words like ""justice"" and ""corruption"" towards an empirical valuation of suffering given various circumstances 
Systems make errors because they are run by people, who are flawed.  This is why appeals processes are adopted.  To rectify errors.  But the valuation you are seeking already exists in the system, it serves as an appropriate way to execute an appropriate level of punishment.  After proving guilt.  

Justice is different from person to person, that is why a standard is created and followed.  This standard is the product of a collaboration on what is and what isn't law.  (assuming democratic society)
The purpose of the system is rational conflict resolution of which its orgins are the answer to the revenge killing and mob element historically. 

&gt;(e.g. comparing 100000000 guilty men unpunished for every innocent man wrongfully punished vs. 1 guilty man unpunished for every 100000000 innocent men wrongfully punished. The numbers make a difference to me and whether or not we condone vigilantism alters those ratios. Do they matter to you? 
The ratios mean nothing to me.  Only the equity of the system matters.  

&gt;You say that the punished innocent man and the unpunished guilty man do not have equal weight, but then what is the ratio? Is the punishment of an innocent man infinitely worse than failing to punish a guilty man?).

Yes. (To be edited later in classes)

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Agreed, I have been a member of many of the major banks (boa, chase, citi, wamu, wachovia, fidelity, wells), and I would rank boa near the bottom. One time I found out they were overcharging me 5 dollars a month, and when i went to the bank they said I would have to pay 10 dollars to grab previous records to prove it. It was that kind of stealing/poor service that led me to leave. 

Citibank is probably the worst I ever dealt with. They also stole my money, but when they sent a check to pay me back they purposefully sent me less because they knew i wouldn't complain about 5 dollars. As far as I'm concerned, they stole my money twice. 

Wamu (and now chase) has been great. 

Also, I'd like to point out that many people probably get money taken from them by banks without realizing it. I watch my records very carefully so I catch these things. I assume mistakes are usually just mistakes, so I can live with them; it's the way the bank deals with being confronted about the mistake that indicates their intentions to me. ","1283300925"

If he cheated on AND abused his wife, than yes, he would be a lot worse. 

But just cheating?    
 
Personally I think you are the one with immature views and judgmental personality.  Einstein was also very promiscuous.  Karl Marx was not only promiscuous but he was an asshole to his wife.  So you should constantly remind people about that in all threads relating to Marx and Einstein.  Because it is so relevant.  

I seriously don't think you even know what you're saying when you point out he has mistresses.  What's the point of bringing that up?  Pointing out that he's not superhuman so we shouldn't idolize him that much? You must be joking.  I think people don't look up to MLK enough.

IMO the fact that he had mistresses shouldn't change a thing.  You judge him like he's donald trump and he's not being faithful to his wife.  No, in fact conditions were much different. 

BTW Stop being judgemental.  I was just joking when I called you a virgin.  I am not in high school.

'Voters are Stupid' is one of the most self-damaging memes that liberals propagate -- not necessarily because they aren't, but because it allows people to not question any more closely why their party isn't doing well.   

For instance:  'Voters are stupid' closes off any examination of the actual policies of the administration and Congress.   Yet, polls show that health care reform was very unpopular at time, and is *still* very unpopular.   Even if you think health care reform is a good thing despite the desire of the public, you would at least think that liberals would have some discussion on how to make it more popular -- **assuming** they acknowledged it as a problem.  But they don't, so liberals keep blaming all of their unpopularity on 'stupid people'.   


The whole 'stupid people' meme is a serious strategic political liability - if you hold voters in contempt, in the long term they'll hold you in contempt as well.

Then you have the distorted signal to play around with without losing any lowend.","1283300979"

Good work with the PPO.

Your dad sounds like he's trying to come around. Tell him you love him, but you've spent the last X number of years evaluating who you are, and what you believe, and while you'd like to talk to him, he has to understand that you haven't come to these decisions lightly, or on a whim, and he has to respect that. If he still has trouble, you can tell him that JESUS himself BLESSED a gay relationship, so he ought to be able to at least ACCEPT one. (See e.g. http://www.gaychristian101.com/Gay-Centurion.html .) If things go south, you can always send him the [various arguments for JESUS himself being gay](http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jegay.htm), but I'd hold off on that for the time being.

* **Lunch:** A salad with plenty of greens, turkey/chicken breast, avocado, tomato (somewhat high in carbs, but they fit within my macros) and a full fat mayonnaise.
* **Snack:** A can of tuna with some more mayonnaise.
* **PWO:** Protein shake (currently have some Zero Carb Protein by Inner Armour, as it was on special). Mix with water and it's still tasty. If you can't handle that then slowly add full cream milk/cream until it's at the minimum you can handle. Also if you want you can add some dextrose, as carbs post workout aren't the devil they are at all other times.
* **Dinner:** Steak/chicken, seasoned appropriately with a large side of broccoli and cauliflower.
* **Dessert:** Another protein shake, maybe some cheese.

"shittyadvice","t5_2rch1","Ok as an IT PROFESSIONAL I get this question a lot. It's a complicated procedure, but you can do it if you're dedicated enough. First off you'll need to backtrace the Protocol Transmission. To do this you'll need a length of copper wire (at least 25mm Odia), a pair of insulated forceps and a wooden keg filled below halfway with coconut milk. Hook copper wire up to the nearest power line or substation (doesn't matter which).

Place the other end in the keg of coconut milk, making sure the exposed end of the wire is fully submerged in the milk. Stir regularly. Next you need to stealthily acquire your School's main Data Protocol Transmission Processing Relay System Junction and submerge it in the coconut milk which should now be charged with the required volume of isotonic enzyme gluons. Leave for 26 minutes.

If your school gets suspicions of the missing junction then just replace it with a shoebox that you have drawn buttons on, this should stall them long enough. After 26 minutes the backtrace should be complete. Return the main data protocol transmission processing relay system junction to the control center. Now you need to inoculate your local IO distortion spectrum. To do this you need to *google how to set up a VPN or proxy* connection dialogue to bypass the schools anti-strobe blockage mechanism.

Throughout 2004 and 2005, Monsanto filed lawsuits against many farmers in Canada and the U.S. on the grounds of patent infringement, specifically the farmers' sale of seed containing Monsanto's patented genes. In some cases, farmers claimed the seed was unknowingly sown by wind carrying the seeds from neighboring crops, a claim rejected in Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser.[10] These instances began in the mid to late 1990s, with one of the most significant cases being decided in Monsanto's favor by the Canadian Supreme Court. By a 5-4 vote in late May 2004, that court ruled that ""by cultivating a plant containing the patented gene and composed of the patented cells without license, the appellants (canola farmer Percy Schmeiser) deprived the respondents of the full enjoyment of the patent."" With this ruling, the Canadian courts followed the U.S. Supreme Court in its decision on patent issues involving plants and genes.","1283301014"

Ice ice baby (x2)
All right stop collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gain weight
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

CHORUS
Ice ice baby vanillla (x4)

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
Did you stop no I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a guage and Vanilla with a nine
Reading for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumpet to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

REPEAT CHORUS

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast other DJs say damn
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while Shay revolves it

Ice ice baby vanilla
Ice ice baby (oh-oh) vanilla
Ice ice baby vanilla
Ice ice baby vanilla ice
Yo man let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice ice baby too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold (x2)
Ice ice baby

That's why we love Lisp macros. They allow us to hide a lot of boilerplate parenthesis behind a cleaner syntax. That being said, it's considered bad style to write a macro that makes the code look even uglier or more difficult to comprehend at the end of the day. The whole point behind it is to make it more expressive and easier to understand -- turn it into code that is simple enough to be used without careful study. The basic point is that you need to write your macro so that its usage is expressive enough that you don't need to look up its definition.","1283301054"

I didn't really mean it, but I thought it was total bull that dad could stay home and I couldn't.  They put me in counseling instead and the counselor accused my mother of being an alcoholic and my father of raping me (both notions are completely ludicrous, had nothing to do with why I was upset, and actually caused more problems for me because my parents then thought I lied to the counselor).  The second time was after my car wreck, I was having severe panic attacks.. and that guy refused to see me again after my first 3 visits because he wanted to be paid up front by my insurance, which they wouldn't do, so he told me I was fine and had nothing wrong with me.

I can agree with the ""too awesome to use"" scenario, but the right pricing model should alleviate that.  What's important is that the user starts seeing some benefit for little investment, and that their gradual use convinces them that the price is right.  

The payment schedules shouldn't be too long (my example of 50 uses is probably too long), and at each point along the way the user could have the option to complete the purchase, possibly with an incentive (ie, lower price) to do so.  So: after four uses the user sees ""You have paid $0.40 so far, or 40% of the total.  Buy it for an additional $0.40, or pay $0.10 to keep using it (will have completed 50% of the total).""

Instead, I trolled the Upcoming section (perhaps that was an unfortunate metaphor, but it's the best I can come up with.)  Even then, I was amazed at how repetitive the stories were.  Also, there wasn't any good way to categorize the stories, they were all lumped together in a big stream. 

I've been on Reddit for almost a week now, and I'm really starting to like it.  I have seen a few recent interviews with Kevin Rose, and he seemed to really, honestly be trying to do what the majority of the userbase for Digg wanted.  Possibly he is right. It could be that the majority of the userbase wants another facebook or twitter.  I don't.  Reddit seems to be more what I've been wanting from Digg for a while.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I'm biased, but I recommend Muay Thai to anybody, partially because its simplicity.  There are only about seven strikes total (straight punch, hook, uppercut, elbow, kick, knee, foot jab), and one can achieve mastery of all of the specific techniques more rapidly than in most other martial arts.  Stringing them together in a manner that makes sense is the hard part.  There are an insane number of clinch techniques, however, and becoming proficient takes about as long as becoming decent at BJJ.

I'd recommend looking for a gym that trains fighters for amateur fights, smokers, etc, and preferably one where the head trainer has been in a number of professional fights himself.  That's the only way to ensure that you have an instructor who understands what works in real time.  My impression is that promotion within the Thai Boxing Association is starting to become more political while having less of a basis in merit than it used to.  My first Muay Thai instructor was certified, but his instruction was uninspired and he didn't care about the development of his students.  He had not been in any fights, and wasn't training anybody for fights.  I hadn't learned anything new for my final six months at that school, and had to unlearn a lot of bad habits upon transferring to a new school.  My new instructor has been in professional fights, trains students for both amateur and professional fights, and has trained professional MMA fighters in stand-up.  Qualifications such as these are far more important than titles.

Also, any good Muay Thai school should incorporate ""timing sparring"", which is basically a slow motion and light form of sparring that allows students to focus upon timing their techniques in an unpredictable environment for an extended period of time without worrying about getting hurt.  It tends to prevent people's technique from turning to slop when they finally spar heavy or fight.","1283301147"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","It's true, I could have expanded on my response.  However, I thought what I said was clear enough.  Taxes make no impact on that argument, therefore using that argument to say taxes are in some way bad is silly.

Here's what I mean:

It is possible to ""break your back"" to get to a higher income level and then realize that you would have been better off not going to all that trouble.  With or without taxes.

eg: You go from 8 hour days to 16 hour days.  You get a reward at the end of the year of a $50 gift certificate to starbucks and you don't drink coffee.  You immediately realize your boss is an asshole.  Taxes do NOT enter into this equation.  Change jobs!  :-)

Now, to the specific mention of taxes.  It changes only the way in which you can and should calculate what life is worth to you.

If you go from 8 hour days to 16 hour days and your company gives you a bonus of $50k, is that worth it to you?

If you go from 8 hour days to 16 hour days and your company gives you a bonus of $30k, is it worth it to you?

Now, if you are immediately below the progressive tax rate of 40% on the new income and your company gives you a bonus of $50k (pre-tax), then you could simply change the equation: ""Is it worth it to go from 8 hour days to 16 hour days for an increase of $30k""

You see why the argument is silly?  Examples 2 and 3 are IDENTICAL.  Tax makes no difference to decision you have to make - it only changes the calculations that you should do for your job, your company, your income and your tax rate to enable you to properly make that decision.


* The one aspect of your comment that is undeniably true is the following:

&gt; with people who lack perfect knowledge about the tax system

Yep.  Same as when people look at pre-tax pay and start buying things based on those calculations.  Taxes are not to blame for their stupidity and debt.  Lack of understanding of taxes IS to blame.  And believing that progressive taxation can mean you earn ""less"" when you now earn enough to move to a higher tax bracket is EXACTLY the kind of ignorance that causes these problems.

I agree 95%* with the submitter.  To really win the war on drugs at a federal level, tthe issue has gotta go to the supreme court -- the only branch of government entirely devoted to solving controversial problems, because justices serve for life and don't have to be afraid to speak their true mind, at least not as much as the political branches of US govt.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","It makes some sense, but the thing with abortion is that once a woman is pregnant, it's no longer her body. The way murder laws go now, are that if a pregnant woman is killed, her baby is counted, and thus it's a double homicide. I know I'm playing conservative on that, but people do need to face consequences for their actions. If a 16 year old girl is faced with having a nine month pregnancy and having to tell her parents about it, rather than getting an abortion, then she may reconsider having unsafe sex again. 

I know jails aren't loving, but they are a little cushier than they should be. It's like when you ground a kid. When they are stuck at home, that's not the only punishment. You take away their phone, their tv, and their games. It's the same idea, except on a bigger scale. I've also heard that vitaloaf is tasteless, and as such drives misbehaving convicts to behave better. The point is to keep people from reoffending.

You're right about the minimum wage. I accidentally contradicted myself there. Thank you for pointing that out. Thieves should however work equally in value of what they stole. Somehow.

Oh indeed, someone has to make the test and someone has to judge the skills. The way we do it in the UK is we have a panel of judges of varying seniority, lawyers, ordinary magistrates (volunteers in the UK), and laypeople, all appointed through open competition, who examine the candidates for their aptitude and then will present a politician with a name which s/he can reject or ask to be reconsidered, but if s/he does so, must give a public reason why.

They make their decision based on references (nominated by either the candidate or the commission), written papers based on analysing case studies, interviews, and the response during a simulated court environment.

It's not perfect but to me electing someone invites them to be partisan, giving them a constituency and donors who they must respond to.","1283301187"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","First, I want to commend your post for its style, sources, and general accuracy. This is the sort of thing that makes me love Reddit-- even when I'm downvoted and met with argumentation, it's a pleasurable, intellectual process.

The problem, however, is that you seem to be vastly underestimating the amount of energy and infrastructure that would be required for us to completely leave oil behind.

&gt; Show numbers.

This is a fair request, and one easily done.

Citing the chart you listed above, 15% of the US's oil consumption is non-fuel related. Currently, the US consumes approximately 20 million barrels of oil per day, which means 3 million barrels per day are consumed for *non-fuel* usage.

Now, let's look at how that works out in terms of what a single synthetic fuel plant can produce.

The largest single synthetic fuel project on which I'm able to find information is the [Ohio River Clean Fuels project by Baard Energy, which is expected to produce 53,000 barrels per day at peak efficiency, which it will not reach until 2015](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_fuel#Proposed_projects). If we are to use this as a standard (which, to be honest, is giving your argument more leeway than is merited, as all other such plants operating are well below that capacity), we must take it that *FIFTY SEVEN* more of these projects must be built *and* operate at peak efficiency to *only* meet the requirements of the US's demand for non-fuel related oil, [at a cost of approximately $5 billion each](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Ohio_River_Clean_Fuels)-- or $283 billion for the whole shabang, roughly **six times the pre-tax income of the world's largest oil producer, Exxon Mobile, in 2009**.

This is, of course, to say absolutely nothing concerning the fact that (1) the creation of synthetic fuels **still requires fossil fuels** in some form or another, so while it may lower our direct dependence on naturally occurring crude, it simply makes us more dependent on other fossil fuels, which require energy and production capacity of their own, as well as fuel-related oil consumption for transportation, and (2) all of the numbers and sources concerning our possible utilization of nuclear energy remains *in theory* and *unbuilt.* This must be factored into cost and timescale So, in terms of cost, practicality, and usage, one can't just say, ""Welp, we'll just build hundreds of then nuclear/thorium power plants and then we'll solve oil!"" One has to factor in the time, money, and cost-efficient nature of these projects, as well as the needs of *other* resources and infrastructure in order to make this work.

At the end of the day, I believe our disagreement stems largely by my mistaken omission of a single word from my original post-- ""currently."" What I meant to say, or at least imply, was that the energy, investment, and time required to pull a complete switcharoo concerning our energy consumption in our lifetime is completely unrealistic and nonsensical. This doesn't mean that I advocate sticking with the status quo by any means-- I'm as excited by breakthroughs in new, cleaner energy production and consumption as you are! But one cannot get so lost in the fog of excited optimism that one cannot maintain a realistic and level-headed understanding of what one can expect to accomplish in the foreseeable future. I *want* to see us moving in this direction, but I stand by my original claim, save for the addition of the above mentioned word-- *currently*. My omission of the word was my mistake, not yours, so I apologize for it. 

All that said:

&gt; Finally, I'd like to point out that it wouldn't kill us to rebuild our cities around electric trains (preferably an advanced version like PRT)

I couldn't agree with you more. In fact, it's funny that you mention the PRT system, as it's a system with which I'm well acquainted. [I'm an alumnus of WVU and currently reside in Morgantown, WV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgantown_Personal_Rapid_Transit). The system has plenty of problems, but it's one which I think *could* be used to great effect in a number of areas and geographic locations.","1283301225"

Have you not actually read my last couple of posts?

a) Depending on your definition of ""identity""; and that's what my last couple of posts have been about.  
b) *Not at all*, **if** you're being frozen for later biological repair. I said that last time.  

&gt; and heaven doesn't come with any specific doctrine about how to get there

I know you don't think that. However:  
a) all the bible-people disagree with you  
b) you've never really explained why Non-Documented Beliefs are any more reliable than Documented Beliefs; or for that matter, where they even come from.

Or at least, if you have, I've never come across those posts of yours.

&gt; you can believe that everyone gets to heaven regardless of what they do in this life

But that brings us right back to the core problem: what's the point of believing something if there's *no evidence whatsoever for believing it*? Or worse, there **is** *evidence that argues* **against** *believing in that something*?

I mean, why not just believe in seven-dimensional meta-pixies who can reverse entropy and have energy efficiencies greater than 100%?

'Cause you're gonna spend months trying to talk to these pixies when you could be putting up a solar panel instead.

&gt; and you can treat others with respect and kindness regardless of whether they share your belief

And I do. Right up to the point where they start pushing their provably-false beliefs *and their associated you-must-behave* packages on other people.

Hence, why I make sure I pull out my priestly ordination papers and start lecturing door-knocking evangelists on the parts of the bible they want to tell me about on early morning weekends.

To express this in the form of an analogy: I don't pull out my gun and start shooting, unless it's in self-defence and/or *they started first*.

Suggestions:

- I wouldn't have the horizontal bar at the top automatically scroll content left-to-right. I find that most users (including myself) don't like content scrolling automatically for them.

- I would tighten the navigation so that only the section titles show up and do away with the section descriptors. For the most part, it's largely self-explanatory what those sections are. They'll also help bring some of the content up further above the fold and make the navigation less chunky.

- I would consider making the blog post titles a bit bigger to establish more of a visual hierarchy.

- I would also consider making the copy on the right hand modules slightly bigger and increase the leading so that it's easier to read.

Here is my related story with all the boring details removed.

I was abused (physichally, raped, mentally) by a woman. The police did nothing at all to protect me or my son from her daily attacks. She found a new man (a reason to celebrate) but to guarantee custody, she left through a refuge claiming that I had hit her (without any bruises... except on her knuckles... where my head, nose gut etc would attack her)... Of course she was believed ex parte. She also got an ""occupation order"" where I was thrown out on the street, but required to keep up 100% of the rent on the property. She never returned to the property, preferring to move in with her new BF. All the time I lived on the street. I went to a mangina organization for help. I went there once for 30 minutes. They arranged the return of the house keys with the refuge.

A week later I met a sane woman and we started a relationship. Within a week of that relationship starting, the mangina counselor gossiped to my new GFs mother. I complained directly to the mangina organization. They replied in writing.. in fact the head of the mangina organization replied in writing, claiming that I was not a client. That 30 minutes did not mean I was under any counselor/client relationship. I kept the letter for 10 years thinking nothing more of it.

Ten years later, still going through the court system trying to see my son... I had 50/50 custody, but the insane ex refused to hand him over, and the police needed a court order to remove him so I could have my 50% custody. She decided to pull out the ""He sexually abused my son"" card, as she had used every other accusation and failed... We were all sent off to a court ordered psychiatrist. She was diagnosed as insane, but that did not matter to the court of course... I was cleared of all accusations, which did not matter of course.

What was surprising though is what happened in my first appointment with the psychiatrist. And it is a dire warning to ALL men about the abuse industry.

""So you have an anger management problem then?""
""No""
""You have an anger management problem""
""No""
""So you have a denial problem as well?""
""No""
Yes you do. I have it recorded here in the court history that you have been to anger management classes.""
""No I haven't""
""Yes you have""
""No I haven't""

This conversation went on for five minutes... I figured eventually that the mangina group had fraudulently put me on a list of men who had had counseling as they received thousands of dollars from the state for every man they counseled for anger management. I went home and got the letter from the mangina group to show the psychiatrist... he apologized profusely... and corrected the court history. I complained to the police repeatedly. The police did nothing. Mangina groups are allowed to commit fraud on random men.

You have been warned about mangina groups and the abuse industry.","1283301295"

1. All cell membranes have the same structural framework of two sheets of lipid molecules known as the lipid bilayer.

2. Eukaryotic cells have their genetic instructions distributed among several to many DNA molecules of different lengths.

3. A nucleus has two outer membranes, one wrapped around the other known as the nuclear envelope.

4. The endomembrane system is a series of functionally connected organelles in which lipids are assembled and new polypeptide chains are modified.

5. Peroxisomes, a type of vesicles, are sacs of enzymes that break down fatty acids and amino acids.

6. Living plant cells have a central vacuole, a fluid filled organelle that stores amino acids, sugars, ions, and toxic wastes, and helps the cell grow.

7. Microtubules function mainly in internal organization and in sustained, directional movements that move the cell structures and organelles into different locations.

8. Microfilaments reinforce a cell's shape, reconfigure the surface, anchor membrane proteins, and may serve in muscle contraction.

9. Cells move using motor proteins, flagella, or cilia.

10. Prokaryotic cells are the smallest known cells, have a semirigid or rigid cell wall that surrounds the plasma membrane, and a nucleus does not enclose its DNA.","1283301314"

Yes, most people cannot take this job, and that's why there's a large turnover rate at any restaurant. People do leave all the time, mostly because they can't take the shit from customers, also because they found a better restaurant.

Of course, I consider the money to be worth it. However, I am also one of the few servers who recognize the one true quality that makes a good server is not multi-tasking, or memory techniques, or foot speed, or people skills. These all help make the job go by easier.

It's shit-taking.

How much pointless shit can you have thrown at you and still take it? 

&gt;What if you were a stand up comedian and your jokes suck and you get heckled and the shit occasionally beat out of you because your jokes are offensive and not funny.

I get what you're trying to say and it is a good point, but this doesn't apply. The shit we take is rarely because we failed at our job. And it's when we failed at our job that it's easier to take because we know we screwed up, the customer is upset because of something we did, it's our bad, try not to do that to them the next time. That's easy to understand.

The majority of the shit we take has nothing to do with us, and 4 times out of 5 it is an unreasonable request or the customer is just trying to get some free stuff. 

It's almost unfathomable to try to understand how people can be so mean and downright insulting to another human being, especially when we're there to help you have a nice night.

EDIT: I don't know if you've ever worked as a server, I'm assuming by your attitude towards wait staff that you have not. But I think if you were to join us on a shift for one full day on a busy night, you'd be shocked at how much shit comes our way. Pointless crap, outright lies about us, unreasonable demands, people getting upset over trivial matters, laughing at us, and even (rarely) physical abuse.

And yes, we could get another line of work, but that's usually why we're waiting tables is because we're going to school in order to get a better line of work.

Some may argue that a tax abatement for $10 million and $80 million in infrastructure improvements qualify as defrauding the public but I would disagree.  Since the ballpark was completed, the area has turned into a lively area in SF with bars, restaurants and condos which bring in big tax dollars back to the City each year.  In addition, rent of $1.2 million is being collected each year .

Kill People Who Don't Listen to Priests

    Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death.  Such evil must be purged from Israel.  (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT)

Kill Witches

    You should not let a sorceress live.  (Exodus 22:17 NAB) 

Kill Homosexuals
    ""If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives.""  (Leviticus 20:13 NAB) 

Kill Fortunetellers

    A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death.  (Leviticus 20:27 NAB) 

Death for Hitting Dad

    Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death.  (Exodus 21:15 NAB) 

Death for Cursing Parents

    1) If one curses his father or mother, his lamp will go out at the coming of darkness.  (Proverbs 20:20 NAB)

    2) All who curse their father or mother must be put to death.  They are guilty of a capital offense.  (Leviticus 20:9 NLT) 

Death for Adultery

    If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death.  (Leviticus 20:10 NLT) 

Death for Fornication

    A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death.  (Leviticus 21:9 NAB) 

Death to Followers of Other Religions

    Whoever sacrifices to any god, except the Lord alone, shall be doomed.  (Exodus 22:19 NAB) 

Kill Nonbelievers

    They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.  (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB) 

Kill False Prophets

    If a man still prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall say to him, ""You shall not live, because you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord.""  When he prophesies, his parents, father and mother, shall thrust him through.  (Zechariah 13:3 NAB) 

Kill the Entire Town if One Person Worships Another God

    Suppose you hear in one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you that some worthless rabble among you have led their fellow citizens astray by encouraging them to worship foreign gods.  In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.  Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the street and burn it.  Put the entire town to the torch as a burnt offering to the LORD your God.  That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.  Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction.  Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you.  He will have compassion on you and make you a great nation, just as he solemnly promised your ancestors.  ""The LORD your God will be merciful only if you obey him and keep all the commands I am giving you today, doing what is pleasing to him.""  (Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT)

Kill Women Who Are Not Virgins On Their Wedding Night

    But if this charge is true (that she wasn't a virgin on her wedding night), and evidence of the girls virginity is not found, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her fathers house and there her townsman shall stone her to death, because she committed a crime against Israel by her unchasteness in her father's house.  Thus shall you purge the evil from your midst.  (Deuteronomy  22:20-21 NAB) 

Kill Followers of Other Religions.

    1) If your own full brother, or your son or daughter, or your beloved wife, or you intimate friend, entices you secretly to serve other gods, whom you and your fathers have not known, gods of any other nations, near at hand or far away, from one end of the earth to the other: do not yield to him or listen to him, nor look with pity upon him, to spare or shield him, but kill him.  Your hand shall be the first raised to slay him; the rest of the people shall join in with you.  You shall stone him to death, because he sought to lead you astray from the Lord, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that place of slavery.  And all Israel, hearing of this, shall fear and never do such evil as this in your midst.  (Deuteronomy 13:7-12 NAB) 

    2) Suppose a man or woman among you, in one of your towns that the LORD your God is giving you, has done evil in the sight of the LORD your God and has violated the covenant by serving other gods or by worshiping the sun, the moon, or any of the forces of heaven, which I have strictly forbidden.  When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, then that man or woman must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death.  (Deuteronomy 17:2-5 NLT) 

Death for Blasphemy

    One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father got into a fight with one of the Israelite men.  During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the LORD's name.  So the man was brought to Moses for judgment.  His mother's name was Shelomith. She was the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan.  They put the man in custody until the LORD's will in the matter should become clear.  Then the LORD said to Moses, ""Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard him to lay their hands on his head.  Then let the entire community stone him to death.  Say to the people of Israel: Those who blaspheme God will suffer the consequences of their guilt and be punished.  Anyone who blasphemes the LORD's name must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel.  Any Israelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the LORD's name will surely die.  (Leviticus 24:10-16 NLT) 

Kill False Prophets

    1) Suppose there are prophets among you, or those who have dreams about the future, and they promise you signs or miracles,  and the predicted signs or miracles take place.  If the prophets then say, 'Come, let us worship the gods of foreign nations,' do not listen to them.  The LORD your God is testing you to see if you love him with all your heart and soul.  Serve only the LORD your God and fear him alone.  Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him.  The false prophets or dreamers who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of slavery in the land of Egypt.  Since they try to keep you from following the LORD your God, you must execute them to remove the evil from among you.  (Deuteronomy 13:1-5 NLT) 

    2) But any prophet who claims to give a message from another god or who falsely claims to speak for me must die.'  You may wonder, 'How will we know whether the prophecy is from the LORD or not?'  If the prophet predicts something in the LORD's name and it does not happen, the LORD did not give the message.  That prophet has spoken on his own and need not be feared.  (Deuteronomy 18:20-22 NLT) 

Infidels and Gays Should Die

    So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired.  As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.  Instead of believing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies.  So they worshiped the things God made but not the Creator himself, who is to be praised forever.  Amen.  That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.  Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.  And the men, instead of having normal sexual relationships with women, burned with lust for each other.  Men did shameful things with other men and, as a result, suffered within themselves the penalty they so richly deserved.  When they refused to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their evil minds and let them do things that should never be done.  Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, fighting, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.  They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful.  They are forever inventing new ways of sinning and are disobedient to their parents.  They refuse to understand, break their promises, and are heartless and unforgiving.  They are fully aware of God's death penalty for those who do these things, yet they go right ahead and do them anyway.  And, worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.  (Romans 1:24-32 NLT) 

Kill People for Working on the Sabbath

    The LORD then gave these further instructions to Moses: 'Tell the people of Israel to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you forever.  It helps you to remember that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.  Yes, keep the Sabbath day, for it is holy.  Anyone who desecrates it must die; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.  Work six days only, but the seventh day must be a day of total rest.  I repeat: Because the LORD considers it a holy day, anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.'  (Exodus 31:12-15 NLT)

Contrast this with when you find yourself doing something cunning without having thought about it because something in you saw the chance, knew the meaning of the opportunity, and knew the way to take advantage, all without having to think or plan.  In other words, if a cunning action happens as an instinctive response, well, great.  When you say be smart, and don't be stupid, no doubt you mean this.  ","1283301377"

So learn business skills, and negotiate the terms in advance. And stop complaining -- you have to meet the customer's expectations, they don't have to meet yours. If you succeed, they will *want to pay you.* Anything else is fascism.

When I negotiated the terms for [Apple Writer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer), I thought a 25% royalty rate seemed fair. The people at Apple, somewhat naive and desperate to have a word processor for the Apple II, agreed.

Five years later I had made six million dollars off that one program.

&gt; ... but outright saying you should not charge for software is ridiculous.

*No one said that.* It happens to be the norm today. If you want to charge, go ahead and charge, but stop complaining that people won't pay.

This is in the nature of free markets -- you can't force people to meet your expectations. Have you considered trying to meet the expectations of software buyers?

"programming","t5_2fwo","I am not an economist but I am an [app developer](http://instaviz.com), so this is near and dear to me. The App Store exhibits the clear signs of a [Market for Lemons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_for_lemons): the seller knows far more than the buyer, and this essentially drives out the good sellers and collapses the market toward 0.

Consider the 5 cases in The Oatmeal:

You've been to Starbucks, you already know how good or bad the coffee is. You already know what sugar tastes like.

You've checked the trailers and what Ebert says so you know what the movie is like. Moreover if it's a franchise or sequel, you're actually more likely to go see it.

You can check out the iPhone or iPad yourself, it's a physical good. Before buying you can press buttons, make calls etc. in front of the salesman. Or you know what Apple products are like, and reviews exist that go down to the nth detail.

Now as for App Store apps... you have to take the word of an unknown developer that the app is any good. The reviews do not go into much depth on the app. There's no way to try out the app before purchase. In other words, the app developer knows far more about the app than the purchaser.

Still, despite the obvious signs of the Market for Lemons, what are the best marketing techniques? Precisely the ones that reverse the information asymmetry: [offering a lite version](http://blog.appstorehq.com/post/103207193/iphone-app-marketing-what-works-and-what-doesnt), in-app store purchases etc.

While I've been hoping for a proper trial API from Apple, I thought about creating an alternate trial app store, where you could trial app store apps without paying but you get the full functionality for a limited time. It wouldn't be Cydia or jailbreakland, since I would want it to be legal and looked upon kindly by Apple. It would work off the [Enterprise Distribution Program](http://developer.apple.com/programs/iphone/enterprise/) and get developers to opt-in. But I don't know if it would work anymore under the latest SDK agreements.

TL;DR: maybe the low prices for apps is not the cause, but the effect. The cause is lack of good quality information about the app. I'm all for a trial API or trial store.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;That's why we have continent-spanning power grids, spare capacity, and dispatchaple (sic) power sources like hydro.

You make my point for me. Wind power NEEDS other sources of power, or it is not viable.  Thorium could replace it all.  You still need, by the way, to get the grid to the windmill.  If the grid is near a windy place, great.  If not, and most of the untapped places for wind worldwide, such as offshore, are a not.  You think the grid is huge now?  Go with wind.

&gt;Wind power kills tens of thousands of birds a year.  Glass windows kill hundreds of millions.  Cats kill billions.

http://www.dailytech.com/Study+Wind+Farms++Bird+Killers/article18641.htm

Already, the main wind farm in California is the leading cause of Golden Eagle deaths in the country every year.

And buildings and cats do kill gazillions of birds each year.  Why make the problem worse?

&gt;We won't stop the Earth from rotating.

That's just silly.  Of course we won't.  But our planet's atmosphere is a huge heat engine.  It absorbs solar radiation, heats up, which causes convection, thus wind.  A wind mill captures the kinetic energy of the wind for conversion to electrical energy.  When this happens, the atmosphere has a little less energy then before.  How deep is the well?  How much energy CAN be removed from Earth's atmosphere before there is an effect?  What would that effect be?  How much of a problem is this?

NOBODY KNOWS.  These are questions that has had, to the best of my knowledge, ZERO research conducted in order to ascertain an answer.

How many times does mankind have to leap without looking first?

&gt;In practice, actual maintenance costs are tiny.  They're set up once, don't need touching for decades.

Totally untrue.  Here is an excellent scientific paper with references that graphically outlines SOME of the maintenance issues windmills face, along with the rebuttal for your next point about high wind use countries like Denmark.

Also, if not ROUTINELY maintained, they are VERY prone to fire, collapse, and blade failure.

&gt;[Not the usable kind.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium_fuel_cycle#Disadvantages_as_nuclear_fuel)  Old designs were abandoned for a reason-it's decades of research to get where you want, and nobody will fund it as by the time you'd get some electricity, it will be far to plentiful to bother.

The article you cite makes many of my points for me.  As for your ""too plentiful to bother"" electricity, you, and the experts, all agree that wind need to be backed up by other power sources in order to be viable.

By the end of next year, or early in 2012, Earth will exceed the 7 billion mark in population.  By 2050, the population of Earth will exceed 10 billion.  Consider the following chart:

http://www.treehugger.com/World-Population-Growth-2050.JPG

Note that MORE than 85% of this population will live in UNDEVELOPED areas; ie, THE PLACES WITHOUT A GRID.
Wind power CANNOT POSSIBLY keep up with this type of explosive growth.

Thorium power can.

Are there technical challenges ahead?  Yes, hence we need to start now.

Here is a link to an outstanding Google Tech talk about Thorium power, and the technological hurdles that remain.

I am stating it as an example of what happens if this 'respect the beliefs' idea is taken to its logical extreme).

That said, I don't have to agree with someones beliefs in order to respect the beliefs.  I can disagree with somebody who thinks that Obama is a poor president because he hasn't made immigration a high enough priority, and still respect the logic and path that they have taken to get to that position.  The fact that we each place different values upon certain priorities obviously changes our conclusions on the topic, but I can respect the accuracy of the persons position from within their worldview.  I can even respect their individual belief/worldview and still disagree with it if I find the reasons for the belief, or the path taken to it, to be deserving of respect.  Sticking with my friend who thinks immigration issues should be a higher priority, I don't have to agree with that idea to respect it as a position.

This idea of respecting something even while disagreeing with it is, I believe, the origin of the mistaken idea that we should just respect everything.","1283301477"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Don't sweat downvotes, chalk it up to bots. Looks like the Creatives claim a wider frequency response, but I have a feeling that most (all?) headphone manufacturers fudge those numbers.  There's no way earbuds will output frequencies that low, so I always take those numbers with a grain of salt.

&gt;**Frequency response**  

&gt;Frequency-response specifications in full-size loudspeakers are generally pretty useless in predicting sound quality, but headphone frequency-response numbers are even worse. Manufacturers have routinely exaggerated frequency-response figures to the point that they're irrelevant. Even the flimsiest, cheap headphones routinely boast extremely low bass-response performance--15Hz or 20Hz--but almost always sound lightweight and bright. Generally, bass buffs will be happier sticking with larger 'phones.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; And if two people make an agreement that one of them will use birth control, one person should not be able to change the agreement without notifying the other partner.

But what do you mean by ""should not be able to change""?  The agreement in the first place is not a legally binding one so any change to it is de facto legal, which means that in fact any partner may change it at any time whatsoever.  Your agreement with Geico, on the other hand, is a legally binding written contract and so the rules governing it are different.

&gt;I think the woman can already do an adoption

The father must also consent to an adoption and if the identity of the father is unknown, the state is required to make a good-faith effort to find him.  A man who would sabotage his partner's birth control in order to conceive a child is likely to be eager to make himself known -- at which point, the woman could give up custody to him but would still be required to pay child support.  So, my question still applies.

&gt;As a hypothetical, if the man had a signed agreement with the woman that she would be responsible for birth control, and later she confessed that she had (intentionally or negligently) failed to use the birth control. There would need to be proof that she agreed to be solely responsible for birth control, as well as proof that she did not fulfill her responsibility.

I'm not saying this as any sort of personal attack, but: this standard of proof is so high as to be completely impractical.  That doesn't mean that I disagree that it's the right standard -- I think it is -- but realistically this situation will almost never occur.  The number of people who would be willing to sign such an agreement in the first place is small and the number of people who would confess to not using BC when just saying that it failed or that they used it imperfectly would be almost an unverifiable claim is even smaller.

&gt;she did nothing wrong if she breaks the agreement and doesn't tell you?

I think that's morally wrong, but I think that it's a situation that does not merit government intervention.  No, I don't think that someone should be able to contract their rights *or* responsibilities as a citizen to anyone else excepting cases of physical inability to fulfill those responsibilities (I'm referring to such cases as when power of attorney comes into play for e.g. medical decisions).","1283301538"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The galaxy is moving at about 300 km/sec and the sun is moving at about 250 km/sec. Since it takes 250 million years to orbit the galaxy it's safe to say the sun doesn't move much in relation to the milky way during 50. Still, it is moving through space ridiculously fast. To be conservative, let's assuming the the Sun which moves tangentially in relation to the center of the galaxy, is perpendicular to the direction of the movement of the center, and that it is moving in the opposite direction, so its moving only 50km/sec when all's said and done. 50 km/sec * 60 sec/min * 60 min/hour * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year * 50 years = 78.8 *10^9 km. In the opposite case, where the Sun is moving in the same direction as the galaxy, you get 867*10^9 km. That is 5700 times the diameter of the solar system. (525 for the smaller estimate)

So yeah, it would probably be a huge challenge to get an accurate calculation, consider we are talking about as much as a trillion km difference between points. Furthermore, as generic_human_1979 pointed out, my calculations don't even take into account velocity, which is just as much of a problem since we are moving ridiculously fast through space as well, and the angle change would be enormous even if you could teleport to the position of the earth.","1283301539"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I personally am not against the legalisation of marijuana, I think what people do in their own time is up to them. But I am concerned that making it legal means people will begin smoking it publicly. Now second hand cigarette smoke has not been proven to actually harm people, but second hand marijuana smoke certainly can affect people around you. I don't want to be affected by someone else's drug taking. I don't want to worry that I am slightly high and my motor skills are reduced and shouldn't be driving a car etc just because I went out in public where there is the possibility that people may be smoking it. And what happens if someone gets into a car accident and after tests, are shown to have a small amount of marijuana in their system? Will they be held accountable for unknowingly ingesting a drug? Also, who's going to make the laws about how far away from children you will be allowed to smoke? As of the moment people have to hide the fact they would even have marijuana on them, but when you're allowed to have it on you, people will be bolder and smoke it not caring who is around them because they won't get in trouble.

So to sum it up, pot smoke can affect people around you, not just the smoker. If you could get it in pill form or something that isolates the effects to the user only, then that would be better, because I don't want to, at any time, unknowingly ingesting a drug that can impair my motor skills and brain function.","1283301565"

No, the F-22 isn't painted with a radar-absorbent paint, it has a coating (think the clear-coat on your car) that is both radar scattering and absorbent. The paint itself was actually designed to decrease its physical visibility to be seen, as in you looking up and seeing a plane.

Yes, other planes achieved supercruise. The marvel is that the F/A-22 damn near reaches Mach 2 in supercruise.

Most early warning detection systems don't rely on radar alone, but a combination of radar, infrared, radio frequency detection mechanisms. The fact that the F/A-22's signature on current radar systems is roughly the same as a swarm of bees, combined with the fact that it can travel fast as fuck with little heat signature, and it frequency hops and uses a wider bandwidth of frequencies in its targeting/locking of enemies all contribute to its lack of gay pride parade attention.

And I don't own a car, so I don't feel like I should have to help pay for their parking lot. don't mind if something that was complimentary is now pay-per-use.  Let the people who use the service pay for it. Same with paying for luggage on a flight. And meals. I'm not going to eat your shitty airline meal, and I'm not checking any luggage, even if it were free. Let the people who use those services pay for them. Don't bump up everyone's fees regardless. 

And I know what I'll get in reply: ""But they aren't passing the savings on to you, they're just charging more to others."" Whatever. I hate it when people abuse complimentary services, and it ruins it for everyone. That's what happened with the airlines. They're charging because they have to ... airlines know they get shitty word of mouth when they start making services like this cost. They know people hate it when they charge, but they're doing it because of competition.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you'll permit me...I'll tell you a story.


I have two sisters....one younger by a couple years...one older. Your sister sounds *just like* my older sister.

When we were little, my older sister bullied me mercilessly. She had a real talent for picking up on people's insecurities and just hammering them over the head mercilessly with it.

My younger sister is a pushover, as well as my mom, and my older sister would manipulate them as much as possible.

When my parents left us alone, my sisters would come up with elaborate lies about stuff I had done....and my parents would simply believe them because there was 2 of them, and why would they lie. My parents actually called the police a few times based on things my sisters told them.


When my older sister was 16, she got a car. Up until she moved out at 21v(and when she moved back in again at times), she had everything. She got to do whatever she wanted. She had the biggest room in the house, in fact it was a garage that had been converted to an apartment. She flitted from crappy job to crappy job...with long spaces in between. 

I on the other hand, always ended up with the ass end of things. I never got a car from my parents, or even help buying one. I was held to all the rules. I got the smallest room. I wasn't allowed to do any of the things my Sister was allowed to, even when I reached her age.

I had to get a job as soon as I was able in order to get spending money....and I pitched in around the house.

I hated....**HATED** my older sister for a long time. I wasted a lot of energy being bitter about it, and feeling self-righteous just like you. 

Then I sort of came to realize that I actually had it better. I moved out at 19, got a good job. Now in my late 20's I'm doing good while my 30 year old sister is struggling with crappy jobs and living with her abusive boyfriend.

I realized she was such a bitch because she was miserable and hated her self.

I truly feel sorry for her.


I'm not saying your sister is exactly the same, or that the situation doesn't require intervention....but I'm not sure what sort of answers you expect here.

It's not up to you. The only thing you **CAN** do is talk to your parents about it. Be supportive of them and your sister. As much as it irks you, try to feel some compassion for her....because she's on her way down and you're on your way up.","1283301606"

In fact that was all the man cared for, he worked his job so he could afford something to eat, he had the occasional nap on a falling apart couch, and he helped Cloud on his mission!  The hours ticked by, into days, nay i say even weeks? The time came for Cloud to fight the demon, t'was the demon Sephiroth! From the heavens came a scream that chanted his name and looked into your very soul! Cloud and Sephiroth clashed for what seemed like hours but in the end there could be only one! The nameless man wept with joy as Cloud banished the demon Sephiroth. Immediately after little Clouds victory, the man pulled out the most gigantic joint my eyes have ever seen!

We don't even get our first list of the New Testament books we use today until almost the 5th century.

I think everything is political and holding office is just a job title, those people aren't being any more or less political than those running Koch Industries. Economic self interest is more an end, politics can be the means (one of the means) so I don't see any dichotomy/competition between the two.

""As the information becomes decentralized, this is less and less true. The internet, and specifically sites like reddit make it a near impossibility.""

I think you over rate Reddit, though I generally agree with you on the point I think most governments are now making an attempt to re-centralize information. Whether or not they succeed remains to be seen.

""See this is what perplexes me. You complain about free market capitalism and then go on to criticize corporatism. Corporations lobby congress because it is in their interest - because congress has appropriated itself regulatory power over all aspects of our economy. If that power did not exist, no corporation would have a reason to lobby and they would be forced to face the competitive pressures of the market.

Congress tries to regulate and tax and control more and more aspects of our lives and it provides the incentive for individuals to go out and seek political influence instead of seek private profits. Then people wonder why corporations gain power. Of course they would! When you use the force of government against one group, that group learns that in order to fight it must use the government for its own purposes. So all you get are groups vying for the coercive power of the state. Growing that state will exacerbate that problem. Limiting the government's power will limit that drive for individuals to dominate.""

I guess it depends on what you define complaining as. Every system is going to have flaws, if talking about them is complaining then you can say I complain about everything.
I can totally agree we end up with groups vying for persuasion/coercion over the state and I'm not advocating bigger gov't to solve it.","1283301751"

Because glutamate is absorbed very quickly in the gastrointestinal tract (unlike glutamic acid-containing proteins in foods), glutamate could spike blood plasma levels of glutamate.[14][15][16] Glutamic acid is in a class of chemicals known as excitotoxins, high levels of which have been shown in animal studies to cause damage to areas of the brain unprotected by the blood-brain barrier and that a variety of chronic diseases can arise out of this neurotoxicity.[17][18]  There has been debate among scientists on the significance of these findings since the early 1970s, when John Olney found that high levels of glutamic acid caused damage to the brains of infant mice.[19]  The debate is complex and has focused mainly on whether the increase in plasma glutamate levels from typical ingestion levels of glutamate is enough to cause neurotoxicity and on whether humans are susceptible to the neurotoxicity from glutamic acid seen in some animal experiments.

Here's the [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid_%28flavor%29#Research_into_health_effects). If you look at the health concerns section on MSG, it redirects to the article on Glutamic acid (which talks about all glutamate salts, including MSG).","1283301765"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Here's my story: I was age 19, not in a stable relationship, and have medical issues that might have complicated the pregnancy. My parents made it clear that they thought having a kid under those circumstances was unwise. I was under general, but woke up about 10 minutes after it was over thinking it took about as much time to end the pregnancy as it had to start it.  I didn't have any mental or physical ill-effects, and I did everything I could to make damn sure I would never be in that position again.  That was 26 years ago, and I'm now married with two kids that were planned and are very much the products of a healthy, stable, loving relationship. It is, I believe, the greatest gift one can give a child, and it breaks my heart how many don't get it.  I don't believe that raising a kid without a partner is a universally bad idea, but it makes the job a lot tougher to do really well, in my experience. Doing so as a consequence of active, conscious decisions (as opposed to circumstances beyond one's control, such as death of a partner) strikes me as selfish, frankly.  I'm sorry I allowed myself to have an unplanned pregnancy with someone I wasn't prepared to commit to, but I'm not particularly sorry I terminated it.  I don't know if there is such thing as a soul, or heaven, or judgment day, so I don't spend a lot of time worrying about the karmic scoreboard.  I have to think that if those things exist, God/Allah/Yahweh/FSM *and* that ""baby"" will know that I did what I thought was best for everyone.

Anyway, *projection* is a flighty word in mathematics. People use it for a lot of stuff. Although there is a bijection from a plane onto a sphere, there cannot be a *continuous* bijection of a sphere onto a plane, so any topologically meaningful bijection serving as an equivalence of these two spaces does not exist (but removing a point on the sphere leads to a more-than-topological bijection!)","1283301781"

Start with your concept of ""crowd"".  If temes are technological replicators, data such as javascript libraries or SQL statements are temes.  Whereas humans may err, notice how non-human temetic hosts are extremely reliable comparatively, and getting more so by the second.  Functions are optimized.  Bugs/exploits in code get removed, and in the meantime antivirus software protects systems fairly robustly.  That is, in a nutshell, temes outcompeting less efficient or erroneous temes/memes for host space.  An outright lie has zero positives and many negatives for both temes and their hosts, by the temes' standards.

And please recall that the act of sitting and spelling words correctly at your computer shows a vast lineage of temetic progress that has greatly affected *you*, the fallible human host of memes, temes, and genes alike.  And it is an ongoing process - you are being changed from a host of any old meme with little immunology, into a host of temes with a very strong memetic immune system.

"programming","t5_2fwo","For all those saying Apple should put refunds into the App Store, I'd like to point out that if an app is ""returned"" (which is possible at the moment), Apple takes back the FULL price from the developer.

That is, you buy an app, and pay 99c. Apple takes a 29c processing fee and pays the dev 70c. Say you don't like the app, so you ""return"" it. Apple gives you back your 99c, and subtracts that 99c from the dev's account. So the dev just LOST 29c, or nearly 50% of the proceeds of his next sale, because you didn't care for their app.

I would say that if Apple were to make the refunds process easier, like some are asking for, the App Store would shed developers PDQ.

 But when i was told i was infertile and  would never have children it completely changed my perspective. After years of trying I gave up completely and stopped all treatments because my fertility doctor told me i couldn't have a child. 
That's when my perspective changed. 
 when I met my current husband he knew I couldn't have kids.... But lo and behold we got pregnant months later. Anyway long story short after i heard a baby's heartbeat I absolutely hated myself for ever thinking That abortion was okay In the past.

Or do you mean change the current new FAQ to just be links to threads?

Personally things that are lists are easier to see at a glance if they're just on the main page, rather than having to go through one page per genre, for example. The nature of Reddit is that irrelevant but funny posts will be upvoted and will contribute to the noise, and will make it harder for people to find the info.

But having said that, doing a mix of the two ideas might be appropriate. Maybe stuff like the glossary of terms (which I haven't yet transferred to the new FAQ) could be separate threads, and I'd also like to link to some general /r/rpg threads that had some good discussion. Kind of like a best of /r/rpg sort of thing.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Hey -- Libertarian here, so take it for what it's worth: 

Democrats do have some kind of weird fascination with Palin.  Here democrats have all the marbles -- the Senate, the House, the Presidency, and yet Palin writes a Tweet --  A **tweet** mentioning 'death panels' and liberals and their media allies go apeshit for weeks on the issue.   I don't know, but I think most elected politicians in national office would love to have that kind of power.   You're at best a state governor, if not a minor journalist, you write a 125  character post in a media that is known for its superficiality and it ties up the entire ruling establishment for weeks?  Give me some of that!   And the thing is, it's not Palin per se that created this power -- it's the sheer obsessive hatred that the liberal grassroots has for her that gives it to her.   

My perception is that dems and/or liberals have this minority mindset whereby they are so focused on running for office they can't really grasp the concept that they're the Man, now.   They're so conditioned on the three-minute hate of whomever it is they hate this week that they tend to do that instead of move their agenda forward.   

And this isn't unique for Palin.   Reason Magazine had an article outlining the weird obsession Dems used to have for Coulter -- [Ann Coulter, Bitch Goddess](http://reason.com/archives/2002/10/01/bitch-goddess).  tldr:  Liberals you funny.

We do. It's hard. The USDA basically represents the interests of food producers, not consumers (and certainly not animals).

However, I think there has been a lot of progress recently, not in terms of government action but just in terms of consumers becoming more aware and demanding better practices from producers.

I'm very much in favor of this, as I said above. However, I also think it's important to reduce the *quantity* of meat I eat, for health and ecological reasons, and a personal belief that killing animals for my personal enjoyment is immoral.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It certainly wouldn't be an easy project. More of a thought exercise, really.

Imagine a universe in which the world really was 6,000 years old. The Grand Canyon was formed in about 5 minutes by a Biblical flood. Dinosaur bones were buried by the devil to mislead man. These things would certainly be wonky but the mind really starts to boggle when you talk about some of the more relavent claims Christians make.

Evolution doesn't occur. Modern medicine is powerless against disease, vaccines are fundamentally broken, and any species taken out of its respective habitat will die or be forever disadvantaged.

The only meaning life has is to serve a vindictive, evil and cruel deity who now has a monopoly on healing, science, and life itself. Mankind is of little to no worth. Everyone is a sinner. All that matters is God. Eventually, mankind fades with irrelevance after a series of attempts to reclaim power from God, as is our nature. Then God is left to sit and entertain himself. HE HIMSELF now lacks purpose, which was to babysit us and make himself feel good. He now realizes that purpose was empty. To entertain himself while he tries to come up with something else to do, he pops three lesbians into existence and makes them fuck so he can get off. He forces them to continue for eternity and he watches them, wondering why he didn't just do this from the start.

Therefore, if Christianity were true, there would be no humans aside from three lesbians doing it for God's amusement. We exist and the fabled lesbian three-way does not. Therefore God does not exist. QED","1283301981"

What if an arcane mage doesn't put any talent points into hit talents on his offspec too, and claims that this build is his offspec, even in the same tree? I mean, they do differ significantly, and the gear they require is different, since 3% hit, or 6% hit means a lot in terms of gear. Moreover, the difference between these two arcane specs in terms of gear would be greater than between cookie-cutter arcane and say frostfire build - as far as gear needed is concerned

Which is why MS should mean main role, otherwise people will game the system. For a certain role, all items can be used reasonably on any imaginable spec which reflects that role. However, a druid for example will most likely not re-use  his gear between roles.

Also, who is to say which items should go with which main tree? We actually had an insane dps-ers, with a crazy dk spec, that made no sense to almost anybody, and he was top dps - my point being that there is a lot of customization possible, and, regarding the initial topic, calling certain items as beyond that initial talent build makes no sense","1283301986"

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","&gt; Enlighten us.

Okay, sure.

We have a single sample, and we're trying to predict (say by an interval) another observation from that same process. We could treat it as a tolerance interval or we could treat it like a prediciton interval. 

The three suggestions  below relate to a prediction interval approach.

1) If we assume a distribution, then in many cases we can form a pivotal quantity (or, more strictly, a quantity like a pivotal quantity but which doesn't depend on the parameter(s) ), and from that construct an interval. I can give examples if you can't see how to do that. (It is, for example in the case of a normal model, a special case of a prediction interval in regression, where one has only an intercept term. In some cases we can do similar calculations in more general cases; it's possible to do it approximately in many more cases, e.g. by using methodology that allows the construction of approximately pivotal quantities.)

2) We can use simulation to work out intervals from assumed distributional models which incorporate the contribution of both the uncertainty in the parameter estimates and the distribution of the data.

3) where one doesn't make a distributional assumption, one can use resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrapping) to construct prediction intervals for another observation from the process that produced the sample. In the case of the bootstrap there's two stages of resampling involved to quantify both the variation in the parameter estimates (parameter uncertainty) and the variation in the observations.

&gt; Maybe you didn't read the last paragraph.

My problem is that flowcharts quite similar to this end up taped up on the filing cabinets or cubicles of people working with data (often with only a modicum of training) quite separated from the caveats (like those) that should accompany them. I have seen many such. Word of mouth explanations of them don't carry the caveats either. 

That's not to say such flowcharts have no value - they certainly do - but they also contribute to an attitude to statistical analysis that cause a lot of problems as well.","1283302031"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You're right. It is still there.

Hmm, well, for both of us (correct me if I'm wrong and I hope you don't mind me being candid here) I think it just hasn't occurred to us. Why that is so, I guess, is the question. Of course we come in all types, but for those of us who just feel/look normal (not like a male model or something), we have no reason to just *exude* confidence all the time. Are black men and white women more sexually aggressive? Seems unlikely. (Though I can say for sure that many of the white women I've been with have been very aggressive.) When I was in middle school (in Texas) I learned through the grape vine that this girl Taneisha (a black girl) had the hots for me. My first reason was to be *surprised*. ""Really? That's weird,"" I thought. I didn't even know who she was. Didn't have a face to put to the name. But it was a big school and a big class and a big network of friends (that maybe we were at opposite ends of, but still both in, both friends with many of the same people). I guess she'd seen me around and heard things about me. So, I eventually found out who she was, and we actually started dating, but then this one time, our friends began pressuring us to kiss, in front of everybody, and we didn't even know each other that well yet, and it just felt like such an *experiment* on the part of other people that we were like ""No, fuck you guys."" And we didn't kiss. And she was really attractive. But we just broke up because... I don't know. Middle schoolers are fickle. Maybe my not being the one with eyes for her first played into it. 

But from then on (even more so recently) I've been *taking that extra moment* to consider girls of other races, but mostly black girls, who I wouldn't normally think were interested in me and have been surprised by how many have been doing the same with me, or have returned my smile or flirty disposition. 

But why it takes that *extra moment*, I don't know. Perhaps it's a long history. I think it's social. And I'm sure we will get beyond it.

What about you? Why do you think the difference exists?","1283302050"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It depends.  I actively avoided ""hooking up"" for my first three years in college.  I had a lot of trouble getting good grades in my freshman year (the first time) so I left school and tried to make it in the working world.  After I figured out that the good jobs seemed to always go to the college grad, I entered school again.

One of the big distractions in my first attempt was women. I dated a couple of girls and ditched classes and studying to be with them. Fun, but bad for grades. When I went back, I decided to hold of dating until I had a good chance of graduating.

So in the last part of my junior year, I had a buddy who had a problem; he had a girl that was mooning over him and would not leave him alone.  I said that what he needed was for someone to capture her attention away from him. She'd dump him for the new guy, leaving him free to move on.  He thought that was a great idea, but didn't know anyone who could do that for him.  I bragged (somewhat stupidly) that I could.  Girls were easy, just pay them a little attention and have a positive attitude and they'd follow you anywhere.  He called me on it, essentially telling me to prove it.  It was Thursday.

On Friday, I introduced myself to her.  By Saturday night we were naked and sweating in my tent in a campsite in the John's Mountain state park.  Of course, on Sunday her father had the police out looking for me, but that's another story. (To forestall the obvious questions, he did not know that she'd decided to go camping with me, her roommate had only told him that we went out on a date.  He decided to call her room at midnight to see how her date went.  He then called back at 6 am, then noon.  By four Sunday evening when we got back he thought I'd kidnapped her.) My point is that it can be done, and college is the easiest place on the planet to score.

Be confident in yourself and pay attention to the girl.  Women really want someone who will listen to them and doesn't feel the need to talk about themselves all the time.  Don't bother trying to date a different girl every weekend, that just gets you a reputation as a womanizer.  Find a girl who appeals to you and try to be a decent guy.  If you hook up, great!  If it's a one night stand, that's good, but if it turns into something more, even better.

i do have work online, but am reluctant to post it here as others in my office are Redittors

Best project hands down is my current one, worst project would have to be a launch title on the Xbox called Nightcaster, terrible terrible game

No, I don't play my own games, mainly because we play them so much during development there just isn't any interest after launch.

The work flow is complex and time consuming. Politics, buggy tools, long long hours. It is rewarding when everything works though. Concepts come in on time, construction and worldbuilding follow, then bugs and polish.

Working in the industry for a long time doesn't mean that a person will work on a hit. That being said, I shipped an MMO for Sony that did very well, but was absolutely KILLED by WOW.

Things have changed very fast in the industry becuase of technology and the onslaught of the console wars. The playstation and the xbox completely changed the landscape of the industry, but made it easier to find a job. Staying relevant mainly means embracing new tools and working fast. Quality is always the desired result, so if you don't know the tools, someone else will pass you by.","1283302095"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","First of all, swap away some of the negging-- unless you're dealing with tens, it isn't strictly necessary (although it does make it easier). It's actually counterproductive the lower down the scale you go-- this is just a method to get through bitch-shields by showing your cocky enough, confident enough, and in control enough to give them shit. It's play-ground tactics, though effective.

If the idea is ""be the exception to the rule,"" does it require that you be negative to be exceptional?

Beneath the technology, there are core principles you can work from that are more important:

A) focus on your core identity and frame. Create the reality you live in, where you *are* just an awesome guy and these women *naturally* want to be with you. I patterned myself off the nicest natural I know, a guy who would never exploit a woman's feelings even while getting more ass that I could have believed-- and he never had to lie, either. He was just an awesome guy (the fact that you are already handsome puts you at an advantage in stepping away from negative aspects of the game). If you act as if you are best friends with a woman and are natural and congruent, you *will be* best friends. If your core identity is comfortable touching a girl with seductive purpose, it's no longer kino. If your core identity is comfortable with whispering in her ear, with making friends with her friends, with the idea that you are a lover and not just a pick-up artist, you *are* those things. If you do not deceive a woman, if, from the beginning, you are nothing more than a guy offering great experiences, *you will be that.*

Example: when i used to work clubs (got an LTR, lost it, am now working my way back-- inner game, first), I'd look for the beautiful second, the bored first; my motto was: ""I can make this night *better.*"" A beautiful bored woman just wants what a shy guy wants: someone to talk to her, explore her a bit. Someone to make the night memorable.

Of course, you want to break through to the rapport section before you start diving deep, but you get my drift.

You can use indirect approaches, pivet off her friends or even push-pull without being an asshole about it. Most of us just call it ""flirting."" It's when you put it on paper that people think it's negative.

B) think more of manipulating the situation than individual people. I would circle a club, using others as pivots: temporary friends, feeding off my positive energy while building up my social proof. I gave them energy and banter, they gave me an army. By the time I moved in a target, I was already half-way through-- and all without having to *attack* anything. 

Less Karate, more Tai Chi, feel me?

C) As you've read The Game and other such works, I assume you realize the power of building narratives. Take it the next level: creating perfect dates, creating memorable evenings, being the lover a woman always wanted and, frankly, openly, advertising yourself as such. With congruency, all things are possible.


tl:dr Fix your core identity, create a positive energy (negs are effective but you're moving beyond that now), hold to a world view (frame) where this woman would be silly NOT to be want to be around you (because most people are boring and you're there to bring some excitement) and, most of all, be someone who GIVES value to people, even if only for an evening.","1283302111"

I absolutely agree with you on this.  I think it's a little more subtle than just 'declining standards' though.  I believe that a lot of the decline traces with the rise of the following issues:  Artificially protecting children from learning to deal with failure so as to 'not damage their self images'; The rising tide of anti-intellectualism and the increasing devaluation of intellect and education;  The increasing focus on 'productivity' and the idea of education as an 'investment' driving schools at all levels to shift focus increasingly to just giving straight 'skill training' degrees instead of teaching people how to think and reason.

It's curious that you didn't find anyone that speaks English. There are loads of English speakers in the more residential Asian side's urban centers, and also in the European side, if you were to ask a random young person walking down the street, at a central location, I'm almost 100% sure they'd speak English.

Istanbul's traffic is something it shares with many big cities, but yeah. It does seem pretty chaotic for an outside eye. You adjust to it, in time. :)

&gt; I might add that I actually bought a Qur'an while in Istanbul - partly as a souvenir for being in (almost) the middle east, and partly because I want to understand our differences.

I gotta tell ya, the Turkish brand of Islam is nothing like what you will find in that book. Yes, I'm an atheist, but even if I weren't, my opinion would likely be the same. Take this into account while you read. ^^ 

Many of us, who identify themselves as Muslims are [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Muslim), and not [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim).

I hear Beirut, Kuwait, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Cairo and Tel Aviv &amp; Jerusalem are very nice destinations to go to if you want to experience the ""modern"" middle east. I've been to Dubai, it was like a city-wide construction site, but observing the people / social dynamics was amazing.

 Because it's true.

 There is no BS with my relationship with 'ol girl S3 ( I nicknamed her, ""Jezebel""). We're either seriously hot or, sometimes, completely cold.  

 But let me tell you, brother - when I open her up on some random Tuesday, on some desolate stretch where even GPS asks WTF?, she makes me happy.

 Sure, she doesn't cuddle me at night (though if there was a way, I'd do it). She doesn't actually say, ""I love you."" But barring that, it's the closest thing to True Love I've ever known.

The only difference is *Jersey Shore*, which makes it okay for the suburban wannabes to look and act like my South Philly neighbors.  If Philly Mag bothered going to some of the SP mainstays, they'd find the *Jersey Shore* crowd on display 24/7, only without all the attention whoring.

Rittenhouse's current douchestrosity is largely due to the people who found their initial success in Old City -- Drinker's, Continental, Stephen Starr. Drinker's is an especially sad/infurating tale since they founded themselves at 2nd &amp; Market as a place to escape the black-dress-wearing, cosmo-drinking crowd popularized by *Sex and the City* and its ilk.  Then that malcontent from *Real World* had to fucking blow up the spot and set in motion the events that led to the current state of Philadelphia's downtown bar scene -- Rittenhouse opened its arms to douches, the douches left Old City, and the Snookis moved in.

The **real** truth is that these ""trashy bars"" as you call them aren't going to get closed down. Rittenhouse will always attract dumb people with too much money, and Old City South of Market has been zoned as Philadelphia's own Hoboken. 

I'm as sad as you are that the Khyber is gone, but it's a little hypocritical of you to call places like 32, P&amp;S, and other places mentioned in the article ""trashy"" while putting the Khyber on a pedestal, simply because you like different music.  The Khyber sold its fair share of $4 PBR pounders before its unsuccessful attempt to reinvent itself as a craft beer bar. It was as trashy as the other places mentioned, only its customers wore a different uniform.

I read a book written by a collection of women who were at one point pro-life, but had a range of things happen to them, and changed their perspectives once they were put into a situation where they realized it was the right thing for them to do.

My entire philosophy is that is a choice, because no one can make the decision for you. I strongly respect that you could never do that, and I would never expect you to no matter what the scenario was. I am not one of those people that will say, ""Poor minorities should just have abortions, they have too many kids"".

"politics","t5_2cneq","There's a whole lot of mights there. It just appears to me that electing your judges is practically asking them to be political in their judgements. Suddenly they have a constituency and donors which they need to pay attention to.

The way we do it in the UK is that we have a commission of fifteen people composed of judges of varying seniority, lawyers, magistrates (who are volunteers in the UK) and laypeople who choose a candidate by open competition (references, interviews, case studies, simulated court environments, etc). That candidate is presented to a politician who can approve or reject the candidate but must publicly state why if s/he rejects the candidate.

In terms of rebuking judges, I think it would be odd to claim that they feel no sympathy with the people on whose behalf they judge. I'm fairly sure I read something the other week about how judges even in the UK are influenced by the media response to a case. So even when we do come to a situation where the judgement is wrong, the public can complain and a politician and the most senior judge have the power to remove him upon investigation and agreement.

It's not perfect and I wouldn't ever claim it is. But I much prefer that to any system that forces judges to accept donations and campaign to a constituency to ensure his survival in office.","1283302213"

Also, the Japanese mindset was that every civilian was honor bound to fight if need be, which is why it was such a big deal when Japan surrendered.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Don't get me wrong: I'm not suggesting ""rational"" discussion.

For issues like what you describe (fear that the US becomes a socialist nation), there is no rationality available. You have to drill down and find out what the fear is and why it exists.

The interesting point in what your mother says is not ""liberal agenda"". Asking her to explain what exactly is in the liberal agenda and how it would come to be realized would be unproductive, because as she would reach the end of reasoning and become aware of it, she'd have to go to yelling at you, dismissing you, or other nasty tactics to avoid the cognitive dissonnance.

The interesting point is ""brainwash"". Which leads to the question: ""Mama, please tell me what is wrong with me that you think I can be brainwashed!""

Fear is not defeated by reason. You need to put sufficient distance between you and your fear to be able to reason around it. Fear is defeated by emotions; when dealing with your mother, the best tool available to you if you want her to let go of her fears is maternal love.

Same thing with the gays taking over. Avoid rational discussion on who the gays are, why they should be taking over the US, and what for.

Unless you are (out or closeted) LGBTQ yourself, the right questions to start are ""Mama, are you afraid that I am gay? Are you afraid that I could be corrupted to become gay? Are you afraid that you are gay yourself?""

Use emotion to deal with the fear first, and find out exactly where it lies. Soothe it with emotion, put distance with it, and *THEN* you can start discussing it rationally.","1283302237"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","My suggestion is to not use Marijuana to battle social anxiety because you'll become dependent on it and want to use it in all social situations. In my own experience, I don't enjoy smoking and socializing, because I become awkward and paranoid as hell, and otherwise when I'm sober, I'm a very good socializer.

You wont be able to smoke weed before every party, every dinner, every date, every whatever, so why handicap yourself? You'll be much better off dealing with it without smoking pot. You don't have to smoke weed to bring out your personality and feel confident, all you have to do is learn the right cognitive skills and conquer your fears. 

I know you know its not going to be a magical cure-all quick fix, but still I want to warn you because most people who are well adjusted with their psychological disorders get better not because they're taking meds all the time (unless its extremely severe), its because they learn to deal with and conquer their disorders by changing the way they think.

Weed might help you discover the cognitive processes and tactics you'll need to help deal with your social anxiety, and if thats your aim, to use it as an aid/tool, then go for it with the intent of weaning yourself off of it. But otherwise, I'll return to my main point, you'll become dependent and find yourself panicking when you can't get high before whatever, or even if it wears off during the social encounter.

I've been where you are at the moment, don't be discouraged! Take my word for it, you're still very young, you have a lot of years ahead of you to learn how to deal with social anxiety, lots of experiences and lots of times to practice. You'll thank me later when you can handle social situations without wanting to be high, and you'll save lots of money and feel more confident, disciplined, and better about yourself in general.","1283302264"

&gt; Police and security officials in northern Afghanistan say they have been doing their best to arrest the men involved.

&gt; Islamic scholars recommended harsher punishment.

**MY CONCLUSION IS THAT THIS 2010 REHASHING IS INFLAMMATORY AND RATHER ANTI-ISLAMIC**.  IT MAKES NO MENTION WHATSOEVER OF THIS PRACTICE BEING DECRIED BY ISLAMIC CLERICS, NOR OF IT BEING CRACKED DOWN UPON BY AFGHAN POLICE.

[These](http://i.imgur.com/iakTch.jpg) [two](http://i.imgur.com/tctUZh.jpg) are excellent because they show off a couple of my fav parts of you. Your sexy back and incredibly hot ass. Terrific poses to showcase both. Twisty back poses do something for me. Those shoulder blades are like omnomnom. You're doing it perfectly. Slightly bent over pose has that ass looking exemplary. 

[These](http://i.imgur.com/KZxm2h.jpg) [two](http://i.imgur.com/qB89Th.jpg) are just some very classy, but still insanely hot, poses. Your body looks magnificent in these shots. Some of the most alluring I've ever seen of you. Legs/thighs/hips are outta sight scorching. Shoulders scrunched up is greatness. boobs and torso look fabulous in the laying down pose. Your mouth in that pose....

[Trying](http://i.imgur.com/Bkd0Kh.jpg) [hard](http://i.imgur.com/p6Li3h.jpg) to be good and restrain my adoration for you in these shots ;) It's difficult...so gd difficult. Whoaly shit! you are en Fuego in these pics. That ass. It looks perfect. Back of your thighs look sooo smooth and sexy. Puss is outstanding...damns. The one on the couch with that round ass poked out does pretty much everything for me. Side boob looks marvelous. Legs apart like that is perfect (rear shot of that would = mind blown). The arch in the back makes this pic 10x hot. Fav thing in this shot is upper thigh and the crease at the hip. Perfect place to give a buttload of attention to.

Overall I'd say....gat dayum!","1283302316"

Edit: Downtvoters: Not trying to be a file format zealot or anything, it's just that a bitmap image format does much better at two contrasting colors (in this case, the most contrasting - black and white) because JPEG compression doesn't do well with edges, which is really obvious in this picture at full zoom. Also, both PNG and GIF have an alpha channel (PNG's being much better because as it can be 8 bits) so this picture could actually be used as an arrow.","1283302327"
"electronics","t5_2qhue","Yes, that is exactly correct. Put a 2.4k resistor in series with the base lead to limit current, and you will be good to go. This will reverse your logic - a high into the base (Positive voltage) will turn the transistor on pulling the collector low. But this is the way to do it. 2N2222 is likely a good choice.

Edit: This link will explain both basic transistor theory, and how to use one as a switch (1/2 way down or so). 

http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/trancirc.htm

edit2: Don't bother about the math in selecting the base resistor. It is not critical, and 2.4k works well with 5 volt logic. (that really only comes into importance when you are designing low power - battery- devices).

edit 3: You should also see the advantage of using a low side driver in that the voltage it is controlling does not matter. The 5v (or 3v) logic only ""sees"" the base/emitter junction, which is near ground. The collector load can be powered by whatever you wish- yes, your pull-up is technically the ""load"".","1283302327"

I think this is just like other problems in that **admitting you have a problem is the first step**. Even if he doesn't think there is an issue, tell him that it's an issue **for you**, and therefore, it's an issue for **both of you**. When I was in a difficult relationship, I learned that you make a lot more progress on a problem if you separate the problem from either of you.

&gt;You see, I flirt with him often (sorry I can't help it), and he got pissed because I wouldn't stop talking about how much I like him being around me, will miss him physically, and how it will destroy me if he leaves. He told me to stop, and I didn't listen, he got mad and he was right to be so. He knows I might like him but he doesn't know I am crazy about him. 

Are you kidding? It's pretty obvious that you're crazy about him. However, it doesn't sound like he feels the same way, and you're being way too needy and clingy and creeping him out. Telling him you're in love with him is unnecessary, because he can already see that.

Look, if you could lose 70 pounds then you can keep doing it. Don't improve yourself for someone else - do it for yourself. If you can meet one great guy then you can meet others.

Clinging to someone and telling them that without them you're worthless just makes you seem worthless to them. Nobody wants to feel like they're the reason for your entire happiness.

how ever... sometimes this can provoke a LOT!

So... you say that they are 4 hours drive away?

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","The answer to that question is, do you want to be with the girl far away?  Do you like her enough to want to pursue a relationship with her or do you want to call it quits to try and pursue girls around your area?

The thing about relationships is that you need to find out what you want, find out what qualities do you want in a girl.  If you're afraid of hurting people, you're just going to end up with someone you never wanted and in the end both of you will be hurt, and it will be a lot worst.

My advice would be, for you to end the LDR, those never work out.  For you, a person who hasn't had much experience it's much worst.  I suggest you date and find out what qualities you want in a woman.

I see where you're coming from on this, and I agree with you. Though to me it seemed more like a ""this is what you're getting yourself into"" kind of thing and less of making excuses. It may have been in poor taste for the first-hang out, but I guess I'm glad I know right from the start instead of having it kept secret the whole time.

&gt; You have to ask yourself, how much are you going to take? What is your line? Make a commitment to yourself that when enough is enough for you that you say so and stay firm on it.

I really like this advice, and I will do my best to come up with a limit and stick to it no matter what. Thanks.

&gt; It sounds like Tim has a long way to go, and the people around him are feeding him excuses to behave how he wants rather than giving him tools to function as a healthy and happy person.

I'd say Tim does have a long way to go, but I'd imagine he's been getting better because his fathers have told me so a few times. As for feeding excuses, I don't think it's that way. His fathers are actually quite strict with him, and I've never seen them give into him when I'm around.

the father, while he was lied to, still ""did the deed"" so to speak and even if the mother is taking birth control, there is an element of risk, so by having sex with her, he agreed to that risk and fathered a child.

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","Yeah, the norms in America regarding hugging and touching in general are pretty fucked up.  Either due to molestation, or sexual harassment or there's this negative attitude about it.  I mean, the CDC did the Adverse Childhood Experiences study and there are some huge percentages on the number of men and women that were sexually abused so some of it is warranted (http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/ace/prevalence.htm)  However, there is a big difference between touching and molestation and touching doesn't just happen to lead to molesting someone you gotta have intent (yes even when you're touching yourself much like I and every other Redditor is now.)  

Touching is a basic part of human development.  I mean, the first act of socialization when we're born is being held by our parents, being touched by them.  Touching is hugely powerful, and by having this negative attitude towards hugging I think it adversely affects all of us socially.  Personally, I grew up in a very anti-touching home; and it very much affected my relationships with others throughout my life.  I kind of realized just how much of an affect it had when I got into college so I had to consciously realize some of my silly behavior towards others and change it.  It was excruciatingly frustrating at times, but I feel like I've grown to be a much more caring and social person because I taught myself how to touch and be affectionate, even just among friends and lady-friends, and hand-lady-friends.  

I'm not sure where this anti-touch attitude came from.  I'm guessing from Watson and the BTs in the 60s?  Regardless, our generation needs to realize that it is present, and try to change it any little way that we can.","1283302393"

An example of this was clearly presented in the video, how some comedians would use nigger plenty of times, and people would be okay with it, however if a white comedian were to use the same jokes in the same context, there would be a major outrage, and that person would be labeled racist. Is this clear?

---edit---

I would like to add, however, that this is not the only example. There is a common misconception about who is saying what, and who thinks who is in the wrong.

I am stating only that there are instances where people who are against racism clearly are racist themselves. Take the obama election for example. There were black priests and higher up black politicians who insisted that people against obama were merely against him for racist reasons. Those same people were the ones who called it ""their time"" and said it was no longer a ""white peoples country.""        
 I would like to say that this is the double standard here. Nigger is just one of the examples. It is a bad one at that, but it is an example. People are hypocrites by nature. I am a hypocrite by saying this because, well, I am a MASSIVE hypocrite. However That aside It creates the issue that racism is merely judged on opinion. I would like to ask you what your definition of racism is, and what qualifies as racism, and what doesn't.

I was on dialup for instance, I'd much rather download 300kb of text than 120 megs of images - the latter in fact hardly anyone would have bothered downloading, whereas people downloaded the former by the hundreds. I have a few hundred old ebooks sitting on one of my old harddrives somewhere, neatly categorized by author and series.

Also the text was much more versatile - this was partly what I was saying, people read the ""ebooks"" on their computers or on their crappy Windows CE PDA and Palm Pilots, before anyone had thought of making a kindle or a nook. I actually transferred a few to my TI89 programmable calculator to read at school, since it had a nice big screen.

This is still very popular now btw, a lot of people still read ebooks on their computers instead of readers, although there's now a lot of back and forth between devices thanks to formats like epub - I'll for instance read some ebooks mostly on an ebook reading mobile device, but continue reading off a crappy text file or HTML file on my computer at work. There are a bunch of sites and frequent torrented collections of ebooks in formats that have nothing to do with dedicated reader devices. I don't approve of reading from them when you have the option of buying the books (these are all commercial books I'm talking about), but if you do have a legal copy of the book the digital versions have been extremely convenient over the years for stuff like searching or reading on a computer.

You had to proofread after OCRing since OCRing isn't perfect - this step isn't necessary for the official ebooks since they have the digital source text to start with. The proofreading didn't always happen at once though, since people who downloaded and read the book would often mail back the distributor a list of corrections.

Your mother isn't in a community where who she really is will be fostered and cherished, so maybe you could try and bring the community, if you will, to her.

Maybe introduce her to some literature or see if there is a kind of group that reaches out to people in her position and can provide a little guidance.

I know you feel strongly for your ex, but you need to cut ties here.  She probably thinks she can change you.  For simply wanting that, you shouldn't want to be with her, I think.  She may not be, as a person, toxic for you, but if you're around her, you will be around things and people that are toxic for you.

A good example is how movie tickets cost less for students, the elderly, children, and matinee. Of course, it can also allow rich people to engage in conspicuous consumption by paying more for certain conveniences. The fancy restaurant example seems to have more at work than just the simple desire to keep poor people out.

George Washington:
(from his personal diary)

“O Most Glorious God, in Jesus Christ, my merciful and loving Father; I acknowledge and confess my guilt in the weak and imperfect performance of the duties of this day. I have called on Thee for pardon and forgiveness of my sins, but so coldly and carelessly that my prayers are become my sin, and they stand in need of pardon.”
“ I have sinned against heaven and before Thee in thought, word, and deed. I have contemned Thy majesty and holy laws. I have likewise sinned by omitting what I ought to have done and committing what I ought not. I have rebelled against the light, despising Thy mercies and judgment, and broken my vows and promise. I have neglected the better things. My iniquities are multiplied and my sins are very great. I confess them, O Lord, with shame and sorrow, detestation and loathing and desire to be vile in my own eyes as I have rendered myself vile in Thine. I humbly beseech Thee to be merciful to me in the free pardon of my sins for the sake of Thy dear Son and only Savior Jesus Christ who came to call not the righteous, but sinners to repentance. Thou gavest Thy Son to die for me.”
""Make me to know what is acceptable in Thy sight, and therein to delight, open the eyes of my understanding, and help me thoroughly to examine myself concerning my knowledge, faith, and repentance, increase my faith, and direct me to the true object, Jesus Christ the Way, the Truth, and the Life, ...""
[from a 24 page authentic handwritten manuscript book dated April 21-23, 1752]

Benjamin Franklin:

“ God governs in the affairs of man. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured in the Sacred Writings that except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. I firmly believe this. I also believe that, without His concurring aid, we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel” –Constitutional Convention of 1787 | original manuscript of this speech

James Madison:

“We have staked the whole future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. We’ve staked the future of all our political institutions upon our capacity…to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.” [1778 to the General Assembly of the State of Virginia]

John Adams:

“We recognize no Sovereign but God, and no King but Jesus!”
[April 18, 1775, on the eve of the Revolutionary War after a British major ordered John Adams, John Hancock, and those with them to disperse in “the name of George the Sovereign King of England."" ]

Your mother was wrong in thinking that Jefferson was a Christian.  It is almost a historical fact that he was a deist.  However, he did not regard his christian countrymen as ignorant or foolish for their beliefs.  He even recognized the value in their beliefs and respected them for it.

Jefferson:
“God who gave us life gave us liberty. And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are a gift from God? That they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, and that His justice cannot sleep forever.” [Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781]","1283302540"

In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honours, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. . .

"Music","t5_2qh1u","&gt; I think most people who like LPs the best are either full of shit or older and have a sentimental attachment to the imperfections on LPs and thus like the sound they produce better.

I take issue with this statement. I agree that because it is analog you are at the mercy of the vinyl's condition (warping, dust, mold, etc.), thus, you aren't receiving a ""perfect"" representation of the music. But my main beef is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war).

I'm a huge QOTSA fan, yet I can't stand most of their CD's because they sound like shit. I was also thoroughly disappointed with Them Crooked Vultures and CKY's new CD for the same reason. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/JInTB.png) a cut off of the Vultures CD. And [here's](http://i.imgur.com/T4EyJ.png) a Zeppelin song. All dynamic range has been raped in the final mix because of the industry's standard, that all engineers are expected to ""out-loud"" each other on your mp3 player.

I recently got into vinyl and I love all of the nuances of it. As someone mentioned before, the placing of the needle on the record and the first couple seconds of popping and hissing, I dig it. But mainly because I can listen to how the album was mixed and mastered the way it was intended (e.g., I have a lossless copy of *Houses of the Holy* burned to a CD and it sounds great).

But essentially I agree with what you're driving at, it's a ""to each his own"" situation. To OP, give it all a listen and decide for yourself.

EDIT: Wanted to add an excerpt from the wiki I linked:

""The maximum peak level  of analog recordings such as these is limited by the specifications of electronic equipment along the chain from source to listener, including vinyl record and cassette players. With the advent of CDs, music was encoded to a digital format with a clearly defined maximum peak level. ""","1283302556"

Much less with ludicrous link text like this?  The first impression it leaves is not ""there's a squared-away company with innovative ideas"", it's ""oh god here they come, look busy so they won't talk to us.""  Were I someone looking to actually provide serious capital to you, I would consider this shooting yourself in the foot with a cannon.

And if you've given up on typical capital raising and have hitched your wagon to this micro-investing scheme, you're badly missing the mark there as well.  You're not asking me to invest $10, you're asking me to *donate* $10.  I get nothing back. I have a higher standard for the kind of organization I'm going to just give $10 to vs. one with whom I'm exchanging $10 for investment purposes, just like there's another, lower, standard for companies I'll give $10 in order to purchase their product.  You're not meeting any higher standards, let me tell you.

I am honestly completely baffled as to how anyone thought any part of this was a good idea.  Sure,  a ""wacky"" link text will get more people to click, but you people have to know those aren't going to be convertible clicks.  My recommendation would be that next time, you should link to your ""real website"" with link text that accurately describes your work/innovations.

I'm from Canberra, studying in Sydney at the moment and I am actually also half asian, but have never experienced any discrimination in my life. I am saddened by your story and didn't realise racism could be so extreme in a major city like Melbourne. There are definitely racists in Australia as I said before, but in Canberra you rarely hear a story about racial bashings. The atmosphere feels different here I suppose, all races feel as if they can go out into the city and be safe. I guess the racists mostly keep it to themselves, or voice their opinions only amongst themselves. I remember one guy at my high school was quite racist and whenever he said anything derogatory many people would be shocked and would denounce him.


I agree that the treatment of Aborigines in particular is very bad, and I think most people are afraid of them because the stereotype of their race is one that thieves and drinks, which is untrue.


Anyway I guess my experience of racism in Australia is dramatically different to yours and we have quite different perspectives.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","I don't call anyone who disagrees with me a Jewish supremacist, who hates all Goyim unless their remarks indicate that this is so. There are numerous pro-Israeli redditors who fall into this category.

It's beyond funny, but not surprise, that you would pick the few times I announced certain pro-Israeli redditors as Jewish supremacists to make it seem that I describe everyone this way. But then, this is a standard debating tactic used by many pro-Israelis. Being a Jewish supremacist is a sad fact, not a blood libel, grow up.

I asked you if you condemn the statement. You give me a minor rant about your religious leaders. I'm not worried about you or your religious leaders.

However, I take these religious leaders at their word, being Talmudic and Torah scholars, they would know. Their statement clearly holds some water with many Jews, otherwise why would a book need to be published?

This isn't about my moral system, it's about a religious moral system that views all Goyim (the majority of the worlds population) as somehow inferior. Perhaps I should go into detail about how some revered Jewish leaders find Jews to be morally as well as genetically superior to all Goys.

Perhaps I should go into Rabbinical math the counts Jewish life being on a ratio to proportion of at minimal 1:10 I've also heard 1:100, 1:1000 (10, 100 or a 1000 Goys for the life of one Jew) Are you aware of this ratio? If so, do you find it racist?

My point about Hamas is that its an Israeli creation, as one, they seriously need to look into their own motives for creating it, as well as any actions by Hamas. 

This might be a novel concept to you, but you can't have it both ways and hope to remain legitimate in the eyes of the world. Hamas has always clearly stated their intention, why you'd be the least bit surprised about it is the mystery.

But, If you seriously believe my point to be irrelevant, then by all means it's irrelevant. However, you loose moral ground by your inability to understand what the outcome of creating an Islamic fundamentalist group would be. 

No that you're emotionally capable of seeing this any differently, but, I don't portray Israel as pure evil. Would you like me to refer you to several recent comments praising Israeli and Jewish contributions to society at large?

Funny how your radar is set for only negative comments, but that's to be expected.

I would say no Israeli spokesperson would be honest enough to praise in public what many in private congratulate the IDF for. The indiscriminate killing of Palestinians. Frankly, I'm surprised you'd even stoop as low as this in the hope of scoring some points.

No one from Israel or their proxies in America has to publicly announce their unbridled joy over the extirpation of the Palestinians. All anyone seeking the truth regarding Israels true feelings has to do is read comments from Israeli religious leaders, so-called intellectuals, historians, military personnel and Israelis in the street.

I don't say there aren't people who disagree with this racist position, however, there's more than enough who do. 

As to my ""grinding this as a recurrent propaganda point."" I've known about this for over a year, please refer me to where I've mentioned it more than three other times, and always in proper context.

Besides, it's not a propaganda point, it's the objective truth.

You're sure Ill grind this out because you want to view me through a narrow predictable lens that you're certain all critics of Israel fall into. How sad for you!

In closing, I'm not sure if you're a Jew, an Israeli, A Christian Zionist, a philo-Semite or none of these, however, you consciously present yourself as a Jew. Please stop the childish games. I really don't give a fuck who you are.

How dare you call me a hypocrite. At least I'm upfront about my position. 

On the other hand, you've gone for every false emotional point you can make, because it's all you have.

I'm an American. I care about my country constantly being made to be Israels lawyer, interference runner and bitch. As an American I'm painfully aware that there are numerous politicians, polemicists, wing-nut welfare recipients, and Israeli-Firsters who constantly put the interests of Israel above and before those of America. Perhaps you're one of these despicable, traitorous bastards. If so, you should rot.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I'm by no means an expert on the app store, and after hearing countless stories of whiny users bitching that a developer ""ripped them off"" with a $.99 app, well, I'm glad for that.  But...

From what I'm told this is *not* true of the app store.  At all.  There are a few developers who have spun their success into future successes (although usually after dropping development and becoming publishers) but the big success stories still seem to be first time or small time devs with no prior success and a lot of luck.

And that makes sense, if a decent app can only do maybe 1k to 2k downloads on a platform with 81 million users, how in the hell would you call that momentum?  That's what you're talking about, really.  Building on prior success, building and capitalizing on momentum.  None of that seems to exist in a market where your product is ""too pricey"" if it costs over a dollar.  You never even have a *chance* to build any momentum.

Whether it is their first game or not doesn't seem relevant.  If it's a good product, and is well received, it should have seen *some* degree of success.  Instead it was ""priced too high"" and then ""priced too low"".  No price really seemed to make any difference at all.

I do know their next game (which wasn't nearly at the quality level of mentalBlock) was in the top 10 games for weeks.  50,000 downloads in that time.

That's more or less what it does now since I haven't actually added anything to let you remove a method. :)

&gt; Seriously, what good reason would a developer have to remove a method from a class?

That's a good question. I can see it being useful for, maybe:

* Security, to remove capabilities from an object before passing it to something less secure
* Thread-safety, to remove mutating methods from an object to make it immutable before sharing it across threads

&gt; Are there any other languages that let you do this?

*&lt;shrug&gt;* Don't know. What happens if you assign None to an existing method in Python?

Removing a method is kind of a blunt hammer example, though. There are other more subtle cases where you could break an object after type-checking. The biggest example would be adding a method to an interface. Doing so would have the side-effect of having every class that used to implement that interface now no longer do so unless they also get a method added to match the one added to the interface.","1283302673"

The fact that, if it can't be falsified in principle, it isn't science. Everything in science is subject to test and rejection based on new evidence.

This isn't actually a science fact, more like a meta-fact, but with your background, it's the single most important thing to learn about science -- there is only evidence, nothing else matters. Opinions don't matter. Authorities don't matter. Fashion doesn't matter.

Even scientific reputation doesn't matter. The largest amount of scientific eminence is trumped by the smallest amount of scientific evidence.

I used to know exactly what I was going to do during the next match up, completely disregarding what the opponent could be doing.  Now, since I am playing random, the strategy is thrown completely out the window and I am forced to scout, refine my strategy, and play on my feet.

In WoW, the quests pretty much finish themselves, everything is on your map, all special items sparkle on the ground, one quest takes you to the next easily. Most people can be half asleep and still manage to finish quests, but FFXIV requires you to read and think about what you are doing (aside from guildleves of course). That is what I mean when I say it doesn't hold your hand.

If you are used to WoW, the way FFXIV dumps you in to the game can be a big shock, it's very different, if you don't read and pay attention to what NPC's say to you, it is easy to get lost.","1283302717"

There is nothing special about a person who believes in a god. They can not do anything more than a non believer who is equally capable.

The accepted definition of the (round) ""unit n-sphere"" these days is the set of points in Euclidean (n+1)-dimensional space having distance one from the origin (or some fixed point) with respect to the Euclidean norm (the usual way of defining distance). I am (kind of) a geometer and know many more geometers and topologists and no one I know uses Coxeter's convention. 

The reason, by the way, that ""referring to the number of coordinates in the underlying space "" is a stupid idea is that if I can ""nicely"" embed an n-dimensional sphere in (n+1)-space, then I've automatically ""nicely"" embedded *every* other k-sphere with 0 &lt;= k &lt;=n in that space as well (they are the equators). The number of coordinates in the ambient space doesn't matter, only the least number of parameters necessary to describe the space ""locally"" (for suitably nice spaces).

""
These settings can have a significant impact on frame rate, especially for people that have slow frame rates on the title screen.  Available modes are 2D, 2DSW, 2DASYNC, STANDARD, PARTIAL:&lt;number&gt;, ACCUM_BUFFER, FRAME_BUFFER and VBO. The number after PARTIAL refers to how many frames it will redo a printed tile before skipping it, so you might try increasing it a bit if you have flickering when PARTIAL is set.  Please note that any of these combinations might cause frame rates to drop significantly or cause unpleasant side effects like flickering.

By and large, 2D should be the most reliable, while STANDARD has a good combination of speed and reliability. However, all 2D modes are normally far slower than even STANDARD, which may be the slowest OpenGL mode.

2DASYNC may be slightly more responsive than 2D on a multi-core machine, but this has recently become doubtful due to improvements to the other modes.

Linux/OS X users may also use PRINT_MODE:TEXT for primitive ncurses output.

[PRINT_MODE:2D]
	Mode examples:
	 PRINT_MODE:2D
	 PRINT_MODE:TEXT
	 PRINT_MODE:FRAME_BUFFER
	 PRINT_MODE:PARTIAL:0
[SINGLE_BUFFER:NO]""

The newb pack used standard, which caused it to crash upon loading graphics, setting it to any of the 2d modes stopped all the problems.

With this definition, which is THE definition, then something in the presence of an omnipotent being can not be not done since unlimited power means something that has no limits, inluding, but not limited to, moving rocks and filling space. 

Also, according to your own premise, the fact that the rock isn't movable has nothing to do with the abilities of the omnipotent being, but with the constraints within which the omnipotent being is placed (ie. a finite universe). So already you have placed limits on this omnipotent being, which cancels out the claim that the bei is omnipotent, since an omnipotent being can not have limits.","1283302816"

Drugs should be legal, as long as the user doesn't harm someone else with them, just like alcohol. 

I meant to put all drugs, because it's ultimately up to the user. Just as long as it's not hurting anyone else, but that would fall under other laws anyways. 

Everything would be more of a state issue. Federal would only create the basic pillar laws (as stated above) just things that are obvious. They also would only deal with outside threats.  State would cover the rest.

This is my main concern with this study (of 22 people) gaining too much speed. There should be more focus on getting people up and moving around the office, rather than trying to create the most ideal positioning. Granted this opinion is highly idealistic due to the emphasis on efficiency that every corporation appears to value. 

We are all getting weaker due to our lifestyle and it's a sad story when sitting upright is considered ""unhealthy"" because it causes strain. Increasing the angles of daily positioning is only going to act as a catalyst to turning us into those people buzzing around in Wall-E.

It's that women who could potentially be interested are not **because** they have very negative conceptions about the nature of the field that prevent them from pursuing it.  For example, women are made to believe that engineering is hard and women are not as good at science and math so they can't be as successful.  Or they think that engineers are on the whole pretty awkward and antisocial.  Or they believe that they won't be respected as a woman engineer, because the field is more or less a boys' club where women are marginalized and disrespected, and their talents underestimated.

HenryAlan merely asserted a straw man. Of course, Stanley Fish would never recommend that conclusion; none of us would. We'd look and notice that the ""Ground Zero Mosque"" has a worldview so different from the extremists that attacked us, that those extremists hate it as much as they hate us. 

In other words: the argument is to treat these as separate cases because __they are__ separate cases, not because things can never be related. Certainly if extremists owned the property, the discussion would be different. Stupid straw man argument. ","1283302892"

At the same time you are correct. I don't have any knowledge of what I want in a woman. I have very strong feelings for the first girl.

With respect to Islam, we see terror attacks at the hands of Islamic extremists wherever Islam is present.  Russia, the US, Europe, Africa, India, the Middle East.  Why, when there is so much evidence to the contrary, is the Left so appeasing in its appraisal of Islam, to the notion that it is a religion of Peace?  Can you imagine what the Left would say of US Christians if they believed or practiced what even moderate Muslims do around the globe?  There is something at work here, besides a measured assessment of diversity.

I saw it in the Russian sub section of the history section at Boarders in 2007.  I usually don't get books unless I know about them and have read a few reviews (especially when it comes to non-fiction because it can be so dry), but this looked so good.  I got it and totally wasn't disappointed.  
It's written by a scientific historian who made many trips to the Soviet Union between 1960 and the present day (it was published in 2006) and every chapter is basically a vignette about one or another of his trips.  Some of them were laugh out loud funny, some of them were tragically sad.  The prose isn't the most gorgeous prose ever, but it's well written and easy to read.  
Highly recommended for people who are interested in Russia (my husband is Russian and we were both in tears laughing over some of the stories, and he said the depiction of the Soviet Union was pretty accurate), or for people who are interested in history in general.

I still contend the penalty is not being added. If you were consuming cannabis in any manner (not just smoking) with a minor present prior to prop 19 you would be committing a crime. If you smoke cannabis with a minor present after prop 19 there is simply no exemption being created by section 11300. It's difficult for me to interpret that as adding a penalty, especially considering that no less than 3 methods of consumption will be legalized under that scenario with prop 19.

Also, the proposition states it will not be permitted, but does not actually create penalties. Wouldn't it be left up to individual city/counties to create laws to actually penalize that scenario?

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;we must take it that FIFTY SEVEN more of these projects must be built and operate at peak efficiency to only meet the requirements of the US's demand for non-fuel related oil, at a cost of approximately $5 billion each-- or $283 billion for the whole shabang, roughly six times the pre-tax income of the world's largest oil producer, Exxon Mobile, in 2009.

To that, I respond: economies of scale.

Synthetic fuel is not a core component of the economy and therefore has not been developed to the point of reducing marginal costs. With cheap enough input energy and large scale usage of such technology, the price will come way down.

&gt;the creation of synthetic fuels still requires fossil fuels  in some form or another, so while it may lower our direct dependence on naturally occurring crude, it simply makes us more dependent on other fossil fuels

First, this buys us time for peak oil. And it opens up many fossil fuels that we currently can't use (e.g. massive amounts of oil shale). Second, we can move to other feedstocks eventually such as biomass, CO2 dissolved in water, or (hopefully) atmospheric CO2. Third, I advocate other things that will drastically reduce the amount of petrofuels we will need to make this more feasible.

&gt;At the end of the day, I believe our disagreement stems largely by my mistaken omission of a single word from my original post-- ""currently."" 

Sure. I'm just talking about 20 years down the road when our policy decisions now will start to take effect. 

&gt;But one cannot get so lost in the fog of excited optimism that one cannot maintain a realistic and level-headed understanding of what one can expect to accomplish in the foreseeable future.

I don't think thorium MSRs constitute extreme optimism. The prototypes were built for relatively low costs and low resources 40 years ago. Extreme optimism would be saying fusion or solar power can replace all fossil fuels immediately. 

If you've followed my posts on Reddit before (I post a lot on this subreddit and on /r/energy), you'd know that I have a very comprehensive plan for transitioning to nuclear power to deal with peak oil and global warming. 

In the immediate future, I advocate the following...

From the fossil fuels side...

* upgrade coal plants to use coal gasification
* build lots of combined cycle natural gas plants
* expand shale gas production
* expand underground coal gasification
* expand onshore and offshore oil drilling (as a hedge, although I hate the environmental risks involved)
* begin large scale synthetic fuel R&amp;D using coal, methane, and biomass as the initial feedstocks (although have some exploratory R&amp;D in closed cycles using seawater or captured CO2).
* fund R&amp;D for carbon capture and sequestration (i'm skeptical about this being used on a large scale, but I think the potential carbon negative benefits of biofuel CCS is worth doing the R&amp;D here).

On the nuclear side we should:

* Deploy the Gen III reactors that are already planned (AP1000 and EPR). Unfortunately, due to the costs, I'm not too excited about these. However, if the US started building lots of these, the costs could come down a lot as more industrial infrastructure is built (especially competittion for Japan Steel Works in large pressure vessel manufacturing).
* Deploy small mass produced reactors like B&amp;W's mPower, NuScale, and Hyperion. These technologies are well-proven and can be scaled up quickly without needing Japan Steel Works in the loop.
* Restart R&amp;D on the MSR and the IFR with the goal of having both systems ready for mass production in the 10-15 year range
* Restart large scale reprocessing
* Develop deep borehole storage for the leftovers from reprocessing
* Do R&amp;D for nuclear transmutation technology using particle accelerators or hybrid fission-fusion (e.g. LLNL's LIFE project)
* Fund more exploratory fusion projects like ITER, Polywell, Z-pinch, etc. I won't bet the farm on these, but I'm all for advancing them to see what happens. Even if we give them tens of billions per year, that is still very cheap compared to oil wars, global warming weather disasters, and economic collapse from peak oil.

For transportation, we basically need to deploy plug-in serial hybrids like the Volt and start building more electric trains/trams/PRTs. In the next decade or so, I expect batteries to get a lot denser and cheaper as technologies like Stanford's silicon nanowire Li-Ion reach the market. Once again, economies of scale matter here. Also, increased usage of telecommuting as the economies continue to transition to post-industrial will help reduce the growth rates of oil usage (I only go to work for meetings these days and do all my programming from home).

The core part of my plan is this: natural gas and small LWRs for the next decade and then LFTRs after that and fusion in the very long run.

&gt;I couldn't agree with you more. In fact, it's funny that you mention the PRT system, as it's a system with which I'm well acquainted. I'm an alumnus of WVU and currently reside in Morgantown, WV. The system has plenty of problems, but it's one which I think could be used to great effect in a number of areas and geographic locations.

Awesome. I haven't rode on that before (although I have an in-law there now). Also, that thing was built in the 70s, so doing it with modern computers could make it much more awesome. I'm also excited about the prospect of having AI algorithms drive cars to basically result in the same thing (and massively reduce traffic congestion by coordinating cars, which should reduce fuel wasted by traffic jams). This technology has been rapidly advancing lately (e.g. the DARPA Grand Challenge and the Urban Challenge).

As you can tell, I'm a techno-optimist, but I believe that I am justified in this. Of course, I'm just optimistic about what we could do with our scientific knowledge and natural resources. Unfortunately, the political environment sucks horribly and who knows what will actually happen.

The drunk guy turns at him and says : ""You know, they have a special beer here, it's a magical beer""

The sober man, who doesn't want any trouble, asks the drunk man to leave him alone, being very polite. But the man continues :

""No, dude, I tell, you, they got a magical beer, if you drink it, you can FLYYYYY""

The sober guy loses patience and gets angry : ""You're completely drunk, no one believes your shit !""

The drunk guy responds : ""Oh yeah, I'm drunk ? We'll see about that !"" and asks the barman for a magic beer. He drinks it in one go, and jumps out of the roof.

When he jumps, the guy actually flies around the building, up and down again, and slowly lands on the ground, he takes the elevator and walks back to the guy : ""see, I told you !""

Amazed, the sober guy orders a magic beer right away, drinks it, and jumps, failing to fly, and dies as he crashes to the floor.

The barman then slowly cleans the beer glass, and turns at the drunk guy :

A quote from the article: ""From the scientific standpoint, it is difficult to find a precedent in medicine for what is beginning to happen in psychiatry. The intellectual basis of this field is shifting from one discipline, based on subjective 'mental' phenomena, to another, neuroscience. Indeed, today’s developing science-based understanding of mental illness very likely will revolutionize prevention and treatment and bring real and lasting relief to millions of people worldwide.""

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","There are a number of reasons why sports programs are not and should not be cut.

* Most importantly, research suggests that students who participate in ""organized athletic activities"" have higher GPAs than students who do not (1)(6) and they are more likely to graduate (6)\*
* Participation in school athletics has been shown to increase self-concept, locus of control, and educational aspirations (2); furthermore, increased self-concept or identity has been shown to decrease delinquency and drug abuse (3)
* Participation in school athletics has been shown to decrease delinquency, tardiness, and absenteeism (2)
* Girls who participate in high school athletics have statistically significantly higher ACT scores, higher post-secondary educational aspirations, and better time management skills (4)
* Disadvantaged (especially minority) students who participate in athletics have higher mobility orientations (aspirations) (5)

However, it should also be noted that there is research suggesting that participation in music programs has better results in terms of increasing GPA (7), but none say anything about reducing delinquency (at least no research that I could find supported or denied the claim that music affects delinquency).

Now, all of this being said, I do not believe that athletics should come at the cost of education. The academic benefits of athletic programs does not come close to the academic benefits of *having teachers in the classroom*. I do believe, however, scholastic athletics are a valuable *extension* of academics, and are a tool to be used to improve the quality of academics in a school system (by encouraging students to be disciplined, goal oriented, etc.).

\* It should be noted that the research suggested that while students' average GPAs were higher, students who participated in athletics saw smaller overall gains in GPA during the course of their education.

"electronics","t5_2qhue","YOur problem was you were using an NPN transistor on the high side. To saturate the transistor the base needs to be about .7v above the voltage at the emitter. The proper way to use an NPN (and the most efficient way to do it period) is to use the transistor on the low side. The emitter tied to ground, when the base rises to about .7v, the transistor will saturate (pass maximum current). This will cause the collector to be at ground potential. Remember also, transistors are current operated devices. Current has to flow into the base-emitter junction (after achieving the .7v breakdown voltage). That will cause a higher current to flow through the emitter-collector junction. Here is a page that will explain this a bit better...

The issue at hand here is pretty simple. Superman has no defenses against magic or psionics. Assuming the mind trick won't work because Superman has super-will, the only thing that Force users can count on is magic. **IF** the Force's manifestations are considered magical, then Superman is fucked. Basically, if Force Lightning is not actual electricity arcing through the air but some magical form of something similar to lightning then it will harm Superman.

You may believe and state that G Kleck's study was flawed, but that does not make it true. Which study are you referring to that supposedly proves that Kleck's studies are false? Citations please.

The non-gun homicide rate of children in the U.S. is more than twice as high as in other western countries.  And eight times as many children die from non-gun violent acts than from gun crimes. This indicates that the problem is violence, not guns.  [REF: Kids and Guns ,Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , 2000]

Fatal gun accidents for children ages 0-14 declined by almost 83% from 1981 to 2002 – all while the number of handguns per capita increased over 41%. [REF: National Center for Health Statistics and BATF estimates on handguns in circulation, BATF, Firearms Commerce in the United States 2001/2002]

If defensive gun use is common then many criminals should certainly have encountered armed resistance. Professors James D. Wright and Peter Rossi surveyed 2,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons across the United States. Wright and Rossi reported that 34% of the felons said they personally had been ""scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim""; 69% said that they knew at least one other criminal who had also; 34% said that when thinking about committing a crime they either ""often"" or ""regularly"" worried that they ""[m]ight get shot at by the victim""; and 57% agreed with the statement, ""Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police."" (James D. Wright &amp; Peter H. Rossi, Armed and Considered Dangerous: A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms [1986]. See Guns and Public Health: Epidemic of Violence or Pandemic of Propaganda? by Don B. Kates, et. al. Originally published as 61 Tenn. L. Rev. 513-596 [1994]) [REF: http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgeff.html]

EDIT: And if you truly were concerned for the kids, you'd probably want to start by banning pools and buckets of water.

Now to directly speak about you, I think you talk out of both sides of your mouth.  You claim you have no information to judge and that you are not ready to judge, yet you do just that.  You judge her by claiming a likelihood that her behavior justified getting beat down.  Out of thin air you make a snap judgment.

Presented with her side of the story, you discount and dismiss it outright.  Yet you're not ready to judge.  Your not ready to judge but you won't take 5 seconds to google the issue to make a better informed comment.  Your not ready to judge but you can't be bothered with reading the provided link in THE VERY SAME ARTICLE that you originally claimed doesn't have enough information.

You're not ready to judge but anyone highlighting via sarcasm or irony, the obvious (and I use the term as it's [defined](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prejudiced)) prejudice you have, even perhaps irrespective of race; makes you drum up conspiracies to keep the blacks down.  Somehow it is I who is deluded because you are so ready to jump to conclusions and explain away police brutality.
You behaved stereotypically and got a stereotypical response.

Perhaps if you are too sensitive when someone criticizes what you say  in regards to a black woman getting beat down by the cops and get offended by the subsequent 'natural conclusion' that is bound to be made (funny how only you get to make such conclusions),  maybe you shouldn't post outside your race.  Or at least show empathy first distrust second.

I mean racist is just a word.  And I didn't even say it!

Oh.  Since you asked I went through the trouble of finding your karma whoring [tendencies](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d0i43/ever_wanted_to_express_a_politically_incorrect/c0wmqzo).  When you talk a lot, you tend to forget what you say.  I do the same.

He asked me to move, I said no. He started freaking out at me. When he finally stopped running his mouth, I told him that if he really wanted me to move, he could call the cops.

I locked my doors, cranked the radio, killed maybe a good hour laughing quietly to myself. He finally DID call the cops, was cited, and I was one my way.

# 

Should you care to venture on this most dangerous and entertaining endeavor of vigilante justice here are some things to consider:

- Do this in a shitty car. (For obvious reasons.)

Also, the guy I blocked in was easily twice my size in both personal, and vehicular weight. To mitigate the serious possibly of an ass kicking, I put my concealed carry permit on the dash where it could be seen. This doesn't qualify as a threat or brandishing a weapon, but it at least conveyed the message that it wouldn't be too bright for them to start smashing windows.

- Bring a video camera, and record EVERYTHING from the very moment you block the person.

- Alert the police yourself. That way you at least look like you're trying to do a ""good deed"", not looking for a fight

- Look at which car you're boxing in. Parked-Over-The-Line Escalades are a BAD idea. Sure it's the person who probably needs to be put in his/her place. But you must consider the type of person who drives such a vehicle, and parks it in such a manner. Usually explosive, black guys who carry an unlicensed weapon. (It's not racism if it fact.)

- Know when it's no longer worth it making a point, and get the hell out of there.

- If there are no cameras/cops/security, smash the guy's window out. I'm deadly serious. Smash out a window. Slash a tire. Key the car. It saves you time, a possible confrontation, and you still get message across without endangering yourself.

Seriously. Go for it. Everyone is on your side. Every time I've been caught doing this by a passer by, they've either clapped, cheered, or secretly wished to themselves that they were the one's doing it. And every time I've been caught by security/police, it's been a slap on the wrist, or a citiation which was easily less than the price of a new SUV front windshield.

Downvote me all you want, but it is simple psychological fact that **REAL consequences beget behavioral change.** Until something real, happens to them, they're just going to keep on doing it.

To the rest of you douchebag parkers, me and my 89 Honda Civic hit the mall every Saturday. I have plenty of time, little to lose, and I REALLY fucking hate people with poor regard for others.

**tl;dr: Be careful doing this, but if you're going to, go all out. It's the only way your going to plant the idea that perhaps what they are doing is not a good thing.**","1283303162"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","One of my favorite quotes that addresses this issue is [Galt's speech](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/altruism.html) in ""For the New Intellectual"".

&gt;Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others, but not your own? If enjoyment is a value, why is it moral when experienced by others, but immoral when experienced by you? If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others? Why is it immoral for you to desire, but moral for others to do so? Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it, but moral to give it away? And if it is not moral for you to keep a value, why is it moral for others to accept it? If you are selfless and virtuous when you give it, are they not selfish and vicious when they take it? Does virtue consist of serving vice? Is the moral purpose of those who are good, self-immolation for the sake of those who are evil?
&gt;
&gt;The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil, provided they did not earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for them to accept it, provided they are unable to produce it, unable to deserve it, unable to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to enjoy it, provided they do not obtain it by right.
&gt;
&gt;Such is the secret core of your creed, the other half of your double standard: it is immoral to live by your own effort, but moral to live by the effort of others—it is immoral to consume your own product, but moral to consume the products of others—it is immoral to earn, but moral to mooch—it is the parasites who are the moral justification for the existence of the producers, but the existence of the parasites is an end in itself—it is evil to profit by achievement, but good to profit by sacrifice—it is evil to create your own happiness, but good to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others.
&gt;
&gt;Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by opposite rules: those who may desire anything and those who may desire nothing, the chosen and the damned, the riders and the carriers, the eaters and the eaten. What standard determines your caste? What passkey admits you to the moral elite? The passkey is lack of value.
&gt;
&gt;Whatever the value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon those who don’t lack it. It is your need that gives you a claim to rewards. If you are able to satisfy your need, your ability annuls your right to satisfy it. But a need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives of mankind.

At 19, you should know by now you can't fix other people.  It is hard to even fix ourselves.

So I made assumptions that you would be sexually active based on a lack of info in your post that would suggest the contrary.  

I think you have made a few bad assumptions too.  I have three committed relationships.  I have friends with whom I sleep.  My marriage didn't work out, but I rent a room at her house and we parent together.  It is not my primary mode of relationship to love em and leave em like you think.

"prop19","t5_2rvul","Maybe stoners for Prop19 are so focused on how it would be good for them personally, they're willing to ignore how post-Prop19 CA &amp; America could go *really* bad, really quick.

If Prop19 goes bad, could it be the last step (at least for many years)? I suppose Prop 215 was trailblazing, but cannabis really does have valid medical uses. Medicine is easier for some people to accept than 420 culture.

Healthcare reform didn't happen overnight. But some people see Obamacare as ceding power to corporations. They may also see Prop19 as, again, ceding power to corporations. Most Rastafaris don't vote, but wouldn't they see Prop19 as giving their sacrament over to Babylon?

The end of segregation didn't happen overnight. But the fall of the Berlin Wall did. It was an accident, a bureaucratic mistake, an unintentional result. East German Politburo spokesperson Günter Schabowski read a note saying East Berliners would be allowed to cross the border with proper permission. Later his answers led journalists to conclude that the Wall was open for everyone. By 7PM the wires were reporting that the Berlin Wall was open. At 8PM a West German TV channel, ARD, broadcast incomplete info from the press conference. At 10:42PM their moderator Hanns Friedrichs mistakenly reported that East Germany had announced that immediately its borders were open to everyone. Crowds swelled. Guards were outnumbered by thousands of people. After a couple of hours the crowd chanted ""Open the gate, open the gate!"" Crossings were opened, people flooded into the West, footage was shown in the East, sending more Easterners onto the streets. Soon it was too late. The opening of the Berlin Wall was largely unintentional. It was due to the ""to the mumbling of a sleep-deprived East German official, some overzealous Western reporting and the willingness of East Germans to risk a trip to the wall""[-Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846_pf.html)","1283303222"

Here's the thing. The double standard you speak of does not exist. Was George Carlin not an entertainer? Was Bill Hicks? I've heard routines where they both used the word. Is Tarantino not a man who's business it is to entertain? I've heard him use the word and actors under his direction numerous times. Godfather is one of my favourite books and movies and there are no black characters at all...yet in both the book and movie, during the council of the heads of all the families they decide the drug business should be left to ""the niggers"". Was Mario Puzo not in the entertainment business via his literature?

You're doing what this video mistakenly did...conflating entertainment with real life and then ignoring examples of entertainment that contradicts the bullshit claims the video makes. The argument seems to be ""why can this black entertainer say this word on stage while I can't say it on the street"". If it was true that white entertainers couldn't use the word in context and the argument was ""Why can black entertainers say this word on records, films and on stage while white entertainers can't do the same"" then I'd agree, but the reality is white entertainer do and it's ignored and then swiftly forgotten when arguments like this come up.","1283303285"

I do really like your take on the ending. But I think even taking what you said, they could still be viewed as the same ending, but under different levels of perception and analysis. Where you say that the series ending has Shinji choosing to take control of his life, find his own meaning, and be happy, and the movie ending has him choosing the reject instrumentality and remain an individual, not melting into everyone else and avoiding apocalypse, I think the show and movies taken together would say that those are, in fact, the same thing. So the distinction between the artistic, existential ending and the visceral, science fiction ending would only be in the presentation, and they both provide different reference frames for analyzing the themes of the show.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm guessing you haven't paid attention to what has happened in several Republican primary's?  How about this recent tidbit: **[Tea partiers rebuke Bachmann visit](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40345.html)**  
  
  
&gt;Bachmann, a national conservative leader who announced a formation of a Tea Party Caucus in the House of Representatives last week, is trekking to St. Louis on Saturday to stump for Rep. Roy Blunt’s Senate campaign. A swath of tea party groups in the state aren't pleased.

&gt;“Tea Party participants believe the spending in Washington has to STOP. Roy Blunt voted for TARP and Cash for Clunkers,” Jedediah Smith, a tea party leader in Missouri’s Franklin County, said in a biting statement Wednesday. “For Michele Bachmann to come to Missouri and give the impression that all the Missouri Tea Parties support Roy Blunt is an abomination of everything we have been standing up for. Most Tea Party supporters I know will be baffled by Michele Bachmann helping someone with a record like Roy Blunt before the primary vote.”   
  
  
Oh, and did you happen to notice that in that very same NYTs survey only 18% said that they **always** vote Republican. That means that about 82% have sometimes voted for a non-Republican.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Except that if you actually understand what is being said by that, then you would realize that your simple replace of 'sin' with 'belief' doesn't result in an analogous statement.  

The problem stems from the very common perception of what Judaism and Christianity actually mean by 'sin'.  In common parlance 'sin' has come to be synonymous with 'evil' even though this isn't remotely what is intended by its use in scripture.  The best translation for the Hebrew word that has been generally translated into the word 'sin' would actually be, ""To miss the mark""; with the understood context that when 'sin' is spoken of, all that is being discussed is the fact that humans are not perfect and so are incapable of always achieving 'the mark'.  A concrete example of this would be an archer aiming for a bulls-eye hitting in the ring outside the bulls-eye. In missing his/her mark/aim/target, the archer has 'sinned'.

Admittedly, most people who call themselves christian are not aware of this distinction and think of 'sin' as shorthand for 'evil', and so with them your response if fine.  However, in context of what their scriptures are actually saying, your response, ""... love the believer.."" carries a significantly different message than the one you are attempting to respond to.","1283303312"

You may be compressing your [ulnar nerve](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Nerves_of_the_left_upper_extremity.gif), or significantly restricting blood flow to it, quite possibly damaging it.  Another possibility is [thoracic outlet syndrome](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/DS00800), which is a compression of your [brachial artery](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Gray525.png) as it passes through an outlet in your shoulder.

If you rule that out and you are merely compressing your wrist, then focus on bike posture and a slightly relaxed frame geometry. Yes, you'll have to give up aerodynamic drops and other such positions that stress your wrist.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I read a story related to this in Leo Tolstoy's  short story, ""Family Happiness.""  The main male lead is reluctant to marry the girl of his dreams because, being older, he knows she will change and become restless because of her youth.  They eventually marry about halfway through.  I won't spoil the ending but the message was that people change, including yourself, over time and if you are not willing to accept or plan for these changes, then your life will be a disaster.  

Western women have it drilled into their minds that they need to find everlasting love in their soulmate and that every guy in between are casualties that earn them things.  Some of them, even those in their 50s, never learn that the kind of love you desire changes as the years go by.  However, Western women cling to that idea that they should feel the same amount and kind of love they felt at twenty 20 years after being married.  It is a perverse thought that leaves the Western world full of women who are unsure how to satisfy their basic emotional desires of all ages.  Women can be married early and live happy, rich, and fulfilling lives if both parties accept that things will change and don't let the relationship become stagnant. 

Edit:  I would like to add a simile.  It is like a grown man refusing to let go of his childhood toys.  He clings to the feelings of the past and we as a loosely defined culture ostracize and mock him, not without good reason as well.  Why can't we do the same with women and love?  Why don't we mock them for expecting the same lovey dovey stuff they felt as a teenager as an adult?

And before this even comes up, I am not advocating women settle with any guy she meets and ""loves"" on the chance they will stay together.  Finance and the man himself should be judged based on his ability to be a supporting husband/father but the money has become the driving point of marriage in our society rather than the want of raising children with input of both parents or supporting each other.  

Also, about those advocating marrying foreign women, that idea only works up to Eastern Europe until cultural views make it a worse gamble than marrying a local woman.  All the ideas we have about marriage are Western and women from different cultures view marriage differently.  I don't want a completely submissive woman who answers my every beck and call.  I could manage that for a much lower cost by hiring a maid and a prostitute.  I want some kind of bond that says my life partner will stay and we will change through the years together, influencing each others change in positive ways and that the woman I decide to have children with won't steal them away in the night and then demand money from me.  I can find that here even though it is extremely rare but foreign women (I assuming foreign meaning non-European dominant powers) will often marry out of obligation and for security, the only difference being they want your money their entire lives instead.  A woman like that would probably not consider me as the ""father"" in the idealized Western version I want.  I am the wrong generation to look for soulmates right now and it doesn't look like the spoiled women of today are teaching their daughters any better. 

 I can only pray that I can find a good woman before I turn 35 or I will just pay for an egg and have it artifically inseminated and put in a surrogate mother.  An extremely costly procedure but one I could guarantee would allow me to shape my children into the people I would want them to be.  I would pay the same price I would pay for a modest house for a half clone.  In the end, it might be the safest and cheapest of the two options.   Much better than being a ""weekend warrior"" (No offense to the men forced into this situation).  My dad is and has been there my entire life to support me when I am weak and then toughen me up when I can stand on my own two feet as well as my mother.  It has been a major part in helping me become what I am today and I will damned if I can't do the same or better for my children. ","1283303347"

What is your evidence for this claim?  I'm a teachers union steward, and we have tenured teachers getting fired every year.  All the administration has to do is prove to us in union leadership that a) the teacher has received unsatisfactory performance evaluations, b) that he's been told which areas he needs to improve, and c) that he's been given sufficient time and support to improve his job performance.  

The vast majority of the time, they're able to do just that, and I've seen many teachers -- friends, even -- fired quite justifiably.  Every now and again, though, the admin tries to fire someone for ""poor teaching"" without even bothering to observe the teacher in class, or something like that.  In that case, we have to step in and fight for the person's job because of the pretty self-explanatory principle that you can't say someone's bad at something if you have no evidence one way or the other.

You fill the bong with water, so that the downslide (the little tube that goes down into the bowl, that the slider sits in) is covered with water. (This is where the filtration comes from). You want there to be enough air left at the top of the chamber that you don't suck up water when you hit it, especially not when you pull extra hard to clear it. Bongs are kind of a waste with good trees, because I like the taste of good green through clean glass. BUT, they let you take huge hits, so one or two good rips can destroy you, if your bud's good enough. If you only have mids, bongs are a great smoking aid, so you can smoke A LOT, and have it be smooth. Most people will tell you to fill your bong with ice water or cold water, because it cools the smoke. This is true, but if you fill your bong with hot water, it filters the smoke A LOT better, and actually gives you a much less harsh hit. This is ideal. It takes a bit of getting used to, some people never grow to like it. It's like a sauna, for your lungs/throat. If you have a bong with an ice pick, you're set. Fill the bottom with hot water, and load up the neck with ice. Then the hot water filters, and the ice cools the smoke before you hit it, giving you pretty much the perfect hit.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","OK, you really have to watch those videos. If she was holding you around the waist, that's an IOI, she is comfortable getting close to you. You are going to have to get over the reluctance to do kino. I had this myself, and I forced myself to do it, and last week (oh read my epic FR) I was squeezing girl's butts within 2 minutes of meeting them, and they were kissing me back. The thing is, you have to kino early. If you hang around with a woman and don't touch her until you've been talking for 10 minutes, she's going to wonder, ""why is he touching me *now?*"" But if you start kino early, and touch her within seconds of meeting her, you are setting a level of comfort immediately, and can escalate. And then she will escalate. That is when you know you are seducing her: she responds to your touch. 

I mean, seriously, what do you think you're going to do, just hang out with her at arms length, and then suddenly move in for the kiss? If you're not comfortable touching a woman, you're showing her you're not comfortable with intimate touching. And how the hell are you going to stick your penis in her without intimate touching? Just get the mindset that you are a touchy-feely guy and this is perfectly normal. Girls expect that, and they need it. We need it a woman's touch too.

[Read this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/bpx0p/exercise_touch_everyone_you_talk_to/)  That's what got me started being comfortable with touching people. Practice on everyone. Practice on strangers that you don't care how they react, and that you'll probably never see again (like maybe girls in a bar). You will be surprised that your touch will not be perceived as creepy as you think. Women will give you a lot of slack, especially if they like you. ","1283303364"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I decided to take my dog - 120 lb American Bulldog - to an out of the way park for a little exercise. This was after a heavy rain the day before, but whatever he needs a bath anyway, whats a little mud? So I let him off the leash to run around, he is listening well and being retarded (if you know the American Bulldog mentality, you know what I mean). Well I hadnt been to this park in years and forgot a river ran through it at one point. He saw/heard/smelled the water when we were about 200 yards away and he hauled ass to it with no warning. By the time I caught up he had jumped from a 6 foot cliff and was being swept downstream - remember those heavy rains I mentioned, yeah - he could have made it back to the shore but he saw a stick in the river and decided to chase it DOWNSTREAM. So I am running along the river screaming, throwing rocks trying to distract him from the stick so he will lose sight of it and swim back to me. But it was too late, the water current too strong and he was weakening in front of me. Then he went under and my heart sank. So out comes the wallet and cell, off come the shoes and I jump in the river (not quite as efficient as say, David Hasselhoff, but it got the job done). I swim out, dive under, grab him and pull him to shore. Push him up the bank and collapse out of breath. What does he do? Jumps back in the river after another stick. I dont think so MOTHERFUCKER! I grab him as he leaps, tackle him, and drag him up the bank, attach his leash, tie him to a tree and collapse. As I catch my breath I here whispers from somewhere. I look up and a little asian couple are standing there slack jawed with a camera in hand. They photographed the whole thing!! Unfortunately they spoke no English and were a little scared, I never saw them again and as far as I know the pics havent surfaced

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Here's a list of the women I see at the gym, starting with the ones I have the most respect and admiration for at the top...

The ones I see in the weights area doing squats and other BB work...  
The ones I see in the weights area but who only use the machines...  
The ones I only see in the cardio area...  
The one who comes in, spends an hour on the elliptical and then leaves...

The really, really large one who I saw ride by one day on her scooter while eating from a box of crackers.  She was scootering on her way *to* the store next door.  

I kinda feel bad for the really overweight ones I only see using the various ab machines.  I get the impression they think they can crunch and twist their stomach away.

If I saw you working out I'd probably be quite impressed, especially if you were doing your lifts with good form.  

That all holds true for men, too, though.  I usually more impressed by seeing someone using good form than I am by the weight they're moving.  For the most part I have respect for anyone who's at the gym trying to better themselves.

"comics","t5_2qh0s","I disagree, but it was the obvious way to go with the story. Dora has already shown that she has serious trust issues. She blew up on Marty once over cutting his hair, this was bound to cause an issue. She has made it very clear that her self esteem issues have created a serious lack of trust in Marty and Faye (due to her low opinions of herself, not of a low opinion of them). Take it from a person who has had a multiple year relationship with a person that has serious trust and self esteem issues, this is a very real and possible outcome.

The beauty of QC is that there are so many comics that make up a single day. I don't think it's within Dora's character to stay on this angry streak for more than a day or two without realizing she's acting stupid. With that said a day or two can be two or three dozen comics easily creating an entire new plot line. This plot can branch out into an Angus plot with him coming to see Faye at CoD and instead getting an earful of what happened last night. It can lead do a few comics of conversation between Marty and Tai, even Dora and Tai after Marty talks to his boss.

So I think it seems contrived because it was the obvious way to go, but this is certainly well within the well founded personalities of the characters. I for one am looking forward to seeing where this goes in the next month.","1283303435"

"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","Anoxic water (""dead zones""), while a contributor to stress on corals and definitely not a good thing, is not the proximate cause of mass bleaching events (it is nearly unmentioned in fact in the literature on corals).  And mass bleaching events *definitely* do not have a strong correlation to 'dead zones'. The two are completely distinct phenomena.


Corals, and the fish associated with them, appear relatively tolerant of low oxygen levels: [Hypoxia in paradise: widespread hypoxia tolerance in coral reef fishes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1810002/pdf/15101411.pdf)

The **most common** cause of mass coral bleaching is changes in the temperature of the water they live in. In 1998 **16%** of the world's coral died from thermally induced bleaching during the El Nino event of that year.

[Coral Bleaching - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching)

[Widespread Coral Bleaching in 1998](http://www.drmartinwilliams.com/coralbleaching/coralbleaching.html)

&gt; Mass bleaching events were not even recorded until 1979, since when they have become almost commonplace, with most linked to water temperatures higher than the warmest the affected locations normally experience.

[Coral Bleaching Events and Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly Hot Spots, 1997 - 1998](http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/coastal-marine/map-207.html)

&gt;One direct measure of coral stress is the phenomenon of coral bleaching and mortality associated with widespread elevated sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the last decade (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999). This is frequently associated with warm temperatures and has been widely predicted to increase in the future. Exposure for one month at temperatures 1 or 2 degrees Celsius higher than the mean averages at the warmest time of year is sufficient to cause the corals to bleach. This map shows the distribution of SST anomalies and coral bleaching events, during one of the largest El Niño events of this century, from late 1997 until mid-1998. Although some records of local coral bleaching date back decades, reports of widespread bleaching have been increasing in recent years. The most recent event was not only widespread, but was also more severe in many areas than earlier events. Actual coral death reached 95 percent in some locations. In a few places massive, centuries-old corals have died; in some other places there has now been at least a partial recovery, with loss of only a few corals. 

[Caribbean reefs suffer severe coral bleaching event](http://news.mongabay.com/2005/1220-reefs.html)

&gt;The Caribbean experienced one of the most devastating coral bleaching events on record during September and October while hurricanes battered the Gulf of Mexico. In response, NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have sent a team to assess the situation.
&gt;	
&gt;Warnings of the onset of the bleaching event were first reported by the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Satellite Bleaching Alert monitoring system in late August in the Florida Keys. The bleaching spread through much of the eastern Caribbean in September and October.
&gt;
&gt;According to scientists in Puerto Rico, bleaching is both widespread and intense with colonies representing 42 species completely white in many reefs. Surveys show 85 to 95 percent of coral colonies were bleached in some areas, while reefs in Grenada suffered close to 70 percent bleaching in some areas.
&gt;
&gt;Coral bleaching is associated with a variety of physiological stresses, the most important of which is elevated sea surface temperatures. Bleaching causes coral to expel symbiotic zooxanthellae algae living in their tissues  algae that provide corals with nourishment. Losing their algae leaves coral tissues devoid of color, and thus appearing to be bleached. Corals can recover from short-term bleaching, but prolonged bleaching (over a week) can cause irreversible damage and subsequent death

A key takeaway from that last article is that bleaching events are actually being *predicted* before they happen by satellite measurements of ocean temperatures.","1283303473"

America was founded by Puritans, which laid the ground for a lot of the American ethos. A major of those is: no drinking in public. So many issues swirl around alcohol; like Homer said, ""Alcohol: the cause of, and solution too, all of life's problems.""

Liquor licenses are considered licenses to print money. They are highly controlled by organized crime. I've heard say that it costs $100K+ to get one in some cities.

It might not be quite as classy as you'd think, since it'd have to be all plastic stemware. I mean, have you ever seen the ""average person"" carrying a glass object?

It's about cops, the main character straddles the line between good and bad, and the show centers a lot around the main character trying to get himself ouf of the jams he's created for himself.  Additionally there are other members of the force who are just ""good cops"" and don't know what the main character is up to, and the few who suspect something are typically after him to bring him down.  

Of course, IMO The Shield is far superior to Dexter, but for someone who's looking for another show like Dexter, this is probably a really good thing.  Seven seasons, 88 episodes.  Trust me, you won't regret it.","1283303599"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","If you're not going to race cross, maybe you should look at some bikes that are skewed toward the utility side of the spectrum.

At any rate, the things I'd keep in mind are:
1) Mounting options for racks &amp; fenders.  A messenger bag might be fine if you don't have much to carry.  Fenders are a must if you ride in the rain though.
2) Tire clearance.  For bad roads you'll probably want something that can handle 28mm tires, maybe even wider.  Keep in mind that tire clearance decreases when you add fenders.
3) Stay away from wheels built for weight savings.  Go with wheels that offer 24 or more spokes, laced in a 3x (Each spoke crosses 3 others) pattern.  That way you don't have to worry about your wheels going out of true when you hit a pothole.
4) Disc brakes probably aren't as necessary for a commuter as the previous 3 points, but they offer better braking in the wet than rim brakes.

Not all cross bikes offer fender/rack mounting options, and some come from the factory with lightweight wheels designed for racing instead of durability.  Most cross bikes won't offer disc brakes, as they weren't allowed in officially sanctioned races until very recently.","1283303601"

This is not meant to be insulting, but rather to push you into learning the context for all of these figures you are given in class. There are thousands of books on the subject (make sure you avoid the Michael Moore/Anne Coulter like books, there are enough factual books).","1283303675"

I think the person who wrote it originally, and other people who hold the same view have the best of intentions. However, based on the experiences of my own life, this idea does not hold up in practice. Boys and young men are not being educated about and involved in gender issues to the same degree that women are, and as a result, I feel that there has been more progress made on female issues and stereotypes than on their male counterparts.

Nor does pointing out an exception to a rule disprove a rule.  In a normal person, logical thinking and deductive abilities are always key to being good at math.

There are very few mathematically inclined savants, most identified as such by the media aren't mathematically inclined, they're arithmetically inclined.  They're great at counting, adding, subtracting, dividing.  Find one that's good at more advanced math and you'll find a logical mind for the things they're capable of understanding.  That they can't apply such logic to their weak areas like interpersonal relationships is due to a malfunctioning brain.

&gt; just because mathematical ability is normally accompanied by proclivity toward complex logical thinking and deduction doesn't mean they are necessarily related.

Nor does it imply they aren't related, so it's a rather meaningless statement.  Correlation doesn't imply causation but correlation is a necessary precondition for causation.  There simply is a causal relationship between logical deductive thinking and math; one leads to the other.

I don't know much about the hard psychological data regarding abortion, but as a history minor I know that abortion has been historically commonplace in many societies.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","Well, The general consensus apparently does not agree with the IPCC. The IPCC states that 90% of the warming in the first half of the last century was due to Green House Gases. The IPCC tracks emissions of GHGs from 1750. and asserts they have a substantial warming influence since that time. 
The influence of Solar irradiance is of course downplayed and the difference in TSI during the early to mid 1900's is not thought to have played a major part in the warming of those years.

http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm    Chapter nine.

Given the position of the IPCC (the consensus if you will.) Are you still willing to  say the warming in the first part of the last century is due to solar irradiance?

I was surprised to see these statements, I suppose that it should be no surprise as your position was being dismantled by skeptics due to identical rates of warming when slow rates of CO2 increase were occurring.

Now skeptics have to counter a new argument. The CO2 in the atmosphere has been causing temperature increases since 1750 not since 1970.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;which still means that they willingly chose to stay ignorant and stick to an irrational belief.

i think this is an existential question, and frankly, it is one that is not as cut-and-dried as you would have it seem.  

what *reason* would a human mind have to willfully stick to an irrational belief?  that is a question that you no doubt have some canned answer to: fear of death, for instance (a fairly legitimate fear, and one that is hard-wired into our neurons), a general lack of curiosity, perhaps. whatever the reason, in your estimation, it must be *willful*.  one must willfully get past one's fear of death in order to see that which you see.  one must willfully make one's self curious.   

but there are a number of *reasons* that the human mind may rationalize its adherence to an irrational belief system, and each of these *reasons* has its own rationale, none of which need be willful: the reason could be one of necessity, or a desire to conform, or to receive the benefits of belonging to the dominant culture.  such decisions can be largely unconscious, despite their complexity, and they often weigh multiple factors. even the desire of most humans for comforting surroundings plays its part in this largely unconscious process.  but perhaps an over-arching theme for each of these is pragmatism: what benefits the organism itself, and what benefits the group to which the organism belongs?

after all, the question of whether or not there is a god may have a profound impact on intellectual movements, on world events, on the laws of the land, or on the education of our children, but honestly, when you are not much more than a mammal with an oversized cerebral cortex, whether or not god exists has very little bearing on your day-to-day survival.  this is an intellectual consideration, not an instinctual one, and instinct cares not at all for what is not directly in front of its face.

this form of rationality has little to do with science, the scientific method, *a priori* reasoning, or logic, in the formal sense. i know of no basis for anyone to contend that these higher-order reasoning processes are innate, although you seem to think they are (or more likely, should be).  the human mind is demonstrably rational about a great many things, most of them mundane, but using reason to think yourself out of a social schema into which religion has been intricately and inextricably woven is no easy task.

i am also not at all convinced that people willingly choose to remain irrational, as this presupposes that they are able to recognize that their thought processes are irrational to begin with.  not everyone on this planet (some atheists included) is capable of this degree of introspection, nor is everyone afforded the same access to information required to come to the conclusion that their beliefs are untenable.  after all, you would say (quite rightly) that there is no evidence for the existence of god, but a true believer would merely tell you to open your eyes.  *how did all of this get here?  by chance? well that seems highly unlikely!  more sensible is the idea that some divine watchmaker laid it all out beforehand, of course.* hell, if you don't really understand occam's razor, then the idea that some deity created everything not only seems sensible, but actually the most likely explanation.  believe me, i've heard that argument quite often from theists.  

also, i do not think that children who have been inculcated by the society in which they are reared are choosing to think irrationally.  at what age does a child achieve the sentience necessary to begin questioning the things that it has been taught to be true its entire life?   is it unreasonable to assume that a person should recognize, *a priori*, that their belief is irrational?  would such an assumption not then presume some sort of innate rationality in the human mind that must willfully be suppressed, as you suggest?  wherefore this innate rationality?  there may be evidence of it, but i confess i haven't done my research.

additionally, how many issues that might arise in any given court case bear even a passing resemblance to the metaphysical, ontological or teleological questions posed by religion?  how does belief in a god make it more likely that a person will deliberately ignore whatever evidence may be present in a blood spatter, or how an alibi may be corroborated by a sequence of events, for instance?  

no mystery that a jury might be expected to unravel is as complicated or as abstract as the question: ""how did i get here?"" in my opinion, what you expect from potential jurors is roughly akin to a math teacher requiring her students to own a scientific calculator just to perform simple addition.    

&gt;I can state that all religious people are irrational. 

you can, and you have.  and i can state that no person, religious or otherwise, can be conclusively labeled as rational or irrational, because the state of being rational or irrational is not a constant, but is situationally dependent.  rationality is a response to one's environment, not something that exists in a vacuum.  your explanation is simplistic, over-broad, and presupposes rationality to be a passive state of mind, rather than a process of engagement with events or information.  

how does the human mind develop rationality, by the way?  

&gt;They are irrational for holding a position to be true that is not at all suffieciently discussed and which has many arguments to be hold against it.

that's just the problem, though.  if they ""are"" irrational, how are they able to make rational decisions?  how does belief in a god prevent a person from making a monthly budget (to use a more quotidian example of rational behavior)?  how does belief in a god prevent a person from making rational decisions in every other aspect of his or her life? 

i can tell you from personal experience with certain redditors that lack of belief in a god has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on their ability to think rationally about a host of other issues.  

if i could demonstrate that you, an agnostic, nevertheless believed in something called ""human nature"" -- a clearly ontological concept that cannot be verified through empirical evidence or the scientific method -- would it be fair then to label you as irrational?

or is “human nature” a *slightly* more rational metaphysical concept than “god,” and so therefore passes muster, according to your absolute bar, despite the dearth of evidence for its existence, outside of  poetry and philosophy?

metaphysical questions are ones that require higher-order reasoning skills, and not every brain comes so equipped.  fortunately for us, your ""absolute bar"" for burden of proof is just as ephemeral as the god neither of us believes in.

&gt;There are no such examples. All religious people are exactly as what you define as that ""blanket statement"" of mine.

of course there are no examples, so long as one takes at face value your (dubious and unsupported) claim that a religious person ""is"" irrational.  

i do get that you would rather eliminate from the jury pool those who have, in the past, demonstrated irrationality by believing in something for which no proof exists.  i can't fault you (or the law) for erring on the side of caution, i suppose.  but in my estimation, there is no evidence to suggest that a belief in god can affect a person's ability to examine the evidence in a court case and to deliver a reasoned verdict.  

your ""if they did it once, they might do it again!"" response fails to take into account that rationality and irrationality are not two sides to a coin, but two points in a venn diagram, and child-murdering school teachers aside (a poor analogy, really, given that nearly everyone believes in god, and almost no one murders children), you have a long way to go towards proving your assertion that religious people are incapable of, or even less likely to, deliver an impartial verdict in a given court case.  sure, child-murdering teachers have no business working for elementary schools.  and people who believe in god have no business weighing in on a case where their belief in god is *directly related* to the specific issues put before the court.

your murderous school teacher can find another job picking up garbage after her debt to society has been paid.

like i said: religious people have been making rational decisions in court for centuries.  in point of fact, every juror is reminded by the judge to consider the evidence carefully, if i'm not mistaken.   

i'm sorry, but it seems to me to be the height of sloppy thinking to assume that a person ""is"" irrational, based on one thing, no matter how ""fundamental"" you might personally feel that thing is to a person's mental ability.  

as an atheist, i don't think the question of god's existence is fundamental to much of anything at all.

i sympathize with your position; religious people do seem to be quite irrational ... concerning things that revolve around religion.  outside of that, the matter remains open to debate.

p.s. - something about excluding jurors based on their religion strikes me as unconstitutional.  i mentioned that earlier, but i think it bears repeating.","1283303788"

He said he was in contact with the family.   So I was listening and reading.  

Of course, the clock console radio not working in daves accord that he posted could never have happened.

He had the easy ability to just hand me my ass right there, you see, and i goaded him into doing it and he should have been mad enough to prove me wrong, yet he didn't do it.

Then when another website posted that the cell phone was turned off on a certain date (I forget the date), this guy goes in and edits the post and says that the phone was off and his brother did not have it.    He did another edit when he said he did not know his brothers roommate and business partner (dave edison - the guy who killed him) and changed it so he did not say that.

"law","t5_2qh9k","By ""taking it just once for the record,"" do you mean the actual LSAT? If so, then yes--schools don't want to see multiple attempts unless you have a very good reason. 

I took the October test and probably started studying for it sometime the summer before (I can't remember exactly when). That worked out well because I had my score early and could fill out applications with it in hand. I don't think that taking it in December would hurt you, though, and if you think your score will be higher by then, it's probably a better idea. A difference of even a couple points can make or break you in getting into a school or getting a scholarship. Sometimes there's actually a gap in assigned scores so that getting one more question right could potentially bump you up two points rather than just one. The school I wound up at I actually applied to on literally the last day possible, so whether I had taken the Oct or Dec would not have mattered (it was well after Dec that I applied). 

As for ramp-up time, I can't really say. I think my goal was to take a test once a week and I wound up skipping some because I didn't have enough time. You could compress a schedule and take them more often, though, depending on your situation. It probably will depend on your schedule and how quickly you think you can get comfortable with the test.

If you've done your homework, you're doing far better than most. Even now, with people practically decrying law school from the rooftops, some people come in with their eyes closed. I wasn't totally naive going in, but I certainly could have been a lot more savvy. It sounds like you've thought it out better than I had.

My UG school actually had a pre-law advisement center that was useful for questions like yours. If your school has one, you could probably get solid advice there. They would give you far better advice than I could on the Oct v Dec question. I would also recommend scouring the web for advice and tips on timing, etc. ","1283303865"

"comics","t5_2qh0s","I have to say it's weird to see someone defending Lamarckian-style evolution through acquired characteristics.

I get the feeling that you don't understand the nuances, I'll sum them up for the benefit of other readers curious about the topic.

When powercow says that ""the changes happen in the life-time of the creature"" he doesn't mean that a protogiraffe stretched real hard and grew 12 feet, he means that the protogiraffe stretched real hard and grew, say, an eighth of an inch. Protogiraffe Sr. then passed on this characteristic it **acquired** throughout its lifetime onto Protogiraffe Jr. Protogiraffe Jr. then did the same and passed on now a total quarter inch of growth to Protogiraffe III.

Lamarck's views on adapting to the environment is thus almost (or at least superficially) true, but it assumes that the **characteristics** are acquired in life, not through natural selection or the survival of the fittest species in an ecological niche and then carried on in the genetics of the species.

The comic reflects this by showing the giraffe ""struggling"" to stretch his neck out. We see the the illustrated life and times of the Protogiraffe family.

The Darwinian view is that there are genetic mutations occuring **by random chance**. These changes are largely benign, neither beneficial but not really detrimental. If a change is not detrimental, then it remains to be passed on, whether or not it's actually beneficent; if the change is detrimental, and the offspring dies before having a chance to reproduce to pass on the malignant mutation, then it is removed from the gene pool (We say selected against). Eventually a change (or a combination of heretofore benign mutations) helps a species to branch off into a new ecological niche. 

Unlike Lamarck, this more nuanced view suggests that evolution happens by random chance more than force of will. A giraffe can't wish its neck longer .000001 inches any more than it can 12 feet and then pass that wish onto successive generations, but if by random chance that taller giraffe was better able to acquire food, then the mutation would be selected for (not against), and the trait passed on through genetics.

There are three other methods that Darwin defines as engines of evolution, but natural selection is the strongest.

Funny that you mention him hating his fans. After the ending of the series, the creator received countless hate mail and even death threats from outraged fans. He gave them an ending none of them wanted, let alone could truly understand. In the first moments of the DVD (with the live action) they actually show some flashes of the threats he received. I suppose after reading and hearing about that, he was seemingly forced to make a different ending. A sort of fan service ending to replace the original.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;As I see it, this is the number one issue that faces modern Christians. Too many 'Christians' have strayed far from the loving, forgiving, peace promoting, child friendly Christ of the Bible to a hideous distortion of Christianity.

I couldn't agree more. A lot of them are clambering after law-keeping, Old Testament style, forgetting that we've been freed from all of that. It needs fixing. And the problem is, a lot of non-Christians see and hear so much from that side that they think that's what Christianity is all about, and that's *not* what it's really all about!

&gt;One of the reasons there is so much antagonism to Christianity on Reddit is because many Redditors have had horrendous experiences of growing up in so-called Christian families or communities. It's clear some of them have been badly damaged by their experience at the hands of Christians. That's inexcusable.

I agree. I've read a few posts lately from people like this that made me hurt inside for all the abuse they've experienced. 

&gt;It seems to me some of our brothers and sisters may have lost sight of the core values and principles of Christianity. We need to remind them that the most important part of Christianity lies in its first six letters.

I say amen to that. It isn't an outward show or a bunch of rules - it's a relationship with our Creator and Saviour. 

I'm with you on this! This is *exactly* what needs to be done. The question is, how? We can't change hearts, really - we can only be a good example ourselves of what a true Christian is. Personal revival is what we need.



EDIT to add - it does me good to see so many Christians here on Reddit. It seems like most of the time, when our faith is discussed, most of the remarks are hostile ""Christians are retards and we're so enlightened""-type remarks from atheists, even in the Christianity subreddit. So it's nice to see a calm discussion and fellow believers. I didn't think I'd ever find that on this site.  : )    ","1283303910"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; why not move under the Libertarian umbrella?

The answer, if I may rudely interrupt, is that Libertarianism, for all its faults, attempts to be a consistent intellectual movement.  They try to reconcile part A of their philosophy with part B, and recognize that to get X they need to give up Y.

The Tea Party is based on vague discontent and anger and on not thinking too hard.  They are 55/5 Republican/Democrat with about 1/3 independents, and they blame the black guy for big government after 8 years of white guy deficits and spending increases.      The Libertarian component is very small.

tl;dr: Libertarians will tell you exactly what they want.  TPs will only tell you they're discontented, and when they do tell you what they want, they won't reconcile the internal contradictions.   The thinkers (whether one agrees with their thinking) are an insignificant fringe.

Plus a good PSU doesn't become outdated (computer parts are using less wattage per generation, not more). One of the advantages of building it  yourself is certain parts can be used over and over and the PSU is one of those. Invest in something good now and it will last you several builds.

We can make the distinction using maths, but when talking amongst each other we prefer to label the different mathematical descriptions as flavors.  If you take said maths and do a little dance, the maths eventually let you know that neutrinos should theoretically have mass.  This is hard to fathom because they zoom through the universe at near the speed of light and hardly ever interact with anything.  They're like almost 'invisible', but since the maths say they can change flavors but it takes time and massless particles don't know what time is, they must have mass.  Mass is also lesson time at the church and the priest wants the neutrino to go.","1283303961"

Second, let's say that they did this.  Currently, vendors eat credit fraud losses.  Would a vendor want to sign up for a merchant account with a card issuer that didn't immediately stop card use until the fact that the card was still present was verified?

You could make the *consumer* eat credit fraud losses, but how many people would want to sign up for a card that did that?  Heck, doing this may even be prohibited by regulators.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;OK, listen, this is going off the rails. Why don't you tell me exactly what your definition is of an implicit contract and then an explicit contract.

A *contract* is an agreed-to obligation between two parties for a transfer of goods. A contract is a bit more than an *exchange*, which is why it is more formalized than a one-off barter.

*Explicit* contracts are those that have a legal, physical document, called **The Contract** that both parties sign. Both parties agree to abide by the terms of **The Contract**, whether those terms be actually written into the physical contract, or referred to in the physical contract.

*Implicit* contracts are contracts (see definition above) that do not require a formal agreement, where consent is ascertained rather than explicitly stated, by the inaction or action of either party. There are usually still terms and they are usually still explicitly stated, but usually in the form of a placard (in the case of a place of business) or documents that a vendor might refer you to in terms of questions. 

When determining if a contract is conscionable, a third party arbitrator will refer to [the elements of a binding contract](http://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/contract_law.html) and see what applies. If an alleged contract claim (usually in the form of a property claim for payment) meets the standards for the elements of a contract, then the arbitrator will uphold the property claim for payment on behalf of the party on the other party.
&gt;Particularly in terms of implicit contracts your definition of what they are keeps changing, and you keep referring to signed contracts to describe implicit contracts. So lets nail down exactly what we are talking about.

This is precisely what I'm talking about. We're talking about *contracts* , and for the most part the differences between implicit and explicit contracts are minimal. I.e. if an explicit contract of a certain type (like for cell phones or insurance) is considered binding, then an implicit contract of the same kind or service is **just as binding**.

When you ask how implicit contracts can do such and such, I'm showing you *contracts* that do such and such, and trying to tell you that the fact that a particular contract is implicit rather than explicit doesn't change the fact that those contracts are binding.","1283303996"

Any potential game programmers out there, get a CS degree and make a game on your own time.  It's only hard to get a game programming job if you aren't a good programmer, aren't passionate about games (this actually matters, not personally to me though) or aren't willing to relocate.  The rest of the trick is knowing how to interview well.

You're being ignorant if you choose to ignore the very reason something you find humorous is indeed humorous to you.

Your narrow world view is further proven by the fact you choose to assert things in absolutes. You see it one way so that's how it is. There are no ""exceptions"" as far as you're concerned. Except so far in history there are. Cunt is an old Anglo Saxon word. It's been about half a millennium and it's still pretty much one of the worst words you can utter in respectable company. Doesn't seem to be moving towards changing very fast either. Try affectionately calling your mother a cunt today, see how it goes down.

You should also look up irony and bone up on it. I'm aware of a small cabal of very anal Redditors who like calling out the wrong use of the word. Not sure what the irony is here unless you're mixing up the racial slur Nigger with the Spanish word for black from which it derived.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Disregarding OP, you made an assertion that choosiness and a (and this is subjective) wholesome sexual view is a byproduct of a religious society.

I desire sex often, and have chosen to fulfill those desires with a monogamous partner. I'm not a tight ass and CERTAINLY not religious for choosing not to participate in the casual sex/one night stand culture. Sex is very important to me, as is who I allow inside my body, and I chose to express that by having monogamous sex within a long term relationship with a single partner. Just because I don't love to fuck just anyone doesn't mean I don't love to fuck.

I have ABSOLUTELY no qualms with people who choose to participate in casual sexual activity, but to make the argument that ones being protective of their own physiology and thereby sexuality is prompted by society when in my case at least the action is prompted by a desire to keep my sexuality valuable and related to love, is entirely unfair.

Some people, like yourself, find sexuality trivial. I disagree. And I will happily take downvotes for having an unpopular opinion (that is, not sleeping around)","1283304035"

How much exhaust normally comes out of there in a 40 day period, and how quickly is it dispersed? Was there any statistically significant difference in the quantity of contaminates in the air? The article only briefly touched on this issue, citing BP:

&gt;BP maintains three air monitors along the fence around the plant and two in the surrounding community, and they did not show a rise in pollution during April and May, the company said.

The author then goes on to quote residents who anecdotally reported an increase in health problems during the time. No reference to any actual medical records or a comparison versus the same weeks in previous years.","1283304042"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Early on in my spanking career, I experimented with many substances to help ""enhance"" the job: lotion, noxema, shampoo... pretty much anything I could find in the bathroom while I was showering (my preferred locale).  One time, I found the mentholatum jar and was intrigued by the minty smell.  I jump in the shower and start working it up when my dad knocks on the door needing to use the bathroom, which is normal with only one bathroom shared by four.  He comes in and nearly starts choking on the smell.  Little did I know, the hot shower enhanced the already powerful smell of mentholatum.  He remarks, ""it smells like a mentholatum bomb in here!""  I say nothing and listen to him pee.  I don't masturbate in the shower anymore.

TL;DR: Don't masturbate in the shower with mentholatum when sharing a bathroom with 3 other people.","1283304051"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am installing weblogic remotely right now for a client, over vpn. I work as a freelancer, both for development and IT work. Depending on where you are, the technical details for getting started are going to be different. But, all you really need is a group of clients and social security number.

Finding clients is the real trick and most of my work has come from referrals. You have to seed that by getting your first few customers and doing an over-achieving job for them, and let them you know the other ways you can help them or any other department or person they know. If you do a good job, they will be happy to refer you to their colleagues.

Avoid working for people paying ""out of pocket"". That is, people on craigslist or any other site looking to get a project launched and they are paying for it out of their own bank account vs. a company account. These folks tend to low-ball the hell out of you and expect unrealistic results. Unless the prospect is fully aware of the potential costs and is approaching the job as a business deal vs. some personal pet project they are looking to get done, you are taking a big risk.

Understand a lot of customers will want fixed cost quotes vs. hourly. In fact, many will not want to accept hourly unless it's very low, like $30p/h. In these cases, make sure you have a list of requirements listed out to spell out exactly what you will be providing and what the client is responsible for delivering to you in order for you to meet those requirements.

I just got off the phone today with a client where the project dragged out to a year when it was supposed to be only two months. We both agreed that we were both part to blame for the scope creep and the delays. It did not end badly, in fact, it ended up with more work down the road. But make sure you honestly asses the time-lines involved, if you are doing something that requires discovery make it clear there are ""unknowns"" and your estimate could be incorrect, and if you are doing something that requires you use a skill not fully developed but you are capable of perfecting, let them know this too. It will be your worst nightmare if you are promising to deliver something by a certain date on something you feel you should be able to do, but have never done before. The client will both appreciate and respect you for having a can-do and positive attitude, while letting them know you could be wrong about it.

Lastly, communication and status updates are key. I suck at this, but it's the best way to keep a client happy, even if you are late a lot. Letting them know where you are at, showing incremental progress, and responding to their emails within 24 hours will keep a client happy even in unhappy circumstances.

Best of luck getting started.","1283304060"

People that get in Express Lanes or Self-Checkout Lanes at grocery stores and want to buy cigarettes.

Argh!  I have a melting pint of ice cream and a dozen warming eggs ready to go and now the cashier has wandered off, slowly making her way to the locked up cabinets in the back, looking for the cigarettes you want to buy.  She finds them, but doesn't have the key, so she has to find a member of management to open it for her.  They open it, bring it over, you bitch that it's the wrong one, and the whole cycle starts over again.

As an ex-smoker, you can go die in a fire.  Get your cigs from a gas station like a normal person.  Or wait in the normal line where people are not in as much of a rush.  I swear, I imagine punching those people in the back of the head when they pull shit like that.  Worse, when I let them in front of me when I have three items and they have two and then they make their cigarette desires known.

Looking over the list and trying to come up with shows that aren't mentioned (mad men, sopranos, breaking bad, lost, the wire, sfu, deadwood, etc) ...

 * Curb Your Enthusiasm is great if you liked Seinfeld.  The most recent season even featured a lot of Seinfeld.

 * The Shield is pretty good for a gritty cop show, especially the first few seasons.

 * Rescue Me is also pretty good but it seems more (and more and more) of the same each season.  It needed a spark a while ago.

 * United States of Tara is great (although I've only seen the first season).

 * Freaks and Geeks was really good even though it was only on for a single season.

 * It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is a fresh comedy show.

 * I'm enjoying Californication (even if it is a guilty pleasure like Entourage).

 * Nip/Tuck was good for the first few seasons.

 * I haven't heard Battlestar Galactica mentioned.  I liked it and strangely my very non-sci-fi wife also liked it.

 * The West Wing is the absolute best political drama that has ever aired.

 * Although I've only watched the first season I really enjoyed Friday Night Lights.

 * The Office / 30 Rock / Community are good comedies.

 * 24 is probably the best action drama ever produced.  The quality of the seasons is at about a 50% ratio, however.

 * I enjoyed most of the show Alias.

 * And for a part scripted, part reality show, for some reason Rob &amp; Big always managed to crack me up.

Clearly, I watch a ton of television (although I've never been a cable subscriber my entire adult life).","1283304109"
"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","I've always been a big Lomborg fan.  Here is what I liked best about this article:

&gt;At the top were more direct public investment in research and development *rather than spending money on low carbon energy now*, and climate engineering.

This is an example of good stewardship, regardless of your position on global warming.  Ultimately, good policy is required to effect change.

&gt;""This is not about 'we have all got to live with less, wear hair-shirts and cut our carbon emissions'. It's about technologies, about realising there's a vast array of solutions.""

Much of the AGW movement, and the environmental movement in general suffers from a peculiar form of Luddite flavored guilt about belonging to a species with opposable thumbs capable of creating technology that can improve the quality of life.

"business","t5_2qgzg","*&gt;Every time he speaks about Wall Street the market is down. He gives investors no faith.*

The short term gyrations of the market should absolutely be ignored by all politicians.  It is nearly impossible to distinguish whether such things are caused by randomness, [manipulation](http://market-ticker.org/cgi-mt/akcs-www?archived-post=1895-Financial-Terrorism-You-Decide.html), or an independent and honest consensus of investors.

Further, 'investors' != majority of American citizens.  When 1% of the populace controls 50% of the wealth, and the bottom 50% of the populace controls &lt; 1% of the wealth, and the 49% in the middle outsources most of their wealth management to Wall Street, the opinion of the market is hardly democratically meaningful.

*&gt;The Volcker rule limits proprietary trading. That is limiting capitalism. This is how banks make money for themselves, by using their prop desks to earn for the firm.*

No, banks make money paying 2% for deposits and loaning 90% of that money back out at 3%, 4%, etc., and pocketing the difference.

Proprietary trading is just sophisticated gambling, and is the *last* thing you want pervading the banking system.  Hedge fund system, fine, but not the *banking* system.  It's not just prop trading, but the cowboy/gangsta attitude toward risk that comes with it and permeates the entire industry that the Volcker Rule intends to stop.

*&gt;-You cannot simply tell these banks to spin off their derivatives desks, its not that easy.*

The real solution to the derivatives problem is to require *all* derivatives to be traded on an open exchange, like the options markets, where margin requirements are enforced and every participant can see and compare the derivatives contracts.  This over-the-counter private dealing ultimately favors the parties with better information, usually the Wall Street insiders, who have had no problem exploiting the 'marks'.

*&gt;Without this they're investing with a blind eye.*

Clearly they were already doing that anyway.

*&gt;You're essentially encouraging citizens to stay out of investing in the markets/saving for retirement.*

The idea that investing in the markets = saving for retirement is shot, and will be for several more generations.","1283304162"

So Kate and her bf broke up and he went off home, she went for a walk to clear her head, couple of the others buggered off home with their bf/gf's, so I went to find Kate to make sure she's OK, well, I found her and she wasn't, she was stood on the top floor of the multi-storey car park, ready to jump off, I sprinted up the ramps to the top floor (6 floors), and stood up there at around midnight in the middle of winter talking to Kate trying to convince her not to jump, after about 45 minutes to an hour I'd managed to talk her out of it and walked her home to make sure she was OK.



Possibly the scariest moment of my life.

"needadvice","t5_2r367","You're probably just a) not putting enough effort into finding friends, and b) too off-center for other people to seek you out.

I'm in the same boat, except I don't really mind being more or less friendless.  I have aesthetic objections to spending effort towards finding and keeping friends; seems to me like the more effort you put into friendships, the faker they become.  But then, I've had perfect, effortless friendships in the past, so perhaps I'm jaded (these friendships were torn by outside forces, unfortunately).

Thinking about it, maybe it's just the goatee.  I've got one too.  Hmmm...this bears further study.  

Anyway, under normal circumstances I'd offer to be your friend, since you're not ugly and not stupid, but right now I have several things going on and I'm actually rather glad of the lack of social responsibilities.

Science presents a hypothesis and then only by failure to disprove that hypothesis is confidence gained.

Moreover, engineering seeks to solve problems.  For instance, a known problem was that in regions of the world with high-rice diets, many childhood developmental deficiencies occur due to a lack of vitamin A, sometimes resulting in death.

Engineers seek to create rice which includes vitamin A, and a proven technique to do so is to genetically modify existing strains of rice to create vitamin A.

Can you say that these GM crops are absolutely safe?  No.  Can you say the existing crops were absolutely safe?  Yes.  Can you make a non-scientific judgment that the known problem with non-GM food being corrected with GM food outweighs the unknown risk of using the GM crop?  Yes.

Of my mom's 8 siblings, she has always been a bit of a black sheep.  Not really in a rebellious way, or even intentional, but who she was was not necessarily who her parents thought she should be.  So when I was growing up, I always thought that *we* were the black sheep.  It was a group thing, my mom, my brother and I.  Us against the world... or whoever.  We were encouraged to be who and what we were, even if we screwed up.  She would just be there to help us fix it.  Whatever we were into (provided it wasn't harmful) it was cool.  It could have been very different.  After all my mom was religious (still a practicing Catholic) and was in the army while I was growing up.  It could, *should* have been a repressive household.  But it wasn't.  She was, is, awesome.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Firstly, you don't know what TL;DR means.

Secondly:

Currently arable land combined with organic farming could easily feed the world 5 times over. We already established yields can be equal, and unlike factory farming they are more often directly consumable. More so, you could keep doing so into the indefinite future, since it's resources are self renewing (soil management, human labour, and often as a result better water handeling too).

Thirdly:

It's factory farming that assumes unlimited resources and often unlimited arable land (since this method in many places consumes arable land) and often unlimited fresh water supplies (eg underground aquafiers) too. 

But you and I both know that both that those resources *are* finite, like hydrocarbonates and phosphor, and the rate of production vs demand is already dwindeling for those goods. So unlike organic farming, *we know with 100% certainty this model is not sustainable in the long term*.

Additionally even with all the resources we have available right now it will never be able to feed all people on the world on the type of diet it is oriented towards. This is mostly due to it's reliance on feeding mono-culture crops to livestock.

It's funny you assume that human labour is a problem for producing food, even with 100s of millions of people currently living on less than a dollar a day, but at the same time completely ignoring the fact that products based on things like oil, natural gas and phosphates are already known to be unable to meet demand if we switch to factory farming and the diets that go along with it to feed the whole world.","1283304255"

But arguments like that miss the broader picture. I don't see this as the end of all legalization efforts in the future, but as the beginning. The very points we argue now can all be ironed out in the future, once its shown that marijuana legalization really isn't all that bad, but it'd be impossible to pass a law like the Herer initiative in California, its too big of a step. Also, America is looking towards California right now. Washington has a large percentage of people in favor of legalization, and they have publicly said that they want to see how the federal government reacts to California first, but the government is interested in doing it. Colombia, Mexico, and Peru have also formed a panel and are willing to rethink marijuana legalization if California passes it.

That is the only way we can really oppose things like gambling or abortion or alcoholism: not by getting involved in local government and writing the Bible into the laws of the land, not by forcing nonbelievers to live the Christian life, but by taking the gospel to people as individuals. That girl you know who's pregnant and scared? Don't protest outside the local abortion clinic or make comments about how bad abortion is whenever you see her - take her a loaf of homemade banana bread, sit down and have some tea, and offer her hope.

"sports","t5_2qgzy","Warning, tax lawyer explanation ahead. It pisses me off the press won't just give us the rules. And by rules I mean not just the fluff you googled from the NCAA website but the real rules.

14.1.9 Provides the rules for Graduate student participation. Generally you have to participate at the same school you did in undergrad. 14.1.9.1 provides a “One Time Transfer Exception” for play in schools other than the institution from which the athlete previously received a degree. The student has to fulfill the conditions of the one-time transfer exception set forth in Bylaw 14.5.5.2.10 and have eligibility remaining per Bylaw 14.2.

Here is where it gets weird. 14.5.5.2.10 has four conditions a) through d). The athlete has to meet all of them. 14.5.5.2.10 also says, for graduate students look at 14.1.9.1, so you have a circular reference, each telling you to look to the rules of the other. 

The circular reference must mean that 14.1.9.1 trumps 14.5.5.2.10 to the extent they are inconsistent. Why? Because I don't see a way in hell that a graduate student could meet 14.5.5.2.10(a), if they played a major sport at a bowl subdivision football school, and, as we know, transfers have been allowed.

“14.5.5.2.10 One-Time Transfer Exception. The student transfers to the certifying institution from another four-year collegiate institution, and all of the following conditions are met (for graduate students, see Bylaw 14.1.9.1):
(a)	 The student is a participant in a sport other than baseball, basketball, bowl subdivision football or men’s ice hockey at the institution to which the student is transferring. A participant in championship subdivision football at the institution to which the student is transferring may use this exception only if the participant transferred to the certifying institution from an institution that sponsors bowl subdivision football and has two or more seasons of competition remaining in football or the participant transfers from a Football Championship Subdivision institution that offers athletically related financial aid in football to a Football Championship Subdivision institution that does not offer athletically related financial aid in football;”

So under (a) you cannot be a participant in bowl subdivision football or any other major. Without 14.1.9.1 trumping, I don't see how anyone who had ever played baseball, basketball, bowl division football or ice hockey could play anywhere else. Anyone seeing something here I am not?

(b) is a no previous transfer rule. No problem there. This was Masoli's first transfer.

“(c)	 The student is in good academic standing and meets the progress-toward-degree requirements. The transferring student must be one who would have been academically eligible had he or she remained at the institution from which the student transferred, and he or she also must be eligible at the certifying institution as a regularly enrolled, full-time, degree-seeking student who was admitted in accordance with the regular, published entrance requirements of the institution. The student shall not be required to fulfill the necessary percentage-of-degree requirements at the previous institution; and (Revised: 1/10/95, 1/9/96) ”
(c) only speaks to academic eligibility if he or she had remained. NOT eligibility as a player. It funny that the explanation the NCAA gave (The student must have been in good academic standing and eligible to compete had he or she decided to remain at the previous institution.) imply you have to be eligle as a player. BUT that is not in the actual code, only in the fluff.

(d) says the the transferring school has to give the waiver. Again no problem there. As a matter of fact there is an appeal process if the transferring school does not give a waiver. So, if he had no eligibility as a player for some real reason, it would seem Oregon would be bound to object or not give a waiver under the NCAA's code of conduct. Instead Oregon gave the waiver.   
So where are we? Hell if I know. But anything from the NCAA that says he had to be eligible as a player is bullshit. They got 444 pages of rules. I'm still looking through them, but I think Ole Miss has got a hell of a case.

**tl/dr** The NCAA makes up shit as they go along. Masoli and Ole Miss are getting screwed.","1283304344"

It's easy to get there with headphones though, there being a quality level where you can easily pick apart different sounds. You can get a really good headphone setup for $500.

Once you have a nice playback system it's really a matter of preference, I have several hundred, probably around a thousand really, vinyl records. I stopped listening to them several years ago because they're simply too inconvenient, my active sound library is now over 2000 songs deep, and those are hand picked songs, usually the best track from a release. To maintain that library in vinyl I'd need a special room, with some kind of cross referencing system and it'd take me more time to setup my listening for the day than it would to actually listen, not to mention the maintenance needed to care for vinyl.

I'm a big fan of the live sound too, I've worked many years in high end live audio reinforcement, with bands like jack johnson, death cab, etc and djs like bassnectar and a lot of the burning man scene. My favorite thing in the world is a low distortion, full range(proper response all the way from down low to up high), high power system and I can still listen to shitty mp3s all day long at work with a headphone amp and hd600s.

Cocktails at your place was a great idea, it involves your place and alcohol and her accepting which is pretty much the sex equivalent of leaving a can of petrol, a matchbox and a troubled teenager alone in an abandoned explosives factory.

You can very easily salvage this. Don't worry about all this kino crap. Obviously, make some drinks, sit down together somewhere close, after about 20-40 minutes (it can really be any time, don't stick to that like a manual!), at the appropriate lul in conversation look at her, kiss her, let things happen.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Great, thanks for reminding me of this.

So I walked in on my 14 year old brother and his best friend watching my Dads porn. Basically he was looking for a movie when he found this really dodgy 1970's cheesy porno in the back of my Dads movie cupboard. He comes running out saying ""gross, look what I found!"". Dad yelled at him saying stay the ""Fuck out of my cupboard"" but I don't think he cared to much.

Anyway a few days later he borrowed my xbox and wanted it back. So I went to his room and asked for it (at the door) and he told me to fuck off. In my 16 year old head I'm like fuck this, I bought it, I should be able to play it whenever I wanted. So I opened the door and they're both sitting on the end of his bed with a cushion over each of their crotches, with it freeze framed over some guys hairy fucking arse nailing some dirty 70's vag. (He obviously paused it but I've never had the courage to ask him) I said ""What the fuck are you...oh"" and walked out. Didn't look at him for a few days after that.

Haha writing this I just realized he borrowed my xbox to watch it, he didn't have a DVD player in his room. Fuck that, I still play with it. Not for much longer though.","1283304370"

So what?  The fact that they don't vote Repub 100.00% of the time does not mean that the movement is not tilted to one party:   11x more identify as Repub than Dem.  For every TP that says he's a Dem, there are **11** that say they are Repubs.    That's a *huge* difference, and it makes it very hard to claim that the movement is not partisan.

"reddit.com","t5_6","When the farmers purchase the seed, they sign a contract that says they will not reuse the seed.  This is how monsanto is able to sell the seed to the farmers at a reasonable price, with yearly returns.

In the case you, and Food, Inc., discuss, the farmer was found to have 95-98% Monsanto Round Up Ready canola on his property.  The farmer had claimed accidental contamination, and more specifically that he was not infringing on Monsanto's patent because he did not apply the Round Up pesticide to that specific crop.

However, it was determined that the farmer identified and willfully replanted ROR canola in his fields based on survival of specific canola plants after spraying with Round Up.  Though the farmer claimed it was a miscommunication with his farm-hand, that does not excuse willful violation of a companies intellectual property.

So, while the initial ROR plants may have accidentally arrived on the farm, it was found that contamination to the tune of 95-98% ROR crop was impossible.  The court then found that the farmer had either willfully identified and replanted ROR canola, which constituted an infringement on Monsanto's patents.

You should be aware that documentaries, such as Food, Inc., tend to slant things in their favor.

I had a similar issue.  She relied on me for everything. After years, I sat her down and gave her a speech. I told her everything. It was tearful and difficult for both of us.  At the end I said ""I don't think we can recover from this. In 60 days, I'm leaving."" 

it was, well, difficult. But the reality set in ... in 60 days I was gone and she was going to have to figure out what to do. During this time we still talked and supported each other emotionally. I wasn't angry at her. She was not angry at me. We just agreed that life wasn't what I wanted it to be, and I couldn't take it any more. 

Guess what? in less-than-60 days she got a plan together. I mean, she had to, she had no choice, really.  

that's how I handled it. you could handle it a slightly different way, if you wanted. Save up some cash and give it to her. or offer her that plane ticket after you tell her it's over. Say you'll pay for rent for one month but after that it's over. etc.

You can for example use OOCSS' (arbitrary left and right columns) template and create variations thereof for different scaling/footer-positioning behavior. So, getting the rough layout up and running will take you only a minute.

You could also create different kinds of menus and write a step by step guide (for yourself) which covers the required skinning steps. Once your steps are clear enough there will be no need for testing - it will just work.

A reset and default styles for the default stuff will surely help. Also, take a look at the OOCSS concepts. This should help.

Grids will be also useful. The CMS should be able to deal with them efficiently.

Speaking of which, setting up the CMS should be fully automated. Same thing goes for backups. And of course there should be some sort of update strategy. Ideally, the work should be only done once.

You'll also need very efficient issue tracking and task scheduling.

Also, there should be well defined limits for everything in those contracts.

So, basically... it's all about recycling and optimization. Every page is pretty much the same, they only look different. Heh. Of course you can just do all of that with hard work, but it will grind you into pieces within one year.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","As someone who's experienced it from both ends (bisexual guy) let me try and explain it. 

For the receptive partner (leaving aside prostate stimulation), the anus is remarkably sensitive to different types of stimulation. It isn't a sensation that everyone enjoys, but it is remarkably intense and pleasurable for a lot of people. If you want to see if you might enjoy it, I recommend not leaping straight in to attempting penetration; there's so much more to anal play than this- next time you're masturbating or having sex, try just circling the anus lightly with a wet finger tip, and see if the sensation is agreeable. If it is, imagine that feeling magnified many, many times over and you're getting there. It's also (so my partner tells me) an orgasm that's very different from clitoral or g-spot orgasms, so it's worth trying just to see if you can get to that, imho.

For the penetrative partner, it's also a very different sensation from vaginal intercourse- it's tighter, and squeezes in very different patterns, which your man may or may not find pleasurable. 

For both of you, I think a lot of the thrill comes from doing something that's a bit more naughty, more dirty, perhaps even taboo, than what you might otherwise do. But that won't happen if you're apprehensive/only doing it to please the other while not enjoying it yourself. 

General advice: Don't get hung up on penetration as the only kind of anal play- manual stimulation, rimming, even just a warm breath on it can feel sensational, especially when combined with stimulation of other parts of you. Remember that you've both got an anus, too, so it's something you can share together. When (if) you do get to penetration, you want be totally relaxed and feel ready. If you think it's going to hurt, then it most likely will. Use lots of lube (water or better yet, silicone based) and start with something small- going very, very slowly. Don't be in a rush- really take your time together and enjoy exploring these new sensations together. Make sure that if you say stop, he's prepared to stop and not start again until you're ready. Communicate, trust, relax, enjoy.

Hope that helps!","1283304438"

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","For anyone reading that is a Seattleite: Go rent the original ""Night Stalker"" movie, the one with Darren McGavin chasing vampires around in Seattle.  It's from about 1974 or so, and features an extended sequence in the, uh, ""Underground Seattle"" as only Hollywood could imagine it: Completely preserved buildings, rooms, elegant ballrooms with place settings still intact, streets, and all the other amenities of living in a city... with working electricity and plumbing even!  

For all you non-Seattleites: ""Underground Seattle"" is a mish-mash of abandoned and derelict basements that are below street level, full of garbage, rats, and discarded furniture.  A local entrepreneur noticed that all the garbage and discarded furniture dates back to the early days of Seattle, and so created a tourist destination out of it.  To be fair, the tour guides make the whole thing worthwhile, as the stories they tell while you are trekking through dingy, dirty, crap-filled basements makes it all far more interesting than it would seem.

Anyway... reading about how Hollywood gets Seattle wrong always reminds me of that movie, and the wildly unbelievable Seattle Underground scenes.  ","1283304460"

At least, that's what I try to think on my more optimistic days.

The second is the depression that you're struggling with. It sounds like you're taking action on this by seeing a psychiatrist. Fun with chemicals can be rather miserable, but until the right combination of talk and pills is found (I have no idea what that is), the only thing to do is to keep trying. You're very brave in trying to confront this head on.

The third is the drama with your landlord. It sounds like you can get the contract from your ex before the end of the month (assuming you mean end of Sept). Once you get a copy of the contract, you should be able to find a legal aid clinic to help you know your rights - this really tends to change from state to state/country to country.

No - there's no reason to believe you can't do it. Trail running and road running are very different animals and some discomfort after a run on the road is to be expected if you're generally accustomed to trail running. Someone who went from running on the road to a 10 mile run on a trail would also be in more pain than usual afterwards. A marathon in late-November might be a little aggressive if your miles per week is 30 right now and it's only been building to that level now.

I think the more important question is whether you want to run this marathon in November. If you don't enjoy road running and prefer trail running - why not just run on trails?

I think people put too much emphasis on certain distances and certain types of events. People should just do what they enjoy the most and screw the other noise.

I have enough cash to pay the annual out-of-pocket maximum on my health insurance.

&gt;Personally, I think you should keep your accounts open and actually use them because what you're doing right now is simply a workaround- you're not solving the root problem.

I don't follow. What is the root problem and why is not going into debt a workaround? If it is, why is that bad?

&gt;Downvote me if you want

Never! I downvote trolls. Everyone here has pretty much engaged in thoughtful discussion. In fact, have an upvote.

&gt;To answer your question, it is better to have inactive accounts than to close them. Closing them reduces your debt to available credit ratio.

How much would it drive it down? I have heard that you can get to 0 in a year by not having any credit (or open accounts). A 0 is better than a ""bad"" score, but I don't think this is an option for me because of my mortgage. So are we talking about driving it down to the ""no credit"" bracket or just the ""really bad"" bracket? I was hoping there would be someone around here with only a mortgage that would be able to relate their experience.

Maybe it was the hot shower I was taking or maybe it's because I'm very unfit but suddenly during the process I started feeling very lightheaded. I quickly stopped and got out of the shower, I felt like getting sick and my light headedness was getting worse to the point I felt like fainting.. I ran into my room soaking wet and lied there naked whilst packing a semi on my bed like a pathetic fuck. I eventually regained normality..but to this day I do not attempt to jack off in the shower ever again...

There is even a semi-nearly-quasi-marriage setup of being able to ""register"" your relationship there which means there is official paperwork supporting your access to de facto benefits etc. but marriage itself will need to be legislated at the federal level.

However, it's still a big opinion that they're 'very good,' especially if you've never actually used one. 

I'm not sure what to suggest; if you weren't aware they made laptops at all, that could be a  TIL, but I guess it changes it if you knew about them already but just figured they sucked...

If there's something that is quantitative, like ""TIL that Samsung makes high-performance laptops,"" that is acceptable. Otherwise, if it's a judge of quality, that's up to other people.

Is this a high-performance laptop? Anyway, something like that, I think, could work. But, if it seems like you're just telling people Samsung's laptops are very good, then that seems like an opinion, (even if you're approaching it from a different angle than that.)

I haven't kept up with hardware enough to really make any judgments at all about the specs, but, if those are good specs, then that's what should be mentioned.

The fact that they make *laptops* that probably don't suck is notable. The idea that they make *'very good'* laptops, is in the realm of opinion.

So, hopefully that's clearer now. Let me know if I can help.","1283304663"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Man, I don't even know. It's such a big question. The wonder I hold for the world around me comes naturally to me, and I'm not sure how to pump you up. 

When I read a book like ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" and learn about how so many different scientific disciplines point to the same understanding of how the natural world has evolved to be what it is today, I am blown away. Everything from dendrochronology (dating based on tree rings) to radiometric dating to the geological history of the planet to the fossil record to DNA to laboratory research. We have all these little ways of looking literally billions of years back through the history of our planet and we use these different perspectives to construct a comprehensive understanding of the world around us. Billions of years! Can you even begin to wrap your head around what a billion years is?! This amazes me.

When I read ""A Brief History of Time"" and learn about modern physics and how it eventually ties to the very extreme limits of our understanding of the physical world and the universe, I am staggered. Things like wave/particle duality and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle are absolutely wonderful discoveries that defy all rational logic, and yet they make perfect sense!

I can't wrap my head around your position. Everything about the world around me amazes me. Protein folding and the critical functions proteins fulfill in everything our body does amazes me. Life and the lengths it will go to to survive amazes me. This computer I am typing on and the incredible achievement that the modern transistor represents amazes me. Human awareness amazes me. Hell, *pavement* amazes me. We are the only animal on earth to have ever taken our understanding of the world so far that we can make *pavement*. We *fly*. We *travel thousands of feet below the surface of the ocean*. We drill miles and miles into the earth to harvest oil formed over *millions of years*. We fucking *go to space*. We are *incredible*.

Go watch the Life documentary and the Planet Earth documentary, both narrated by David Attenborough. Read the two books I just mentioned. You will learn things about the natural world that will blow your mind. When somethings comes out that you don't understand, research it. Ask us on here. Don't ask us to fuel your sense of wonder, open your eyes and look around you. Find that sense of wonder for yourself!","1283304672"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","OK, so.

Do practice tests. Focus on the easy practice, because the hard practice is, well, way harder than the RA exam (I'm a certified L1 and the hard practice still throws me for a loop every once in a while; again, it's *hard* and it's supposed to be). Look up stuff you don't know, but don't fret too much over memorizing exact wordings of rules; what's important is that you understand the rules and can apply them sensibly.

Don't worry about things like the infraction guide, since it doesn't apply to Regular REL anymore and if you find yourself at a Competitive event there'll hopefully be a certified judge around.

Exam aside (since talking about specific details is off-limits), focus on the areas that are likely to actually come up in real games at your local shop. In my experience that includes:

* Priority and the stack. Lots of players don't really get how this stuff works, but there are common cases where it's important (e.g., ""why can't I bolt his Jace before he puts the counters on it from its +2"").
* Combat mechanics. A huge number of things players get confused about ultimately come down to knowing the steps within the combat phase and what happens in each step. Knowing how trample affects the damage-assignment rules is also important, as is the M11 change to trample + deathtouch.
* The difference between activated and triggered abilities, and why the answer to ""can I name Lotus Cobra with Pithing Needle"" is ""yes"" even though it's not the answer the player wants.
* How protection works. The DEBT mnemonic (Damage, Enchanting/Equipping, Blocking, Targeting) is helpful here, because you'll get a lot of people asking why Day of Judgment kills Malakir Bloodwitch and such.
* Layers. [This](http://mtgsalvation.com/836-cranial-insertion-order-of-operations.html) is a great article introducing the basics, and you will end up getting asked about this sooner or later (especially with Diminish in M11, where ""Diminish in response to Giant Growth"" usually doesn't do what the Diminish player wants).
* The remedies outlined in [the FCE](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/doccenter/home), which is the new Regular-REL guide now that the IPG doesn't apply there anymore. Most of it's common sense because it was designed for shops that don't have actual judges (i.e., the vast majority of them).

If you can get that stuff down I think you'll be in pretty good shape; RA is largely about being able to handle and answer these kinds of common situations, not necessarily about having encyclopedic knowledge of every part of the rules.

Also, if you know how to use IRC, pop into `#mtgjudge` on efnet; it's a great resource for talking to people who've been there and want to help you get there too.","1283304677"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It doesn't do a whole lot of good to say that the universe is actually a perfect simulation of a universe because there's no way to falsify that. There's no way to prove that the universe isn't a simulation which makes it a moot point. There's also no way to prove that you aren't a brain in a jar hooked up to simulate the world around you, and that this message is part of that simulation.

But because there's no way to disprove it, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. If someone claims that we are living in a world that is a computer simulation they need to back that up with evidence. And evidence means something that other people can reproduce - not anecdotes.

Personally, I believe that there is a lot beyond our understanding, but to say that everything beyond our understanding is some sort of conscious being (a ""programmer"") is counter-productive. At that point, the world gets put into two divisions: things that we currently know and things that are attributed to the programmer. It's also a big leap to move from ""there are things we don't understand"" to ""those things are caused by a being with *reason*.""","1283304685"

"science","t5_mouw","I've talked to a bunch of my friends at med schools around the country, and they were shocked at the idea that it happens because it is a clear violation of ethical guidelines and comprises patient's informed consent, and professionalism/ethics is one of the points that my school really hammers into us.  But I was very surprised when they asked me to do a pelvic exam on an anesthetized patient on the first day of my Ob/Gyn rotation.  I admit having done it simply because I was ordered to do it by my attending, and I didn't have the balls to refuse.  Looking back though I feel terrible about it, and if I was a more seasoned medical student who wasn't shit-scared of the higher-ups, I would've done differently.

BUT these were only done in the setting of Ob/Gyn procedures.  I think you ladies can rest assured that medical students won't be anywhere near your vagina if you're having an appendectomy or something.  For surgeons, there is no reason or motivation at all to tell a surgery student to do a pelvic exam - Ob/Gyns deal with and will teach about the female parts whereas other surgeons would be hard-pressed to give two shits about showing a student how to manipulate the uterus.

I think schools that do this have poor teaching faculty in their Ob/Gyn programs.  Rather than take the time and effort to teach us how to be compassionate and sensitive when dealing with a female patient in their most exposed and vulnerable state, they'd rather us just probe around someone who's asleep so that they don't have to deal with the awkwardness of asking someone ""excuse me, mind if a student fingers your vajayjay for a bit today?""  That was the case in my school.  I didn't get to do a pelvic exam on a real patient until my last day of the rotation, and that's because I worked with a faculty member who was willing to teach me how to do it properly, and she had a good relationship with her patient so that it wasn't as awkward to ask to let me examine her.  I only regret not working with her earlier so that I would've gotten a better learning experience out of my rotation.","1283304686"

He urged us to drop whatever pre-conceptions and beliefs we had about Christianity and just focus on what Jesus was trying to teach through his sayings.

The problem with most Christians is that they are not really reading the book. The book is just an a reference they use to reinforce  their belief system and it's often quoted out of context.  If you look at Q and read up on scholars who are doing research on  the saying of Jesus, their conclusion is radically different than what most people know as Christianity.","1283304709"

There are plenty of sources for science content on the Web. You could be learning science right now, rather than asking for ""scientific proof"".

Most of the time they'll be completely understanding and go ahead and reverse the charge rather than risking it being charged back.  

If they do not, just simply ask if they have any signature (most hotels are paperless).  If they don't, then you're in luck.  Then, if, and only if, your friend's card was not swiped, she can dispute the charge. The hotel will have no proof for fighting it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Let me put it this way....you didn't say anything which addressed the point. This led me to conclude that you didn't get it.

I did, I just didn't spell it out.  I figured that the connection would be made.  My mistake.

&gt; No, convicts have done ILEGAL stuff, which is not the same thing.
&gt; You yourself are a pot smoker, or used to be, and could easily find yourself a convict.

Granted, but we're dealing with imperfect information given by the original poster, who has implied that it is actual bad stuff as opposed to harmless pot smoking. 

&gt; Sure, it's evidence they may be not be a good person...nobody is disputing that. The problem is it's not terribly strong evidence.

Yes, being a convict is evidence that they may not be a good person.  People have to deal with imperfect information all the time, and its reasonable to lower trust based on imperfect information.  The fact that he is a convict is actually relevant to the discussion because its a discussion about the guy staying in his sister's house.

&gt; This is silly as that's not the real issue at all....the issue he is a bad person.

Except that you don't know he's a bad person, except based on the original poster's word.  You don't know that the guy in my story is a bad person except that you implicitly trust that my telling of the events is accurate.  Likewise, I don't know for sure that a convict is a bad person, but I work with the information I have.

&gt; A convict is simply someone who allegedly broke the law, and was found guilty. It in itself says almost nothing about the type of person they are.

It may or it may not.  Again, information is imperfect.  I was careful to say that it *suggests* that the person is not a good person.  This applies to almost anything though.  Some very bad people actually act very good.  All you can do is work with what information you have.

&gt; If you know what they are convicted of, that says a bit more...but even still. There are plenty of former purse snatchers who are now a better person than you.

Yes, I don't doubt that, but that doesn't mean that I should treat a purse snatcher that just got out of jail as if he's completely reformed.  You take umbrage at the fact that the conviction is brought up, despite it being relevant evidence suggesting that the person may have a sordid past.  All I'm saying is that its relevant and should be weighed.  Perhaps not heavily, perhaps in light of other evidence, but its not meaningless information.

&gt; Again, evidence that you miss the point. Nobody is saying you should.

Except that you're saying that I shouldn't make assumptions based on a conviction, which is implying that I should. 

&gt; All I said was the mere fact of being a convict is not reason for revoking trust.

Trust isn't a binary switch.  If the person explains that they were put in for pot, fair enough, its back up to 100%.  If he was a purse snatcher but honestly wants to turn a new leaf, then maybe I'll associate with him but not leave him alone in my house.

&gt; It is VERY relevent to the discussion...because in that case they would be the SAME person....but NOT a convict.

No, its not relevant because the poster told us he's a convict, and our discussion is about whether being a convict is useful information.  Its not relevant to wonder about whether he would still be a bad person if he wasn't a convict. 

&gt; You've admitted my point: that the problem is not really that they are a convict....it's that they are a bad person.

I don't recall disagreeing with your point in the first place.  My point is that the conviction is relevant information that suggests that they may be a bad person, and thus that its relevant to point it out.  Even in my story, and the OP's, you don't know that the people actually are bad.  You are using imperfect evidence to arrive at a personal conclusion.

&gt; Being a convict can be indicative of being a bad person, but it is nowhere close to anything approaching conclusive.

I never said it was conclusive.  Quite the contrary, I went out of my way to stress that it isn't conclusive.  My argument its valid to be more careful about people with convictions.

&gt; This is a pretty simple concept, and I don't know why you can't just admit you were perhaps wrong in your phrasing and clarify....

I always admit I am wrong when someone convinces me that I am.  Perhaps your phrasing is not as air-tight as you seem to think it is?

&gt; of course from your posts you seem quite the arrogant little 20 year old who hasn't moved out yet....so that may be why.

So, a personal attack then?  I wonder what led you to assume that I haven't moved out yet.  I haven't lived with my family for a decade.  You're off of your age assessment by roughly the same amount too.

Again, just because I don't agree with you doesn't make me arrogant.  You're the one berating me for repeatedly ""missing the point,"" which is more arrogant than anything I've stated.

&gt; ...and it has nothing to do with what we're talking about. It's a straw man.

I will admit that I botched this here.  You were, indeed, not arguing that someone's word should be taken on trustworthiness.

&gt; Nobody said you have to take someone's word....in fact that's the whole point. You should judge people based on all the information you have about them....not one simple fact like at some point they were convicted of a crime.

Being convicted of a crime is one point of data.  If its your only point of data, then full mistrust is probably not warranted, but neither is full trust.  That's my point.  Your original post seemed to be distraught at the fact that the conviction was being discussed at all.

&gt; There is a lot of discrimination against convicts, and you don't realize how easy it is to become one, because you haven't been out into the real world (through no fault of your own).

What do you mean?  I'm out in the real world right now.  I have been out for a while.  I'm married, have a job, have my own place.  I live half a continent away from my closest relative.

You're also being incredibly presumptuous by claiming that I don't understand about discrimination against convicts.  This discrimination is actually a huge pet peeve of mine, and I imagine you and I could actually have quite a long discussion on how fucked up it is that one conviction can basically ruin your life in unimaginable ways. 

&gt; You don't realize that you perpetuating the stereotype of ""all convicts are bad people"", actually hurts real people out there.

I'm not trying to.  In fact I was actively trying *not* to, which is why I used a lot of weasel words in my post.  I'm simply making the argument that its not entirely irrelevant to be more careful with people convicted of a crime.  Those convicted should still be allowed to re-integrate with society, hold down good jobs, and generally live their lives like any other person.  None of that is predicated on me, nor the OP, giving them 100% trust.

&gt; My friend wasn't the best example granted, but I brought him up specifically because it's why this hit close to home for me.

I sympathize with and understand your feelings for your friend.  Do you sympathize with my point of view of a person who's family trusted a convict as being, basically, a good person, and had that trust abused?

&gt; In order for my point to be made, I only need to show that one convict is not a bad person.

&gt; In order for yours to be made, you need to show that all are bad, or the vast majority is bad.

In order for my point to be made, I only need show that a conviction can serve as evidence that a reduced level of trust in a person is warranted.  Recidivism rates of convicts compared to first-time offenders would have been better, granted.  My anecdote is evidence, albeit anecdotal.  Yours was anecdotal too, so fair trade.

&gt; No, not what I said at all.

You said that you didn't like that the OP pointed out that he was a convict.  To me, that implies that it should be downplayed or not stated at all.

&gt; Nobody is saying caution isn't warranted.

OK, then what did you mean when you chided the OP for the conviction thing?  What did you mean when you chided me for using my story to suggest that its warranted to give convicts a reduced level of trust?  From my point of view, you certainly are stating that a conviction should not play into the overall picture.

&gt; You specifically made a big deal about the SINGLE FACT that he was a convict.

In my story?  I pointed out that the conviction was information that was overlooked when, in fact, it was relevant.  I don't see the OP making a big deal out of the single fact that he was a convict either.  Certainly, he implies that he knows the sordid details and has decided that the conviction warrants caution.  You have extrapolated to mean that I only cared about the single fact that he was a convict.  Obviously, I gave him the benefit of the doubt until he started pawing my stuff.

&gt; You said something like ""I can't let a CONVICT live in my house"".

No I said I wouldn't let a convict *live* in my house without first building up a *certain level of trustworthiness* that I afford to non-convicts.

&gt; Imagine if you had said BLACK PERSON, instead of CONVICT, and you can see how your reasoning is flawed.

Being black isn't a choice, but nice try at trying to associate me with racists.  Being a convict isn't always a choice either, which is why I was careful not to throw around ultimatums, but in many cases it is.  This is why scrutiny and caution, but not outright dismissal, is warranted.

&gt; If it was true that all convicts are guilty, or that the guilty ones had all committed really bad crimes....you would have a leg to stand on.

I never said that all convicts are guilty, nor that all convicts were bad.  I said that being a convict warranted further caution and scrutiny until a certain level of trust is rebuilt. ","1283304762"

My take on this image is that the tail is swooping downward (relative to the nose). It's probably already really cold -- those rainbows are from ice crystals -- and wings sweeping downward through the air was just enough to freeze the water vapor in the air. This was probably a low-G maneuver.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; I have to take exception with this. While there may be an intrinsically random and unexplainable trigger underlying the spontaneous decay of radioactive nuclei, simply saying ""It's random because it's based on something random"" doesn't cut it as a scientific model. It may simply appear random because we don't yet have a good model.

I don't think the point I was making came across clearly, but suffice to say I didn't mean that my one paragraph is the entire story; there's a lot more to quantum theory that provides more background here.  I'm guessing I failed to address the real crux of your question due to not understanding it?

&gt; And no, statistics does not guarantee constant behavior of a system consisting of a large number of elements. A statistically constant behavior stems from an underlying order within the system, albeit one we may not understand.

Not sure I follow what you're saying here; I'm not a statistician, but I'm not familiar with the bit about ""underlying order"" as a part of statistics, as opposed to the law of large numbers which is.

&gt; So, let me rephrase my question in a way that may make my point clearer...
&gt; Clearly something about these two nuclei is dramatically impacting whatever the underlying source of randomness is. Do we have a good scientific model for at least this much?

Well, certainly the average decay time for a single atom of each of the two types mentioned is very different.  If one knows the mean lifetime of an atom then it's straightforward to calculate a half-life based on a simple equation.  As for actually determining the mean lifetime based on the atomic configuration, we do have models for this as well, ranging from the fairly simple down to actually modeling individual particle interactions with QCD (the latter is actually essentially impossible in practice due to the nonlinearity of the system and the difficulty of the calculations as a consequence; Nuclear physicists please come in and correct me here).

However, having said all that, the question could still be posed: ""why does a particular QCD calculation only give me the probability that a nucleus will decay in time X, instead of telling me exactly when it will decay?"", and again the answer is that QCD is a quantum theory, and the unpredictability is a fundamental part of the system.  It's not that we don't have a good enough understanding of what's going on; it's just not possible to ever predict what will happen.  This is due to the wave nature of quantum mechanics; if I showed you a a wave packet like [this](http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Graphics/Gaussian.gif) and asked you what the position of that wave is, obviously any answer you give will be incorrect, because the wave encompasses a range of possible positions.  In addition, in quantum mechanics, each wave also carries information about a conjugate variable in the form of its frequency (which you can get by doing a Fourier transform on it).  So, even if you were to compress the wave into a very narrow spike about some point so that its position becomes well-defined, the range of frequencies that make up that wave would increase.  Thus, as you make one variable (position) well-defined, its conjugate (in this case it would be the momentum) always becomes less well-defined, and the uncertainty principle always holds.  It's not because we don't have a good model, it's just a consequence of defining reality as being a wave.

So you see, my original answer was the same as this one, I just skipped a few steps in the middle...","1283304889"

http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/cqx6u/ok_why_is_there_so_much_anal_in_hetero_porn/

From the guy's point of view, it can be exciting because you're exploring new territory, and your girl is allowing something that is often seen as more intimate than regular sex. Physically, anal is typically tighter, providing more sensations for the guy. Personally, it can be really hot, if the girl enjoys it. It can also be a horrible experience if she is scared or in pain. Take the time to read more about it, so you know the risks, issues, benefits, and drawbacks. You might also want to try experimenting with toys, plugs, beads or fingers before going all the way. PS: Lube is your friend!

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","I recommend most guys replace ""neg"" with ""flirt"" or ""tease"". It's generally a healthier mindset and ""negging"" should be reserved for actually negging. It's very counter-productive, especially for someone just getting into this stuff, to confuse the concepts. 

When in doubt, don't even neg.

The only ""mandatory neg"" is to reveal to a girl that her attractiveness doesn't faze you. You do this by not being a chump, by flirting with confidence with energy derived from your will to have fun, not derived from her reactions. 

I find negs beyond this to be overkill for most girls. Unless a girl is in her Team Girlfran! posse dressed up for nightclub-hopping, most girls don't need to be actively disarmed (negged), especially when they're just milling around campus sweating in their over-sized sorority shirts and their Nike running shorts.","1283304940"

That is, it never updates a trace once it has compiled it, which dictates a strategy of allowing the trace to run for a while in the interpreter in order to have a reasonable chance of exploring all hot paths.

A better approach, which I'm evolving it towards, is to recompile the trace every time a new hot path is discovered.  This way, we can switch from the interpreter to the compiled trace very early, AND still be able to discover new hot paths as the execution continues.  The tricky part is in figuring out how to jump-start the recorder immediately after the side exit from a compiled trace.","1283304985"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","In short, yes. But a 3-foot steel box wouldn't work, you would need some kind of pressure creating chamber. (like a diamond press) To stop it from expanding. I wrote a pretty long discussion about this on a previous post, that I will repost here.  [Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bxdxu/what_happens_to_water_if_its_not_allowed_to/c0p2qbl?context=3)

""So let's start on the phase diagram [here](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/phase.html). For argument sake, let's start at STP about 0.1 Mpa (Megapascals) and 293K. Conveniently, there is a little E on the graph where that is. So we put our water in something that won't break or in chamber that will keep the volume of the water constant as we cool it. So, we start cooling it. When we hit 273 K we should see ice. However, we aren't letting the volume change so no ice will probably form. For a little while at least we will get super-cooled water. (A similar, though slightly different phenomenon can be observed when you place a soda in the freezer and pull it out just below freezing. It is liquid, when you open it, it depressurizes and the dissolved CO2 content lowers, because of this, it will freeze.)

At this point, it would like to freeze but it can't organize into ice with the amount of pressure it's under. (this isn't exactly true, but it will work) Now is when things get complicated. If we leave it at 250K until some normal ice forms, the normal ice will increase the pressure on the water that is not yet ice, as water is not very compressible (it will relieve some pressure by compressing and might actually compress enough to compensate for expanding ice, it is not clear. Still let's say water is incompressible). If the pressure gets up to 300 Mpa then the water will relieve some pressure with some [Ice III](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_iii.html), which is different from [normal ice](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice1h.html) and is more dense than the compressed water meaning it will relieve some pressure.

However, Ice III  does not have a really wide range of stability so even at those temperatures we could still get some [Ice V](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_v.html) if the temperature was between 253K-250K or if the pressure shot up faster than the Ice III could form. Ice V is even more dense, so even more pressure relieved. (Higher amount of normal ice to Ice V). Or if the temperature was above  253K but below freezing or the pressure shot up even faster, we could get [Ice VI](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_vi.html). However, this is unlikely as the 'energy'(It's actually kinda a drop in energy, I can explain more, but I'm a bit exhausted. Tell me if you want more explanation.) needed to generate those pressures is not generated very quickly or at high enough levels at such high temperatures.

So, let's say we cooled it way down by doing it very very slowly. If we got below 200K we could get [Ice II](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_ii.html). 

Basically, you will get a combination of normal ice and some other phase of ice. Which Ice you get will depend on temperature. As the pressure equilibrates, ice II or III is most likely, though V and VI aren't impossible just less likely. Also, I have been ignoring the fact that water can compress. It is entirely possible the pressure will not get high enough to form any of these ices and you will just get a two phase compressed water/ice combo. (This becomes less likely the colder you get the solution thus making Ice II the most likely if we assume water is somewhat compressible.)""","1283305004"

"HONORSBIOLOGY","t5_2s2em","In 2-2, some of the material I had already gone over in eighth grade, such as Acids, bases, Ph, and a little bit of solutions. The rest of it was new or i couldnt remember.  Polarity, the uneven distribution of electrons was new to me, but it helped since Mr. Newhams explained it in class. Hydrogen bonds when a negative oxygen of a water molecule attracts to a positve hydrogen of another molecule because the electrons spend most of their time on the oxygen side since there are more protons over there.But since Mr. Newhams went over it was alot simpler when i read it.  I thought cohesion and adhesion was interesting, how two molecules of thge same substance attract is cohesion, and two molecules of different substances attract is adhesion, such as water and a glass and how the water curves up to and sticks to the side.  Suspensions, when a nondissovable substance gets put with water, making a mixture was new, but easily understandable.  Buffers was also new and interesting.  Buffers are a weak acid or a base that react to strong acids and bases to keep the strong acids/bases from making too much of a rapid change.","1283305037"

I like that they're finally putting consumption on stickers though. MPG isn't as useful as GPM when you're comparing different efficiency options. For example, if you have two cars - one with 10mpg and one with 40mpg, replacing the 10mpg with an 11mpg car will save about twice as much gas than replacing the 40mpg car that gets 50mpg. It's not obvious when it's in MPG. In gal/1000 miles, you'd see that replacing a car that uses 100 gallons/1000 miles with one that uses 90 gallons saves more gas than replacing the car that uses 25 gal/1000 miles with one that uses 20 gallons.","1283305083"

I've been in this position before (honestly, I fall into this and come out semi-frequently) and I've seen many of my friends go through it, too. Every time it happens, I can always trace it to one thing: Me putting myself before God. What this means in practice is, me sleeping in fifteen minutes instead of waking up on time and reading my Bible to start the day. It means me coming home from work and watching TV or hopping on Reddit instead of praying and seeking Gods restoration. It means me haphazardly going about my day without thinking of the consequences of my actions and whether or not I'm furthering the Kingdom of God.

Check out the first chapter of 2 Peter. I read out of the NLT, and I saw some pretty cool stuff there today that really caught my eye. Peter says that God has given us everything we need to live a godly life, but we have to receive it by coming to know Him. God has given us promises that allow us to live without corruption and share in His divine nature, but we're instructed to make every effort to respond to these promises.

We have to remember that God comes first in all aspects of our lives. God doesn't want two hours per week or 10% of our income. God wants *all* of us. The caveat is we absolutely cannot do it alone. We cannot love God more than ourselves on our own, and God knows this. That's why Jesus died on the cross, and that takes us back to 2 Peter. God has given us everything we need to love Him. We need His help, and He wants to help. He'll change our desires if we want Him to, if we ask Him to. And I don't think it happens overnight. Baby steps, my brother.

And please don't think I'm preaching to you or coming down on you, because much of this is directed at myself, too. I hope it helps both of us.","1283305088"

I don't think it's a good idea to try to be someone you're not. Even for your family. Find people who will support you no matter what, and then work to find who you are. Sometimes everyone messes up.

And for the record, Catholicism is not anti-gay, it's just anti-gay acts. So since you're just same-sex attracted, but you haven't done anything about it, you should be a-ok in the eyes of God. Well, I guess not with the masturbating, but everyone has that problem. ","1283305089"

"politics","t5_2cneq","You asked my definition of racism. It does vary from place to place and some restrict it to those in power against those they subjugate. For me this is too narrow and puts the burden today on white people. For me it's wider than that. It's any irrational fear, dislike or hatred of a group of people who you consider another race. So that's a black guy who hate white people, A white guy who thinks Mexicans are out to rob him, an Asian who thinks all black are thieves. Just negative thoughts due to race for me is racism.

Me and my girlfriend just got back from holiday. We went to Spain to a resort. It's a pretty pricey holiday but it's the sort mostly working class English people go on with their families. When I say working class I mean it in the most traditional sense (in recent times in the UK it's come to mean anyone who earns a quite low wage or doesn't work at all, which makes little sense) but I mean people earning well above the UK median but doing what the educated classes would count as unskilled manual jobs. A good plumber can earn way more than a lawyer just starting out but that doesn't change the social standing of the man.

Now these people spent the entire week staring at me and my girlfriend. As it turns out holidays to Spain just isn't something many black people do. Now the best known sort of racism is one where these people feel we are inferior to them, probably likely to steal from them too. What we experienced was a sort of resentment. We were a young couple who could afford to be out near where Michelle Obama took her holiday. We talked properly with what people call the ""BBC"" accent. Several times I was asked what I did and saw raised eyebrows as I revealed I was a software developer and my girlfriend was studying anthropology. It's sort of the resentment Obama gets...like he's ""better"" than some poor white because he used unfair schemes designed to get blacks degrees they should not have gotten. It's a strange reverse of the old ""I'm better than you"" racism. That's what I most often face.","1283305091"

I know that's a stretch, and I'm not trying to make light of *forced* rape, but there is a thing called [rape by deception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_deception). The male has consented to vaginal intercourse with the use of contraceptives. If the female goes off of birth control, she is changing the details that the consent is contingent upon.

If he would not consent to sexual intercourse without the use of some form of contraceptive, and she withheld this information from him knowing that, she has violated the terms of the consent, and the consent is invalid.

I don't see this interpretation as unfair, misogynist, or one-sided. I think if a man lied about putting on a condom or having a vasectomy, the situation would be the same; he misled her about details that her consent to the act was contingent upon.","1283305093"

Over the course of a couple days, I figured out she was extremely depressed and suicidal.  She said she was planning on killing herself that night.  She told me what her plan was.  Just for anyone who doesn't know, if a person tells you they're thinking of killing themselves and they have a plan and a time, it's very very serious.  Get them help right away.

I wasn't sure what to do, so I contacted the police in her town.  I didn't know much about her, just her first name.  The police managed to track her through myspace and arrived at her house in the middle of the night.  They talked to her and she told them she had been thinking of killing herself.  The police kept in contact with me regarding their progress.  The police were really cool in this situation, not overbearing and they were very respectful to her.  They 5150ed (72 hour psych hold) her.  She had the police call me to let me know what was happening.  She got out the next morning.  They got her into an intensive outpatient treatment program that last 3 months.  She came to my birthday party a couple weeks later and I met her in person for the first time.

It's two years later now and she's doing pretty good.  She's still in therapy and takes medication.  Got a good job and is hoping to move out on her own soon.

We were new to the game and it was her first time playing, so we didn't do so great, dying in wave 2. One of the guys says ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING WATCH YOURSELF!!"" I told him to back off and she and I talked about how obnoxious it is when people who devote all their time to a particular game expect the same from random strangers and get pissed at them.


Cut to a few months later, my gf is a rebirthed level 50 in Bioshock 2, and she will RAGE when her team loses. Doesn't matter if she got 30+ kills and totally crushed everyone she came in contact with if the team lost overall. It really bothers me when she goes so far as to message someone who didn't know which way to go and get in their face about not knowing the maps like the back of their hand.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Amusing that I get flamed by the majority of the community, I thought Reddit would be different. Even the Bluelight or Shroomery community would not give me this much of an attitude.

First off, that was not my personal opinion, I would have said IMO. He has already told me that it's his belief he'll be dead before he's 23 if he continues his destructive habits.

The drug binge was not his daily routine, but after having been thrown out of his last rehab for acquiring meth with three other members, his parents left him on the street. Regardless of how the drugs cancel each other out, I witnessed the events first hand. I have even taken photos on two occasions which I have readily available.

Your logic is flawed; Why would I ask for legitimate advice? If I wanted payback, I would snitch, there's no need for some ego comfort by posting a topic asking if it's appropriate. That's irrational. This is a legitimate concern that I thought I would ask the community about. Apparently that was a mistake.

Building the architecture to do that is pretty time consuming... it's on the wishlist, but I'm not sure how soon it will happen... especially because to sync across computers, you really have to do it 1 of 2 ways:

1) Export some kind of text / settings file that you then need to send to the other computer and import...

2) Sync to a centralized server... so... who hosts that server?  Oh yeah... me :-)   I do have a place to put it, but... again... it's work.. it will require a lot of programming, and a bit of extra care for security reasons, etc...

So.. yes it's possible... but especially since, in my mind, option #2 is the only one that's attractive, it probably won't happen unless people are willing to pay some modest fee to help me pay for server costs...  It could be really small.. maybe $15/year or something... I dunno... but there needs to be sufficient level of interest from users that it's worth my while to maintain...

&gt; The story goes back to 2007 when Sara Wainberg was a medical student at McMaster University. Her younger brother Daniel, also studying to be a doctor, phoned for advice: As part of his rotation in obstetrics and gynecology, he had been asked to perform a pelvic exam on a woman who was under anesthetic. He refused, saying doing so without consent would be unethical.

The most interesting variations of Spanish, IMHO, are the [Argentinian Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina#Language) and the [Peruvian Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruvian_Coast_Spanish).

Argentinian Spanish sounds almost Italian. Peruvian Spanish sounds almost Quechua.

Sarcasm and irony were always lost on most Americans.

Sarcasm is a *tone* that is *applied* which reverses the meaning of *any* sentence.  A sentence itself cannot be intrinsically sarcastic - only its delivery.

And sarcasm in text is known to be problematic, at best.  There is no such thing as sarcasm without the audible aspect of a sentence, so people either directly hear the sarcastic tone in spoken language, or recognise its necessity and apply it themselves in the case of text.  Which is why it so often falls flat without a ""/s"" tag.

So saying ""oh, it's just sarcasm"" doesn't cut it - that's been retro-fitted to suit the situation, because plain factual reversal is not sarcasm.

Sure, you could say (using tone to apply the actual sarcasm) something like ""*Oh*, you are *so* old"" to a youngster, where the emphasis on ""so"" creates the sarcasm.

But if that kid turns back and says, ""No, *you* are so old"", that same phrase has no sarcasm.  Compare it to saying ""you're not so old"".  Completely opposite.

tl;dr lame excuse *retrofitted* to justify the fact that Americans' usage of the phrase is wrong, has always been that way, and that's just the way they like it.  I don't know why Americans insist on making up myriad justifications for this little evolutionary mis-step in the American English language - you've done worse, proudly.

When you string words together, a meaning exists that is immutable.  Leaving out the word NOT always simply reverses the meaning - it's not sarcasm!","1283305221"

If I were you, I would also say something along the lines of: My homosexuality is not the problem. In most of the western world today, it is not such a problem as you are making it out to be. The problem is your interpretation of your religion. Plenty of faithful people do not think homosexuals are sinful or evil or anything because everything that Jesus taught about loving and accepting people, helping those who society casts out, etc., runs contrary to whatever hateful things the old testament preaches about homosexuals. You can make the choice to interpret the bible in such a way that you will not have to demonize and discard your own child, or you can continue to choose an outdated and bigoted interpretation. If you choose the latter, I will have nothing more to do with either of you, and that is final.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;OK, so how do any of the setups you have defined describe the relationship between me and the individuals that call themselves the government?

The government collects taxes for the provision of services. Their sliding scale for the collection of these fees is publicly available, as well as the services the government provides. There are entire offices dedicated to answering your questions about what services the government provides. In fact, children are taught from a very young age some of these services, and instructed where to find out more of them. This constitutes the offer and the exchange of goods (services for taxation money).

Furthermore, throughout your life you receive these government services, from municipal water to worker's compensation mandates to welfare insurance to having your fees covered if you need to be represented in court to security, and so on and so forth. These are given at birth if you are born a citizen, or from the moment you step on American soil. At some point after you have received these services and been educated about them, as is known to everyone who has been educated about them, you are expected to pay taxes on your income to the service provider for these services.

Continuation of the receipt of these services by whatever means you can receive them, coupled with your knowledge of the payment schema for these services, constitutes consent to the contract by the same logic that allows you to get coffee and food in a restaurant without having to sign on a dotted line beforehand.
&gt;So when I say ""prove that I am bound by these implicit terms"" and you say ""if you sing a contract you are bound"" that is not an answer. Whenever you were asked specific questions you always referred to explicit signed contracts for your examples.

Yes, but not to the fact that they were signed. That's what makes it an explicit contract. When you asked specific questions, I answered them by showing you it was legitimate in other contracts, and asked you why it wasn't legitimate for this particular one. The fact that the examples were signed contracts isn't particularly relevant.","1283305247"

If this were the case then anyone could really just go around demanding money from anyone on the basis of anything and claim that since they did nothing they agreed. I doubt even government courts would recognize this as valid.

None of the elements of a binding contract is present in a social contract. There is no meeting of the minds. There is no offer or acceptance. There is not necessarily an exchange of value. And performance or delivery by the state is entirely at their discretion, they need not provide anything, yet they will still demand that you pay taxes. Also there is really no evidence anywhere that taxes are in fact an exchange for services. There are a lot of people that have this opinion, but I have yet to see any evidence.

Also I could argue that social contracts violate public policy, since I doubt the state would agree that my software consulting social contract was valid.","1283305269"

OK dude, let me extent some sympathy in that I understand that it's hard to hurt your family if you are close, whether or not you think you are in the right. For me, it was leaving Christianity. I don't even think it's my place to tell you ""you're not allowed to care about your parents expectations more than your desires"" or some such. Your priorities are your priorities, but if that's what you are planning on right now, instead of telling you what to do or what's right and wrong, let me try and extend some warning about how things might go.

Lot's of gay men try to ""become straight"" and it never seems to work out in the long run. It's not something you can change that easily. Feel free to do some research. Furthermore, I think you should really reconsider trying to make yourself like girls, because that's not just about you and your desires. It will eventually be about a girl. If you get into a long term relationship and in the end don't feel right about being straight, you could do some severe emotional damage to her.

You're 16 now, and you live at home. There's no rule that says you have to have a girlfriend/boyfriend right now or that you have to within the next few years. Don't go hurting some poor girl by using her to reassure yourself. Making a decision while you are still under your parents like this is not conducive to making a sound decision. If you can help it, try not to set yourself up for a post-high school life that is extra financially dependent on your parents.

And finally, I am currently living in an apartment with my very openly atheist girlfriend, and renounced Christianity myself about 4 years ago now. I still am close with my pentecostal parents and talk to them regularly and civilly. If they are good parents they will understand you don't want to hurt them and they will love you anyway. If not, I hope you can eventually find someone who doesn't love you just because you do what they want.

Good luck, and don't make any rash decisions.","1283305294"

http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/amznp/where_is_the_strangest_place_you_have_masturbated/c0if95t

&gt; I was a thirteen-year-old boy and still in the honeymoon phase of masturbation. The things I did to my penis would qualify as domestic abuse in some states. I wanted to try it everywhere, in every position, with every inspiration imaginable. I even masturbated to an illustrated Bible once but that's not the point of this story.

&gt; My dad is a crafty handyman type guy, and growing up we had an aboveground pool, a trampoline, and a handbuilt jungle gym/swingset type of apparatus. I'd already done the pool, trampoline, and swings, and tonight was the jungle gym's turn.
I started off in my room with the trusty JC Penney catalog and a bottle of conditioner. After an hour or so of foreplay - I was thirteen, and we did that then - I slipped out of the house naked, erect, and lubricated, and ran furtively up to the jungle gym.
It was raining slightly but still warm enough to be naked outside. It turns me the hell on to be naked in the rain, but that too is another story. The jungle gym is about thirty feet off the path that leads up to our barn, and I ran across the wet lawn and climbed on.
I experimented with several different positions before I found the one I wanted: hanging upside down by my knees from a pull-up bar. Simple, but effective. It was a bit uncomfortable on my knees, but bold experimenters must be prepared to endure mild hardship.

&gt; So there I was, upside down and enthusiastically going great guns, when the house door opens and my dad steps out. He's got a rain jacket and boots on and I realize immediately he's heading up to the barn - along the path that leads not thirty feet from where I'm hanging naked.
Now I have a couple options here. Immediately discarded was to brazen it out - though I might do that today, I was far too insecure at the time. I could run and hide - there were bushes only about fifty feet away across the lawn. But I'd just read Jurassic Park, and remembered the plot point about how dinosaurs react to movement, and can't see prey standing still.
So I decided that my best recourse was to hang completely still - upside down, naked, erect in the night and the rain - and that my dad wouldn't see me as he walked past. Now keep in mind that I'm one of the whitest motherfuckers you're likely to meet now or ever, and was even whiter then. Looking back with the wisdom of advanced age, I bet I positively glowed.

&gt; But there I am, upside down and trying to stay as still as possible. I want to say my hand was frozen on my upside down cock because it makes for better theater but I don't remember. My dad heads up the path, looking at the ground in front of him and mumbling under his breath. I'm silently urging him to speed up but he positively ambles.
Then he draws abreast of me on the path and something catches his eye. He looks up, furrows his brow. Turns to his left, toward me. Leans forward and takes a step off the path as if to get a better look at the jungle gym. I stop breathing, would stop my heart beating if I knew how. He squints through the rain, I presume, though I can't see. Pauses for ten seconds ... fifteen ... twenty ...

&gt; ... then shrugs, mutters something, and continues on his way up to the barn.
I know now that there's no way my dad couldn't have seen me. Despite the rain, despite the darkness, despite my intimate knowledge of dinosaur visual systems, I was too close and too white. But my dad - whatever his faults - is a pretty cool and froody guy, and understanding of teenage embarrassment.

&gt; As mortified as I was at breakfast the next morning, he never said anything about it, then or ever - not even a wry crack about wanting to take a walk in the rain, or flip my perspective on things. He just kept on walking up to the barn that night, giving my thirteen-year-old ass time to flip off the bars, scamper naked back to my room, and finish off with the JC Penney catalog. Thanks, dad. You must have been thirteen and horny once too.
&gt; tl;dr - My dad caught me masturbating upside down and naked but pretended he didn't see.","1283305312"

You have to live in Australia to understand the problem. In Australia it is called ""The Tyranny of Distance"". Australia (excluding Antarctica, which is not a country) has the lowest population on earth. Last time I checked the population per square Km was ridiculously low. When you head for the nearest city, you are talking about 5-10 hours driving in most cases. Perth, is the most isolated city on earth... you will drive for almost 24 hours to get to the nearest city. To live in any Australian city you need a car. It is not an option. You may be able to catch a bus, but then you would need hours to walk the rest of the way to get to your destination. ""Just down the road"" in Australia is a 50Km drive. These distances also mean that more petrol is consumed. There is no alternative.

I am not defending some Australians though. Some have to have massive low efficiency cars and drive around all day with just the driver in the car. Schools are also embarrassing. It is not surprising for Australian schools who claim to be ""Green"" to have no bus service at all, and no car pooling either.","1283305332"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I wish other people would be a bit more delicate in the comments, but I suppose I understand their issue... and I understand yours, because I've been there.

At about your age, the notion of my being gay had begun to trace its way into my mind.  I hated the idea.  I hated the thoughts.  I hated, to a very real extent, myself... and I'm one of the lucky ones:  My family is fairly progressive and I'm sure would be able to handle the fact given time, but there's something else to handling this identity.  Whether your family and social circles are accepting or not, there remains a very loud voice in your mind, especially when you're young, that this isn't normal.  You begin to believe that something's wrong with you, that you're not meant to be this way and that it *will* be fixed.  You comfort yourself by imagining a future image of yourself with a loving wife, cradling a child and living a ""normal"" familial life.

But it's a façade, and as you develop into who you are you're still stuck with the perceived problem, and are presented with a choice:  Continue believing yourself to be faulty, something that can and should be mended, or come to terms with who you've grown to be.

I understand the terror, because in many ways I'm still there.  I'm still too terrified to reveal myself to my family.  It absolutely isn't easy, and in this struggle to understand yourself, you can absolutely come up with unusual caveats.

I don't say this in arrogance, but you're still young, and you still have plenty of time to figure it out on your own.  Remember that even if someone you know or love may hate you for who you are, don't let that someone be you.  Fighting yourself is a nasty affair;  Whether you decidedly win or lose, you're still defeated.

And as a piece of practical advice, if you do one day understand yourself to be gay, don't panic, and don't feel forced to leave the closet **until you are ready**.  If anything, avoid telling your family until you're an independent.

Best of luck to you.","1283305337"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","&gt; Fact- No one gets incarcerated for possession of under and ounce with the current laws unless they are stupid enough to carry multiple bags or a scale in which case they will face possession with intent to sell, and that's their fault for once again being an idiot

About people just getting misdemeanors for possession, thats true. A lot of people will never even go to a court for simple possession. But is their record tainted no less?  What about the cost to process these possession offenders or simple concept of government spending on combating marijuana in our state of CA. Its estimated we spend between 280-370 Million dollars a year in CA to ""combat"" marijuana in our state with 215-300 million of that money on offenders over the age of 21. Thats a shit ton of money. Now I'm not backtracking on my prison argument I still think it will defiantly open up some cells for some rapists or pedos out there. But the amount of money spent to fight marijuana is just ridiculous  and IF legalized imagine where else this money could be spent, schools, hospitals what not. Even if it was 10% of that money it would make our state a better place in other areas. 

something thats closer to me. A friend of mine was pulled over, his car ""smelled"" like weed so they searched his car and found 2 ounces worth of dank. Now my friend is also a Prop 215 patient with papers and a legit reason. He got to spend a night in Jail (who paid for that?) got his car impounded, lost his job because he couldn't go to work. He **went to court** and the judge threw out the case because he had a legit medical card and reason to have it. They ordered the sheriffs department to return his repossessed weed. While this story might seem to have a happy ending it really doesn't. My friend lost his job, had to pay money to get his car out of impound and his reputation tainted for being a patient. If legalizing it helps prevent instances like this its worth it. 

As for this ""oakland mafia"" and big business wanting to profit off of marijuana, theres no way around it. No matter how you legalize it. the only way to prevent/ not support big business would be to grow your own. 5x5 is plenty of space to grow what I call the perpetual harvest, 10 plants vegging, 10 plants flowering, and 10 plants to harvest every month. Thats a lot of weed 

**TLDR** Many people wont go to prison for simple possession. The point is our government spends too much money trying to stop us from smoking pot. Grow your own weed.","1283305338"

So let's see how this policy would affect the economy.  If the Fed makes a 1 time deposit of $4,000 in every person's account, monetary supply will expand but the incentives to save vs consume will not.  In fact, from previous economic studies (one-time reparations paid to jews, cash settlements paid to groups exposed to toxins and others) have showed that people tend to save the bulk of one-time, non-recurring income.  This means money supply will expand, but money demand will not grow.  This will translate into 1-time inflation but will fail to stimulate the economy.  ","1283305358"

&gt; Nor do you show that, if any of them are replaced, that they will be replaced using research from neuroscience. 

I never made this claim, nor do I expect it (the first) to happen. Astrology again -- the fact that astronomy exists hasn't affected the kind of people who believe in astrology.

&gt; Or that psychology is a failure but is being used regardless.

So? If neuroscience replaces psychology among educated people and health services providers, it won't matter to psychology's true believers, only to those who want meaningful treatments. Just as with astrology.

&gt; First, after controlling for extensive criminological, demographic, and socioeconomic variables, I found that **blacks, males, and offenders with low levels of education and income receive substantially longer sentences**. Second, disparities are primarily generated by departures from the guidelines, rather than differential sentencing within the guidelines. Departures produce about 55 percent of the black-white difference and 70 percent of the male-female difference. Third, although black-white disparities occur across offenses, the largest differences are for drug trafficking. The Hispanic-white disparity is generated primarily by those convicted of drug trafficking and firearm possession/trafficking. Last, **blacks and males are also less likely to get no prison term when that option is available; less likely to receive downward departures; and more likely to receive upward adjustments and, conditioned on having a downward departure, receive smaller reductions than whites and females**.

Nevermind the far too drawn out and not very good story.  The problem is that you can **really** tell that it was originally conceived as a rail shooter.  Metroid has always been about exploration in an open world.  This one drags you around on a leash from one objective to the next.

The combat system is ok, I actually kind of liked the switch from 2.5D to 3D by switching how you hold the controller.  But like so many modern games combat is just button mashing.  It looks cool when Samus jumps onto enemies, stuffs her gun into their mouthes and blasts them to pieces, but its all either pulling the trigger or holding it to charge.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Weren't you going to throw a sponge onto your ceiling fan while it was set on high? I also feel a little honored that you went though 19 days of my comments to find me something about not wanting to lose karma.

I'm not talking out of both sides of my mouth, I'm forming opinions out of what has been so far presented. Perhaps I need to clarify: I understand that there's a lot of information I don't have. From what was presented in the press release and her court filing, coupled with the stories that my paramedic GF has told me and my understanding of human nature, I think it's likely the cop acted correctly. I'm certainly open to changing that thought were more information to come my way.

Also, I don't care enough about her or this case to spend the 5 seconds googling the issue. As for missing the link in the original article, I've gotten into the habit of ignoring links inside articles because they're so often spam. After seeing VimmyNothing's link, after I made my first post, I read the more detailed story.

Nice turn around of prejudice. You're right. I'm prejudiced against people who are arrested, and over the next few hours and days I may do a little soul searching as to whether or not that's how I want to be. I don't care about her race, but your comments implying that I did touched one of my hot buttons (obviously): I'm a big fan of colorblind policies and actions, which are often labeled racist.  Often people who oppose colorblind policies do so under the (IMO) mistaken opinion that when percentages of blacks and whites differ in the whatever-category-of-the-day, that it's because of racism. And that kind of idiocy is what makes me devote hours to developing a way to slap someone through TCP/IP.

I ""explain away"" police brutality because I try to put myself in the officer's shoes and vary rarely can think that I would have acted better on a bad day. The kind of situations that most officers face on a weekly basis would push me well beyond my breaking point, and I don't like the idea of ruining a cop's life and livelihood because he punched back. Couple that with my disdain for people who break the law and people who attack cops, and I tend to side with police when incidents are ambiguous.

I like my version of the joke more.","1283305448"

This is somewhat true.  Potential energy is the system's stored energy.  This energy of course is dependent on position and not say, motion.  Potential energy exists in this case because gravity is acting to pull the object back down.  However, you also observed kinetic energy in moving the object to it's height.  Assuming the object is stationary at it's peak height, this kinetic energy is now potential.  Law of conservation of energy tells you that it didn't actually ""get energy"" by being at some height but that it's potential energy was once kinetic.","1283305545"

But, we can't outright have TIL that they make VERY good laptops, (where the quality of the product is presumed by 'good' and not just specs), or TIL Cameron Diaz is hot.

I hate to seem really pedantic, but it would be the same sort of standards of Wikipedia. If you have an article on Samsung, you can't just state outright that ""Samsung makes very good laptops;"" again, it's quite subjective, even if many people would feel it to be true.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I've got it. If god creates the rock everywhere all at once then there is then no room for god to be present, therefore god simply turns himself into the rock with his wonder twin powers. (""He"" is god he can use wonder twin powers despite being a single entity.)  Hence because god is the rock, god is both holding him self up in the sense that the rock does not simply implode upon itself. Simultaneously his is not hold himself up because in the vastness that is infinity there is no container and now due to the rock filling infinity there is nothing holding it.  There you go a simple answer is usually the best, if not always the right answer.  (However, I suppose that creating an infinite object simply by magic, i.e. transubstantiation of flesh to stone would hardly be a matter of a simple flick of the wrist.)  

LOL I am sure that you will be able to fill this full of holes but it was fun to give it a try and much better than my first idea which did not stick to your standards of the rock filling infinity in an instant with said rock, which is another brain bender because how exactly would one ""fill"" infinity?  I suppose that you could, if you were wanting to argue rationality you could just stop the thought experiment at filling infinity which simply by definition of infinity is a known impossibility.  Surely, you are screwing up by first granting that god can in fact accomplish the impossible when you give that he could fill infinity.  Don't give those religious idiots anything to stand on because eventually one of them will read my post and carry forth my solution as the answer to this question.  It is sad really though that they have not come up with that answer yet on their own.

To finish, how about we stop trying to do the impossible on our own and let the burden of proof/disproof rest in its rightful place with the believers.  I know that there is no rational way to prove or disprove the existence of a god, but I simply don't give a damn because the believers are the once that need to prove that it is so or I will never number myself among them.  It is a waste of everyone's time to argue the existence of god, in much the same way, it is to try to prove that my first thought was, ""I could go for a case of beer and some titties right now.""  You can't prove that it was not and I can never convince you that it is.  Try moving on to a more constructive field of argument against believers like the fact that they are self righteous, racist, money grubbing, fascists, that are the single most eminent tool in the destruction of mankind.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I did in a certain sense, yes.

The way I ""got over"" it (and I put it in quotes because such feelings never entirely leave you, they only become manageable and marginalised to the point of no longer dominating your thoughts) was to take pride in who I was, not strive to meet other peoples' ideas of normal or what was acceptable, expected, or culturally considered desirable. When you look at who you are and think ""these are the ways I don't fit in"" you have to own and take pride in those things.

It will not always win you friends and it certainly won't win you a gilded path to Easy Street, but self-love and peace of mind is something no amount of fame or fortune could ever buy. :) It's not just because you're a woman that you're feeling this way, but because you're a woman who *does* x, y, and z. Whatever those letters stand in for- your art, your self expression, how you see the world around you- you have to take pride in that.

You can never simply say ""fuck off"" to certain people. I wish it were so easy. It's an encouraging thing to tell someone ""be yourself and anyone who doesn't like it can fuck off!"" But it doesn't often pan out. It's part of our pervasive cultural myth of the power of the individual. You *don't* have the power to make unpleasantness go away all the time, you *can't* always control everything in your life. Paradoxically, however, realising that left me feeling powerful. Why? Because I was better able to judge things and not constantly beating up on myself for not being strong enough or good enough or whatever.

Ironically, recognising that you are powerless in some situations makes you very powerful- as knowing any truth does. If you know what's *actually happening* you can better respond to and deal with it using what agency you have, rather than adhereing to the myth that if only you were strong willed enough nothing bad would ever happen to you.

So I take a measure of pride in being a woman. I have no control over what I was born as and in one respect it's silly to be proud of such a thing, but I *made myself* a woman who does certain things, who talks a certain way, and who dares to be herself. Those things, I did make, and have every right to be proud of.

It is also true, as Siljak says:

&gt;You're quite right about the ""fuck you"" approach tending to render you lonely &amp; unapproachable, and I certainly went through that phase, but the end result of that is that you end up with a smaller set of genuine friends and a much happier relationship with yourself. If that means you have to piss of the kind of people who expect you to be something other than you actually are (or have the potential to be) then that's a damn good thing in my opinion.

I have good, true friends and loved ones in my life because I do not hide who I am. They accept me as a whole person, not because I'm trying to be something I'm not.

The feeling is indescribably wonderful. :)

&gt;I just start to feel so lonely sometimes, because I feel like no other women are out there. I know it's not true but that's how it feels.

You know it's not true, so reach out to them. That's something you can do- find blogs and web communities by women in your field, see if there are any where you live and hook up with them. :) I know what this feels like and trust me when I say even online communities will help you feel *so* less alone.

As I said, real strength comes from seeing things as they are and negotiating them in that context, and other women in your field will definitely help, as will finding men who sympathise with your situation. There are, certainly, in my own life many men who ""get it"" and they're just as good friends when it comes to helping me recharge after a tough day.

&gt;I think I could be happy with any way that my life ended up, as long as I felt like I'd ended up with personal integrity

Then you already made half the journey. :) Some folks are afraid of not ending up with tonnes of wealth or a big house and two cars in the garage. That you aren't troubled by that means it's going to be all the easier to be yourself.

The final thing to keep in mind is something that I certainly don't mean as a downer, but hear me out: this feeling won't quite ever leave you. I only say this because it can be all too easy on a hard or shitty day to feel yourself backsliding into the old insecurities and hate yourself for it. I've been there. But remember the world we were raised in, how pervasive its ideas are, how constant its influence is. You cannot academically realise ""Oh, I don't feel like I'm good enough because of x. Huh. Guess I won't feel that way anymore.""

That's not true of anything and it certainly isn't true of this. So even if you feel like you're losing faith someday, don't think yourself the weaker for it. A lot of us have been there. :)","1283305607"

Doesn't this fit the same category you're essentially arguing against?  MSP doesn't have any known physiological markers and the term is used to describe a set of behaviours, which puts it on the side of 'Description' in your 'Description vs. Explanation' section.

The rich people ponied up post WWII because it was the USA that let them be rich.  They would do well to remember that again and show a little patriotism.

Taxing at that rate did NOT cripple the economy.  Those years were the some of the most prosperous in our nation's history.  The middle class exploded under that tax policy.  That's historic fact.  

Finally, the rich have total control of their income. When you tax income at that rate, the wealthy lower their salaries to avoid the tax.  Instead they plough the money back into industry in order to increase the value of their existing holdings in a tax free way.  This drives the economic engines of our nation.  Giving them tax breaks just results in looting.  See: http://www.mytaxcut.us/images/taxratesandincome.gif

how income rates run inverse to tax rates for the top 1%?

Granted, the ruling went down split by party-associated philosophical grounds, but still, I think the ""liberal"" judges were the ones attempting to be ""activist"". The ""conservative"" faction had the more defensible position.

Really, Gore could have won on a recount by simply demanding Florida be recounted as a whole, but the Democrats were too chickenshit, and tried to limit it to districts they thought would help them. I maintain that the real problem was fucking Gore. The man is such a wooden loser that he actually managed to let the election be *close enough* that a man who can't assemble a complete sentence was near enough to win by virtue of Florida. Same could be said of Kerry in '04. Democrats needed to quit running old-guard political losers and actually put someone **interesting** in the race.","1283305638"

OK, the number that was displayed was your house phone's. That doesn't necessarily means anything. I'm not 100% sure, but I've heard that I could set up the PABX at work to send whatever caller id I want.

Where are your windows? Is it possible that someone could control your TV from outside, using a remote?

It's possible that it happens regularly (especially if you're near the end of the electrical line), but you only noticed it today because you were freaking out from the TV incident.

First, consider whether you've really outgrown your company.  Are there additional responsibilities you could take on that would be interesting/beneficial to you in the long run?  If there are, discuss them with your boss.  It's a good opportunity to talk about stagnating in your current role and opens up a reasonable discussion of your salary.

If you get the new job, take 24 hours before accepting the offer, make sure you give your old employer adequate notice before leaving (usually 2 weeks, but can be longer depending on your responsibilities) and make sure to be proactive about working with your boss on a transition plan before you leave so you can make a clean break and they won't think you left them hanging.

Finally, make sure you think about what you would require to stay in your current role BEFORE you discuss any counteroffers, it will allow you to be more rational about it and not be guilted into staying (if your employer is prone to that).

**tldr;** at least 2 weeks notice, finish your current work before you go, and decide what it would take for you to stay at your current job before you quit in case of a counteroffer.","1283305655"
"funny","t5_2qh33","It's total pedantry! I even referred to myself as boorish for mentioning it in the initial post, lol.

As to white Mexicans not looking like pure Europeans— Why do you assume that ""European"" means ""Northern European""? Brown hair, brown eyes and olive skin are far, FAR more common in Europe than blond hair and blue eyes. Not just in the Mediterranean, but in the Balkans, Serbia, Albania, Greece, pockets of Northern Europe [like the Saami in Scandinavia or the Welsh in England]. You have tons of dark hair and olive skin from absolutely 100% pure Europeans. Blondism is the variation, the genetic anomaly. The dark type is the far older paleolithic type, and is the original type from which the fair type is a new adaptation. (By most estimates, it's only about 6,000-10,000 years old. In other words, a blond European like Rutger Hauer is the ""new type,"" whereas the olive-skinned, dark haired type like Catherine Zeta Jones is the old type which goes back 50,000 years in Europe.]

So, ironically, Mexico's Gael Garcia Bernal is far more representative of a ""generic European type,"" statistically and historically than some albino from Denmark.

i moved home, in what was a logical move for myself, my child, and my mother, who was suffering from health problems at the time and in an ugly marriage, herself. together, she and i got out of our misery, and now are both living much healthier lives. shortly after moving into my own apartment, i did the stupidest thing i've ever done in my life; i let my son's dad move in. i told myself i was doing it to try and fix my family, but i know that i knew, even then, i was only prolonging my own agony. at that time, my son was six months old or so. i never allowed him alone with our child, so i know that he never harmed him in any way, but things between he and i never got any better. he continued to be abusive, hateful, and ugly. i supported him for a long time, and as soon as i became unable to work, he started to bail. i found out he was sleeping with his ex wife (not that i *cared*), and finally, told him to leave. i will say that i was grateful that he left peacefully. that was about 16 months ago. he saw his son a few times after that.

he then began dating a woman who had her child removed from her custody after the military discerned that her daughter's severe brain damage was caused by physical abuse on her part, and that of her now ex-husband. i told him when he began seeing her that i was NOT going to allow her to have ANY part in my son's life. this was around the time we began testing/diagnosing/treating my son for his various disabilities. he chose to stay with her. she had another man's baby about a year ago, and as far as i know, he's ""caring"" for that child, working at a sam's club, and in general being a waste of human flesh. he hasn't seen his son for one year, as of this upcoming weekend, actually. we do not miss him.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","2a)  Did I play PC games first?  Yes.  Do I buy more than 3 PC games a year?  This year, yes.  On average, no.  Do I have a PC with a graphics card in it?  Yes.  All three of these arguments are bullshit though.  They prove nothing other than that at one time or another I have played PC games, and if I hadn't answered with a yes for this year, you would have even less to go on.  On average I buy more console games per year.  And the whole having a graphics card....that's just a garbage argument.

2b)  A ""gaming PC"" from 5 years ago can still play games released today.  As a matter of fact, the computer that I just replaced(due to hardware failure, which consoles do to) could still play most new games at decent settings.  It was 6 and a half years old.  You have to replace your XBox when the new one comes out whatever it may be called.  It's still an upgrade.  And you won't be able to play new games without it.

2c)  You are paying for online multiplayer, access to NetFlix, and soon you'll be paying for an ESPN, which should be optional, but is besides the point.  You still haven't stated a feature that XBL offers to paid customers that other companies don't give away for free which is the entirety of your argument.

3)  Your original argument for this point was dull, and added nothing to the mix, but if you want to keep going, that's fine.  I already agreed with you about bad mannered American players, just stop generalizing with your limited knowledge of the world.  

4)  Okay.

4.1a)  Valve does not give anything away for free.  Well, yes, eventually it does boil down to this, but not charging a fee to play a game online that I already purchased and isn't supported by dedicated servers is the problem.  Microsoft charges a fee to play games online that you've already purchased.  Valve doesn't.  Sony doesn't.  Nintendo doesn't.  The only games that require a fee to play after purchase are MMOs.  But the few that are on XBL still require you to be a Gold Subscriber on top of the games subscription fee, now paying two companies monthly to play one game.  Yes, people still buy games despite certain missing features.  Far more people just jump on the hate train because of anonymity and lack of accountability and in private they don't keep their word.  This is why companies don't listen to anonymous postings or a bunch of online petitions.  They don't mean anything.  As for the L4D2 jab...well, people buy expansion packs all the time.  But it's a full game's worth of content, and they still support free content for L4D1.  

4.1b)  Not owning a mic has nothing to do with your argument.  Microsoft doesn't give you a microphone for being a subscriber.  You can buy a pack that has X months of game time and a mic, but they don't force you, no company does, to own one.

4.1c)  Live charges for things that are free elsewhere, yes, but you have yet to name a service they charge for that is better than one of the free alternatives.  Just because they have more free services doesn't mean that they can charge for the one thing that every other company gives away.  Also, MS doesn't implement achievements, the developer does.  Microsoft requires achievements from the developers to be in a game before it goes gold.

4.2)  Here you've all but stated that glitching the game to gain an unfair advantage is okay, but hacking is not.  I will admit that there is a difference between hacks and glitches, but the end result is the same, and the last game I played on XBL was MW2 and although they may have fixed the problem of the javelin glitch or the dual shot gun OP they still have had other bugs and it ruins the game just as hackers do.

5)  This is all poor justification for MS charging for multi-player gaming.  Nothing to really counter as you are just regurgitating the same rhetoric over and over again.  

As for why I care.  I just wanted to point out where your argument fell short.  The big picture, I don't want other companies seeing Microsoft charging for the ability to play online games and follow suit.  I want Microsoft to change their business model, not others.","1283305705"

Agreement to implicit contracts cannot be demonstrated by inaction. Agreement to implicit contracts can be demonstrated by knowing receipt of services.
&gt;There is no meeting of the minds. There is no offer or acceptance. There is not necessarily an exchange of value. And performance or delivery by the state is entirely at their discretion, they need not provide anything, yet they will still demand that you pay taxes.

No meeting of the minds? Are you saying either you or the government doesn't understand the terms here? Are you saying no one does? If you say that you do not, I question the honesty here, and I question the level to which it's your responsibility to educate yourself on these matters.

No offer or acceptance? The offer happens through the entirety of your education, in the case of natural born citizens, or through the citizenship training. Acceptance is implicit when you receive services after the offer.

Not necessarily an exchange of value? Is your tax money not worth anything? Is police protection, fire protection, national security, etc. worth *nothing*? I can see it being of marginal value, but **worth nothing**??

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","How do you feel about this scenario? You are in the hospital for surgery on a pelvic issue. The doctor asks you if it is okay for your surgery to be for training of Thomas the med student (who you have met). You say okay. During the surgery the doctor has to feel for the mass to double check its location and size before cutting (which often occurs). Would it be okay for the student who is being trained to do the same? 

IMHO, if one were to say that they were okay with a student using their pelvic surgery as a learning case, then it is assumed that they are going to do whatever the doctor does, and in the case of gyn surgery that often involves pelvic exams right before the actual cutting.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","I have a mechanical engineering degree and have been in the workforce since Feb. of 2009. I would have to say that a mechanical engineering degree was a good choice for me. It's not for everyone, but it is a good degree that can get you a lot of places. I am currently a medical device engineer for a large company. When I was interviewing for the job I asked ""why are you looking at mechanical engineers?"" when the job was clearly open to many types of engineers. They replied that they were looking for critical thinkers that know how to learn. Many engineering degrees give critical thinking skills, and with the broad base of mechanical engineering you can get many different jobs. When it comes to the degree itself, do what you love. You'll be better at the discipline if you love learning about it. 

Thanks to the critical thinking skill set given to a person with an engineering degree the transition to business is a breeze. Just look at the undergraduate degrees of many fortune 500 executives. You'll find plenty of engineering degrees from the core disciplines. The only skill set an engineer doesn't get in class is social skills. The only advice I can give on that is to get involved in school (do anything!), get engineering internships, and read Dale Carnegie's book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" a lot. 

What you're expected to do as an engineer all depends on your job. In the medical device field I work with polymers on a daily basis. I also run experiments, create test methods, and debate with ""quality"" engineers whose sole job is to make sure my documentation fits within the company's (absolutely necessary) Quality system. Navigating people's emotions and feelings (otherwise known as politics) comes with the territory of any job in any profession. The better you are at politics, the more likely you'll advance in any line of work. You do get an upper edge on the other engineers if you can crack a joke or two and don't come off as an arrogant know-it-all like so many do (I am even guilty of that at times). 

At the end of it all, just do what you love. An engineering degree (not a design degree) can go beyond what is printed on the paper and will help you navigate this crazy economy we have inherited. If you decide you don't like engineering, finish up the degree anyways, you can sell a lot of different skills with what you practiced in college. ","1283305769"

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","I see re-affirmation in this topic of: ""If there's an actor or director in the audience at an opening or film festival then it makes sense."" But why would the people with the most self-congratulatory careers (based on wage valuation, the egotistic pursuit of hyperbolic self-marketing and the number of different awards and awards organizations) need further reassurance? I'd rather clap for the robot projectionist.

Joking aside, we live in a public culture. Applauding the night sky while alone on a hilltop in Spain might be stupid because what's being communicated isn't received by anyone except yourself. Applauding when someone else can hear it is useful because it communicates exactly what you want to communicate to others: i.e. I liked this.

Consider that people applaud fireworks, trained dogs and whales, airshow tricks, fountains, gifts (even the event of *receiving* a gift), bonfires and all other manners of events, things or performers who have no way of receiving the communication. They even congratulate sick kids who have done nothing but *passively* acquire leukemia - far less than someone who *intentionally* judged a movie in a room full of strangers. While that last sentence was obviously facetious, doesn't the child understand that we approve of them and their right to life as a person by this applause? And aren't we simultaneously encouraging his or her spirit and communicating to each other that we have all united in support of this child's cause?

This is why everyone in the cheap old 70's era cinema performed a standing ovation at the end of the Grindhouse double-feature. Because it was an awesome event and by a standing ovation - let alone applause - we communicated, almost unanimously, that we thought the movie had gone above and beyond what was expected. 

Applause isn't for the performers alone and it has many contexts and meanings; it's usually just a sign of personal approval (or encouragement or sarcastic heckling) that other human beings, and not just the focus of the event, can interpret. ","1283305774"

Motorcycling is inherently less safe for many reasons, but by riding with a good brain in your head it's possible to give yourself the time to react appropriately to these dangers. Wearing all the gear, illuminating yourself and attracting as much attention as possible (in whatever way you can, the more attention the better), maintaining good following distances and constantly scanning everything everywhere to predict what will happen. These are all tactics to make motorcycling a lot more safe than many would imagine it. Mention these things to your parents, and then actually _do_ them if/when you get the chance.

"answers","t5_2qkeh","Perhaps I should've qualified it with more than just the ""maybe"" to also stipulate that this the water/vitamin thing is a very temporary measure: in the long run, you *have* to eat.

I was under the impression that fat is energy (i.e. a storage mechanism for excess calories), albeit not as quickly and easily metabolized into actual energy as actual sugar. Also, muscle is metabolized as a last ditch effort once even the fat reserves run out, which isn't a problem in the situation described by the OP.

The only way (short of liposuction) to lose weight is to basically consume fewer calories than you burn. Not eating at all is taking this to its (un)natural extreme and results in an unhealthy streak because you end up depriving yourself of necessary nutrients. Instead, you should reduce your consumption and increase your exercise--more calories burnt *and* increased muscle mass will cause a faster metabolism.

TL;DR: Don't stop eating; eat *less*, exercise more and the body will automatically use the fat reserves to make up the difference between what you consume and what you need.","1283305799"

Visiting an idyllic German village, Werther, a sensitive young man, falls in love with sweet-natured Lotte. Though he realizes that Lotte is to marry Albert, he is unable to subdue his passion and his infatuation torments him to the point of despair. The first great 'confessional' novel, it draws both on Goethe's own unrequited love for Charlotte Buff and on the death of a close friend. The book was an immediate success and a cult rapidly grew up around it, resulting in numerous copycat deaths as well as violent criticism and suppression for its apparent support of suicide. Goethe's exploration of the mind of an artist at odds with society and ill-equipped to cope with life remains as poignant as when it was first written.

But here is my dilemma: I go into a salon, I sit down and tell the lady what kind of cut I want. No more than 7 minutes later, she's dusting my neck off and I'm on my way, but I'm still charged between 20 and 35 bucks. The same price she'd get if she would've spent 25 or 30 minutes cutting a woman's head. 

These aren't high-end salons, mind you. No, these are run-of-the-mill small town salons--some of them chains, but nothin' fancy.
I would much rather pay $8-13 for a 7-minute cut and leave a $5-8 tip. I try to tip generously (past employment has left me sensitive to the service industry), but it's hard to do when the cut itself costs so much.

I had $100 cash and an additional $1000 in a paypal account I was ready to immediately transfer in to start the account.  

At the BofA there were a few gorgeous women in tight polo shirts who were more than happy to take my money.  I sit down with one, I think her name was cindy or mandy or something equally peppy, and we go over the account options which she's super-psyched to tell me about.  Through the course of our ""conversation"" (if it can even be called that) I find out that, unless I have $500 in the account at all times I'll be charged a fee.  More so, I discover that she had no idea what the fuck paypal was and that I'd have to wait while she spoke to some manager.

...After waiting in silence for 45 minutes I left and went over to TD Bank.  A not so attractive, but knowledgeable woman set up my account in about 10 minutes.  She knew what paypal was, it wouldn't be a problem, my account required no minimum, I had ""overdraft protection"" turned off and I transferred $1000 into the account right there.

* Put a towel at the bottom of your door to block air.
* Put a fan or two blowing out of your room. Find a spot where the air is flowing out of the room -- this is where you want to light up and blow smoke. Right behind the fan works well.
* Smoke bowls or bongs -- no blunts or joints.
* Blow straight out the room. Don't let ANY smoke stay in the house.
* Keep the windows open and fans on for a few minutes after you spray air freshener. Oder eliminating kind is the best. Axe will do, but isn't preferred because it covers up rather than eliminates.
* Blow out of a paper towel / toilet paper roll filled with dryer sheets if you want -- it'll make the smoke smell better and not be as noticeable.
* Most of all, have a plan of what to do if your dad / mom comes in. Keep everything hidden but what you need at that moment.

2) Providing I do manage to negotiate a slightly older child,  5 years is VERY influential on child's life, not to mention older.  Any damage done in foster care would have to be undone through very careful support.  With my own child, I can at least try and ensure that no type of permanent harm comes them in the formative years.

I can't guarantee he/she won't have a severe learning disability (if young) or develop a genetic based disease when they are older and still in my care.  While I am not saying I would dump my adopted child if he had problems, I would actually do my best to raise him/her,  I do not want to risk a gamble like that because it can and will be a HUGE addition to the already humongous emotional load that comes with raising a child and I planning on being an engineer, a job well known for being stressful as it is.

At the end of the day, there is no game... ""Game"" for men is simply becoming more attractive and confident, and having the willingness to go out and put that attractive and confidence in action.

Of course I'm not saying that any given guy can pick up any given girl, or that every girl can be picked up or seduced...  I'm just saying that if a truly skilled PUA is trying to seduce you, you'll never know he's a PUA unless he tells you.

The police come and take them all to jail. (W.C. too. This was during Prohibition and applejack was illegal.) Walking down an alley, the cop asks W.C. what time it is. While fumbling around for his watch he trips over a trash can and makes a big racket, prompting someone to yell out of a window: ""Do you know it's 3:30 in the morning?""

I had random bald patches appear here and there, some would grow back and others would progress. Eventually it progressed into alopecia universalis in my early 20's, which is no hair whatsoever. No eyelashes, eyebrows, body hair, pretty well nothing at all now. Being young was tough. Kids are mean let me tell ya, and I wore a hat everywhere I went. Some of my closest friends never even saw me without it because I was very insecure about it. I was this way until I was about 20 years old before I decided to change my ways. It was really tough man, and believe me, no one will understand unless they're in this situation, it almost feels like going naked in public. My solution was to shave my head, which is fairly normal to do in this day and age. It was the best decision I ever made. I'll admit, change is tough at first, but after you pass that big obstacle and come out from hiding, everything just falls into place. Your confidence and self esteem gets a huge boost, which is what women really care about above all, even your hair. I completely understand how change can be very difficult for you; you don't want to bring any extra attention to yourself. Just remember man, there's nothing wrong with you, it's only hair. The only person making a big deal about it is you. I'm at the point where if a cure came around the corner, I'd seriously turn it down.

"flossdaily","t5_2rfp0","Hey Karmasitute,

FrEaK40 set up this subreddit months ago as an archive for my stories and jokes.

People trying to read my fiction can't simply browse through my personal comments because I participate in dozens of threads at a time here on reddit.  Trying to find anything that is a self-contained bit of prose would be an enormous chore, because 95% of what I'm writing tends to be casual and conversational.

Without a doubt, it is the warmth of the reddit audience that keeps me writing, and that goes double for the folks that are kind enough to check out this subreddit.  I wouldn't write nearly as much if it weren't for their encouragement.  They make me feel as if I'm doing something worthwhile when I write, rather than letting it feel like I'm just wasting my time.

But I think that the evidence doesn't support your contention that this subreddit affects my karma.  My top rated comments were made before this subreddit existed.  And my top rated comments this month didn't even get linked to from this subreddit.  I got something like 10,000 karma in a 24-hour span for posting jokes about a deaf amputee, and then posting an AMA.  The deaf-amputee joke didn't even get a link here, and the AMA?  The link itself only got a net of 5 upvotes, so I doubt very much that the karma I got from that came from this subreddit.

Think about it this way:  Most *subscribers* to this subreddit are here because they like Sterile updates.  Last time I posted an update, after two weeks that story got only 60 upvotes for the first section.  That is the measure of the vote boost I get for posting something here.  It's really just a drop in the bucket compared to the eyes that find my comment by accident on busy subreddits like ""/r/askreddit"".

You might argue that posting something here will get the critical few upvotes it takes to get a comment to the top early on, but you'd be overestimating the number and frequency of visitors I have to /r/flossdaily.  Honestly, at best I could expect maybe 7 upvotes in the first hour?  Let me tell you, that's *nothing* compared to the votes you need to get a comment to snowball on /r/askreddit.

On top of that, I've frequently got people running greasemonkey scripts that literally downvote all my comments the minute that I write them.  So before *anyone* could possibly read them, they've already been moved to the *bottom* of the stack.

As a final note, I'd like to mention that I've never asked anyone to upvote any of my comments, ever.  Sure, I like people to look at them, but they vote up or down based on merit, just like everyone else's comments.

tl;dr:  This subreddit is an archive because my comment history is simply unsearchable.  And even if I wanted to use it as an upvote factory, it simply wouldn't work.","1283306059"

Especially because PD is caused by bacteria and cortisone will weaken your immune system and let the bacteria thrive. Together with the cortisone you should also be using either systemic or topical antibiotics. If Hydrocortisone isn't cutting it, you should try something a little more potent such as Desonide, but always together with an antibiotic.

Topical Calcineurin inhibitors such as Pimecrolium or Tacrolimus may work as well as corticosteroids without the side effects. But always remember the antibiotic.","1283306081"

However. If he's spent the last two years playing video games instead of spending time with you (which is understandable as you're in class/studying), he may now have the impression that *that* is what your relationship is. He may be into buying the house and marriage *because* he never has to spend time with you. He may prefer the relationship this way.

Only you have the best handle on what he may be thinking or going through, and only you can say whether your rational, sensible, serious fiance is just in a phase right now. 

The only thing I'm trying to advocate is that you work your issues out *now*, before you get married. Even if it means postponing your vows. Things do get harder to fix once marriage is involved, and it becomes a million times harder to leave a doomed marriage than any other type of relationship. Try like hell to work it out, but if it doesn't happen... Don't stay in any relationship just because of time served and memories of how good things used to be.

Each coil feeds one cylinder on each bank, so one bad coil would give you a misfire code corresponding to the cylinders that it fires *only*, and a lean condition on BOTH BANKS.

Generally what you find is that you get either a fouled plug or a bad (high resistance) wire, which takes out the corresponding coil pack and sometimes the module as well.

Coil packs can be easily bench-tested (Ohm across the primary, compare to the other 2, ohm across the secondary, compare to the other 2) and they NEVER, EVER all fail at once.  If the wires are original they should have been replaced at the same time as a matter of course, but that's nitpicking...

As far as the fuel filter, maybe it helped and maybe it didn't - it probably did need one based on mileage.

If you want to be a dick about it, you could ask to see the plugs.  If there's one bad one the goof probably loosened a wire getting the oil filter off or something.

The average continuous power of solar PV energy on the entire planet was thus the equivalent of 1658 MWe of a continously operated power plant of any type.*

&gt;Wow, that sure was a hard choice to make. Let's cut spending and cut taxes and a pony for everyone. And ice cream, gotta have ice cream.

&gt;Those are things that everyone who doesn't have to deal with reality espouses. And fluffy bunnies, I forgot the fluffy bunnies.

If you want to talk about dealing with reality, lets do it. Lets start with the demographics. If you neglect the illegal immigrant population, the Unites States has a declining population. This means that there will be fewer people paying taxes in the future than there are now. As a result, social security will become insolvent. You can't sustain such a program indefinitely, especially when we are already borrowing money from overseas. There can not perpetually be a deficit, you have to raise taxes, cut spending, or go bankrupt. If you want to deal with *reality* there you go. Where is it *you* want to cut? Same old cliche' about the war? Lets deal with *reality*, power vacuum's kill, how many more innocent civilians do you want to die? I bet it would pale in comparison to the deaths to date. Time machines don't exist yet, so saying that we never should have started those wars won't cut it. Want to raise taxes? You know people don't like that right? It won't be very popular, and as long as someone is not for it they will probably get lots of support, at least as long as some people would rather cut spending than increase taxes. I guess if all of the representatives were to support tax increases then it would be pretty easy to do. But then those who don't want their taxes to increase would have no representation, wait, that sounds familiar.

The gist of much of his advice is that (virtually) nothing is weird/off limits/etc., you just have to find like-minded people and be honest with those who might not have the same tendencies or who have different expectations. It might be hard for you to find dudes who don't expect you to become emotionally attached, because that's what society expects of women (not that that's right, accurate, or fair... it's a double standard, and a lame one). 

It sounds like maybe you're feeling pressure to conform to this norm when it doesn't actually interest you at all. You shouldn't feel bad for that, much less like a sociopath. But, even though dudes have been known for behaving this way (again, not implying that it's wrong), much of the time dishonestly, and with little or no explanation, for like, eternity, it's good to be honest with people about what you expect from them and about what they should realistically expect from you. Anyway, Dan can explain all this much better than I can... it's worth a trip through the archives.

EDIT: Forgot something. If you find yourself wanting to feel emotionally attached sexually, try to find out why you want that. Do you really feel like you're lacking something, or do you feel like it's what you *should* want? If emotional attachment is what you really do want, but you feel like you can't get there, then take a look and try to find out what's holding you back. Vulnerability is scary, and can be even in the most solid of relationships, and there's certainly nothing wrong with or abnormal about that. Whatever the answer is, it's worth exploring... just be honest with people in the meantime.","1283306161"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;they are using principals of the scientific method on why and how we are but not using them when it comes to our life prior and post life because they are implying that something came from nothing and then goes into being nothing once again which disregards the laws of energy and matter.

Here's one way to conceptualize the mind. [Imagine a flock of starlings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81wFZavdhPU&amp;feature=related). See how they move in unison, almost like a single, amorphous, conscious being? Yet, as you know, each starling is a separate bird. Each bird operates within a certain set of parameters: keep a minimum distance from other birds, stay within the air wake of the bird in front to reduce drag, etc. What results when each bird follows these individual rules is an *emergent behavior*: the appearance of mass-organization where the actual act of coordination and organization is not present. These birds *aren't* the Blue Angels; they don't coordinate their flight paths. They just take off when everyone else does (one of the rules) and then follow their own rules.

Also, if at one moment all the starlings decided to fly off in separate directions, we would not say that they are violating laws of conservation of mass or energy, they are simply disassociating from the group and thus losing their *group* characteristic. Aside from that, each of the birds is still as they were a minute before, nothing physical is lost.

Consider your mind in the same context. What you know as ""consciousness"" or ""mind"" may simply be the *emergent behavior* of the neurons of your brain. Consciousness and mind is not a physical entity itself, but a phenomenon of the organization of physical entities. Before you were alive the parts that made up the neurons in your brain still existed, and they will exist after you die. But for this brief period they are those starlings, giving the appearance (and the reality) of a subjective mind.

From this perspective there is no more reason to say that there must exist a form of consciousness before or after death then there is a reason to assume an unobservable starling flock must still exist before they take flight in the morning and after they land for the evening.

Another way to think of it, and this is a quote I just heard here the other day, but you can think of you existence as finite, or infinite with a brief period of consciousness.

From a 18"" barrel a 158 grain hollow point .357 Magnum is moving at 1800 ft/sec. This is a tremendous amount of muzzle energy (1100 ft-lb), for comparison a MK262 cartridge as used by our military's special forces types produces about 1300 ft-lb. Its also a viable deer hunting rifle and it opens the door for you to buy a revolver in the same chambering, so you can use the same ammo for both.  Its manually operated which means its more reliable and with some practice you can really put a great deal of energy down range quickly.  The maximum point blank range for a 158gr .357 magnum fired at 1800 ft/sec is 163 yd, after which it drops quickly (about 10"" at 200 yards). 

They are also around $500.

Market mostly looks at money. We both pointed out organic food costs more money to produce. There are various reasons for that.. Market might also favor certain produce (eg meat) over other (eg crops that grow well in certain area but taste different from what consumer expect).

However, that's all irrelevant, since we were talking about what's more sustainable, not what's cheaper or more popular in current market conditions. You have still offered not even one reason (not even one without evidence) why factory farming is more sustainable than organic farming. I have given plenty for the opposite (""magic"" was not one of them), and you know what, you just ignore them and keep saying the same retarded shit.

This summer in Vancouver (post-Olympics) I went to a concert downtown at the Commodore downtown.  My friend and I went out to toke at intermission.  I was slightly gun shy to be toking in public, but after I started I noticed there were three other separate groups of people lighting up around me.  On Granville street in downtown Vancouver, in broad daylight, with lots of people around.

As far as the Residence shit went, the only reason they even could evict me is that there are no laws whatsoever governing them because the landlord/tenant laws in BC exempt university residence.

If you accept that human beings are not really wired for lifelong, monogamous relationships, and understand the evolutionary basis for our behavior (by ""our"" I mean human beings, both male and female) it's possible to see that a particular man and woman can make a conscious choice to enter into a relationship, while accepting each other's human foibles.

Something else to consider... ""commitment and exclusivity aren't the same thing.""  If we humans got over our hangup on absolutely exclusivity, and instead focused on the commitment part, I think we'd all be better off.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Gay sex is an ""abomination"" or whatever. But remember, the old testament was also totally ok with cousin marriages, slavery, and a variety of other things we commonly consider to be bad now. Also, Catholics aren't Bible literalists. And you'll commonly hear ""Love the sinner, hate the sin"". It's ok to BE gay, but not to act on it. Since you don't seem like you're going to act on it, I can't see any way that you're sinning.

Personally, I don't feel that gay sex in a committed, loving relationship is any different to straight sex in a committed, loving relationship (a la marriage). It's a human need, it brings to a new level of unity, and it's an expression of love. When done without selfish intentions, sex and love can be very closely linked. And since God is, in essence, Love, I can't accept that sex is inherently evil.

I just realized I didn't ask you anything, so...
Do you feel a strong connection to Catholicism?

I did go by their terms for god, so god is omnipresent? So be it. Thus the ""filling"" infinity aspect. In fact, if god wasn't omnipresent, then my proof wouldn't work. I am specifically targeting an omnipotent being.

Because if such a god existed, then it wouldn't be impossible to ""fill"" infinity with rock. Do you see what I mean? Many have tried to argue what you just said, but they haven't been able to give WHY the god couldn't do it, which is precisely it. Given the defined god, an immovable rock can be created.

I give this list for it, which clearly shows that it is possible given such a god: a)      Definition: god is omnipotent (omnipresent as well).
b)      Definition: god can create matter anywhere out of nothing.
c)      Action: god creates matter everywhere he exists / in all space.
d)      Analysis: there is nowhere left to move the object, thus…
e)      Conclusion: god can create an object so large that he cannot move it.

Also, it's fun, it's not a waste of time for me. It's like a big brain puzzle, furthermore, disproving the existence of god universally applies to all believers, not just some of the [insert your tag here] kind of believers.

When all economies are intertwined, it's harder to justify global warfare.  Free trade is one of the major reasons why WW2 was the last large-scale conflict, and subsequent wars have taken place in countries largely unimportant to the global economy, undertaken by one or two major players or proxy forces.

If the U.S. relies on China increase its GDP and China relies on the U.S. to buy its cheap goods, it's unlikely that diplomatic spats will escalate into full-scale war.  If both these countries were utilizing local, insular economies, there's nothing to temper the ""They aren't like us!"" jingoism that has caused so many wars in the past.","1283306294"

* Then save money until you have enough to pay the rent for a year or so.  You don't want your finances to explode the day you get laid off.  Give yourself some breathing room.  Yeah, you'd end up with more money in the end by paying down your debts first, but think of the difference as an insurance premium.
* After that, pay down your other debts in order of interest rates.

Five years ago I would have said pay off all your credit cards first, because if you lose your job you can charge them up again.  But credit card companies have gotten a little sneakier, and I know people who lost their job and then had credit card maximums cut substantially almost the next day.  The old saying about bankers is true:  A banker is a guy who'll lend you an umbrella as long as it's not raining.","1283306345"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Beautiful cartoon, but what really makes it is her heart-string tugging dejected expression in the last panel.

Since I came out I've had the odd experience of being able to experience the night/day shift of what it's like to walk around as a man to what it's like to walk around as a woman. I went from being the everyman on the Subway to someone who is aware of the fact that she's being constantly scrutinised and judged.

I went to jury duty for the first time as a woman, and then I sit down in a row of seats just as the guy next to me looks me up and down and says ""Whoa, you're beautiful, baby."" Walking down 8th Avenue, minding my own business, a man passing me says ""NICE LIPS, BABY!"" and I gesture to the heavens as if to ask ""why?"" just a few metres later. Walking in the neighbourhood of my college a guy blatantly looks me up and down and says ""You're hot!"" I could go on about the wolf whistles and assorted other attempts by men to get my attention.

It's not flattering, and it's always a bit scary. It's also fucked up because on the one hand I think ""well at least I'm gaining conditional cissexual privilege (i.e. ""passing"") as a woman"" which is followed by ""and look at what that gets me."" On the one hand I'm being seen as a woman, which is cool, and on the other that very fact is getting me treated a certain way I don't want. Which is not cool.

I wish we lived in a world where I could say ""that bothers me, please don't support doing that"" and folks would say ""Oh, my bad, I had no idea."" Instead I get guys arguing with me about why I should privilege the intent of guys I don't know and who *initiate* action towards me in the street, rather than, say, have my own feelings and self-respect. Instead I get them struggling to convince me that it's okay and that it doesn't really matter, that I should be flattered I'm an object of desire and sex is the only thing some men can see when they look at me.

It's not a ""compliment about my looks."" I get those from people who say ""Oh I love your hair!"" or ""Wow, where'd you get that dress?"" or ""You look very CEO today, Qeraeth!"" or ""Nice shoes!"" or ""Pearls go great with that blouse"" or ""I like your sexy librarian look""- the thing they all have in common as well (especially that last one) is that they're from people I *know* and trust. The former ones might be said by classmates and colleagues, and come off as tasteful and complimentary. People coming up to me in the street and being lewd, less so.

Arguing about it just compounds the insult. When someone says that something makes them uncomfortable, what I was always taught to do was to, you know, respect that and stop. Not force myself on someone because my privileges matter more than their feelings.","1283306361"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Contrary to the wisdom of the Internet, the body just isn't that dumb.  

Your body has evolved over millions of years to be very good at two things (besides fucking and making babies):

* Surviving through famine and near starvation by storing and then consuming fat during periods where you eat, sleep, and sit around like an oaf
* Becoming strong, lean, and efficient during periods where you are lifting heavy shit, running a lot, and generally active more often than not

It's really that simple.  If you are doing a lot of cardio, your body will burn fat to keep you going, because *that's what it stored it there for in the first place*.

Your body will also *not* consume it's own muscle in order to preserve it's fat stores.  It just won't happen.  There is a natural process of protein turnaround that has been reported by science and then misinterpreted by non-scientists to sell crazy workout programs, supplements and meal replacements, but the truth is: if your body understands it is expected to lift heavier and heavier shit, it will respond by building muscle and protecting it.  It will in fact *consume fat* to preserve the muscle.

If you are running so hard that your heart rate is above normal for a prolonged period of time, your body will understand the fat is slowing you down and would be better used fueling this movement you seem to need to do.

In short, lifting heavy shit will *always* make you strong.  Doing cardio will *always* cause you to shed fat.  Doing both is perfectly fine, and I would 100% advise you to do it.

The extreme shit?  Applies to bodybuilders who need to exceed their genetic capability to put on muscle mass, or those who are trying to cut to obscenely low bodyfat levels.

This makes sense too.  There is no evolutionary benefit to being 5% body fat or carrying 250 pounds of muscle and being able to lift a car.  Consequently, this is going to require extreme measures and a long, drawn out battle with your body, which positively does not want to be in this state.

There *is* a huge advantage to being around 8-10% bodyfat (for males) and reasonably muscular.  And your body really wants you to be in this state, and I guarantee it will be your best friend if this is your goal and you are willing to work with it.","1283306365"

My buddies and I don't sit around telling nigger jokes. The word nigger is not used to refer to black people in any specific way (though if the subject is a black person, so be it). It's used just like dude and bro. IE, ""damn nigger I dropped my donut"" or ""nigger what have you done with the remote?""

My intention is to make that word fair game for everyone including myself. To take it back from racists and give it back to the people. That's what I said in my first comment. That's what I meant then, and I mean it now.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; The two current hot spot examples of this are gay marriage and military service. Roughly speaking, the activism that seeks to include gay men in these realms is, in reality, placing them directly in the crosshairs of corrupt family courts, and on the battlefield, where they can join straight men in being used as the cannon fodder of choice for hegemonic corporatism.

I disagree. For a start, gay men are *already* in the (American) military, closeted, but by choice.  I think war is horrific, but not everything the (American) military does is the result of 'hegemonic corporatism'. Gays want to be able to serve openly, just like everyone else. Whether war is wrong is a separate argument. 

I also think that gay marriage might be the best thing that could happen to marriage right now. In a situation where both partners are the same gender, how can the court system be biased against one partner? Breaking down the nuclear family idea that men = providers and women = nurturers would go a long way to changing the bias in alimony and child support, if only because it forces gender-neutral laws to actually be applied gender-neutral. In a male gay marriage, who is screwed over by the child support laws? 

&gt; It would seem sensible that since marriage, at least in western culture, is a religious institution, that men -all men- push for taking it out of the hands of government completely. Religious institutions would be able to marry whomever they please, which would ensure the rights of almost anyone to marry- and to suffer for it down the road.

Does not compute. Religious institutions are against gay marriage. How would making marriage solely religious ensure the rights of almost anyone to marry?

&gt; In war, the discrimination is against men, from the induction center to Flanders Field. Seeking inclusion in it may well be a human right, but it will ultimately be at the expense of the same. Such is often revealed when taking more than a cursory glance at complicated matters.

What about all the women out there who are fighting to deconstruct the idea that only men are tough enough for the military? Women have no choice in this matter - they don't ""enjoy the militaries strenuous efforts to keep them out of harms way"", they want to be able to recognised as capable soldiers, but they have no choice. It's no surprise to me that gay rights are aligned with feminism in these instances, since the idea that gays aren't ""man enough"" is a pretty pervasive one still.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; The government collects taxes for the provision of services.

Can you provide evidence for this?

&gt; Their sliding scale for the collection of these fees is publicly available, as well as the services the government provides.

Where? How am I bound by this?

&gt;Continuation of the receipt of these services by whatever means you can receive them, coupled with your knowledge of the payment schema for these services, constitutes consent to the contract by the same logic that allows you to get coffee and food in a restaurant without having to sign on a dotted line beforehand.

First of all, I have no knowledge of the payment schema. I have no idea where the money that is taken from me by threat of force from the government goes. Where is the link between taxes and services? Factually, how can you show this?

It is not at all the same as ordering coffee in a restaurant. There a meeting of the minds and mutual exchange of value can be demonstrated by me voluntarily entering the restaurant and asking for coffee. This never happened with the state. I never approached the state and asked for their services. There is no evidence I value these services, so there can be no exchange of value. If they claim what they offer is a service, and I do not agree, then it is not a service. There is no meeting of the minds. You cannot tell me, when I am explicitly telling you otherwise and I have taken no action to contradict my statement, that I value what the government forces me to pay for as a service. If I order a cup of coffee, and then say I'm not paying for it and never wanted it, clearly I am contradicting my previous action of ordering it. There is no way you can show this with the people that call themselves the state, thus you cannot actually show that there is any implicit contract there at all. Inaction cannot signify agreement to anything.","1283306387"

I also noticed your name, like silentdash mentioned, and I thought it was pretty clever ;)  

I'm glad you posted, and I'm sorry to hear that you're having a tough time.  What strikes me about your post is the part where you mention feeling ""invisible to the world"" - that's a terrible way to feel, but it's interesting that it's completely separate from the other depression symptoms you mentioned.  It sounds like you've made great progress by getting in shape, going outside, and going to therapy, but not having many friends or not having someone to spend a lot of time with are different issues than the depression.  Most people are very shy when it comes to meeting new people, so it's hard to make connections, since every person is scared of making the first move!  It's hard to tell if you're still really suffering from the depression part, and if you are, that should be the first priority, but going out and meeting people and putting yourself in situations where you can make friends will be a separate step that you'll need to take.  

Have you ever been in any kind of activity group?  For instance, if you like working out, you could take some kind of class at the gym, and learn how to casually talk to people in the class and maybe even hang out with them in a group.  It's small steps like that that will open your eyes to how to make new friends and connect with people.  Also, if you're clicking well with your therapist, have you brought up these issues with them?  Being depressed and scared usually makes it seem like things are *terrible* and *there's no way this will ever get better*, but sharing your thoughts and getting someone's outside perspective can really help you realize that things aren't the way they seem.

"answers","t5_2qkeh","The dollar is stronger because people have more trust that the US government isn't going to screw the pooch (crazy, eh?). There are of course, some good reasons for this - for example, it wasn't until a few years ago that the Indonesian legislature was anything more than a rubber stamp for the executive. ""Democracies"" where the legislature might as well not exist are ripe for political instability, which leads to economic instability. Thus, if you want to sell me some Rupiah (which is what foreign exchange basically is) so that I can purchase goods manufactured in Indonesia you'll have to take fewer dollars than if you were Germany and I wanted to buy Euros because I see greater risk in holding Rupiah. A lot of people want to believe that currency is something that can have an absolute value - it does not. Like everything else, it's only worth what someone will pay you for it. 

Neither GDP or GNP are really concerned with 'growth.' For example, let's say my child was 4 foot last year and is 4 and a half foot this year. This doesn't mean that they'll be ten foot in 11 years. GDP is just a measure of all the money made domestically within a nation, while GNP is a measure of all the money made by citizens and companies of a particular nation anywhere in the world. Any talking head who tries to project GDP/GNP into the future is probably talking out of their ass. Sure, we can say that ""GDP grew x% this year"" but it really only has descriptive uses, and is not suited to making predictions to help make policy. It's only a small glimmer of everything that is going on which, in total, cause economic growth. ","1283306446"

That is almost as though you were making a point. Yes, many are Christians and Christianity has many sects. That tells you nothing at all about the range of views in the Tea Party. 

&gt;The Left is simply hypocritical because they're afraid of offending Muslims to save their own skin.

Is that really what you think? That *we* are afraid. Funny, from where I sit it looks like the Right in America has been pissing in their pants out of sheer terror. They are so weak that they were willing, no eager, to give up our rights and privileges. So they welcomed intrusive and ineffective airport security. They gave up American justice and were willing to allow 15 year old kids to stay in jail without even the pretense of a trial. And now they are so scared of foreigners that having a mosque in town makes them give up freedom of religion. (Now, yes, I do understand that lost of those folks were not terrible happen with the idea of freedom of religion in the first place.)

I am not afraid of offending Muslims. (According to plenty here I am a flat out Nazi racist when it comes to Arabs. Go figure.) I won't engage in gratuitous insult, I find respect gets me far more. But I won't put up with honor killings or FGM, even in the name of religion. I will object to specific practices I don't like no matter what religion is supposed to be behind them. I will strongly oppose Creationism, for example, whether it is Christian or Islamic. I will object to mistreatment of women whether by Jew or Christian or Muslim. 

What I won't do is announce that 1 billion Muslim are all the same. I won't treat them as though they are all the worst of them. 

&gt;They're happy to manufacture lies about the Tea Party because they represent a threat to their hold on power.

The truths about the Tea Party folk is far worse than the lies. If you want lies and fear of losing power go talk to those are a Tea Party rally. Listen to the birther nonsense. Listen to the garbage about Obama's religion.

"finance","t5_2qhfj","Well, my sister worked for Lehman, which was huge (she didn't work for the real estate side of the business, which is why she got to keep her job when they were taken over by Barclays).  Their clients were mostly big players, but a lot of it was creating new business, which often meant going after other companies that the bank was unfamiliar with.   That was her position, but her clients were almost exclusively Fortune 500.  But yeah, the big banks have their established business, and now that there are only a handful of really big banks, it's hard for even Ivy Leaguers to get those jobs. 

After she left, She* went to a small boutique bank based out of Atlanta, where she has to bring in her own business.  She specializes in startups, so you really have to check them out.  If I were to go into investment banking (and at this point, it's a pretty big ""if""), I'd probably try to get a job with a smaller, regional company.  Since my experience is in health care business/financial processing, I'd probably go after a bank that specialized in that, which according to a link that as supplied earlier, is a growing field.  Case in point, there are six healthcare startups in my office park.

Also, regarding the current economy, even though no one is hiring, a lot of CEOs are sitting on piles of money and their boards are urging them to spend it.  So M&amp;As are through the roof right now.  For example, my company, a huge IT firm, is in a heated bidding war against another huge IT firm for over a storage company.  They're offering billions and they still won't hire a backfill for my old position.  My building has about 6 unfilled positions open...which reminds me.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c"," II Corinthians 5:20, like John 18:36-37 and Philippians 3:20, defines our position by showing that we are not only citizens but also ambassadors of that heavenly Kingdom. We may love  the nation we live in and be subject to its laws and authority, but we must reserve our fullest allegiance for God in heaven and His Kingdom.

Jesus explained what his kingdom is because he wanted to make it clear, that the Kingdom of God has never, and will never be on the earthly realm.  Even argueing the scripture regarding David, going off your information, God told them ""hey you guys dont *have* to have a king, but if you want one here is one.   You've yet to so show me any scripture anywhere that says it is a **sin** to become a leader.  So, I still say the proof is on you.

Jesus telling us the true followers of his kingdom would be hated by the earthly realm **STILL** does not imply even on the most basic terms that becoming a leader is evil.  It doesn't.  What would be evil is choosing your people over God.  

First and foremost though I would like to argue your point that becoming a leader = going to hell. The last time I checked, Salvation meant salvation from all our sins, without an exception to being a leader of a secular nation. 

And I would argue you have a terrible sense of loyalty.  You understand that you can build a heirechy of loyalty right? You're most loyal to God, then to your wife etc etc.  The way you present your arguement is that if you show any loyalty to anything but God (in any amount) you've committed a unforiveable sin.

And lets just say, perhaps, that it is a sin.  Just for a second lets pretend that its a sin to be a leader of a nation on Earth.  How does that mean he is stripped of being a Christian? You don't sin now? You never lust, lie, cheat, steal? Never?  You do covet? You DO commit these sins, we all do.  And guess what? You're still a Christian.","1283306549"

Now, I'm not exaggerating or saying this for effect. It was by far the worst book I've ever read. In my life I must've read a few hundred books and this was the first time I couldn't finish The prose was horrific; it read like something a 13 year old might write. The plan ludicrous...not just far-fetched, actually ludicrous. 
I started looking into things and it turned out James Patterson didn't even write the book. He apparently uses co-authors who do the main draft and he edits, though I don't know how accurate that is.

Air is *pushed* into that inlet from every direction by the ambient pressure - from above, below, the front and the sides. You really don't get any useful thrust from suction for this reason. In the example of the Harrier, there would be approximately no net vertical thrust from the suction at the inlet - it would suck equally from above and below. 

Mostly though, it's because the inlets and outlets aren't in the same place. If the mattress is next to the exhaust it will be blown away, if it's next to the inlet it will be sucked in.","1283306631"

In the right conditions, the vines get huge and unlike most other members of the squash family that you might be used to, they put out fruit in late fall winter, at least here in coastal California. I don't even get flowers until September.

I started there at 28k over two years ago when the economy was at its worst (which they used as an excuse against a raise) - and even now I'm really only at a lower-level entry-level salary.  The real wake-up call was my brother graduating and landing his first job making almost double what I do while doing a somewhat similar job. Nothing like your younger brother making more than you to light a fire under your ass.

Anyway, I'm rambling now - thanks a lot for the advice.  ","1283306659"
"reddit.com","t5_6","100 years ago you probably didn't pay for importing olive oil to deep-fry :-). So unless you live in an area that grows olives, I would bet on lard instead. Delicious :-)

I doubt you'd use vinegar directly, it would make them soggy and then evaporate and be gone. If you want it to stay with the chips when dry, it has to be bound up in something that will release it in water (e.g., in your mouth). Sodium seems like the probable salt, though Potassium might also work. Hopefully it's obvious why you wouldn't want [Rubidium, Cesium](http://www.bestofgooglevideo.com/video.php?video=327), or Fracium :-)

So I suspect the old-timey recipe would be sodium (di)acetate as well, though the ingredients would probably have said baking soda (sodium carbonate) and vinegar. Mix these and you get the classic CO2 volcano, and you're left with sodium acetate, or diacetate if there was enough vinegar. Which, unlike the vinegar alone, will dry out into a powder that tastes like vinegar.","1283306659"

Or perhaps imagine some lonely little kid whos family is poor and his siblings are criminals.  One day his older cousin throws some books on his bed and says ""Here fag, take these books you useless dork.""  Then that kid grows to love those books and he uses them as an escape from his sad lonely existance.  One day he goes off to college on a scholarship that he earned by doing well in school.  Of course on his first day he brings his book collection with him.  He puts them up in his dorm room and he is so happy to have made it away from his abusive criminal family.  He goes on to graduate, with honors, from his university.  He has a wonderfull job lined up so he packs up all of his things and of course his books and gets ready to head out.  His job will take him far far away to an exciting new part of the country.  He is at this point still poor without a car or a place of his own.  Fortunately he has an Aunt who lives not far from his new job.  She has offered to put him up for a while until he gets settled in.  So many wonderfull thoughts and future plans are rushing through his head.  Suddenly he finds himself staring down at his bag of books.  He remembers back to the day he first aquired them.  He still does not know where they came from, but he was certain it was destiny.  His smile grows even larger.  Suddenly he hears the sound of a car horn.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Make it a trading campaign. A small co-op is exploring unknown space to establish trading routes with ETs and perhaps sell the locations of habitable worlds to private or government interests so that colonies might be founded.

Variations might include:

**Exploration of transhumanism:** A member of the crew is effectively killed in a terrible accident. They are reincarnated in a manufactured body by an alien race as a gesture of remorse. They are no longer human and the PCs may now have to deal with the consequences of someone who remembers vividly what it was to be human, but now has different fundamental needs and experiences. Physical sensation, sexuality, the effects of recreational substances, the desire to emulate fellow humans and more are all changed. The PC will need to be very strong willed to hold onto their sanity, and the rest of the party might well be very wierded out.

**Marooned:** Breakdown of a vital system maroons the crew on a pre-interstellar travel world. Their technology is somewhere between superior and vastly superior to that of the locals. How might they cope? The local warlords (or whatever) might be only too happy to kill them and take their toys, or better yet, keep them as slaves milking them for their understanding of advanced matters and interstellar culture. Can they play politics with the local court (where assassination and honor duels are the order of the day) until repairs are made or help arrives?

**First Contact:** A powerful new ET race is discovered, but they have taken offense at some unwitting insult that the PCs have given. Can the PCs work out how they have screwed up and repair the situation before this incredible opportunity is soured forever? Will they make things worse and start a war with a much superior foe? Unreliable translation, cultural barriers and a very alien species might make this very difficult.

**A debt to repay:** Meeting a new people the PCs are greeted with overwhelming hospitality. A lavish party, extravagant gifts and a parade of honor are all pressed onto the crew, including a hold stuffed full of valuable trade goods. Life could not get any better! Until the crew are presented with the bill and told that they now owe a large fortune. If played correctly this situation might result in a valuable new trade partner. If screwed up, humans could be persona non grata and locked out of trade with this culture.

**Military Aid:** The PCs have an opportunity to decide the outcome of a long-running and bloody local war. However the situation is complex and all is not what it seems. The only long term consequences are the players conscience.

Digg ads weren't cutting it. Digg is not like reddit where users welcome the ads and encourage others to make a reddit exception in AdBlock and to sign up for Gold. No, Digg relied solely on ads, and for whatever reasons the community never liked them.

So I think the kind of move Digg pulled in v4 was long in the making and inevitable. Sure, they probably could've done things a lot differently with v4, but in the end, they needed to put business before users (somebody's got to pay for servers and offices and staff, after all) because there wasn't much alternative.

Us users got shafted, yes. But like you said, the target audience has changed, and there's no going back to v3. So let's remember the good things about Digg, try to get over the bad, and move on.

Besides, reddit is way more awesome than Digg. But I would've never known, had this latest Digg fiasco not happened when it did. So goodbye Digg, and hello reddit!","1283306754"

Quebec:

* There are/were some extremely short top ropes/crappy boulder at Ile Ste. Helene.  Crap climbing, blasted rock but been climbed on for years.  Reachable by metro.
* Short sport climbing at Rigaud.   Not great.  30 mins.
* Val-David, trad, mixed, sport, bouldering.  Good climbing mixed in with just a lot of stuff.  Lots of routes, worth checking out for bouldering.  Two or three pitch trad (been a LONG time).  $ if a warden is there and 45 minutes (depending on traffic) drive.   Guide available.
* Montagne d'argent, mixed and sport, 1h15?  haven't been in years.
* Mont Orford, sport, 2nd pitch if you can lead 12 and 13 sport.  A little bit of bouldering. 90 mins?  havent been in a while.

New England: there are plenty of guides available, some online for free.

* McKenzie Pond/Saranac Lake NY, best nearby bouldering, granite quality problems from V2 up to V8. 2 hours but the border (Lacolle) can be a bitch.
* Franconia Notch, Pokoe Moonshine, multipitch, some sport, never been.  Across the border. 
* Smugglers Notch, bouldering, less quality problems, even has some John Gill problems, mid-level bouldering.  2 hours, crossing at VT is usually easier.
* Can't not mention rumney NH (AMAZING sport, a little bouldering), pawtuckaway NH (bouldering)...

Ontario:

* Ottawa has some routes/bouldering with a couple of interesting problems but they are having access issues with the National Capital Commission.
* FAR (8 hours?) but must mention Niagara Glen, AMAZING bouldering on limestone, possible access issues.
* FAR (8 hours?) Bruce Peninsula, Lion's Head (adventure-sport),  White Bluff (short powerful sport), Halfway Dump (bouldering)

Ice: 

Ice climbing I've only done a few times.  Not bad for cardio, way easier than sport or bouldering.  Mixed sounds like it would be cool but I couldn't live with damaging the rock.

* There's a little bit of ice at the McGill basin.  I've only ever seen people ""bouldering"" (ice) there.  15 feet high or something.  
* There's some ice between here and Val-David, single pitch, top-ropable, easy, forget the name.  
* I know at one point montagne d'argent's owner was talking about bringing hoses in, no idea if he ever did it.  
* Montmorency and up there is well known.  The ice world cup goes through Quebec City, look for ""festiglace"".

Protein sequence space is fully explorable by all organisms.

Any given organism can independently evolve any given gene. There is nothing ""unnatural"" about horizontal gene transfer. It happens all the time. This jump is simply larger than others.

&gt;what you could do is work to bring out recessive or dormant genes that would make a crop last better in cold weather

That is not how genetics works.

&gt; perhaps the recent work in eppigeneitcs could allow a cold weather gene in the orange to be activated or you could breed for cold resistant oranges.

That would take an incredible amount of time, and the result would not resemble a orange. Sorry but simply saying epigenetics doesn't open any magical doors. 

Why spend a hundred years and millions of dollars trying to *maybe* improve an orange when you can to the same thing in 3 years using genetic modification?

* Finish reading *Masters of Doom*.
* Pick up and finish at least one fiction book.
* Do a short story for Librivox.
* Write every day.  Even if said writing goes straight into the trashcan, just write *something*.


**Fitness**

* Make at least two four-mile runs during the month.


**Learning**

* Learn the basic ASL grammar, as well as a few common phrases.
* Rewrite the two mobile webapps I recently wrote (an ebook reader and a telnet client) so that they can support multiple users.

**Discipline**

* Write a daily list of tasks at the end of each night.  Do that list the next day.
* Get better at keeping my dream journal.  Last month, this meant putting pen to paper as soon as I woke up.  This month it means re-typing the entries before noon.
* Speaking of noon, being barely employed is no excuse to sleep all day.  Be out of bed, showered, and shaved before noon **every** day.
* Clean out closet.  Throw things out indiscriminately.


I have plenty of spare time to easily finish each one of these tasks.  The question is whether or not I have the follow-through -- which I believe I do.  Now if you'll excuse me, I've got resumes to send out.  Looking forward to having you hound me to stay on task!","1283306840"

They cost just as much to make as a CPU but the price based on product binning doesn't inflate all that much for a perfect chip.

People who try to blame a substance for the behaviours of people are fruity chews.

Whether weed becomes a problem for you depends on your interests &amp; desires. If you are content with your level of intelligence &amp; you value the experience you get when you're influenced by weed, then you've got no reason not to continue smoking it whenever you want.

But who the hell is content with their level of intelligence? It takes more than just intelligence to achieve anything. Having intelligence is like having potential stored up to infinity. And if everything is easy and sweet because of something you're smoking, then you've got no way to tap into those reserves.

That's my issue with this guy. He's a pool of potential but he can't even keep his girlfriend, assuming he wants to. Because if he doesn't care, that changes everything.

I would care if I was that guy though.

My problem isn't that you claim your parents are bad people- I'm sure they are.  My problem is that you insist that if your childhood had been warm and fuzzy, you wouldn't have liked metal music and worn baggy pants and had a rebellious streak.  You know, maybe if your parents had just tried to understand you, you would have had a wonderful childhood and would have had no problem finding yourself and wouldn't have wasted so much time.  OR, you still would have had your rebellious streak and anarchist tendencies and still would have struggled with growing up, because growing up is hard, especially if you're naturally rebellious.  

What I'm saying is, you can dislike them all you want, for as long as you want.  You can disapprove of their ignorance, you can be thankful every day that you're better than them.  And you should.  I'm not trying to be snotty here.  They sound like they suck.  But at some point you should really stop blaming your parents for every hard time you had in your life.  

Also, from your parents' point of view, probably the only thing that kept you from totally and permanently going off the deep end for good was the fact that they were so controlling.  They probably look at you as a pretty normal grown up and say ""Thank God we were so hard on him.  He could really be messed up.  But eventually our efforts paid off and he turned out normal.""

My problem is that I upgraded to 4.0.2 from older firmware (3.2, I think) without realizing it would make it pretty impossible.  I'm jailbroken so I tried installing some apps like TVout and Screensplitter.  Neither have worked.  I get both audio channels but no video with all of the cables I've tried.

Thanks for the link... I might order them just for the hell of it to give it one more shot.

Staring at the same screen all the time is boring and it is an easy way to differentiate your various tile screens. The value added is visual pleasure and differentiation (easy to see which screen you are on)

&gt;need a custom ring tone? 

Either because you don't like the sound if the stock one or you want to use different tones to differentiate between callers. The value added is audio pleasure and differentiation (easy to know whos calling).

 &gt;Why would you need a printer to be available over bluetooth

So you can print? It's the easiest way to print from a mobile and since they support all documents... admittedly I myself find no use for this but that's only because most printer don't support it (if they did, I'd find it useful).

&gt;What use is a barcode scanner when you have a keyboard and can just type in the numbers

Barcode scanner is way easier/faster. 

Now, as for screencap. If you aren't writing documentation, the only use is to try to show off.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;You seem to be an expert in Islamic faith so here is a challenge... Can you give me the context of the following excerpts from the Qur'an and Haddith so I can learn from your knowledge:

Sure, I like these types of challenges, mind if I play too? I think you might be a bit confused though, since none of them are from the Hadith.

&gt; O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.” (Sura 5, verse 51).

I had a [similar discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d47w9/when_will_my_fellow_usamericans_finally_grok_this/c0xh5o0) about this a few days ago.

&gt;“And the Jews say: Uzair is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah DESTROY them; how they are turned away!” (Sura 9, verse 30).

This verse is referring to a specific Jewish tribe in the Arab Peninsula (Saudi Arabia), not all Jews in General. Also, the ""DESTROY"" in all-caps looked a bit suspect, [so I looked the translation up](http://www.islamawakened.com/quran/9/30/default.htm) and it seems that ""qatalahumu"" is also translated as condemn/confound/curse. ""Destroy"" appears only in 6 out of 20 translations as far as I'm concerned.

&gt;“And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the Christians until you follow their religion. Say: Surely Allah's guidance, that is the (true) guidance. And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have no guardian from Allah, nor any helper.” (Sura 2, verse 120).

This verse is aimed at Mohammed, instructing him to stay away from emulating Jews or Christians

&gt;“And KILL them (the unbelievers) wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them; such is the recompense of the unbelievers.” (Sura 2, verse 191).

Discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/cjari/penn_jillette_admits_his_show_refuses_to_go_after/c0y7n6l)

&gt;“Let not the believers take the unbelievers for friends rather than believers; and whoever does this, he shall have nothing of (the guardianship of) Allah, but you should guard yourselves against them, guarding carefully; and Allah makes you cautious of (retribution from) Himself; and to Allah is the eventual coming.” (Sura 3, verse 28).

This alludes to a ""moral alliance"" with unbelievers: that is to say, to an adoption of their way of life in preference to the way of life of the believers, in the hope of being ""honoured"", or accepted as equals, by the former. Since an imitation of the way of life of confirmed unbelievers must obviously conflict with the moral principles demanded by true faith, it unavoidably leads to a gradual abandonment of those principles.

However, as has been made abundantly clear in 60:7-9 that this prohibition of a ""moral alliance"" with non-Muslims does not constitute an injunction against normal, friendly relations with such of them as are well-disposed towards Muslims.

&gt;“And guard yourselves against the fire which has been prepared for the unbelievers.” (Sura 3, verse 131)

*3:130: ""O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful.""* 3:131 makes more sense in context after reading 3:130 - 3:131 is one of several repetitive verses, probably placed after 1:130 to remind usurers of their possible punishment.

&gt;“And when you journey in the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve will cause you distress, surely the unbelievers are your open ENEMY.” (Sura 4, verse 101).

In context, this verse merely affirms the permissibility of shortening the prayer during travel, war, or out of fear of an incoming attack.

&gt;“O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness; and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil).” (Sura 9, verse 123).

""the unbelievers who are near to you"" refers to Meccan pagans who were at war with the Muslims in 625 AD. This verse urges the Muslims of Medina to face the Meccans firmly so that they don't think that the Muslims are weak.

&gt;“Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains and shackles and a burning fire.” (Sura 76, verse 4).

This verse is related to the two preceding verses (see 4:74-75) where it was stated that those who fight for God’s cause would be rewarded whether they are victorious or slain. Fighting for God’s cause includes the liberation of the oppressed, meaning the helpless men and women who are yearning and praying for freedom. The believers fight for God’s cause, and the disbelievers fight for the sake of their idols. An idol may be taken conceptually. For example, evil or greed may figuratively be construed as idols. The believers should put all their trust in God the Almighty and Powerful and fear not the disbelievers and their evil plans. Evil plans are always inferior to goodness.

&gt;“O you who believe! if you obey a party from among those who have been given the Book (The Jews and Christians), they will turn you back as unbelievers after you have believed.” (Sura 3, verse 100).

The context becomes a lot more clearer if you read the verse before it:

*3:100: Say: O followers of the Book! why do you hinder him who believes from the way of Allah? You seek (to make) it crooked, while you are witness, and Allah is not heedless of what you do.*

&gt;“And their taking usury (interests on money) though indeed they were forbidden it and their devouring the property of people falsely, and We have prepared for the unbelievers from among them a painful chastisement.” (Sura 4. verse 161).

4:161 refers to Jews who commited usury in 4:160:

*4:160 Because of the wrongdoing of the Jews We forbade them good things which were (before) made lawful unto them, and because of their much hindering from Allah's way*

&gt;“Surely Allah has cursed the unbelievers (Jews, Christians and followers of other faiths) and has prepared for them a burning fire.” (Sura 33, verse 64).

After looking at [all the translations of this verse](http://www.islam-muslims.org/Quran/33/64/default.htm), I didn't see a single one referring to unbelievers as Jews or Christians. Searching for that exact string yielded a bunch of nutty Neoconservative blogs, from where I assume you picked that one up. ""Believers"" (Mu'men) are generally understood to be all people who believe in God (which include all adherents of Abrahamic faiths), so the note in the parantheses doesn't even make sense.

&gt;“And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Apostle, then surely We have prepared burning fire for the unbelievers.” (Sura 48, verse 13).

48:13 refers to the Bedounis in 48:11 and 48:12 who lied and wished for Muslims' demise during the war with the pagan tribe of Quraysh:

*48:11 ""The desert Arabs who lagged behind will say to thee: ""We were engaged in (looking after) our flocks and herds, and our families: do thou then ask forgiveness for us."" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: ""Who then has any power at all (to intervene) on your behalf with God, if His Will is to give you some loss or to give you some profit? But God is well acquainted with all that ye do. ""*

*48:12 ""Nay, ye thought that the Apostle and the Believers would never return to their families; this seemed pleasing in your hearts, and ye conceived an evil thought, for ye are a people lost (in wickedness).""*

My sister's Down Syndrome has affected us her whole life and basically mine as well since she's only a year younger. The stroke made her more irritable and caused her to start hitting. So that really strains our family when she gets in moods. My oldest sister's death really brought us together in a way my mom and sisters have never been. It was nice, but it didn't last. My mother is very stubborn, all of this affects her a lot, but she doesn't do anything to deal with it. This pisses me and my older sister off. Her anger is lashed out on us. We've dealt with our issues, she refuses to see anyone or talk to ANYONE[me and my sister included] about how she feels. My sister's heart problem affects us once in a blue moon. We[her husband and my mom and I] just have to keep an eye on her. She likes to be super mom, but at times, it's a physical impossibility.

The most influential in my life? Jeez. The death of my sister and my little sister's Down Syndrome are pretty even. It's like comparing a long term ache to a quick, intense stab.

My oldest sister had a lot of issues actually. Mostly mental, though. She was bipolar, but it was easily controlled with meds. She was also big into hard drugs from a pretty young age. Was in rehab a lot when she was younger. It was like our family's dirty little secret. I didn't even know until ~4 years ago. OD about 10 years ago, was in the hospital for a week after.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Actually national wages have gone up since the early 70's, even adjusted for inflation (according to income figures received from http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/AWI.html and inflation figures from both http://www.inflationdata.com/inflation/Inflation_Calculators/Inflation_Rate_Calculator.asp and http://www.westegg.com/inflation/)

The real problem is that things like houses and insurance rates are increasing much much faster than the rate of inflation. Houses in particular have increased almost 900% from 1970 to 2004 (http://www.realestateabc.com/graphs/natlmedian.htm) despite an inflation index of only 390% during the same period. Largely due, in my opinion, to the fact that there are 100 million more people in the US now than in 1970.

Some other services have also far outpaced inflation during the same time, such as college tuition (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_tuition).

The fact is, the old American dream of 2 kids and a house with a big back yard and a walk in closet simply isn't affordable to a lot of middle class America anymore. I think the cause lies with the fact that there are just too many of us for the necessary house to be affordable to the average joe (or jane). It's the quest for this dream that got us into the sub-prime loan crisis, and made it so easy for the big banks to trick people into buying houses they simply couldn't afford.

If women were to stop entering the work force wages for men would certainly go up. You could go back to being the sole bread winner and having a wife at home, but it wouldn't make that house more affordable, and it wouldn't make your kid's college tuition any more affordable.

I understand that they have their side of the story, and these are unique individuals, not all of them are liars, but the ones who are are VERY good at it. We go through classes specifically designed to give us the mental tools we need to protect ourselves from being conned, but when the general public hears about an inmate saying how bad a time he's having in prison, they are inclined to believe him. Nevermind the story that the newspapers print a week later saying that all allegations were proven to be false by outside investigation (which happen a lot, usually needlessly), they've already focused on the information that supports their negative view of corrections in general.

I'm sorry if any of that offended you as a journalist. I'm sure you understand how I feel though. It seems like people might be pretty quick to assume that you are the same as the worst in your field. *coughFOXcough*","1283307083"

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","I eat a ton of steak. It's always grass-fed, I can't eat regular steak anymore. It's just not as good, in my opnion. I make it like this;

* Preheat oven to 350F.
* Pop in steak on a rack. ""Cook"" till it's a little over 105F (This usually takes between 10-16 minutes depending how thick the steak it, I check on it 2 or 3 times in the process), have your pan heating at a pretty high temp. I put mine right above the middle of the ""Hi"" and ""Med"" nob (vague, sorry).
* Put a tablespoon or so of Olive Oil in the pan..(I use my eye, sorry, vague again.)
* Pull out the steak. Salt and Pepper the top and put that side down first. Salt and Pepper the next side while it's in the pan.
* Cook about 2 minutes per side, if it's really thick hold it with tongs and get a little sear on the sides too..if you want. It should be right around 140F after 2 minutes per side unless it's seriously thick (1 and a half inch steaks would be done by then)
* Tent it and let it rest for 10 minutes..if you can wait that long.

Sorry this is vague and not really an ideal set of instructions, but it was more meant to give you the idea of how I do it. I make a steak literally almost every night. I get 20 pound pieces and butcher it myself. This is the best way I've tried, and I've tried everything besides soude-whatever-I don't want to know the name because I can't afford it.

EDIT: I also know about the smoking point of Olive Oil and you shouldn't use it for this and all that...but I can't order steak anywhere anymore because mine is better, so I'm not changing how I do it anymore. I've tried other oils, butter, marg..just rather use olive oil. Personal preference.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Inline is all about stickhandling. Since there's less contact (I've always been pretty short, so I've leveled a couple of guys without the refs calling anything as long as they were clean hits), players get away with keeping their heads down and focusing on the puck.

It makes for guys who can do more flashy stuff, but it's the guys who play both that really dominate inline games. They come back with harder shots and a much better hockey sense since they're looking around to avoid getting hit when playing ice.

That being said, having only played inline I scratch my head when people ask things like ""can you toe drag?"" It's pretty much the most basic deke anyone ever learns and I honestly didn't even know there were people who couldn't just do it until a few years ago. I knew a kid who flipped the puck over and behind him, flattened his skate/boot horizontally, kicked the puck up and forward over two opposing players, and took off at full tilt only to have the puck land right on his stick on the other side of the two guys. Same guy could snipe a corner on a breakaway with a golf swing.

Unfortunately, being put in gold didn't really help me get better teammates... in fact, I think some of them play WORSE.

You're correct that Beck does include some useful information - e.g., the role of the Second Amendment - but he does so in such a cursory and breezy manner, and then *follows the legitimate points with the crazy ones*, that I stand by my original point.

In all honesty, I think your last point - ""Gun ownership is . . ."" - is too generous an interpretation/summation of his arguments.  It's a legitimate point, and one with which I agree, but I think you're giving him more credit than he deserves in making the argument and not having it lead to absurd places.  Normally, I'm all for reading/debating generously, as it's part of fruitful discussion, but it becomes especially difficult regarding Beck's situation.

Edit: adding a little more below.

I'm willing to admit that at least some portion of my problem with Beck's actual literary style may be grounded in my own situation; to continue with the Second Amendment example, I agree that the Amendment was intended to prevent outright tyranny by the federal government, but felt that he gave an unsatisfactorily one-sided account of the debate as to its meaning.  I realize that saying ""Just read *Heller* and think about it for your own damn self"" wouldn't have been a good way to sell books, but his arguments failed to impress, even when I recall largely agreeing with his conclusion before reading the book.

This seemed to be a continuing theme throughout the book: he would set up an argument, clearly favoring his pre-existing conclusion from the beginning, and then proceed to reach that conclusion through a shifty combination of strawmen, legitimate points, and hand-waving.

An example that I believe I recall correctly (because god knows I can't be bothered to go get the book, *I'm internetting*!): Beck compared the educational budgets of New York and Utah with their respective educational outcomes, and pointed out that Utah obtains better results despite spending less money overall (and, I believe, less money per student).  What did he suggest the reader take away?  That *more government spending isn't always the answer*.  A legitimate point, but through an example so devoid of nuance (comparing demographics, educational styles, etc.) as to make it outright frustrating to read.

 I doubt that I'm alone in finding it annoying to be subjected to such tactics.  For me, such an abundance of crap buried the few points that were actually worth reading, and even those points are contained elsewhere in better logic/discussions and less condescension disguised as plain talk.","1283307151"

"wow","t5_2qio8","I am going for doing as many quests as I can, but I am not really concerned about Loremaster. If I get it, I get it. If I don't, I don't. I am doing it to see stories I may have missed over the past five years. 
However, some of what I have to say will still apply.

1. Everyquest and Loremaster. Get them. And, as recommended by Virikk, it is best to go zone by zone. That's the most EFFICIENT way, but it sometimes isn't the most fun way. Sometimes I take a more organic approach and just take quests as I see them and do them, no matter where I end up. As you can see from my quest log in my earlier submission today, my quest log is full of all kinds of random shit. But if time is an issue, definitely do an entire zone and move on. 

2. Play music or watch a movie while you do this. Some zones are extremely boring. I hate to say it, but it's true. 

3. When you notice that you are beginning to get bored - STOP. If you don't, burnout will set in. Being level 80 while beating the shit out of level 35 mobs just isn't fun in any way shape or form. Take a break, play an alt, come back later. Having to use your ground mount when you're used to whipping around on your epic drake can also be a buzz kill. So don't try your patience. When you've killed all of the tigers for Nesingwary that you can stand, go out to the movies and then jump on your boyfriend/girlfriend.

4. Really try to get into the quest as best you can. Okay ""Go get me bat meat for my bat-kabobs"" isn't an interesting quest, but there are some very intricate stories out there also.

I honestly am apolitical when it comes to the Rep/Dem side of things. I am registered as no party affiliation. I research the candidates and issues that will appear on my ballot and I do my own homework. I launched this video really expecting to see someone accosting people, vomiting up obscure figures and other nonsense, but was pleasantly surprised to see nothing of the sort. For almost the entire thing, the interviewer *listened.* He asked why they were attending, asked about the concerns, and *let them talk.* Yes, he did ask about the Islamic center. Yes, he did ask about Beck's racism comment. I don't see how either would be inappropriate. I would expect him to ask Democratic rally attendees about troop withdrawal and Guantanamo Bay. I wouldn't think those were inappropriate either. 

I think (and this is solely my opinion) that a large part of the people who associate with Beck, Fox, etc. have a deep-seated distrust of younger people, *especially* if they're asking questions related to politics.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","I wouldn't call them death traps because one is not in them as one is in a car, but calling them death magnets is accurate. Riding a bike is dangerous. Ain't no way around that. Depending on how you ride it can be much more dangerous or a little less dangerous. Today I was almost in an accident. And yesterday, and last week, and... people's driving is getting worse and it is getting more dangerous. A friend of mine said years ago his life was threatened every other time he rode. Now it is every time. 

Imagine a three lane intersection onto a main six lane highway. Two lanes turn left, one serves straight and right turns. I am heading north waiting to turn west, a left turn. I am in the middle of the three lanes. One car ahead of me, with some guy on a cell phone. To my left are two cars and another motorcycle. One car to my right. The light changes. The two cars to my left pull out, the car in from of me doesn't. The guy is fiddling with his cell phone. The car to my right turns right.  Then the car in fromt of me starts to go, as do I. Suddenly there is the scream of many tires grabbing tar. The car in front of me is swerving right, the two cars to my right are swerving my way. A pick up truck in the closest highway lane did not stop for the light. Even though he's skidding into the intersection sideways he's not a threat to me yet but it's the cars trying to get out of his way that are going to run me over. Even though they threaten me they are also running interference so I dip right and punch it heading for the open space of the empty lanes to my right. The other motorcycle stopped where he was. 

Brakes, reflexes and torque worked and there was no accident. THAT happens all the time. Bikes are dangerous but the other drivers are more dangerous. You can't just ride. You have to actively avoid all the time. ","1283307184"

I think the reason for this is that alcohol is deeply rooted in our society's norms (e.g. turning 21 is a very important milestone in many people's lives.

I think the main reason pot is so negatively viewed is because they have not tried it. I met a couple of guys at college who firmly believed pot should remain illegal, but could cite no evidence to support their case. I believe they used all or most of the previous points I talked about, and one of them cited a study they read that found ""marijuana disrupts brain waves over short-term use.""

Wrong.

&gt; That's all that really matters. 

Wrong. Astrologers have great replication rates -- their results agree very well, but astrology is not a science. Also, if you really understood science you would have said ""replicable"", not ""reproducible"", even though it's still the wrong answer. The reason? Reproduction is the repeat of a study. Replication is the *successful* repeat of a study that comes to the same conclusion.

And replication cannot hold a candle to the real single most important property of a scientific theory.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Lots of gay men and women go through this. Lots of gay people have historically raised families with members of the opposite sex, including marriage, etc. If you choose to lead that kind of life, that's your choice.

Do realize, however, if you are actually gay, those feelings will likely resurface later. I'm guessing you're in high school? Don't make any life-long assumptions while you're in high school. Things change, and they change *fast*. Almost nothing anyone over 25 thought to be Fact(tm) in high school still applies to their lives now.

It may make it easier while in such a piss-poor environment like HS to pretend or whatever. If you haven't selected a college, I might suggest picking one away from family by a sizable distance. Go on a few dates with guys, a few with girls, and see what interests you.

What you shouldn't do is wait until you're 40, married, with three kids to figure out ""hey.. I like men, fuck you, bitchwife, I want a divorce!"" That's not fair to anyone.

You may want to look into local LGBT groups, depending on how large a city you live in. When I was coming out, they were a fantastic resource. Just being able to hang out with other guys and girls that are going through the same shit was fantastic. There were a *lot* of questioning people that showed up, too.

Also, realize that the stereotypes you see from bigots about gay people are mostly unfounded. Not all of us are whores, not all of us have STDs, not all of us have a lisp, not all of us enjoy pride events, not all of us hit bars and clubs every weekend.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","actually, they're two discrete concepts that evolved independently of each other, but both fall under the category of orthography. 

capitalization's roots are partially-based on the medium it was being used (e.g. chiseled vs handwritten). the rules of its usage have changed several times over the years. punctuation wasn't affected by its medium until the press came along — and now we have pointless rules for things like quote marks that are entirely dictated by the types of presses used at the time... which vary from country to country. anyway, my point is: they're not the same thing.

with modern punctuation, capitalization becomes a mere formality... and, therefore, unnecessary for informal communication. there's also an ongoing debate as to whether or not the eye scans all-lowercase letters more easily — mostly because lowercase letters' descenders/ascenders make for a more easily distinguished shape.

...so... yeah. fuck off. thanks :D

&gt; I've been here longer than you.

so... you've been here 6 mos and you think you're hot shit, eh? well, let me tell you something: this is, at least, my 7th account. if reddit didn't piss me off so much, my first account (FishPoisonCon) would be 4 years old in 2 months. i remember when they *added* the sub-reddits... i also remember the fry incident. do you even know what that was? if you weren't such a newfag you'd know reddit was known for how easy it was to sign up for (it still is, but...) and that most older redditors have several accounts, even if they're currently only using one. it was actually kind of a problem for a while — which is why i made a habit of deleting my accounts so i wouldn't be accused of sock puppet shows. in other words: *GTFO my lawn!*

oh, btw: wtf is up with the majority of your comments being one sentence? considering how few upvotes they get, i'm not sure what motivates you. you bitch about capitalization an awful lot (2 typos on pg 2, btw). at least my comments force people to think a little (or in your case, actually learn stuff), even if it's only because they're pissed off.

"Learnmusic","t5_2rgto","Acoustic pianos have 88 keys, if you want to learn classical music (which is a good idea because it develops good technique, you can find lessons almost anywhere, and there is a huge pool of free public domain music) get a ""digital piano"" that has 88 weighted keys.

Beyond number of keys, there are different kinds of ""key weight"" or ""key feel,"" ranging from weighted to semi-weighted to unwieghted, or synth-action.  Keyboards marketed as ""digital pianos"" are meant to emulate real acoustic pianos and thus have keys that approximate the feel of real piano keys.  Besides classical, they are good for jazz, R&amp;B, some kinds of rock, etc. Yamaha and Roland are excellent brands and have a wide range of prices to fit your budget.  If you can, try out an acoustic piano to compare to a digital piano.

Most products marketed as ""keyboards"" will have either semi-weighted or unweighted keys.  They typically come with 49, 61, or 72 keys.  It's next to impossible to play classical music on these, very hard to play most pre-1960s jazz styles, and can be hard to play certain R&amp;B songs.  That said, they are excellent for any electronic genre of music and many other genres as well (techno, metal, progressive rock/metal, jazz fusion).  There are far too many brands to mention, but do look for a ""synthesizer"" because it will have sounds onboard, ready to go.  Products labeled as ""controllers"" or ""MIDI controllers"" rarely have onboard sounds and require an external synthesizer.  

Finally, (I know, TL;DR) try to stay away from the low end Casio and Yamaha ""beginner"" keyboards that cost around $200 (US).  These are annoyingly frustrating to play, break easily, and often have smaller than normal keys.  If you splurge for a slightly more expensive keyboard of quality, you can always resell it, but no one wants a broken casio with cheesy drum machine sounds.

edit: almost forgot, it's pretty easy to find a good digital piano with integrated speakers, but most keyboards will require an amp.","1283307304"

His response was, however, more or less him saying a big fuck you to all his fans because they are his characters and he could do what he wants with them. This was on his front page until he deleted it and kicked people off the forums for mentioning it. The guy is a baby,  who should have ignored everyone and continued with what he wanted to do.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Steel cases don't open up to fill the chamber as well as brass cases do. This can leave some soot on the chamber walls. This soot can behave like an adhesive and inhibit extraction.

What you might want to do is buy yourself a extractor upgrade from a vendor like Sprinco (tactical springs) or BCM. This might give you a little more oomf when it comes to grabbing the occasionally potentially stuck case. 

My piston gun used to mangle rims (I sold it and went back to DI) and my 21 year old Mini-14 absolutely destroys brass (I won't sell it, since it was a 16th bday present). 

One last thing, You might want to take a felt polishing bit and some jeweller's rouge and give the chamber a bit of a polish. This technique works in other weapons very well and I can't see how the AR and Mini-14 would be any different.","1283307376"

Of course, your situation is far more fucked up than just that. There are many different factors going on in your situation. You and your sister both clearly lack the self esteem to be with men your age, something desperately wrong also happened while you're growing up; some serious mommy/daughter issues going on that absolutely must be sorted.

If you have the resources, I would look into some professional counseling so that you might have an opportunity to dig these old issues up and discuss them in order to achieve a resolution. The purpose of this is for the sake of any children you may have in the future, and you should be extremely thankful you're 25 years old and have managed to have no children yet. It is your responsibility to break the cycle of mental illness which has been imparted upon you by your family.

I do not have enough words to fully type out effective advice here beyond that. Your situation may seem relatively simple, and taken as a series of facts it may be kind of simple even though it is pretty bizarre..

Frankly, I've been being a bit of a troll, but all I'm really saying is this:

The market self-regulates and innovates, it is currently in the act of doing so. As we begin to run out of fossil fuels, we'll have no choice but to adapt to that change. 
Maybe we'll build some nuclear plants and start using the energy in electric tractors, the details aren't important. Market forces (scarcity of land, labor, continually increasing population) will manifest as change.

I highly doubt that change will be discarding the last hundred years of agrochemical/industrial technologies and/or widespread revived interest in more labor-intensive food production, for obvious reasons. We may out of oil, but we won't run out of mouths to feed.

The less informed proponents of the organics movement take irrational fear of agrochemicals and GM crops, etc., and fret about where their food comes from in a way that I can't tolerate. Fear of a threat should be proportional to that threat. A majority of people do not die because they eat cheap produce.

I understand that modern agriculture relies on fossil fuels, however, so does most of modern life. I find a pro-organic, yet otherwise modern lifestyle to be hypocritical and obnoxious. I understand that fossil fuels will decrease in availability over time, that's fine, we have other terrestrial energy sources. Ultimately we will have to rely entirely and directly upon solar power, until that time, we should take advantage of our resources (even non-renewable ones) to sustain, as much as possible, the quality of human life for everyone.","1283307412"

Then I scraped it as hard as I could up and down my left thigh until I made deep runnels.  Before I did that, I was hysterical, crying, and crouched on the floor wondering how best to kill myself while making it look like an accident.
I'm serious.
After hurting myself, I calmed down.  I laid down on the bed and just stared at the ceiling fan.  My brain was occupied with the physical pain in my leg and no longer cared so much about my emotional pain.
It's a habit I've had since middle school.  I KNOW it's bad for me, but I HAVE to do it to keep myself sane and alive, sometimes.

I'm not foregoing their works to make a point, I just can't enjoy their work anymore. I can see every little thing they've tried to subtlety throw in that supports their bigoted viewpoints. It's hard not to notice that every single protagonist is a WASP, and that every antagonist or just shitty person in general is a minority. Or that you place themes that are a metaphor for the coming dark age science is going to bring upon us, for our minds can't handle it and the knowledge will drive us insane. Subtlety is the key here, and in some stories it's much harder to see than others, which is why used the examples I did. To the unsuspecting eye neither of these author's work come across that way, but under closer scrutiny really do show their tendencies and prejudices.

Sure it doesn't make you less of a writer, in fact I'd argue it might even make them better writers than most for being able to separate their works from their beliefs that well. But after learning things like that, going back and reading it again, it's all I can see.","1283307485"

These people after all are not the enemy and could potentially be helpful. When you act like this you are pushing them away when you could be bringing them together. I do understand though that many of them are just idiots that shouldn't be down there. You have all these people down there ""protesting"" for whatever pet cause they have picked up that has NOTHING to do with the g20. 
What do you think about property damage though? I myself am not necessarily against it, but again simply for the sake of discussion. What exactly do you feel you will accomplish through the smashing of store windows and such? Don't you think that in many ways it is the working men and women who are hurt by this? I just think that the aggression directed at other protesters as well as the damaging of property might just further alienate other working people from the anarchist movement, when we should be getting as many people as possible to embrace it.

The only thing i don't know is in you say break arms...in a situation with multiple people we are taught that breaking things like knees and arms gets one attacker out of the way i would assume its the same...but we are normally taught when its a single opponent breaking is less effecient than keeping pressure on a joint and controlling.

On McKibben's essay:

Notice how he constantly says ""on record"" as if that means a damn thing. Our records don't go very far back. 

This point is quite troubling:

&gt;* A “staggering” new study from Canadian researchers has shown that warmer seawater has reduced phytoplankton, the base of the marine food chain, by 40% since 1950.

I would like to see what scientists think will happen as a result though. 

What is interesting is how a large chunk of his argument focuses on the possible impact that global warming might have on the seas, while ignoring that we've been poisoning our seas for roughly a century (there's a good documentary about all the plastic in the sea out there).

http://washingtonindependent.com/74033/the-four-month-supermajority
Democrats [..] will have had a working 60-seat majority for all of four months — much of which was spent with the Senate in recess. They opened the Congress in January with 58 votes, counting the ailing Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), not counting Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), whose razor-thin victory was held up by lawsuits from former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.). On April 28, 2009, Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pa.) switched to the Democratic Party, bringing the Democrats to 59 votes without Franken. When Franken was finally sworn in on into the Senate on July 7, 2009, the badly ailing Kennedy was unable to vote and break filibusters. Kennedy died on Aug.25, 2009, but it took Massachusetts Democrats — who run every aspect of their state government — a full month to pass legislation seating a replacement, Sen. Paul Kirk (D-Mass.). He took office on Sept. 24, 2009. Only then, and only depending on whether Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) was well, did the Democrats have a supermajority.","1283307524"
"politics","t5_2cneq","Men were abandoning their families in significant numbers before the first welfare check was written. The Great Depression put terrible strain on families, breaking some of them. Men abandoned their families to look for work, or because they were ashamed they could not find work. Marriage rates in the 1930s dropped for the first time since the early 1800s. Economic strain without a safety net destroys families. 

Any political ideology or proposal that erodes the safety net (welfare, food stamps, unemployment benefits, medicaid, etc) is an accomplice in destroying traditional families. Families are the foundation of civilization, the cornerstone on which every other advancement and institution was built (look at the most successful people, where would they have gotten without their family?). Take a jackhammer to that cornerstone like those who want to get rid of the safety net are doing and everything built on top of it will crumble. 

Those who would destroy the safety net are a threat to individuals who lose a job, get sick, get old, a threat to their families and a threat to civilization itself. ","1283307524"

How the hell did you come to that determination?

They're Israelis alright. Religious, influential, Israelis at that.

How you could pronounce rabbi Yitzak Shapira (the author) and rabbi's Yaakov Yosef, Dov Lior (two, amongst many Israeli rabbis who wholeheartedly endorsed the racist work) as not being Israeli.

Not to mention rabbi Ovadia Yosef, who openly called for the muder of all Palestinians. If they weren't Jews you'd be calling them anti-Semites.

Edit: That my truthful comments would be down-voted isn't surprising. Neither is the collective delusional behavior of Israels most vocal supporters. However, you considerably weaken your ability to argue your points and remain credible by insisting that some rather well known rabbi's  are not Israeli. Again, I'm not surprised. But this is consciously stupid.
While I'm sure you're inconvenienced by the fact they're from Israel, lying about it isn't the way to deal with the issue.

Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. 

I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic?

Lance and Cecil, a young gay couple on vacation, walk into an unfamiliar bar.  The two find a table in the corner where they can be inconspicuous while getting a sense of their environment. Lance suggests, ""Hey, Cecil, why don't you get us a drink.""

Cecil obligingly approaches the bar and awaits the attention of a barkeep.  The gruff bartender says with no sign of respect, ""What'll it be?""

Cecil replies, ""Oh, I dunno, something with gin.""  Pausing momentarily to size Cecil up, the bartender responds ""Around here we've only got three kinds of *gin*:  Oxy*gin*, hydro*gin*, and nitro*gin*, and we don't take kindly to your kind.""

Cecil retreats to the corner and, nearly in tears, explains to Lance what has just happened.  Lance, incensed and appalled, stomps up to the bar.

""Bartender!  Give me a gin!""

""Like I told your butt-buddy - 'round here, we've only got three kinds of *gin*.  Oxy*gin*, hydro*gin*, and nitro*gin*.""

The last case is probably the closest to what you're thinking of, but it doesn't exactly fit, either, because you're talking about measuring two different properties.

In general, I think that something can't be measured to have two different values simultaneously, except maybe in different frames of reference. In quantum superposition, something has all possible values, *until it's measured*. So, the way the question is phrased, ""Can a quantity be measured,"" implies that a value is selected and it's no quantum-ly superimposed.

While it was the case that most PT schools used to be 2-3 years, APTA (American Physical Therapy Association) wants all accredited institutions to have removed their masters programs and only offer doctorates in PT by 2020 ( [Vision 2020](http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Vision_20201&amp;Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=285&amp;ContentID=32061) ). As a result more and more programs are shifting to a 3-4 year program. Currently, UM has a [3 year program](http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?section=CAPTE3&amp;template=/aptaapps/accreditedschools/acc_schools_map.cfm&amp;process=2&amp;ProgramID=1583997B-AF85-490B-B9F3-84F20E4286EB), so by the time you will apply it will probably still be only 3 years.

I have read a 3 lb. book of rules for every single post I have ever worked at my institution, which is a substantial number. The guidelines I am expected to adhere to are very clearly set down and very effective when followed. If not followed, disciplinary action is taken.

I think this really hits the nail on the head. In my experience, inmates very much want rules, or at least thrive with them. The only catch is that guards have to have rules too, and whether or not there are (effective) rules varies from prison to prison. And I think bad guards attract other bad guards, so the guys you say don't last long would stick around if they got to act like guards in movies.","1283307733"

Thus the natural color of the cheese varies over the course of a year. So cheese makers began adding coloring agents...Dyeing the cheese eliminated seasonal color fluctuations and also played to the fact (or anyway the belief) that spring/summer milk had a higher butterfat content than the fall/winter kind and thus produced more flavorful cheese. Figuring if yellow = good, orange = better, some cheese makers began ladling in the annatto in double handfuls, producing cheese that looked like something you'd want to carve into a jack-o'-lantern.","1283307736"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Reality check?

Digestion burns MAYBE 5% of the overall calories consumed.  For a 500 calorie meal -- big heavy one -- what is that, 25 calories?

500 calorie processed food meal then is half of that, according to the study.  12 calories versus 25 per meal.  For normal people, eating whole foods will burn around 30-50 extra calories.

I'm estimating like crazy here, so forgive me.

Is that statistically relevant or interesting?  Yeah, for the purposes of a study, sure.  For you, trying to lose weight?  Not so much.

There are a ton of good reasons to eat whole foods versus processed crap, and the processed crap is going to wreak havoc on your system to a degree that dwarfs the 40 calories you aren't burning by eating it.

Sorry for the rant.  I'm just a little annoyed when these studies get press and then people run with the minor, practically insignificant results and start altering their diet or exercise routine as a result.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I am sorry you are trapped in such a difficult situation, and I believe you came to the right subreddit for advice (as I'm sure many here have dealt with similar situations).  However, I would encourage you to be understanding and moderate in how you approach this situation, which may differ from some of the other opinions here.

Try to remember that it is perfectly ""natural"" for humans to adopt the prevailing beliefs in their society and even cling to those beliefs in the face of contradiction.  You mother is not a gay Christian for the fun of it, but because of genetics and social pressures.  Even your ex and her parents are the product of their environment and likely have little incentive to challenge and break those prejudices.

I am not trying to excuse their behavior by any means.  Instead, I want to encourage you to help your mother come to terms with her lifestyle by being supportive and walking her through (baby steps) that process.  Even if she simply becomes a slightly more tolerant and open minded Christian (""maybe god doesn't hate fags, but loves me and others for who they are""), it will be an improvement.  Nothing aggressive, just loving support plus bits of information as she seems receptive to such things.

As for your ex, I am assuming you have no problems directly between you since you are both Christian.  If you really care for her, I would advise a similar process of at least trying to get her to come to accept your mother for who she is, and hopefully no longer involve her parents in the issue at all.  However, if that is not an option, your ex and her parents are the ones at fault, they are the ones acting unethically.  As such, if they refuse to tolerate your mother, and by extension you, you really must stand up for what is right and support your mother.

It may be hard leaving behind your girlfriend, but honestly if she cannot come to terms with this issue, you are much better off.","1283307744"

On the other side, we see those who see the problem as a developmental issue, and know that a ""name brand"" coach will only do as much as Bradley has done because they will have shared a (lets be honest and call it shallow) talent pool. Having said ""brand name"" coach only do as well as the previous American coaches will be seen as a failure of the most epic proportions, and future high profile names will never think twice about turning the job down.

I thought it was actually a stroke of genius on John Byrne's part to revamp Luthor as a rich business mogul who wields enormous power through his wealth, as opposed to the pre-Crisis mad scientist Luthor.  Fighting Superman physically is a losing battle, he's far too powerful, and punch out after punch out with the monster of the week eventually gets boring.  Luthor can use his money to fuck with Superman endlessly and pull his illegal activities and cover his tracks well enough that Superman can't charge him with anything, which in and of itself Superman finds frustrating and demoralizing.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","&gt;predict (say by an interval) another observation

Here is our difference. Prediction involves estimating a new value for a phenomenon. The mean could be considered a prediction because in the absence of any other information, the mean is the best predictor of a new value from a distribution. But that is a trivial *prediction* in that it isn't any more than a description of what you already have.

All those intervals are statistical comparisons not predictions.

I guess my philosophy on statistics is that people, perhaps inadequately trained, already use them all the time. My mission is to try to nudge those people into searching out information to learn more about what they are doing or preferably, plan to do. Flowcharts and blogs are simple enticements to further study. Perhaps more important, though, is leading people towards more quantitative approaches in our world chocked with data. A misapplied statistical technique is frustrating but it is correctable because the intention to find quantifiable solutions already exists. Convince the boss who ""doesn't need numbers to manage because he been doing without them his whole career."" That's a formidable challenge. Any movement in the correct direction is good even if it's not perfect.","1283307873"

A) Starting Strength, google it, because I'm too lazy to link it. It's a program, but it is also a book about how to do the exercises (squat, deadlift, press, bench, clean)

B) Gallon of milk a day on top of a big diet. You can eat fast food burgers, which are heavy in calories, but don't the fries and soda won't do much for you. If you are worried about putting on too much fat, stagger it. Drink a gallon of milk a day for a month, eat normal for 2 months, then do it again, until satisfied. I

Now, the reason your program doesn't work is because it is too much work for one day, and too much work spread over ineffective exercises with ineffective equipment.

Curls, extensions, raises... they are ""isometric"" meaning they work 1 muscle. Dumbells can't hold that much weight, comapred to barbells. BARBELL Squats, deadlifts, presses and cleans are compound exercises, working many muscles at once. 

Growing your body with isometric exercises instead of compound exercises is like digging a shovel with a spoon instead of a shovel.

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","They don't look bloody or dirty, but I would suggest cleaning them out with some sort of antibiotic (I use [this](http://www.amazon.com/Neosporin-Wound-Cleansing-2-3-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B0036B7ZTY) because it doesn't sting). Then take a small gauze pad and place it over the injured part of the pad, so the wound is sort of stuck together and do a fairly loose wrap of a self adhering bandage like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Nexcare-Coban-Self-Adherent-Wrap/dp/B00112RP2C). You want to be careful to avoid cutting off circulation.

Also, if you don't have a cone you may have trouble keeping the bandages on. Unless they seem to be bothering him a lot, I wouldn't worry too much.


Good luck and take care.

*Randy* wanted too much money, so Dana let him starve for a year.  Now they are both better off, Randy making movies and taking easy 'sunset' fights.

I agree *TUF* is lacking talent, I don't see how that's Dana's fault.  It makes money, a lot of people benefit from that money (young fighters, trainers, the camera crew, the production team, occasionally the fans).  That show puts food in a lot of mouths and turns a profit, are you suggesting they cancel it and lay those people off?

His *twitter*?  Really?  What about all the Spike Tv specials leading to a fight?  The televised weigh ins?  The mini-bios and trash talk they play right before a fight?  I think the talent is promoted just fine in the UFC.  Jon Fitch wants me to follow him on twitter, or Joe Lauzon, they are welcome to say so into Rogan's mic.

And *Fedor*, screw him.  He wants too much money, and I've personally felt for years that he ducks top competition (Tim Sylvia, Arlovski, UFC has-beens).

You're likely thinking of the [caduceus](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Caduceus).  I understand that they're becoming somewhat less common as a medical symbol, and in many places they are being replaced with the similar [Rod of Asclepius](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Rod_of_Asclepius):

&gt;The caduceus is sometimes used as a symbol of medicine and/or medical practice, especially in North America, due to widespread confusion with the traditional medical symbol, the rod of Asclepius, which has only a single snake and no wings. This erroneous use of the caduceus became established in the United States in the late 19th century as a result of mistakes and misunderstandings which have been well-documented.[6]  Today, the initial errors which led to its adoption often go unremarked or unnoticed. However, numerous specialized professional and academic studies of its symbolic significance note the initial error and its perpetuation.[7]  Most attempts to defend its use in a medical context date from the last quarter of the 19th century through the first quarter of the 20th, and have been characterized as ""based on flimsy and pseudo-historical research"".[8]  When the mistaken use in the United States became better-known, a number of organizations changed from using the caduceus to using the rod of Asclepius, notably the American Medical Association.[9]  As Robert B. Taylor has observed, ""Today, there are calls to clarify the symbol and to move to a uniform use of the Aesculapian staff to symbolize medicine.""[10]","1283307976"

"programming","t5_2fwo","That's one reason yes.  Pretty much all benchmarks show that printf is about 2-3 times faster than cout with full optimizations.  Some STL implementations provide a syncwithcstdio flag which can improve the performance but benchmarks still show that with this flag it's still slower.  Just in general, if performance is the key concern then the C library is typically much faster than C++'s iostream.  Performance is only one factor of course.

The other reason is likely that looking at an example of something might not be the best indicator of how the library is implemented on the back-end, but rather meant to be an illustration of a simple use case.","1283308006"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I was trying to say that given the god you described is in fact omnipotent, then you have given that god can do the impossible and the argument stops there because if you grant that impossible things are possible then the rest of the argument is simply put, moot.  There is no point to then go on posing an argument to put omnipotence to the test.  You granted the ability of doing the impossible at the onset of the argument.  Therefore if your described god can do the impossible, then he can still do the impossible no matter what test you put forth to try to disprove the granted omnipotence.  

The idea is a good one but, if you grant perfect omnipotence then you run into the same problem as what you are trying to resolve by putting forth the question in the first place.  It is impossible to prove or disprove that an omnipotent being can both do the impossible and not do it at the same time.  This would fall under the impossible but since the god as you described is omnipotent he is therefore capable of doing the impossible.  Then you come full circle back to the beginning of not being able to prove that an omnipotent entity, is able to do the impossible.  If that entity is truly omnipotent then yes the impossible is possible,  You have proved nothing and at the same time not give disproof.

It is a fun thought to toy with but the question is fundamentally flawed from the outset.  If you ignore that then yes, it could give a few more minutes or hours of pondering.  I, however, find it hard to ignore something as glaringly obvious as ruining an argument before you you even get to posing it.  It kind of takes all of the fun out of it.  

So to sum up, there is nothing impossible to a being that can do the impossible.  Trying to prove otherwise would be impossible, so it seems to me to be a worthless endeavor.  

Sorry if I came off like an ass in the first post I re-read it and thought man I would tell myself to fuck off if I got that response.  Thanks for taking it easy on me.","1283308008"

At first it felt like I really had to work hard to prove that I could hack it, I was dreaming of earning my place on the team with sacks and touchdowns, but that was just me.  When it came down to it, I wasn't the worst player on the team, I didn't fumble or mess up the play, I could take a hit like anyone else and I was willing to practice and improve.  That's all that anyone else expected from me, that's all the boys expected of me.  The first time I got hit and bled and kept on with practice everyone else stopped caring that I was a girl.  It is the same everywhere, I've been in the military, now I'm in business, no one cares if you are a boy or a girl, they just want to to do your job and not fuck shit up any more than anyone else does.

WoW isn't easier. There is now easy content that precedes the difficult content. Get in a guild. Stay away from PUGs. Do heroic content. Enjoy the part of the game that is *designed to your tastes*, rather than wasting time on the content that's balanced for someone else entirely.

To your first point: The cross realm systems help you find random people to fill roles you would fill with strangers anyway. At high level arena play you get very familiar with the people at your rank, if that's the kind of intimacy you seek.

Second, the people. There are simply more players. Finding players of a like mind simply requires some patience now. Again, get in a guild that suits you. Find community in other similar size guilds on your server.

And third, I've already addressed this: There is easy content that precedes the challenging content. This creates an environment of various strata where many play styles are accommodated. Play the style of content that suits you.

You're re-entering the world at a very inopportune time; at the end of a content cycle. The current design is that old content that has been live for several years is quickly overcome, and new content is challenging.

Finally, the original AV was scrapped before BC even released. Only a demented kind of player could even stay in an AV from the time it began to the eventual end, up to *24 hours later*. Nobody achieved anything, or gained anything. It was an absurd system. AV is now like a PVE race, where two teams attempt to beat the opposing boss before the other, balancing resources between offence, and slowing down the enemy.","1283308114"

As to helmets, mostly they are crap.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in your boat only a few months ago.  I hated the idea that people, on average, spend around $20,000 on a one day affair, and I refused to do it.  

By being frugal, we were able to spend $4,000 and not want for much.  Everything was absolutely beautiful.  

The few main things I suggest:


First of all, comparison shop for *everything*.  Also, try to avoid the ""wedding"" section of stores.   Just having the word ""wedding"" on a package jacks the price up.  For example, instead of getting a traditional guest book (boring, white, and frilly), search Amazon for a journal that matches your theme (I'd suggest something from the Peter Pauper Press...very cute and affordable).  


Try to find as many of your own decorations/accessories as possible, instead of hiring someone.  Don't be afraid to look in dollar stores, Big Lots and in clearance sections.


Make your own favors.  Kits are way overpriced.  


Don't be ashamed to look on Macy's or JC Penney's website for a wedding dress.  They cost between $100 and a few thousand.  Mine ended up being $150ish, and it was very similar to my ""dream dress"" (what I always pictured myself wearing). 


Go with a small wedding party.  The groom and I each had 2 people standing up there with us.


Don't go with fresh flowers.  We bought $100 worth of silk flowers and I made my bouquet, my bridesmaid's bouquet (my ""maid-of-honor"" was actually my male best friend, so he didn't get one) and corsages and boutonnieres for the rest of the party, parents and grandparents.  My bouquet was gorgeous, and now I can keep it as a reminder of the day.  


Instead of a tiered cake, get a small 8 or 10 inch round, decorated cake for the head table, and serve guests sheet cake of the same flavor.


If you need any help or have any questions, please feel free to PM me.  I would even be willing to show you pics to prove that it wasn't a debacle.  ","1283308148"

From what I understand, it's an immune disorder, and I have seen many specialists about it that have explained this. I have no stress and my hair still doesn't grow. I'm just saying it like it is, hiding behind it also hides your self confidence, always worrying about what people will think when they find out or if your wig comes off accidentally. Of course being behind the wig makes you feel not naked, it's security for you. Shaving your head, not hiding and accepting who you are brings you out of your shell. Your situation with not being able to pick up women and not knowing anyone tells me you are in your shell. I know it's a hard decision, it was very frightening for me at the age of 20. But believe me, once you get over that initial big step, it gets easy very fast and you no longer feel naked. Trust me, I've been there man, I spent a whole decade just like you and I don't even think about it anymore. It was all in my head.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","He's talking about Einstein's General Relativity (GR), and the way it models space and time as a single thing that is distorted by the presence of mass or energy.

This model makes several predictions, all of which have been shown to be correct. time after time. For instance, GR says time slows down for reference frames (think, ""points of view"") close to massive objects, and this has been shown to be true. We've synchronized high-precision atomic clocks and sent one of them to orbit. The one in orbit ""ticked"" faster than the one that remained on Earth's surface, and the amount was exactly the amount predicted by GR. All communication satellites today rely on the accuracy of these predictions.

Other than that, a lot of large-scale phenomenon have been accurately predicted and explained by this theory, including weird behaviors of planet orbits (Mercury's orbit was one of the first experimental results in favor of GR), gravitational lensing, etc.

&gt;Also, why is space some kind of flat fabric that's affected by the weight of the marble-like planets and moons? How is it possible for space and time to make this invisible net that accounts for gravity?

We have no idea. The nature of gravity has been puzzling physicists for years now.

&gt;Isn't gravity viewed as a force?

In classical Newtonian mechanics, it is. However, General Relativity explains the measured force as merely a result of the deformation of spacetime. It's a little too complicated to explain. The analogy with the elastic bed works for a lot of things, but don't take it literally.

&gt;Spacetime seems to make me think of gravity more like the relative flatness or depression of the fabric instead of some quantifiable thing like a force.

Yeah, that's the idea, actually.

Humans are basically monogamous, but not completely.  Love is an emotional explanation for a biological reaction.  Love is also overwhelmingly defined by Hollywood - westerns wouldn't generally consider Indian arranged marriages as ""true love"" but they seem to work as well if not better than their western counterparts (at least until western society starts to leave its imprint on their cultural norms).

The retard has returned from his hibernation.  We thought he had grown tired of this tedious process as he hid in his box for several days.  But we are delighted that he is back.  Homophobia, although present seems to be subsiding gradually.

It is difficult to decipher the language and thoughts of the severely mentally crippled).

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I give sick BJs. Sometimes guys just jerk off too hard though, so they might take a bit longer. Tell him to stop jerking off dry and use lube, and to masturbate less. This will make it easier for you. Now for my special technique!

FIRST: BJ's are mostly about the performance. Look fucking hungry. 

Basically what you do is get the whole dick all wet, whether it be with some flavored lube or spit. The best spit is the thick deep throat spit that comes up after you've had a dick all the way down your throat. If you can't deep throat, just spitting on it isn't sexy. Discreetly spit in your palm or something while his eyes are closed or his head is rolled back. I like to use lube; guys usually aren't used to the sensation during a blow job at first, so it makes it extra special.

My power move is what I call ""The Corkscrew."" It's worked on 95% of guys I've given BJ's to, and the other 5% was too drunk to fuck anyway. Grab a wet dick with both hands (This works best with lube), right hand on top if you're a righty. Slide your hands up and down the shaft and head, applying pressure adequately, with your hands twisting back and forth at the same time, like you're giving him an indian burn or something, except for that it feels like heaven. Put your mouth on the head of the dick, suck and swirl your tongue around it, while moving your head up and down at the same time, in sync with your hand movements. 

If you get tired, do the same movements, except twist your top hand to stimulate the head, while you look at him all sexy and say something hot. 

If all else fails, and the sex ceases to be sexy, then just stop. Nothing is worse than feeling self conscious during sex, and he's probably feeling bad about lasting so long, you're wondering if you're giving a bad bj; Not sexy. Not all sex needs to end in an orgasm. Take a break and try again later. Good luck!","1283308208"

In my mid 30s now, I'm at a solid 185 lbs with around 7-8% body fat.  The advantage we hardgainers have is we stay lean.  Everything we put on has to be muscle, because we couldn't get fat if we tried.  Its a good thing, trust me!

For the advice, if you're already in the industry my advice would be, and this goes for any industry, be nice! Some people, when met with early success, can really treat others poorly. Some people are downright asses towards co-workers. The video game industry is a small one, and reputations can build quite quickly and stick around. In my early days I worked with a guy from Blizzard, (post StarCraft), that thought very highly of himself. So much so that he had to go to a small, unstable startup game company just to get a job. (except that because he was from blizzard, the studio paid him a shitload, but you get my point) 

That and just work your ass off. People notice that, even in a business where everyone works 60 hr weeks. Show initiative. Don't ask to do things, or wait around to be told what to do. 

Oh, and you will work a lot. The hours can be terrible. Marriage-breaking terrible. So keep it all in perspective, but be prepared to be asked to work a lot.

This allows for chaos and a criminal training ground where if someone who is somewhat innocent (a pot dealer) will be forced to assimilate to the criminal's world.  This semi-innocent person now must live as though he is a murderer.  Chaos and criminal University happens.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Even if it were legalized, wouldn't it still be illegal to partake publicly, just like alcohol? On your point of accidental false positives, marijuana tests have a lower threshold that you have to get above to actually test positive. If you have &lt; 50ng/1mL of THC in your blood, you wouldn't fail the drug test. Also, in an open air environment, your chances of accidently inhaling enough marijuana from random people passing by to impair motor function is miniscule at best.

That being said, thank you for taking the time to write out your concerns with marijuana legalization. While I do not share these specific concerns (obviously lol), I appreciate you writing out a coherent, sensible comment instead of, ""It's bad b/c it's illegal, it's illegal b/c it's bad."" 

You also bring up a great point about smoking around children. I would sincerely hope any parents with young children would not force them to endure their parents' vices, just as I hope people don't smoke cigarettes in the car with their kids in the backseat. It is actually illegal where I live to smoke a cigarette with someone under the age of 18 in the car.

I place the order, and things look like they are going to pan out.  I give you my money, you give me a laptop.  However,  the computer never arrives.  The next two months I spend hours on the phone trying to find out what is going on, and I heard every single excuse you could imagine, starting with assurance that I already had it, and ending with the fact that it was never made or shipped, and never will be for that matter.  I used to have the time line carefully documented with all the blatant lies and just downright incompetent hilarity which I was sure would leverage me some sort of compensation.  In the end, I finally was able to talk to someone who claimed they had the power to help me.  At least 10 hours of phone calls and emails later, they said I could have my money back and to keep me as a customer, I could have $50 off my next purchase.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4"," Well, you're not in outrageously bad shape or anything. If you're looking for simple health and not strength or anything, I would look into [HIIT](http://ericcressey.com/interval-training-hiit-or-miss). Shown to be better than steady-state cardio in most respects. Basically, running for an hour is less effective than 15 or 20min of sprint/rest cycles (including warm-up and cool-down). And long-duration cardio makes your muscles a lot smaller than HIIT. 

 A diet consisting of whole, unprocessed foods, with roughly equal parts fat, protein and carbs is good for someone athletic who is not lifting tons of heavy things. The whole low-fat thing has been shown to be a giant mistake. Sugar, white flour, and other refined, processed foods are the enemy, not fat. The lecture [Sugar: The Bitter Truth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM) has helped a lot of us understand the issue. It's a bit long, but a really, really good place to start. It cites many thorough scientific studies instead of merely appealing to authority.

Once an hour is a good metric to go by. Possibly less if you're female and inexperienced. If you think it's getting to you, switch to having water for every second drink.

&gt;Which drinks do you order a shot glass of, and which do you order a mug for?

Just ask for the drink. The bartender will take care of what it's served in. No-one's going to give you a pint glass of vodka.

If you're planning to drink a lot over a period of several hours, it pays to not mix your poisons. Pick one drink and stick with it for the night. This (may) reduce your chance of a bad hangover. You don't have to sample everything behind the bar on your first visit.

People complain about Monsanto suing for keeping seeds for next year, but it is in the contract that they make their consumers sign that they cannot reuse a crop as seed.  Farmers still benefit from using Monsanto seed, because they produce much more per acre and make more money, even though part of that is paid to Monsanto.  Monsanto is a product of free market capitalism, if you use their seed you will produce more and make more money.

When Buddhism arrived, Christians in Tibet and parts of China tried to dialogue ecumenically with the new faith. Unfortunately they lost sight of their own tradition in the process; their attempts to interpret the sutras from a Christian point of view failed to Christianize Buddhism, though the Christians did contribute a few elements unique to the Tibetan tradition.

The Buddhist/Hindu mindset has the ability to assimilate nearly any faith either as one of its many strands of devotion and faces of godhead, or (as with the Parsees, Jains, Sikhs and Mar Thoma Christians) as a respected, nonthreatening ethnic faith. ","1283308362"

Keep in mind the cartridges between the blu and the prosmoke aren't interchangeable.
