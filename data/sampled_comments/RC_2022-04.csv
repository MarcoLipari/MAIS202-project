"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","My genuine belief is that my siblings weren't neglected. I appreciate that I'm on the outside looking in, so I could be wrong, but none of my siblings have said they felt neglected and my parents were involved parents for them, it was just me that got different treatment, and my siblings have acknowledged that they had involved parents while I didn't. They even used to joke about me being a friend of the family as my parents treated me differently to them. My parents were willing to look after them when they were young, and be involved as they aged, and they got therapy and financial help when they started their adult lives, so they got what I got with the addition of our parents being involved before that. There may have been some parentification in the way they consoled me growing up, but even that mostly began when they were adults and I was a teenager, and it was mostly text based. If it was that they received the same treatment I did, I would understand them much better, but I truly don't believe they did.

There is a chance that I'm wrong, or that this is still an issue, so I will try and bring this up with them and suggest family therapy, but we'll have to see how well it goes from there.",1648771200

Use a 0 point pistol and a weapon of your choice for large - I used the variable rifle. 

For skills, take crafter 3, lucky break 3, and marathon runner 1. 

In games, you'll focus on finding crates (white dots on the mini map, looks like a tool box), making anything you can (medkits, smoke bombs, and shivs are best).

 Once you make 2 crafted items, you'll earn a gift, give it to your teammates. 

Rinse and repeat - you need to get zero kills and you'll rack up supplies like a king. 

Follow the pattern of 1 game, get supplies, then skip the next two games. You do this over and over, only deviating when you have a 100% population risk mission. 

Never pick the same objective twice (unless you know you can handle it, the count goes up) on those 100% missions. 

Pretty soon in less than 100 games played to finish you'll have your firefly and hunter journeys complete. 

Note: playing craft-gift boy is a great way to get to 40 population fast. Start your skip pattern after you get it.",1648771200

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I think eventually, I will. I have dual citizenship (US and UK), which makes things a tad complicated, and in a few years I'm planning on probably renouncing my UK citizenship (essentially going to the British government and un-citizening myself) because the UK is kind of shit for trans people and also I can't say that I'm particularly inclined to stay in contact with some of my relatives that live there.

Anyway, when I get my license and legal name stuff sorted out, probably. I kind of despise travelling internationally, if I'm being honest, so there will be few times I do need it or even if I need it for other identification purposes. I'm hoping that the world will start to edge towards being more trans-safe within the next few years. I'm also white, which definitely provides me with privilege. Even if it means that I'll go through some shitty stuff, travelling is kind of a situation you thrust yourself into intentionally so I think I'd be somewhat prepared, and I think that there'll be a level of necessity for some of us to go through unpleasant or dangerous situations so it becomes safer and more normalized for the rest, bleak as that may sound.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Some context, when I was in my late teens I was in and out of the doctor's a lot for abnormal bone growth. So all of my friends knew I had something wrong with me, just not exactly what. I was pretty scrawny looking, so I didn't exactly radiate the image of ideal health either.

I'm 16m, in highschool, it's April 1st and I have an anxiety attack during class. Teacher doesn't believe me, because it's April 1st, my anxiety only gets worse. Now I actually can't breathe, my chest hurts and I'm desperately trying to not cry in front of a full classroom. The teacher makes me explain what's wrong, I barely get out ""My chest hurts"" and my best friend stands up and starts explaining that I'm actually sick, and at some point I black out.

I wake up three hours later in the hospital. Parents are there, they explain the anxiety attack, no big deal. I walk out into the little lobby area and all of my friends are there, all of them are ugly crying. They see me and mass hug me, I can barely understand them. I'm confused, my parents are confused.

 Finally one of my friends manages to stop long enough, ""I'm so sorry to hear you have CANCER""

""I...I don't have cancer?!""

My best friend: AHAHAHA APRIL FOOLS GUYS

TLDR; While I was in the hospital, my best friend told everyone we knew I had bone cancer as a fucking April Fool's joke",1648771201

It's the nationalism that pervades everything in the US that has convinced you all that it was justified, while the rest of the world looks on in horror and disgust.

&gt;where slaughtering innocent Chinese woman and children, of course only after raping them and torturing them first

Yes, and that was pure, unadulterated evil. But the 70,000 schoolchildren who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, many through painful, torturous burns and poisoning, were not a party to that. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilian targets.

Never forget how many Japanese women American soldiers raped during the invasion of Okinawa and the occupation of Japan. American soldiers are still raping Japanese women every year while stationed on the bases in Okinawa. 

&gt;Japan during ww2 is arguable one of the top 5 worst countries in the world as far as humanitarian things go

And America during Iraq and Vietnam join them. America joined them when they dropped the bombs.

&gt;the bombs where a way to show Japan we will not take anything less than complete surrender

The bombs were a way to show the USSR what you have.

&gt;You don't have to be a nationalist, you don't even have to be an American to be able to look at Japan in ww2 and know with out question they needed stopped by any means necessary

They had been stopped. Their military was decimated. They had no more civilians to gas, torture, kill and rape. Only invading soldiers to defend against. There would have been more bloodshed, but there would have been less civilian bloodshed.

What was your vet's prognosis? If not given, please feel comfortable calling back to ask this important question! We can typically stall kidney failure at it's current state - which might be tolerable if there are no symptoms at home regardless of the labwork results.

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","I don't believe so. Remembering the early 2010s SJW wars, I heard a lot of people throwing around this definition that ""Power + Prejudice = Racism"", meaning without power there can be no racism. Which makes no fucking sense. Obviously people can devise systems that are deliberately racist against minorities, but that doesn't exclude individual racism from minorities towards a majority. Sure we bombed the shit out of the middle east, but 9/11 wasn't okay, it's not excluded because ""reverse racism isn't real"". Less than a minute of thinking and you can debunk that shit, not to mention that's not the definition of racism.

Agenda pilled side note: The U.S. has definitely oppressed minorities constantly. From slavery, to the natives, to the actual internment camps we had for Japanese people during WW2 (but not Germans of course, they're white). 13th amendment loophole, war on drugs, the sterilization of women in prisons, ICE detention camps, and even simply in poor neighborhoods (look up ""Mississippi Appendectomy""). Just because you haven't seen it for yourself doesn't mean it doesn't happen my friend. Remember that the U.S. is 50 radically different states and ideals masquerading as one. California does dumb libtard shit, Texas does dumb conservatard shit, and it'll likely always be this way. The thing that makes America special is we're stupid in every possible way",1648771205

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","&gt;But microwaves do use radiation and aren‚Äôt really healthy. 

In the context of the entire thread, this isn't really that relevant but do you really believe this?

Saying microwaves use radiation is like saying a light globe or even your standard electric oven. Yes, it emits EM radiation, but it is not ionising EM.

The point about microwaves not being healthier is also arguable. Most research shows it is basically no different to other heating methods (yes, for some compounds it may reduce certain things like flavonoids more than boiling (3% loss vs 2% loss) but for other things like phenolics, microwaves caused less of a drop than boiling. It also depends on the food, some types are more impacted than others using different heating methods. The argument that I would concede is, microwaves may cause leaching of plastic compounds into foods, but this is more a case of people putting using containers that shouldn't go into a microwave for this exact reason. It would be like saying frying is on a pan is more unhealthy because some people use motor oil instead of vegetable/olive/whatever.",1648771206

The officer that shows up at your house is most likely on your neighborhood beat and may even recognize the guy. He will know to be on the lookout for that particular guy especially with any future thefts.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Halle Berry's character wasn't out of the game she just moved up. John *was* out of the game at the beginning of JW2. He said he was back in JW1 but I think that wasn't him being serious and more just an attempt at intimidating the people who had him tied up.  

John didn't just kill Santino because he made him fulfill his end of the contract, he killed him because his house was blown up and Santino put a gigantic bounty on his head. John understood the rules of The Continental but figured he had no choice when it came to his current situation because he would still be hunted due to the bounty. He killed Santino less because he wanted to and more because it was the only choice he thought he had. 

I doubt John ever wanted to kill Winston for the Elder, he just wanted to get his life back. So when he got back to the states he chose to stand by Winston, the person who on multiple occasions has helped him over the last two movies despite John breaking the rules of The Continental, instead of the Elder. 

I don't think Winston shot John out of nowhere. I think they are both playing the High Table. There is no way he would have survived a surprise gunshot and a fall off the roof of a tall building unless it was staged.  I assume that will be addressed in the fourth film. 

It makes sense that John would want to kill The Elder after him and The High Table just tried to kill him after John showed his loyalty by cutting off his ring finger/his life away from the game.",1648771207

"trans","t5_2shbb","It feels very telling that one of the biggest issues in making English more gender-neutral is the alternative to sir/ma'am, like, we have all kinds of pronouns and a million ways to address people it feels like, but even ""Mx."" is hard to adopt and tbh I think there's a better alternative (Mistrum, abbreviated to Mt. or Mm.) but it's unlikely to catch on as much because 1, people seem to like the ""x = more gender-neutral"" thing for some reason, 2, it's easier to pronounce so of course those who stand against us would be more opposed to it and would use the excuse ""well Mx. came first so"" or whatever to try to force us into the less useful one.

"CelebDPP","t5_3ggzk","#Hey, /u/clitoriskybusiness, your post is missing an important statement about your age and what you're looking for in an RP. Just repost with the required disclaimer and it'll be approved instantly. 

You **MUST** include **""I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+""** in your post. Please correct this and repost.

**This is a copy of the original post:**

You've recently struck gold. Having come into so much money, you've decided to move from your shitty apartment to a beautiful, modern mansion in the Hollywood Hills. 

And, just your luck, you happen to be living right next to your favorite celebrity. 

You don't even realize it at first. Then, one day, as you're working in your home office on the top floor of your mansion, you happen to catch a glimpse of me. You can glimpse a small corner of my backyard, where I'm lounging by my pool. 

I don't realize you can see me. The mansion is new and much taller than the last house that was there, so my fences can't quite block your view. I'm used to relaxing, naked, poolside, getting sun on every inch of my body - including one area where there's quite a few inches. 

That's right. Your favorite celebrity has a huge, meaty cock between her legs. 

----

Howdy folks! I hope you like this one. My favorite celebrities are Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Biel, Katie McGrath, Angie Varona, Hayley Atwell, Ariel Winter, Billie Eilish, Gemma Chan, Alexandra Daddario, Kaya Scodelario and Gemma Arterton but I'd also love to hear who you like. 

In your first message to me, please flesh out your character's backstory (if you want to), your likes/dislikes, and tell me what your favorite movie is (or movies, if you can't decide). 

I hope to hear from you all!

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","This is going to sound a bit silly, but I got out of Bronze to Silver by switching computers. My roommate watched me play on my laptop and said ""is that an airplane taking off?"" Obviously, I didn't have a dedicated gaming laptop and it was overheating badly. I bought a new desktop computer and it's been a big improvement. I got into Silver almost immediately. 

The climb from Silver to Gold was a lot slower, but I found a few things helpful, mostly the usual advice you see on Reddit:

\- I mained one role (support). I did this during a time when support was the least wanted role and it was mostly auto-filled and people did it badly, so I figured if \*I\* played support, we'd have a much better chance of winning. This all precedes ""support diff"" memes, but basically that. A support main &gt; a fill suport.

\- I limited my pool of ranked champions. Each successive season, the number of champions I tend to play decreases 24, 25, 12, 9, 8, 3, 2. I'm not as good on Thresh as I though, Janna was a coin flip, Taric got reworked and I couldn't play the new version as well, and Braum wasn't working out.

\- I still watch those reports on the meta to see what champions are good in each lane, but I don't take that as a message to switch to what's suddenly hot this patch. Alistar might suddenly be great and pros are doing well with him, but numbers-wise, I just do better on Nautilus. But, it's helpful to see trends, like enchanters are doing really well right now in low elo. 

\- Watching my own VODs helps, but I don't do it excessively. In the moment, it's easy to forget mistakes and I can recall moments after dying why it was dumb, but it's harder to remember at the end of the game why I died each time in the game. Reviewing it helps to see that I jumped into a bad fight, tried to ward too deeply, tower dove when my teammates were not with met, etc.  Then, the hard part is to be mindful in the next few games to do that less. I like the school of thought that while you're dead, you apply 0 cc, deal 0 damage, assist with 0 objectives. A lot of low elo players really just need to focus on dying less.",1648771209

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","If you think that her paying your rent might be an avenue for her to abuse you worse, then don't take it.  If you think that ultimately your taking the money for rent will make things better, then definitely take it.  

I think it would probably be food for you to get away from her, however, I am also concerned she may force you to live with her again if she has a tantrum later or try to control you with threats of making you move home.  Does that make sense?  But, if you don't have other options and this is a chance at a fast forward toward freedom, maybe it's worth it.  Only you would know if it might be worth the risk.  

No matter what good she may do you now, it doesn't change what she did before.  My mother could be very generous and surprisingly so with gifts.  At the same time, I have serious PTSD from her abuse of her, her not protecting me from my NPD father, and she sexually abused me.  I hold these two realities separately.  She abused me horribly.  She could be fun and generous.  Both of these things are true and that she one time took me to the mall and got me all the clothes I needed for a new job that one time doesn't cure my trauma.  I have valid reasons to be angry at her.  

I don't mean to derail your post and make this about me, but I mean to illustrate how you can understand that a parent is abusive, understand that your trauma is real, and also understand that they gave you some nice gift that one time.

I would start by making a single-player prototype of your top-down shooter. Given that you're already a programmer, I wouldn't bother trying to start with the basics like Pong or whatever. There are a number of front-end libraries and frameworks that will make this a lot easier. I'm fond of Phaser and Pixi.js.

Do note that setting up a front-end project can be a bit of a pain. It's common to want to write in TypeScript, and bundle with something like WebPack, ESBuild, or Rollup.js, and by the time you set that up you'll be thoroughly annoyed with front-end programming.",1648771212

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","Some people do!  Probably not people you like, though?

I don't have a specific episode, but Russ Roberts of EconTalk has often said things about more babies/people being a good thing because so far, every awesome invention or thing that made life better came from human ingenuity, and more humans = more ingenuity!  Lyman Stone also makes pro-natalist arguments a lot.

Traditional Catholics/ Tradwife and other traditionalists/ fundamental religionists (18 kids and counting! Fundamentalist Mormons!) also often feel this way.  Women with no or few children are pitied and women with many are held up as great examples.  Preventing the birth of a child is seen as a moral wrong.

Also, white supremacists!  So yeah. . .

But, ""moral hero"" might not be quite right.  I would say they are viewed as blessed and also having complied with their moral obligation.   Partly, I suspect because in the traditional views, women are responsible for the bearing and raising of children and it is framed as a duty rather than a heroic choice.  I suspect this is the result of patriarchy/sexism in that the frame is ""women should/must do this"" and ""women who don't are selfish"" (your ""moral duty"" framing) rather than ""women may do this"" and ""women who do are heroically self-sacrificing.""

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","Okay, I have a couple of questions.

To drive on a provisional licence, you need a supervisor in the car with you, who is 21 years old, fully licensed to drive the vehicle you‚Äôre driving, and has held that licence for three years. There is actually *no requirement* for that supervisor to be insured. You also need to display L-plates.

If you were displaying L-plates, and your aunt is over 21, held a full driving licence, and has held that licence for three years, then I‚Äôm not convinced the offence was committed - even though she wasn‚Äôt insured to drive the car.

Similarly - if you‚Äôre named on the insurance policy, it‚Äôs very likely that they would cover you in the event of an accident, to the minimum standard required by law. You should contact your insurers, have a *full and frank* conversation with them about the circumstances, and ask them if they would have covered you if you had an accident. If the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù then you would not have been driving without insurance. Get a written confirmation from them.

As for driving without due care - looks like you did that and you‚Äôre probably going to have to eat that one.

&gt; How can I persuade the magistrates to not impose a disqualification?

Errrr‚Ä¶ they probably won‚Äôt? Points don‚Äôt ‚Äústack‚Äù if you‚Äôre convicted of two or more offences arising out of the same incident. The magistrates work out which offence is the most serious, and then give you points for *that offence only*. In this case, the most serious offence will either be driving without insurance (which carries 6 to 8 points), or careless driving (which carries 3 to 11). 

The magistrates will decide - if you had been convicted only of driving without insurance, how many points would they give you? And if you had been convicted only of driving carelessly, how many points would they give you? Whichever is higher, you get the points for. The others are endorsed on your record but receive no points. You can‚Äôt receive twelve points for this incident.

Strictly speaking, the magistrates can disqualify for any offence without awarding points, but in my view this is unlikely.",1648771213

Amini isn't really to blame for The Snowman being shit, considering 15 - 20% of the script wasn't even shot. Beattie has a bit of a mixed track record, he's been nominated for best screenplay awards for three of his films, and along with one worst screenplay award for GI Joe. He's not really as bad as some have made him out to be.

Friedman is someone who I'm completely unfamiliar with, though considering she wrote for this and Willow it does inspire confidence that Lucasfilm is letting her work on two projects.

"factorio","t5_2wabp","At least they're getting stuck at the depot. Worst case is they have 0.9 units of fuel and they manage to unload it into a system with different fluids. Might want to double check for that.



How I set things up:

* Limit trains to the to number of tanks per wagon you have at the station. You should never need more than that many trains on the way to the station.

* Set request threshold to the maximum amount of fluid the train can hold. For example 4 fluid wagons would be 100k

* Set the negative amount of the fluid in question to a maximum of ~75% of the total capacity of the station tanks. This can be lower, usually two trains worth of fluid is plenty even with higher throughput. This number needs to be atleast as large as the request threshold(but negative) so make sure to have enough storage tanks.

* wire up the storage tanks to the constant combinator with the above values and then to the LTN lamp


The more throughput you want from a station with multiple wagons per train ,the more complicated the blanacing setup needs to be. Fortunately this problem isn't LTN specific and [Nilaus has a guide on how to balance them](https://youtu.be/zJBvw28bQu0)",1648771214

Haven't smelled anything like it since. 

If I do, oh my, I'd probably nostalgia trip so hard. My mom had old makeup from the 60s, and I happened to smell something akin to that old lipstick she had just a few days ago, and I'm pretty sure my brain starting producing all the happy chemicals it hasn't made in 20 years.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","&gt;The parent company that controls Now Magazine has voluntarily filed for bankruptcy, stating it has $2.25-million in liabilities and just $352 in total assets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Toronto-based publishing company Media Central Corp. Inc., which is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and in Germany, said its debt includes a $1-million convertible debenture held by a group of investors. Earlier this month, the company said it was trying to reach an agreement with the debtholders after it defaulted on the loan.  
&gt;  
&gt;The bankruptcy filing will not affect the company‚Äôs two flagship publications, Now Magazine, published in Toronto by subsidiary Now Central Communications Inc., and Georgia Straight, published by Vancouver Free Press Publishing Corp., according to the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;While Media Central said Now Magazine will continue publication as usual, the news and entertainment magazine‚Äôs acting editor, Radheyan Simonpillai, posted on Twitter at the beginning of March that Now was scaling back its print publications as a cost-saving measure as it transitions its audience online.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2019, the company launched digital cannabis publication CannCentral, and the following year opened eCentralSports, an e-gaming media outlet. Media Central did not say whether the two websites would continue operating.  
&gt;  
&gt;Media Central‚Äôs voluntary bankruptcy follows a series of leadership and other changes at the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;On March 9, Media Central announced chief financial officer Carmelo Marrelli had resigned effective Jan. 25, after less than a year in the role. In the same release it said its 2020 auditors, Fazzari + Partners, had resigned.  
&gt;  
&gt;In mid-March, the company said in a statement that it was still defending itself against a civil claim for $250,000 dating back to July, 2020, brought by a former employee.  
&gt;  
&gt;Following the bankruptcy filing, Kirk MacDonald, formerly president of Media Central, will remain in his role as president of the company‚Äôs subsidiaries. Manos Pavlakis, David Daniels, and Carolyn Wall have resigned from their positions on the company‚Äôs board of directors, according to a news release.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company did not respond to requests for comment from The Globe and Mail.",1648771215

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","Why? Because , if it's a swap bundle such as a CDS, then underlying must stay within agreements to avoid larger losses. So, any movement of one, usually requires movement of another. But, here's the kicker with swap bundles. One of them could be a risk of reducing loss while the other is for liquidity or collateral. Once the value of the risk isn't offset anymore based upon interest payments, then it blows the shit out of the water with even needing to move the other(s). So, you're making a gamble on do you believe that ""the others"" will follow or they will only follow to a certain overall value of loss in that debt bundle. Then any positions of the underlying which were used for the debt swap are merely liquidated to pay for the default itself.

We've not reached that point yet and I'm excited to know if GME ever starts exceeding unmanageable prices that the others eventually drop off. That's when you'll know if they were truly bundled for total losses across all of them or they weren't and prices diverge.

""Derivatives can be used to ‚Äúhedge‚Äù or mitigate the risk of economic loss arising from changes in the value of the underlying item. Investors can also use them to ‚Äúspeculate‚Äù or increase their profit should the value of the underlying item move in the direction they anticipate.  
A CDS is a privately negotiated derivative through which a ‚Äúbuyer‚Äù pays an agreed-upon amount to a ‚Äúseller‚Äù and, in return, receives a payment if a certain event occurs (e.g., the underlying financial instrument defaults). The buyer does not need to own the underlying security and does not have to suffer a loss from the event in order to receive payment from the seller. Thus, CDS can be used for speculating (‚Äúnaked CDS‚Äù) or hedging (‚Äúnon-naked CDS‚Äù). And buyers and sellers can swap their contracts with others, though there is no oversight or transparency mechanism for the swaps.""

It has high sides so they do need to learn to jump up into them.

I do have pets: I've had several cats, one of which was my best childhood friend, and I currently live with 3 adorable rats. But as I said: feeling empathy toward an animal doesn't give him moral value.

We didn't *claim* that we are superior, but in approximately 7500 years, no ""pigs assembly"" as ever tried to ""overthrow the meat industry and ask for rights"" (maybe not as straightforwardly) or express this desire, not by instinctive fear .... ? I think ? Wait .... It's not impossible ... and if so: it would mean pigs (or any animal capable of that) fit in my definition of morality...

Hmm...

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","So it's a bit of a different perspective (and sure it may not be right) - I'm trying to think in the shoes of rich billionaires that have gotten their way for a hundred years thru cheating, politicking and disenfranchising the common man and woman. A financial terrorist if you will. 

From that perspective if I shorted 300 million shares of GME, I'm never planning to cover 300. Go ahead and take me to court. Why should I pay for counterfeit shares when it's the systems fault for letting it happen? This is the govts problem and maybe I get a small fine. 

If the sec ever stepped in and looked at this mess, they'd probably say there's too much to figure out. Just erase the books, account for 75 million shares and then find some low number or cost basis to return to investors for the rest, if even that. 

But once that 75 becomes say even 250 million official GameStop shares, it tightens the noose all that much more.  

If that makes sense? Going way way back I've said options will be the first place they mess with - theyre derivative contracts for the option to buy. If at any point they decide to like the cboe did, they'll just stop the play. But that's different than stopping the trade of actual shares for example. So I'm thinking in the same line of thought here.

"lostgeneration","t5_2r40j","those in power and their masters already know the answer to that last question. the real questions are: what is the rest of humanity gonna do about it? and would it even secure a hopeful future if the meek and humble ever acted in unison to stop this madness? what would the truth matter then when the ground will open up and swallow up everyone anway, moral standings be damned? to that i say: the only powers humans have are their bodies, their physical, mental, and emotional resources, and those of their families and friends. people have to work together with what they're dealt to overpower the structures they live under that make a human being feel powerless: fear, despair, and apathy. 

faith in one another is the answer. hope in one another is the answer. love for one another is the answer. life is only depressing when one surrenders or resigns to keep fearing one another, to keep holding despair in that the future will be worse, and to keep hating one another as the powers that be have ordered so. there is still purpose and meaning to be found, but those in power will do their best to bury that truth and will beat the rest senseless to deny everyone, including themselves, that right to find purpose and meaning just to preserve their ""places"", for whatever that means. they are miserable people with huge holes in their hearts. they have nearly everything material they could want, but still they yearn for more. stuff and status cannot fill a soul! 

with that in mind, know that justice is still within reach! but also know that this generation will most likely not be alive to see it. humanity still hasn't yet lost everything to power and standing. now, people are SO CLOSE to finding what's been bothering us. people with nothing to lose can play spoiler to spite power and status, but a people with almost nothing to lose will fight for everything. people have just one life. will they live for a cause or will they merely get by without? well, what will YOU do?",1648771217

"centrist","t5_2qx8j","International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states.  So‚Ä¶ does NYC have a permanent population?  Yes.  Do they have a defined territory?  Yes.  Do they have one government?  Yes.  Do they have the ability to enter into relations with Buffalo?  Yes.  They are‚Ä¶ by definition a state.  They are governed by one government.  They entered into a relation with all the other ‚Äústates‚Äù to form New York.  Just as Virginia, New York, Mass, etc entered into an agreement to form the United States.  
Oh, I know I know, they came AFTER the state of New York, cause that matters, its not like there has never been a state that existed AFTER the larger government controlled the area.  I mean, the US definitely didn‚Äôt have control of Nebraska long before Nebraska was a state‚Ä¶ oh shit.  That‚Äôs wrong.

"selfpublish","t5_2sew3","KDP may not be the best option. I'd agree a local digital printer will probably be better.

Here's why:

 \- If you set up on A4 and get them to print you don't need to worry about any issues that a KDP bot will flag but a human will ignore (eg an image that's 275 dpi instead of 300, or a margin that's 0.1 mm out)

 \- You can easily get extra copies usually within 24 hours from a local printer, whereas author copies (wholesale rate) take about 3 weeks to arrive

 \- Black and white printing through a local printer will probably be the same price, especially if you build a relationship with them.

If you do want to do the POD option, Ingram will be a better fit as they can set up a book to only be available from your account and not distributed anywhere",1648771217

"questionsfordudes","t5_3cjjv4","I used the approach most attorneys use in litigation - consider multiple reasonable possible answers to your own question before you even ask it, such that if the person answering the question does not tread carefully, they state the obviously incorrect because they either assume facts without evidence or with weak evidence, or they end up in an obvious cognitive distortion such that their logic then becomes unreasonable, which then yeilds to the heard mentality of mentally rehearsed stock answers. Even people with Ph.D.s suffer from the same problem: Consider that if you want to truly learn child psychology- Have a child teach you their psychology. Learned this the hard way with my Pastor's son and the stock i ended up funding in Hershey's chocolate. (The kid saved the chocolate, sold it by the bag, and bought stock).  Needless to say, the child did the right thing and returned what became the stock, which made a bit of money, along with teaching an important and rather painless life lesson that I should have learned 20 years ago.",1648771217

Electronics should be staffed with a Tech Consultant for all store open hours. myTime will allocate enough hours for open to close coverage for at least one team member in Electronics.

‚Ä¢ Tech Consultants should not be pulled to assist or work in other areas of the store while they are covering Electronics.

 ‚Ä¢ Store Directors and HR leaders own pre and post schedule analysis to validate teams are scheduled within payroll plan hours and ensure current scheduling meets guest and business needs.

‚Ä¢ Reference upcoming promotions and product launches to schedule increased coverage accordingly for increases in sales and guest traffic.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Reddit specifically doesn‚Äôt like to hear it, but honestly, the same thing is happening with police.  Fatal shootings by police officers hover around 1,000 a year despite there being hundreds of millions of police interactions per year.  The vast majority of those 1,000 are legitimate self defense shootings of very bad people. Reddit‚Äôs hive mind doesn‚Äôt like to hear it, but police officers are not the boogeyman.  But sure enough, if you really want to hate cops, you can find the evidence you need to confirm your own views though just like the 90‚Äôs kidnapping rage.


And similarly, there are negative effects from it all.  The strained relations between police and the communities they serve not only can make those interactions more dangerous, but it also doesn‚Äôt help our already rising crime statistics the past few years.  It also serves as a feedback loop because less and less quality candidates will want to join a profession they feel s not well supported.",1648771217

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","That's part of it, though we (non-Chinatown people) push a culture that continues to permit it by saying 'Well it's always been rough there'. We have mental health issues there of course (that most people won't dare utter institutionalization for). There are the addicts stealing anything they can get their hands on. Victims are handed replies that often start with ""I'm sorry that happened to you but until"" ~*revolutionary social paradigm shift*~ happens then it is what it is.

We even permit what's going on at a level that borders absurdity. Even here on Reddit I've seen people supporting taggers who are going over commissioned murals instead of siding with the Chinese shopkeepers. The vandals damn near have a [marketing dept](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vts/) and fan sites. Are we really going to tell these store owners its about mental health issues with a straight face? I've even seen people suggest the 'China COVID-19 goof' Grafitti on the lion out front of Sun Yat-Sen wasn't actually racist. (""None of that is a slur and the virus did come from China"").

"brandonsanderson","t5_2s2s6","Non-Brandon, definitely The Twelve Kingdoms vol. 1. The novel‚Äôs editor at TOKYOPOP was out sick, and the Japanese publisher complained about the TOKYOPOP advance reader copy (ARC). The editor had taken some liberties with the editing, including changing the chapter section numbering. I spent the next‚Ä¶week maybe? And put it back into shape. Essentially I did a second edit to make it closer to the translation. I found whole paragraphs that the editor had just deleted. And I managed to massage the InDesign file so the book still took up the same number of pages, meaning the printing cost would not change. Plus, when the book came out, it had only two typos in it. I was very happy with that. 

Also, I was the rewriter on volumes 3 and 4 of .hack//Another Birth. In this case I did not follow the original novel exactly in one particular scene, because the author clearly had no idea how scoring worked in a tennis match. The entire match was essentially one long volley exchange. So I made the scoring actually make sense. 

In Brandon‚Äôs books, I‚Äôm probably still most proud of finding a continuity error in Steelheart at the last minute. Two characters were talking with David, and one said he was going to place some explosives. At the end of their conversation, the announcement was made that the battle was starting. So the explosives never actually got placed, yet the battle was written as if they had been. I took this to Brandon and he was too busy writing another book to fix it. So I came up with a fix that involved splitting the conversation with the two people into two separate conversations with a scene between them, so enough time passed. I wrote up the changes and gave them to Brandon, and he approved it with only a couple small tweaks. So, about a page of Steelheart is actually my writing. I also did extensive research with the blueprints of a certain NFL stadium in order to get the placement of an escape route through a bathroom exactly right. 

I love working on all of Brandon‚Äôs books and it‚Äôs crazy I have this dream job. Though, his short story ‚ÄúDreamer‚Äù is one I just do not care for. The characters are completely unsympathetic.",1648771218

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Alright, I understand where you are coming from. The duration of time is greatly reduced to being only this life therefore if I am wrong I lost everything. Please correct me if I am wrong! 

If this life is everything then we are working from a nihilistic perspective because there is no point to this life as there is nothing we are working towards. If my life has no intrinsic value then I must assign meaning and purpose to my life - which is the basic premise of existentialism (see Nietschze). Therefore, the value I give my life is completely up to me - so if I value Christian beliefs and I am living towards that then I am living up to the value I assigned to my life. Consequently, when I die I haven‚Äôt actually wasted my life. 

I do not think it‚Äôs worth arguing whether life vs eternity is better because the logic doesn‚Äôt carry through to whether I wasted my temporal life. I do believe that weighting of life is relative to duration, which is the point that you are arguing against. 

If I may add, introducing the concept of us both being wrong and Islam being true would be futile to our argument because it assumed that both of our takes on life is chance. I am not sure about you but my faith in Christ is a measured and well-thought out decision that is based on the masses of evidence for the case of Christ.",1648771218

&gt;we again chose to remain prudent about the specific reason why until now to limit the risk to all of our affected users across affected models.

Why not communicate to your customers that there was a security risk; years ago? You didn't have to be specific about the vulnerability.  These customers were the ones that supported your company from day one (5+ years ago).

This is how you treat your early adapters? Didn't expect much more to be honest. These products are just re-purposed products and therefore this is a common problem in the tech industry.

Hopefully there's an investigation and the company folds. Drastic failures call for drastic measures.

I was an early supporter with v1, before anyone ever heard of your company. I recommended these cams to over 20 families over the years who all purchased these products.

Your customers are mad because you hid security issues. No one expects a company to release the exact nature of these vulnerabilities. But you hid this from customers and they are mad, upset and feel betrayed. Don't blame them if this gets worse.",1648771218

I will also rock side to side shifting my weight from one foot to the next in a bit of a metronome. I don't mind if people see me doing it - they can just assume I'm a fridgety person and it isn't their business anyway.

"animecirclejerk","t5_2thzw","Again due to the incredible negative perception of autism, its literally seen as synonym with Down syndrome where i live, i either have a choice of ""of course you dont have that"" or having the opportunity of explaining if the person is receptive to it. 

It may also have a personal effect, you might react much more negatively to an autism diagnosis than to an Asperger one due to these same factors

&gt; But the reverse is a problem because it sanitizes the legacy of a nazi official who actively made life worse for millions of disabled people who lived in nazi germany or the places it invaded.

I cant argue with this, however i belive that considering how little known he is(meaning it would take even more effort and goodwill from the other person to listen to you as well as lessening the modern support for eugenics its name generates) as well as how beneficial the term can be for many it shouldnt be retired just yet.
&gt; 
&gt;  If knowledge of autism is low, don‚Äôt weasel around it by calling it something else for other people‚Äôs sensitivities. Educate with the full history and most inclusive terms.


Again, its not for others but to protect yourself, and we still have to work against and with these old understandings and propaganda. If weaseling around is meant for me then no i will never use Aspergers without explaining the full context and problems with the term, but what i do is completely worthless to the discussion.",1648771219

"pregnant","t5_2qwzb","Waves of exhaustion come back like first trimester. 

Exhausted after finishing one household task. 

Lower back pain

Pain in pelvis

Breathing problems 

Baby movements seem a bit different. Not decreased, they are just running out of room. I noticed this around about 33 weeks. He has stronger kicks, but doesn‚Äôt seem to move all over my stomach as much. 

Hemorrhoids 

Random ravaging hunger and it being a bit harder to eat bigger meals. For example I could eat a corn dog and feel like I ate two plates of spaghetti. 

I‚Äôve had a lot of ankle pain.

Apathy. If I don‚Äôt really have to get up I just don‚Äôt. If something falls on the floor then ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 

I started getting bad insomnia, but I also started taking unisom so I‚Äôve been sleeping pretty good lately. 

It‚Äôs also really uncomfortable to sleep because of the belly. Also laying down on my back at all has me thinking I might just suffocate. Laying down and ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù gets kind of tough. You feel so bloated that it‚Äôs hard to get comfortable. I can‚Äôt sit in one position very long. 

Dry eyes and lips.

Wide spread pain. Sometimes it feels like I have the flu. I‚Äôve avoiding taking Tylenol most of my pregnancy, but have had to more this trimester. 

Some nausea came back and heartburn.",1648771220

"asianamerican","t5_2rfyw","I love this idea and you should definitely go for it. Video games are a great way of making the public more aware about these parts of our history that are often disregarded. If you can manage to make it really engaging and make the story compelling, it should be a fun enough game to play. I agree with the other commenter that it has the potential to be really depressing, but I think that if you build the story well, this should be fairly simple to work around‚Äîbut make sure not to erase the struggles of the Chinese laborers. You could maybe even have the main characters have encounters with other present Asian American groups at that time, like the Japanese laborers, settlers, and sailors in California and the Punjabi and Filipino farmers in the west, to really highlight how diverse the US was even then, and place the main characters in context. Overall, again, I would definitely play this game.",1648771220

"vaporents","t5_2upjd","""President of and Co-founder of SC Labs, Josh Wurzer, claims that ‚Äúfor what it‚Äôs worth, butane is relatively non-toxic.‚Äù SC Lab is a leading cannabis lab in California that conducted residual solvent tests to ‚Äúidentify the presence of harmful solvents, impurities, and/or other added odorants and chemicals in cannabis.‚Äù Butane was placed as a class 33 solvent, meaning it has a low toxic potential to humans. According to this study, using a butane lighter has little effect on the body.

Additionally, according to data presented by the global energy company Hess, butane is non-toxic by inhalation. However, they did find that ‚Äúinhalation of high concentrations may cause central nervous system depression such as dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and similar narcotic symptoms, but no long-term effects.‚Äù

With both of these sources considered, using a butane lighter is relatively safe in moderation.""

Wurzer has not said anything different to my knowledge

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I calculated her TDEE based on the information you gave (female, 5'2"", rounded up to 170 lbs, and light exercise of 1-2 days per week) and her maintenance calories came out as 1,993 or about 2k. They normally recommend a 500 calorie deficit for weight loss, which would be about 1.5k for her. In short, she needs to eat more.

Personally, I weigh myself daily to see how my daily meals affect my weight. That way I know what is working and what isn't. I know if I don't eat enough, don't drink enough water, drink too much dairy, or eat too late in the evening, my body holds onto the weight and I stay stagnant. If I'm on my period, I typically gain about 5 lbs, mostly water weight. I have found the only way to stop this is to work out, eat clean, and try not to consume so much sodium.

This is the hardest part about losing weight. Figuring out what actually works is such a pain. Like for other people lifting weights seems to do the trick, but unless I'm doing it wrong I don't see a change on the scale lol. It seems so easy for guys while I put in all this effort with little results. I love feeling stronger which is why I keep at it, but cardio is the only that shifts the scale for me.

This is really important to know and understand when you're talking about groups like this. It doesn't matter that it's obviously going to fail.

Reality does not matter. And if we keep thinking that it should matter, we're never going to understand them.  And we're never going to find a way to stop them.

"Christian","t5_2qjy5","&gt;What makes you believe.

Jesus is really the 'author and finisher' of my faith.  On my side, it's hard to explain but it's a 'knowing' and a 'relationship.'

I've also seen answered prayers throughout my whole life which has helped me build up trust.

&gt;and that god is the god of the bible?

As far as, why the God of the Christian bible? I've also explored other religions throughout my earlier years.  Imo some of these other religions may have valuable supplemental pieces of who God is, but I believe that the bible and faith through Jesus is the only 'True' route and can exist w/o any other pieces of other religions.

&gt;I spent 24 years in faith

I really really know that there is nothing without God and that He is in charge of getting me to the finish line as far as faith is concerned. (Jesus won't lose one of us whom he's been given). What this means for you, is that your faith journey is not done yet (sorry! :) )

&gt;Bonus question: what, if any, proof would you need to stop believing in god.

If you mean like 'aliens' or a theoretical physicist finds 'proof' that we live in a simulation? I don't think that that type of thing would be mutually exclusive to faith.  If you mean horrible stuff happening to me? God has a plan to prosper me, not to harm me.  To me illness, loss of 'stuff,' loss of loved ones even would hurt but more tend me to go *towards* God vs. away.",1648771221

"sex","t5_2qh3p","One suspects that the traumas, anxieties and fears are cultural and/or experiential in origin. You were either taught that sex was dirty/evil/dangerous and/or you had experiences that made it feel so.

OTOH, the basic desire for sex is just part of being alive.  Everyone has a libido and yours may be higher than most. 

It's obviously higher than what you feel allowed to do, thus your dilemma. You can either work on lowering your natural libido (no idea how you'd do that safely), work on dissolving the effects of that trauma, or continue as you are. 

Option 1 being non-viable and option 3 non-satisfactory leaves option 2: working on and through your sex-related traumas.

The usual and best resource for that is sex therapy.  Here's one resource:  https://www.aasect.org/

A similar resource would be a sexual surrogate or sacred intimate.  I know people who've employed such services with excellent results.",1648771221

Situationen var at de startede med ikke at ville have reklamer, men derefter ombestemte sig. Genierne gad dog ikke at fjerne klisterm√¶rkerne. 

FK bruger ogs√• selv klisterm√¶rkerne p√• en m√¶rkelig m√•de. Hvis man fx g√•r ind p√• deres hjemmeside og frav√¶lger aviser, men stadig vil have reklamer, s√• sender FK dig et bl√•t ""nej tak til det hele"" m√¶rkat som du skal sm√¶kke p√• postkassen. Hvilket er meget misvisende for omdeleren.


S√• omdelerne l√¶rer hurtigt at ignorere klisterm√¶rkerne. De er alt for up√•lidelige og misvisende.

My experience is that folks with this diagnosis often are aware that they have extreme emotional responses, that interfere with their lives and relationships.

Even if that was true, which it absolutely is not, why would that mean it should always be that way? 

Star Trek: Picard has a white male protagonist who is functionally the captain even if he‚Äôs a retired Admiral, and there are more white people represented than any other group? Are the ratios of ethnicity more important to you than anything else?

You‚Äôre wrong about ratings, too. DS9, with a black captain and a woman as his first office, beats the original series on all-time Star Trek ratings. Enterprise, with its predominantly white cast trails behind, almost last. Star Trek: Discovery has had mostly white men as captains (Lorca and Pike) and in ST:P a white man is in charge of the mission even if he doesn‚Äôt technically hold the rank of captain. So clearly there isn‚Äôt any sort of directly proportional relationship between white male command officers and a more successful show.

Both SC2 and WC3 have harass, but SC2‚Äôs is far stronger. In WC3 is more of something to do and that every work is more valuable due to the low numbers.

But it does feel odd to complain about deathballs, when that‚Äôs been a problem SC2‚Äôs faced since 2010. And still faces today.

I love BW, but it‚Äôs hard to take the lessens and benefits of its design and put them into a modern game that would have any sort of wide appeal.

there have been atleast some instances where Glitchtrap has shown to be green or somewhat associated with it... the examples I can recall are:

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; Seems more accurate, **being a conservative is a hard thing to define**, whereas being a republican is very easy to define. As republicans generally have an agreed upon set of values and moral guidelines that they believe in. Values that tend to clash pretty heavily with libertarian values

Not really, unless you're only interested in playing semantics. Modern American conservatism is very easy to define, broadly. There are various groups clashing for leadership of the party, with evangelicals currently still in charge, but otherwise they broadly support the same policies

&gt; Oddly enough there one can be conservative and pretty socially liberal 

Not really. Sexual politics is only a single aspect of social politics. Milo, Peter Thiel, Jack Donovan, Christian Walker, and other big name examples are not ""socially liberal"". They're pro-""not killing me because I'm gay"" but most of them still show extremely far-right social ideologies like anti-semitism and anti-immigration legislation. 

&gt; i.e. there is nothing preventing a homosexual person or any member of the LGBT from being a conservative. You can easily agree that the values of America are great and are worth conserving and still be a proud member of the LGBT community, you can not do the same for say christian conservatives, or republicans. Those identities would be at odds.

You described ""conservative"", a political philosophy with a pretty well-understood and thoroughly analyzed doctrine, as hard to define but then go on to talk about ""values of America"" as though they're something that can be written down in bullet points in a true-or-false test or something. American ""values"" are exceptionally and notoriously difficult to identify because it depends entirely on where you're talking about within the States and what person you're talking to. The most common answers will ""freedom"", ""freedom"", and ""more freedom"" but that's about it. 

&gt; That is a disgusting notion that not a lot of conservatives actually believe in. But alas the loudest voices on that side do tend to lean fairly heavily into that sort of less flattering mindset.

I not only disagree, but I find your faith in others to not only be naive, but laughably ahistoric. Conservatives within the States have, literally, *never* been the leading voices or voters behind social progress, acceptance, equality, or egalitarianism. Social conservatives have been the *antagonist* behind every single move for civil rights for virtually every fight on those grounds

&gt; I firmly believe that our western values are great and worth protecting because they allowed us a lot of freedoms and great things/foundations we can rely on, but I'm very socially liberal.

‚ÄãYou keep repeating this and I'm unsure whether you truly believe this is something quantifiable or just misunderstanding or conflating the definitions of these things. This is probably going to come off meaner than I intend, but this is the type of sentiment I see from college students who've watched a few too many Stefan Molyneux videos, without realizing that guy is a fucking lunatic with zero historical understanding of virtually anything.. ""Western values"" and ""conservatism"" are not tied at the hip. Being a supporter of or believer in ""western values"" in absolutely no way indicates whether someone is liberal or conservative and they don't have a lot to do with one another. 

&gt; So in a way I guess you could call me a conservative because I don't think we need to fundamentally change or uproot a lot of things about our society because they are in essence fundamentally good.

No, you're a centrist. Supporting the social status quo is, at best, socially centrist. You aren't socially liberal if you don't think there are fundamental changes we have to make 

&gt; Right let's take a complex topic like racism or LGBT acceptance as examples, I'd argue that those things are much better in the western world than anywhere else.

This has nothing to do with anything whatsoever. If the best that we can do is say, ""Well hey, we're doing better than Saudi Arabia and the Central African Republic amirite?"" then we have failed as a people and deserve whatever horrible thing happens to our society. Taking moral cues from the rest of the world is ridiculous. I don't make ethical decisions in my personal life based on what I think John Wayne Gacy would do, why in the hell should the US do that with ""anywhere else""?

&gt; But I would say that throughout our history we've developed the right kind of philosophical framework to come this far.

I won't lie to you, I have spent at least five minutes staring at this trying to even begin to know how to respond and truth be told...I've decided not to. If you've looked through American history with clarity and objectivity, and came away from that with *this* as an honest belief...then mate I'm sorry. I really don't want you on my side. 


My suspicion is you've never looked at US history through the lens of a maligned people or minority and tried to empathize, which is standard practice in the US where history is told as parable rather than through complexity and nuance. This kind of thinking can only work if you're A) on the extreme left of the social spectrum where you think extreme progressiveness is a hallmark of Western though or B) you're looking at the US through the lens of being white and straight",1648771226

But for those who want Yae to be able to target, the field time spent on a *single normal AA* is a small price to pay to have targeted damage. It doesn't have to be good. It doesn't have to be buffed. It just has to provide the desired functionality in a game that only has 3 buttons. Again, the presence of this mechanic would have absolutely zero impact on those who liked Yae pre-patch.

Sure, it's a pretty offensive thing for the teacher to use in a professional setting.

But I've always been curious about the identification factor.

How do the know it's the prophet, and not just a Middle Eastern man named Mohammad, which isn't unusual.

The entire dialog surrounding Japan's surrender was all over the place, involving political and cultural influence across multiple fronts. The Potsdam Declaration was issued on July 26th of that year, and was being debated within the Japanese political body. Surrender - and the negotiations for surrender - were very much already a thing when Hiroshima was bombed.


&gt;Except they clearly weren't ready to surrender, because even after the first nuke they said ""Nah let's not surrender.""


Right... surrender was still under negotiation, not only *within* Japan, but also with outside Allied interests. When Hiroshima was bombed, Japan didn't rise up and say with one voice, ""We'll never surrender!!!"" The ruling elite who were arguing over conditions of surrender said, ""So what? We don't really care about you guys bombing yet *another* one of our cities, so we're going to keep arguing over these conditions.""

"OndersteuningsPlein","t5_35gmr3","Hoi! Welkom hier! Allereerst moet je je problemen nooit  met die van anderen vergelijken - √ºberhaupt nooit jezelf met anderen vergelijken. Daarmee verlies je alleen maar.

Vervelend om te horen dat je dacht een oplossing gevonden te hebben voor je probleem, en dat je dan nog verder van huis lijkt. Dat moet enorm frustrerend en deprimerend zijn. Zo'n operatie lijkt vaak heel fijn; er gaat namelijk iets veranderen waar je niet blij mee bent. Maar uiteindelijk blijf je toch jezelf, en zal je dat moeten accepteren. Ik weet het helaas als geen ander.

Wellicht een rare vergelijking, maar ik had hetzelfde na mijn borstoperatie. Ik dacht ""hoera, als ik dit achter de rug ligt ben ik eindelijk mezelf en gelukkig!"". Maar ik kwam bedrogen uit. Er was weliswaar een probleem weg, maar doordat de focus daarop wegviel, zag ik ineens allerlei andere dingen waar ik ook niet zo content mee was. Wederom volgde dezelfde aanpak: als ik hormonen/operatie heb gehad, voel ik me beter. Maar net als jij herkende ik mezelf niet meer. Ik schaamde me en wilde me verstoppen. Nooit meer gezien worden.

Het enige wat uiteindelijk √©cht heeft geholpen is zelfacceptatie. Klinkt als een dooddoener, I know. En makkelijker gezegd dan gedaan. Maar alleen als je jezelf volledig ziet en accepteert voor wie je bent, kan je jezelf weer terugvinden. Jezelf weer herkennen. Jezelf weer zijn.

Wellicht dat een therapeut je hierbij kan helpen. Je huisarts weet hier vast meer over. En je kan altijd je verhaal hier kwijt, en voel je vrij me te DM'en mocht je dat willen.

"CharacterRant","t5_35frv","&gt;The League of Villains decide to abduct Bakugo to force him to join them. They got the idea from the fact he won the Sports Festival, so he is probably the strongest of the first-year students from UA. But why did they nicely try to convince him to join instead of using harsher methods? Where did they get the idea that because Bakugo is angry all the time he is perfect villain material? Why is anger related to villainy? All League members are very chill people. The fact they didn't even bother checking his background tells me that Shiragaki and co are really a bunch of idiots and over-relying on AFO to cover their asses. They do grow some backbones after AFO is apprehended, though, as seen in Season 4 where they plot the downfall of Overhaul and then steal his arms.

They didn't choose him because he won the sports festival, they chose him because he was chained to the podium. They saw an angry kid with an intense desire to win at everything being shackled by hero society. That sounds like prime villain material. Now their analysis of his personality was sorely lacking, but that's not a plot hole, that's just showing that Shigaraki isn't very good at the finer points of villainy yet

&gt;Deku approaching Kota is mind-numbing for me. It's not the fact he gets punched in the ball, but the fact he decides to do it in the first place that bothers me. Why would Deku approach the kid instead of one of the more socially active characters like Mina or Kanimari? When did Deku ever approach someone first unless they have powers/skills/experience that he hopes would make him stronger? Did the author fail to look at the character sheet to decide which character would do it?

Because Deku was the first one to see an angry kid who looked like he needed help. He's the first to approach those he thinks need saving all the time. 

&gt;Sir Nighteye's death is rather underwhelming for me considering he is the first major character to die. When Sasuke was laid low by the mirror ninja, Naruto went berserk and vowed to destroy him in return. And yet, Deku doesn't bring up how he is avenging Sir Nighteye or making sure his sacrifice is not in vain when fighting against Overhaul, which would have been a very strong motivation to defeat the villain. It is only after the fight that Deku feels remorse for being unable to protect his mentor.

1. Nighteye hadn't died yet
2. Deku's never been about revenge
3. He already had strong motivation in ""protect Eri""
4. Do you know what a plot hole is? Cause regardless of your thoughts, that's not what this is

&gt;What happened to Yuga? He was overly confident in Seasons 1 and 2. maintaining a smile even in adverse situations such as after the ULJ attack, getting cornered by Mina in the Sports Festival, and getting sucked by Thirteen in the Final Exam. I really enjoy this characteristic - it really reminds me of All Might. And then in Season 3, he seems so insecure both when the villains attack the camp (even though it was him who brought them to it since he is, in the manga, revealed to be the traitor) and during the Hero License Exam. All of a sudden, I just don't like him anymore.

Post-USJ he was already out of danger, and the sports festival and final exams were never any actual danger. (Manga spoilers) &gt;!Even though he's the traitor !&lt;(btw you should probably tag manga spoilers) his role was very limited, meaning he didn't know which villains were being sent or if those villains knew who he is, so he was in very real danger at the training camp. Plus he was also afraid that his friends would find out",1648771233

I think the huge damage TJ put out and the KD Methodz returned in Boston's first match is worth thinking about. It is almost a different team meta: fast-main and support, as opposed to a more traditional anchor-type main and flex.

Methodz is first to say that his team is responsible for his massive KD stats, and I don't think he is dissembling. He's in the mix, feeding off the comms and TJs damage, not holding down lanes. TJ isn't holding down lanes either as such; more going where the others are not, a bit like Karma did for Optic.

Pacing is really important in this COD not least because of the TTK and weird spawns, and I think it is the story of the first two majors. Many of the issues teams have faced have come from misunderstandings over how and when players should move through the maps. There is no one solution but the more successful teams have all found ways to blend their SMGs and ARs positioning and movement.

Most independents know that CRT is a non-issue, so any stance either way is just hot-button posturing. In education, if the Dem platform was to replace STAAR testing with something better they'd likely get bi-partisan support. Educators on both sides of the aisle hate STAAR, as do students, and the parents of students. 

Again, put issues that informed voters ACTUALLY care about in the platform. A healthcare public option is supported by a good majority of Americans. Student debt relief. Ending proxy wars. It's not hard to find bi-partisan support from voters, most of us are are in the same boat, dealing with the same stuff.

"Boruto","t5_34e1h","You needs to simmer down. I've been watching Boruto since the very first episode aired in April of 2017. I know what the anime is about, I've been watching.

Now,  all op said was Boruto isn't funny like OG Naurto, which it isn't. And going back to your original comment, as I stated, the show not being funny has nothing to do with Boruto being a genius. That was the original point I was replying to you about. But now you're going off in a direction the conversation was never about. 


Also, I never said I wanted Boruto to be a comedy, I was just agreeing with op point that it isn't as funny, and there's very little humor in the show. Out of 243 episode only a handfulof them had a comedy aspect to them, and if ChoCho eating chips is the comedy relief then yes the show is very dry of humor. 

And seriously tho, ""The problem is with yall who compare naruto and boruto like its the same thing"", bruh, Boruto is a part of Naruot franchise it will be compared it for everything. Hell Naruto by itself is literally compared to every shonen anime out there.
And umm,  you were also comparing Boruto being a genius and Naurto being stupid as to why Boruto isn't funny, which btw doesn't make any sense. So yeah, not matter what, comparisons between the two would always arrive. 

 And in the first place, who told you I wanted Brouto to be the same as Naruto? I made one lil comment and you're telling me what anime I should and should not watch, telling me I'm a problem and shit, like boy move. This is an discussion forum, people are allowed to discuss and compare the different animes etc.",1648771237

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I would urge you not to join a denomination before some serious research. My first recommendation to you is to read the Bible. That is the best way to learn about God because as Romans 10:17 put it: ‚Äú So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.‚Äù

Since Christianity is essentially a crime where you live, it may be hard for you to get your hands on a physical Bible, so I would search for one online. You can find a free Bible on [https://www.biblegateway.com/](https://www.biblegateway.com/)  or [https://biblehub.com/p/esv/nas/romans/1.shtml](https://biblehub.com/p/esv/nas/romans/1.shtml)  I would recommend reading the ESV, since it‚Äôs relatively easy to read for modern people and it‚Äôs a word for word translation.

Now, if you‚Äôre wondering where to start, I would start with the Gospel of John or Romans. These two books will grow your faith greatly. Don‚Äôt start reading the Old Testament first. From experience, it could be overwhelming to start with the Old Testament since it is humongous. First, start with the Gospels and then read Paul‚Äôs Epistles, Acts, and Revelation. Then you can truly understand a lot of the context of the Old Testament.

I decided to read the Bible on when I was at my lowest; that‚Äôs when I became a Christian. I am now a nondenominational Christian who only reads the Bible, and I trust in Christ alone, not preachers, not the churches, and not other humans. For humans will always fail you, but God never will. And this has changed my life entirely.

I think you will find peace in it. Christianity is about Christ, not what other denominations, humans, or even the churches say. I will put down a few of the verses that really resonated with me when I first became a Christian.

John 15:9

As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.

&amp;#x200B;

John 8:34-36

Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin. The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Matthew 11:28

Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

Matthew 5:43-45

You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.‚Äô But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

John 8:12

I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.

Galatians 28:13

There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

1 Corinthians 13:13

So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

Remember that God loves you, and that though you may not see it yet, he loves you no matter who you are or where you are from. He loves you purely because you are his creation, and you are of infinite value to him. ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.‚Äù (John 3:16-17)

Suicide is not the answer. You are a temple of God, so you are worthy to be loved. Please call a helpline if you are considering suicide and get help. There‚Äôs no shame in asking for help if you need it.

I hope this response helped you. May God bless you, and if you have any questions at all, please feel free to ask. And if you want to learn about who Christ was, you should read the Bible yourself. For Christ is the only mediator, and no denomination or church should replace that.

So may peace be upon you, and grace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.",1648771238

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","The four problems with welfare capitalism are:

1. It relies on the goodwill of the bourgeoisie; they can decide to no longer fund it. Contrast: publicly owned means of production, where no one person or group of people owns them. While it's not necessarily hard to convince people to vote against their own interests, a democratically-managed, publicly-controlled means of production is still much more resilient than the whims of a small group of rich people.
2. Welfare capitalism doesn't actually replace capitalism as a system; while capitalism was a net upgrade to feudalism (Economy 2.0! Now without Divine Right‚Ñ¢!), socialism is, in many ways beyond the scope of this comment, a net upgrade to capitalism (Economy 3.0! 100% less Bourgeoisie!). As such, welfare capitalism is basically keeping a less-functional system around and trying to retrofit it. Sounds good, but this leads me to the third point:
3. Capitalism is unsustainable. Eventually, it will hit the maximum of what it's capable of, because, as I enumerated above, it's based off of constant growth - the second it can no longer grow, it collapses. Capitalism is designed for maximum growth in minimum time for the purpose of value production; the problem is that it causes a massive concentration of wealth in the hands of a few people, and begins using up scarce resources once it gets to a *really* big scale. On the other hand, socialism is *capable* of throttling up and down - not necessarily very well, but it can. Technically speaking, a closed system is impossible in the very long run, but technological advancement can probably outpace socialism's growth rate long enough for humanity to, I dunno, upload ourselves into computers.
4. Socialism is healthier for people in particular and society in general. Sure, it grows value more slowly, but that's because people have more access to everything from education to contraceptives - lower birth rates, less pollution, better healthcare leading to more productivity, etc. It wastes less and doesn't have as much of a growth rate as capitalism - no wasted food being bulldozed into dumps, no Amazon reject packages getting thrown into dumpsters, etc. It's not that people go without food (yes, I know the jokes), or even services such as Amazon; it's that demand for such things flattens out rapidly and therefore means less growth is *required* to be just as happy as under capitalism.

&amp;#x200B;

Welfare capitalism, like many things, is a good stopgap solution, but not what people need in the long run.",1648771238

But let's say that there was some way for your body to know that. This hypothesis still has a huge problem, because natural selection only cares about an organism's ability to reproduce, not its quality of life. A gene that keeps some of the people who have it from reproducing will only ever become widespread in a population if it makes everyone else with the gene *way more* likely to reproduce successfully. There is a plausible mechanism for this with other theories of how homosexuality could have evolved, e.g., that having gay siblings around increases the odds of your children's survival. But for your theory, this would require a world in which mentally ill families are *so* destructive that it keeps other families from reproducing--and specifically other families who happen to have this same ""gay if you're mentally ill"" gene, just lying dormant because they aren't mentally ill. And I just don't see any argument for how that's the case in our world.

The real answer to why gay people have high rates of mental illnesses is just that, obviously, they are discriminated against and discrimination is a significant form of stress that can lead to the development of mental illness.",1648771240

I wish there were just a META tab that would show all squads forming for all metas and show which map they are on. Same with an events tab for other events, as some are worth doing as much as some metas.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","People in general are entirely too soft in how they DM. Yes, it's true that the correct level of challenge is however challenging your specific table finds fun, however I've noticed that in GENERAL the way people talk about DMing isn't challenging enough. There's a massive emphasis on fudging rolls in favor of the player, or saying AC is lower than it is, or removing hit points from a big boss if it's too hard-and I think that's a bunch baloney. 

In 5E especially, it's very easy to make a strong character while still playing what you want, but it's true of most editions. It's **always** more satisfying to struggle against things, to get your ass handed to you a couple times, to maybe even almost die, so that way when you do get stronger and level up it's more rewarding when you go back and kick that things ass.

Also, on a related note, character death should not be avoided. It shouldn't be sought after, but why even have HP if every DM ever is going to do everything in their (omnipotent) power to make sure your character doesn't die? The risk of death is what makes the game fun, it's what makes the story interesting.",1648771241

Hello there, I am whose, a full time composer &amp; producer for the audio drama, known as ClockTower: clocktoweragent.com Through working on this show, which is currently on its 40th episode, I have handcrafted theme songs for not only numerous characters and scenes, but full worlds. Medieval Fantasy towns, sprawling space stations, adventurous pirate romps, and even noir detective mysteries.  
For $100 I will compose a custom theme for you D&amp;D / TTRPG character, fully tracked instrumental, (and created so that it can be looped easily for long form campaigns and battles) with a 2-3 day turnaround and one revision. Any added revisions will be another $20 dollars.  
Pictured here is art of a  Giant Hammer Wielding Barbarian designed by @/El-Geron commissioned for @/Loicbuthod. They asked for a hard metal riff and pulsing drums, so I naturally had to deliver.

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","I have a much smaller guest list, but similar situation to you in that several of the guests who would have been able to attend the 2020 wedding, cannot attend the 2022 wedding. To put it frankly, we have an older crowd, and several relatives have passed away since 2020, or are in such ill-health they may not be able to attend (but could have attended 2 years ago). It sucks, and is part of the reason we don‚Äôt want to postpone anymore, even though in many respects the world is still more broken than it was in 2019. 

My florist just told me we will have to make adjustments to my bouquet due to supply chain issues, but whatever we end up doing, it will be ok. Know why? Because whatever it is, it will be the real bouquet I hold in my hands for my wedding day.

I had to start thinking of the 2020 wedding that never happened as a ‚Äúdead‚Äù wedding.  Some of the vendors I was using in 2020 went under during the pandemic.  Others changed their offerings or services. Life circumstances changed for so many.  But thinking of this wedding as a separate entity from the one I am planning now has really helped me.

This still wasn't the point of the video though. It was mentioned by one of the staffers and just briefly glossed over. I just watched it AGAIN to be sure and no one is taking any hard stance.

Took the school bus until I was 17 and could drive myself and had a job after school/weekends/summers working at Target and a restaurant. Stayed at the restaurant job for a pretty long time since they let me come back when I was home from college in the summer.

In fact I myself have never heard of anything purity-related irl growing up despite going to a Chinese baptist church. I only learned of purity culture as a teenager via the internet. 

Here's another related [essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/purity-culture-evangelical-church-harms-women/618438/)  which was quoted by this article which is also another great read.",1648771244
"Buttcoin","t5_2sngy","&gt; Like you say, it's a distribution problem. It doesn't inherently invalidate the idea, just imposes challenges on implementation. That's not a problem so much as an opportunity to innovate.

It doesn't just impose challenges, it means the solution is something else entirely. E.g. OTP's security in practice can only ever be as good as the security of distributing the keys. And if you have secure key distribution, then OTP isn't adding much additional value in the first place.

Likewise, with cryptocurrencies the ability of the network to operate trustlessly is in practice largely dependent on traditional security concerns / solutions, and if those are secure / designed well then the ""trustless"" aspect of the network isn't actually adding that much.

&gt; You need systems of interlocking trust and authorities which can regulate and certify, that's true. Those systems do not however need to be centrally-administered or controlled however. Let's not confuse a certifying authority with the body that controls it - they are two different things that some people keep conflating into one.

I partially agree, but the dependency on _any_ third-party trust largely negates the point of using a cryptocurrency-style blockchain in the first place versus other technologies with fewer drawbacks.

The CA web-of-trust used to secure TLS is a prime example, and one upon which cryptocurrencies ironically already fundamentally depend (if nothing else, then to associate a wallet address with an identity).

&gt; Finality in no way prevents you from implementing systems of recourse among market participants

But only if you build systems that explicitly bypass the blockchain in some form - which is exactly what we've been seeing e.g. with exchanges or central API provider blacklists.

The chain itself by nature can only be authoritative over things that are on-chain, which categorically excludes much of what people actually care about (such as goods and services purchased, or enforcing that the wallet's legal owner spent the money and not a thief that gained access to the wallet).

&gt; and it makes you consider who you're doing business with (and how) far more than the system we have today.

This is equivalent to blaming users when a service is compromised for storing passwords in plaintext instead of the service for having a bad design.

Existing systems struggle with fraud as it is, cryptocurrencies make the problem worse by having even fewer ways to effectively deal with most common forms of it.

&gt; Again, you're describing problems inherent in a system which lacks the security and regulatory mechanisms it will need in its finaly implementation

And how do you propose those be added without undermining or bypassing the central premise of a trustless network? Again, this is really begging the question of what value is being added by the technology in the first place.",1648771244

If you wish to stick around, please feel free to comment in our Daily Bark threads, pinned to the top of the sub, to introduce yourself, your dog, and talk about all the little things which may not require a full post to discuss. Thanks for reading and enjoy your stay!

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","I strongly disagree. Imo the shows work best as their own thing. It lessens what they are by making them part of the MCU all along since it raises many questions of where these characters were during all the other major events in the MCU after the attack on New York.

I basically see the Netflix shows as like the adult range of Marvel comics that aren‚Äôt directly connected to the mainstream Marvel comics. 

Clearly those aren‚Äôt going to fit well into the much more family friendly MCU so what we see next will be toned down version of those characters who will just jump into a new adventure with little to no mention of the events that occurred in the Netflix series.

I personally have no problems with two distinct takes on the same character played by the same actor though i know I‚Äôm in the minority with that one, but i strongly suspect this is exactly what Disney+ is going for‚Ä¶that said I‚Äôm sure many will still manage to find convoluted ways how it can all still be connected.

*****
&gt; Russian troops that took over the Chornobyl nuclear power plant last month have transferred control back to Ukraine, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Thursday, citing information from Ukraine.

&gt; Multiple convoys of Russian troops in the area have also moved back toward Kremlin-allied Belarus on Ukraine&amp;#039;s northern border, Kyiv told the IAEA. The Russian forces, which had held the nuclear facility since Feb. 24, &amp;quot;In writing&amp;quot; returned control of the Chornobyl plant to Ukrainian personnel, the IAEA said in a press release.

&gt; Ukraine reported that there are still some Russian forces on the Chornobyl NPP site but presumed that those forces are preparing to leave,&amp;quot; the IAEA statement said.

The most sexy thing in the world is a lover who desires you physically.   When a woman is pleasing herself, it sends a strong message that she is at least interested in sex.  It's not uncommon for men to worry that their partner does not want sex.  This is a powerful fear because if that were true, then the sex act is basically a kind of institutionalized torture for your wife.   It's a lose-lose for both partners.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Something about this story is very off.

Typically for women as far as your wife was along (3 months + whatever time before she discovered her pregnancy which is at least another month and usually closer to 6 weeks so she'd be solidly in her second trimester) most doctors recommend a D&amp;C which is done under general anesthesia, and hospitals *always* require general anesthesia patients have someone who can take them home and stay with them because of the risk of complications. They won't release you to a cab or rideshare, and they certainly won't let you drive yourself.

So either there's something false in this story,  your wife wasn't really pregnant/wasn't as far along as she claimed she was or (hopefully not) a karma farming story, or if your wife is telling the truth about the pregnancy she faced a situation where *someone* in her group of family and friends brought her home from the hospital and *you weren't the one she called*.",1648771250

But if someone chooses to risk becoming pregnant, I do believe the ""right"" answer is bringing that life into the world, whether they choose to raise it or adopt it to a good home. We're in an age where we're not ignorant about what can and cannot prevent pregnancy.

But again, I don't have to live with the decision that's made, and while I don't agree with it, I also wouldn't hold it over their head.

For context, I spent the first four years of my adult career in the military. It took me a long time to come to a point where I could talk about things I did over there. I'm not ashamed of my choices, at least not anymore, because those choices are why I'm even alive to share my opinions, popular or not, with internet strangers.

I had to end lives, to preserve my own, to preserve the lives of people that trusted me to help get us all home safely. I have a very healthy respect for the gift of life, and I think the idea of ""abortion for convenience,"" is an abhorrent one.

The right believes the status quo emerges through natural instinct and entropy, and that even when they aren't happy with the status quo no one can be trusted to enforce and machinate it.

"churning","t5_2vrf0","Hello,

I got disabled about a year ago and now have to travel for medical reasons. I have about 90k on my chase Sapphire preferred and 15k points on Amazon Chase. I also have a bofa premium rewards and the blue bofa travel card.

My disability requires that I have a flat bed, so I need a business class ticket that provides a bed (I never flew business before)

What is the best way to redeem my points to the most amount of money. I read the chase portal doesn't offer the best prices and isn't as safe if something occurs as buying str8 from an airline.

I also have cognitive issues due to my illness, so please provide any advice even if you think it is common sense.

Thank you all",1648771252

Some constantly like to mention they are veterans and some like to mention how much they care about veterans. There's also this implied notion (again, in MY perception) that the mere mention that someone is a veteran implies they somehow have better moral values and deserve special treatment. 

To me it's rather an issue that we, as a country, have so many veterans and they didn't come out of WW2. Not to mention we stopped mandatory conscription many years ago so having the possibility of being a veteran today is a choice (and sadly, for many, the only choice which is another issue).",1648771252

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Man, I'm really curious where you're from because my husband and I can easily spend $80 at a place like Outback, if we get drinks and dessert (and Outback is pretty far from a high end place). $80 for 3 people means at least $10 in tip. I could see that if everyone only orders an entree, but the moment you start getting a drink, side, or dessert, it would be tough to find a high end place in that low of a budget. Drinks (the alcoholic kind) are usually easily $8-$16 on their own, which would drop the entree price below $20 per person. If you share a starter or dessert, that's easily another $10+. 

Drinks for 3 people (I'm assuming around $12 per) is about $36  
A shared appetizer is generously around $10  
Tip would need to be at least $10  
That leaves $8 for an entree

If you don't drink, that does make it much more believable, but considering it's really common to have a drink while out with friends at a nice place, it feels like your budget wouldn't be representative of a standard night out at a nice place. 

Here's a few places I would consider high end near me:

[El Gaucho](https://elgaucho.com/elgauchoportland/) (cheapest starter is $14, cheapest entree is the half chicken for $35, cheapest drink is $16)

[Portland City Grill](https://portlandcitygrill.com/) (cheapest starter is $16, cheapest drink is $9 and cheapest entree is $31)

[Higgins](https://higginsportland.com/) (cheapest starter is bread for $5, cheapest drink is $6 for a can of Stella, cheapest entree is $26)

Even at the cheaper end of the high end restaurants would strain an $80 budget for 3 people. At the nicer places, some entrees alone are around $80 for just the one plate. 

I know I've probably gone overboard with this comment, but it's really weird to me that you think $100 for a single person means that someone is getting a ridiculous amount of food at a high end place. It's incredibly easy to do, especially if it's a place where you pay separately for sides and/or the serving sizes are tiny because high end places often don't aim to load you up with food, since the focus is on very high quality ingredients and very involved cooking techniques. Getting 3 or 4 courses at a nice place is often less total food than a single entree at places like Olive Garden.",1648771253

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Landlords are an interesting case however - their costs are primarily their mortgage and the interest rate (assuming they don't own outright) and there will be a proportion of rent that needs to be set aside for maintenance and repairs - so those costs rising would have an impact.

The vast majority of increases in rent have nothing to do with the landlord's costs, but rather perception of 'what the market is doing' - which is a message coming from property managers or investor's associations who have a vested interest in colluding to increase rents.

I would agree that minimum wage rising would have an impact on businesses who have minimum wage staff, and that could have a flow-on effect to their costs and thus their prices - however most parts of our economy don't have a direct connection between cost and price.  Businesses raise prices when they think others are doing it so they aren't 'missing out'...rather than to maintain a specific level of mark-up.",1648771253

I don't care about my value to society. But people always say ""xyz doesn't determine your worth as a person."" Then what the hell does? It's completely subjective! Beyond that, the factors that dictate someone's ""worth"" are different to society, to their communities, to their bosses, to themselves. Concepts like this are useless.

""Virtue"" really just means conformity to society's values, which change easily. Even the kinds that people are so convinced are universal. There are no objective virtues.

I have ADHD and Borderline personality disorder. I've had a rough life. 

My parents are divorced and we're talking about my dad's family. My dad is never present .My grandma and grandpa are like parents to me because I've had a tricky situation at home with my mom during my 18-20's and I lived with them.

I've been diagnosed as an adult and it has been a huge relief because I have so much trauma and guilt I can't handle myself properly anymore. During my childhood I've always been flaired as 'problematic' (I was bullied in school but I actually defended myself by fists so teachers always blamed on me). No one helped me. When my parents divorced they took me to a therapist (I was 7) and I mocked her during sessions so my family use that as an excuse for me not getting proper help. I has always been stigmatized and despite all that and without any emotional or professional help I kinda made it.

I have a love-hate relationship with my family, specially with one aunt.She's the kind of person that thinks if you are poor is because you don't work enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Her son has dyslexia and has dealt his whole life with bad grades. We've always been lectured not to bother him about anything and she has made everyone to treat him like glass. A few summers ago he and 2 of his friends recorded me working out (he was 13) and laughed at me. I was super ashamed, and furious because I have body image issues so I went off and called him a bully. His mom said I was over reacting and didn't punish him. I forgave him bc he was 13 and I don't hold grudges even if things hurt me and he has truly matured.

Now, the issue.

We were having dinner and I was explaining to one of my uncles my diagnosis and how excited I was of getting on meds bc I'm struggling to focus and work. Said uncle took my side during the conflict because he has always been like my big brother.

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt  just started saying how impossible it was I had ADHD and how I was making excuses for my past mistakes and outbursts by saying all that. I just went ballistic. I told her to fuck off, I told her how selfish and disgusting she was, how she always made us treat her son like he was made of glass for having dyslexia and how she was disrespecting my mental health ONCE AGAIN. Her husband, my uncle, told me to calm down and I wasn't able. I just told them how much they are to blame even tho they love to brag about how they helped me because my parents were shitty parents. I told them how they always stigmatized me and how sick I was of them. I just left in tears and my sister came with me and reassured me.

&amp;#x200B;

My other cousin (my aunt's daughter) is studying to become a therapist and she remained silent the whole time, and that hurt me a lot too.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandma is on my side because she can't tolerate my aunt anymore (her DIL) but my uncle thinks I'm an AH and is expecting an apology i'm not giving.

&gt; Russian troops that took over the Chornobyl nuclear power plant last month have transferred control back to Ukraine, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Thursday, citing information from Ukraine.

&gt; Multiple convoys of Russian troops in the area have also moved back toward Kremlin-allied Belarus on Ukraine&amp;#039;s northern border, Kyiv told the IAEA. The Russian forces, which had held the nuclear facility since Feb. 24, &amp;quot;In writing&amp;quot; returned control of the Chornobyl plant to Ukrainian personnel, the IAEA said in a press release.

&gt; Ukraine reported that there are still some Russian forces on the Chornobyl NPP site but presumed that those forces are preparing to leave,&amp;quot; the IAEA statement said.

"stocks","t5_2qjfk","I'm relatively smooth-brained as well, but my understanding is that every shareholder receives the dividend for each share owned, whether that be a stock distribution, cash dividend, or other special dividend. Regardless of whether your shares have been loaned out, you're entitled to the dividend as a shareholder. Anyone who holds a short position in the stock on the ex-dividend date is obligated to fulfill the dividend payment to the lender of shares. 

I'm interested in speculating on the outcome of a special dividend NFT. This is all conjecture so put your tinfoil hat on. I'd love to see the board offer a special dividend of sorts, e.g. a NFT token for their upcoming marketplace. With NFTs existing as their own commodities on various exchanges, a special dividend NFT could theoretically hold enormous value on another marketplace. If that turned out to be the case, it could further drive the stock price as the ex-dividend date approaches, as the value of that special dividend could become reflected in the stock price. You'd obviously not want to be responsible for delivering this theoretically high-value dividend to the lender of shares for your short position, if you held one. You'd be incentivized to cover your short position, and quickly, as the value of the theoretical special dividend NFT could explode for whatever reason. Sounds like a recipe for a squeeze.",1648771255

"rupaulsdragrace","t5_2t3or","oh yeah absolutely but i think you can't really give a one fits all definition for gender and i was mainly trying to explain why identifying as a nonbinary trans person and nonbinary ""female"" are oxymoronic, at least in trinity's case. sadly, a lot of nuance gets lost that way but gender identity is a complex thing and on an individual level, there are few things that aren't possible. 

i absolutely get your point about disliking using male und female as nouns, people who do that unironically are either neckbeards or sarah j maas, but i used it once in my original post and just now because op did to, sorry about that.

your feelings about embracing feminity but only on your own terms really resonate with me, im not uncomfortable at all with identifying as a cis woman but only because my family and friends don't try to force certain gender stereotypes on me that i disagree with or don't really vibe with; but if that wasn't the case and my upbringing had been more similar to yours, id probably also reject that label for myself and refuse to check myself into the woman box.",1648771255

I think a lot of it is just because he's so passionate about his interests and most/all of his fans are into some of those interests as well.

I don't want to say that fans of something like Tested are smarter on average or anything than fans of say - a video game streamer or some music artist - because that's really pretentious and annoying.

This logic serves no purpose, a woman who is 7 in looks will not want to fuck a man who is even 8 in looks but can‚Äôt for the love of god make her laugh: she will not fuck you dude and you have no right to fuck her.

You are gonna pay more for CDT's than BDT's as far as terps are concerned, but the mixes contain other cannabinoids like CBD, CBG and CBN, which will give you more of a full spectrum feel.  Buying them all in bulk separately ends up being cheaper in the long run, but is a larger cost up front.

My parents contributed to my social anxiety and we both know how Moroccan parents deal with mental health, it's a taboo and my parents thought the same.
What I mean to say is, you should just try to talk to your parents about it and plan for a visit to a therapist. My parents became super supportive afterwards and I'm now on the right track of recovery, it can be the same for you.

"Residency","t5_2t8qv","PGY1 salary 56k, monthly take home is around  $3500 (not married, no kids). My biggest expense is mortgage payment of $1650 which includes insurance/tax and is for a 350k house with a $0 down physician loan. That leaves $1850 a month.

\-$250 utilities/internet

\-$250 groceries (coffee/lunch at hospital)  


\-$300 Roth IRA (this is only $3600/year toward the $6500 max)

\-$100 on gas (this was 3 tanks, now it's only 2 and I'm spending more like $150...)

\-$50 car insurance  


\-$100 food/toys/treats for two dogs  


\-$250 to savings (for home expenses, christmas presents for family, new tires, vet bills, etc.)

That leaves about $550, which is usually more than I need for any other expenses (toiletries, makeup, fast food/Starbucks, dinners out, oil change, random home purchases, pedicures, hair appointments, clothes, etc.). When I have extra, I put it in savings, add to my Roth, or send it to the principle on my mortgage. I don't have a car payment and my parents still pay my cell phone bill since it's on a family plan.

For example, you're suggesting that someone in 2013 to become a member of that club had to invest $5K at once.  Don't you think someone who believed in Bitcoin in 2013 and bought a few whole coins wouldn't have continued to accumulate more coins in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016...?  What are the chances someone would believe in it enough to gamble $1K of their savings on it in 2013, and then never buy any more coins after that...?  

I firmly believe that anyone who learned about Bitcoin in 2013 and put in anywhere close to $1K into it that year definitely continued to buy more coins in the following years, and by now their holdings in most cases would exceed $1MM (if they were smart about it).",1648771257

I, of course, ignored him and proceeded to continue walking towards the exit of the campus. For whatever reason, this classmate decided to prove to me it wasn't that loud by **PRYING MY HANDS** away from my head so that I would uncover my ears. I don't exactly remember my reaction to this, but I think I just made a face and moved to get him off of me, and continued to walk towards the exit.

*****
&gt; Russian troops that took over the Chornobyl nuclear power plant last month have transferred control back to Ukraine, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Thursday, citing information from Ukraine.

&gt; Multiple convoys of Russian troops in the area have also moved back toward Kremlin-allied Belarus on Ukraine&amp;#039;s northern border, Kyiv told the IAEA. The Russian forces, which had held the nuclear facility since Feb. 24, &amp;quot;In writing&amp;quot; returned control of the Chornobyl plant to Ukrainian personnel, the IAEA said in a press release.

&gt; Ukraine reported that there are still some Russian forces on the Chornobyl NPP site but presumed that those forces are preparing to leave,&amp;quot; the IAEA statement said.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I'm guessing the bubble is from a sizeable amount of home supply left unoccupied and are mostly speculative assets bought up by individuals or corporations across the country. When the market goes south I foresee many of these homes coming to market.

My view is that it was easier to ramp up prices through inflated buying pressures from ""wealthy"" speculators than from a sudden influx of new ""qualified"" home buyers during an environment of severely decreased economic activity from the 2020 pandemic to our now higher highs in inflation. Where is the money coming from to pay for these inflated home prices and for how long? Foreclosures may be a thing and add more deflationary pressure.",1648771258

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Something use in my games as DM is the homebrewed ""sprint"" mechanic. Its a mechanic I saw on a youtube video a while ago which has really helped with mobility problems.

Basically you give up all of your turn (action and bonus action) to run 5x your movement speed. The idea is the average healthy person should be able to make it at least 150 ft if they sprint full tilt for ~10 seconds. That then follows that an adventurer of above average physique could make it 150 ft in 6 sec if they really tried. You could also make this variable with athletics and/or CON as well.

This is an idea me and my group have been enjoying since we implemented it. I find it makes mobility-heavy combat encounters feel way less clunky and also figure if you were in a battle you could easily cover way more than just 30 ft (60 with dash) considering adrenaline, the average human physique, etc.",1648771258

If she would just explain that his employment/financial situation is the reason she is hesitant to move in and combine finances, that would be completely valid. He should be able to address those concerns. I‚Äôve been in a similar situation with a partner who was extremely laid back, didn‚Äôt want to work, misrepresented his finances, and was fairly lazy. I had Noi‚Äôs same perspective on it. Someone who chooses to lay around while neglecting to step up household responsibilities is not only unattractive to me, but I think that also speaks to their character. It isn‚Äôt so much about the money per se, but more so dealing with someone who seems apathetic without any clear goals/passions. I think Noi is saying she just wants to see some drive and ambition in her spouse, which is reasonable. Her problem is not being mature enough to communicate the issues.

"emotionalneglect","t5_2zgyv","I believe it. I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs some kind of non-verbal communication. Posture, eye contact (or not), tone of voice, speed - of speaking, of gestures, also space/volume - how much room are you comfortable taking up, how loud are you comfortable projecting your voice? Etc. it might not necessarily be that you‚Äôre projecting an unconfident presence; there could be more of an inconsistency about you - confident in some ways, unconfident in others - that bothers people &amp; makes them want to challenge your position.

I‚Äôve been working on my confidence lately and made progress. People have been responding to me better when I go out and I feel more comfortable. I don‚Äôt really recommend trying to just change your body language, but observe, see what it‚Äôs communicating about your frame of mind, and then work on the way you think about that issue.

Personal bodily differences aside there is more at work behind a lot of these experiences but for cannabis withdrawal to be comparable to opiates, I think there might be more going on because that's not a normal response, I know a lot of people who have used opiates and have never had this kind of reaction when consuming cannabis. I do have a friend who smoked a joint laced with cocaine once and ever since, he has been unable to smoke cannabis in flower form because it gives him a psychosomatic effect that's like a flashback to smoking that laced joint, but he can smoke hash no problem, I imagine there's a similar mechanism at work if people experience worse than opiate withdrawals with cannabis.

It is quite literally the same thing.

You are buying a product (renting, to be more specific) that will do what you ask without you having any responsibility to give it back unless that is part of your kink.

Good luck trying to get that from your average drunk Fuck-Joe in a pub.

You pay for the illusion. The good ones manage to fake it like they are enjoying it.

Also you pay for the person to leave you in peace.

Look at the name of the sub. This is obviously someone trying to get the sex they crave while still married. Basically cheating with an escort.

The advantage is getting your sex when you are available (that odd hour that you were supposed to go to the gym) and not having the person catching feelings, showing up at your door, or confronting your spouse.

But more importantly, not having you catching feelings.

For those without a way out, it is valid.

"Pottery","t5_2re38","Great answer. One other thing it could be is stuff coming off of other pots in the kiln. I am talking about if it is really closely packed, like only a cm apart and there is something specific in the other pots' glazes. I have used a few crater-y glazes with chrome or other minerals, and if you have stuff too close in the firing, some colour offgases or something and makes shadows on pieces nearby. I don't know if this picture shows that, but it almost looks like a shadow cast, like as if another pot blocked it in some areas.

Or, in a gas kiln (or just a very close packed electric fired with peeps closed the whole time) could do things with differences in oxidation/reduction that affect it. Where air flow is minimal in between pots compared to around other areas, that might lead to a change in the clay body colour. For example, Iron molecules change colours depending on the ratio of oxygen to iron in them (fe203 is rusty red, fe304 is black). 

So maybe the lighter areas were close to other pots and didnt get the same level of oxidation in the firing. Putting things with more space between them would help with this.",1648771263

"recht","t5_2zv9z","b) Rechtsfolgen der ¬ß 648 S. 2 BGB und ¬ß 648 S. 3 BGB

6Die Rechtsfolgen
Der ¬ß¬ß 648 S. 2, S. 3 BGB dienen der Vorteilsausgleichung und zielen darauf ab, zwischen den widerstreitenden Interessen des Bestellers und des Unternehmers einen gerechten Ausgleich herbeizuf√ºhren.15¬†Die Vorschriften stellen sicher, dass der Unternehmer keine Nachteile durch die K√ºndigung erleiden soll.16¬†Zugleich garantieren sie allerdings auch, dass der Unternehmer keine Vorteile durch die K√ºndigung zieht.17¬†

aa) Rechtsfolgen des ¬ß 648 S. 2 BGB

7Durch die freie K√ºndigung des Bestellers wird der Unternehmer f√ºr die Zukunft von seiner Leistungspflicht befreit.18¬†Da der Unternehmer keinerlei Einfluss auf die freie K√ºndigung durch den Besteller hat, regelt ¬ß 648 S. 2 BGB zum Schutze des Unternehmers, dass diesem im Falle einer freien K√ºndigung des Bestellers ein Anspruch auf die Verg√ºtung zusteht. Hierbei ist zwischen einer Verg√ºtung f√ºr bereits erbrachte Leistungen und einer Verg√ºtung f√ºr noch nicht erbrachte Leistungen unterschieden werden.

(1) Verg√ºtung von erbrachten Leistungen

8F√ºr die bereits erbrachten Leistungen beh√§lt der Unternehmer den diesbez√ºglichen Verg√ºtungsanspruch.19¬†Das bedeutet, dass der Unternehmer f√ºr das teilweise erbrachte Werk eine Teilverg√ºtung geltend machen kann. Diese bestimmt sich nach¬†¬ß 645 BGB. Die Teilverg√ºtung entspricht dem Anteil des bereits teilweise errichteten Werks im Verh√§ltnis zum Gesamtwerk.20¬†
Hinsichtlich der im Zeitpunkt der K√ºndigung noch nicht erbrachten Leistungen kann der Unternehmer eine anteilige Verg√ºtung abz√ºglich der ersparten Aufwendungen geltend machen,21¬†so dass ihm letztlich eine Kompensation seines entgangenen Gewinns zusteht.22¬†

(2) Verg√ºtung von noch nicht erbrachten Leistungen

9Zur Bestimmung der Verg√ºtungsh√∂he ist wie folgt vorzugehen: Zun√§chst muss die Gesamtverg√ºtung f√ºr die erbrachten und die nicht erbrachten Leistungen ermittelt werden. Sofern keine Pauschalverg√ºtung vereinbart wurde, obliegt es dem Unternehmer, die Gesamtverg√ºtungsh√∂he darzulegen.23¬†Hiervon ist die Teilverg√ºtung, die bereits f√ºr die get√§tigten Leistungen erbracht werden muss, abzuziehen. Die verbliebende Verg√ºtung verringert sich um die H√∂he der entsprechenden Umsatzsteuer, da diese nicht mehr zu entrichten ist.24¬†Von der verbliebenden Verg√ºtung sind zudem die ersparten Aufwendungen und der Erwerb aus anderweitigen Verwendung der Arbeitskraft abzuziehen. Ersparte Aufwendungen sind Aufwendungen, die der Unternehmer infolge der Nichtausf√ºhrung des Vertrages nunmehr nicht mehr t√§tigt. Ein Erwerb aus anderweitiger Verwendung der Arbeitskraft ist jeder Erwerb, der zweifelsfrei durch die K√ºndigung des Bestellers verursacht worden ist.25¬†Es bedarf eines urs√§chlichen Zusammenhangs zwischen der K√ºndigung des Werkvertrages und der Erteilung des Ersatzauftrags.26¬†

bb) Rechtsfolgen des ¬ß 648 S. 3 BGB

10¬ß 648 S. 3 BGB beinhaltet die gesetzliche Pauschale, dass dem Unternehmer zumindest 5 % der Teilverg√ºtung f√ºr die noch nicht erbrachten Leistungen zustehen. Grundlage der Berechnung ist folglich nicht die Gesamtverg√ºtung. Bezugspunkt ist vielmehr die Teilverg√ºtung f√ºr die noch nicht erbrachten Leistungen, die nach den oben beschriebenen Grundlagen zu berechnen sind.


[Quelle](https://bgb.kommentar.de/Buch-2/Abschnitt-8/Titel-9/Untertitel-1/Kapitel-1/Kuendigungsrecht-des-Bestellers/Definitionen)


Als Schadensersatz w√ºrde ich es schon deshalb nicht bezeichnen, da ja kein Schaden entstanden ist. Die Aufwendungen des Schuldners m√ºssen diesem ersetzt werden. Da der Schuldner diese Aufwendungen im Rahmes des noch bestehenden Werkvertrags get√§tigt hat, sind es Aufwendungen, welche auch nach dem Werkvertragsrecht verg√ºtet werden m√ºssen.",1648771263

My (f24) husband (m24) and I have been together for 2 years.  Last week we accidently swapped phones in the midst of getting ready for work (same model and phone case).  At first it wasn't a big deal as we generally use it to communicate with each other and in case of emergency at daycare (we have a 4 month old son).

Mid day he gets persistent texts from Christine.  I know she is his friend though I have never met her. I shoot her a quick lol sorry he does not have his phone text and explain we swapped and he will get it back after work.

She asks who I am.  I am confused.  I say I am his wife.  She goes on a rant about being in love with him and apparently she had no idea me nor our son existed.

I accused him of cheating but he says he hasn't and that they only ever communicate via phone and he only met up with her in person once before he ever met me (they met online and she lives 2 states away).

He is telling me I am being an asshole not to trust him and that I am being unfair but I am so confused why if she is only his friend I never existed in his life to her.

So AITA for accusing him of cheating?

Some Mfm do consult only and never go into an OR. Others actually still do deliveries but then their surgery is going to be limited to obstetric things. 
Another option is a laborist. I hear you as I never looked at myself as a surgeon when I started med school and used to get super nervous in the OR. But it‚Äôs all about training. I literally just spent all this morning doing hysterectomies and loved it !

Personally I played one for a real short time (campaign came to a semi natural end) and she loved her teammates and would help them plenty because she realized she couldn't achieve what she was after on her own. She wanted to destroy the phylactery of a lich to basically usurp him and become a lich in that area. Now, a lowly level 10 (what I started at) all alone isn't going to do much to that end. However, the group that's all ""We need to kill this evil lich!"" Absolutely was more than willing to take her into their party to help kill this absolutely evil guy. 

There was good roleplay. But I really think it is also a matter of having a good party for it. The party I was in was very chaotic anyway, so a character that was intelligently evil really didn't stick out.",1648771266

*****
&gt; When a Russian tank army swept southwest from the Russia-Belarus border region into northern Ukraine on the morning of Feb. 24, a single Ukrainian tank brigade stood between it and the eastern suburbs of Kyiv.

&gt; The 1st Tank Brigade is one of the best of Ukraine&amp;#039;s 20 active brigades.

&gt; What role the 1st Tank Brigade plays in this next phase of the war probably depends on how much time the brigade needs to rest exhausted battalions, repair battered tanks and intake replacement troops and vehicles.

The datapoint is little glitchy, when you scan it with your focus it show the name ""delete"" but when you go in the notebook, it show the name "" permanent orders"" or something like that. My game is in french language so I'm not sure what is it in english. I hope that will help you.

&gt; When a Russian tank army swept southwest from the Russia-Belarus border region into northern Ukraine on the morning of Feb. 24, a single Ukrainian tank brigade stood between it and the eastern suburbs of Kyiv.

&gt; The 1st Tank Brigade is one of the best of Ukraine&amp;#039;s 20 active brigades.

&gt; What role the 1st Tank Brigade plays in this next phase of the war probably depends on how much time the brigade needs to rest exhausted battalions, repair battered tanks and intake replacement troops and vehicles.

FSR has a long way to go. Hopefully 2.0 will do for FSR what 2.0 did for DLSS. I've found it completely underwhelming on the Deck. It just looks like a ton of sharpening thrown on top of a blown up image. The exception is when I'm outputting the 1280x720 resolution to my 1080p TV and using FSR. It looks better there, probably because there are more pixels to work with.",1648771270

L! Robin is a good unit, don't get me wrong, I have it myself with some merges and I like to use it.

Of course, I mention armor units because, since IS implemented save skills, armor units no longer have the mobility problem you mention, in fact, armor units are currently the only units with mobility in the enemy phase, that's why they are so broken. 

The fact that L! Robin is a flying unit, for taking hits in enemy phase, more than an advantage it is a disadvantage in a meta full of top tier bows, specially in earth season, where L! Claude is God and you will find him in 2 out of 3 arenas. In other game modes, apart from Claude, who is also very common, you will find Duo and L! Chrom, Duo Dagr, Harmonic and L! Leif constantly, always with atk/speed stack + NFU builds and/or brave effect bow.

Currently, all of the best tanking role units in the game are armor units, especially the ones that have access to ""nullify effectiveness against armor"".",1648771270

I've since sold most of my bond ETFs, but I'm going to slowly buy back in since the yield curve has officially inverted.

"ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM","t5_3o0h8","One of the demands of neoliberals is that the foreign countries they parasitize *not* use tarrifs and subsidies to grow their home-grown businesses -- because that would make the parasitism impossible.

* Please take a moment to **review the sub rules**. Ignorance is not an excuse for rule breaking.

* Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services if you are under 25 flair, with any fees included in the price.  If you have over 25 flair, all methods of payment are allowed.
* All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 
* Please **DO NOT** remove prices after an item is sold. Prices MUST stay on the post. Please wrap the item in `~~` characters to ~~strike through~~ the text instead.
* Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  
* If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  
* If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear in both value and number. Please consider using r/edcexchange as well.

Just avoid my hometown of Oldham on the way there (it's a shithole). 

Liverpool is also a great city though I'm not supposed to say that.

Also visit North Wales for some lovely castles, coastlines, &amp; mountains. I recommend going up Mt. Snowdon, Zipworld, and Surf Snowdonia. Conway and Caernarfon for castles. 

Betws-y-coed has some lovely hiking trails too.

If you're in that area visit llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch for a photo with the train station sign for obvious reasons.

"FindTheSniper","t5_33x06","Hi, I've placed some grids over your image to help commenters indicate where your sniper is:

- [Big Grid](https://i.imgur.com/wDtVDjg.jpeg)
- [Medium Grid](https://i.imgur.com/phcrppI.jpeg)
- [Small Grid](https://i.imgur.com/RyWjVAX.jpeg)

---

Some suggestions:

- Use the largest grid reasonable to describe your location
- You can provide hints by using the Big Grid with a wide range, something like (1,1) to (4,5).
- If it's in the center of the image, you probably don't need to bother with coordinates, unless someone asks!

The grid uses standard coordinates (x, y) where `x` is the horizontal axis and `y` is the vertical axis.

- I don't know what is his HELOC rates , assuming 3% he is just paying 750k in interest per month only . let's assume he is paying back HELOC in 20 years which brings principle payments to be 1,250$ and combining it with interest of 750$ ( rough calculation) so total -ve is 2k on this property per month



Rental property 2

- 250k down payment mortgage of 700k . The property is cashflow negative by 1k per month

you entered into a contract when you signed up for an ebay account and then made a bid on their site.

whatever you do come up with a solution fast. I'm no lawyer but I would be worried about the seller suing me over storage fees.

as far as getting some sort of refund your going to take a hit. 

 that 300.00 deposit is gone it went  to his ""dealing with stuff that I shouldn't have to"" fee.  you created a pain in the butt for this guy he now has to refund the money relist the item and deal with all the questions that come with the new bids.

*the primordial crucible, where all life was once  blended*  
*together.*

The Greater Will created Order, so it stands to reason the greater will also created chaos or something else did(perhaps the ""Void"" is more then just a description of space). 

I think the mistake that Fia is talking about might have more to do with Marika stealing death from the ""Order""; Since it appears Fia's objective is to make life and death more like the Ancestorial Spirits, where death is an increase in power. I'm not convinced it's the same issue.

It's possible the Fingers issues sprung when either Marika took the death rune out of Order or when she shattered the Order.

As Gideons spell suggests the Lands Between were broken long ago(imo most likely from Marika stealing/removing Destined Death from the Order).

"shacomains","t5_37875","For AP Shaco that‚Äôs not true at all, compared to Heimerdinger and Zyra plants boxes don‚Äôt have a good ap ratio (considering also the range so the expectation hits). Those two other champs have more consistent dmg outputs and mana management over Shaco. Yes you can argue that Shaco boxes are traps, but still if you study the case you‚Äôll notice that boxes are an hybrid of minion-turrets and trap: they take mostly the negatives of those classes, taking really few goods‚Ä¶ 
Example? Dmg traps usually deals all their dmg once they are activated, Shaco‚Äôs ones don‚Äôt. You can argue that Jhin‚Äôs ones also, but Jhin‚Äôs traps have a different role in his kit (are not used to deal dmg). All minion-type of turrets have low cost mana momentum, and you pay for them at the same moment they are activated, Shaco‚Äôs ones don‚Äôt. And so on, you can write so many problems and inconsistency for Shaco‚Äôs boxes, and thats caused mainly because you don‚Äôt want to give to an AD assassin a good control ability‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a design problem, they don‚Äôt have a good design for both the champion natures (they could have it, but they don‚Äôt).
Just saying Heimer spends 20 mana for a time immortal turret that can last forever (so infinite dmg for 20 mana) without committing so much his mana, and his mana momentum is really low (he regains more mana than he spends for placing turrets). Zyra can place seeds at gratis (no mana commitment at all) and activate them once she needs.",1648771276

My point is that the vaugeness of this term is major problem.

Conservatives have even made this argument in this very thread, that a gay teacher shouldn't be mentioning their spouse in the classroom. 

So by all means, if there is a very clear piece of case law that provides a more limited definition of ""instruction"",  please show it.

"books","t5_2qh4i","I mean... I see where you're coming from.  It's the question.. is Batman or Punisher superhuman?    Or how about Tony Stark?    The answer is simply... I don't know, but I think not.   I think the correct answer is they're ""peak human"" but you absolutely can say they go beyond what a normal human can do... and that's what the BG and mentats are supposed to be at. 

I said in another comment the BG are ""Shaolin monks"" and I think that's a perfect comparison.  Everything they do is born from extensive life long training, and then a few people are supposedly able to have superhuman abilities.  I think that fits the BG.  

But really I don't know, it's Sci fi, I imagine Herbert would agree with me, that BG are ""peak human"" and then gain Super human abilities on top of that, but he might be like ""They always were superhuman.""",1648771277

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","I think you misunderstand. Nuclear does have its risks, as any source, but they can be safely mitigated with redundant equipment. Contrary to pop fiction, nuclear reactors don't just blow up or spontaneously blowup. Chernybol was a very specific disaster that had a lot of very specific things go wrong. The real threat is a 3 mile island or fukishima style meltdown. Nuclear reactors produce byproduct unstable atoms that decay (breakdown radioactivity) over the course hours or days and produce excess hear . When shutdown, by inserting control rods, the fission stops but these unstable decay products are still there and decaying thereby producing heat. This decay heat is removed by circulating water in the reactor. Fukishima occurred because the tsunami knocked out the generators that provided back up power to the pumps that circulate this water. The decay heat, with nowhere to go, boils off the water and eventually melts the fuel itself which causes the actual nuclear release. While no design is 100%, modern designs have redundancy built in to prevent this type of disaster. 

That being said nuclear is one of the safest power sources. Compared to coal ash, nuclear waste is actually easier and safer to deal with. But, as another user pointed out, nuclear is very expensive and takes a long time to build.",1648771277

Porn is not going away. No matter what parents do, kids are going to be seeing some gaping sphincter with a bottle up it. All a parent can do, is explain it isn't real.

As for yourself, you know it isn't real. Once you've seen couple dozen you've seen them all. If you make an effort, there are a handful of porn movies out there with a story. The best wank though, is the story you make up in your head. ;-)",1648771277

For example, a non-citizen without any kind of legal status may be removed for a conviction of any criminal offense, even if it is not particularly serious.

But of course so other things come into play as well.  I have been doing this for decades, taught hundreds of people how to do it. To figure out the exact right spot in a crowded anchorage, the best tool by far is a good radar.  It gives you precise distances to all the other boats around and helps you find the exact right spot.  It is not ESSENTIAL, but it makes it a lot easier.

Using a modern, ""high tech anchor"" that is more than big enough is also key.  We have a Mantus, and if it doesn't grab hard and yank the boat around on the first drop, we know the bottom just isn't suitable.

Iam going to start this off by giving y'all a lil back story so my mom and I have never been really close my grandma raised me my mom was there but she always like to go party are she had a new boyfriend so she never had time for me iam 34 years old and iam from Louisiana I moved to Ohio with my mom almost 3 years ago and that's where I met the love of my life we are engaged and we set our wedding date for June 17 2023 my mom has had a couple different boyfriends since I been up here right now she is dating this older guy from Ohio but they are staying in Louisiana now my mom knows iam about to get married and I was looking forward to planning a wedding with my mom this is my second marriage my first was just a court house marriage I want a real wedding this time well she decides to text me a couple of weeks ago and tell me she is marrying this older guy my mom has been married 3 times already and she hasn't been with him long so if course iam not happy about it not only that she is going to marry him a couple months before I get married so not only am I upset iam really hurt I feel like she always has to try and one up me and it's not a competition I don't have that much family in Ohio and I was really hoping this would bring us together I wanted my mom to finally be there for me my grandma is 90 years old and she is coming from Louisiana to Ohio just to be here for me I mean am I the asshole for being hurt and upset and not talking to my mom are should I just let it go and be thankful for my grandmother


P.s this isn't the first time she did this to be when I married my first husband she had to get married so she got married 3 weeks after me so it's not like this is a coincidence are something and she was the first person I called when we picked a date so she knew it all beforehand

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I disagree fundamentally. Aesthetics are a huge part of roleplaying. Gameplay interactions are only one aspect of it, but there are plenty of games that allow for that as well. If we're only talking about hard mechanics, then fine, video games tend to have a few paths that you can use to solve a situation: stealth, full on assault, talking your way out of it, etc., but it's the story about your character's personality and drives that you build around those limited options that allow for roleplay. 

The more gameplay reactivity the better, and some games do it better than others for sure.  But to say that's all there is to creating satisfying roleplaying experiences... well there's a whole community of CRPG fans that might beg to differ. 

Even in a game of DnD you're still just creating window dressing (setting, and characters) around some limited gameplay mechanics. It's definitely a more open platform, but those aesthetic choices are just as important as they are in video game role playing, and it's not just about mechanics.",1648771279

Yes, but I think he also firmly plants himself on Honami, affecting every decision she makes going forward. She may not be as trusting of him because of his relationship, but she will probably grow comfortable around him, as they've always had really good chemistry. In Y1V10, Honami claimed that nobody is more deserving of her praise vote. That was also before he realized that he was in danger of being expelled. Honami has always held Ayanokouji on the highest standard, so it's clear it'll continue if he goes to her class. He will take advantage of her influence.  


I think Himeno will become the new Karuizawa, in the sense of being his undercover spy, taking orders from him and doing things behind the scenes, whereas Honami will be his Hirata. Unless he takes a more active leading stance in Y3. I don't really see it happening, but it just depends on how serious he is with battling Horikita.",1648771279

I've got 3 kids of my own. So I'm pointing out to you as a mom that your mother's behavior was not acceptable because she is treating you as a minion in this, someone who has to do what she says for no pay (and that's also called a slave, really), and not the way she should treat you as someone she cares about.

Stuff happens. It can be really hard to find childcare. I'm guessing though that if she had approached it from a position of 'I'm in a jam, I realize you don't want to do this but I cannot yet find a suitable alternative, is there a way we can make this work' you'd have been a bit more willing - instead of what she did do, which was more or less 'lol deal with it'.

The pandemic ended that career, and my desire to pursue it, but it was optimal for ADHD in a lot of ways. When I was passionate about it, I was willing to work in a lower paying arts sector because the nature of the job meant I had a lot of freedom to pursue a lot of different facets of work.

"bapcsalescanada","t5_2tesr","I dont think anyone looking at 3080s and lower are going to be able to even get a 40 series card. Too many things to upgrade along with it to make it work unless you're an enthusiast and; no telling when they're actually available or viable. But it is a good thought to have buying any piece of pc hardware.

By your definition a 1060 6gb is end of life and irrelevant, even though it's still the most used piece of gpu hardware in North America. 40 series cards drawing 650w for the base models, makes me wonder how many people are going to spring at a $2000+ card, as well as psu etc. Not for me.",1648771281

Drama and intensity sells. However, before NASCAR reads this and tries to make more drama, manufactured drama is bad and people can see right through it.

"Ghosts","t5_2r1q4","I live in my passed-grandparents‚Äô old house, who I was extremely close to growing up, surrounded by their stuff and even sleep right next to where my grandfather passed away. There‚Äôs so many details about this house I‚Äôd love to share, but I feel like it‚Äôd bog down my comment and feel made up (like the fact that most of their daughter‚Äôs possessions, who passed away over 50 years ago, is in a trunk at the foot of my bed).

However, there‚Äôs been weird stuff happen over here, even before my blood-grandma, who was extremely close to these grandparents, passed away‚Äîshe lived in this same house for 5 years before I moved in. She‚Äôs been woken up in the night, seen things, the oven‚Äôs light turned on and off at weird hours after they had passed away (especially since she‚Äôs had electrician after electrician out, but none could find anything off), and she said she can feel them and, sometimes, felt like she could nearly talk to them.

Fast forward to when I move in here, and I can feel them here. I love them so much, and I know they love me, so it‚Äôs not a dark or evil presence‚Äîjust a mournful one sometimes (like seeing a relative In the hospital). My grandparents aren‚Äôt actually related to me by blood, but they‚Äôre really my godparents who all but adopted my mom. When I tell her some of the weird things that happens (bumps in random rooms, stuff falling on the floor when no one was in the room, hearing their voices), she says that *thats* what grandma would hear too.

When my grandma passed away in December, I was completely devastated‚Äîshe was (quite literally) like a second mom to me. However, about a month after she passed away, there was new phenomenon happening in this house.

She loved to cook especially early in the mornings, so there‚Äôs been 3-4 times where I‚Äôve been in the kitchen, go into the other room for something, and a utensil falls down on the ground (which are kept in a big ceramic holder 1-1 1/2 feet away from the edge on an island), the last two times it‚Äôs been a wooden spoon and tongs. Some books have fallen off the table as well. 

The spookiest and most unexplained one yet‚ÄîI had made some coffee using a pour over and began to work on some homework. About an hour later, my pour over thing was shattered on the ground about 2 feet away from the counter. To give some context, I usually have it sitting on a heavy mug a foot away from the counter drop off (I have a few cats, and I‚Äôm so afraid they‚Äôd try to push it off). Two cats were sleeping next to me and on the couch, and were scared as hell when it shattered (they had poofy tails and all), and when I checked on the third, she was sleeping on my bed. I wish I‚Äôd have taken a picture of it‚Ä¶.

All of this is to say that I haven‚Äôt tried going out of my way to find evidence of the afterlife‚Äîthere‚Äôs been so many weird things happen to me, alone, living in this house that I can *feel* like they‚Äôre still here with me. However, I haven‚Äôt tried to prove anything (especially since they‚Äôre not hurting me‚Äîin fact, I think Grandma is still trying to cook and clean).

TL;DR: I live in a haunted house surrounded by ghosts of people who love me, and who I loved and adored growing up",1648771281

He's neurodivergent, so will not do even the normal work. But schools are built around bringing kids up to level if they are in special education, not around delivering instruction differently for smart, yet neurodivergent, kids.

&gt; Even before Russia&amp;#039;s unprovoked onslaught, the signs were not good for the 1,234-kilometer offshore pipeline - designed to double the flow of gas between Russia and Germany.

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine has killed off the Nord Stream 2 project. In short, it would be unthinkable for Germany or any other European country to do a U-turn and authorize the pipeline after Russia&amp;#039;s behavior,&amp;quot; Kristine Berzina, senior fellow and head of the geopolitics team at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNBC Wednesday.

&gt; &amp;quot;Europe&amp;#039;s attitude to Russian gas has changed irreversibly, and it is now determined to diversify away from Russian gas. Meanwhile, Russia is threatening to halt gas flows to Europe if payments are not made in rubles. It&amp;#039;s hard to see a rapprochement between Europe and Russia that could facilitate a green light to Nord Stream 2, even years from now.""

"inscryption","t5_2zhqxe","Mkay, few issues, but not many (and I'll ping OP because yeah) u/Maka-Johnson.

Here are my corrections and the info I've gathered from everything in Inscryption (The Hex may add more info but this is all I know). I have a mix of facts and some theories not yet confirmed based on those facts:

The Code is the order of the cards found in Hitler's pocket when the Soviets stormed his bunker and gound him dead. This Code can be input to arm/disarm (we don't know which) a doomsday machine underneath Berlin that, if detonated, will completely wipe out a good portion of Eastern Europe.

The machine was (possibly) built with the help of the Devil and that is why there is demonic evil associated.

The Soviets learned this and transfered it into information, this is the seed of the OLD_DATA. Then, Barry Wilkinson learns of this and transfers it onto a floppy disc and smuggles it out of the USSR.

Kaminski's company is in on it, and aids in hiding the disc with the DATA by putting in a shipping container with several other discs to GameFuna.

Kaycee (who I haven't found anything on meeting Luke so idk where you got that info) is one of the devs on making the game, starts work and is given the OLD_DATA floppy.

The game is written on top of the DATA and the DATA itself seems to have grown to any documentation added regarding the actual Code, including the documents on the people involved. This is evident as the game knows how Kaycee dies dispite that not being recorded in the floppy. (This makes me believe the current version now includes Luke's data too, but that's not confirmed).

Kaycee learns of the OLD_DATA and as time goes on when Leshy wins the race we see play out again in Luke's playthrough, and over time decides to bury the game in the woods so it doesn't do anything (but can still be obtained in case we do need the Code to disarm the machine).

Kaycee is then killed in a fire 

Luke then finds it, yadda yadda garage sale, yadda yadda coordinates we all have seen the videos.

...

Luke is then killed by Amanda (we do not know if she is actually under GameFuna or if she is independently doing this)

As far as we know, Amanda is Sado's human form/puppet.

P03, not dying as evident at the end of the ARG attached to the game, finishes uploading what is left of the floppy's content. 

Because the game was ENTIRELY erased, this the OLD_DATA, and it takes the only thing left of the game, Luke's recording, and uses the OLD_DATA the same that enabled the Angler to walk without a walk cycle even being in the game files.

The Game follows the same thing the videos did with some variation enabled by the OLD_DATA based on the player, which is why we start with Leshy and not P03.

This is nor confirmed, but it is my opinion that the OLD_DATA cannot be copied, merely transferred and because of that, the game that went public was completely clean of OLD_DATA and it's just the game that was built by the DATA.

If anyone has anything about The Hex to add that would be appreciated, but that's about everything I've learned from this game alone.",1648771282

"glowforge","t5_39fje","YES! They're so much fun. And just think, if the world survives, people in the future finding these engraved photos and wondering how the hell we did it hahaha....

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for noticing the windshield! 

&amp;#x200B;

At my husband's request, I used the lasso tool in PS and selected just the windshield and side windows, and tossed a gradient in there ... the freaking reflections on the glass were also killing the image! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, when we (hopefully having the settings dialed in perfectly for the blanks we'll be using so we aren't embarrassed) take photos on the spot of people's cars at this car show we're doing on the 9th, I'll  drop them into PS, remove the background, click the nifty photoshop action I'm going to create to B&amp;W/Grayscale + invert the image (+mirror if on back of acrylic vs. front of wood) + do a base level gamma correct/reduce the black output, tweak it a bit if needed, select any windows and gradient, export to PNG, and then live engrave! No pressure. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I was kinda thinking as far as doing separate actions within the same file - I feel like stopping in between and trying to line something up on top of an existing engrave is just asking for disaster (which I found out with waiting to do cut lines later vs. doing it all at once, with cut last. Thank you so much for this info, I feel like you seriously just saved me hours and hours and hours of time and I wish I could repay you somehow! If our new business ever does a monthly newsletter or something, maybe I'll do a ""referral code of the month"" feature for each person who has helped us along the way LOL!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to go look at that post for the photo image now - seriously, thanks again! When the first person who commented was sort of a dick and ultimately not helpful (and erased their dick-ish comments lmao) I was kind of worried that I'd be up shit creek on this!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is what is meant by the velocity of money. Entrepreneurs are the stimulus creating value that's not thin air.  


A lot of the money printed won't be touched. If rich people did spend all of their money it would be massive slippage in regards to purchasing power. Prices would increase much faster than wages. This is unfortunately the second phase of the stimulus. Poor people had to buy things, rich people profited and now are buying all of the houses and things poor people will want after they realize they have undercharged for their labor.  


Personally, I think privacy focused cryptos and separating money and state are the best way forward for most of the world. Not the US though, going to war to protect reserve currency status is MUCH more important. I dare anyone to consult wikipedia on the number of millionaires in the world by country. The US is stupidly rich because its citizens in effect are early BTC holders. Not much solace if you are a negative or no-coiner, but something to think about.",1648771283

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Ikr. It's just under $6k total (for 7 years) using those numbers. Tbh I was expecting it to be a lot more of a savings.

If you ate 2 meals there almost every single day, let's say 350 to account for holidays and vacation, that's 700 meals in a year. $10 per meal would be a fair estimate if you were eating like McDonald's or Subway- which this quality of food is equivalent to anyways. 

So if you were eating those meals at fast food places, paying $10 every time, it's $7k per year. Therefore spending only $150 per year instead adds up to a bit less than $50k in total over 7 years. Which is a substantial amount but would require eating there twice a day nearly every day and OP doesn't do that.

If you only ate there once a day, only doing lunch on weekdays, you'd eat 260 meals in a year. ""Normal"" price = $2600 per year so you're saving not even $2500 a year. Which is a lot if you make below the poverty line but not enough to make it worth it otherwise imo. 

Definitely a good deal if you go a lot during the summer and stay all day but to spend an hour every work day to get fast food at a discount amounting to less than a year of car payments is more trouble than it's worth for anyone making a half-decent salary. 

Personally I'd save maybe $100 a month doing this instead of bringing food from the grocery store which is significantly less terrible for you. It's a trade-off that makes sense for someone struggling hard with money but seems like a waste of time and health for most people.",1648771283
"wargames","t5_2rcjh","I play Warmachine/Hordes.

All stats are open, and if an opponent doesn't know them they can either ask for stat cards or ask for specific stats (what's the def of that model, what's their melee attack, ranged attack).

If I'm playing friendly games I'll warn friends if they do silly stuff (moving that model will trigger a free strike). If not, I won't, and I expect people at tournaments or not learner games to know stats. But if a question is asked I always answer directly and truthfully because stats are always open in that system.

Just because they don't have every model memorized doesn't mean much.",1648771283

Helemaal mee eens hoor. Dat zorgt er ook voor dat er dialogen kunnen ontstaan naar aanleiding van dit soort verklaringen.

&gt;Tuurlijk mag je de andere kant belichten, maar in dit conflict zou dat geen invloed moeten hebben op de politieke overwegingen, net zoals in andere oorlogen.

Naja, de toespraak was aardig in lijn der verwachtingen toch? Meer steun in de vorm van economische oorlogsvoering met Rusland, een heroverweging tot toetreding tot de EU, en het sturen van meer wapens.

Wat ik persoonlijk liever had gezien is het inzetten op een diplomatieke oplossing, waarbij Oekra√Øne zo min mogelijk verliezen op loopt. Het blijven bijdragen aan de duur van deze oorlog, en een potentieel escalerende houding, is niet alleen in het nadeel van de Oekra√Øners, maar als ik de berichten zo zie ook voor onze eigen economie en welzijn.

Als jij het hebt over 'geen invloed moeten hebben op', dan lees ik daarin dat een neutrale blik moet voorkomen dat wij met de beste intenties het ravijn in lopen. En als dat klopt, dan ontmoeten wij elkaar daar wat betreft standpunt in deze casus.",1648771283

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","This is actually pretty common. 

At the one end of the scale people hire sex workers.. not really love but they get sex and some intimacy.

Then you have things like sugar baby / sugar daddy / sugar mommy style arrangements. This has the veneer of being slightly more respectable, as the richer is not just paying for sex but more supporting them generally, and getting more of a normal looking relationship in return. 

Then you have the general practice of rich men going to poor countries to find a wife. This is generally looked down upon by society but it still happens a lot.

Lastly you have even normal marriages in western countries where one party is rich, the other average, and it‚Äôs pretty clear to everyone that if money was not involved the marriage wouldn‚Äôt be happening.

So yeh basically you are not the only one to spend money on love.

That said it‚Äôs not the same as true love and you know that..",1648771283

This does no mean you need to go out and get a 10k mattress. It just means do your research. Find a decent mattress that works for you. It's a game changer. Also softer mattresses are not as good for your back long term.

And then Biden came into office signing 50 something executive orders, most of which making oil Drilling and oil exploration as well as exporting oil off the table. You don't think that the manufacturers of oil are going to change anything because of those policies? But that has nothing to do with the President right??

*****
&gt; Even before Russia&amp;#039;s unprovoked onslaught, the signs were not good for the 1,234-kilometer offshore pipeline - designed to double the flow of gas between Russia and Germany.

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine has killed off the Nord Stream 2 project. In short, it would be unthinkable for Germany or any other European country to do a U-turn and authorize the pipeline after Russia&amp;#039;s behavior,&amp;quot; Kristine Berzina, senior fellow and head of the geopolitics team at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNBC Wednesday.

&gt; &amp;quot;Europe&amp;#039;s attitude to Russian gas has changed irreversibly, and it is now determined to diversify away from Russian gas. Meanwhile, Russia is threatening to halt gas flows to Europe if payments are not made in rubles. It&amp;#039;s hard to see a rapprochement between Europe and Russia that could facilitate a green light to Nord Stream 2, even years from now.""

In the beginning, there was a plan,  
And then came the assumptions,  
And the assumptions were without form,  
And the plan without substance, 

And the darkness was upon the face of the workers,  
And they spoke among themselves saying,  
""It is a crock of shit and it stinks.""  

And the workers went unto their Supervisors and said,  
""It is a pile of dung, and we cannot live with the smell.""  

And the Supervisors went unto their Managers saying,  
""It is a container of excrement, and it is very strong,  
Such that none may abide by it.""  

And the Managers went unto their Directors saying,  
""It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide by its strength.""  

And the Directors spoke among themselves saying to one another,  
""It contains that which aids plants growth, and it is very strong.""  

And the Directors went to the Vice Presidents saying unto them,  
""It promotes growth, and it is very powerful.""  

And the Vice Presidents went to the President, saying unto him,  
""This new plan will actively promote the growth and vigor  
Of the company With very powerful effects.""

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","&gt;Just remember, whenever you see the word LORD in all caps, Gods name was there in the original text. Whether you like Yahweh or Jehovah, one of those should be there. Jehovah being the more widely accepted English translation. 


[Yahweh is not His name](https://av1611.com/kjbp/ridiculous-kjv-bible-corrections/Yahweh-Jehova-YHVH.html). I do believe Jehovah (or ""Yehovah"") is, though. At least, in English.

&gt;Knowing and using Gods name in our worship and in our prayers, really does help us have a relationship with Him and will help us understand that the trinity is a false doctrine.

I deny the Trinity. I still affirm the deity of Jesus while doing so, however.

I believe that God is ONE. The following is a brief and succint explanation of the doctrine of God's ""Oneness"":

The Bible teaches a strict Monotheism ‚Äì that God is numerically one. Father, Son and Holy Spirit are each modes of God that possess equally all the attributes of deity and the characteristics of personality (Deut. 6:4; Isa. 43:10; 48:16; Matt. 28:19; Acts 5:3-4; 2 Cor. 13-14; Heb. 1:8; 1 John 5:7). 

God became flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah of Israel, who was conceived by the Spirit of God and born of the virgin Mary. He is both fully God and fully man, united without division or confusion (Isa. 7:14; 9:6-7; Jer. 23:5-6; Mic. 5:2; John 1:1, 14; 8:58; 10:30-33; Col. 2:9, Heb. 1:3). 

While the deity of the Father and the deity of the Son is the self-same person, the Son is distinct from the Father in His mode of existence.¬†‚ÄúFather‚Äù refers to God‚Äôs divine mode of existence, whereas ‚ÄúSon‚Äù refers to God‚Äôs incarnate mode of existence; ‚ÄúFather‚Äù refers to God as deity alone, whereas ‚ÄúSon‚Äù refers to God as deity and humanity united in one¬†theandric existence. 

When God became man He took up a new way of existing and a new mode of consciousness that was thoroughly human, being conscious of Himself exclusively as man in that mode of existence, all the while continuing to be conscious of Himself as God transcendent to the incarnation in His continued divine mode of existence. The distinction between Father and Son is not an eternal distinction within God‚Äôs essence, but a temporal distinction beginning at the incarnation *because*¬†of God's newly acquired human existence; the distinction is not¬†between Christ's deity and the deity of the Father (Trinitarianism), or¬†between¬†Jesus' divine and human natures (Nestorianism), but between God‚Äôs divine and human modes of existence.",1648771286

Am I going to be receiving death threats from more than one prior partner?

How many of the children pack are going to be screaming YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD to me? Will they even know I am not their real dad? 

A lot of details here, in general, I am going to sprint the opposite direction and not get caught up in that. 

In all seriousness, I think the hard part is, how can the prospective partner (the mom) convince someone that they are worth everything that comes along with the child situation? How can they convince someone fairly quickly none the less because it's hard to volunteer for that situation, I feel most people once they understand the situation are going to be put off (subjective). What does the mom bring to the table that makes signing up for that kind of life appealing? This is what I mean when I say that person would have to be my dream girl. One child can be challenging enough, now we're talking more than three? I don't mean any of this disrespectfully, let's just be realistic here. There's a lot involved, the emotional weight, financial, time, energy, you name it. I wouldn't write the situation off but it would be the shock of my life if I ever volunteer entered a relationship with that going on.

While the Axis powers were in league with agreements and whatnot, they massively underutilized each others as partners in war. 

Italy gave Germany no notification of warning that it was invading Greece and not much else when it tried to take Egypt. We generally see both of those operations as German ones only because the Italians required German military assistance to finish the job. This pulled away hundreds of thousands of soldiers, pilots, drivers and other personnel from the main front of Barbarossa, as well as ships, planes and armored vehicles, not to mention fuel and other resources. Honestly, the Italians would have made better occupying police forces than they did an army. Neither Hitler or Musollini had mutual plans for how to work together to conquer Europe and elsewhere.

Japan is similar, with some cooperative strategic talks but nothing really resulting from then. Both it and Germany were located on nearly opposite sides of the world, yet both clearly tried to anticipate each other's moves as they acted individually against the Allies (though on paper they tried to look like they were friends). For example, Japan gambled that the U.S. was being drawn into the European war and would likely not be willing to respond much if Japan attacked Hawaii. Germany thought that if Hawaii was attacked, the U.S. would likely attack Japan and leave Europe alone even though Germany and America would be at war. Both were wrong in major part because they didn't collaborate on their plans nearly enough. 

Additionally, Germany treated Japan like a crappy ally. When Japan wanted its own version of a Tiger tank, Germany not only charged them for it but made them pay double what it sold them to its minor allies for. 

The Allies did so well in part thanks to multi-national military operations under the command of a single theater commander. The Axis had none of this and struggled to keep up the defensive against the power of Allied organization and coordination.",1648771287

I was a graphic designer for over a decade, all my jobs were exempt from overtime, that's basically the standard for that career, and there were plenty of weeks I worked 60+ hour weeks only to be paid the standard 40 hour week. The problem with crunch or overtime isn't that it happens, it's that the cultural expectation around it has been ""it's your job!"" and just do it while not getting paid for it. We need to change that mentality at its core. It is not okay to expect people to work for free. Your time is worth mine. Their time is worth money. If you feel like you need people to work more, that's fine, just pay them more, and if they choose not to, they don't have to do the work or get the extra money.

EDIT: Also, this is a big reason so many young designers and developers, as examples, flame out early in their careers. There are big companies and agencies who love to pull in young, wide-eyed, naive talent with lures of beer on Fridays or dog-friendly offices or things like that and ""culture"" and then absolutely grind them to a pulp in a couple years.",1648771287

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I agree.  But IMHO many states / legal systems ""fudge the numbers"" by punishing the victim - no victim \[report\] = no crime. 

Additionally, again IMHO, if you check the number of \[female/girl\] victims prosecuted then you might see a correlation with disparate male vs. female dress codes, and rate of prosecutions of rape where the victim  was considered a part to the crime, because they acted in a manner that violates some narrow cultural norms - how she was dressed, was she dancing, did she have anything to drink, did \[he\] pay for anything, etc.

From my perspective, any boy or girl subjected to ""revenge porn"" should be given immediate support, including but not limited to a conference between all parties (if that is possible - without re-victimizing the parties) that is reviewed for effectiveness - has the proposed support system been peer-reviewed?

What happened to these girls was an abomination. But that will never stop a prosecuting attorney.  But smacking a district attorney or 2 with a lawsuit + a bit of media heat might give them pause.",1648771288

"SkincareAddicts","t5_37kq2","Ouch! That must have hurt.
I did something like that when I was little and my mom literally applied triple antibiotic balm to it, and then when there was a hard scab she applied vicks vapor rub until the scab was gone. So that is a practical solution. 

Now, as a skincare specialist, I would like to recommend something else.
Yes, the triple antibiotic will prevent the area from infecting but so is washing it gently with water and soap.

Given that she has light skin tone, then buy:

Aloe vera leaf - soothes skin, reduces irritation, itchiness and rash, and promote healing.

Vitamin E, liquid - keeps in the moisture, helps healing the skin, protect against light and is an antioxidant.

Lavander essential oil (all essential oils prevent virus, bacteria and fungi) - this oil reduce redness, soothe and calm the skin, stimulate healing, and promote even skin tone. 

Zinc, lotion - anti-inflammatory and protect against sunlight.

Peel the Aloe leaf, the outer layer of the leaf does have a peculiar smell. You only keep the clear pulp and gooey. You can cut it in pieces and store it in a glass container, and keep refrigerated; you can freeze it as well.

You may want to do this recipe every 3 to 5 days, depending on how much mixture you make. 
Do not use if prepared longer than 7 days, there is no preservatives so it will go to waste after that time.

Smash or blend a small amount, like an inch big cube or rectangle is enough, add about a penny size of the vitamin E oil and 1 drop of the lavander essential oil.
Essential oils are extremely potent and that is why you don't need more than a drop or two, also why they are a bit expensive. 

Apply the mixture gently over her skin after washing the area from 2 to 3 times a day for about 3 weeks. You can adjust to your discretion.

Once the scab is gone, you can continue to apply the mixture, and, or, apply zinc lotion so it protects the skin while the color is restored. You can add vitamin E to any lotion, including zinc lotion. 

You can apply zinc to any bruise you may have, even on the surrounding areas of the open skin.

Also, given that you may not use the full Aloe vera leaf, you can use it for a face mask, too.

Please, do not use Aloe vera gel from the store, it contains alcohol and other preservatives that can cause skin irritation on open skin (open/cut/scraped/not normal outer layer of the epidermis).

Hope it heals quickly.",1648771290

I feel very lucky, but I am telling you this honestly, the young associate I work for, hates it. She cries every week from student loans and few choices.

I always ask her if anyone told her what it would be like and she always says no. You have to go out and cultivate clients, be outgoing, join organizations, network, etc. She isn't outgoing that way and has no clients yet. Another associate at our firm is also miserable and tells me he ""won't be doing this billable hour thing forever.""

Instead of accusing me of something I never said,  maybe look at what I actually wrote.  Hope you don't make these kind of unfounded accusations with your clients.

If you're going to make a claim it's reasonable to ask you for the evidence to back it up.  I have seen the opposite.  I know many patients who have given up alcohol but continue to smoke marijuana.  There are people on this board who post about continuous alcohol sobriety who continue to smoke marijuana.  I have seen people who cannot touch anything the rest of their lives.  It's not clear cut.  Why is your anecdotal evidence better than mine?

I have been on Adderall for five years under a psychiatrist's care and never used it as a drug of abuse and have not been at all tempted to after stopping alcohol.  Yet Hazeldon won't let you through the door because in their eyes 'a drug is a drug is a drug' while the research shows the prevalence of abuse in my age group under a doctor's care is under 1%.

As we can see, the whole of our society has a pretty clear cultural and legal consensus on this point - sexual activity in a public place is not acceptable unless everyone who can see it, is OK with seeing it. 

Which demonstrates the original commenter you first replied to above isn't simply coming up with their own weird notion of consent, as you suggested. 

Other similar examples are public defecation and urination, extremely loud music or noise, displaying horrific images. 

We frequently use property rights as a reasonable dividing line to determine whether people should reasonably require other consent before they engage in a particular activity or not, but don't be mistaken that this is means property rights are the ultimate determinant. They're often useful and reasonable as a matter of practicality, but there are many issues where property rights aren't a reasonable boundary for requiring consent.",1648771291

*****
&gt; Even before Russia&amp;#039;s unprovoked onslaught, the signs were not good for the 1,234-kilometer offshore pipeline - designed to double the flow of gas between Russia and Germany.

&gt; &amp;quot;Russia&amp;#039;s invasion of Ukraine has killed off the Nord Stream 2 project. In short, it would be unthinkable for Germany or any other European country to do a U-turn and authorize the pipeline after Russia&amp;#039;s behavior,&amp;quot; Kristine Berzina, senior fellow and head of the geopolitics team at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNBC Wednesday.

&gt; &amp;quot;Europe&amp;#039;s attitude to Russian gas has changed irreversibly, and it is now determined to diversify away from Russian gas. Meanwhile, Russia is threatening to halt gas flows to Europe if payments are not made in rubles. It&amp;#039;s hard to see a rapprochement between Europe and Russia that could facilitate a green light to Nord Stream 2, even years from now.""

1. Corruption. 

Canada has seen a steep decline on the corruption index (albeit we are still well above most nations) but one of the main factors to us dropping out of the top 10 was Trudeau‚Äôs involvement in the WE charity and SNC Lavalin scandals. Dictators aren‚Äôt bound by the laws they impose, and clearly Justin feels him and his friends aren‚Äôt either. 

2. Fondness of real dictators. 

‚ÄúOn behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to the family, friends and many, many supporters of Mr. Castro. We join the people of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader‚Äù - Justin Trudeau

4. Calling for a snap election during the pandemic. 

Obviously this was done democratically but the lead up and execution during pandemic times was very strange to say the least. Fair politics but an aggressive power move when the country really didn‚Äôt want it. 

I‚Äôll end this with saying again that he isn‚Äôt an actual dictator. I like to call him a wanna be dictator because he sometimes displays the characteristics of one.

I remember some guy on thunderplace that banded part of his cock without knowing how ischiemia works. Banded as in using stuff to castrate animals by cutting off blood to genitals aka a really really tight clamp. 


He did it because his wife liked when he did a sort of clamp while fucking.


Poor bastard waited 5 hours before his friend could come with the equipment needed to take it off. The banded part was grey &amp; yellow. Next thing you know he goes to the hospital where they told him he have to get amputated COMPLETLY.


Next thing you know his wife left him and that's the last time he posted.


Sorry to tell that gruesome story to y'all but let it serve as a warning for those of you who wants to take things too far.

A guitar has methods (.*GetNote()* of a given guitar string, with an overload value for the fret you're pressing.)

I have to be physically attracted to the person. I‚Äôm not saying they have to be a god, but they need to be attractive -to me-. I have to enjoy looking at them. I have to like their body.

Personality is important as that shows me what kind of person they are and how I‚Äôm going to feel around them. Are they funny and going to make me laugh? Are they depressed and going to make me sad? Do they listen to me and make me feel seen? Are they selfish and make me feel unimportant? Are they polite to my friends/family and make me feel calm? or pick fights with them and make me feel worried?

And money. Money is important. I don‚Äôt need someone that‚Äôs going to pay for my things and lifestyle, but I do need someone that can pay for themselves to be part of it.

They are not qualified to provide any psychiatric help to Daniel, or even further the charade that is his career.

What Daniel needs is a professional that actually understands what he‚Äôs gone through and what‚Äôs happening to him now. He needs someone with training, experience, and a fitting education for anything to actually improve. I don‚Äôt mean to shit on people who are trying to help, but like. If you are taking on a role as a manager you are either 15 or you have way too much time on your hands to throw away in an ultimately misguided endeavor.

NO, you do NOT mix boiling water in the henna. That will basically burn out all the dye off. Mix the henna with lukewarm water and let it sit in a sealed bowl for 8 hours, then apply it on your hair and leave it for at least 2 hours with a plastic cover on your head to keep the henna moist (saran wrap is my go-to but you can also repurpose a plastic grocery bag if you know what you're doing).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I really hope this doesn't get buried, because I'm so so so so very proud of this. 

When I was in my second year of grad school, the first year grad school students decided to do a Secret Santa within their year. They told us all the details and they were super excited. They all bought very thoughtful gifts for each other. They had the rule that they had to put thr gifts in the student mailboxes, **which were accessible by everybody,** by 9:00 p.m. the night before the last day of school.  Then when they all got in in the morning, they would open up their gifts and reveal who was there Santa was, yada yada. 

My best friend and I went to the Dollar tree and bought the most fucked up shit we could find. I bought one girl, who was morally opposed to smoking, an ashtray. We specifically picked gifts that would be as insulting to the recipient as possible. And then I went to school super early the next morning and switched them all out. Then we sat in our office and watched chaos ensue. 

The second year students were in on the joke and we were all laughing our asses off. Our office was in a little hole in the wall so nobody really saw us as they walked past, but finally one girl did. She pieced together what we did and they were so pissed! 

I honestly don't think that I've ever pulled off a better prank in my life.",1648771298

Firstly, this is by report date - so the fact you can no longer get PCR tests doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt some left to report from the last few days. Same for LFDs which are self-reported - people can still report any they have left.

Secondly, NHS pillar 1 testing still exists. Testing is now essentially scaled back to how it was in March 2020. So there will still be cases reported for quite a while yet - although these will likely rise in line with hospitalisations. There is also still testing for the vulnerable.

"Truckers","t5_2t90b","It was a bright and sunny day.  I was traveling West out of New Jersey into Philly on I-76.  Stuck in **brutal** traffic.  The traffic was caused by a construction zone up ahead.  Two left lanes closing, only the slow lane was open.  Traffic approaching the cones was zipper merging rather honorably for a change, mostly a result of the fact that this traffic was backed up for miles.  There weren't any assholes zipping along in the left lanes and cutting in at the last possible moment.  ""How nice,""  I thought.  I was in the slow lane, loaded with a trailer, and I had approached &amp; entered the area of the cones. There were no longer any other vehicles that were trying to merge in front of me.  
Now it was my turn to enter the only open lane.  It would be unreasonable for any other driver to attempt to merge at this point‚Äîthe two left lanes behind me were empty of vehicles for a couple hundred feet.

But not for long.  In my mirror I could see a small white passenger vehicle flying up in the center lane.  Moving so fast, it appeared he was gonna try and cut in ahead of me.  But it was too late for that.  I hit the brakes and uttered some choice words.  The car closed the gap without any sign of slowing down, and so now I thought he was gonna just yeet it straight into the cones to get around me.  Nope.  At the last possible moment, he cuts it hard right and the rear corner of his passenger side bumper clips my driver side nose.  The car got caught in my deerguard and tore his bumper clean off in an explosion of shattered debris.  Luckily the lane ahead of me was clear for a hundred or so feet as I had stopped and traffic continued.  The car spun around 180¬∞ before coming to rest, and we were facing each other.  He basically PIT maneuvered himself on my deerguard.  By now I could make the vehicle out as a Honda Civic.  I threw my hands up in the universal ""what the fuck?!"" gesture.  The driver ignored me, threw the car in reverse, turned around, and sped off (through the construction zone) into the grim bowels of Philadelphia.

I set the brakes and got out to inspect the damage.  Somehow, despite the large amount of debris strewn about the roadway, my Freightliner was entirely unscathed, except for a scratch on the deerguard.  I brushed aside as much of the Honda as I could, picked up the bumper, got it out of the way, and Sent It.",1648771300

Very, very few of us had any idea that taking a flash picture at an aquarium could cause this much damage. Most of us probably assumed it would just ""bother"" the fish. I think this is pretty eye opening. I do try to follow rules in places like this of course. It's just the general infallible attitude of so many commenters that was rubbing me the wrong way.

&gt; Only two mass bleaching events had ever been recorded until 2016.Scientists say urgent action on climate change is needed if the world&amp;#039;s largest reef system is to survive.

&gt; &amp;quot;Weather patterns over the next couple of weeks continue to remain critical in determining the overall extent and severity of coral bleaching across the marine park,&amp;quot; the reef authority said.

"orgonomy","t5_3ftg0","Atomic Excitation of Water and Ice

The only exception I could find by a conventional literature search on the subject of blue glowing water not dismissed as purely ‚Äúlight scattering‚Äù was for another water-fluorescence reaction, notably the Cerenkov radiation. In this case, water is subjected to constant high-level atomic radiation, as in a nuclear reactor core, and thereafter emits light most strongly, though not exclusively in the UV and blue frequencies. The Cerenkov effect is classically described as created by charged particles traveling through a dielectric medium, dependent upon the refractive index of that medium. Water is a substance of relatively high dielectric constant (k=80), as is living tissue, which also produces a weak blue Cerenkov fluorescence under radioactive stimulus. Cerenkov effects are clearly a product of water fluorescence, with emissions in the same sets of frequencies identified above. We may postulate if this is a special case where water receives a structuring charge and excitation at the same time? Radioactive emissions in this case substitutes for the deuterium light of the spectrometer, or for sunlight in the case of exceptional ice packs, glaciers and blue-glowing lakes.

A similar but fleeting spectral fluorescence is seen in ice when exposed to infrequent high-energy atomic particles, as employed for neutrino detectors located several kilometers deep within the Antarctic ice cap, and well below the depth of optical transmission of visible light from the surface. Neutrino-detection also employs large darkened water tanks deep in underground mines or caves, with numerous photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) peering into the darkened water tank, and sensitive within the same near-UV and blue frequencies identified above for our structured-activated or charged-excited water. This is also true of PMTs as used in standard scintillation counters, where they are coupled with NaI(Tl) crystals, or with high-dielectric plastic scintillators, or as used for biophoton research. Gamma-ray astronomy often employs PMT detectors looking into dark night skies for flashes of light, as given off by excited nitrogen, which also emits in the near-UV and blue frequencies. Complicating factors in such night surveys are generalized air-glow, or the black aurora, which also yield similar UV-blue emissions. UV/bluish emissions are quite widespread in nature, and in the laboratory, even while different explanations are often given for each expression. Is there a common factor at work?

If the member of the species that is best suited to its environment is an example of the pinnacle of that species, then which is the superior man, the tall, slender Australian Aborigine, or the short, squat Arctic Inuit?  Or are these two men from different species, since the Aborigine would suffer in the Arctic, and the Inuit would swelter in Australia?  
  
Let's look for the perfect example of the human race, the best human possible.  What would their skin color be?  Their height?  Their weight?  More fast twitch muscles, or slow twitch?  Or do we have to start subdividing the species?  And then, if we subdivide and say that okay, Inuits and Aborigines are wholly different species, then which is the better man, the Inuit who ice fishes, or the one who works in an office building?  
  
Or perhaps these divisions are much more arbitrary and man made than you're giving them credit for.

&gt;&gt;Which dog is more ideal, the collie or the rottweiler? Collies are very smart, but rottweilers are very strong, which fulfills its prescribed role better?

&gt;the answer is, of course, that collies and rottweilers are different and a collie ought to be good at being a collie, a rottweiler good at being a rottweiler  
  
And could there be a rottweiler who's better at hunting than another?  Could that other rottweiler be a better companion for its owner than the hunter is?  Now we have to start asking ""What is the dog's purpose, that will define their utility,"" but I don't really think things *have* a purpose, not in nature, I think that things are assigned purposes by those who find utility in them.  
  
Pluto used to be a planet, but then we redefined what it means to *be* a planet, so what is Pluto?  The body didn't change, it's the same mass and volume as it ever was, it's *characteristics* didn't change, instead *our definition of what it means to be a planet changed.*  So let's reframe this question: Two decades ago Pluto was a ""good planet,"" today it's not, Pluto hasn't changed in the past twenty years, so why isn't it a planet anymore?  If Pluto has an innate planet-ness, where did it go?  
  
""Rabbit"" is a man made definition, just like ""planet"" is, and the definition of ""rabbit"" is subject to change at any time, just like the definition of ""planet"" is.  There is no universal definition of a rabbit, we can't even use genetics since every member of a species is unique, and we have no control to compare anything against; furthermore, every generation of rabbits is different from its parents, each new rabbit, born with unique genetics and unique mutations, is an evolution over what came before it.  
  
Our definition of a species is an artificial definition, just like the definition of planets, wine, Tuesday, masculine and feminine, and every other word or concept that you know.  You're trying to put things in boxes, but there are no boxes to put them in, at least not in nature, anyway.",1648771302

"AskElectricians","t5_2xtq0","&gt; Those without knowledge

Say shit like: 

&gt; An electrician is only taught resistance. So he wildly speculates about heat.

You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. You are neither an electrician nor an EE - we have proven that in numerous other subreddits. Your ""professional sources"" are nothing more than truncated quotes from publications that you don't fully understand, and advertisements from an energy company that's trying to sell you a surge protector. Remember me telling you that 4 years ago? Your Duke Energy link is to a site that is *trying to sell their own customers an overpriced surge protector*.

Yet, every time you go on one of these rants, you devolve into sentence fragments and insults, while condescendingly telling the person to whom you're responding that all the other people are insulting *you*, and that you know more than everyone else in the forum.

&gt; A self-proclaimed EE has no EE training.

That's you. And if you want ""facts and numbers"", read these ACTUAL SOURCES of ""dumb, uneducated electrician"" course material from first and second year (of 4 years):

Not only is impedance significant in the courses, reactance and simple resistance are thoroughly studied.

It isn't the necessarily the employees job to maintain their mental health while working as it's almost completely dependent on the companies work environment and 'requirements'.

If you are disabled or too elderly, you can give ""Power of Attorney"" to an Executor or Proxy (as another mentioned). This person can be paid or can be family/friend and not paid.

I think ""concierge"" or ""commissionaire"" would be appropriate translations of the Spanish and Taiwanese meanings; however, since this job is not common in Canada/USA, people would only associate those two jobs with hotel staff (though, travel credit cards like Amex offer ""personal concierge services"" and can do many of the things you mentioned.).",1648771302

Except‚Ä¶ The hierarchy never stops excluding others. But as long as you can cling to your rung, many conservatives who buy into this framework will think ‚Äòat least I‚Äôm better off than that those damn‚Ä¶ X.‚Äô

"Autoflowers","t5_2zy2h","Ok man a few things.
1. Boiled water increases the ppm of the water. Unless you are boiling the water and siphoning off the distillate, you are giving your plants a higher concentration of whatever solutes were in it. 
(Think of it like this, you have 5 grams of salt in 10L water. You boil that water down to 5L. Now you have 5 grams of salt in 5ml of water. That‚Äôs a 50% increase in solutes relative to volume.)

2. Chlorine is a very reactive element. Simply leave the water container open for a day or two and the chlorine will evaporate. 

Your plant looks pretty damaged. I‚Äôd first make sure pH isn‚Äôt terribly off and that she hasn‚Äôt been over watered. If she hasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd probably give her a watering with RO or distilled water. If none of that fixes it then she may need specific nutrients according to whatever lockouts or deficiencies you‚Äôve probably created with high ppm boiled water.",1648771303

"pregnant","t5_2qwzb","It's not just videos for entertainment that we are targeted with it's also ads in video form. Facebook inserted into my Feed a disturbing video ad very early in my pregnancy (about September 2021) It was for some kind of seatbelt device intended to prevent injury to an unborn child. It had a very inaccurate computer animation of what happens to a woman's pregnant abdomen and an unborn baby in a car accident. The baby wasn't even positioned correctly! The baby should have been upside down in utero. Aside from the computer animation, between 'information' the ad would depict an unsettling although not visually graphic image of an accident scene of a patient laid out on the road being stabilised. The image would flash red and blue to suggest the presence of an ambulance using emergency signals. The ad was clearly intended to scare mothers to be.

I didn't watch the entire ad as it angered me so much. I wrote a bitter comment, blocked the page for the product and reported the ad to Facebook. Fortunately Facebook has never showed me an ad like that since.",1648771303

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","Sounds like my nephew. I would babysit him and we‚Äôd ride transit (mostly buses) for HOURS. It was his favourite thing to do. He‚Äôd quietly sing ‚Äúwheels on the bus‚Äù to himself while we were riding the bus; it was so funny. Even at two years old, 3 hours solid on the bus wasn‚Äôt long enough for him and he‚Äôd cry when it was time to get off. 

Once a bus driver at the UBC bus loop gave him a hot wheels car and he was over the moon, it might as well have been made from solid gold. 

He moved away from Vancouver when he was 4 (almost 5 years ago) but when he was visiting one year I managed to get him some of those paper buses and skytrain cars from car free day. They have a sacred space on his toy shelf and he‚Äôs had them for years and managed to keep them in good shape. I was always losing things as a kid, but his mom told me he still has his orange compass wrist band that I got him last time he was here, three years ago. :)

"overlord","t5_2tvlr","**Time Stop**

Time Stop would sort of be useful, but I think the applications are limited. Although, you could be the worlds best magician.
&amp;nbsp;

**Gate**

Gate is probably the most useful. Being able to teleport around and even bring people with you would be amazing. 
&amp;nbsp;

I suppose you could steal or do drug trafficing, but if you wanted to be legit, you could create a same-day delivery service no matter the distance. Medical supplies, high-end products, and stuff like that would bring in a lot of money. 
&amp;nbsp;

**Control Amnesia**

This would be diabolically useful. While I think it has some limited uses, they could set you up for life.
&amp;nbsp;

**Control Weather**

I don't really think this is all that useful these days. 
Maybe if you are a farmer or something, but in the modern era there are ways of dealing with these problems. It it the other spells would be more beneficial.
&amp;nbsp;

**Perfect Unknowable**

I don't think this would be that useful unless you are upto something sketchy.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","Capitalism is the ability to open a business and then as the original investor and owner, decide what happens to the productivity surplus that is produced. That‚Äôs really what it is at it‚Äôs core. 
 
Maybe ideologically, socialism is not against ‚Äúmarkets‚Äù in that a buyer and a seller can have a consensual exchange without state interference. But socialists, generally are for ‚Äúplanned‚Äù economics and interfering in this exchange is kinda necessary for all socialist economies.   

By sticking its hands into the way businesses operate. Market economies also requires ‚Äúsuppliers‚Äù to be autonomous in its production and investment which affects the price signals in market economies. 

Essentially what I am saying, is yes, you can say socialists are generally against market economics because it calls for involvement in at a minimum, the production process; which is passed on by affecting the price signals between buyers and sellers. 

The supply curve shifts or changes due to ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù interference. When this occurs systemically throughout the economy, we no longer would call it a ‚Äúmarket economy.‚Äù 

Your argument is essentially not all socialists are for stopping people from buying stuff and someone from making stuff. But by simply interfering in one area, you are hindering the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù to operate freely. You are ‚Äúplanning‚Äù what occurs with the surplus produced by the business. 

This being said, it may be a fine line between planned, market and free market economies. 

Is North Korea a planned economy? 
Denmark a market economy? 
And Switzerland a free market economy?

"Watchexchange","t5_2sqne","I am selling my 2015 Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore Chronograph 26400SO in EXCELLENT condition with Box and Papers. This watch is a beast at 44mm and yet it sits on the wrist so comfortably. The light silver dial with black sub dials gives it that Panda look but with the added AP m√©ga tapisserie pattern dial it really pops. Personally, being 44mm makes using all of the functions much easier to read than the smaller 42mm watches with the same functionality.

"DebateEvolution","t5_2ymjs","&gt;The number of mutations needed in order to change a random sequence into a functional promoter is not clear

Because it isn't clear. 

Individual nucleotides can contribute differently, based on where they are, and what they are. A single G in one spot might make something a strong promoter instantly, while an A in another spot might ""enhance its promoter-ness slightly"".

Biology is *fuzzy as balls*, and works on a very large sliding scale. Even within canonical promoter sequences there are strong and weak promoters: strong promoters work most of the time, and generate substantial mRNA output, while weak promoters sometimes fail to recruit the necessary machinery and output only low levels of mRNA. Within this you can also have stochastic behaviour, whereby a promoter might do essentially fuck-all most of the time, and then suddenly, briefly, output a fuckton of mRNA. Other promoters might instead output modest amounts of mRNA, but consistently. Or anywhere in-between.

Which of these promoters has 'more' information than the others? Do any of them? How do you quantify this information? How do you incorporate the fact that promoter activity is basically a function of sequence-guided probability rather than a fixed boolean property? Almost ANY sequence can be a promoter, and as evidenced by the many, many snippets of sequence found in exome studies, pretty much every sequence *IS* a promoter: it's just that most sequence makes for a very, very shit promoter. Provided most things work mostly correctly most of the time, all is well. Biology can tolerate a lot of noise.",1648771305

I have great stats, great extracurriculars, and poured my heart into my essays. I‚Äôve done everything I can in HS to prepare for the career I‚Äôve dreamed about since I was a kid, and it all seems like it‚Äôs gotten me nowhere. 

I have 1 acceptance out of 13 schools, plus a few waitlists, and it is so hard to hear the people around me constantly rationalizing the school I was accepted to and telling me I shouldn‚Äôt be disappointed. Of course I‚Äôm disappointed, and it‚Äôs okay to be. I held myself and continue to hold myself to high standards, because that‚Äôs what keeps me motivated and striving for more, but it‚Äôs also what is expected of the town I grew up in. 

My last schools came out last week (rejections and waitlists) and I immediately broke down in disbelief. I cried and cried and cried. I took the weekend to wallow in my disappointment. And now, I‚Äôm doing what I know best - working hard. The transfer option is what is helping me swallow my pill of disappointment, because it is NOT over. 

I‚Äôm turning my unfulfilled expectations into force to continue to push for the schools of my dreams.

This is flagrantly wrong. They weren't cancelled; Robertson was temporarily suspended and there were several more seasons.

This is the opposite of 'being canceled for political reasons;' they were allowed to continue for years despite torpedoing their brand because they could still squeeze some blood from the homophobic stone.

"WhereAreAllTheGoodMen","t5_3jsx9","Not white-knighting at all here, but I feel kinda sorry for her, not because of her plight in finding a partner, but as a human being who has worked her ass off for very little. She spent a hell of a lot of life, work and debt on a Doctor of Pharmacy degree, and it's the world's fastest devaluing degree. I have empathy for anyone who poured in all that work, gray hair, life energy and debt to become a PharmD, as it takes as much educational work as an MD, and even requires a residency as well! But pharmacists are viewed by much of the public as a CVS clerk who hands out pills, and they do a fuck-ton more than that.

Ever look at the rants in the pharmacy sub? I recommend it. It's fascinating. If you read that sub for a week, you'll buy a pizza and take it down to your local pharmacy and thank them from the bottom of your heart. 70 year old Walmart greeters (""Welcome to Walmart!"") are treated better. Most pharmacists aren't allowed chairs to sit in by company policy (""You're here to work, not to sit!""), and get almost no breaks. Many suffer from bladder issues from having to hold their bladder to the next allowed pee break. They not only have to deal with hundreds of complex prescriptions/day, which require extensive research for cross-drug conflicts, and an asinine amount of data entry, but they also have quotas of covid tests, covid shots, flu shots, etc that they have to do each day regardless of workload and regardless of customer demand, which is why your pharmacist always tries to pressure you to get a flu shot when you pick up your prescription. They have to wear white lab coats regardless of how damned hot it is under the bright baking lights, and they are perpetually on some kind of performance improvement plan for not meeting the unobtainable goals of some district executive who has never been a pharmacist and just think their job involves stuffing 30 pills in a bottle and handing it to the patient. It's a fucking brutal job, and there are so many pharmacists having breakdowns, committing suicide, or changing careers.

Things most people don't know: Pharmacists don't just hand out pills. They often have to make pills or solutions from scratch like a chemist, using special equipment and tools and the skilled use of their hands. This is called ""compounding"", and it's hard to do well so as to create the correct drug that won't harm or kill the patient. 

Things 99.9% of people don't know: Pharmacists raise and care for leeches in little leech farms, especially the pharmacists in hospitals. The leeches are used in medical procedures to eat dead flesh around wounds... they do it perfectly and much better than any surgical knife, and they do it without pain and collateral damage to the wound. So add ""leech husbandry"" to the specialized knowledge of pharmacists. What they really are, are mages, wizards, healers, medical-doctors (although not recognized as such), chemists, the list goes on. 

I know I'm way off topic here, but she's a 32 year old Doctor of Pharmacy who is actually employed, so she's been through all the school, the residency, and is practicing, and is probably successful at it since she hasn't been fired. And that makes her a bit of a wizard, and one of the critical life savers out there. 

However, she hasn't spent any time on growing her skill in human interaction. Perhaps that's why she lists ""social awareness"" as one of her interests... because it's something she still needs to learn. I seriously doubt she was riding the CC all this time and now wants to settle down. No ex husband and no kids, so she was probably fulfilling her parents' education and career wishes, and has probably been looking for the guy of her dream for several years now, and is wondering why they're all taken. 

She looks stressed in all of her pictures, like she can't actually enjoy the moment and relax. I think the last picture is supposed to be a smile but it's just not - it's a strained grimace. She's prescriptive about the kind of things she wants from a husband, but not about the kind of person she would love to meet. She just cites employment requirements, and there's not a man around who will be interested in meeting those. With this profile, she's looking at a hundred thousand swiperights from guys who want a ONS with an aging hottie, and don't give a shit about any of the text on her profile, because that's not what they're there for.

I think my reply to her would be ""Nah, I have a paid off graduate degree and a great job in an in-demand field, and church services bore the ever-lovin' crap out of me, and cut into weekend relaxation time, so that's out too. Pro-tip: hair dye will knock out the early graying of your hair, and you'll want to jump on that right away. Maybe get a beauty consultation. Life-advice: time spent working on social interaction with others will really help you write a better bio. Best of luck out there!""",1648771307

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I already know everyone is going to say YTA because not her kids, not her problem, but after seeing so many of these kinds of stories on this subreddit, I do have to ask this, even though I know I'll probably get downvoted. Why is it such a huge issue for family members to step up and do something like this? I know there can be special circumstances, but what else is family there for if not to help each other out? Like if I was ever in a bind, I would fully expect one of my siblings or another close family member to watch my kid because we help each other out and family is supposed to be reliable and supportive. But every time a problem like this comes up in this subreddit, the OP is immediately deemed TA for expecting this same treatment from their family because 'just because your family doesn't mean you're entitled to free childcare,' 'not their kids, not their problem.' Like damn, you can't throw me a helping hand every now and then? üíÄ I can understand if this is a recurring problem and family members begin to get annoyed/taken advantage of, but if this was literally a rare occasion that OP's daughter does for her mother's side, why should OP immediately get dragged for being upset that he doesn't get the same grace? 

OP, maybe there's an underlying issue here that you need to talk to her about that causes her attitude towards you and your kids.",1648771308

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I just wanted to add from a mans perspective who has been both the shit bag loser and a great provider.

Im gunna be 34 in may and roughly 10 years ago I was a meth addict. I had a house and a gf who saw the man I have now become, but at the time I was too busy being a waste of air to even attempt to do anything to better myself unless it involved getting high. Long story short, I went to prison and lost everything. However I was very much like your current bf. I moved in with my gf, had no car, jumped from job to job, basically was a free loading mooch. Prison was my wake up call and after I was released I met an amazing woman who im now married to who luckily for me accepts my past and loves me. But im also working my ass off daily to build us a better life. We are married and have a beautiful daughter together, and a beautiful life as well. My job allows her to stay at home and pursue her own passions and intrests. I say all this to point out that sometimes losing your whole world and having everything flipped upside down is what it takes to find your potential. Sometimes we never find it. It sounds like you already know the answer to your own questions. Leave him. Theres plenty of men out there that have learned from theyre shitty past and are willing to treat a good woman like a queen. You deserve it. Dont let a man going no where hold you back from success and happiness. Best case scenario you leave and you find someone who treats you how you deserve and MAYBE just maybe, your current bf will wake up and get his shit together. Worst case scenario you find happiness and he doesn't change at all. Either way atleast youll find some happiness in a partner who actually makes an attempt",1648771308

"britishcolumbia","t5_2qnc6","Why are Governments all shite in power?  

That is a very complicated issue.  In brief, it is a very complicated thing to run a government.  There are many moving parts and personal opinions and agendas in place.

 Add to that, there is always many people who have nothing but the worst intentions for that government, and that does not matter which political stripe the government maybe.  Left, right or somewhere in between will always be targets.

In the current climate, we also do not have the best people willing to put themselves on the line, so we end up with mid level or low level people running the government.  In addition, we also have gotten away from the situation where a government should be made of up many people that want the best to work for the constituents.  Instead, they are working, first for themselves, second for the party and the contributors, and lastly for the constituents, if they ever truly come into the picture.  

I wish I could suggest a true, and valid way to fix it.",1648771308

I had a really hot girl at the beach about 12 years ago ask me what the best pickup line I knew was, and according to my parents she wouldn't stop talking about me when she saw me in the water. When she made a move I dropped the ball completely. Then that doesn't even count the other times for women to make their interest known (very subtlety I may add) to me and for me to not really get it because of my harder time reading people. As a result I've never had a relationship. I'm attractive but I just have really bad luck with women along with the lack of opportunities to meet new chicks in my adulthood. It doesn't always have to do with looks, contrary to what more hopeless echo chambers make it out to be. 

But in short, yes. Women most definitely should make their intentions well known. I've missed out on several relationships since A. Men aren't really taught proper etiquette around women and then wonder why many men are socially awkward around women. And B). Many women can't relate to being on the autism spectrum and as a result I've had some awkward encounters where I probably turned her off by exhibiting quirky or awkward behavior even though before she was showing interest, often leading to guys like me dropping the ball.

I (29M) have a gf (31F) let‚Äôs call her Kelly. Kelly and I get on well for the most part but occasionally she can be a tad self righteous, which comes into play in this post.

We live in Ireland, and there‚Äôs this concert coming up that we‚Äôve been planning to go to for months. Her brother got sick recently though, so she‚Äôs been visiting him fairly often. But these two events seem to be colliding because she said she‚Äôs planning to skip out on the concert to hang out with her brother. I told her this is a preposterous suggestion because I already paid for both of the tickets and she said she‚Äôd go and now she‚Äôs backing out, she told me I should just take a friend so it wouldn‚Äôt go to waste. I told her she‚Äôs visited him several times and will still be able to visit him more, but she said I was being an inconsiderate jerk for not realizing this is ‚Äúmore important‚Äù (here‚Äôs where the self righteousness comes into play). I tell her whatever and she needs to get over herself, and tell one of my buddies to come with me. We haven‚Äôt talked in a few days.

AITA for getting mad? Or is she for having a disregard for our plans?

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;As I said, most of the suitable landing sites are in the North. The east is where Taiwan has many of their bunkers, to protect the rather fragile aircraft , SAMs, and radars they have. I'm assuming you read this and misunderstood me thinking I meant that China would try to attack from the other side of island, farthest from them, thats mostly cliffs.

So the point is having these places in the mountain would help the defense in the north? Perhaps the SAMs, and radar when it comes to fighting. 

&gt;Its a statement about Taiwan has created their own local submarine industry after being unable to purchase foreign submarines; these coastal subs don't need long range, just the ability to lurk in the Taiwan strait and menace any flagships, carriers, or landing ships. believe they currently have 4 subs, 2 of which are Tench-class subs from WW2, but as I was saying, they've bene hard at work creating their own local industry to create new subs and weapons and equipment, with results starting to show.

How will that be a threat? Am I understanding you in that these subs will be a major threat or a minor threat while the PLAN is protecting them? What's the kill ratio for a sub in the shallow water of the Taiwan strait? How are these qualitu compared to the Chinese subs, who have more than a dozen. I think the number is in the 70s.

&gt;The same mentality behind hit-and-run attacks is present in their surface fleet as well, with the Tuo Chiang-class corvettes.

The point about hit and run is that you are running to somewhere. To resupply, rearm, etc. Let's suppose you get some major kills, and you go back to resupply, then you think you can keep doing it with the PLAN on the look out? This assumes the PLAN to be utterly incompetent.

&gt;I like how you make assumptions about what I'm saying

Since I can't read your mind, and I don't claim to, it's kind of hard to go on if I don't make assumption on things you wrote. We are both making assumptions about what each other is saying. I'm not trying to put words in to your mouth, I'm just reading your words and try to understand what you are saying. If I'm wrong, it's because well, I'm not reading your mind.

&gt;every day they spend attacking those islands is another day Taiwan can prepare its own defense; the islands serve as great places to launch missiles at attacking Chinese ships and aircraft.

Well, I'm running under the assumption that you are talking about islands to run operations from. Unless Taiwan has Gundams you will need enough fire power and mobility in terms of ships to make a difference. Like what should I be assuming? Why don't you give some examples? Like how many man you think you are running these raids, or how much artillery, or rockets, do you think you can supply them? 

&gt;The county of Penghu alone covers 90 islands and 54 sq miles. I don't know if you actually understand how much bombardment that'd take to fully cover that large of area and any bunkers underneath, or if you simply like to act like you know a bit about something you don't. 

Let's not pretend either of us has classified info. When you fire from an island it is going to get pick up and someone will be shelling you and bombing you. That's a logical assumption. 

&gt;But Indeed, Penghu's role is to force China to attack them first before the main island, and they're armed to the teeth with missiles. Would China be unable to capture the islands? Honestly, they probably would...after heavy casualties and equipment losses.

Hey if the PLAN and PLAAF is so fucking incompetent at capturing Penghu why are we even talking about anything else?",1648771310

"Hair","t5_2qmsf","Currently my hair is ‚Äúmid-back‚Äù length. I wear it in a bun or pony tail most days because I work with special needs students who pull hair occasionally. I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant and honestly probably due in the next 2-4 weeks, I want to get a hair cut and take some last chance maternity photos this weekend. My sister legit shaved her hair during her pregnancy and kept commenting how great it was not to have to worry about hair while being a first time mom. I don‚Äôt want to commit to anything too short but I wouldn‚Äôt mind going shorter since I really don‚Äôt do much to style my hair as it is. My only problem is when I go past a certain length my hair gets frizzy, I‚Äôve tried changing shampoos, different styling products and techniques but it always stays frizzy. You can even kind of see I have some frizz when it‚Äôs long too, though no where near as much. I was just wondering if there were some good recommendations on cuts that may suit my wavy-frizzy hair type or even some new products for me to track down and try. Give me your honest advice cause I‚Äôm down for anything at this point.

Good places to start are a college's Common Data Set (CDS), which can be found by googling ""X College Common Data Set,"" or at http://commondatasets.com/index.html, as well as the publicly released class profiles , which can be found by googling ""Y college class profile.""

Note that some colleges do not release Common Data Sets (notably UChicago and Johns Hopkins), and that CDS and class profile data can sometimes appear to be in conflict. This is because class profiles often include admitted student data, while CDS data is drawn from enrolled students.

Essentially, my bf is getting back from an international college and couldn't drive the whole time. He gets home in a month but still has obligations in another state for school for 2 more weeks after that. I was gonna come down for 4 days to see him but he wants me to pick him up, drive home so he can get his car, drive back alone, have me come back up in 10 days for an event and drive both our cars back after the event.

I wanted to just drive up for the weekend, drive home, and then drive back in ten days for the event where I'd then take him home. Am I being unfair for not wanting to take him back home so he could get his car? It's expensive and gas is so high rn. I feel like wasting 24 hours driving of the first weekend wastes so much time as well. I get he hasn't been able to drive but is ten more days without a car really that bad?

Make sure you've got strict mode enabled in your `tsconfig.json`.

Most of my practice comes from working on libraries and frameworks where things needed to be as generic as possible. I also just really like TS and JS and enjoy the puzzle of making things generic. It helps a lot to play with features in isolation.

For example, here's a mapped types example that makes all the fields in an object nullable:

    type Nullable&lt;T&gt; = {
        [K in keyof T]: T[K] | null;
    };

    type User = {
        id: number;

    type NullableUser = Nullable&lt;User&gt;;

I have no complains so far and I love the laptop color, feel and everything so far. And maybe some of the newer games mught require medium for stable FPS. I haven't tried super games high end games, so I can't sadly comment on that.

Max I have seen the CPU is at 90 C, but in some  games it only gets to 80 or 70ish, so I would say it's decent. I have it above some books, so no stand or cooler booster for me. I noticed that after two weeks, temps are getting lower for some reason

I haven't tried many high end games yet, but Watch Dogs 2, Guild Wars 2, Fortnite, AC Unity all run like wonders.

It also depends where you live. Here in Venezuela 3060 laptops are very extensive, but in some countries you can find a nice price. Legion 5 is regarded as one of the best lapptops. I have hear some negative stuff about Nitro 5 with 3060, but I am unaware of this.

I think there is also a 3060 version of the MSI Sword. I almost got the MSI  Alpha 15, but I am still very happy with this. Feel free to ask anything. 

I come from an Acer Aspire 3 with Vega 8 iGPU so it feels  super great to me. But it would depend on what you are looking for ^.^",1648771312

They get some sort of accreditation from the Police which is renewed on a regular basis. Normally independent contractors or part of a private company.

They have no guns, but telescoping batons and some limited legal
athority. If they
make an ‚Äúarrest‚Äù, they call in the police for pickup.

Source: My sister was such a steward back in the day, in her free time. Normally at clubs/bars in the weekends. 

This actual footage is from a swedish TV-show called ‚ÄúThe Subway‚Äù, and you get to follow different teams and pair of twos doing patrols and ‚Äúarrests‚Äù.

Big part of their clients are drunks and mentally ill people. A lot of their work and the show is about them de-escalating situations, although obviously not in this footage.

The overarching theme of the game is anger, and there is something to be said about successfully making your player feel rage and frustration alongside the character, but for me, personally, that just sort of soured *a lot* of the gameplay because I found myself still being a little upset even after I put the controller down. Maybe that's more of a ""me"" problem, but I'm not a very easily angered person, especially not toward entertainment, so that was a strange and somewhat unpleasant experience lol

Anyway, I went off on a tangent. I love this sub but sometimes I feel like it's a little unfairly aggressive to players who express any critique or disappointment in TLOUII. Which is... fine, I guess, this is a fansub for the TLOU games, but it is a little disheartening when it feels like if you have any negative or even just disagreeing opinions about xyz, people automatically assume you're a hater or not smart enough to ""get"" the game.",1648771313

I saw you posted the vaccine schedule in another post and honestly, the vaccine schedule seems a little off. Ideally you‚Äôd vaccinate every 2-4 weeks from 8-16 weeks, with at least 3 vaccinations. Waiting 6-7 weeks in between vaccines may not give you the best immune protection. Also, vaccinating at 6 weeks may not necessarily be effective, as maternal antibodies could prevent the puppy from developing an immune response. 

I agree with others, there are other possibilities here. But an initial parvo test is standard for any puppy with bloody diarrhea, vaccinated or not.",1648771313

&gt; For one thing, it contained DNA regions with several repetitions, which made it challenging to string the DNA together in the correct order using previous sequencing methods.

&gt; The researchers relied on two DNA sequencing technologies that emerged over the past decade to bring this project to fruition: the Oxford Nanopore DNA sequencing method, which can sequence up to 1 million DNA letters at once but with some mistakes, and the PacBio HiFi DNA sequencing method, which can read 20,000 letters with 99.9% accuracy.

&gt; Standard human cells contain two sets of DNA, a maternal copy and a paternal copy, but this team used DNA from a group of cells called a complete hydatidiform mole, which contains a duplicate of the paternal set of DNA. A complete hydatidiform mole is a rare complication of a pregnancy caused by the abnormal growth of cells that originate from the placenta.

Zu denken, es kommt keine Werbung mehr nur weil der 24 Stunden Sender Toast ist, der denkt vermutlich auch es w√ºrde keine sch√§bigen Modelle in Videospielen mehr geben, jetzt, wo Spiele mancher Anbieter bereits 80 Euro kosten. Gran Turismo 7 hat es vorgemacht. Denke, die Werbung in Live-Events wird es daher auch weiterhin geben. Wie du schon selbst sagst, sowas nutzt man gerne auch f√ºr Pinkel/Erfrischungspausen, denn oft l√§uft da ja nichts weiter als der Ladebalken der auf k√ºnftiges Programm aufmerksam macht.

So my partner and I are fighting right now. But I guess just for context, I have a tendency to nag, I'm starting to learn and I'm trying my best to catch myself. But, I do a LOT of the cleaning in the apartment and sometimes I'd like his help. 

Anyways, HE told me to give him one reminder to clean the cats litter the next day, I said okay. Its the next day, I gave him his one reminder at lunch time, but then it started getting late, it was about 8-9 pm I was in the washroom trimming my cats claws, it still smelled in there, so I thought he may have forgotten, so I called out to him once I was done with the cat, and he got really mad I gave him one during the afternoon/lunch. It was getting late, I thought he may have forgotten and all I said was ""hey, hon"" then he got really angry. I said I was sorry, and wanted to move on from the situation.
So I figured I'd plan a day to clean in advance as my sister is coming to stay with us in a few days, she happens to be  coming in two days after my birthday, and I also have 3 papers due on my birthday (I'm in uni) so I said if you're not working the day between my birthday and the day she comes in, could we spend that day cleaning? But he was still upset that I ""nagged"" him to clean the litter. When I gave him just ONE extra reminder, he was getting close to my face and telling me how disrespected he felt because I didn't listen to him. I get really anxious when people are upset, and I kind of shut down and don't say anything because I don't want to say anything that'll escalate the situation (childhood stuff). But he kept telling me how he felt I was disrespecting him by not listening to what he had asked me to do, eventually I was fed up, because this wasn't the first time he had done something like this and said if he was so unhappy then maybe we should split up.

 I will be honest, I don't think I was being unreasonable at the start, but I also don't think I should have said what I should have said and I regret it, and I do understand his frustration just a bit. But please I need to know what other people think about this.

"chicagobulls","t5_2s3uz","Chances of winning the lottery are 1 in 292million typically.

There has been at least 1 superstar in every draft class, sometimes more. A 1 in 60 chance.

They are not at all equivalent.

You are correct with many players that amount to nothing, which is why you factor in things like build, wingspan, height, other intangibles, etc‚Ä¶ you look at flashes like the block on Ayton. How many players have the physicality to pull that off? You look at things like team depth, usage rate, etc‚Ä¶ to make a guess based off potential. There is nothing Kawhi did at age 20 that screamed superstar, he was an athletic player, with a crazy wingspan and some solid fundamentals‚Ä¶ same as PWilliams.

What you do not do, is take a 6 game sample size (yes he has played 6 full games this season), and apply it to the future trajectory of a players (likely) 20 year career that will span up to 1,640 games

I am in no way saying that they will be the same player, but for a large group of people on this sub to judge PWill as NOT having even a slither of a chance based off the 6 games played this year‚Ä¶ is laughable.

I‚Äôm very happy that they‚Äôre willing to play some heavy stuff again, because I believe it‚Äôs a huge of part of the band‚Äôs identity. It may not be part of Danny‚Äôs identity, but he must be feeling some weight of responsibility for being the frontman of this band. If he honestly doesn‚Äôt want to be this person anymore, he shouldn‚Äôt be leading the charge imo. I wouldn‚Äôt blame him if he ever made that choice either. It would actually be quite understandable. He may want the band to be something it‚Äôs just not, but I don‚Äôt think Ben or the guys would fault him for it.

And then what? Xadia would still want revenge, the attacks would continue, and continue to endanger his children.   

Getting killed would hopefully sate Xadia's desire for revenge, and his letter would hopefully ensure that Ezran would be smart enough to not continue the cycle and continue giving Xadia reasons to want revenge for stuff.  

That worked out more or less like Harrow planned it did it not?  

&gt;easy way out. but we saw what happened.

Xadia ceased its attacks and Ezran made peace with them? Yeah we did see that.  

&gt;Harrow if he had any sort of braincell left in him would have at least made a proclamation that he was about to die, and that in no way should the populace retaliate against the elves and explain why.

Ezran was his heir, and he did leave instructions for his children to not retaliate.  

The succession didn't go as smoothly as he would've hoped, but that was not because Harrow failed to make it clear what the proper line of succession would be.  

In the end his children did follow his advice and did end up kicking Viren's butt, I don't see how any additional proclamations from Harrow would've changed any of this, it's not like Viren was unaware that he was contradicting Harrow's wishes.",1648771318

Should the husband be entitled to their current living standard forever if they get divorced? Even if he was the one that chose to initiate the divorce?

"yesyesyesno","t5_2z97c","Fairly common cult indoctrination tactic to weed out free thinkers and to solidify the commitment of the others.  Especially useful when you're teaching supposedly ""supernatural"" powers.  If you have a mark who starts to ask too many questions or shows an ounce of skepticism you have them test their abilities.  Since the cult leader/""instructor"" is in total control of the outcome, you make them fail in some spectacular manner.  You then make an example of their failure saying, ""see this is what happens when you don't believe or are committed enough?  You don't want to end up like them do you?""

The target gets discouraged and leaves, which removes a skeptical element, and the folks who witness it tend to double down in their belief/commitment.

Not sure if this is exactly what's happening here, I think the instructor just fucked up and/or started to believe his own bullshit.  Watch the full version of this documentary or any other cult docentaries and you'll see plenty of examples of that type of test.",1648771319

That said i think one of the last quotes sums up the intention of the montage itself: ""We have always created icons in our own image. What we've done is we project ourselves on to him. The fact is, maybe he's not some sort of Devil or Jesus character. Maybe he‚Äôs just a guy trying to do the right thing.""

Mono shurima has 0 interactivity aside from landmark removal since their champions level on play. We would live in a world where you are only allowed to play turbo aggro decks to race the sun disk, or if you play a slower deck it MUST have landmark removal. If mono shurima was OP for the rest of the game I would probably be a PvE only player.

The jock keeps you controlled vertically between your thighs without letting your long/wide bits hang too low and without being too tight anywhere. Different jock strap styles produce different bulge dynamics (wide vs long vs deep) so experiment to desired effect.

The not-too-tight button fly jeans should *hug* your ass and legs but not be very tight on your inner thighs, which will produce maximum crotch space. This natural pocket allows comfortable buttoning of the fly *contouring* over your bulge, producing maximum visual volume and enhanced jean whiskering.

To explain a bit further, a derm can do things like a 'punch' procedure (think really small hole rather than a straight incision) under a local to drain the abscess  and then start you on antibiotics (oral meds or topical) to get the flare down before exploring maintenance meds to keep things quiet.

A surgeon will drain the spot.  Then you'll have to see a derm anyway.  If you are in the US you are stuck with double copays, a longer wait, etc.

If it's bad enough, you can also look into deroofing with a derm.  That's where they take off the top layers of skin to destroy the tracks underneath.  Recovery time is approx 5 weeks.

It's the extremes that matter here, not the averages.

I think the other problem is that a meter only tells you what's happening, not how to improve. There are plenty of traits and skills that *sound* pretty powerful, but see 0 usage in any organized setting, and vice versa.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Ok cool now what do you think about abortion?

I agree with abortion btw... I just think you are going to have to be against it, or really fudge the definition of some of the words 'no' 'one' 'right' 'kill' 'anyone' to make your viewpoint on abortion fit with your viewpoint above. Like what you've said sounds good on paper,but it really isn't realistic. I mean first off, no one has the right to anything really, rights are created/imagined and don't actually exist in the real world in the same way that, say, objects do, so your statement should have a qualifier like 'I think/I believe' or 'some states have decided/some populations have decided/It has been written in to law that/the ideal society would rule that' because without a qualifier you are stating it is some sort of universal fact and I don't think there is any evidence for that. Secondly, what about Euthanasia? Does no one have the right to perform euthanasia for a willing subject? Or have you used the word kill when you mean murder or execute? What about wars, does a Ukrainian soldier have the right to kill a Russian soldier that is shooting at him? If no then please explain why?

The world is complicated, it would be lovely if we could sum up an entire moral code for the entire world in a single sentence of 'no one has the right to kill anyone' ...but the world isn't that simple, that statement is a platitude and it doesn't really mean anything realistically i'm afraid",1648771325

Amazing. If I break a law I don't know exists, I go to jail because ignorance is not an excuse. If a cop conducts a search after stopping me for breaking a law that doesn't actually exist.. that's fine and the search is legal.

I (25f) dated him (26m) for about a year, and while there were a lot of good moments, it was overall not great. He was too immature to be in a relationship, and I let other factors going on in my life push me to be a negative person with bad mental health, which obviously impacted the relationship too. When he first asked me to date, several times, I kept saying I didn't want to because I was afraid we wouldn't be able to be friends if it went wrong, to which he promised many times that we would be friends regardless of what happened. Shocker, he did not want to be friends after. We had already booked an international trip though, so I was like come on lets just do it, you promised we would be friends. Even though I was obviously reeling from the breakup too, I thought it would be a good way to start being friends.

It was not--he ended up going no contact shortly after the trip. Then he reached out to be friends. Then cut me off again. Then finally he started texting me any issue he had while we were dating, to which I would reply and explain/apologize as needed. I never brought up things he had done that hurt me because I had gotten over them because I dealt with them DURING the relationship. He accepted my apologies, and then randomly blocked me again, and then decided to be friends a week later. After being friends for a month, he said he still loved me and I said I loved him too, but...you guessed it...blocked again. At this point I texted something along the lines of ""What is going on. This is so messed up. How can you just treat somebody like this who you said you loved?"" Its one thing to communicate that you are cutting contact, it is another to just block.

He responded and said he needed space for now. I'm leaving in a month, like full on leaving the city, moving out to a city in the midwest (we are from the south-east coast). Because of that timeline I texted a few weeks after he initially said he needed space and asked, in a respectful way, if he had enough space because heads up again I am leaving soon (at this point it was more than a month away). He said no. Then I texted a few days ago simply because, again, I am leaving. He got mad and very rudely told me not yet. I have also been blocked this whole time. We also had a basketball game last week that he bought tickets for us to, but I got the hint I was not invited any more. 

To clarify I do NOT believe I am entitled to anybody's friendship, but I am very confused because he keeps saying not yet, so it is giving me anxiety because I am leaving soon and can't reach out, but he is saying eventually. Neither of us were great in the relationship, and if I am being honest and self-aware I would say I was worse, but this just feels like a mind game. He even admitted to a mutual friend that he was timing his texts to me when he knew I had important events to ruin my night. Based on his reaction to me asking if he had enough space, AITA? WIBTA if I tried to text one more time when I leave?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Younger generations. 

I use to love online games, games that require teamwork and tactics. When I played them, there were some things that MOST people understood and played with: 

They are games, they are for fun, play the most fun way you feel. And when there is a match, try to win whatever the cost, especially if you are behind, because the best memories are battles that you won despite the odds.

Now however younger generations are absolute opposite. They do not play the game for most fun, they play it like a big piss race, pick the most efficient way, no matter it is the most boring way and focus only at rankings, piss race. And of there is a match, and it will take you longer to win, just surrender and lose the match and start a new game. Never take on challenges, pick the easiest route, and surrender at first sign of struggle.

When I log in to such games and get matched with random people, it just makes me go so crazy that I literally stopped playing such games.",1648771327

"mildlyinfuriating","t5_2ubgg","It‚Äôs honestly sad to see people who have swallowed the propaganda so willingly. Americans have been trained to eat shit and say thank you. The fact that you trust massive corporations to be honest only goes to shine a lovely haze of ignorance on you. 

Yes, supply and demand are factors, but do you honestly think that‚Äôs the only thing at play here? 

Companies are recording record breaking profits, while simultaneously claiming the cost of goods and labor has forced them to raise prices. Are you really foolish enough to think that corporations care about more than their shareholders? These conglomerates and their GOP lackeys don‚Äôt give a fuck about you, the working class, farmers, the American dream. You and I are nothing but consumers to them‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it. 

Joe Biden is old, boarding on senile; he‚Äôs worn out his welcome in politics, but his policies aren‚Äôt the enemy here. He approved more oil leases/permit than trump in his first year. The keystone pipeline was a Canadian pipeline. His policies have so little to do with the state of the economy right now.

"Neace","t5_56i30s","**Name**: Roaming Chicken (Mid)  
  
**Runes**: Comet, Manaflow, Transcendence, Gathering storm; Presence of Mind, Coup de Grace (or cutdown, depending on enemy comp) (suggest ability haste/adaptive)

**Items**: Liandries, Mobi boots, Archangel's staff, Damage as you see fit.

**Strategy**:



1. This is going to be played like Lux waveclear. Except Anivia is faster at waveclear once she has Ult.
2. General strat: You shove all available waves on the map, and scale. Anivia scales well.
3. Shove waves with ult, roam with mobi boots.
4. Why mobi? Because you don't need sorc shoes (your damage is huge already), and you should never be touched. You want to be at side lanes for ganks/wave shoving.
5. Between your wall and Q, with proper vision/positioning, you can avoid being hit, which makes mobi's work.
6. With POM/Manaflow, should be mostly fine on mana, even if you repeatedly use it to shove waves.
7. Once you get fed on CS, Anivia Q/E/Ult can take down most squishies.
8. Anivia with mana is awesome at objective denial.",1648771328

Id say that if you like them then you should make time to go and hangout with them regardless of schedules, most guys who are fairly introverted arent going to throw there feelings out there for the hope you have them back... so you gotta show you are interested, more than eye contact and smiles because theres a very high chance he could be mis-reading your signals.. so go and converse with them, get to know them because its the only real way to know if they like you back or not.. and reality is you dont have anything to lose, just more to gain, and with them being fairly introvert as you said, he wont go out of his way to embarrass you as he will probs feel both nervous and embarrassed as you.. so take the time to get to know them, and if you are confident its something then go for it",1648771328

"shrooms","t5_2qszq","Since no one else has said it, I will, ditch the gloves! 

It looks like you're working in a SAB in which case the goal is still air, not negative air pressure. 

The key difference is airflow. 

The fancy glove boxes you see in manufacturing labs are creating a contaminate free environment using negative air pressure. Essentially a constant laminar flow is blowing contaminants out and away from your working space. 

A still air box creates a low contaminate working space by minimizing circular air eddies. Unlike a flow hood, you're relying on minimal air current to create a clean working space.

Simply attaching gloves to a box with no directive air pressure will introduce more air circulation to your box and in turn contaminates. Not to mention, they are cumbersome to use and not easy to clean. 

For what it's worth, I unwrap and wipe all of my dishes outside of the SAB. I'll then place them inside the SAB on an elevated rack and work from there.

I appreciate the overkill, but I found the hobby became more fun when I stopped spinning over contaminates and started seeing what I could get away with ;)",1648771329

"shorthand","t5_2u0w5","I've been using both the 1910 version as well as his syllabic book at the same time.  There are some differences - the first one I've noticed is that he adds an 'SL' blend stroke in the syllabic book that isn't in his earlier shorthand manuals.  I think one thing right off the bat though that makes his shorthand more lineal is that it's based on Pre-Anni, and if you look at writing materials in that version, the outlines are the most compact of any of the further versions of Gregg.  That's achieved by it having quite a few more briefs than the other later versions, and you'll also see that amazing TR principle for prefixes from T-Script in Pre-Anni, which of course achieves even more compact outlines.  Then on top of that, Mosher's additional blends and hooks create yet even briefer outlines, and his shorthand doesn't lack at all for briefs.  He has a large section in the back of his books with a long briefs list that he recommends for further memorization - I counted around 350, and that doesn't include the briefs taught earlier in the lessons.  Of course these briefs are completely optional, but I will learn the more common terms on the list.  He also provides quite a lot of training in phrasing for business purposes in the earliest book from 1903 in a large section after the lessons, which I will probably not be learning.  I'm happy to take on all the briefs, but my purposes for a shorthand is for personal notetaking that I want to be able to read back years later, and extensive phrasing would kill any ability to read back later with any fluency.    


Overall I'm very excited to be learning Mosher, and I love that I'll be learning some Pre-Anni as well since Mosher uses quite a lot of it in his method.  It was the version I was most attracted to when I was looking at learning Gregg some months ago, and looking through the manual is helping me to understand some of the things Mosher does without much explanation.  I have to say, despite how Mosher has more blends and so on, his system seems fairly simple and straightforward compared to Pre-Anni and many of the later Gregg versions.  But the Gregg material is still very valuable because there's a lot of material for study and for later reading practice in Pre-Anni, and so it will provide me some great stuff to work with for ongoing study that I can use with some modification √† la Mosher.",1648771330

&gt; THURSDAY, 31 MARCH 2022, 16:31 - DANA HORDIYCHUK. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree on the payment for gas by EU countries in rubles, but nothing is likely to change for the EU;. He said this during a press briefing on Thursday, Kremlin media reported.

&gt; Putin&amp;#039;s decree concerning payment for gas in rubles applies only to Gazprom&amp;#039;s supply through pipelines.

&gt; As Putin himself said yesterday, nothing will change for companies in the EU and they will be able to continue paying in euros, while the bank will then convert the currency into rubles.

Edit: more stuff!
I have some statistics that I think you should know about with the research attached.

95% of Deaf kids are born to hearing parents. Of those kids, only 10% of families sign with their kids and it's usually only one parent that learns and continues to sign with them as they age. [source](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/asl-language-acquisition/)

Students who have families that sign with them at home and classmates and teachers who sign exclusively (this means everyone switches to sign only when they enter the room) meet important developmental and educational milestones at the same rate and time as their hearing peers. This means that their grades and literacy levels are also similar to hearing peers of the same ages. 
Children who do not have signing families and constant language access often struggle academically, socially, and emotionally and many exhibit signs of brain damage due to isolation. [source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0142723719834102), [source 2](https://deafchildren.org/2019/02/why-deaf-children-need-asl/)

 You got this. Start using visual language with your child every time they're in the same room with you, and start attending Deaf events in your area if you aren't already to really jumpstart your signing skills. It might be difficult with Covid, but there are events starting up again.

Edit3: how to teach them to read when the time comes.

This is long and it's copied from an old comment of mine so the pronouns are wrong, but it's still applicable. Sorry for the growing text wall, friend. 

""One of the easiest ways to encourage a Deaf child to want to read words and learn to write is let them pick and check out a bunch of interesting-looking children's books from the library.  Learn to sign them all well enough that she can use you as a language model to read them together. s she comes across words she doesn't know, especially complex words that have prefixes or endings, compound words, or words with root words in them, cover parts of the word to make it look simpler. After she figures out the word, you can ask her to guess what it means based on the rest of the sentence and the picture or give her hints on things you might do with that word.  Show her the sign, fingerspell it, and show her the sign again. Then ask her what the entire sentence means in ASL.

1. Some of the most important stuff that helps tell stories to Deaf kids is making the characters in the book interact with the child you're signing with. For example, if theres a grasshopper, you'd fingerspell grasshopper, and then use the classifier to make it hop on the child and jump around. Usually, the kid will copy you or laugh.
2. Another is role-shifting. Make yourself into the character. This is similar to how hearing people will do voices when reading books to little kids and it has the same effect. Just as voices should match the personality of the character, the way the character moves and signs should match their personality. A good example of this is the **""Tortoise and the Hare""**. The Hare talks incredibly fast, is super hyper, always wants to get to the next thing, and the world moves to slow for him, so maybe he signs hectically and much smaller with sudden big movements. Maybe every sentence is really short. If he has to get the attention of another Deaf character, he stomps on the floor so fast it feels like a jack hammer. Then you can make the fast stomping vibration travel over to the child by pounding on the floor or the table with her.  The Turtle on the other hand shouldn't sign like the Hare. Maybe he signs reaaalllly sllllooowwwwly and gets other Deaf people's attention by flashing the lights instead. Since the Hare is really fast and the Tortoise signs slow, ask her how the Hare acts when talking with the Tortoise.
3. Come up with ways to get her involved in telling the story. Maybe she gets to do the ""sound effects"" for the story like pounding on the table, flashing the lights, or telling you what comes next or what she thinks will happen next. Since the Hare is really fast and the Tortoise signs slow, ask her how the Hare acts when talking with the Tortoise. When she gets more comfortable with the story, you each play one of the characters. You can make characters in the story Deaf and add your own features and Deaf cultural elements. It helps her identify the character as more relatable.
4. Something you can add in fairytales that always gets a good laugh is breaking physics. The ridiculousness of some things that happen in a story should match with the visuals. Think of older Disney cartoons or old Looney tunes ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXQ0GZHDCRc)). If something big falls, objects around it jump up and down or stretch in weird ways. You need to get them imagining what the story would look like. Once they learn that whole sentences are really just pictures, they start to attribute meanings to the content and see a point to learning it all. For me, once I figured out that reading is basically TV in my head, I couldn't put books down.

If you believe very strongly in a higher power who will do what's best and etc, why wouldn't you want the government to follow that higher power's ideals? This would be the reason why for topics like criminalizing homosexuality, or ending separation of church and state. Our higher power says no, so we think that the government should say no.

I can't really guess their logic on the fourth point, but that's mainly since I'm not exactly sure what ""Transgender rights"" *specifically* refers to, but it's likely related to a worldview where what many would call gender and sex are fully linked together/mean the same thing, and examples that contradict this(XXY, for example) are just exceptions. 

Some of the points one could probably argue, or at least ADF probably would, are religious freedom/general freedom issues. As LeBorisien says, the bullet point ""Preventing Jews from adopting"" is specifically about defending Christian-based agencies trying to only let certain people adopt kids from their agency, and in those cases preventing by discriminating by religion. I think the difference here is that the same sort of logic here could be used by a secular foster agency to discriminate against Christians from adopting their kids. I think most people would agree that this sort of discrimination is bad anyway, but there is a question of whether and how an *independent* foster agency is allowed to decide who can adopt and who can't(idk how they would have tried to defend it for the one that got public funding though). This topic seems similar to the ""baking a wedding cake for a gay couple"" debate.",1648771330

My perspective on this is based on pretty fundamental economics actually, just because you feel like being a dick and misreading/misinterpreting my comments doesn't negate the fact that government involvement (along with insurance, I never disputed that no matter how much you want to pretend I did) *raises* the prices.

"FacebookAds","t5_2yoxx","Consider this, you mentioned in a previous comment that you have a broad audience. A broad audience could mean anything honestly. Facebook has audience clusters. For ex. If your ads can reach say 40million people, its not necessary that all of them will see the ad. A small cluster of this 40mil will actually be exposed to your ad. Some may like it some may not. 
Now, let's say with your first adset you got lucky even with a broad audience, facebook was able to get your ad to the people who were interested. You got responses, facebook algorithm saw that you were getting results and created a profile of similar users in the backend, without telling you much.

This is where it gets interesting.

Now, if you decide to duplicate the ads. Facebook will treat this as a new thing altogether which means it will dive into your broad audience again to look for suitable clusters that can get you result, but this time. It may not be able to do so right away.

And there's where you get your difference in CTR. Coz although your targeted audience is the same. The cluster in that audience of yours will be different. Maybe in a different stage in the purchase cycle.

Hope this helps you understand the reason for the difference.",1648771331

I have started two sites that I treat like companies, and I have done and continue to do a lot of outreach.

Yesterday alone, I must have sent dozens of emails to companies involved in my second site's niche.

Thanks to outreach, I've managed to have four companies send or at least agree to send free tech products to review and counting, and I've only been ""CEO"" for less than a year.

Besides that, because of outreach as well, I've gained four teammates, with my favorite one being a guy who is willing to be the video presenter for my YouTube channel, which is better than if I do it because I'm uncomfortable showing my gorgeous face in a way that my attract unwanted fame.

As for everything else u said sure I get what u are saying but its a weapon that's its purpose to kill, guns don't kill, people kill/acceindts.

As for ur last statement, okay look UK is a fucking amazong example of that, they banned guns. Soo what happens? Knife crimes sky rocketed why? Coz if someone wants to kill u they will find a way to do it.

Also firearm related crimes are normally committed by unregistered gun owners (this is coming back to the point about UK)",1648771332

"BollyBlindsNGossip","t5_fknyy","If you want to understand stardom, look at Nichola, who doesn't speak the language and see how she reacts to SRK as opposed to the other actors in these clips. That's star power. She's politely reacting to all scenes, but she's really taken aback by the KKHH scene and her hands cross over her chest. That effect has very little to do with acting and everything to do with presence. You cannot orchestrate presence artificially. SRK translates on an elemental level for many women. It's something very raw. Only he has it. I see a lot of baffled posts these days asking why SRK is a star. Your answer is here. His presence translates without language on screen. It's just the X factor he has. Some have it, most don't. SRK has it. That's why an Irish girl from Galway, who never watched these films knows his name before watching these clips. That's why SRK is a superstar and the rest aren't.

Charitra is already in love with him which is not surprising. As someone also foreign who learned Hindi just to understand Shahrukh Khan in films, let me tell you, no other actor has what he has. That's why no one can touch him when it comes to sheer star power.",1648771332

"Vindicta","t5_22fx18","Idk coz I work as a stripper and I earn 6 figures a year whereas others in my club literally earn a low 4 figures in a year. The difference Is that big. I also get a lot of guys just walk up to me and offer me money so it‚Äôs not necessarily hard work. However some girls I work with think I‚Äôm ugly and they tell me ‚Äúit has nothing to do with looks you‚Äôre just very hardworking,‚Äù however I know this isn‚Äôt true since I get handed money super easily. 
However as a stripper you would immediately think a low trust face, whereas with me I‚Äôve been told I look really innocent for one. 

So like my coworkers tell me that the only reason I made the most money is because I look like the youngest one of everyone there (the girls there were 18-20 and I was slightly older than all of them.) they were trying to tell me that I‚Äôm not pretty I just look the youngest and men are pedos who get attracted to baby face children so that‚Äôs the only reason I attracted them because I‚Äôm otherwise not pretty enough to attract men. 

But my boyfriend says if I met him and told him I was 20 he literally wouldn‚Äôt believe me because I look at least early to mid 20s and he says sorry but you just honestly don‚Äôt look that young you just couldn‚Äôt pass as that young. 
And he thinks youthful looks are a really good thing that he‚Äôs actually attracted to so he would tell me as a compliment if he thought I did look young. 
So overall I guess looking young isn‚Äôt the only reason I‚Äôm a high earning stripper  however some men think I‚Äôm pretty and women hate my face and think I‚Äôm ugly and they assume I must be very hard working or assume I only make money for attracting pedophiles (many men including my bf don‚Äôt even think I look young though lmao)

In life outside of this I do get guys approach me try to flirt and offer to get me drinks and try to talk to me etc. I‚Äôve gotten a free coffee only a few times by guys too which is super sweet. Nothing like this has happened in a while but I‚Äôve been depressed and not gone out much either, 

And yes I do some very small scale modelling but tbh I know some below average models so it doesn‚Äôt mean much  and everyone here would agree they are below avg in my city, anyone who wants to model does where I live (honestly , I would show examples but I can‚Äôt doxx myself and others in my city)",1648771332

&gt; THURSDAY, 31 MARCH 2022, 16:31 - DANA HORDIYCHUK. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree on the payment for gas by EU countries in rubles, but nothing is likely to change for the EU;. He said this during a press briefing on Thursday, Kremlin media reported.

&gt; Putin&amp;#039;s decree concerning payment for gas in rubles applies only to Gazprom&amp;#039;s supply through pipelines.

&gt; As Putin himself said yesterday, nothing will change for companies in the EU and they will be able to continue paying in euros, while the bank will then convert the currency into rubles.

Now as I am getting older (68!!! horrors!!)

I have reached the point where skinny is way more desirable than even good looks!  Those are the physical attributes, and the mental attraction I find in guys I am attracted to, are they that could and need a hug, a caress, a helping hand, some good dad advice, some help that makes me feel able to respond in a dad way to their feminine, almost helpless ways some time... and I want to spoon with them and cuddle them and it really turns me on when a guy like this wants me to do that for him...

My mom had 110 shares of Tsla‚Ä¶ she went to a financial advisor and decided to use their service.

The financial advisor emailed back the same day saying not to worry that they won‚Äôt liquidate anything without her knowing what‚Äôs going on. 

She spoke with him on the phone at a later date and explained to him again that she wanted to keep her Tesla and Amazon stock. He said they could roll the account over and she could keep them.

She received a statement dated March 15 that all her shares were sold at $807/share. I spoke with him and asked for something in writing where she agreed to this. He said it was all negotiated over the phone and he didn‚Äôt have anything in writing. 

I called the guy and lost my cool.

Any lawyers?
Does she have grounds for a lawsuit?

Edit: as I was typing this the secretary of the company called and said she heard everything and didn‚Äôt think it was right (she was attached on the email asking not to sell the shares) she approached the owner and explained the situation and he wants to sit down with us.

Youch! That's a lot of work. Aside from that, it's also a good little romance short with some neat use of Zebra magic.

His lightning kick ability is busted and can knock down any non special enemy and send then flying (this can often kill).
He has an ability to heal from critical hits and if you knock an enemy down you get significantly more critical hits.
He has a single skill point ability to decrease the stamina usage from springing by 60%.

 &gt;John Philippe Rushton (December 3, 1943 ‚Äì October 2, 2012) was a Canadian psychologist and author. He taught at the University of Western Ontario until the early 1990s, and became known to the general public during the 1980s and 1990s for research on race and intelligence, race and crime, and other purported racial correlations. Rushton's work has been heavily criticized by the scientific community for the questionable quality of its research, with many academics arguing that it was conducted under a racist agenda.

This part is contradictory.  If they are the only ones left then the killer has more than started.  I also think you need to tell us what the cousins are doing about their predicament besides ""working together"".  Are they investigating and acting like armature detectives?  Do they set some kind of trap to catch the killer?  Do they go on the run or into hiding?  What crazy/funny thing are we paying money to watch them do?

&gt;who happen to be estranged cousins

I think you can leave out the ""happen to be"".  Maybe more like:

Two estranged cousins, a party loving socialite and an uptight attorney, team up and set a trap to catch the killer who is after their family fortune.

So Sarg knew about it, but didn't know the actual purpose.!&lt;

It's a sub point of OPs original post that we are discussing in this comment thread.

I agree if you mount it improperly and you do not fly a standard size American flag (or one that is reccomended for vehicles) that could be potentially dangerous and the driver would have to assume responsibility for the damages. There are a lot of common sense things you can do that are dangerous and can harm others as well, which is why we call these things accidents. Nobody would want to have their flag fly off their vehicle which is why there is a whole market for products made and tested to prevent such things, it's still the responsibility of the driver to mount it properly and drive responsibly.

A 50-year-old man tried to kill his cat in a train toilet on Tuesday afternoon. The animal made such loud noises that the ICE staff became aware of it and alerted the police, reports the Federal Police in Leipzig.

In the toilet, the officers discovered a completely wet and bloodied cat and temporarily took it into their care. The animal was injured and scared, the statement said.

According to T-Online, the ICE came from Berlin and was approaching Leipzig. However, the federal police officers waiting at the main station there were surprised by the find, because they had been incorrectly reported as a passenger without a ticket.

The 50-year-old was arrested for the time being and was later allowed to leave. Criminal proceedings were instituted against him for violating the Animal Welfare Act. The veterinary office took the cat to a vet where it will be examined further. She should be fine given the circumstances.""

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","Reminds me of Angron's (surprisingly coherent) argument with Guilliman in **Betrayer**


&gt;Guilliman ignored him, aiming a gauntlet at Angron. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve heard Lorgar‚Äôs puling heresies already. What brought you so low, brother? Did the machine in your skull finally refashion your loyalty into madness?‚Äô

&gt;‚ÄòHnnngh. They let me dream. They give me peace. What would you know of struggle, Perfect Son? Hnh? When have you fought against the mutilation of your mind? When have you had to do anything more than tally compliances and polish your armour?‚Äô

&gt;‚ÄòChildish,‚Äô Guilliman sighed, gesturing to the burning, dying city. ‚ÄòDoes it really come down to this? So pitiably childish.‚Äô

&gt;‚ÄòChildish? The people of your world named you Great One. The people of mine called me Slave.‚Äô Angron stepped closer, chainswords revving harder. ‚ÄòWhich one of us landed on a paradise of civilisation to be raised by a foster father, Roboute? Which one was given armies to lead after training in the halls of the Macraggian high-riders? Which one of us inherited a strong, cultured kingdom?‚Äô

&gt;Angron sprayed bloody spit as he frothed the words. ‚ÄòAnd which one of us had to rise up against a kingdom with nothing but a horde of starving slaves? Which one of us was a child enslaved on a world of monsters, with his brain cut up by carving knives?‚Äô

&gt;The two primarchs met again. Guilliman‚Äôs powered gauntlets should have easily deflected Angron‚Äôs chainswords, but the World Eater‚Äôs strength drove his brother back step by step. Chain-teeth sprayed from the weapons as eagerly as the saliva from Angron‚Äôs lipless slit of a mouth.

&gt;‚ÄòListen to your blue-clad wretches yelling of courage and honour, courage and honour, courage and honour. Do you even know the meaning of those words? Courage is fighting the kingdom that enslaves you, no matter that their armies overshadow yours by ten thousand to one. You know nothing of courage. Honour is resisting a tyrant when all others suckle and grow fat on the hypocrisy he feeds them. You know nothing of honour.‚Äô

"politics","t5_2cneq","This entire conversation proves the vagueness of the bill.

But let's look at lines 97-101.  Let's look at the terms used.

""Classroom instruction""  You said it was limited to curriculum.  You said it was later defined as such in the bill.  There is no clarification of this section that indicates it was limited to curriculum.  The mention of curriculum later is a whole other topic.  If this was defined, you would not have that misconception.  You made that assumption because the wording is vague.

""sexual orientation or gender identity""  You have focused on how this section keeps your kid from learning about sex acts before third grade.  Gender identity has nothing to do with sex acts, but that is what you have been hammering on about.  Asexuals exist but can still express themselves a gender other than what they were assigned at birth.  However, the fact that orientation was brought up and not defined allowed you to go down this entire rabbit hole of ""they are going to teach my five year old about what his uncle and partner do behind closed doors!""  And you were able to do that because the bill does not define sexual orientation and you chose to ignore gender identity.

This is my last comment reply to you.  You are obsessed with the idea that someone was going to teach your 5 old about oral and anal.  However, the guy that wrote the bill brought up specifically mentioning a lesbian couple being something kids needed protection from.  

You are pushing your specific agenda onto a bill that has nothing to do with what the guy that wrote it wanted.

And since you are doubling, tripling, quadrupling down on ignoring parts to push your agenda, then I have no further time in my life for you.

You are standing up to be counted with those that want to push LGBT+ back into the closet at best.  I have nothing further to say to you as you are going to help them based on your own fairy tale version of the bill.

You are not part of some righteous cause.  You are part of a hate group.

&gt; Aid workers and journalists taken hostage in Syria by a group of British Islamic State militants were forced to fight each other until they passed out, a US court has heard.

&gt; The Italian-born aid worker Federico Motka, who grew up in the UK, told the federal courthouse that he and David Haines, a British fellow aid worker, were made to fight John Cantlie, a British war correspondent and photographer, and the American journalist James Foley, in what the militant group called a &amp;quot;Royal rumble&amp;quot;.

&gt; Motka said he and the other hostages endured a lengthy &amp;quot;Regime of punishment&amp;quot; when held at the site, including frequent beatings and forced stress positions.

Overall, it‚Äôs not too bad. You get used to the people on your floor and it‚Äôs less like a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs restroom‚Äù and more like a restroom for all of your neighbors which happen to be women. I personally choose the hall style bathrooms over suite style because I could get a single room, which really helped with my feelings of gender alienation. It really helps with mentally separating myself from being on the ‚Äúwomens floor‚Äù.

It personally took me several weeks before I felt comfortable working out around other people and even more to deal with my personal mental issues that prevent me from working out at all. Simply having a physical space where I can try to better myself is with more than $$ so the idea of ruining that for someone else is way not okay.

Sin.     0.      1.         2.      3.         4.      (Write from 0-4)
Cos.    4.      3.         2.      1.         0.      (Write from 4-0)

Then divide every number by four

            0        30.        45.      60.      90
Sin.     0/4.    1/4         2/4     3/4       4/4

Cos.    4/4     3/4        2/4      1/4        0/4     

Then put everything in square root and simplify


           0    30             45               60              90

It‚Äôs not recommended to go for stargazing till you‚Äôve built 3-6 heroes of the core factions. This will enable you to ascend the towers and earn Stargazing Cards from them, plus advance campaign and other modes, so it‚Äôs a win-win.

Definitely do Rowan before Lucretia. Rowan is insanely useful and you can use him in virtually every single level for the rest of the game.

Grezhul‚Äôs 9/9 is really really good. It‚Äôs a little less useful in the earlier chapters; I don‚Äôt recall when it really starts being powerful. It might be smarter to build up several weaker but still great units like Lyca, Tasi, Thoran, Ferael, etc. rather than going all in on Grez. 

I recommend saving your red emblems for Rowan. His +30 is just that good!

You can find a lot of good guides and tier lists throughout this subreddit (I just recommend sorting by recent, since the meta will occasionally change)

Seg√∫n cifras entragadas por el banco central, con los 2 primeros retiros (Vale decir apenas el 20% de todo el dinero que est√° en el sistema) las AFP entregaron USD 33.320 MM sin considerar el porcentaje de personas que no retiraron, o que pasaron los montos a la cta 2, que en rigor, significa no retirar.

en palabras simples amigo mio, el monto que mencionas para sustentar el sistema de reparto, Usd 18.000MM, no alcanza a ser la mitad del 20% de todo el dinero que tienen hoy las AFP.

A√∫n crees que no es viable?  

Ojo, el sistema de reparto, est√° presente en el 90% de todos los paises del mundo, incluyendo aquellos que tienen los mejores niveles de vida y los mejores servicios p√∫blicos gratu√≠tos.

Harps or slab roller and square/hex cookie  cutters are fast ways to make them from scratch. There's also molds you can buy, though they can be a bit pricey and take longer. In the long run though tile making is extremely difficult and the equipment and materials get expensive quickly. 

Your best bet is to get some of the tiles I linked and find a pottery shop that will let you use their kiln. You can either buy the glazes yourself ($) or ask if you can pay a fee and use the shop glazes. Just be sure to look at the temperature of the tiles and the glazes you use. Most pre-bisqued tiles are low fire (cone 04-06) so will need low fire glazes and to be fired at the lower temperatures otherwise it will melt into a puddle in the bottom of the kiln. If you use a mid or hire fire glaze on the low fire tile and try to fire it at a lower temp then the glaze won't set. For low fire glazes I really like Mayco Elements and  Jungle Gems.

Also low fire has a zero in front ex: cone 05
High fire does not ex: cone 5

There's hundred of degrees in difference so pay close attention and make sure the owner of the kiln you use knows what you're using and the temperature to fire at.",1648771344

I've found a great store in another state that sells online too and they always try to match dye lots. An dif they can't they let you know. Unfortunately they don't stock a lot of basic yarns like cottons and bamboos in a wide range of colours.

So I still use lovecrafts.com to order bulk lots of particular yarns.

"node","t5_2reca","I think the most appropriate status code here would be 303 - See Other.  Usually it's used with POST/PUT to indicate that a browser refresh shouldn't try to do the post again - in essence it turns whatever method you had into a GET.  I think the idea is you provide a Location header with the request.  I'm not sure off hand if it works with DELETE but it should I think.  (by calling `res.redirect` you're setting the Location header on the response, which user agents are supposed to follow -- that's the redirect mechanism.  Not sure how express deals with 303, if at all -- I would think it would be up to the user agent to handle that status specially.)

\&gt; found you can change the HTTP method mid-function

I'm not sure that's accurate, not with express anyway.  When you initialize the server, it creates a series of routing rules based on calls to app.get/delete/all/etc. If the code has already reached the controller function, it's too late to change the method.  You can set it, but it won't have any effect.  It would be like overwriting req.body with your own value.",1648771347

"ChicagoFireNBC","t5_2usdz","To me, he's the second-worst character Gabby gets that front spot by a long far.

I hate him for lots of reasons, he's weird as crap. He on many occasions expressed interest in wanting to sleep with Kelly and Shay's sloppy seconds and is the entire reason he wanted to live with them, so he could bang the previously banged.

The dude has no respect for his friends wanting to date every girl in the show, even if his ""BFF"" Cruz dated the girl first.

Not to metnion moving his grandma in with no, to little warning.

Dude wasn't the slightest bit likable to mewith Cruz.

Then he complains that mills is being groomed for Squad early on. When Otis has made zero effort to take extra courses, or try hard, or anything. He acted like it should be offered to him because he's been there longer?

He whines and cries about his job and position without doing anything to actively change it until he finally gets to drive the truck, which he sucks at and he pretty much had to pay to get.

He cries about not being able to get girls constantly.

He's a hateful dude, who thinks his shit doesn't stink because he's a firefighter because he sits with the cool kids.

Whenever he had those weird sick episodes/or getting shot in the neck (Totally hilarious moment, the only way Otis would get shot would be from a bullet over heating LOL) he just acts like he's way to tough for help, he doesn't need it. 

His relentless teasing of Mouch was probably my breaking point.

He often made situations 10x times worse by how he reacted to them, etc Severides friend joining and ducking out of a call.

Dude is just portrayed and is supposed to be the lovable dork but he's far from lovable he's more like that weird dork that gets super anal about each rule and would cry when he loses.

"TheVampireDiaries","t5_2sctw","I've seen a lot of people say this, so it seems pretty normal.

I think it's because while in some ways ""Team Damon"" might be more superficially exciting, if you actually look at the relationships Damon-Elena was incredibly dysfunctional from start to finish. Stefan-Elena had its difficulties no doubt, but by and large their relationship was actually quite mature.

They generally talked to each other about their troubles openly and acknowledged each other's boundaries. Unlike with Damon who constantly lies and never respects Elena's boundaries.

Stefan and Elena are equal partners in a loving relationship, Damon always puts himself in the superior position to Elena in their relationship, always forcing his will on to her. And that's quite childish and bad for a relationship.

So I suspect that as you yourself become mature the effect of hormones goes down (ie the effect of the ""excitement"" factor) and you recognise more and more through experience the importance of having a mature relationship where both partners are equal, open with each other and respect each other's boundaries. Which is something, it seems to me, you only really start to fully appreciate as you gain experience with relationships IRL.",1648771348

Sounds like you didn't actually read the article.

&gt;The story of Jesus is simply a conglomerate tale of many other historical figures depicted well before the tale.

This is simply untrue.  No reputable scholars of the field accept this notion.
&gt;The gospel of Mary states the two keys to heaven and hell were left in the hands of a woman, not a man. That information is directly contrary to so many other books that they must have left it out.

gMary was never accepted by the proto-Orthodox church for a few centuries before Nicaea.  And while the 4 canonical Gospels are not eyewitness accounts (or even close to), they still have a far better pedigree than gMary.

# Uesugi Clan

&amp;#x200B;

The Uesugi clan (‰∏äÊùâÊ∞è, Uesugi-shi, historically also Uyesugi) is a Japanese samurai clan which was at its most powerful during the Muromachi and Sengoku periods (14th to 17th centuries).^(\[1\]) At its height, the clan had three main branches: the ≈ågigayatsu,   
Inukake, and Yamanouchi. Its most well-known member is the warlord Uesugi Kenshin (1530‚Äì1578).^(\[2\])

During the Edo period, the Uesugi were a *tozama* or outsider clan, in contrast with the *fudai* or inner daimy≈ç clans, which had been hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan.^(\[1\])

&amp;#x200B;

# History

The clan claims descent from the Fujiwara clan, specifically Fujiwara no Yoshikado,^(\[2\]) who was a *daijo-daijin* during the 9th century.

Kanjuji Shigefusa was a 13th generation descendant of the clan's great progenitor and originator of the clan's name. Near the end of the 13th century, he received the Uesugi domain in Tango province and adopted the name ""Uesugi"" after arriving and establishing himself there.^(\[2\])

**Muromachi period** \[edit\]

Throughout the Muramachi period, members of the clan were appointed as shugo (provincial governors) and would regularly hold sway over the post Kant≈ç Kanrei (shogun's deputy in Kant≈ç). 

Through their dominance of this position, the clan gained a large amount of power in the Kant≈ç region. In 1449, Kant≈ç Kanrei Ashikaga Shigeuji killed his Uesugi deputy in order to check the family's power. However, Uesugi forces rose up throughout the region and drove out Shigeuji. After ousting the Kanrei, they asked the shogunate in Kyoto for a different deputy to be placed in power.

These three branches would commence infighting for dominance within the clan and the Kant≈ç region almost as soon as the split occurred. This conflict would continue for roughly twenty-five years until around the end of the ≈ånin War in 1477, which brought the end of the Ashikaga shogunate. Though the ≈ågigayatsu and Yamanouchi branches both survived this conflict, the Inukake did not.  


**Sengoku period** \[edit\]

Traditionally, the ≈ågigayatsu branch allied themselves with the ≈åta clan, while the Yamanouchi were aligned with the Nagao clan. While the ≈ågigayatsu were less numerous than the Yamanouchi, they held on to power due to ≈åta D≈çkan's construction of the Edo Castle in the 1450s. At the same time as the Uesugi branches continued to compete for power with themselves, the H≈çj≈ç clan began to gain power in the lower area of the Kant≈ç region. The first head of this rising clan, H≈çj≈ç S≈çun, allied himself with Nagao Tamekage, Deputy Constable of Kamakura, and would go on to become one of their strongest rivals.

Near the end of the Sengoku period, the Uesugi would undergo major changes in their leadership. Uesugi Norimasa, holder of a castle which had fallen in 1551 to the H≈çj≈ç, took up arms with his retainer Nagao Kagetora. Kagetora would go on to change his name to Uesugi Kenshin after campaigning against the H≈çj≈ç in Sagami Province.  
 Kenshin would later become one of Sengoku's most prominent generals,   
continuing to wage war against the H≈çj≈ç for control of the Kant≈ç region.  
 Kenshin's adopted son Uesugi Kagekatsu eventually became head of the Uesugi clan. However, his support of Ishida Mitsunari during the battle of Sekigahara would result in a devastating blow to the power of the Uesugi, as Mitsunari's forces were crushed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and his supporters.  


**Edo period** \[edit\]

During the Edo period, the Uesugi were given the domain of Yonezawa, a Tozama daimy≈ç worth 300,000 koku. The domain, located far from the capital in the T≈çhoku region, was considered fairly representative of what might be given to daimy≈ç considered ""outsiders"" by the shogunate. Yonezawa had minimal direct control from the shogunate, but was not urbanized and was largely an agricultural domain.^(\[1\])

Despite agricultural advances and generally high growth in the 17th century, Yonezawa, like most parts of the country, experienced a considerable drop in growth after 1700. The official koku revenue of the Uesugi daimy≈ç was cut in half in 1664, but the family maintained its same expensive lifestyle as before. After Yonezawa entered debt and experienced famine in the 1750s, the current daimy≈ç Uesugi Shigesada considered giving the territory back to the shogunate. Instead, he allowed his adopted son Uesugi Harunori to take over as daimy≈ç. Through agricultural and moral reforms, as well as other strict policies, Harunori was able to restore a measure of prosperity to the domain. After his death, the shogunate officially praised Yonezawa as an example of good governance.",1648771350

You can see from this, the flow going out is strong and opposing that coming in.

But the % that Russia might see a handover of potential offensive wepons that could attack Russias soil as an act of aggression from NATO isn't 0. We can guess. Some experts might say theres a 10% likelihood others might say 50% or 1%.   but that perceived act of aggression on Russia could be all the justification putin needs to attack Europe or America potentially in a nuclear way.  We cannot afford to fuck around and find out when it comes to nukes. NATO would rather deliver non offensive weapons that cannot be used to attack Russia than poke a deranged dragon. 

ultimately America and the members of NATO are interested in protecting them and their state. In all reality NATO could of turned a blind eye and left Ukraine to fend for itself. They might be helping Ukraine because they want to degrade and grade Russia. Its in the best interest of NATO for Ukraine to tear apart the Russian armed forces and potentially cause the collapse of the Russian military. NATO was created to counterbalance the USSR.  If Russia hypothetically wins but is completely drained and cannot wage another war successful for at least a decade then the gamble payed off.

*****
&gt; After weeks of intense fight, Russian troops were ordered to abandon Hostomel Airport on March 31 and they are believed to head to Belarus for regrouping.

&gt; Hostomel -also known as Antonov Airport- was deemed as key in the first hours of the invasion in late February, and the fight to control -and for Ukrainian forces, to recover- the airfield had a significant cost, both in personnel and equipment.

&gt; Russian forces were deployed by helicopters in Hostomel during the first hours of the invasion, where they met severe resistance.

""Manly and Confident"". What does that bring to mind? Emotional and anxious? Or maybe stoic and unfazed by anything that comes their way?

A lot of people are telling you that you shouldn't have to change at all. How would *they* know? This should be an opportunity for some self-evaluation. Like your emotions and high anxiety...does that get in the way of actually getting shit done? If so, maybe your girlfriend is legit giving you valuable feedback but doesn't have the tools to phrase it better.

*****
&gt; After weeks of intense fight, Russian troops were ordered to abandon Hostomel Airport on March 31 and they are believed to head to Belarus for regrouping.

&gt; Hostomel -also known as Antonov Airport- was deemed as key in the first hours of the invasion in late February, and the fight to control -and for Ukrainian forces, to recover- the airfield had a significant cost, both in personnel and equipment.

&gt; Russian forces were deployed by helicopters in Hostomel during the first hours of the invasion, where they met severe resistance.

"Kotlin","t5_2so2r","What about using the boxed wrapper list you got by calling `IntArray.asList()` in the primary constructor to satisfy the compiler and have correct default `hashCode` etc but still storing the `IntArray` as a separate property in that class to be able to access that later? I mean you said that the important thing for you is that you can still access the array. Also, in terms of the amount of boxing here, this is the same as your wrapper class `IntArrayCompareContent`.

```kotlin
data class Foo(
  val blah: List&lt;Int&gt;,
) {
    lateinit var blahRaw: IntArray
}
```

Not an ideal solution, because of `lateinit` and all, but it seems like you do not care about comfort in this example and more about just having access to that array and not having to write those `hashCode` and `equals` functions manually.

And in the end: If performance is not absolutely critical here, just use `List&lt;Int&gt;`. Its more convenient, works great with kotlinx.serialization and all collection operation extension functions defined for Arrays in Kotlin convert the Array to a List anyways.",1648771354

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","&gt;Ranni and the Black Knives worked together to kill Godwyn, but it seems pretty clear that they hate her now, especially considering many of the things that happen near the end/after Ranni‚Äôs questline is finished.

It's very vague, iirc she admits to stealing the rune. She doesn't admit to planning to have Godwyn killed, just that it's what happened. Her ending is still arguably the best for the lands between and your own character, sure she's a little cryptic but her intentions are well meant.

There's still so much we don't know about Marika/Maliketh and Godwyn especially. Hard to decisively say whether or not Ranni played a part in it, it's still her fault for stealing the rune in the first place but she may not have planned that far ahead.

I mean she goes into hiding for the better part of her questline and would likely have stayed that way if not for us helping her.

Also Alecto is locked up nearby the Carian Manor in an evergaol so that could be Ranni's doing and why they hate her. They also could be working for the Two Fingers after all this time, it's presumably been decades since the shattering.",1648771354

I do see the problems with this bill. Namely I don't understand how this bill is going to prevent school officials taking elementary children to gay bars.
Even if the bar disallows all sexual acts it is still a bar and no place for a young child.

"productivity","t5_2qh1k","Need advice on how to structure my time for self improvement and hobbies. On weekdays I wake up at 4 for school; I have sports so I come back home at either 6 or 8 depending on if we are away. If I come back at 6 I tutor for an hour, and then I go to the gym, if its 8 I go to the gym. At this point, its kinda late to do stuff and I try to sleep before 10. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I just resign myself to waiting until weekends (tbh on weekends its hard to find motivation to be completely productive cause I wanna relax as well, on weekdays since I start the day somewhat productive it steamrolls but on weekends once I start to relax its over). Do I try to optimize my time in school cause I finish work early (i want to have social time to improve though as well).

&amp;#x200B;

Hobbies / stuff im trying to improve: reading, crochet, learning computer science stuff(java, databases, certifications), applying to summer programs, applying to internships, cooking (i at least started by cooking breakfasts), get better at my sport, stocks, improve fashion sense.

Also, what do you do during those small &lt;5 min breaks where its too short to pull out a book or somethin so you end up just going on your phone

"DeathBattleMatchups","t5_2sj683","Yes, they have used non-canon but only when it lines up with the source material. Take *Tekken: Blood Vengeance* for example, which they didn't use anything from because Jin gained new abilities in that film that are nowhere to be seen in the games. It's not just a matter of canonicity, it's about whether the non-canon stuff can be considered consistent. Or *Kill La Kill: IF*, which also wasn't used because it was significantly outside of Ryuko's normal capabilities in both stats and in powers. In comparison, Tatsumaki's meteor feat isn't canon but it is consistent with her power in the manga, which is why they used it. 

With the *MLP* comics, there are enough instances of show contradiction that they are considered by some be a separate timeline. But like I said, there is debate around it, and it's not clear as to what Death Battle's approach would be (if they ever actually touch *My Little Pony* again). My conclusion is that they'd most likely disregard them due to the multiple contradictions and the vastly greater power levels shown, but it's also possible that they may consider it solid enough to count as supporting evidence.

And as for the sun and moon moving stuff, I'm mostly with you there, though I'm not fully convinced that Luna would actually be able to move the sun due to a few complications. Regardless, apparently the Necrozma scaling for Lunala puts her at Galaxy to Universe level (I'm not entirely sure) so it's possible that the buffs from the comics may be meaningless anyway. But that could also be complete bunk so it's important to have all the bases covered.",1648771355

Oh honey‚Ä¶. Your cringe attempts at getting a single point aren‚Äôt working.

I made the meme. I did it myself. And I used the flag flown by every single one of the thousands of confederate apologists I‚Äôve seen, online and in real life. The only place I‚Äôve seen the actual National flags of the confederacy is online, on fucking Wikipedia. None of your soup brained brethren know the right flag.

Just like the ‚Äúcountry‚Äù you‚Äôre defending, you have a history of taking fat L‚Äôs. 

&gt;1.) Thats a red herring. 

No it isn‚Äôt, because your initial statement was, and I quote, ‚ÄúAbe Lincoln got voted into office and didnt receive a single vote from the south. So states rights to be heard and represented.‚Äù

If Abraham Lincoln received a single vote from a state that could be considered southern, this statement is false.

Even your corrected statement, redirected to electoral college votes, is no defense of the south literally starting the civil war. That‚Äôs not how that works, bub.


&gt;explicitly stated in the Declaration of causes of secedeing states. But good attempt at deception.

You don‚Äôt want to get into the Declaration, it has plenty of other explicit statements that run quite counter to the explicit goals of the confederacy. ;)

&gt;And skipping to number 3.) Man, you are just as illiterate as the southern stereotype. What part of 'then sure' did you not understand. 

Oh man, you keep owning yourself. You‚Äôve been amusing me a lot with your long off topic rants.

‚ÄúThen sure‚Äù is literally not an answer for the question ‚Äúwhat will your response be‚Äù. 

I know you lack literacy, but a ‚Äúresponse‚Äù is an action. ‚ÄúThen sure‚Äù is not a type of action.

In addition to the fluid retention, the volume, not the calories, of the food impacts weight as your body processes it (did you pee/poop?). Weight gain is not the same thing as fat gain.

Second, if you are being so restrictIve that you binge, clearly that is not sustainable for you. Additionally it is unnecessary. All that is necessary is a slight calorie deficit. The cookies ruined no one‚Äôs diet ever. What ruins the diet is the thin mink that I ate three cookies so I might as well eat the all, and eat more, and give up. THAT ruins your diet. It is just food. There is no good or bad food. Of course, some of it is more nutritious and you should eat mostly that. I have something sweet every day. I work it into my calorie count for the day.  Because I know I can eat it and it is not ‚Äúbad‚Äù or restricted, And because I can have more tomorrow if I want, I do not crave it and binge. Free yourself.

I too hate the idea of Kalibr cruise missiles in apartment buildings but I am fairly ambivalent to Ukrainians in isolation of the Russian invasion. 

I do not feel any stronger about the current Ukranian suffering than I did compared to Iraqi, or now Yemeni or Myanmarese. 

I'm okay with Ukrainians caring first for their own and not bawling their eyes over Iraqis. That's how it should be. Fight your fight. I'm okay with the Baltics, Poland, Romania doing the same. But others need to check their moral compass. 

Any government that governs here, I would want them to figure out how to manouver this as good as they can to pull out the best outcome for us. 

States don't act morally. They put on a morality cloak when what is moral happens to align with what's in their interest. Anyone who thinks otherwise is naive.

Monster Hunter Rise might not have loot boxes (I'm taking your word for it about it only having cosmetics) or p2w, but it is still microtransactions.

As for the list of games in the regions, nintendo games are pretty much the exception of games that doesn't have it, tho there is also an exception inside that exception of the few nintendo games that does have it (and as a side note Super Smash Bros Ultimate has P2W). You can nitpick all the exceptions you want. The fact of the matter is that it is a big trend, one that even Valve started doing. If you have to go for region based games to try to strenghten your argument in favour of microtransaction then I think you are desperately grasping for straws at that point.

I‚Äôll rephrase your desired rate of return as the minimum you‚Äôd be willing to accept. It would not cause stock prices to plummet if everyone used the minimum they‚Äôd be willing to accept as their discount rate.",1648771356

4) Sasuke is on the fastest characters in Naruto, and no he wasn't out of chakra, Deidara assumed that but rather it was that Sasuke got injured by his own Chidori to neutralize the bombs.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I've never looked into this so I don't know what device could help you, but I want to gently say that if she's a good kid she'll probably wear her seatbelt at all times (I was raised with the knowledge that if belts weren't on the car didn't move) and if she speeds she'll learn her lesson when she gets pulled over for it.

I live in Oklahoma and recently there was an accident in Tishomingo. You might have heard about it, I think it made national news. From what I understand of it, a 16 year old that must have just started driving decided to fit five friends into a car meant to sit only four people, and she ran a stop sign. Got T-boned by a semi, all six people ended up dying and the semi driver lost his job and probably his license even though he wasn't at fault. Only one person in the car was wearing their seatbelt.

If you want to show her the article, I'm sure it'll go aways to teach her half the needed lesson. To wear a seatbelt at all times and probably more important, to obey stop signs and respect a semi truck. They can't just hit their brakes like a normal car can, and for that reason they can't slow down like a normal car can. 

But again, you said she was a good kid, so I'm sure she'll do fine on the roads. And if she gets a speeding ticket, so be it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",1648771356

We can‚Äôt help it that we generate so much money for the league, we can‚Äôt help that we‚Äôre the centre of the hockey universe, we leafs fans‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre everywhere‚Ä¶ deal with it bitches!! üòÇüòÇ

Also, Fans getting irate because of the media coverage we get, specially here in Southern Ontario, where the LEAFS PLAY!! Is just fucking ridiculous. Of course we‚Äôre gonna have the most coverage here, but also, the other sports stations in southern Ontario cover all the other teams and other leagues also. It‚Äôs like saying in Montreal, they mostly have coverage on the Habs and sometimes they highlight the other teams‚Ä¶ well no shit Sherlock! Lol, that goes for all the other NHL teams in their regions. 

Fans living in Ontario that are not leafs fans, should not complain one bit, you know you‚Äôre in leafs nation, either deal with it or get the fuck out! And follow your team in their own city!

It‚Äôs never good to have children with the expectation that you‚Äôll have help outside of you and your partner. Even when they offer, take it with a grain of salt.

Give yourself some time. I find it‚Äôs a lot easier by 2yo. 

6 months is just a super rough time, still the baby stage. Just reassess where you‚Äôre at every 6 months. 

It gets a lot better, I promise.",1648771357

Agreed, it's super weird how, as much as we tell ourselves we aren't or we won't develop feelings, it happens anyway.

I used to ask him all the time if he could come and see me, but he always had a reason why he couldn't. I've stopped asking because I found it pointless since he was always declining, but at the same time don't really have the emotional energy to search all over again for someone right now when he and I already have somewhat, be it not much, of a physical history together, but we've also got a wealth of information on each other, if that makes any sense.

Combining armor with a stat that can be used for mobility was a mistake.

So they have high endurance? They can run faster and have heavy armor? It makes no sense even from a thematic perspective. Ideally there should be an endurance cost for wearing heavy armor if it were fair, or a stamina reduction; but no, armor wearers are all marathon runners. Fits perfectly.",1648771359

"analytics","t5_2rhz9","In my experience, Bayesian methods are way more useful than frequentist methods in business. Two main reasons:

* They make more intuitive sense to someone without statistical training, and more closely model how business decisions are actually made in the real world
* They are better at dealing with limited information

The second reason is something that I don't think gets talked about nearly enough. A classic example is forecasting in corporate finance - companies prepare financial results monthly, so trying to get an effective ARIMA model working can be tricky when you have only 12 observations a year. Starting with a prior and then updating as the results come in makes a lot of sense.

I genuinely think that in 50 years, Bayesian methods will be the standard in the business world.",1648771359

*I sigh, letting it pass over my lips while my legs take me over to the guard at my right. I tap on his chest, just twice, to get his attention.* ‚ÄúYou see that guy over there?‚Äù

*He nods.* ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ he ain‚Äôt as important as this aisle.‚Äù 

*Alright.* ‚ÄúSo, even if he‚Äôs crashing the wedding‚Ä¶‚Äù

*He rolls his head from side to side.* ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd have to do a lot to do that‚Ä¶ take out the grooms, toss the tents‚Ä¶ the man‚Äôs got his work cut out for him if he‚Äôs trying something like that.‚Äù

*I nod, and think.* ‚ÄúSay, why don‚Äôt you go check the purple tents. I think I hear the groom calling for someone.‚Äù

*He runs off to the tents, checking them quick‚Ä¶ gives me a little time to think.*

* Anything I can see within five meters of me can get heavier or lighter. If I leave that range, the effect sticks for ten seconds.
* Timofey‚Ä¶ T. His stand? [I].
* I‚Äôve got three knives, one for throwing, he‚Äôs got two airguns.. I‚Äôll shift them into my pockets, just in case.
* If I see a button‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have the strength to pull it out, so if it‚Äôs attached to something, I‚Äôll pick the thing up before I tap the button down, so the mass shift doesn‚Äôt change much. Heck, if it moves the thing with enough force to move it a meter‚Ä¶ its mass dropped by 99%, so I can stop it barehanded, nice and easy.
* Even if normal partygoers can‚Äôt, the guards can see T‚Äôs buttons.
* Objects are generally designed to hold their weight, and weight is a product of mass. By shifting the center of mass, more weight will be on a specific point in an object. So, if all of the weight is focused on the point where things are more likely to break‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôll figure it out.
* I‚Äôm pretty light on my feet, and my stand keeps me that way. Don‚Äôt expect it to ever come off, though.
* To boil down force vectors since I don‚Äôt have too much time: if it takes ten newtons to move a one-kilogram object one meter, it would take one tenth of a newton to move a one-hundredth of a kilogram one meter. In layman's terms: if something‚Äôs mass drops, so too does the force needed to move it.

*The first thing my hands go for is the camera. While my eyes skirt over to the tents, lowering their mass enough to let them sway a little in the breeze- gotta keep track of their shoes, man, and bowling shoes are easy to spot- my hands hold the thing sideways.*

*I make my way down the aisle. I‚Äôve only got a few minutes before the saints come marching in, so I‚Äôve got to make sure everything‚Äôs good and ready.*

*The guests are seated, neat- ah, there‚Äôs T. He‚Äôs not in one of the chairs, but it looks like‚Ä¶*

*I slide down on and next to one of the guests, with the camera in hand.* ‚ÄúMorning, miss. You‚Äôre looking lovely today.‚Äù *She laughs, it‚Äôs a courtesy laugh.* ‚ÄúAre you alright? Would like a bottle of water, perhaps?‚Äù

*While she decides on yes or no, I curl the camera around, behind her head. If T‚Äôs off putting buttons on shrubs or chairs, I‚Äôve gotta get good photos of them.*

*A few other voices ask for water, one asks for a towel- standard beach stuff. While I‚Äôm there, I take a second to weigh down all the sand I can see- sure, it‚Äôs surface level, but it‚Äôs rough, coarse, and gets everywhere- best to keep it down low, I think.*

*I make for the closest tent, stopping off at any buttons I see. I already told you my thoughts on this, but, if it looks like he coated the place, I‚Äôll have a quick chat with my friend right next to the tent. If he could do me a quick solid and gather up all of the objects with buttons on them- or at least tell me where they are if he can‚Äôt- I‚Äôd owe him one.*

*I grab what the guests need- Ah, there, right there! I snap a quick photo of the guard trying to pick up one of the shrubs with T in shot. I click my tongue- the camera‚Äôs sideways, so I got a few guests messing around in frame‚Ä¶ Well, no time like the present. I get back to our lovely guests and give them their waters, towels, and whatever else- is that a button on your shoe?*

*Right, the guests‚Ä¶ T can coat them and their clothes with the buttons‚Ä¶ Think man! I can weigh down those air pellets if I see them coming, but they‚Äôre way too small to judge long-distance‚Ä¶ I could cut the cloth around the button out, but that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a bit much, especially for a party scene‚Ä¶ what to do‚Ä¶*

*Well, they‚Äôll change the center of mass to that spot if it‚Äôs on their person. I‚Äôll elegantly tap the button down while trying to make polite conversation, or, better, make sure that the guests don‚Äôt get them in the first place, but where‚Äôs-*

*I take a snapshot of T dumping some of the water bottles on a guest! It‚Äôs not much skin off of my nose, or, it wouldn‚Äôt be if I wasn‚Äôt getting paid.* ‚Äú**Timofey**!‚Äù *The best thing about knowing somebody‚Äôs name is, there‚Äôs two big responses to hearing your voice.*

*In the first, you get a crisp, clean snapshot of them with their head swiveled around like mom just called them for dinner in the middle of a video game session.*

*In the second, they run away, barreling for the nearest hiding spot‚Ä¶ but this big man might not want to run. He might just gussy himself back up, say ‚Äòyes‚Äô, or even shoot right back at me. That‚Äôs fine, any delay on his part is another second I‚Äôve got to get closer.*

*I‚Äôve got a wedding to officiate and this guy‚Äôs out here making a fuss‚Ä¶ man if you wanted to cool off, the ocean‚Äôs ten feet that way! I shake my head and go grab more water, and more towels- the tents? seriously?*

*Even if the tents have their centers of mass shifted, they‚Äôll stay put. I can hold the taps in one hand, so it‚Äôs not a big deal to press the buttons on or around them. It‚Äôs just more time wasted‚Ä¶ Man, this guy‚Äôs a louse!*

*It hits me- the music tables! What if he buttoned the records? Does this guy have no appreciation for music?*

*I stop at the next guard, asking him to check over the pianist‚Äôs keyboard, and to give me a thumbs‚Äô up if he finds anything. Nice and discreet, the way I like it.*

*My eyes are on the records- one, two, three‚Ä¶ mostly intact, so it must be the‚Ä¶ now that‚Äôs just plain weird. With the camera over one eye, I catch a shot of a smiling guard giving me a solid thumbs‚Äô up and Timofey walking out of a tent, water bottle in the process of being crushed against his head. Might as well tack on littering to disturbing the- oh, the tent‚Ä¶*

*I shake my head, and spare a second to take the records out of the box, putting them under an arm while the box holds up the center of the table.*

*Then I bolt over to the keyboard, asking the guard heading back the other way to do me another quick solid- this is three, four now? I‚Äôve got maybe one minute before the shindig starts‚Ä¶* ‚ÄúCan you do me another solid and take down the tarps?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo sir. Those‚Äôre part of the displays, so they‚Äôve got to stay up.‚Äù *Another long sigh, one for the record books, slips past my lips.* ‚ÄúI could probably get all the stuff in them out, sure, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I get it. The logistics of moving those tables into broad daylight might be a little too much‚Ä¶ could you do me a different solid and **pick up any litter you see, like bottles, dropped towels, and the like?** we don‚Äôt have long before the whole thing starts‚Ä¶‚Äù

*He dips, and I have another minute to think‚Ä¶*",1648771360

I‚Äôve read the full text via my Wikipedia Library access and it does state that the generally accepted historical interpretation points towards the bill being introduced as a tactic to ward off future tariffs by blaming the Northerners for voting against it, as the South repeatedly blocked any attempt from the North to admend it, but the author appears to be suggesting an alternative viewpoint that it was a tactic to drive support for Jackson in the North.",1648771361

It felt different to be back together than it was the first time. But despite the different feelings it still felt really good, like coming back home. Restarting something that shouldn't have ended.

 If it felt like that second date every time I saw him it wouldn't work, but giving myself time to become adjusted to the new feelings helped me appreciate what the relationship is now and can potentially be.

Glad to hear you're getting the help that you need through therapy. It's great that you have seen improvements on your self esteem even though you've recently just started, that's a good sign. Although I agree with the people here in the comments saying to give it time. But also, maybe discuss this with your therapist as well? As you have mentioned yourself, RJ can have a lot of roots and self esteem is just one of them. Maybe discussing this with your therapist can help with finding strategies for you to address the negative feelings you get despite no longer obsessing over the past. It may not necessarily be the self esteem for you but it may be rooted in something that you do not yet realize. From your post, I can tell you're doing great progress and that's something to be proud of for sure! Also, therapy seems to be working out for you, sticking to that will help benefit you more, I would believe. Wish you all the best, take care out there!",1648771362

*****
&gt; Colombo, Sri Lanka - Police in Sri Lanka have imposed a curfew in the country&amp;#039;s capital following clashes with protesters who tried to storm President Gotabaya Rajapaksa&amp;#039;s residence amid a worsening economic crisis that has resulted in 13-hour-long rolling blackouts.

&gt; Videos from the protest site, posted by the News Wire outlet on Facebook, showed a police bus on fire and protesters tending to a man with a bloodied face.

&gt; Following the clashes in Mirihana, protests spread throughout the city, with demonstrators also blocking the main highway from Colombo to Sri Lanka&amp;#039;s second biggest city, Kandy, with burning logs.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I saw some questionable recaps in the comments below towards France and Germany. 

Roughly from the article on France:

They had a radio station/facility that had previously been well documented in a TV piece that the military had invited the hosts for. The French authorities, through what seems like their homeland defence authority, pressured a known French Wiki editor to delete the article, who had nothing to do with it being written. 

-

The article largely seems to use the TV piece  and the editor was threatened with arrest before leaving the office if he didn't comply. It initiated a Streisand effect after a Swiss editor restored it, and was pointed out they should go through their court system if they wanted it classified, which they never did

-

For Germany:

&gt;In one case, Wikipedia.de (an Internet domain run by Wikimedia Deutschland) was prohibited from pointing to the actual Wikipedia content. The court order was a temporary injunction in a case filed by politician Lutz Heilmann over claims regarding his past involvement with the former German Democratic Republic's intelligence service Stasi.",1648771363

But, what I learned too late during that break up has been a godsend for me during this one. The day we broke up, immediately went NC and blocked social media. He reached out and we talked a few times during that first month, but it was a game where he kept trying to get me to agree to be friends in the hope of getting back together someday. That sounded like torture so I said nope, bye. Back to NC. I‚Äôm now ending month 2 since the breakup and I already feel so healed.

We ask that you always check the college admissions office website for questions about a specific college. Good places to start are a college's Common Data Set (CDS), which can be found by googling ""X College Common Data Set,"" or at http://commondatasets.com/index.html, as well as the publicly released class profiles , which can be found by googling ""Y college class profile.""

Note that some colleges do not release Common Data Sets (notably UChicago and Johns Hopkins), and that CDS and class profile data can sometimes appear to be in conflict. This is because class profiles often include admitted student data, while CDS data is drawn from enrolled students.

Also cost wise the reverse isn't terrible.  Under $10,000 all in to buy the replacement first and sell 4 properties after to complete the exchange.  Much cheaper to do traditional but in the current market I don't see how I could coordinate everything doing it the traditional way.

Although in this case the lens hood is likely not the best for that lens. Most hoods are designed with specific lenses in mind as to maximize effectiveness without actually appearing in the corners of the image. 

This lens hood is definitely meant for a rangefinder indicated by the gaps under the hood rim. These gaps are there so you can see ‚Äúthrough‚Äù the lens hood while looking through the viewfinder. Therefore it is most certainly not intended to be used on an FD lens.

This hood may not obstruct the final image at all, but it‚Äôs unlikely to be functioning at maximum effectiveness for the lens. I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend this unless you just happen to have one of these hoods laying around. A hood is better than no hood, but I wouldn‚Äôt specifically seek out this kind of hood to be used on a lens it wasn‚Äôt intended for.",1648771364

&gt; Colombo, Sri Lanka - Police in Sri Lanka have imposed a curfew in the country&amp;#039;s capital following clashes with protesters who tried to storm President Gotabaya Rajapaksa&amp;#039;s residence amid a worsening economic crisis that has resulted in 13-hour-long rolling blackouts.

&gt; Videos from the protest site, posted by the News Wire outlet on Facebook, showed a police bus on fire and protesters tending to a man with a bloodied face.

&gt; Following the clashes in Mirihana, protests spread throughout the city, with demonstrators also blocking the main highway from Colombo to Sri Lanka&amp;#039;s second biggest city, Kandy, with burning logs.

Once I found roundtrip to Mexico City for about $233 - left on a Friday afternoon straight from my office, got a flight around 7pm, got to Mexico City around 3am, took a quick snooze at my hotel and then was up and out by about 9am. Had roughly three full days and then got a flight home leaving late in the evening on Monday, got back at 6am, went straight to my office. Had a great time. Was pretty tired on Tuesday, but it was totally worth it.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","OP also said in a different comment that hes a tradie that has two other employees but is able to take days off whenever the partner needs it. Which is completely unrealistic and in dreamland if you have any friends or family who are tradies. 

This is also reddit, where when you want to tell ""your story"" you always garnish the reality with whatever you need to make the other side look as bad as possible and give yourself the best chance for support. So all posts like this need to be taken with a grain of salt. The truth is always closer to the middle that anyone lets on.

The larger irony being that is OP truly does take days off whenever he wants leaving more work for his other employees in his trade, hes using his right as a boss to set the rules for himself and impacting others working lives.. just like OPs partners bosses are using their right to want people to come into the office.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","No. 1, the DM *is* always right. It's a wide world out there. No matter how many books you've read, the things you know about are only a fraction of the things that exist. An enemy could always have learned a spell you've never seen before, or have drunk some magical steroid you don't know about. Oh, does it give an ability that no PC race or class can duplicate? Huh, that's a bummer. What are you gonna do about it?

But having the authority to do it and wielding it in a way that makes the game more fun are two different things. In my mind it matters a lot whether the NPC has his own resources tracked behind the scenes.

If I cast Force Cage on the boss and he uses some form of legendary resource to break out, I still traded with him. If I try to cast Force Cage and he Counterspells me, well, he still had to take Counterspell rather than something else, so again, tit for tat. My buddy could have countered his counter if we were more prepared. Another good way would be the ""creatures too big to be restrained by this ability instead take X damage from it"" clause that some video games use. 

But if I try to cast Force Cage and it just fizzles, this is a whole lot harder to be a good sport about. I wasted an action and a spell slot, and any other slot I spent on Force Cage is also now dead. Meanwhile the boss lost absolutely nothing. This makes me look weak in front of my friends, and that's just not going to feel good.",1648771367

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","There's a few possible factors, either by themselves or in combination, may explain what happened.

The ladder animation likely plays a significant part, as it detonated just before the animation completed. So the player position data during that transition between ladder and roof (at that stage where you are unable to stop it even if you wanted to) may have confused the damage calculation.

Also what may have played a part was the mine happened to be placed just close enough to the edge of the roof that the trigger area of the mine (an invisible horizontal circle) that it went off a fraction of a second before the animation finished.

Lastly, when calculating the blast radius/shaping, either the game considered you still on the ladder in some odd way while also being on the roof to detonate (since the animation had yet to fully finish). As for the dead body affecting the blast damage, I seem to recall that bodies are factored into to the blast handling, but I am not 100% sure. With the way mines coded, the trigger area check and the blast damage check are two separate scripts, so throw a bit of client/server side sync timing in there along with the other stuff listed above, and it's not out of the realm of possibility that each of them had slightly different position info to work with. 

In any case, that is some fantastic luck, lol.",1648771369

"thetron","t5_2sbx4","There is a facebook page called '[Help Someone Desex Their Pet](https://www.facebook.com/Helpsomeonefixtheirpet/)'.  They regularly post information on the best deals for desexing animals.  Generally, the places to check in Hamilton besides the vets are the rescues and also Wintec Teaching Surgery.  Male cats are cheaper than females - the female surgery is more invasive and takes longer to heal.

They will probably have a new post soon for the month of April, but for March, here's the valid parts of the post for the Hamilton, Waikato area.

&amp;#x200B;

If you don‚Äôt see a desexing deal advertised for your area, we advise you to:

1. check the SPCA website for details of their current Snip n Chips: [https://www.spca.nz/services/is-snip-n-chip-in-my-location?centre=all&amp;keyword=&amp;tag%5B%5D=desexing&amp;pageNum=1](https://www.spca.nz/services/is-snip-n-chip-in-my-location?centre=all&amp;keyword=&amp;tag%5B%5D=desexing&amp;pageNum=1), and
2. phone all the area vets for a cost comparison, as vets do have different prices, and
3. contact your local SPCA centre to discuss desexing options in the area.

**NZ WIDE**Humane Society of New Zealand will pay up to 50% of the cost of desexing a pet, one animal per household for those in genuine hardship, application must be completed [http://humanesociety.org.nz/de-sexing/](http://humanesociety.org.nz/de-sexing/).  NOTE: At present, the Humane Society is not accepting any new applications. Please keep checking their website for updates.

**WAIKATO (I trimmed out Tokoroa, Turangi and Te Aroha)**

**PAWS ‚Äì Pet Animal Welfare Shops** ‚Äì grants for desexing campaigns have been given to the following vets as at the end of January. Cost is $30 for a cat and $80 for a dog, Community Services Card holders only. Please contact the vets directly to check if there are still slots available and to book:

‚Ä¢ Hauraki Vets

‚Ä¢ Anexa Huntly

‚Ä¢ Anexa Te Kauwhata

**Wintec Teaching Surgery (Rotokauri Campus, Hamilton)** ‚Äì Discounted services for Wintec students, Wintec staff, Community Services Card and Gold Card holders and registered animal charity organisations. Cats: male $50, female $90; dogs: male from $120 - $240., female from $200 - $340. They also offer reasonable rates for the general public. Check detailed price list at [https://www.wintec.ac.nz/.../pets-@-wintec-(animal-care](https://www.wintec.ac.nz/.../pets-@-wintec-(animal-care)...

**Waikato Animal Outreach Trust** ‚Äì Aims to assist families and their pets in low socioeconomic areas and at-risk animals due to financial hardship or distress being experienced by the animal‚Äôs owners. No current deals being run by the Trust, but please contact them at [waikatoanimaloutreach@gmail.com](mailto:waikatoanimaloutreach@gmail.com) if you need help as they may be able to advise on low cost desexing options.",1648771370

That said, the game has a lot going for it, and if you enjoy MMOs but want to get into something that lets you breath instead of having to progress through stories or miscellaneous activities in order to unlock content, ESO is certainly a game worth checking out. You get a lot of freedom to build your character the way you want in this game, and to play as you choose. I mean if you want, you can even just play the game as a crafter instead of being a progression focused player. The game rewards exploration quite a bit, and it's a real treat to just get to choose how you play. In short, if you want an MMO that gives you choices, this is the one.",1648771371

&gt; Colombo, Sri Lanka - Police in Sri Lanka have imposed a curfew in the country&amp;#039;s capital following clashes with protesters who tried to storm President Gotabaya Rajapaksa&amp;#039;s residence amid a worsening economic crisis that has resulted in 13-hour-long rolling blackouts.

&gt; Videos from the protest site, posted by the News Wire outlet on Facebook, showed a police bus on fire and protesters tending to a man with a bloodied face.

&gt; Following the clashes in Mirihana, protests spread throughout the city, with demonstrators also blocking the main highway from Colombo to Sri Lanka&amp;#039;s second biggest city, Kandy, with burning logs.

"Animators","t5_2r5va","I highly recommend Capilano University's Commercial Animation program, as well as their 3D program. There is a massive amount of animation work in Vancouver, and those two programs consistently maintain a 95%+ employment rate immediately after graduation. Just about everyone I know that went through the program has been consistently working since grad.

It's very difficult, but if you don't drop out you get good enough to be employed by the end of it.

I believe it's significantly less expensive than Sheridan as well, and you get your own computer and Cintiq throughout the entire program, whereas I've heard you have to share Cintiqs and computers with other students at Sheridan. It's possible this has changed, it's been a while!",1648771372

I did have my line scoped after this most recent cleaning (the company doesn it after every operation) and there's no concerning breaks in the line, just cracks and joints (were clay segments abut) commensurate with the house's age. They did find a noticeable crack at the concrete sewer junction (city's problem, not mine) but that wasn't the source of the roots.

"japanlife","t5_2rg2o","I'm not entirely sure what's in Legend Protein powders (are you referring to the ""be Legend"" brand?) but if you're having digestive issues with protein powders like I did, you can try Dymatize ISO 100. If that's not easily available, you can verify the ingredients on the label and try to ensure that the protein comes from ""whey protein isolate"" not ""concentrate"" or some blend since the processing in isolates yield less lactose, carbs, and fat in the resulting powder. Dymatize goes the extra step in hydrolyzing the protein similar to pre-digesting it for you to further keep it from upsetting your stomach so you can look for a similar process in other powders. Lastly, I'm sure you already look for lactose-free powders.

As for taste, that's really subjective since I happen to really like the taste of Dymatize vanilla but according to reviews, most seem to hate it. At least it mixes well enough with oat milk for me. I'm not really drinking protein powders for taste anyway but if you're really picky about sweeteners, I think Monkfruit is at the top for the ultra health conscious with Stevia next.

Anyway, except when sprinting, most power is generated at the knee joint, via contraction of the quads and hamstrings (which cross two joints). The calves never generate much, while the hip extensors only contribute a lot at high intensities.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","You still seem to think I'm arguing that we shouldn't feel sympathy for Bruce Willis, when of course we should. This really sounds like a personal issue for you. Have you lost someone to Alzheimer's or a related condition recently? If so I'm sorry, but if Willis' acting career isn't relevant, neither is that. It's irritating, because the entire point I'm dancing around is whether we should feel *worse* for Bruce Willis than anyone else diagnosed with aphasia, because he's a famous actor. I'm preemptively saying we shouldn't pretend that everything he's done has been great *because* we feel bad for him and his situation. You think it's irrelevant? Great, it ought to be. That's what I'm saying, but you're too busy reading between the lines and calling me a low-empathy slob to get that far. 

This sort of thing happens every time a famous person dies or has a health-related issue. People who weren't even fans previously come out of the woodwork to defend them, tell you how much they meant to them, tell you exactly what you should feel. I'm tired of things like aphasia or Parkinson's or drug overdoses being discussed only because a famous entertainer got diagnosed with it or died from it, aren't you?

Do I feel bad for Bruce Willis? Of course. It's tragic. But I'll probably never feel as bad for him as I would for someone in my immediate family if they were diagnosed with the same condition. If you think that's callous, you're just not being honest with yourself. 

Well-known actors naturally also have privileges most people don't. They're treated differently by society and have the benefit of being part of our collective cultural memory. Bruce Willis has already been immortalized by movies like ""Die Hard."" We all still have many good Bruce Willis performances to look back on fondly any time we want. We know his name, we know his face, he has a legacy. And that's more than what can be said for most people. 

I feel about as bad as I CAN for him, without really knowing him personally and only casually enjoying a few of his movies.",1648771373

The control you have over the tip is amazing, the button lock is addictive and solid, the DLC shows snail trails but has a nice texture and is very durable. Mines blacked out and it hides wear better than I would have expected. I like the neutral handle shape because it comfortable in every grip.

The 154cm reminds me of spyderco s30v. Quality steel, sharpens easily, holds its edge for a while‚Ä¶.. the thing with the godson is you‚Äôll be sharpening the tip a lot more than the rest of the edge.

""In truth, the raiders landed after we had departed for Skyreach, or else we would have joined our Uncle in his defence of our waters. We only heard what rumours had flowed up the river to Godsgrace from Lemonwood.""

""We're told that's where they landed,"" Manfred added. He was pleasantly surprised by the concern that the Fowler girl showed at this news. Perhaps she was not so useless as she seemed. She showed concern for her realm, at least, and a ken for what questions to ask. ""A few hundred Ironborn raiders, fought off handily by the Dalts. They acquitted themselves well, if the stories are to be believed."" He raised his eyebrows, himself sceptical that a force of Dalts could be useful for much more than building their own self-image, but he would have to see for himself to gauge the truth of it. He felt a little frustrated, in truth, that he was here, acting as a glorified chaperone, while the enemy was assailing his home. 

""A much more mundane matter than it seems,"" Lewyn chuckled, his voice light and disarming, his smile as reassuring as it was infectious. ""A few unruly pirates, easily dispatched. As I said, nothing that we should allow to distract us."" He took a step closer to her, his long, dark hair catching a little in the wind and billowing behind him.",1648771374

"LV426","t5_2s5sk","I'm not talking about likeability so much as believability. It's a challenge to write a horrifying science fiction story - none of us have been in an interstellar spaceship, while we have heard about serial killers, strange noises while sleeping in a cabin, summer camp ghost stories, etc. The functional launching point for that is empathy, and I think that's an element that Alien really succeeded at engendering. Themes about dark sexuality, violence, horror, insignificance, the vastness of space and unknowability of the universe are all present in Alien, but we're exposed to them via very human, very understandable and believable characters. I think that success is predicated on good writing, and it's a reason that 43 years later the movie still holds up as a masterpiece in the critical community.

While I can't speak to its results since I've been doing other workouts as well, I love it! There's never a day where I know I'm going to do Barre Blend and I dread it. In fact, I look forward to the workouts. It's really true what everyone says about Elise - she's so positive and makes me feel good while I'm working out instead of like I have to punish myself. The butt and arm workouts are my favorite - such a burn! I do also do more intense workouts (like legs and butt from 80DO) but I love the Barre workouts. To me, they sort of feel like resistance-based cardio more than anything, so I treat them that way in my routine. They're definitely not easy or boring to me. Highly recommend you give it a try!

Edit to add: I've definitely seen an improvement in my flexibility and mobility that I have to attribute to Barre Blend, since none of the other workouts I do incorporate that as much. The dull knee pain I've felt for a few years is basically gone.",1648771375

So their solution was to get rid of the voter registration and election integrity red tape by calling all of it racist. Nevermind that every civilized country on the planet has those same measure ls in place - it‚Äôs only racist here because the Democrats said so.

"BeachHouse","t5_2ul68","I was there and they were great as always. Also, killer venue, looking forward to seeing more shows there. There really wasn't a bad view in the whole place, short or no lines for drinks, and the crowd seemed respectful. 

They played:
Once Twice Melody, Lazuli, Through Me, Silver Soul, Dark Spring, Pink Funeral, PPP, Only You Know, Take Care, Girl of the Year, Superstar, Lemon Glow,
""An old song that's very dear to us"" (Wherever you Go), Myth, Masquerade, Space Song and New Romance.

And Over and Over for the encore. A pretty perfect set, honestly. Was hoping they'd also play On the Sea, but alas. 

Stray observations - PPP live is a completely different experience and I went from being kind of meh about it to loving it. The live version of Superstar is different (no percussion for the first half) and I somehow like it even more than the album version. 

Victoria didn't use her range as much as the other shows I've seen (Bloom &amp; DC tours) and sounded more muted in general, but they were in top shape musically. The crowd on average is *much* younger now than it used to be, which I think is great even though it makes me feel like a geezer at 37. 

On a personal note, Silver Soul and Take Care hit HARD live. Silver Soul was my introduction to the band/Teen Dream and helped pull me out of the worst depressive rut of my life. This made slowdancing to it with my fiance 12 years later all the more emotional and bittersweet.",1648771376

Have you been able to gain anything since T? I found it bit of a struggle even with muscle (I try to lift on my own time a couple of times a month but work has me lifting 30+ sometimes) I've also had a few more dizzy spells (had that issue pre-T was diagnosed with Vasovagal syncope when I was 16) but I normally am able to control it by eating something.Also when I first got on T my levels were normal at the 3-month mark so we bumped up my dose (i think it was .3ml/wk to .4ml/wk injections) then 6 months still normal (bumped to .5ml/wk) then at 9 months my levels were crazy high and stayed at that same number at 12months (bumped back to .4ml/wk) and finally its at normal level.All blood work comes back normal aside from those times where my T was about 400 over the goal range. And there isn't any history in my family of fainting except for me. Expressed it to Endo,GP, and my mom (sometimes she knows more of my medical history than me) and got asked about what I was eating and how often I was eating, How active work and home life was and concluded to I needed more vitamins and more calories cuz my body burns it up so fast.

Which begs the question- did you have a chalazion or a hordeolum? If it was an external lesion, then the infection itself may have left the scar. There are ways to remove scars- a wedge resection comes to mind- this of course will still leave a scar but will then allow the lashes to be more congruous. Generally lashes take 6-8 weeks to regrow, so it they haven‚Äôt sprouted yet, they likely will not.

The elephant in the room though is why you have lash loss (madarosis)? This could be a sign of something more insidious. Make sure to follow this- if the chalazion/lesion returns- you need a specific biopsy.

Also, me calling this behavior shitty isn't ironic at all. I wasn't saying people with BPD/NPD never display this behavior. I specifically said that assuming someone has a personality disorder just because they have extremely shitty behavior is not good or reasonable at all and leads to the demonization of these disorders.

Some of the stuff you listed isn't even part of the diagnostic criteria for some of these disorders, and from the post alone, OPs boyfriend might not even meet some of the criteria fully even if he does partially. Personality disorders have very specific diagnostic criteria because MANY people display these behaviors to some degree without it being a PD. So yeah, many people display these behaviors without having a personality disorder AT ALL, especially people who have other trauma disorders and co-morbid neurodivergency. You can't say I'm wrong when this is literally fact.

Also, you can be a shitty person and have it not be due to a diagnosis. Sometimes PTSD makes someone shitty, sometimes it doesn't. Same with personality disorders. You can also be an asshole without having a psychiatric disorder.

Obviously, OPs boyfriend has issues, but to assume he has a personality disorder based on the intensity of specific interactions is ignorant, irresponsible, and harmful. People with personality disorders can be abusive, obviously, but you can't reduce a diagnosis to something that's not even part of the diagnostic criteria. Also many people have anger issues, and are impulsive and arrogant without having a personality disorder.",1648771378

Lumon doesn't want severeds to fall asleep at work and dream, because dreams often incorporate our memories and maybe the severance implant struggles to block memories from being accessed when the innie is dreaming. The black goo is a function of the implant to scare/wake up the innie.

Which could be super interesting if this series turns out to be a prison escape story. What if the only way they can get a message to their innies is through dreams? 

That is, maybe their outtie writes themself a note or repeats something over and over or practices lucid dreaming, so that when their innie attempts to fall asleep at work so they can dream, they dream about what their outtie did/repeated the night before, thereby getting a message.

Like, is the black goo just innie Bert dreaming about what his outie does? We did see some black substance under his fingernails. If that was real, then maybe he gardens or was changing his car's oil the night before, and it was simply him having a nightmare.",1648771380

They even lived in the same neighborhood or atleast fairly close from each other from what I remember.

**If he‚Ä¶** | **Then I‚Ä¶**
:--:|:--:
Went Somewhere I didn‚Äôt mention‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd prioritize keeping my eyes on him‚Ä¶ I need to get some good shots of the guy ruining this, just in case the cops get called.
Throws buttons‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ will throw some sand under them. They‚Äôll get caught in anything if not placed specifically, so a little bit of pocket sand won‚Äôt hurt.
Went for the shrubs and arches‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ Can pick them up. Even if there‚Äôs a thousand flowers, the bulbs weigh in from around six to fifty grams, and the stems themselves don‚Äôt weigh much. Using daffodils as an example, a thousand of them would weigh fifty kilograms, with the average trellis weighing three or four, so in total, each arch weighs about a hundred twenty pounds. Given those‚Äôre the heaviest among them, I can pick all of them up, and tap down the buttons while they weigh less than a fraction of that.
Didn‚Äôt make any fuss yet‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be taking pictures with the guests, keeping either him or the musicians in frame, hoping that they‚Äôll spice up a good photo.
Shoots me or the guests‚Ä¶ | Airguns don‚Äôt exactly hit hard, but they‚Äôre distracting as all get-out. If he‚Äôs taking aim for the guests, then I‚Äôll move close enough to get at his guns. They don‚Äôt weigh particularly much, clocking in at just under two and a half pounds‚Ä¶ but the bits on the guns, namely, the tip of the barrel cleaner and the priming hammer can be weighed down. Too bad the thing doesn‚Äôt have a safety latch, that‚Äôd be fun to trip‚Ä¶
Started knocking things down and making a hell of a ruckus‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt have to worry, he‚Äôd be getting dragged off the property for me‚Ä¶ smile for the camera baby.
Changed the tent-tables‚Äô centers of mass‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ Will pop the legs back under them, leaving the stuff on top safe and sound.
What if I‚Äôm totally off-base otherwise? | Well, any of these plans can be swapped for any other, but my head‚Äôs got a way of thinking in one direction. For that I apologize, dear mind-reader.

*Thirty seconds to walk time. I take a stop over at the DJ‚Äôs platform, and check the track.* ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ make sure you play what the grooms want.‚Äù *The DJ gives me a funny look.* ‚ÄúIf that guy passed you a hundo and asked you to play something else, do me a favor and don‚Äôt.‚Äù

*I know that won‚Äôt stop him if it came up, but it‚Äôs enough to let me sleep tonight. I walk the aisle one last time, making sure that there‚Äôs no buttons, and curtail over to the pianist.*

*I check over his equipment, just a surface check for buttons, and ask him a question.* ‚ÄúYou a photogenic guy?‚Äù *He nods, smiling wide.* ‚ÄúGive me your best chords before the grooms get in, I‚Äôll snap a photo.‚Äù

*As soon as his fingers hit the keys, I snap a photo- there‚Äôs T, in the corner of the shot, with a hand under that chin. Posing for your big movie debut, guy?*

[*I cross the aisle one last time, and watch the Grooms flood in.*](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/937092529982148689/959037090161631232/Broken_Down.png?width=900&amp;height=701)

#[Long As I‚Äôve Got My Head on Straight‚Ä¶](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJzw1h5CR-I)

*My eyes are square on T, watching his face for any signs of movement. The slightest hint of bloodlust, the wispiest of smiles‚Ä¶ All I‚Äôm seeing are frowns. Is this man a sad clown? He‚Äôs got the shoes for it, I‚Äôll give him that.*

*The grooms come down the aisle, the music starts playing‚Ä¶ hopefully the DJ got the memo and is sticking to his stuff‚Ä¶*

*I  circle to the front of the chairs to get one good shot of everyone in the room, even good ol‚Äô T, facing down the first groom. They‚Äôll probably appreciate that later‚Ä¶ though, I‚Äôve got to make these a set.*

*From here, I take a second to scan the carpet, just one extra second to make sure there aren‚Äôt any buttons, stains, sand‚Ä¶ anything to ruin an otherwise perfect moment before I head back behind the altar, so as not to disturb the grooms or guests.*

*I shake my head- again with the arches? Again with the shrubs? There‚Äôs classless, then there‚Äôs retreading wasted ground. I grab my face with my free hand and pull down, the classic exasperation made manifest‚Ä¶*

*I roll out from behind the altar- he took a seat by the aisle. He really‚Ä¶ No. he‚Äôs gonna go for his feet, isn‚Äôt he?*

*I line up with the side opposite T, making it look like I‚Äôm making small talk with a guest while those bowling shoes stick out like groundhogs in winter. They won‚Äôt weigh too much more than normal, but making them weigh something, or, better, making the groom‚Äôs shoe weigh something before he gets there is enough.*

*See, I figure if the groom feels something on his foot, like, he can really feel the weight of his shoe, he‚Äôll stop to check it out. Or just look down, and spot T‚Äôs foot, or a series of buttons‚Ä¶ perfect for another photo, but I‚Äôll save it‚Ä¶*

*It won‚Äôt necessarily be enough to change his path or stride, but a little diversion should help me out. If it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôll make for a nice photo.*

*Hey, all‚Äôs fair.*

*Either or, since I‚Äôve made my way back by the pianist, I‚Äôll hit up the security guard again. If the groom‚Äôs been tripped, he‚Äôll probably already be on it. If he hasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd like to know something‚Äôs up. I doubt he‚Äôll move for me, though.*

*I‚Äôll pop into the closest orange tent quick, making sure the grounded table hasn‚Äôt snapped and most of the-*

*A popping sound knocks me out of my daze. It was his airgun, sure- did he bean the groom in the back of the head?*

*I‚Äôm just one guy! On seeing that the table is thankfully still there, I grab a towel and a bottle of water before whipping back around and out. On my immediate right is the guard, still standing there. I hand him the towel quick.* ‚ÄúBuddy, if you could stick this on the blonde one? That‚Äôs uh‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll call it four.‚Äù

*He shakes his head, trying not to take his eyes off the groom.* ‚ÄúFine, but you owe me Big.‚Äù

*I roll behind the seats, back around to the front of the carpet, and take a knee. The towel lands on T right as the grooms come to face each other, with the lens staring straight down the aisle. Pure Harmony between two tents, with both flower arches in shot‚Ä¶*

*I love this job, really I do.*

*Getting that towel off shouldn‚Äôt take- ah, hell. While I was busy with the shot, he shook himself off and tossed more of those buttons down.*

*No big deal. I‚Äôm lucky enough that I caught that- it‚Äôs a little too bad that the straps on his gun are visible from here, but that‚Äôs another story. Before the ring bear starts his walk, I ask for what, I‚Äôm hoping, is my last favor of the night.*

*I take a few steps forward, trying to stay obscured.* ‚ÄúHey buddy, I‚Äôm gonna walk behind the ring bear, it‚Äôll make for better shots.‚Äù

*He gives me a look.* ‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want something?‚Äù 

*Man, just tell me you want something out of me.* ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ just make sure nobody stops me.‚Äù *he shrugs. Long as it doesn‚Äôt impact him or his duties too much, he guesses he‚Äôll- a chair moved.*

*a bunch.*

*Is he scrunching the carpet? No, he‚Äôs trying to block the aisle‚Ä¶*

*Thankfully, the guards know what I‚Äôm doing. As the ring bear steps out, I‚Äôm hunkered down and low, clearing him a path with the camera recording video, every step of the way. Buttons? If they‚Äôre on something specific, people get asked to move so I can press them, no issue. If they‚Äôre off and dragging, same thing, but I take the hit with the thing in my free hand. Sure, it might hurt, but better me than this kid.*

*If T is still sitting in the aisle seat, I‚Äôll break the strap on his gun with one of my pocketed knives, and cut open my bottle of water on the way back to dump it on his pants. His loss for sitting where we‚Äôve already hit him. Meanwhile, my working hand‚Äôs gonna move just enough to follow the ring bear the rest of the way, stopping right at the altar. For safety‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôll make the ring a little lighter, too.*

*With two clicks of a button, to stop the video and take another photo, and the shuffling of a shutter, we‚Äôve got another memory.*

*Do I hear him standing behind me?*",1648771382

If you are not healthy going into a pregnancy you are much more likely to have health issues during pregnancy. If you have high blood pressure you are at risk for a stroke during delivery.  I've seen the stroke once in 40years of working health care. Increased iron intake is often necessary to keep from becoming anemic. The problem is many of these issues are rare in countries with universal health care. If you live in America or other countries  without universal health care you lose more pregnant women or infants than countries  with universal care.

My boyfriend likes getting slapped aswell during sex, it just turns him on. Hes dominating, but when im dominating him, he loves it. I think its just a sex thing for you, unless you know you have ptsd etc but i think its a little overthought. Getting slapped is a kink. Thats fine. People have their own kinks.

"formula1","t5_2qimj","Verstappen was on the left, remained on the left throughout the entire turn, was even on the curbing on the left, and there was contact. 

Hamilton was coming out of the pits on the right, failed to hold his line through the turn, and attempted to straight-line the second half of the chicane which he can't do when Verstappen's car is there.

The notion that Hamilton ""owned"" the corner is ludicrous when he was coming out of the pits, there's absolutely no way for a guy going 200 MPH to be able to judge where exactly he's going to wind up on corner entry with respect to a car accelerating and then braking out of pit lane.

Hamilton was on the right, Verstappen on the left, and they were alongside throughout. Hamilton should have owned the inside to the first half of the chicane (turning right) and Verstappen should have owned the inside on the second half (turning left). Verstappen was pushed so far to the left they were making contact while he was still on the curbing, so it's clearly Hamilton's fault. Just like the one at Jeddah was Stroll's fault - Albon was on the curbing on the inside when they made contact, so it was clear the issue was the car on the outside came over too far.",1648771384

You just finished a lengthy thesis on why that would be horrific for the trophy economy in an earlier post and now you're arguing that when SuperCell does it, it's such a miniscule amount of players that it has no impact?

Do you even know what you are arguing at this point or are you so hellbent on the act of arguing itself that you are willing to make absurd errors in logic just to keep pushing a bad position?

Betrayed and wayward partners are equally welcome.   

**Observers who are not actively part of a reconciling couple are discouraged from commenting.** Everyone is expected to respect the rules and, most importantly, each other.

Please assign yourself a user flair. Instructions [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/flair_instructions)).

RULES

**1. Be respectful**

- Keep comments supportive and constructive.

- Avoid leaving rude, unkind or dismissive comments.

- Keep in mind that infidelity is traumatic and the sub's members are likely struggling with very difficult emotions. Don't make it worse. Offer thoughtful support, not shallow judgments.

- *Repeated or gross violation of this rule will result in a temporary or permanent ban.*

**2. No personal attacks or victim-blaming of any kind**

- Do not demean, attack or insult anyone, even if you disagree with them.

- *Violation of this rule justifies a permanent ban. Zero tolerance.*

**3. No misogyny, misandry, bigotry, racism or other hate speech**

**4. Do not tell someone to just leave the relationship**

- The purpose of this subreddit is to give mutual support and insight amongst people whose goal is saving and improving damaged relationships.

**5. Posts must be directly related to RECONCILIATION**

- Posts by new users about ending relationships are better suited to r/SurvivingInfidelity.

- *Any unrelated posts will be removed.*

Unfortunately it's tough to get the same types of lawn treatments here in Canada that are easily available in the US. 

I'm thinking I will try a combination approach this spring; I'll put down some sulfur soon as well as an application of chelated iron. I was looking at LawnStar CLI, but I'm open to suggestions if you have any experience with other products. I was also surprised that iron wasn't included in the report...it was quite simple and unfortunately there was not an example report that I could find before I bought it.

That said:

First he had universal name recognition and had been around for *years*, that's immensely valuable. But at the same time, he was sort of perfectly situated to constantly stratal two sides of fences:

* He could simultaneously and really claim to be an ""outsider"" that everyone was out to get, an underdog, ""shake things up,"" etc. But also be an ""insider"" aka Hillary Clinton came to his wedding, he had known all these people for years, gave them money, photos of him with everyone, I know how they work, etc.
   * Similarly, ""he's not a politician"" would excuse a lot of behaviour that a professional politician would just get screwed for. 
* Likewise, he could simultaneously be an uber rich F-you billionaire but also a down to earth regular guy. He has golden toilets, buildings with his name on it, super models etc. But, he loves McDonalds, puts ketchup on his steak, talks shit, seems fairly normal ornery uncle.
   * What really highlighted this was elite progressives calling him unsophisticated for *this* stuff‚Äîi.e. the regular people stuff.

Otherwise, he was funny during the debates. Understood most of the media is indistinguishable from the Democratic Party and they are political enemies. Was able to break away from unpopular things like the faux moral lecturing of the Evangelicals or the ""privatize Medicare"" of the Paul Ryans. Most importantly, he had all the right people losing their minds over him.

\[Insert my rant about the 2008 treatment of McCain and the 2012 treatment of Mitt Romney by the media and the Dems and the GOP going to war.\]

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cuando Diana Sacay√°n pens√≥ la ley de cupo laboral trans en provincia de Buenos Aires, se√±al√≥ entonces la importancia de que ni la falta de estudios ni los antecedentes penales pudieran ser un impedimento para el acceso al trabajo en el Estado. Estos dos aspectos fueron fundantes del esp√≠ritu del proyecto, ya que buscaban esculpir los enunciados y art√≠culos de la ley a imagen y semejanza de las trayectorias vitales de quienes se pensaron como principales destinatarias de la misma: no se trataba de hacer encajar cuerpos polimorfos en normas cinceladas para amparar a quienes siempre cuadraron en el estrecho molde de ciudadanos predilectos por el estado colonizador, blanco, heterocisnormativo y capitalista. Se trataba de que las normas fueran hechas en funci√≥n de las necesidades urgentes que reverberaban a gritos de conciencia pol√≠tica nacida de nuestros cuerpos. Cuerpos que, en importante n√∫mero, se han forjado en el sexilio, las detenciones ilegales y las c√°rceles.
&gt; 
&gt; **SIN RESPUESTAS**
&gt; 
&gt; Pero, ¬øcu√°les son las posibilidades y los l√≠mites de una de las leyes m√°s avanzadas mundialmente de discriminaci√≥n positiva, cuando se encuentra enmarcada en un contexto de discriminaci√≥n estructural? La historia que recib√≠ de boca de Antonela la semana pasada me llev√≥ a entrevistar a la abogada Luc√≠a Molina y a Ro, trabajadora de Migraciones, y a partir de lo dialogado entramar las dificultades que advienen a la sanci√≥n del cupo nacional, y sobre qu√© cuerpos especialmente se ciernen.
&gt; 
&gt; Antonela consigui√≥ este a√±o la entrevista que, seg√∫n explica, la dej√≥ m√°s cerca de lo que nunca estuvo de acceder a un trabajo formalizado en cuatro a√±os enteros de vivir en Argentina. A√±os en los que persiste en su deseo de hacer una vida ac√°, pese a tener que restablecerse m√°s de una vez en distintos territorios debido a la gentrificaci√≥n inmobiliaria, a fuerza de trabajo informal, gracias a su conocimiento autodidacta en inform√°tica -vale aclarar, saber escaso en nuestra poblaci√≥n-.
&gt; 
&gt; Su sensaci√≥n de ara√±ar el trabajo con las manos no fue fantas√≠a. Pas√≥ dos entrevistas y le pidieron que env√≠e documentaci√≥n para iniciar el contrato. Se repiti√≥ a s√≠ misma no emocionarse demasiado. Al cabo de dos semanas sin respuesta, supo que su intuici√≥n era cierta: todo se detuvo por un error en la fecha de nacimiento en el certificado de antecedentes expedido por el Registro Nacional de Reincidencia, el cual no permiti√≥ que su tr√°mite de residencia permanente ingresara al Renaper, condici√≥n que Recursos Humanos del ministerio en cuesti√≥n esgrimi√≥ como requisito ineludible. Sus interlocutores procuraron hacerle saber que elles hab√≠an hecho todo y m√°s por ayudarla, ‚Äúque me hab√≠an hecho hasta ahora un favor‚Äù, explica con vehemencia Antonela. Perseverancia mediante, obtuvo el n√∫mero de la normativa en la que se fundaba el rechazo: el decreto 1421/2002.
&gt; 
&gt; **HABITAR EL SUELO ARGENTINO**
&gt; 
&gt; El Decreto, explica Luc√≠a Molina, reglamenta la Ley Marco de Regulaci√≥n del Empleo P√∫blico Nacional (n¬∞25.164). Dicha ley, sienta como un requisito b√°sico de acceso a cargos en la administraci√≥n p√∫blica ‚Äúser argentino nativo, por opci√≥n o naturalizado‚Äù, lo cual funciona como regla general. No obstante esto, el mismo inciso dispone que el Jefe de Gabinete de Ministros podr√° exceptuar del cumplimiento de este requisito mediante fundamentaci√≥n precisa y circunstanciada de la jurisdicci√≥n solicitante. Con lo cual, o sos formalmente argentine, o el Jefe de Gabinete mismo tiene que autorizar fundadamente que se haga una excepci√≥n con tu caso en particular. Ahora bien, el decreto 1421/2002, en la reglamentaci√≥n que hace del art. 4 al respecto de esto, dispone que la solicitud de excepci√≥n al cumplimiento del requisito de nacionalidad deber√° ser solicitada por la m√°xima autoridad de la jurisdicci√≥n u organismo descentralizado. B√°sicamente, el problema est√° en la decisi√≥n de qui√©n tiene autoridad para hacer la excepci√≥n con Antonela, quien al no contar con el tr√°mite de residencia permanente finalizado, hoy por hoy sigue siendo extranjera a√∫n pudiendo comprobar no s√≥lo con la constancia de residencia permanente en tr√°mite, sino con testigos, que vive en este pa√≠s desde hace ya m√°s de cuatro a√±os.
&gt; 
&gt; Es contradictorio que contar con antecedentes penales no resulte un impedimento para acceder al cupo laboral trans, pero que s√≠ lo sea para acceder a la nacionalizaci√≥n que requiere el cupo, dado que casi el 85% del total de la poblaci√≥n trans y travesti detenida son migrantes (N. de R.: as√≠ lo informa el Informe de Perfilamiento: Impacto negativo desproporcionado de la ley 23.737 sobre mujeres trans y travestis privadas de su libertad en las c√°rceles de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, de OTRANS). Contradicci√≥n de esp√≠ritu legal, y de su funci√≥n √©tico-pol√≠tica, que cercena principalmente el derecho de aquellas personas a las que esta ley busc√≥ dar amparo. Mientras que el 91% de la poblaci√≥n trans privada de su libertad en el Servicio Penitenciario Bonaerense lo est√°n por infracciones relacionadas a la Ley de drogas (la mayor√≠a de ellas en causas donde s√≥lo se cuenta con el testimonio policial, tenencia de cantidades que por poca, no indican en s√≠ mismo venta, y sin compradores detenidos en ninguna ocasi√≥n), en el caso de las migrantes el porcentaje se eleva al 100%, sin que exista ning√∫n otro grupo poblacional preso en su totalidad bajo la misma calificaci√≥n (N. de R.: Informe Situaci√≥n de los derechos humanos de las travestis y trans en Argentina de la CEDAW 2015). As√≠ mismo, entre el 2017 y 2018 la poblaci√≥n trans y travesti privada de su libertad creci√≥ un 36%.
&gt; 
&gt; **ESTIGMAS Y** **CONTRADICCIONES**
&gt; 
&gt; La contradicci√≥n no es s√≥lo con la ley de cupo laboral, nos dice Ro Tosca, trabajadora de la Direcci√≥n de Migraciones en delegaci√≥n La Plata, sino tambi√©n entre las regulaciones migratorias y la ley de identidad de g√©nero, puesto que aunque se trate de un derecho humano, reci√©n cuando obtienen la residencia permanente es posible aplicar la ley argentina para consignar su cambio de nombre y marcador de sexo. Hasta entonces, aparecen con el nombre y sexo registral no deseado. En el caso de las travestis y trans que son extranjeres de Mercosur, el plazo es de dos a√±os. Y en caso de ser extra Mercosur son tres a√±os, por lo que deben pasar todo ese tiempo desamparades del derecho a consignar su verdadero nombre e identidad.
&gt; 
&gt; Ambas leyes, la de identidad y de cupo, requieren poseer ya el documento permanente, y a√∫n m√°s, la de cupo pide la nacionalizaci√≥n, lo que implica pasar por tribunales. Es all√≠ donde les deben naturalizar argentines. Con esto, muches pierden su nacionalidad de origen, algo que no siempre desean. Si se les encuentra un antecedente, ya no se pueden radicar. En tanto no se encuentre el expediente y se determine judicialmente su participaci√≥n o no en un il√≠cito, se prolonga considerablemente el plazo originalmente establecido de dos a tres a√±os previos a poder solicitar la permanente. Y en muchos casos sus expedientes tienen menci√≥n a un il√≠cito s√≥lo por haber sido nombradas en la realizaci√≥n de un operativo en la zona roja por la cual siquiera fueron detenidas.

It is stressful, and it can be hard to see the end at times, especially when time itself feels all warped and you feel like you're repeating the same day constantly. Find something positive to look forward to each day, though - could be meal time, could be working out - and just use that one thing to remind you that in just an hour or two you'll be done with whatever crappy thing you're stressing out over and will instead be doing that one thing you actually kind of enjoy. 

Normally the only people who outright *fail* are the ones who suffer some serious medical injury, or who got caught lying on enlistment paperwork, or who confessed to lying on enlistment paperwork so they can get out, or who just intentionally give up somehow else (like one guy I knew who just crawled around on the track instead of running during PT). 

It *is* possible you'll get sent back (called ""getting ASMO'd""). I don't know how common that is. In my division, no one got that.

I felt confident and prepared (thanks to your article) and we had rapport and spoke for the full hour allotment of time. I was asked back on the spot and we set up the next interview within a week.

Second interview come up about another week later but was also postponed last minute due to another emergency. The guy I interviewed with explained that it was involved with securing funding, which directly relates to this role. There are two others at this interview and when they introduce themselves and their title they mused about holding multiple titles -- I get the impression that they just got funded and need to fill this role quickly. 

So second interview I was far less confident namely because I had an emergency at work myself and wasn't able to mentally prepare beforehand. I did slightly explain that, but I'm not sure how well I got it across. The first interviewer was a new woman. I stumbled over my words and didn't hold great eye contact at times. The questions posed weren't too hard and I got through them but I was far from well spoken. I did begin to loosen up when the guy from the first interview took over. He asked a couple lob balls then asked if I had questions. I asked a few about clarifying the role, expectations, who hires the team, etc. 

Then the third woman, who didn't speak outside of introducing herself, says she has no questions. They said they would make a decision and ""let me know soon."" The whole thing was 18 minutes, but the calendar invite was for 60. 

So I don't know what to make of it. I'm not sure if the whole thing is weird or if I'm over thinking it. Did I bomb it? 

And more importantly - should I address it in a follow up email? Like, should I just a standard ""thanks for taking the time blah blah blah?"" I'd like to say that I'd like to further clarify anything they're unsure of but I don't know how to do that without spotlighting the negative aspects of the second interview. What do you think?",1648771386

I suggest you try 3500k since you‚Äôre interested in warmer tints. Going lower that 3500 is more specialized (and dedicated to bedtime use in my case) and since you mentioned EDC, I‚Äôd go with something more versatile. 3500k is where it starts to actually look a bit orange, but the eyes adapt fast. 2700k looks a bit strange during the day, but 3500k is acceptable (still noticeably warm). At night it‚Äôs going to be very pleasing too, you‚Äôre eyes will see it as white fast. 2700k too, bet never totally, and it can take a minute if you come from a cold lighting environment. 

You can also choose a tint ramping 2700k +4500k but they do have some dowsides: lowest level is much brighter, there will be tiny blue and orange shadows because of the different color leds on at the same time. Advantage is you can choose the color temperature. Also, the mid ramp, close to 3500k, will have a nice rosy tint that is appreciated by most enthusiasts, although some like less rosy than others.",1648771386

As for SMTV, everything about the game is great, but I do echo the sentiment that the story leaves much to be desired - I like to think the game was more just them trying to test out/explore the possibilities of the franchise structured with a new engine, but they neglected the writing because of it; I *do* think there are some parts of the writing that are pretty cool/well-written, the subquests are interesting, but the writing as a whole is, again, not too great.",1648771387

"MLBTheShow","t5_2tjde","investing in the traditional sense might be dead but that‚Äôs not horrible (unless you lived and died with it). leas people hitting on investments means leas stubs in the market and that means lower prices and YOUR stubs go further. it will balance out. 

the real question is if the new QS values are also the new minimum prices in the market. that will have waaaaay more impact. 

if so, the gold market will be dirt cheap because the lower golds can sell for half their ‚Äúold‚Äù value and I don‚Äôt think the higher golds will sell for that much more. 

same with low diamonds. and the higher diamonds are too far away from quick sell value to be effected. overall cost of collections would go down dramatically. 

of course, these could be ONLY quick sell values and not change the market cost. but in the past, if you tried to sell for below the message was ‚Äúyou cannot sell for less than the QUICK SELL value‚Äù",1648771387

&gt;Here‚Äôs the guy who organized the union drive talking about how you left them high and dry. These are your constituents and you couldn‚Äôt be bothered to show up until they‚Äôre on the cusp of victory.

https://twitter.com/krystalball/status/1509653502951366660?s=21

&gt;The warehouse isn‚Äôt in my district and maybe you should look at a map before claiming so. One scheduling conflict aside, we have requested oversight investigations into Amazon, met with Amazon workers in the Woodside warehouses, and more. Hope you do more due diligence next time.

https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1509655301691256832?s=21

&gt;I was told by workers that your folks told them at last minute it was a security issue--not a scheduling conflict. Whether ur district or not, you would think a NY Congressman could've tweeted support--particularly in final weeks--for one of the most important union drives in U.S

https://twitter.com/jordanchariton/status/1509661291308363776?s=21

&gt;Security was an issue as well. 2021 included a lot of high level threats on my life, which limited what activities I was able to do, especially those outside. The combination of that + when we are able to get resources/time to secure them creates scheduling + logistical conflicts

https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1509662528342745088?s=21

&gt;With respect, there's no security concerns with sending out support to @amazonlabor trying to win the first unionized Amazon to 13 million followers. Your voice and organizing power makes a difference.

https://twitter.com/jordanchariton/status/1509663428620734481?s=21

&gt;Not 1 member of the squad showed up. They all ghosted Chris. &amp; this wasn‚Äôt just another event. It was the most substantial worker led organizing effort at one of the most powerful companies in the world. They all had excuses? For all the many months of this organizing drive?

https://twitter.com/krystalball/status/1509659796928086018?s=21

&gt;So what exactly is the insinuation here? That we are secretly in the tank for Amazon? That we‚Äôre ‚Äúsellouts‚Äù despite leading congressional investigations into Amazon, taking huge blowback to call out the scam HQ2 deal, meeting with workers in our district warehouses? It‚Äôs reaching

https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1509661182197649416?s=21

&gt;You‚Äôll have to say for yourself why you didn‚Äôt even tweet out your support. I have no way to know. You gonna reply to @Shut_downAmazon? I‚Äôd say his view matters a lot more than mine

https://twitter.com/krystalball/status/1509670895874359297?s=21

&gt;Smh @AOC that‚Äôs terrible workers from your district definitely commute to Staten Island I know them personally maybe you should do your do diligence

https://twitter.com/shut_downamazon/status/1509659143686217730?s=21

&gt;you know what‚Äôs funny about this situation is that we predicted all of this all of those who‚Äôs doubted us ignored us canceled us not supported us for 11 whole months and if you think none of that went un-noticed you‚Äôre sadly mistaken you should feel bad that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm a say

Wrist Elbow Follow through.

Wrist - Snapped back behind the ball for early hand preparation

Elbow - kept close to the body for good alignments and upon release having the elbow finish above eye level for optimal ark

Follow through - having the index and middle finger in the centre of the ball and allowing those last two fingers to roll off the ball when you shoot. This will provide further accuracy when shooting.

I've actually posted a video on my reddit page called - How You Pass = How You Shoot which should be of value to you.

"fnaftheories","t5_36f29","""Not until I undo what he has done and heal this wound - a wound first inflicted on me, but then one that I let bleed out to cause all of this.""

Considering FNAF 6 is supposed to be the end of literally everything in the series, not just William's killing spree but also Fazbear Entertainment as a whole, taking place at the same location as the Security Puppet minigame. It stands to reason that that when someone says the problems affected them first it would mean that it did affect them first. It would be easy for Scott to change this line to something like.

""Not until I heal this wound - a wound caused by my creations, but then one that he widened further causing it to bleed more and more.""

That would make it clear that it was one of Henry's creations that started it all and that ""he"" caused more problems after that creation caused problems. This was a game made to answer questions, it was made with the specific purpose of leaving everything answered, it wouldn't say something happened first if it didn't.

Also, the security point makes no sense because people amp up security for no reason all the time. There's a reason there's a market out there for at home security devices. No one is after these people but they get it for the feeling of being safe. This is also a children's place, it would be reassuring to a parent trying to take their kids somewhere that the place they chose is focused on protecting their child as much as they are.

It's interesting how the MSM can get people to think a certain way if they push it hard enough.  I was in the #1 ranked fantasy baseball league on the planet one season - 2005 to be exact.  That league featured the 2005 #1 ranked fantasy baseball player in the world and the 2004 #1 ranked fantasy baseball player in the world.  They actually met in the playoffs with the 2004 guy winning.  And this was an AL only league, 14 teams.  10 fantasy managers, full size rosters.

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","You're using 'confirmation bias' incorrectly in your comments here. Since nobody is wondering whether or not everyone (or many people, or even a good number of people) can easily become a pro from Diamond rank when they start to focus up on it, it isn't confirmation bias for us to bring up this example of ONE Diamond player making it to pros.

The original comment seemed to be arguing that Post OP was not being realistic about how hard it was to go from Diamond to Pro, which doesn't seem supported by anything OP said. Therefore, it seems appropriate to show a single story of someone becoming a pro from Diamond, because we don't know anything more about OP than... he is Diamond, and he is considering trying to go pro.

uoefo is saying something like ""It's so funny how so many amateur car racers think they'll go pro"", but Post OP revealed nothing about who he was as a player beyond ""I currently compete in local races sometimes"". Why does it feel incorrect to you for us to say ""Hey look at this guy who went from local races to the pros""?

Confirmation bias would be like, Post OP saying ""I'm an amateur car racer and I know someone who used to race the same races I take part in has gone pro. I am gonna go pro!""

&gt; I don't think people are trying to shit on his dreams, so much as temper his expectations.

There is a stark difference from providing some well-supported facts about how hard it is to compete at the top level of anything and completely misunderstanding what OP was saying, while making assumptions about how hard he thinks it is or isn't to go pro, and making assumptions about how much time and effort he's already put in to be where he is on the Competitive Ranked ladder in order to conclude ""I think it's FUNNY that OP is being unrealistic and overambitious without paying respect to his own limits"".

We don't have enough information about OPs engagement with the OW product to get where he is on the ladder, and how much room for growth there currently is. It is rude to assume he is being unrealistic, overambitious and isn't paying respect to his own limits because we have NO SENSE OF THAT FROM WHAT OP WROTE one way or the other.

I hope this is clear enough.",1648771389

"stocks","t5_2qjfk","I haven‚Äôt held GME shares for over a year. But this could be big if the short interest is still high. It‚Äôs important to note that the stock split is the form of a dividend. Meaning, shareholders will get the split, *BUT shorts will get NOTHING* since they technically do not own the stock. Issuing in the form of a dividend will put significant pressure on shorts to cover before the split happens. Short squeeze could be on IF short interest is high enough. Hard to know what short interest actually is, since it‚Äôs fairly easy to hide through other stock derivatives if needed



Edit: it gets kind of hairy when you start talking about ‚Äúghost‚Äù shares, but essentially when a stock is shorted, two people ‚Äúown‚Äù the same share, and the individual who is short the stock is on the hook for making both parties whole as if they both owned ‚Äúreal‚Äù shares.

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","&gt;Cyclists should have to pay taxes or get license plates to share the road.

Do bicycles contribute to noise pollution?? Do bicycles contribute to local air pollution?? Are bicycles as equally dangerous to others as compared to cars?? Are bicycles capable of destroying property if mishandled?? Do bicycles wear out the road infrastructure as much as cars do??

There is a reason cars pay all those taxes man.

You can argue there should be more control over bicycles. I agree. Riders should be well equipped and wear helmets and everything. They should be identified and respect traffic rules.

You could also implement more no-riding zones for bicycles on the roads where the speed limit is higher, just as we do with highways. In the name of safety and traffic flow. At the same time, they should invest in more back road circuits for slower vehicles like horses and bicycles and whatnot. So they have an alternative to those roads.

I know Germany has done a marvelous job with that.

Now to be honked at and be intimidated by a lunatic driver at the street where you have a fucking elementary school... Fuck Off!

For every cyclist being Lance Armstrong... You have 10 drivers acting like Dominic Toretto out there.

Which one is worse?? 

As you can see, cars produce and are capable of producing many negative externalities.

Bicycles could pay taxes, but they would pay a fraction cars pay. And rightfully so.",1648771392

But the correlation is due to the actual spending of that money, and the increasing demand for goods and services. Now that the Fed is closing the money faucet, the market doesn't expect continued growth and stock prices are correcting while inflation is still high.

"Pottery","t5_2re38","I took Ceramics I and Ceramics II while I was in college, going for a more academic degree. I nearly tossed my original program out the window to be a full time potter, I loved it so much! BUT, I hung on, finished my degree, and started working. I used the money I made at my day-job to fund my pottery addiction. More classes, then clay, wheels, kilns, tools, glazes and all the fancy things to set up my own space. I've had a really nice, fully functioning pottery studio of my own for over 10 years now, and I could not have afforded the deluxe set up I have without the capital from my day job.

For a while I opened my studio up as a business and honestly I found myself so busy running the business end of things, teaching evening classes, running workshops, invoicing, ordering, cleaning, mixing glazes, maintaining equipment, etc etc, that I barely had time to create or make things just for myself or for enjoyment. I ended up going back to a private/personal studio. So now I work at a job I enjoy and pot in the evenings and weekends, and I am VERY happy with this!

Becoming a full time potter is definitely my retirement plan :)",1648771393

Sure part of it is the target audience, but when the bad guys do eighty percent of your work for you you can at least finish the job and spend the effort to politically destroy them.

"MuzzledScientists","t5_5qtjtz","&gt;A group of volunteer scientists who have provided independent and often blunt advice throughout the COVID-19 pandemic will now be placed under the control of an arms-length government agency.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Public Health Ontario has announced that it is assuming ‚Äúoperation and oversight‚Äù of the Ontario Science Advisory Table, which was previously hosted by the University of Toronto‚Äôs Dalla Lana School of Public Health.**  
&gt;  
&gt;It says that the move, which takes effect April 4, ‚Äúwill create a permanent home for the table which will help bolster its provincial resources and ensure it can continue its strong connections with the broader academic community.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The 35-member science advisory table was formed in July 2020 and has consistently provided the Ford government with advice on its handling of the pandemic, as well as modelling.  
&gt;  
&gt;The table has also produced reports on a myriad of pandemic-related issues, ranging from vaccine strategies to how to use rapid antigen tests most effectively.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The decision to fold the table into Public Health Ontario comes just days after departing scientific director Dr. Peter Juni told CP24 that Ontario is in the middle of a sixth wave that is largely the result of the province ""throwing caution to the wind,‚Äù particularly with the lifting of its mask mandate.**  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúYou can call it whatever you want, you know; whether it‚Äôs a resurgence of the Omicron wave we had or a sixth wave, the point is really to understand this is not a BA.2 wave,‚Äù Juin said on Tuesday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the release, the science table will continue to be comprised ‚Äúof independent, volunteer and non-partisan experts.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;However, in a statement NDP Health critic France G√©linas accused the Ford government of undermining the table‚Äôs independence.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúThe Science Advisory Table has been instrumental in giving Ontarians a clear picture of where we are in the pandemic without government rhetoric or political spin. Ontarians put their trust in the Science Table to tell us all about forecasts, and what the province needs to do to avoid the worst,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDoug Ford‚Äôs choice to weaken and undermine the Science Table‚Äôs independence has people worried, for good reason.‚Äù

Hopefully this move provides many of those who were previously restricted from speaking publicly with the press with a bit more freedom to do so.",1648771395

The two areas have to work together to get orders written, scheduled for delivery or will call and picked. Yes often the OFA‚Äôs retrieve the orders when customers come to pick them up if they are staged in other aisles of the store but not always.

"UXDesign","t5_2u66g","I'm in a similar situation with a similar tenure at my existing org as I get ready to start applying elsewhere.  The 10 years prior to this work is irrelevant and not worth putting in my portfolio so I find myself in an odd spot relative to what I see in the wild. 

Instead of trying to pick three features to write case studies on, I'm going to take a holistic view of what Company X is, and then take a look at three areas where I made a significant impact.

Preface - Set the groundwork for what's to come by providing a high level view of our users and their needs.  
1. Company X Core Feature - Demonstrates my ability to design a solution around a lot of data, it's very dense, seemingly simple but a lot of hidden complexity.  
2. Onboarding new users - Common challenge all saas products face which is a niche I want to remain in.  I've spent a lot of time building an understanding of our dynamic user base where the breadth of knowledge is broad and the tool is complex, etc  
3. Scaling a design team of one through the use of a design system - demonstrates how I was able to scale myself and save the company money by establishing guidelines and reducing the needs of my skills.

I'm less certain about item 3 at this point, I may go in a different direction because I don't necessarily want to look for a design system role, but I like it because I know many saas orgs will be design teams of one so this helps demonstrate how I can be successful in that scenario. I've also considered adjacent ideas like a deep dive on managing successful handoffs to help demonstrate how I work with devs.  I like this idea because it's not uncommon to interview with devs at some point in the hiring process at many saas orgs.

I would be happy to chat with you more about this and maybe we can help each other flesh out these ideas. I've redacted some of this for privacy reasons but would be happy to talk in detail privately.

Best of luck on the next chapter!",1648771397

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","And in this dystopian world, I agree 100%. case and point being I think homeless people‚Äôs dogs are probably the happiest pups out there. They get to be with their human all the time, the person usually puts the dog before themselves, etc etc. like I said, it‚Äôs a case by case basis. i believe it is possible to love a dog and give it a good home if you don‚Äôt have the means for super expensive surgeries. But when you get a pom specifically, those are very expensive dogs that are extremely prone to medical issues. I think, in general, it‚Äôs better to leave the poms to the people who can take care of the extreme medical bills. They clearly know the dogs come with issues- as they say they will all likely end up costing $10k+. Why would you get them if you *know* you can‚Äôt afford their health issues, or are unwilling to pay for the issues? Am I saying it makes you a horrible person to own a pom if you can‚Äôt afford a $10k surgery on a whim? Absolutely not. But- they should‚Äôve been prepped for that possibly before getting the dog, and it is totally fair for their spouse to want to discuss it and have a differing opinion. In fact, i think they should‚Äôve had this chat BEORE getting the dogs. Sometimes you just can‚Äôt afford a surgery, and that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs too late, they‚Äôve already got the dog! I would feel like an awful person if I had to put my dog down- but sometimes you have to because the surgery is too much, and I think that‚Äôs 100% fine if you‚Äôve given them a lovely life before that. the dog will still view you as the world and the person who gave them everything. But in general, it‚Äôs not a good idea to get an animal you *know* has medical issues if you‚Äôre not prepared to deal with them. That‚Äôs why you only (usually) see pure bred poodles with people who are comfortable in their money. They are expensive dogs with expensive health issues, that they are willing to take care of. Poms are very similar. All in all, I think if you do your best to give the dog a good life before the health issues come on, I can‚Äôt say you‚Äôre a bad person. They‚Äôre doing their best and that‚Äôs all they can give. 

My original comment may have seemed standoffish or rude- but that‚Äôs not my intention. I myself can say I‚Äôve made the mistake of owning animals with vet bills I can‚Äôt take care of (ex: my Guinea pig. I probably couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for surgery if he gets tumors, and that will be the worst day of my life. But I‚Äôve already got him, and I‚Äôm giving him a better life than his old owner did, and I think that‚Äôs okay. I will make sure he lives his life in comfort no matter what. And if that means I end up having to put him down if something happens, that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs better than letting him suffer.) I think this was extremely rambly but Reddit has a tendency to make me fully consider my stances on things, especially with the help of people like you, willing to oppose my opinions. It‚Äôs such a complicated subject and I think it‚Äôs important to think about for yourself, and also talk about with partners (pre-pet, ideally).

"type2diabetes","t5_2y8sc","Keto.

Breakfast I usually have something egg-based.  Omelet with any variety of toppings, or scrambled eggs and bacon.  Lately, I've taken to having a breakfast sandwich consisting of egg, cheese, and sausage on a zero-carb bagel.

Lunch I'll have something like a burger (no bun, either no sugar ketchup or none) and a salad.  Sometimes kielbasa and cheese.  Occasionally a bit of fruit, like a few blueberries.  If I have a big breakfast, like the one I had today, I might just get some zero-carb  yogurt instead.  Sometimes a taco on a zero-carb or low-carb wrap.  If I haven't had any other ""artificial"" keto breads, I might even have a sandwich with some sliced meat and cheese.  Or a patty melt, since the zero-carb bread tastes better toasted.  These both pair well with a salad, like the burger.  Or steamed broccoli, if I feel like ""cooking.""

Dinner is a wide variety of stuff.  Just had baramundi (it's a fish) sauted, in lemon-butter sauce, with green beans and toasted almond slices on the side.  The night before was sausage and peppers, served over a sherataki based noodle (zero carb.)  I think my favorite is a chicken mozerella recipe that I serve with brussel sprouts cooked in bacon grease (with some bacon thrown in.)  Ginger pulled pork is great.  Meatloaf made with keto bread crumbs too (though I limit myself to one keto bread product a day.)  Chicken caeser salad (hold the crutons.)  Grilled steak.  Sides are any sort of green vegetable, unless I've already got bell pepper and a little onion in the meal.

Snacks, if I eat them, are string cheese, dry-roasted edamame, no-carb yogurt, a small salad, or whatever strange keto-substitute frankenfood snack my wife has ordered and wants me to try.

Dessert is a small scoop of Lilly's no sugar added dark chocolate chips (because I love my chocolate) or Rebel mint chocolate chip ice cream.  Unless my wife has made sugar-free cheesecake or something similar; but that's usually a special treat.

They had overseen a Queensland under-18 team playing in the girls‚Äô national carnival and established senior women‚Äôs academies.*

*‚ÄúWe were getting ready for the national league to start,‚Äù Starcevich recalled. ‚ÄúHalfway through 2016, part of our job was to present to the Suns and Lions and see which one of them wanted a licence to join the AFLW. The Suns indicated they weren‚Äôt ready for it at the time; the Lions jumped at it straight away.‚Äù*

I absolutely agree that the way feminists shame men for being upset is extremely revealing. It shows to me that, deep down, they're not progressives, but *regressive traditionalists*, complete with the expectation that boys and men ""be a man"" and take abuse from a woman with no push-back.

Maybe OP hasn‚Äôt been keeping check on the fish‚Äôs behavior beforehand? IDK. I wasn‚Äôt there and I‚Äôm no expert so it‚Äôs hard to say.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","My advice regarding that situation would be to run RAW but not make a big deal out of it. If they do something anti-RAW, you don't have to say 'the rules say blah', you can just work the attempt failing into your narrative.

Something to keep in mind with wanting to run PF RAW is that there are a lot of written rules and even people who have played since 2008 can still learn new parts of the rules from the core rule book (see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/tt2mc8/paladin_idea_curse_of_the_ancient_one/) for an example of that from earlier today, even).

"Kairosoft","t5_2t4c3","Whatever you carry over will have its upgrades carry over.

So there are 2 ways to go about it.

If you think you will replay this game several times pick things that are easy to build the first time, like say the starting car that you may have upgraded a few times already, and tires. Theres a good chance you havent optimized the upgrades and thats fine. This will help you have a small leg up in the new game, where you can focus on upgrading the part and car you do want to carry over next time.

How does upgrading work? Well your drivers get auras. These auras affect your upgrade bonus. Best aura = best bonus. An engine fully upgraded with the best aura will be much better than one upgraded without.

Keep in mind your carry overs are locked in when you got that message. You can keep playing but you wont get any changes made beyond that point.

Auras also stack, meaning they get better if you dont use them but i dont know the conditions for it.",1648771401
