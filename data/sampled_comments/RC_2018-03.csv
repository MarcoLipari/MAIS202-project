* In the Pac-12, the non-CA schools want to play as many games as possible in California

* UCLA and Cal will never in a million years let SDSU or Fresno State or any other Cal State school into the Pac-12 (which kind of saddens me, I like SDSU)

* There are few good options for P12 expansion that doesn't involve Texas or Oklahoma (which honestly don't fit anyway and I don't want them). Maybe BYU, Colorado State, or UNLV??

* San Diego lost the Chargers so there is a relatively untapped market

* San Diego residents hate LA, so it's hard to count them in the UCLA or USC market.

* UCSD is an absolutely amazing location that could draw recruits.

If you want to stop I'd recommend switching drinking with weed. Weed is like 20x easier to quit cold turkey and it's easier to switch addictions than to stop altogether.

For me it wasn't necessarily the alcohol I was addicted to, it was needing something to look forward to. Work becomes bearable because you have a reward waiting for you every night, and that reward motivates you.

Ideally you go from alcohol to weed to finding something fulfilling that you can look forward to outside of substance abuse. That last step is obviously the trickiest.

The orthodox answer is that He is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, good, and the being from which all existence emanates.  This also describes the God of the Jews and Muslims.  The being they worship appears to have the same fundamental nature, they disagree with us on particular aspects of the divine however.  In other words, they're a kind of heretic.  

If you proceed to deny that the Muslims worship the same God as us because of their denial of Christ's divinity, this being a sine qua non condition of the divine, then you must proceed to assert the same thing about the Jews whose conception of God is closer to Islam than to Christianity.  However, the Jews worship God as he revealed himself to His people in the old covenant.

Katakana is also used together with hiragana to make words stand out or for english words. These two writing styles dominate writing in japan.

"kpop","t5_2r1ox","So their musical identity is basically f(x) and SNSD? Uhm???

I know that today's artists will influence the next generation, as it has always done, but, SM has like, 100% creative control of Red Velvet (which is normal ofc) so the influence argument can't be used for that one - or if you're influenced by yourself I guess lol. 

So they're taking the identities of two other groups, combining them into one, to get what? A machine that can do anything. Because ofc, huge props to the Red Velvet members for showing up big every comeback, they're versatile, but I would still argue that their musical identity doesn't exist. 

It's fine to do a 180 every comeback, but like, you can't identify who you're listening to until you see the title, the visuals or ofc know the identities of the people behind the vocals. 

Imagine if Coca Cola made a new bottle, with a new variation of their logo, design and so on, 2-3 times a year? Would they still sell as well? (Probably because it's fking Coca Cola, but you get the argument) Or is it in general a great idea to have one logo design and red colours? 

It's nothing personal towards the members of Red Velvet at all, they're probably the most talented and entertaining idols at the moment. It's more a critique of SM. 

Btw i've listened to kpop since early January 2014, not because I can see the relevancy of that information in this, but yeah. 

But if you still disagree, then explain to me why it's a delusional opinion, why it's wrong that they don't have a musical identity and why i'm wrong in, that I think they're identity-less musically for doing 180 comebacks all the time.

If you don't bother, and think I'm just a troll, then it's fine. I accept that, but I would just find it hilarious how you say that Twice doesn't vary, but are in full denial of Red Velvet doing the same, in just another way.

Player decided he wanted to jump 15 feet across the moat onto a damp surface of just rock...  There were also massive amounts of crocodiles/alligators in the moat.  But there was an entrance way across the moat and he really wanted to jump!  Told the player it wasn't a smart choice, more than I am willing to say.  He made the jump though!  Even hung on!  But, trying to shimmy across 15 feet to the entrance, he lost his grip...  Guess what, I didn't take away the horde of crocodiles...  He was ripped to shreds but a NPC ""saved"" him.  Roll from table of random things that suck when you are revived from an evil character and he now loved the taste of rotting and fetid meat...  Know what my player did?  He laughed his ass off and we all kept playing with him having a new RP element...

Based on my experience, if you are running the stock flight control (i.e. 1F; 1TB; 2DB) I would advise grouping your DBs to try and cause multiple fires on enemy ships - particularly Battleships.

Reason being, if a Battleship is burning in multiple locations, her captain has to make a choice:

* Option A - Let the fires burn and lose considerable health to the fires (noting the fire damage can be healed 100% by the repair consumable)
* Option B - Put out the fires using the Damage Control consumable to conserve health

Either way it is technically a win-win; especially if Option B occurs as you can then try to score a flood on your target with your TB squadron. If you score a flood when the Battleship does not have their Damage Control consumable available, a single flood can cause huge amounts of damage over time (up to 60% of the ship's base health pool according to the WoWs Wikipedia).

You can pursue the same approach with the upgraded Flight Control (i.e. 1F; 2TB; 1DB), but keep in mind you have less DBs to work with in this instance.

I hope that helps. :)",1519862408

But, I was headed somewhere with a couple friends and we were running late, so we started walking again.  

Sometimes when you have a moment like that, you might never see her again and always wonder - if I had just had the courage to walk over and say hi...  Luckily for me I saw her again later and this time I talked to her.  We had a thing, for a while, then it was surprisingly easy for me to break up with her - I guess we had never really connected and she had just used me to try and make an ex-boyfriend jealous.  It sure is better to have had a thing with her, rather than have always regretted not, for the rest of my life, because I surely would have.

I can always think back, and what I think is this: holy fuck, she was so god damned hot, and yet, not regret that we broke up.  If only ever boy could be so lucky as to have a memory like that...",1519862408

Look at your friends list, you'll find people still rolling out legends on their 5 star form sometimes because they do want to test it out first before knowing how to build them, what sockets to use and etc. If you suddenly find people with 200cc, max lv and max socket, it means they have been keeping dupes in preparation.

Sean Moon (the pastor of this church, ""World Peace and Unification Sanctuary"" in Newfoundland, PA) wants you to know that it wasn't. It was guns. Guns were the *center* of Jesus's message, according to Moon.

In the video below you may be able to tell that he is wearing a crown of bullets.

6:22 ""The CENTER of the Kingdom of God is the crown, land ownership, and GUNS, the AR-15 assault rifle, the rod of iron."" 
7:25 ""Gun owners are the true Christians."" 
7:38 ""They are the ones who are the center of the Kingdom of GOD, not these moral posturing little prima donna glitter-bug ministers who just like preaching about love, but never about the rod of IRON! [fist pound on table]. You say, oh yes, we support gun ownership because it's a constitutional right of America, and they serve a utilitarian purpose if we get attacked. No, you pieces of trash, you stupid idiots, It's the CENTER of Christianity. It's the CENTER of Jesus's own vision for his kingdom."" 
8:48 ""God has revealed the true christians in these last days... They are the ones who--maybe not even go to church--but hold fast to their guns, they know spiritually, something in their soul, calls them to it.""

Korres Wild Rose Advanced Brightening Sleeping Facial (Allure) – I love love love this. Love it. This is from one of the fall Allure boxes. I started using this and didn’t think much of it, and then I switched to something else for a week and something about my face was just off. This really does brighten my face, and my new skin was restored quickly when I started using it again. It has a pleasant smell, isn’t too heavy, but is a smidge greasy. I ended up with two of these from Allure, and went and found a few more cheap on eBay, and once I work through all of these I will probably purchase the full size version. I think the sample version is half the size of the regular one, and this seemed to last me quite a while. I was GENEROUSLY throwing it on my face before I realized how magical it was, and then started using it sparingly.
 
Origins Retexturizing mask with Rose Clay (Influenster) – I received this mask with a serum/moisturizer (should finish these in March). This mask was good. It does have a strong smell, but I liked it, it was refreshing and rosey. I enjoyed the pink esthetic among this – the package is pink and so is the product. It is also gritty. It was a good mask to receive for free, but not one I would probably purchase.
 
Tarte Empowered hybrid gel foundation (Tarte bi-annual box) – This isn’t from a monthly box, but from the Tarte Make Your Own Box promotion (they did it twice in 2018). This came out to like $7 or something. ANYWAYS. This is another HG for me. I really love this foundation, it’s a light-medium coverage and blends into my skin well. It’s a nice dewy finish. I’ve seen a lot of complaints about the packaging, but I’m a garbage person and it didn’t bother me to dig into a tub instead of a pump package. I would pay full price for this if I ever run out of foundation/BB creams, but I always seem to have a backlog of it, and for a couple extra $$ I can buy this during their build your kit sale, so I haven’t needed to just full on buy this yet.
 
Lancome Monsieur Big Mascara – I don’t remember which box this was from. Play? Allure? Ipsy? It doesn’t matter. I used this for a few weeks, it got really clumpy and dry and I put it in my “finished” drawer. A lot of it ended up under my eyes by the end of the day. Wouldn’t purchase this.
 
Vichy Mineral Serum – I think this is from Allure? This serum was fine. It didn’t have a smell. It seemed to do its job but wasn’t standout. I have another one of these that I will use, probably wouldn’t purchase this.
 
Various perfume samples – I love perfume samples. I have no need to purchase an actual bottle because I have so many samples (Thanx Sephora!).",1519862411

The Kamoshida stuff is obviously intentionally gross, and her outfit is supposed to be empowering within the story (all of their metaverse outfits are meant to be their image of rebellion, and Ann's is about embracing your sexuality within a conservative society), but whether you'll take it like that or think it's an issue with the devs is up to you.

Other than that, Morgana continues to have a crush on her and be cringey about it, but I don't think he ever says anything sexual about her, and there's one or two comedy scenes with Ryuji where she teases him and laughs it off.

Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.

Libertarian socialism also rejects the state itself, is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization. It asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions and workers' councils.

#The Mission of our group

we strive to create a **""United Front""** for all small Youtubers under our banner. It has been hard for small youtubers these days, so we are trying to empower ourselves to have a chance in the platform with the big channels.

Young grasshopper, your submission might take days or even months to be featured, or even not at all, but be **patient**, young one. Consider yourself as part of the family in our factory, and keep producing good content. But remember, **patience** is key.
 
you should interact with other people on the sub. If you want others to view your content, you should start viewing other's content on this sub, and give constructive feedback to others. If YOU start doing it, then everyone else will. A little droplet DOES make a difference.

#IF YOU DON'T STAY SUBSCRIBED TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL, CHANCES ARE THAT YOUR CONTENT WILL NOT GET PROMOTED ON OUR SUBREDDIT.

#are you a subscriber of our youtube channel? If you aren't, subscribe -&gt;[NOW](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClK-180zEL41GC1UjBzJ7og?sub_confirmation=1)&lt;- to increase the chance of getting featured on our subreddit, youtube channel and twitter!

Also, commenting on our [latest video](https://ltstyt.be/@industrialized) increases your chance of getting picked. If a new video came out, comments on old videos don't count.

Uh, I'm level 352 in Dokkan and only have 150 stamina. In OPTC I think I had that much stamina at around level 260.

Personally I've played OPTC for a much shorter amount of time and ranked up a ton, and while you do use more gems for stamina refills it's because there's actually stuff to farm and do compared to Dokkan.

I do think the raids costing 60 stamina seem a bit high for the xp you get, but it's not all that bad.",1519862414
"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","Eh I never bought Austin being very smart so we have to disagree on that respectfully.

He is just overly book read that could speak in a way that sounds well, but if you listen to what he actually says half of it was empty and devoid of all content.  Or often just downright dishonest but pretending he knew what he was talking about.  Gosh when he started ranting about basic level economics, like introductory course stuff, as if he was some genius on it only to realize he didn't even understand basic concepts such as economic self interest or supply and demand made me realize that half of his stuff he says is ignorant sophistry that just comes across as intelligent.  I mean I am fine with him not knowing things about economics, but when he acts like he is some genius on it and starts lecturing the people on the podcast about it, and then he clearly has no idea what he is talking about on an even fundamental level where I think surely even he knows he doesn't know... something is off.

To me he was always the guy who seemed more like won a book reading contest whoever reads the most books this summer gets to be a member of GB for a year, and then only wanted to preach politics.  

Don't get me wrong, I think good communication is important and valuable.  I could improve it myself.  But I never saw him as smart.  Being able to quote obscure books and speaking with big words is not what makes a person smart.  His reasoning skills were utter garbage.  This him having a Bachelors in philosophy yet he couldn't even handle basic reason that you would get in a General Logic class from a philosophy department in a university.  

I sound aggressive in this, and I don't mean to be.  Just trying to show why I disagree.  But thats cool :) I mean this is just based on our own perceptions more than anything.  So no biggy !  Please don't take offense.",1519862414

"television","t5_2qh6e","&gt;what would be the difference between highest grossing actors and highest grossing directors?

It is extremely rare that an actor and director work exclusively with each other over the entire course of their careers...

Since you mentioned Titanic, we can look at James Cameron. He has 2 of the highest grossing movies of all time with Avatar and Titanic.

A quick google is only giving me 1 actor who was in both of those movies - [some guy I've never heard of called David Warner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001831/)

So Leonardo DiCaprio isn't going to get Avatar added to his total gross, and Sam Worthington isn't going to get Titanic added to his gross.

So you can see how the Highest grossing Director, and Highest grossing Actor will very easily be different.

&gt;Is passenger #458 in Titanic also one of the highest grossing actor

I've never seen a ""highest grossing actors"" list that includes extras, and even cameos are usually excluded (which would knock out Stan). I can see how you could argue that you should technically include cameos, even though I tend to think those lists are a bit silly, but including extras work in there is definitely too much of a stretch.",1519862415

Un 20enne oggi ha molta più scelta e libertà di manovra rispetto al 20enne di 50 anni fa, ma questo provoca anche l’indecisione data dalle troppe scelte possibili. Aggiungi a questo che in Italia si chiede di scegliere quale lavoro svolgere ben prima di averne fatto alcuno, quindi di aver magari sondato cosa piace e cosa no, e fai bingo.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","The trouble with this ""love comes from the inside"" idea is when you *don't know* how to love yourself. People aren't complete, independent lifeforms separate from each other. We are strongly influenced by other people. But most importantly, other people are how we *learn*, not just about how to understand ourselves but how to understand how we fit in with others. So, it's not as simple as saying, ""Love yourself first."" People have to learn how to do that by asking others.

If getting a gym membership to be more attractive to someone who's fit is what gets you to the gym, that should be fine. If you *keep* the gym membership even though you're miserable, that's when I would say it's a problem. But you don't make the leap from feeling unattractive to feeling attractive by telling yourself you're beautiful even though you're unattractive. That's something you work on internally and externally. And that's how the ""love yourself"" bit works. If it was as simple as accepting yourself the way you are, no one would be complaining about getting a date because they'd *know* there's nothing they can do about it. The issue here is someone complaining because they know they can do something about it, they're only expecting that something to be you or me or someone else. And when you say, ""I am attracted to what I'm attracted to,"" you are effectively telling that person that the change can't happen outside of themselves. The only difference in what I'm saying is that I think you go a step further by helping affirm to them that they can change and they can get closer to the things that make them happy, whatever those may be. But let's be clear here: If you want something, don't wait for it to come to you. Do whatever you can to go for it.",1519862416

Sure, but Bush also curbed illegal immigration greatly by enforcing the San Diego fences more. What about Hoover and his hispanic deportations? You didn't respond to that. 

&gt; Also, France before the current migrant crises had millions of North African and African migrants and millions of descdents from those immigrants.

Yes, and the right wing populists of France are growing in numbers as a result. 

&gt; here were also hundreds of thousands of Turks and millions of descdents from Turkish immigrants in Germany,

Sure, but not on the scale recently. Which is why we are seeing more right wing populism in Germany. 

&gt; and the UK had the same case with south asian migrants. There is an ebb in flow to things, eventually, things will calm down, and those right-wing parties will disappear.

Sure, and that is why they voted for Brexit to occur and limit immigration. I don't see how you can say right wing parties will disappear  when literally they are growing in all of these countries.",1519862416

A doctor isn't going to write ""drug user!"" in black marker across your file. It's possible they will make a note if you show blatantly obvious drug seeking behaviour, try to steal their prescription pad etc and even then you can get it removed if it's not true. 

Finally, you can always go to another doctor. They don't get your records automatically from every other doctor in the country (unless you have something like an online, single point medical history thing - and if you have that then it's even easier for you to see what info there is about you - there is no secret doctor-only section. These systems are super expensive and very sensitive to privacy, they exist mainly for the elderly and the chronically ill) 

The exception to all this registers for specific things that track how often a person buys pseudo ephedrine for example. And for them you will be told very clearly what it is, why you need to show ID, etc. 

As someone who is a past drug user who worried a lot about this stuff, let me tell you that the complete pictures of your  health is more important than any bias that a small percentage of shitty health workers might show you - and its just as likely that a shitty worker would find other ways to discriminate anyway, like race, gender, weight etc. The huge huge majority of medical workers a great human beings, there are assholes in every industry.

I believe very strongly I should be able to own weapons that can compete, at a minimum, with what the police have. With that said, it shocked me how easy it was in my state to buy an AK47 variant, a drum magazine, and hundreds of rounds if ammo. I was in the military and grew up shooting guns. I'm very comfortable around them and have been on the receiving end several times while deployed. I don't think you should be able to walk into a store and walk out with what I bought in a matter of 15-20 minutes. I'm 100% okay with having to wait a reasonable amount of time and prove, perhaps through a class, that I can safely handle a weapon with that much power. The average person should not be able to get a rifle like that as quickly and as easily as I was able to. It won't stop people who shouldn't have them from getting them entirely, but I know enough about human behavior to know making it harder, either by waiting or through certification, will deter a lot of people on the edge, which may reduce the overall probability of mass shootings.

I'm so thankful I downloaded Tinder because it made me realize that I am absolutely in no way shape or form ready to start dating again or to put myself out there.

I've recently embarked on trying to lose weight. I'm learning to cook healthy meals for myself and I started doing yoga. I've been reading a lot more lately, watching TV shows that make me laugh and spending time with my family.

It feels freeing that for once in my 30 years of existence, I don't feel the need to have a man in my life to make me feel whole or happy.

- Try to stay away from the Flyfish when it's looking for targets, swimming around underneath it can cause it to face away from the team (or towards the shore) when it's vulnerable.

- Every stage has ideal ""focal points"" for salmonid rush levels, where all four players should ideally be stationed. For the love of Poseidon, if someone is shouting ""This Way"", take their advice.

- If you're the first to see which direction enemies are coming from, call players over.

- A life ring can be invisible in a battleground. If you want revived, shout for help. Don't assume I can see you because you can see me.

- If you get a Scrapper's attention, try to move so that it faces away from the rest of your team. Easy kill.

- Don't guard faraway eggs. The rest of the team will be one player down while they try to deal with the carnage elsewhere.

"acne","t5_2qse3","It worked for me but it took almost the full six months. I had pretty severe cystic acne and very oily skin. The sitting oil on my face is completely gone now and I rarely break out. It's been about 4 years or so since I took isotretinoin. There are a lot of side effects related to the dehydration caused by this drug. As I understand it, Isotretinoin works by promoting cell turnover and stopping oil production. I experienced: extremely dry lips, eyes, eczema on my hands, headaches, mood swings, poor night vision, and joint pain. All of my side effects went away, except I still have moderately dry skin and eyes, but I'm fine with that. You're going to need to drink a ton of water, avoid alcohol, get monthly lab tests, and get monthly pregnancy tests if you're a girl.

We talk about the whole “melting pot” aspect of America as a good thing and yet see cultural appropriation as a bad thing. It’s odd to me. The mixing of cultures should be one of the goals of any leader. The more you understand a culture, the less likely you are to discriminate against them.

Like, I would say that it seems the vast majority of ""nonbinary"" people, or at least the openly visible ones, seem to be gay/bisexual women. It seems to me that a lot of them, at some point, figured out they were gay/bi and then heard of the nonbinary trend and  jumped onboard because of a lot of the attributes that people claimed of it were things they themselves had(""I like doing girly things sometimes, and I like doing manly things sometimes"" yeah, so does pretty much everyone!)

* Try undervolting your cpu with a program like XTU |
[Vid that may help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNP5I2y668)

* Use a program such as throttlestop to disable turbo while gaming, helps with overall temps since the cpu and gpu share the same heatpipes.

* May want to try undervolting your 1060 as well, with a program such as MSI Afterburner, decreasing by 10mV increments, validating with a benchmark like furmark.

* Lastly, might want to limit cpu to something like 80% in advanced power settings in windows.

Wouldn't try re-pasting your laptop if you don't 100% know what you're doing/ worried about voiding your warranty, but re-pasting as well as attaching thermal pads on VRM's may help with the GPU slowing down as they do sometimes get toasty, as well as how OEM paste is kinda wonky sometimes.

It was summer, and my grandfather, grandmother, mom and I were working in the garden. It's pretty big and there is a lot of grass to be mowed and stuff like that. 

After all the work my mom would always ask me to get some soda, because everyone was thirsty from working. It was in the evening, but still pretty warm.

After everyone had their soda, my mom asked me to put it back in the fridge which was in the ""basement"" (used as a living area, only a small part is storage). So I go to the basement, and please note: the room with the fridge is like 20 - 30 sec from the exit, and you have to pass two doors with those flappy anti-fly curtains. 

I put the soda in the fridge, close the fridge and walk out. Seems normal right?

..... except I had to do this three times.

The soda kept reappearing whenever I put it in the fridge and turned my back on it. Everyone was outside, and there was only one bottle of soda in the room. To this day, I am still confused over what happened. There have probably been more moments like this, but this is the one I remember the most.

Edit: tl;dr: my soda kept reappearing after I kept putting it in the fridge three times.

"grammar","t5_2qhwy","&gt; Sentence 1: Should there be a comma after management?
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike classical management which views the organization as an emotionless robot, the human relations perspective see the organization as a human with emotions and needs.

Absolutely: *which view the organization as an emotionless robot* is a supplementary relative clause (often call a nonrestrictive clause). Supplementary clauses, because they add extra information and are not an essential part of the sentence's syntax, are almost always marked on both sides with commas. This is one of those rare cases where a comma is a conventional necessary *and* a grammatical necessity.

&gt; Sentence 2: Should I use create or creates?
&gt; 
&gt; The organization has its sets of values, practices, rules, symbols, and language that ____ creates a unique workplace or climate.

You want *create*. You have another relative clause — this time it's an integrated, or restrictive, relative. *That* relatives contain a gap, and that gap has an anaphoric^(1) relationship with an element elsewhere in the sentence. The gap inherits its number properties from that antecedent. In your sentence, that antecedent could be one of two things: *sets* or *values, practices, rules, symbols, and language*. Either way, the antecedent is plural, which means you want *create*.

^(1) think of the relationship between pronouns and their antecedents",1519862432

**Live audiences** were the original origin of this concept on TV. Shows were taped in front of live audiences who reacted to what was happening live in front of them. Even radio had this psychology ingrained into pop culture as it was often recorded (or played recordings) with live audiences. This often included musical acts, comedy, or variety shows. [The Beatles performing live on Ed Sullivan 1964 is a good but later example of this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jenWdylTtzs) It should be noted that live performances were commonplace way before the Beatles performed. I Love Lucy was recorded in front of a live studio audience (with their live reactions) for the early part of its run starting in 1951.

From there, **recorded laughter** became a way for companies to *sweeten* the live audience reactions if the original recorded reaction wasn't as good as they hoped. Live audiences were often unreliable or tense, so recorded laughs remedied this situation. The Goldbergs was an early example of this in the 1950s, and later shows like [The Andy Griffith Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo10xdN2Rds) and Hogan's Heroes used this method in single camera format.

In today's world, you might record in front of a prepped studio audience who is coached to react in certain ways. However, it's still possible (like in the 1950s) to *sweeten* the reactions if you so choose with pre-recorded laughter.",1519862432

I didn’t completely cut out drinking, I will have one or two in a social event or at dinner but I don’t go out thinking that it’s okay to drink at the minimum a 12 pack every evening. So getting in trouble and realizing that getting completely smashed doesn’t exactly attract the best crowd turned me around. The worst part is trying to figure out how to build intimate relationships that don’t revolve around getting as fucked up as possible, I was in no way an angry drunk but trying to find a way to connect with others that doesn’t involve getting messed up has been somewhat problematic for myself.

"WayfarersPub","t5_3gpno","**Name:** Vixen Nightstar

**Game of Origin:** Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition 

**Appearance:** Vixen is roughly 5 feet 4 inches tall with smokey grey skin that draws the eye even if none of the rest of her features did. Her golden eyes are slitted vertically, like a cat's, and tend to narrow when she is focused on something interesting. Her skin is flawless and impeccable, having never had the chance to be scarred or maimed. Small black horns poke out from her hair, barely curving backward but unmistable and unhideable beneath her raven black hair. Her hair is long and pure black, kept prim and proper. She trims it so that it rests down to the top of her lower back. Behind her, her tail flicks and she likes to run its heart shaped tip along people's arms, or use it as a slightly clumsy third hand. 

She dresses in extravagent layers of clothing that cling to her thin frame, but also don't exactly leave her curves to the imagination. Her overcoat is long and black, trimmed with gold that wraps in on itself in the pattern of flames. Underneath that are robes of shimmering purple silk with designs drawn on it in blues and blacks. The final layer is a suit of thin, light leather armor. Plain browns and lacking any designs on it. All there is, is a hand drawn, eight pointed star in black paint over the left breast area. 

At her hip is a plain looking longsword in a scabbard that's seen better days. Worn and scratched, though impeccably clean. She carries a bag with a shoulder strap, where she keeps most of her more loose things. As well, she carries a staff and several wands along with her. Around her neck, under most of the clothing, she wears a symbol of Mystra that is forged in mithril.

**Personality:** Vixen is an inscrutable person to most people. She moves with the grace of a noble woman, but with an almost habitual flirty smile to her face. She carries herself with the air of a importance, but not arrogance and dismissiveness. She is curious and quick to take interest, and hard to get to give up on something that has piqued her interst. Even so, she is tempermental and a bit flighty. Her attention is hard to keep, and she is easily distracted. 

She has a tendency to enjoy kissing and further things along that route, and often treats it as a way to get to know people. However she understands that it is not so much what people enjoy, and keeps her advances more subtle. Keepig her enjoyments to flirting and light touching. 

For her friends, she is a staunch ally and unyielding in helping them. Whether it be spellcasting, research, or anything else, she'll give her all. When she is convinced and able to focus, she approaches the task with a plan and coffee. Tending to not sleep until her task is complete.

**Desire:** Vixen would love to free her world from the undead plague and scourge that is consuming it. As part of the militia and an arcanist and noble of the land, she sees it as her duty to solve the problem that they let fester and cosume a great part of the continent. Aside from that, she desires to find lost spells and knowledge. To find all the things that the world has to offer, to see all she can and sate her ravenous curiosity. On some level, she would like to one day meet her infernal ancestor, though it is not that important to her consciously. 

**Fear:** Failure and disappointment. She would be abhorred to fulfill her family's worries and shame that they held. What keeps her up at night is the idea of being alone, though she hides it well. She is well versed in solitude, but she enjoys just the simple company of others. Not even romantically. 

**Quirks**

* A bit overly dramatic at times, and more than a bit vain. To the point of refusing to get dirty if she can help it in any way, no matter how inconvient. 
* She has a ravenous appetite for romance novels. Not the good ones, the trashy, smutty, dirty ones. And the good ones too. And really all of them, she doesn't care if they're good. 
* Has, more than once, forgotten that she is not able to rest like the rest of her family. When she tries to meditate rather than sleeping, it can be a bit of a chore to wake her up, and she will eventually fall asleep if left undisturbed long enough. 
* She has a cat named Azera, though the cat looks a lot like her in its fiendish visage. She spends any time she can sleeping as near to any fire she can.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","Well think about it this way, if you didn’t tell her and you went along with it you might’ve done some dumb things while in the relationship. Take it from me, I was depressed and went all in in a relationship. I lost myself in her, it ruined a big part of my life. We’ve broken up since and i’ve lost my identity. 

Sure you can regret not doing it but dating someone while you have depression is hard and its hard for the other party too. Honesty is the best policy in my book. 

The good thing is you havent screwed the possibility of a relationship. You still have the opprotunity to make it work in the future and you can still be honest and talk it out about how you feel. Believe me youre not 100% screwed and since a relationship never happened theres a chance that relationship could happen. Dont give up hope.  ",1519862437

I agree that Tyler is good, but it's not the same as being given CT or Wes, or another top dude. Even Johnny getting Frank in Rivals 2 doesn't measure up to the claim that production is gifting him challenge wins by throwing him op teammates. Don't you dare bring Superboy into this! The man thinks Theo Von is God's gift to The Challenge! 

There are times when you can argue he's been put in far worse situations because of production. In Cutthroat not only were the teams drafted by the worst player, but he was part of the awful heavy hitters twist that screwed him out of a real matchup against Tyler. Invasions he had to go into eliminations against the other Champs instead of the weaker team. Same thing in Gauntlent 3. Vendettas/Dirty 30 consisted of a lot of newer players and an individual format that doesn't benefit him. He was also put on the worse team in Inferno 3.

&gt; Young Princess Sophia of Germany is taken to Russia to marry the half-wit Grand Duke Peter, son of the Empress. The domineering Empress hopes to improve the royal blood line. Sophia doesn't like her husband, but she likes Russia, and is very fond of Russian soldiers. She dutifully produces a son -- of questionable fatherhood, but no one seems to mind that. After the old empress dies, Sophia engineers a coup d'etat with the aid of the military, does away with Peter, and becomes Catherine the Great.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Wow I just checked out the first link on /askphilosophy and it states that Peterson attributes Rousseau and Kant as the beginning of Post Modernism.  This maybe true for Rousseau, but certainly not for Kant.  

As far as I can tell, Peterson pretty much credits Kant's ""Copernican revolution"" idea when he talks about our built-in ""cognitive apparatus"".  This apparatus is part of your evolutionary biology and it helps you pre-process and makes sense of the world.  In fact, if you don't know much about Peterson, this is probably the first thing you hear about him:  when you hear about the ""Lobsters"" and the ""dominance hierarchy"".

&gt;He reflects very poorly on the conservative ideology

Also I'm glad this is the case.  Ideology is exactly the thing he is against.  Anyone who has it all figured out has nothing new to learn.  If I understand Peterson correctly his highest goal is to Learn and strive for self-improvement.  Hence he always explains this whenever he does a lecture or when he wrote his book.  He essentially explained how he saw those as opportunities to learn and expand his knowledge on the topic.",1519862440

I like he draft system still and it is fair unlike Europe, but the system has been figured out. The worst team has highest odds to get number one, easy to figure out to just make your team suck.

On a more serious note, Monogatari is giving my ideas. Vampire ideas. You know, the current issue in my story is that I have no real characters to accompany the main character. You know, like his squad. This is an issue for 2 reasons:

* I can't work with that many interactions which tend to fill the parts of the story when not much really happens. You know, how characters react to each other and random chats they have. Also helps people build bonds towards the characters

* I have less characters to kill. And the squad does get thinner pretty soon, which would make it awkward to have only like 3 characters interact together after only a bit of the story passes. *I guess I like killing my characters a lil too much*

Anyways, having a vampire in the party sounds like fun. Kinda like in the Witcher books. I do not remember how the characters there interacted but a big part of the story were characters interacting. ",1519862441

Though I think, looking back, it wasn't the tech changing for me.  I always love any new tech and stuff like that.  I was in a r&amp;d role so deadlines weren't too bad.... anyway, looking back I got the most stress from my job role expanding to support some ancient platform that others in the company knew about, but a third party was actively working with it, and somehow it had fallen to me to fix the problems... but most of the time I was spending trying to understand the problem from one end, and talking to the other guys to learn the codebase and somehow figure a fix for it. 

It felt like I was managing them, fighting between the two trying to understand and then implement a fix.  

I enjoy coding.  I never signed up for customer support/managing/meetings.

and for a long while, it wasn't so much r&amp;d anymore it turned to just fighting fires, and having 5 different project managers all telling you they need their stuff worked on first.

An alternative is to analyse the data from the existing spreadsheet.  Excel also has some good data analysis tools, since it is really a flat file database.  However where the data is in multiple spreadsheet then using Excel and its built in language VB become progressively harder.

Another solution is to use a good data analysis programming language to import the data from the spreadsheet then analyse that data.  If you want to go down that route then Python is a good language to start with, it is often used for such projects.

Growing up, I realized how much of an issue it was and tried to train myself to react differently. I actively tried to train my response to be passive or happy, like ""wow, they must be enjoying themselves, they are so loud"". It didn't work, but then again, I wasn't aware of Misophonia at the time and certainly am not qualified to treat someone using CBT.

"sports","t5_2qgzy","&gt; Gamblers Fallacy: the belief that, if something happens less frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen more frequently in the future. 

Or in our terms, the belief that crisis's, or traumatic events, that equate to maturity, are more likely occur the more years you acquire. Your ""chances"" (as you called them) doesn't increase with years. (Though I will admit, they do around and past midlife, for increase health risks and likelihood of loved ones dying)

The gamblers fallacy is hard to use, because so many people don't understand it correctly. 

&gt; Who became legally mature 35 years ago

So which is it, 25 or 20? Legally? Legally they become mature at 18. 

Or should we construe maturity to be the defining factor in gun ownership? How should we measure it then? If not that, should we focus on correlation as you suggest? There's a correlation between color and incarceration rates, should we then bar those individuals *that correlate* from gun ownership?

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","&gt;What do you mean his claim wouldn't be the best? He is a male and the only living son of the Crowned prince he has the best claim unless you want to cut the Targaryens completely out of the picture then the person with the best claim would be our boy Gendry.


There is no precedent for the type of annulment Rhaegar had. There is no precedent for his ""secret"" marriage. And before his death, Aerys disinherited Rhaegar's son and named Viserys his heir - which sets the precedent for Rhaegar's entire line to be set aside. 

Jon should have a tough time establishing his legitimacy, much less making an actual claim to the throne. 

&gt; Having dragons does not make you a good ruler but being the previous Nights Watch Commander and previous Kinf in the North does.

Dragons are not the reason why Dany is a good queen - she is good because she is charismatic, tough, intelligent and has a better grasp of reading people and politics than fans give her credit for. 

As for Jon, he was betrayed as the NWC and passed off his responsibilities to Sansa and went on an extended vacation to Dragonstone. I'd hardly call that evidence of a good ruler. 

&gt;Sacrificing yourself to save innocent people is a great trait for a King or any ruler

Bullshit. A king's first and foremost responsibility is to secure the safety and prosperity of his realm as a whole. That alone makes his life inherently more important than that of some of his innocent subjects. A king HAS to be cognizant of the value of his life for his country. The idiot who rushes into danger to sacrifice himself is a good hero and bad ruler. ",1519862449

The later pulls tend to pull more other stuff, since there will be less product dissolved, but thats not what I was talking about.

You just have the freezed product, but you still have solvent, which is saturated with your product at these temps + side products (which often can be good and/or bad, in case of MHRB great), which you evap down.

This will leave you with some oilish mix, which has a more organic vibe to it, i like it way more than the pure!

"kol","t5_2rfte","Well going by the restrictions in your plan, it would probably be faster to go by standard restrictions and get the extra karma for every run. Granted I have yet to do Ed or Community Service, but you could only outpace the karma gain from standard if you were to finish every run of those in 2/3 of the time. Ex: 4 day Ed/CS. 6 days Standard. And if you can't pull anything due to hardcore and have no usable iotms I do not think you will be that much faster. You can also perm hardcore skills with the karma from softcore runs which would probably be faster if pure speed is your plan.

But you can play how you want and I will answer your questions with my limited knowledge.

1. I would say probably Disco Bandit due to pickpocketing, good passives. Not accordion thief since you can get the buffs from a buffbot. Seal Clubber could be second due to a free resuable banish in batter up.

2. ""Advanced XXX"" skills are only unpopular due to iotms and such being a source of consumables. If you aren't using those get them. In general get whatever increases turn gen (creating food and such) or saves turns. Note that if you do plan on doing Ed, perms don't matter because he can't use them.

3. Doing softcore. But in seriousness: Get steel liver/stomach/spleen ASAP. Learn the mechanics behind each quest. The haunted ballroom can give a -5% combat buff that lasts all ascension to speed up quests. Acquire accordion immediately once you've permed songs, either antique from the desert beach, or toy from armory and leggery (much cheaper). Fortune cookies for semirares. Eventually getting gelatinous cubeling, transcendent olfacition, thick skinned, various stuff that takes some time out of run (not an option for you according to your plan though).

4. If your goal is speed with low resources, a fairy familiar will help with most quests. Once you have built up enough item drop perms a volleyball type helps with leveling. I personally believe it to be a poor idea to stick to only one familiar if you are only allowing base game familiars. And I would only do such to unlock something.

5. Hardcore no iotms, pastamastery/cocktail crafting assuming you have permed them. Pastamastery: use tomatos from the haunted pantry. Cocktailcrafting: typical tavern swill (tavern quest rewards) You will figure out the rest eventually. I have a strong preference for crudles past level 9.",1519862449

I came across a profile that didn't seem familiar, but had the ""she messaged you!"" icon in the bottom right. I was confused, and tapped into her actual profile to see the message preview... 

only to realize she'd actually replaced her fourth picture with a fake ""you've been messaged"" image to make swipers think they had been.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","i’m going to use anecdotal evidence here. my grandmother was abused for a long long time in her marriage. he was a drug dealer that would beat her and belittle her and cut her off from all friends and family. she was a teacher, and sometimes her salary could not cover the power bill and electric bill. she turned to obsessively drinking pepsi because it was cheap and it gave her something she could control in her life, however small. when my POS grandfather finally killed himself, she was very overweight and had been for some time. with my grandfather gone, her life improved and she started to get healthier and lose the weight. however, not long after i was born, she slipped on a patch of ice and broke her nose, tore a ligament in her shoulder, and broke part of her leg. in the long recover after that, she put more weight on, because she could barely move without extreme pain, and basically sat in her house all day with little else to do but eat and sleep. after the recovery from that, she went to the doctor because she was feeling pain with walking. the doctor ended up having to replace both of her kneecaps, as the “cushioning” between them had worn down. now, at almost 80, she really can’t do much walking or exercising, although she tries her best. she would not be able to get anywhere if there weren’t handicap options made available to her. so in response to your post, there are a lot of factors that you have to weigh in when considering why someone has become obese. there is no fair way to pick and choose who is obese through their own efforts or outside forces, and even if there was, its horrible to discriminate against people and make the world unavailable to them because you personally believe that they haven’t earned the “right” to experience the world like everyone else.

Anyway, here's the explanation:

[Look at the actual PDF](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/11791). It's not two emails, it's one email: a forward.

Jacob Sullivan has received an email from opsalerts@state.gov, hit forward and commented ""and on cue."" All this indicates to me is **he is commenting on the alert being on cue, not the earthquake itself.**

Context is hugely important.

If you need more, the alert doesn't actually say when the earthquake happened. The alert is simply info regarding casualties and damage. So the ""on cue"" would hardly be accurate considering the alert is based on press info.

If you need even more, the contrail forum preempts their accusation with paragraphs of insinuating high level govt personal knew the earthquake would happen, before evidence is presented. You should let the evidence speak for itself instead of putting ideas in peoples minds beforehand.",1519862452

All the other companies on the card to my knowledge have not been opportunistic like Dick's Sporting Goods.  Should we not take that into consideration?  Obviously they have a relationship with the BSA and I am not quick to dismiss that.  I just feel that what they are doing is very sleazy.  They could have done it quietly or done it a long time ago.  

My reaction to this will have an impact on my kids.  Do I take the attitude of ""well I am just going to take my ball and go home"" or do I put my head in the sand and ignore it?  Thankfully I can afford to just write a check and not worry about it, but is that the right thing to do?  Then there is another option.  Tell my kids how I feel about it and let them decide.

I hated being pigeonholed into ""girl things"" (on my 5th bday I got barbies from relatives and I cried...my mom let me take them to toys r us and exchange them all for teenage mutant ninja turtles) and my brother has been obsessed with fashion and cooking from the time he could walk and talk (he's a very hipster chef now haha). My mom encouraged whatever we were interested in even if it didn't fit the ""gender norms"" of the 80s and 90s. As I grew up I definitely got more into ""girly"" things and even became a makeup artist for a few years in my early 20s. I still love sports and sci-fi but I'll be damned if I'm walking out of the house without my eyebrows on and some mascara. 

OP, I hope no matter what you end up having, you just let them lead you to what they're interested in...keep an open mind, and love and support them no matter what. I think it's more important to teach your kids to be kind, smart, and respectful than to worry what their gender is.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Depends on the class you're giving the fighting style to.

Archery on say, a wizard?  1 attack action per round, +2 accuracy, I'd say that's maybe a 1/4 feat?  Give that same Archery to a fighter using a bow?  4 attacks per round at +2 accuracy?  That's definitely much more potent.  And yes, I know I took the most extreme examples, but it covers both ends of the spectrum.

I personally wouldn't say to not allow this or give this to players.  In my experience, players enjoy being more powerful, and if that means you have to amp up encounters a bit or fudge the big bad's HP because they went down 2 rounds earlier than you expected, that's easy enough to compensate for.

I just wouldn't give them anything that throws off the party balance too drastically, as you expressed a concern that one of your players seems a bit weaker to you already.

I mindlessly perform the right turn across the path of a Honda minivan. The minivan has to slam the brakes, stops inches away from the side of my car as I’m turning, honks.

In the Taco Time parking lot, I was no longer hungry. I was mad at myself. Why did I think that was anything close to safe? I still beat myself up over it. It’s been well over half a year since then but I still feel terrible about it. That was a minivan. What if the driver wasn’t looking and had a family with children in the van? What if someone got hurt?

Anyway, I still feel awful about that. I can’t get over it. I don’t know if I will, I don’t know if I should. In a way, beating myself up over it makes me focus on the road a lot better. That’s what I need, I’m a inexperienced driver.

One person has written a bot that observes the results of games so that the winner can be proven, pretty much everything you want to do can be done and are already being done for various player run events.

When he was in his first life he was very selfish and manipulated the lives of others to suit his own gains and do what he wanted, but as a result he was punished each time with an early and violent death.  During the current reincarnation he's fooled himself into thinking he's not doing the same, but instead of manipulating others he's the one being manipulated and jerked around.  He just believes he's still in control because of his ego.  An ""It's always been like this so it always will be like this"" train of thought.

The same goes for ""immature but timeless"".  He's naïve in thinking that he knows everything there is to know.  while when it comes to being smart, he simply isn't.

Well, being mortgage free certainly frees up some cash flow, but being 50% paid off instead of 75% paid off doesn't really does it?

Suppose two sisters both go out and buy identical houses, one pays at a normal rate for a few years and invests the rest while the other sister diverts more of her income to paying down the mortgage quickly... 6 years in sister A has paid off a decent portion of her mortgage and has a modest sized investment account. Sister B has gotten to 50% equity by now and gets ready to begin paying mortgage a little bit slower while building up her TFSA. 2 weeks later they both lose their jobs.

I feel like Sister A has less risk at least in the short term. Even if the economy has tanked and her stocks are worth less, she can sell some investments to pay the mortgage, stay in that house and feed herself and keep the lights on longer than Sister B who still needs to make her normal mortgage payments and doesn't have anything above and beyond her normal emergency fund.

If her emergency fund carries her into good employment someplace else? Awesome, she's done well for herself. If she has a harder time finding a good job due to the slowdown... Break her mortgage, pay the fees, refinance and pull equity back out of the house?",1519862460

Let’s not forget that bills such as the one which allowed gay couples to adopt were debated in parliament prior to the votes. Various MPs passionately made the case for implementation of these polices while Theresa May sat listening to their speeches and hearing descriptions of the benefits these polices would yield. She then decided, on balance, that she opposed the legislation.

This wasn’t a one off either. For example, she voted against lowering the age of consent for homosexual acts.

LGB people have had to actively fight against the irrational prejudices held by people like May. I accept that she's changed her views, and I appreciate that, but I can’t forgive her.

As for bank deposits that's just a valid use case of your rights, I'm down for that.


Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman: ""You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities, we could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""

Speaking about a drug policy still in use today. Governmentally Systemically racist.
I'd also point your attention to the disparity between sentencing for Crack VS Cocaine (chemically the same drug)that was only changed in 2010. (I helped petition my congressmen in person in DC to pass this law as a student, led by the most libertarian kid in my school) 


From Wikipedia: ""The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-220) was an Act of Congress that was signed into federal law by U.S. President Barack Obama on August 3, 2010 that reduces the disparity between the amount of crack cocaine and powder cocaine needed to trigger certain federal criminal penalties from a 100:1 weight ratio to an 18:1 weight ratio""

Be careful with this one. The best term for kids below late puberty is probably ""asexual"".

That's only 110w per cell, so 110w/4.2v/.9eff is 29 amps. A vtc5a can handle that when fully charged, but a 30amp battery would be much better as that wouldn't even exceed their rating. In the future I'd bet we'll have 35 amp 18650's that could be put into the mod and that wouldn't even exceed their rating, so future possibilities for longevity are nice.

Running a mod below it's rating means the hardware can last longer as you aren't stressing it, plus it's likely to be more efficient at less than its max rating.

It looks better to people who don't know any better that 220 is better than 200. This is why I really like DNA mods, they won't let you go past 167w without having 3 batteries, much safer.

Pretty much nobody should ever be running a dual battery mod at 220w. I think the absolute limit should be 200, but then what would the marketing team put on the box to differentiate it from last year's 200w mod? If someone really wants 220w I'd recommend a 3-4 battery mod or possibly a dual battery mech with the proper calculations done on it and the proper batteries. ",1519862464

**Find extra money.** Sell crap you don't use. Do online surveys (I make around $80/month doing online surveys, and I complete them at work when I'm already being paid in the first place). Find a small business and offer to manage their social media. Write resumes for people. Edit people's assignments. Walk dogs. Clean windows. Just do *one* of these things. 

**Stop being surprised by regular large payments**. You know Christmas happens every year. It should never be a surprise that you have Christmas related expenses. You know you car registration happens once a year. You know your car should be serviced at least once a year. None of these are unexpected costs but people treat them like they are. You can save for these things all year round by taking the total cost (eg $1000 for registration is under $20/week). 

**Make a budget and stick to it**. Do you actually know what you spend your money on? If you don't, there's a big chance you're wasting a lot. Coffee or soda every day, eating out for work lunches, ordering in multiple times a week adds up like crazy. Quit it.

Add up the average damage of your expected mainhand and offhand, and check the % increase of the amulet damage compared to that damage (mainhand + offhand + amulet damage)/(mainhand + offhand). Then check how much in would be required to break even in dps. We'll call the damage increase from the previous calculation x. You can calculate the int required to break even with final int = 1000/(x - 1).


So for example if the raw damage on your mainhand + offhand = 2000, and the amulet 157.5 on average you end up with 1.078x damage. plugging this in as x we get somewhere around 12000-13000 int. So past 13000 int the damage will be better.",1519862467

1. Advanced stats are your best friend. The funny thing that literally nobody realizes is the fact that grips on shotguns and sniper rifles are both a hindrance because they slow zoom speed and give no real benefits.

2. Folding grip is the best in the game at reducing camera recoil. I noticed that it felt really good on my RPK when I was testing it out a few days ago. The two types of recoil are camera and gun recoil, which are pretty obvious to figure out. The grip that actually has no purpose is the vertical grip because it hurts ADS and does what the angled grip does for hipfire.

3. Depends on the gun, most of the time full sized scopes will decrease zoom speed and walk speed. That doesn't mean that they're worse choices than other low zoom optics.

4. Yes and no. If you get the timing down you can be just as fast, if not faster, than someone who is sprinting normally. It's best used in movement combos with dolphin dives, super jumps, and mega jumps to make it almost impossible for anyone to hit you.

5. Yep, I forgot the rate it increases, but I believe it takes off points every 3 seconds instead of doing it after 10, if you max it out at 3 players on the hill. (Even as a rank 242, I can't exactly remember the timing on this. What I can do is tell a team when to give up because it is physically impossible to win a round when there are about 3-5 minutes left in a round based on the scores.)

I don't believe that it does much here, but let's say it did.  Great: that supports my position that the UK and EU should produce something similar, at least in the long term.

&gt;Think of the EU as the ultimate FTA in reducing non-tariff barriers

I'm not disputing that the EU has value.  If I were a Briton, I would have voted Remain.  But I would also not take a customs union over an FTA or single market membership over EU membership.

&gt;That's what they mean by managed divergence, that in the areas the UK wants, the UK and the EU would make rules together, so they could keep on selling their goods to Europe.

Maybe my view is US-centric, but some EU product regulations, like the infamous requirements on chicken, are designed specifically to keep US competition out of the EU.  The US has stated that it is not signing onto an FTA with the UK if the UK is going to, as a blanket, have the same requirements in place for its internal market as the EU: that basically gives Brussels a captive market in the UK and ability to change the rules of trade between the US and UK.  Any FTA under those terms is not a great deal for the US.

What Britain is talking about with managed divergence is probably ""we're going to tend to follow EU rules but we will not be bound by them for our internal market"".  For practical reasons, the UK probably *has* to use EU standards in the short term, anyway, so that's essentially a polite nothingness in the short term: the UK is not going to go develop her own standards for the hell of it in the short term.  Further out, there's still a need to use EU standards for anything going to the EU (probably a lot of stuff) and it's a pretty safe bet that the UK wants to keep using a lot of EU stuff, so they want to *accept* EU standards.

My guess is that the UK is basically intending to default to using EU product standards but not to be bound by them, and may also accept others.  This is not an incredibly-surprising position.",1519862468

I don't know, but I suspect it doesn't make much difference.  Southwestern USA and northern Mexico blend together culturally, so it's not like immigrating from one to the other is going to change the way you or your children look at life.  It's not like immigrating from Morocco to the Netherlands.  It's just crossing a fence.

There's just so many % increases stacked on top of each other that, when you hit a difficulty level slightly above you, you tend to get one-shot. When I would play my DH in high GR levels, the only enemies that could kill me were thorns enemies, as they reflected damage. I'd die before they even got on my screen because my range was just that stupidly long and I attacked that stupidly fast.

More than that, though, enemies don't stand a chance against the player unless they can near fatally wound you in a single attack. Outside of bosses, there's very little that survives more than a second or three against the player. When you end up being able to regain your entire life pool in two seconds or less, there's very little in-between.

I'd say the whole one-shot thing, ""clear speed meta,"" single target skills constantly being underwhelming, and single mobs being more or less worthless unless they're rare+ are consequences of the breakneck speed that ARPGs switch from one enemy to the next.",1519862469

&gt; Make a list of everything that fits your needs and then go to the library. Flip through them and see if they have monologues. If they do, go home and read them.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's some plays to get you started:
&gt; 
&gt; The Dreamer Examines his Pillow, Danny and the Deep Blue Sea, Millicent Scowlworthy, Really Really, Seminar, Eurydice, Red, Closer, Spike Heels, Jailbait, The Last Days of Judas Iscariot, True West, Lie of the Mind, Blue Orange, The Pillowman, Red Light Winter, Proof, Sight Unseen, Suburbia.
&gt; 
&gt; In bold are ones that I find honestly really funny. Comedic monologue doesn't mean funny, though. Don't play funny, and definitely don't try to make them laugh like it's a stand up bit. They're just looking for a monologue from a comedic play. Something light in tone.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't do Doubt, Angels in America, anything by Christopher Durang, Ros and Guil are Dead, or Biloxi Blues. Don't play old men. Neil Simon's lesser known works and Neil Labutes works that aren't from his beauty trilogy are good.
&gt; 
&gt; I listed some things in here like Really Really and Red Light Winter. They have some good monologues, they have some to avoid. Don't do monologues about rape. Don't do monologues that say fuck more than twice. Don't do monologues for racist characters. Don't do monologues that have a lot of fat jokes.
&gt; 
&gt; You have some more leeway in your dramatic monologue, but still, use good taste. It's not in context of a whole play. This goes for everything in a monologue. It should be a self contained story wtih a beginning, middle, and end.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I finally had some time to go through what you said and the verses you put down. I totally agree on works being important, especially from the multitude of examples from the bible that you provided here. I would, however, say that I don't see how you can come to the point of salvation being through works alone. The bible says quite the opposite in plenty of places. the first that comes to mind is Ephesians 2:8-10. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-10

It clearly states in that example (in verse 8 and 9) that its not by works, or your own doing that saves you, but it is Jesus, and what he did on the cross. To say that salvation is solely dependent on ones good works totally defeats the purpose of the sacrifice that Jesus made. Why even have Jesus as a sacrifice at that point? 

To move into where I think we have some common ground is the importance of works. We are made for works, and I believe in the saying of ""faith without works is dead."" Meaning that you don't do good works to become saved, but you do good works because you are saved. Thats the ""next step,"" in a sense, of the Christian life. It summarizes it all at the end of the verses that I linked in verse 10 where it says that ""we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.""

And mixed this with about a half gram of weed.(yeah i'm crazy i know) besides the horrible trip itself and the thinking i was gonna die, puking and all that good stuff, it showed me something which i had not dared to think before that night. To put it into words is quite difficult but i will try. (Take everything with a grain of salt, but take it.) Essentially it argued that conscienceness is what happens when the flow of time gets caught by an interconnected network of process, a brain for example. It didn't quite argue for this in english but fellow psychonauts might understand me. If you scream into a mic hooked up to an oscilloscope and look at the screen. You wouldn't say that that is the sound. I propose we look at the brain the same way as a machine using the language of chemistry, biology, physics and math to transduce what we percieve to be reality into our conscienceness. This means you are a simulation, because your brain is simulating the ""outside world"" whatever that might be. Sequence 5 when i first heard it made me squeel because it described my journey into the mind with more detail that i had done for 2 months. I believe that ""think, think, let your mind be free. Explore the borders of your reality. And overload your perception or whatever they say in the inverted speech means take psychedelics and check again...

I still doubt it **but** D&amp;D may well have been setting it up in S7. He said ""Now and always"" to Dany's having his counsel--but she belittled and mistrusted it and his motives, and by Ep 7 he saw she'd turn for counsel elsewhere. Then there's his rooting for Jaime a lot and especially in the FoF2.0. Also, there's his Cersei meeting and reaction to her pregnancy. And he's probably in love with Dany.

I actually think this is pretty reasonable, especially given how much psych holds are abused. I grew up in California, but I'm currently a medical resident in Florida and the number of patients I've seen put on holds (Baker Act in Florida) for simply being drunk is stunning.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","You've got a few options.

The headphone jack on the switch will still work while it is docked, so you could just plug a pair of headphones or speakers in. If you've got a PC, chances are you've already got speakers.
You could unplug the speakers from the PC and plug into the Switch, but that's a pain. You could run a 3.5mm aux cable from the Switch to the line in or microphone jack on the PC (or the aux in on your speakers, if there is one). The main issue with this approach is that the PC must be on for the audio to make it to the speakers.

Some people may recommend an HDMI audio extractor, but I believe that would put you back in the same situation as above, having to unplug and replug the speakers, or routing the extracted audio thru the PC anyway. I wouldn't recommend the audio extractor.

You'd probably just want to look at an audio switcher (around $15-$25 on Amazon). Something that will accept two audio inputs and direct them to one audio output, allowing you to toggle between them. That would allow you to leave everything plugged in, only having to plug and unplug a cable directly into the Switch's headphone jack.

You could also use an HDMI KVM with audio switching, which I've actually done (this is the one I used: http://a.co/8KDCpQn) This allows you to continue using HDMI for multiple devices, if you wanted. It allows you to plug in an HDMI display, speakers, and two USB devices and switch between two input devices.

If audio is your main issue, you'd probably just want the audio switcher. Be advised that with the audio switcher or KVM switch, you'll probably need a ground loop isolator to keep the speakers from buzzing annoyingly. They're around $10 on Amazon.",1519862474

"GCdebatesQT","t5_3bm34","&gt; You may be confusing protection based on sexual orientation with protection based on sex.

It's not me. The court has decided that protection based on *sex* extends to sexual orientation. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/second-circuit-rules-title-vii-bars-anti-gay-discrimination-in-zarda.html

*To bolster his conclusion, Katzmann deployed the “comparative test,” which asks “whether an employee’s treatment would have been different but for that person’s sex.” Here, the plaintiff, Donald Zarda, was allegedly fired after he revealed his sexual orientation—that is, his attraction to other men. If Zarda were a woman, he presumably could have kept his job. But because he was a man, his sexual attraction led to his termination. Thus, but for his sex, he would not have suffered discrimination.*

Here a man is protected from discrimination by sex, this is not my logic but the court's.

&gt;All this July 2016 decision did was allow a case to move forward. 

And that resolved the very question being discussed: that Title IX *can* be used to protect men from sex-based discrimination. It does not apply solely to protection of women. It is not a sex-based right.

&gt; What was the final disposition of the case? Does it have one?

There is no name in the article, so I can't know for sure. A related case was settled by the same University. However, for me the important part is that Title IX does protect men and not only women. For the law, sex discrimination *can* work both ways. (Radfem theory can be different).

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","A shame you had a personally bad experience, but in general the Windows 10 version benchmarks better across the board, and it's easy to guess why. Using more native code windows supports far more heavily, it doesn't have to have to use something to interpret like the Java version does. DirectX again is better supported than OpenGL. Your personal experience aside, about the only upside I think the Bedrock version had before the Better Together update was performance.

And Minecraft still was an indie game originally made by one guy with no company. Best selling game, but as far as I know never cost more than $30 and many of those sales were for far less. No infrastructure. And the nature of the game lends itself to servers that stay on. 

You would think some big company would make it better with such a valuable IP, but that's what the Bedrock version is. It's accessible. It runs better. It installs like other programs. But big companies are lazy/rigid, so no mods.

They'll keep working on it, maybe we'll get one. There are a lot of tutorials on setting up servers, and it's easier than it can seem. Just make sure you get the right ip adress (not local, you can easily check with something like seemyip), port forward on the router which most make very easy, and make sure you're not mismanaging ram (don't over allocate for the server or your running version, you don't need to).",1519862480

"leaves","t5_2s9i3","I can only share what my experience was and hopefully it can shed some light on your situation.

I can't smoke weed anymore. As much as I enjoy it, as much as I love unplugging from life and getting baked, I just can't anymore. Every time I do, I regret it about 30 seconds later. Why? Because all of the symptoms I was trying to get rid of come back (anxiety, loss of appetite, depression, nausea).They don't come back as strong as before of course, it's only been one time in a while after all. But then I smoke again a few days later. Then every other day, then pretty soon I'm smoking on the daily and my symptoms have gone right back where I started (sometimes worse in my experience).

To answer your question: yes, you will get the symptoms you described, but at a much lower intensity. The problem is, if you like smoking pot as much as I did, you won't be able to hold yourself to your rule of only once a week and soon you might be smoking as much as you used to (which leads to the full blown symptoms again). Consider that perhaps the answer is in cutting weed out completely rather than keeping it in your system and risking a slide back to smoking on the daily. Whatever you decide, remember that we are here in case you decide to get truly clean. Most of us have found that restricting our weed consumption does not work and we had to (and glad to) give it up permanently. ",1519862480

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","&gt; They're not daemons. We suspect they may be something comparable, but it was only since GS that we had evidence that it was warp related phenomena, previously the best evidence we had pointed away from that.

 I said that the legion of the damned were daemons; Saints are closer to princes since they're in a sorta inbetween state. 
 
&gt; The Emperor until recently could have just been a corpse with a residual knack for directing spaceships. It's still unsure what he exactly amounts to now, warp entity powerful enough to be called a god in that context is an option, but far from confirmed.

The ability to create legion of the damned along with the continued acknowledgement of the chaos gods is enough evidence to support the idea that he's at least close to fully ascending into a god.

&gt; Step 1: How do you get a diplomat in front of RG? How does the offer get to him? If you can't get a message to him, his apparent ability to change anything in the Imperium (doubtful after the Calendar Civil Wars) doesn't matter.

The easiest way to get his attention would be to wake the lion up since the Primarchs have a psychic connection to one another and I know that he's in the rock. 

&gt; Why not let the Xenos lead their own units? Shapers and Stingwings do. I assume Tarellian Dog Soldiers, etc. do, but they have minimal lore.

That might actually be a better idea since that would mean that each unit they would only need a water caste aide to handle translation and communications with the rest of the army. 

&gt; I'm not sure labour is the only hurdle, but it enough of one. Converting entire planets into a megaproject like this is going to take at least centuries if they weren't pressed on all sides and could focus on it. It's a pipe dream as things stand.

2. I don't really buy the conclusion about Sgt. Hammer. I think this is a case of the ""multiple comparisons problem"" or ""alpha inflation"" or whatever you want to call it. While the probability that any given variable is 2 std deviations past the mean may be 2.5%, the chance that *at least one* of 60 or so exceeds this threshold is much higher.

Oh right wasn't public, yeah, I'm making one too, just not gone public with it either.

Only tighten shell plate with the plate elevated so as not to break a pawl.  Snug, but don't overtighten.  Get a Hornady Deluxe Die wrench.  It will help keep the shell plate still and let you change shell plates without stressing anything else on the press.

Get extra LNL die bushings.

Tune the pawls. Mine were out of timing new out of the box.

Keep 3-5 extra primers beyond your batch of loading in the primer tube.  My primer system never hiccups because I never run bottom out.

Clean the grease off the powder measure internals.  It should be clean and bone dry.  Okay, now go clean it again.

Tune powder measure so that metering insert comes up almost the whole way to the top at the top of the stroke.

Buy everything that Inline Fabrication has for the LNL AP, even if you need a 2nd mortgage to do it.  A quick change ultramount and LED lighting too.

Use the zirc fittings.  they're there for a reason. Using them on a regular schedule but don't overlube.

Have runout gauge and a super accurate scale nearby... so that if anyone mocks your press not being blue you can say... put up or shutup... and compare runout of the ammo and repeatability of the powder measure.  You have chosen a fine progressive press.

Search for 76Highboy youtubes on LNL AP.  He went blue but recently announced in a video that an LNL AP will be coming back at some point.  Except, I have NOT had to do any emery cloth or other part polishing to have the LNL run great.  Running the press will do all the smoothing it needs.

Put a tiny smear of grease on the base underneath where the primer ram hits.

Title: **What constitutes a personal injury lawsuit?**

Original Post: 

&gt; Earlier today I was eating boneless skinless chicken breast that I bought from Walmart. I’m the middle of eating it I began to choke on a bone approximately an inch long and very sharp on both sides. Thankfully, my friend was in the living room and heard me struggling. He said my face turned very red and then started turning blue around the lips. He had to actually use the Heimlich maneuver to dislodge the bone  and it finally came up. I took several pictures and saved what was left of the chicken along with the bone. I’m not educated legally in the slightest and was just wandering if it was something worth pursuing because quite frankly, I’m rather upset that there was a bone in my BONELESS chicken breast and it could’ve killed me.

Not pleasant. If you're interested in circ-related PTSD from a clinical perspective, this article can explain it better than I could: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201501/circumcision-s-psychological-damage

To tie it all together, it is very easy to be angry when I see someone else intending to circumcise their own child. Even more so when they adamantly defend the right to do to ""their son"" as my parents did to ""their son"", me. It was never my parent's penis; and it didn't become my own penis at age 18.

So especially at low levels, once you've done your couple of class features there's not that much new to ""explore"" mechanically (even if there is in other areas, like rp).

That seems _insanely_ fast to me, but that's because I almost always run big, epic campaigns with big, epic stories, lots of NPCs that develop over time, PCs whose characters evolve and change, create and then tie up loose ends in the plot, etc. If you don't need to ""go big"" like that, you'll spend much less time on developing the world and the people in it.

Now considering that not all 374 deaths were specifically caused by semi-auto rifles, and that the AR15 platform alone is the top selling weapons platform, not to mention all of the other semi-auto rifles that are available, what are the odds that of those 500,000 at least 375 were from the most popular gun in the country? That's 0.075% of the time with a gun that is purchased [1.3 million times per year (pdf warning)](https://www3.nssf.org/share/factsheets/PDF/AWB_EconomicImpact.pdf).

Also, the less conservative estimates puts defensive gun usage at over 2 million, bringing the percentage needed down to 0.01875%, less than 2/10s of one percent of the time.

Your argument has no backing in facts, only an emotional response built up by the media telling you that the gun itself is the evil object, and the person using it was just a ""broken child"", disregarding the fact that they murdered 17 people in cold blood.  
If you really want solutions, look towards the police that were called 45 times on the shooter and ask why nothing was done, look to the FBI who were warned multiple times that he straight up said he was going to shoot up the school and ask them why nothing was done. If you're so desperate for new laws that will actually make people safe, make some new laws for those agencies to be able to use to stop people like this *before* they kill people instead of shrugging your shoulders and blaming it on the tool instead of the person.",1519862485

Going dairy free was easy for me since I finally realized I had an issue with lactose - like so many others that don't even know they do.  I used to be addicted to buffalo chicken and burgers, etc... but:

Gardein meatballs? Gardein seven grain tenders?   Beyond Burgers?  Follow Your Heart cheese? Coconut milk ice cream? etc.  It's remarkable how tasty this stuff is, how much healthier it is, etc.  Maybe sometimes it costs a bit more than the meat-dairy counterpart, but I consider it an investment in my health. 

Anyway, that's the ""speciality items"" -  that all being said, even just, e.g., refried beans/black beans on a tortilla  with some hot sauce is completely delicious, healthy, and vegan.  Fruit and vegetables and grains, nuts, seeds are all anyone really needs, it's just the constant propaganda and confusion of the meat and dairy industries that has everyone completely addicted and thinking they'll die if they don't have bacon and eggs for breakfast and a giant burger for lunch (which, funnily enough, is killing them).

"TheoryOfReddit","t5_2rtff","I think this problem got far more common when self posts started getting tracked karma. People want karma and so just like link posts with fake stories in the titles and stolen photos, people make up fake stories.

The whole ""so what if it's fake as long as it's entertaining"" notion doesn't resonate with me at all. People often get called out for fake stories in subs like /r/askreddit where someone will look into a user's history and see that they are somehow male and female, a movie producer, in the military, and a stay at home dad simultaneously for example. These users typically get blasted for frequent lying.

However, in the subs you listed, clearly fake stories are often defended in the comments as being good even if they're just entertaining. I frequently see that the posters of clearly fake stories are frequent posters in the subs you listed and their posts are often clearly false, inconsistent, and just nothing like real life.

If people want fictional stories that are entertaining, they should go to /r/writingprompts. Subs that are supposed to be about real stories shouldn't allow blatantly false stories.",1519862486

What's interesting is that people like you seem to refuse to accept peer reviewed research, but happily take the gun lobby's words for fact.

Here's the shogun breakpoint table for [Overkill w/o Body Expertise](https://imgur.com/MpNs3rf)

Here's a Body Expertise table for the KSP [Overkill with Body Expertise](https://imgur.com/ueJukac)

You can tell that they take roughly the same number of shots even when Overkill is active, and that the Steakout needs even more when Overkill is off.  Considering that the KSP shoots about 3 times faster (RoF: ~900 vs 300), it's probably better for dozer killing.

LMGs (especially when you can use bipods) are great now, so I wouldn't be surprised if the KSP build is pretty much just better.  You might stick with the KSP, or try to merge the two builds (note: you can minimize skill point costs in Shotgunner if you use Dragon's Breath, since it doesn't need damage boosts).

If you want to stick with shotguns but work around the range issue (e.g. Birth of Sky), you could ditch the Steakout for any shotgun with high accuracy, flechette ammo, and Far Away aced. That type of shotgun has nearly infinite range, but is even worse vs. Bulldozers.",1519862489

Maybe stop to consider that ISIS is a creation of the US's CIA. It's not really any different than how they started Al-Quaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan.

"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","The sad truth is that for the most part, powering up Legendaries for the upcoming Legendary raids doesn't offer much advantage. Believe me, I've wondered the same thing. 

- Moltres/Entei: They are good against Regice and Registeel. But the Regis themselves aren't that useful and their defense is annoyingly high. So getting enough people to do those raids will be difficult after the first couple of days. Optimal counters won't matter if nobody wants to do Regi raids. Moltres/Entei also aren't future-proof. Heatran or move-reshuffle on Ho-Oh might end up dethroning them.

- SB Mewtwo: Outside of a couple of niche situations, Tyranitar is a superior counter against the ones you mentioned.

- FB Mewtwo: Machamp and Hariyama are better

- Rayquaza: Pretty much what you said. Higher DPS, but less TDO than Dragonite. Also, not future-proof since we will get Dragons with better stats in Gen 4.

- Groudon and Kyogre: Best of their respective types, but what you said is true. Not a lot of use for them and Ground moves are underwhelming. 

- Articuno: Subpar Legendary, will likely be outclassed by Mamoswine in Gen 4. It's the current best Ice type because current Ice mons are underwhelming in general. Tyranitar is better against the Eon duo

If you have limited amount of stardust, stuff like Machamp and Tyranitar are probably better investments. 

But that being said, it might be worth it to look at past Legendary bosses. Cause as this week has shown, it's not that unlikely for Niantic to re-release old Legendary raid bosses. In which case, Kyogre, Raikou, and Groudon become a lot more relevant. ",1519862492

I'm sorry to hear that; life shouldn't be that way. I'm an old codger, 85 years old, and have been an atheist since the eighth grade - that was in 1946. In my view, the rules put forth by the major religions of the world aren't adequately supported by verifiable evidence for me to accept them. Some of the tenets of some denominations are, to me, psychologically damaging. The idea that people are terrible sinners and that there is nothing that we can do about it is a horrible concept. The idea that the world will end soon so that there is no point in education or trying to better oneself has destroyed lives that might have been wonderful. 

I reject the teachings of christianity for various reasons (there is no outside support for biblical miracles, many of the biblical stories just couldn't have happened, the writings are all hearsay written long after the alleged events) so I live by my own ethical system. It's really just the Golden Rule which predates christianity by many centuries. I'm only limited to not doing anything that can be seen as injuring someone. By that I mean no physical, no emotional, no social hurts of any kind.

I do not believe in the concept of sin. Some of my personal rules do overlap some religious ones; I don't believe that there is any circumstance where it is acceptable to kill a person. In some ways I consider myself more moral than some christians because they believe in capital punishment - I don't.

All my blather here isn't intended to cause you to choose my way of belief. I only hope that you can choose a personal approach to life where it is possible for you to see the joy in life. I'll be happy to communicate further with you if you are interested; either as posts on this sub or as private messages.",1519862492

Mexico is a foil for the level of poverty that Shapiro is talking about. It has similar inequality and a lower poverty rate than Israel. It's directly undermining what Shapiro is doing by elevating Israelis as civilized builders by using relative measures. It's also a familiar foil to what poverty could look like in the mid east/israel, but we can't know without more data from mid east countries.

The UAE, and especially Dubai is obviously extremely metropolitan. Everything Shapiro is asserting in his tweet is directly contradicted by Dubai alone. On the metrics we have, GDP and GDP per capita is the best we have. Median household income data don't exist, unless you can find them.

So one with a picture profile in that instance would be worse than without it.

You made the right choice going with no picture profile cause it is just a cleaner image and you get full range in every direction but every video shot that way comes out flat and grayish which isn’t always the best image to look at raw. You can unlock it’s full potential in post with some simple lift gama and gain adjustments and/or lumetri curves depending on your nle or grading software and that is the ideal situation.

I actually had a neat idea about going around the hospital and asking the staff for their ghost stories. It would be interesting to see how many stories are out there...

Merlin 1D is around $2,500 per kN, BE-4 is around $3,300, RD-180 is around $6,000, and RD-68 is around $6,300. Even if the Merlin 1D isn't the best engine from a technology most advances perspective, if the goal is cheap access to space then it is leading the pack.

And no, I care not one bit for decentralization, sticking it to the man, or any of the other possibilities crypto present. They're cool and all, but I just want to make money.

Lee seems to be really pushing for its adoption as an actual unit of currency (the second part of that whole cryptocurrency thing) and that requires stable valuation.

And stable valuation and investors do not mix well.

My logic is if I can turn my LTC into more dollars; great.

If I can use it as a medium of exchange to preserve my dollars; thats OK too.

So the bear scene was probably the most disturbed I've been that I can remember, I remember just scoffing after it did *it* a second time. ""This is just some profoundly fucked up shit going on right now, man""

But I was almost as equally disturbed by the faceless copy at the end. Something about the way it moved and the presence it had over her was really unsettling. Then the wall crush just put it over the top. 10/10 man. 

Plan on seeing it again this weekend.

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","If you want to make use of her default weapon and her tactic skills, then it would be best to put Lilina in a mixed team with another horse. That way, her skill will affect the others and she can also receive horse buffs.

 With a fortify cavalry buff and her unique weapon, she would make a good support unit for TT and Reinhardt counter in arena, or she could use a hone buff to bring her attack up to scary levels and get her mediocre speed up to a respectable 36. 

Green Gift is refineable, and pretty much any option besides +Def is desirable depending on what role you wish her to fulfill. +Spd is always good, but without any merges she'll cap out at 39, or 42 with +Spd seal, which is a bit shy of doubling a good chunk of units. Add in Fury or Life and Death and then you can get to spooky levels.

+Atk is nice, but really, a +2 buff probably won't make too much of a difference. +Res is a also a bit overkill, but it would work well if you want her to bait mages. Green Gift cancels out bladetome bonuses, so she could run Quick Riposte and work as a pseudo mage counter, especially with a fortify buff.

So yeah, I'd say some good options for lilina would be:

Weapon : +Atk/Spd/Res Green Gift

Move: Draw Back/Reposition/Dual Rallies for support or arena score

A: Fury/Heavy Blade/Spd +3/Darting or Death Blow

B: Quick Riposte 2/Green Tomebreaker/Lancebreaker/Bowbreaker for a meh LynHardt counter (untested)

C: Attack Tactic

Special: Draconic Aura/Moonbow/Galeforce?

Seal: Distant Def/Quick Riposte/Attack or Spd +3/You can play around with others.

Hopefully that was at least somewhat helpful. I'd wait and see if there are any other responses first because I'm not the world's most knowledgeable player ever, but I think I've presented some good options.

No, you're just lovesick and hurt and we do dumb things in that state, like answer when an ex calls.

Yep.

&gt;Or is there a way to balance a healthy amount of (minimal) communication.

Nope. The only way to get past this is to stop greeting it every morning and tucking it in at might, you feel me? You won't get over it until you give yourself the opportunity to. Stop answering her calls, block her and start living your life that doesn't involve her.

&gt;My heart hurts and I could use some guidance.

Be kind to yourself, but stern. If she's dating someone else then she's being pretty shitty by continuing to call you and play the feelings game. That should be a strike against her for you. So, protect yourself by cutting contact, and then do something good for yourself that will comfort you. You need to protect your heart from being stupid and hurting you further down the road right now.

"getdisciplined","t5_2uzju","Being lost is okay for a while. So you don't work out. That's fine. You barely drink. That's okay too. It won't kill ya'. Don't want to take a shower? That's fine. You're stinky, but, again, it's not going to kill anyone. You're not cleaning and doing laundry and you want to spend the day in bed? There are worse things that can happen to you. None of these things are awful. 

The point is that it's okay to be this way for a while, be it a day, a week, or even a couple of months. It's important not to beat yourself up about it. Just be an observer. We're not machines and sometimes we need to get off the road and rest.

Like someone else mentioned here, I've always found that writing my thoughts in a journal is a really good first step to changing yourself and your environment. It might takes weeks to see a change, but examining your feelings about things and yourself is the first step toward changing both. You KNOW your place sucks, but if you were to move, where would you move to? Talk about that in your journal. What are the kinds of things do you want in your next place? Write it in your journal. Talking to yourself as someone who is looking out for you works wonders. Just keep asking yourself why you're doing the things you're doing without judging. In some cases, there's no reason to change things until you're ready to. This all may be a way you're preparing for your next big step, whatever that is. And a journal is a good way to get your negative thoughts out of your brain for a while as you search for positive ones to replace them. Even if your first journal entry is about how stupid writing in a journal is, that's still a first step.

I wish you the best of luck!

My personal opinion as a healthcare provider is that using marijuana instead of opioids is just replacing one bad habit with a slightly less bad habit. Like smoking, instead of smoking a cigarette, we tell patients to suck on a hard candy or chew gum.

So too I appreciate the quote you shared. It is strikingly similar to a passage in the Confucian analects, which discusses the process of order. From self, to family. From family, to community, from community to city, etc etc.

I dont quite see how your logic applies to my opinion on the meaninglessness of benevolence. Perhaps you could use another example? What does benevolence mean to you?

With regards to matters of intent and consequence, does benevolence hinge upon intent or consequence? I equated maliciousness with benevolence, so I think by your logic, benevolence would be a matter of intent as well.

I live in a way that many would describe as moral, or benevolent. A few might say that by my actions, I practice Ahimsa (absolute peace, the nonaffliction of suffering upon others). I practice a vegan, local diet. Give free massages, give my time to teach tai chi. Always bike, never drive.

I dint think I am being moral or benevolent when  I help others. I dont think I am not, either. The terms in my opinion, simply dont apply. To my mind, I dont help others. I help myself. I dont refrain from hurting others, I simply refrain from hurting myself. 
Humanity is one body.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","Wrote most of that between classes, now for one final few points:

The priestly caste is a necessity, or has been a necessity, in every human society throughout human history. Be it primitive shamans, or classical period oracles, or Buddhist monks, throughout history the role of a *priest* has been just as fundamental as that of a warrior, that of a merchant, and that of a sovereign. The general roles of priests tended to involve not just overseeing rituals and services, but initiation of people into the *tribe*, administration of the state, arbitrating local disputes, overseeing charity, it's a role that's been exploded into a thousand different specialized individuals and, in some sense, has been lessened because of that.

In early America, as an example, the colonization of most of the east coast was almost entirely *unintentional*, colonies would be centered *around* the parish, *around* the priestly caste, and as they grew bigger then--in true protestant fashion--the parishes would split apart like an amoeba, they would go elsewhere, and a new priest would lead the community until it too grew and split.

What we see *currently* among what I deem the new ""priestly caste"", is a kind of decentralized demagoguery. The priest is a specialized role because he functions with purely divine authority, the mythology that binds the local community together, as well as his function as arguably the closest *to* the community (given his role in initiating members to it and overseeing ritual) gives him a level of trust and responsibility that cannot be said for the lawyer, the merchant, or even the mayor. Given the creation of new ""priests"" is entirely *laissez-faire* and based around winning a mob over and keeping them distracted with new targets to hate, you don't see these people use power *constructively* or *responsibly*, but rather to destroy businesses, to destroy other people, and then ultimately to destroy itself in one gory purity spiral.

Let me put it like this: there have been bad priests before, there have been bad popes, but even at their *worst*, given being a priest requires one to be *ordained*, and given that a code of ethics existed and there was a foundation in scripture, you would have the priestly caste *mostly* insulated from the worst powerseekers and demagogues, and with their power gained in a ritual ceremony, they would not have to reaffirm it constantly through terror or distracting people with mob targets.",1519862504

"science","t5_mouw","With SSRIs, it seems likely that it isn't the increased level of serotonin that treats the depression.  It may help with some symptoms or it may not, but the main benefit is something that is indirect and delayed.  SSRIs only take a week or two to raise serotonin levels to the intended amount, but it takes 1-3 months or more to see the effects of treatment.  It also doesn't always work, even when it does help with symptoms.  That indicates fairly strongly that SSRIs don't just work by elevating your mood- they do something else, or allow something else to happen, which has a larger and more permanent effect on your brain and allows you to form positive feedback loops that let you find meaning and give you a way to fight the constant, numbing barrage of negative sensation.

Ketamine and MDMA are being investigated for depression treatment currently.  They work very differently: an infrequent (say, monthly- it varies) treatment leads to long-term improvements, and it usually involves much more guided psychological counseling.  Treatment with SSRIs usually involves passive listening, which has been shown to have the most consistent (reliable) positive effects on patients.  NB: this is all stuff I have gathered from reading psychology blogs, I don't have firsthand experience.

One theory is that the drug creates a positive mindset and temporarily stops the negative reinforcement, and during that time the patient can re-associate harmful, traumatic, or stressful ideas with more positive feelings.  That way, once the drug has worn off, you can think about those things without immediately being hit by the negative emotions they usually carry.  Under normal circumstances the negative feelings cause a kind of Pavlovian pain response, but you inevitably circle back to those ideas again because you feel bad.  Breaking that loop is key to improvement in all areas of life- everything from demotivation to fear and depression.

So in a way they may work similarly, by setting up an environment where feedback loops can be improved.  The mechanism is very different though.  You wouldn't be likely to feel much from SSRIs- you would just slowly feel less bad (if you're somewhat lucky).  Other drugs may actively make you feel good, or actively make bad things easier.

&gt; I was never sure why that is so. One explanation I could come up with is that there wasn't enough serotonin/dopamine to inhibit uptake of, or more likely, that it doesn't target the right part. Any idea why NDRI doesn't work but direct dopamine release does?

SSRIs and NDRIs aren't meant to make you feel good- things that make you feel good are too easy to become dependent on.  They are supposed to set up an environment in which to improve, one which will still work when you stop taking the drugs.  It's also possible to do that with feel-good drugs, but it's much harder.  Chemical happiness isn't long-term, so you have a limited time to fix yourself and most people lose focus on self-improvement when the drugs give them the option to simply focus on their life.  If they don't happen to fix themselves, the drugs only lift them to a higher fall.

As for how and why they work differently, dose certainly plays a role.  SSRIs lead to a pretty consistent, moderate increase.  More immediate drugs always have peaks and valleys, even extended release drugs.  During the peak you'll feel happier than you would on an SSRI or NDRI.  It also provides a contrast, while an SSRI or NDRI is near-constant.  Beyond that it's anyone's guess.  Depression can't really be located any better than ""around the front of the brain"".  We don't know where feelings or emotions live, or how they work.  We know that changing certain chemicals in the whole brain or even the whole body can have impacts on aspects of some feelings and sentiments, but that's essentially it.  It's like trying to perform surgery with a sledgehammer while blindfolded.

If you have or suspect you have bipolar disorder or repeated acute depression, antidepressants may be [less effective at treating those disorders](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-efficacy-of-antidepressants/).  Major depression (DOES NOT REPRESENT THE OPINIONS OF MEDICINE IN GENERAL:) usually features hard-to-break, self-destructive feedback loops that are psychological rather than chemical.  Bipolar disorder, and maybe sometimes acute depression, are chemical problems.  Your brain just gets very sad for no reason sometimes.  That can't be treated by breaking feedback loops, because they aren't the thing holding your down.  In that case it would simply be malfunctioning brain chemicals and circuitry causing you to be sad for the wrong reasons.  Those can be treated by damping the swings (antipsychotics, bipolar medication) or by going after the symptoms (please do not self medicate, it can be dangerous).

After a while we stopped our crusade and things seemed to have improved. No one mentioned it, it bothered the friend mentioned, but everyone seemed to stop bullying some of our nerdier friends after they saw the weeaboo and brony take down a couple of the wrestling kids and the Minecraft gamer beat the hell out of our future prom king.

"ContestOfChampions","t5_333zp","I think this issue with Trucos has been boiling for a long time - a couple of years now - simply, Trucos doesn't respect the other content creators and selfishly utilizes other people's work without having due conversation and permission as well as previously not giving due credit. 

It's because mcoc content creators did not wish to deprive the community of their work that they resisted having outright conflict and complaints of plagiarism with Trucos - in part of respect for his own hardwork and contributions. In my experience, most creators would get some form of permission and respect boundaries from the creator on reproduction of content. 

Respect and consideration is a two-way street built and maintained through good communication; all of which needs to be reciprocated by Trucos towards other content creators such as /u/mdkosu - it's better than what it was two years ago but there's always room for improvement when it comes to copying and plagiarism.

"Clojure","t5_2qkej","Assuming by larger-than memory, you're not talking about larger-than-disk, i.e. disk-backed structures are ""ok"", I ran into some useful libs a while back based on MapDB. I'm not sure what the current state of the union is, but here:

[spicerack](https://github.com/jackrusher/spicerack)
[clj-mapdb](https://github.com/ngrunwald/clj-mapdb)

If you're looking at distributed data (i.e. cluster-based stuff) then there are wrappers for many of the bigger systems, like spark, Hadoop, etc.  The distributed computation section of [clojure toolbox](https://www.clojure-toolbox.com/) has a useful subset.  Datomic is an option.

Depending on ""What"" you're doing with said dataset....it's also possible to process it sequentially and stream over it rather than eagerly load everything.  I've had mixed success with [iota](https://github.com/thebusby/iota), but it's a good library for reducing over large delimited text files in different ways.

[outboard](https://github.com/datacrypt-project/hitchhiker-tree) may be useful if you don't mind running redis.

Note: one of the unspoken memory hogs in clojure (really java &lt;=8) are Strings.  If you're dealing with large datasets and parsing them into Strings, using string normalization via a string pool to only store a single reference may make storing the dataset feasible.  Primitive storage types help too.  
I use a [string-pool](https://github.com/joinr/spork/blob/master/src/spork/util/string.clj) for stream processing and compression - you can invoke it as a replacement for str, and control the cache size - , along with my own [table library](htps://github.com/joinr/spork/blob/master/src/spork/util/table.clj)which allows for typed-schema definitions and eager loading of data into an incanter-dataset-compatible table, or streaming of primitive typed records.  The table implementation uses primitive collections where useful.  Between typed parsing and string pooling, I was able to get some serious gains in memory and processing speed.  Strings are the biggest bang-for-the buck (Java 9 uses string pooling apparently).  

[soac](https://github.com/bnyeggen/soac) is another clojure lib that uses primitive-backed storage with convenient clojure idioms.  That may be a good way to go.

Via interop, you can also tap into additional libraries (like spark or tablesaw).

Also, thanks for the question! I will look into adding a disk-backed dataset implementation to incanter.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I think the variety of online savings accounts that have been mentioned which are paying around 1.5% currently are all good spots. 

However, I would suggest to at least consider the rest of your financial goals before putting such a large down payment down. It’s not wrong to do so, and maybe the lower mortgage payment is what you need to afford the house you want in your budget, but if you have other things like high interest debt or retirement that is a while into the future, that cash would be better served, mathematically, to go to the places with higher interest rates/return. 

In concept, if you were to put a big down payment down and redirect the monthly mortgage savings into an investment that earns say 8% over 30 years, and compare that to putting the entire amount of cash in that same investment at the beginning, after 30 years you would have more in your investment having put that cash into the investment instead of toward the down payment. 

This assumes your investments earned a higher rate than your mortgage rate but, historically, stock markets have earned more over 30 year periods than your mortgage is likely to be in five years. 

In addition, instead of handing that cash to the seller at closing, you keep it for your (better) future or a rainy day.

Just something to ponder. ",1519862511

"Dallas","t5_2qnkr","I guess. But what about LA's city planning has Dallas copied? Honestly I have no idea what an example is. If there is one, I'd be very interested in it. When you've grown like Dallas has has, there are only so many things you can even look to, but drawing inspiration from like sized places isn't some deep inferiority complex like it's spoken about on here. There was some post the other week here about one of the Trinity River bridges and how it was a giant vanity project because the people in Dallas want us to be like Madrid or something absolutely retarded. Sure. Rich people are vain and they can get their influence to do vanity projects in cities, but holy shit, that's not something unique to Dallas, and that bridge is far from some creeping example. In fact Dallas people seem to usually be generally anti-vanity more than not. Sure that bridge is a nice part of the Trinity River Project, but there was a massive push towards a tollrod there in the floor plain that most people seemed indifferent to and pretty much seemed like it was going to happen. For a town of rich people with an inferiority complex trying to be some world class city with expensive and unnecessary things, that seems like the last thing that would happen. Hell. Most people were anti-Klyde Warren. 

And that's not to even realize that DFW is the 4th largest metro area in the country, and the largest not connected to a massive body of water. If our city planners aren't talking about other cities and what they've done, that would be a bigger, issue, IMO. For example, I am continuously disappointed by the Trinity River Project, but the Buffalo Bayou in Houston happened. Renovation of a river and the surrounding flood plain isn't something Houston invented. Hell, the Trinity River Project far outdates the Buffalo Bayou. But if the Trinity River Project draws from the Buffalo Bayou, that wouldn't be anything but what's normal. ",1519862512

"writing","t5_2qh2n","&gt; How do you explain your world's systems to readers?

You don't. Explanations are boring to read. In fact, from the perspective of narrative, systems in general are boring. A story is *characters* with *goals* facing *obstacles.* In fiction, a system -- whether it's magic or martial arts or aerial combat or plumbing or a recipe for a really good *spaghetti alla puttanesca* -- is a tool for characters to solve problems

So you *show* readers ""systems"" by having the characters *take actions.* Those might be actions to achieve goals or overcome obstacles (or maybe create obstacles for other) Magic system? Show the characters using magic to solve a problem. Aerial combat. Put them in a plane, and send them into combat. 

This is what the old writing adage ""show, don't tell"" means. Don't explain it. Show it in action.  

&gt; The best idea I have heard is to send my characters to flight school, bringing the readers along to learn with them. 

Good grief, that's a pretty terrible idea. :-( 

What are you going to do, write a scene with the flight instructor saying ""Okay, class, open your Cesna-172 flight manual to Section 6. Today we're going to cover Weight &amp; Balancing, including learning all the weights of the onboard equipment""?? *Yawn!!* 

Even in something like the Harry Potter series, which is set at a school, the vast majority of the story happens *outside* the classroom. Most classrooms are poor sources of drama for fiction because most classrooms *are* (unfortunately) designed to be information-imparting mechanisms, which is pretty much the opposite of storytelling. Don't believe me? Break down the classroom scenes in Harry Potter.  You'll find that most of those scenes aren't about learning magic (or even explaining it), but rather are using the classroom to set up a future conflict between characters. 

If readers want to learn how to fly, they can go for their pilot's license. They don't want to read a novel for that.

"SecurityAnalysis","t5_2s7v0","The short answer is that $500 is the gross exposure but the liability carried on balance sheet would factor in the actuarial probability of the frequency and severity of claims.  When you roll that policy together with several hundred thousand others the claims on auto policies are actually pretty predictable compared to many other more esoteric insurance risks.

The longer more technical answer is that the total insurance liabilities carried on balance sheet are made up of various accounts each with their own purpose.  First premiums are earmarked into an unearned premium reserve liability and ratably earned over the life of the policy.  Next claims are divided into various categories ranging from fully baked exact settlements that have not been paid yet or are paid over time, to known claims that are being adjusted/litigated, all the way to an estimate of unknown claims that have not even been filed yet.  As you work your way through these varying degrees of uncertainty, the actuaries have to make more and more assumptions about the future.  But it is based on statistical science so pretty accurate for the most part (but then often manipulated up the ladder by shady management).

It gets (much) more complicated from there because then statutory and GAAP accounting have variances for some lines of insurance as to how all those reserves and liabilities are calculated, and as to if and at what discount rate future payments should be NPV’d on the balance sheet.

Insurance accounting is both fascinating and mind numbing!",1519862514

Still, a lot of people miss the moral of The Little Engine that Could, because people aren't familiar with how trains work anymore. You see, the titular little engine is supposed to be a [switcher train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switcher). 

Switch Engines, or Shunters, are small train engines that, like the little engine says, move larger engines or train cars around rail yards. This is why the Little Engine that could is called the *Little Engine*. They are *literally* really [really small](http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1774788). Like [really small](https://www.narrow-gauge.co.uk/gallery/images/311/666.jpeg).

That's why people are scoffing at the Little Engine at the beginning of the story. The idea that this [tiny, punk ass, little train](https://sites.google.com/site/camelbacksteamlocomotives/home/1-0-4-0-0-6-0), that normally pushes unloaded train cars around one by one on level ground, could pull an actual load *over a mountain* is ridiculous.

But they do it anyway, and prove all the other big trains wrong in the process. And that's what the story was always about all along, overcoming the limitations and labels that other people place on you. 

After all, if this little engine can cross a mountain and do what none of the other big trains were willing to do, why haven't you done the goddamn dishes yet???",1519862514

A gas van or gas wagon (Russian: душегубка (dushegubka); German: Gaswagen) was a vehicle reequipped as a mobile gas chamber. The vehicle had an air-tight compartment for victims, into which exhaust fumes were transmitted while the engine was running. The victims were gassed with carbon monoxide, resulting in death by carbon monoxide poisoning and suffocation. The gas van was invented and used by the Soviet secret police NKVD in the late 1930s during the Great Purge.

**Death of Conrad Roy**

Conrad Henri Roy III (September 12, 1995 – July 13, 2014) was an American marine salvage captain. His suicide at the age of 18 with encouragement from his long-distance girlfriend, 17-year-old Michelle Carter, was the subject of a noted investigation and involuntary manslaughter trial in Massachusetts, popularly known as the ""texting suicide case"". The case, Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter, involved many text messages, emails, and phone calls between Carter and Roy at the time of Roy's death.

The fertitas were imperfect in many ways but they had a formula that worked for over a decade. Change is in the air and they got out of the game at the exact right time. To some extent, they pump-and-dumped the business through Conor and his money fights. 

Now WIMG is left with a formula that is half the old system and half absolute garbage that only works for a couple superstars. MMA has grown precipitously over the past decade and it is up to WIMG to figure out a formula that works going forward into a dynamic and rapidly changing future.

It is a really difficult problem being tackled by a company that really doesn't have a ton of previous experience, because there is no opportunity for previous experience.

* WC era expected points are 2/15\*.25 + 1/15\*.5 + 1/15\*1 = .133 per team per year. 

With the WC game the expected points per team per year increases by 1/15\*.2 to a total of .147.

You are. I think the best reference for this is to carefully read section 3402:

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/3402

(Scroll down to ""(f) Withholding allowance"")

.. but the idea is that you're allowed to request allowances. From the IRS perspective your company did not withhold incorrectly, it just misunderstood how much _you_ wanted withheld. That's different.

&gt; Is this loan legal? 

yes.

&gt; Should I take the loan or should I talk to a lawyer/accountant? 

It sounds messy. I would not want to owe money to my employer and would seek another way to pay these funds. A lawyer would not be worth it.

They came to a city that was suffering an epidemic of people disappearing. Some backstory: the paladin was notorious for spamming detect evil and using the result in place of real roleplaying. 

I needed to punish him. 

So when he started detecting evil at first I told him all was clear, but as he started getting further into town I told him there was an evil person. He drew his sword and called for the guards to seize that man but when they ask for evidence he had none so they let him go.

While he was looking for clues he found another evil person, and then another. Finally I tell him ""sometimes people are just evil, that guys evil, that dwarf is evil, that cat's evil.""

He paused for a minute before answering ""I know intelligent races can be evil but animals are always neutral. Get that cat!"" And he and the rest of the party give chase. Naturally the cat runs because people are chasing it and at level 2 catching it is easier said then done.

Finally they grab it in the middle of the market place and at this point the actuall players are out of breath from sheer frustration at how long it took for their characters to catch it. The Paladin picks it up by the scruff of its neck and proudly calls out ""I've caught the murderer.""

The townsfolk back away slowly and avoid eye contact and he realizes he still has no proof. He let the cat go.

They eventually waited for nightfall and caught the demon before it could abduct another person and killed it. The cat was never seen again.",1519862521

And the only reason for that is that with a blink you often want absolute max range and require immediate casting to be able to live through something. The downside of clamping blinks is that you have to make sure you position properly before casting, for example if you're trying to get over a wall. Mostly, though, I think clamping does more harm than good.",1519862522

No it's not.  5.56 is designed to be light weight so that soldiers could carry it, but just large enough to still be effective for the purpose.  Most of it is also FMJ which is much less lethal of a design than your standard handgun JHP, like every police department in the US carries.

That doctor is comparing a wounds from a rifle to those of most gunshot wounds, which are from pocket pistols firing tiny cartridges.  Those are the weakest guns in existence.  Anything else is more powerful.

The other points you made, don’t really follow the same logic as this, so of course they sound ludicrous when put like that. You’re assuming that shaving your head is equal to “giving up” when really it’s just about taking advantage of the situation preemptively, instead of ruminating on insecurities. 

Well you were the one who brought up Jason Statham, i maybe missed your point as it wasn’t clear what point you were trying to make. I never said he was gonna instantly look like a sex god by shaving his head. But he would probably feel better by taking a step to combat his insecurity instead of trying to cover it up or hide it.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","**Jainism**

Jainism (), traditionally known as Jain Dharma, is an ancient Indian religion. Followers of Jainism are called ""Jains"", a word derived from the Sanskrit word jina (victor) and connoting the path of victory in crossing over life's stream of rebirths through an ethical and spiritual life. Jains trace their history through a succession of twenty-four victorious saviors and teachers known as Tirthankaras, with the first being Rishabhanatha, who is believed to have lived millions of years ago, and twenty-fourth being the Mahavira around 500 BCE. Jains believe that Jainism is an eternal dharma with the Tirthankaras guiding every cycle of the Jain cosmology.

The main religious premises of Jainism are ahimsa (""non-violence""), anekantavada (""many-sidedness""), aparigraha (""non-attachment"") and asceticism.

***

**History of Jainism**

History of Jainism concerns a religion founded in Ancient India. Jains trace their history through twenty-four tirthankara and revere Rishabhanatha as the first tirthankara (in the present time-cycle). The last two tirthankara, the 23rd tirthankara Parshvanatha (c. 872 – c. 772 BCE) and the 24th tirthankara Mahavira (c. 599 – c. 527 BCE) are considered historical figures, though many historians date them both about a century later because the Mahavira is widely accepted as a contemporary of the Buddha, and significantly more historical evidence is available for the Buddha. According to Jain texts, the 22nd Tirthankara Arshth-nemi lived about 85,000 years ago and was the cousin of Hindu god Krishna.

The 2nd makes no sense in full under the view that guns are merely for govt defense forces.  Why are govt guns necessary to the security of a free counter?  They aren't.  Under your reading, you honestly believe they're saying: ""We need a military to keep us safe, and the military's right to keep and bear arms shan't be infringed?""  That seems totally bizarre! 

Finally, I feel the court's interpretation also aligns with the context at the time.  Do you see the founding fathers being more concerned with national defense or tyrannical govts?

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Obviously destination matters but not because of history but because of resources. Western Kentucky just simply doesn't have the resources to compete with the big schools. I think if Saban went to western Kentucky he obviously wouldn't win a national championship but he would turn them into a good team. Good coaches win games, a schools history doesn't win games. Recruits go to Alabama now not because of Bear Bryants championships but because of Nick Sabans championships. 

How many times have we seen Michigan, Nebraska, Texas, Notre Dame, etc.. switch coaches and have someone who is supposed to put them on top because of their history fail? It's a coaches game, good coaches get good players to play within their system and win games. One thing I will say is I think prestige is more important to coaches than it is to recruits, some coaches have dreams of coaching at certain schools, so that can be a factor in landing a good coach.

But as far as recruiting ya its definitely important but A&amp;M recruits well enough to compete on the national level, and that's with Sumlin so I think Jimbo will do fine recruiting wise. I have a little brother in high school he was two when Texas won the national championship. That's the age of these kids getting recruited now, they were toddlers when Texas was in their most recent glorydays, Recruits aren't concerned about what happened when they were toddlers. Texas and A&amp;M will both continue to recruit well would be my guess anyway. 

But I really think people overstate the importance of recruiting, Hell A&amp;M's been putting good players into the NFL the last few years but having good players doesn't matter when you don't have the coaching to back it up.",1519862530

If you run enough tests and get a .1% difference every single time, that's a statistically significant 0.1% because it's constant. Reliable.

Any difference that can be determined to be reliable is a measurable difference.

And, when dealing with ""instructions per clock"". As clocks go up, that difference multiplies.

The idea that 0 is the only possible baseline is asinine, especially as the peaks of the scale go ever higher. Hell, as the valleys get higher too.

A chart with a bottom marker of 0 when the lowest actual result is 1 million would be so fucking useless.

Tinker shares this distinction with a group of other notable heroes - Meepo, Invoker, Arc Warden, Lone Druid, Nature's Prophet and Visage.

These are heroes that require an investment of time and effort to learn how to play properly. Because of this, most casual players never spend a lot of time on them, and thus the argument ""well if it's so strong why don't you just pick it!"" falls sort of flat for them.

This group of heroes just feels fucking awful to lose to, because it makes the player feel outclassed. Doesn't help that these are common smurfer picks as well.

**Experience:** Bought Feb 2, 2018. Shipping ETA  was Feb 19, 2018 (Small Packet) and arrived Feb 27. Well packaged. I really like buying from dokodemo world and they have become my preferred sellers for JP products.

**List of products:**  

* Hada Labo Gokujun Hyaluronic Face Cleansing Foam Refill 
* Rohto Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel 140g
* Omi Brothers Sun Bear's Super Strong Plus
* Skin Aqua Sara Fit UV Silky Essence
* Rohto Mentholatum Water Lip Unscented
* Rohto Mentholatum Water Lip Tone Up Rose Pink 

Total cost with shipping: 3568JPY about $42CAD

A couple of these were on sale. Hada Labo and Skin Aqua Super Moisture Gel are for my SO. He likes the cleanser which is why I got the refill but we haven't really found a good sunscreen for him yet. I used the Skin Aqua Gel last summer and liked it as a commuter sunscreen and we both like pump packaging. The other sunscreens are water/sweat proof so that I can wear them for outdoor summer runs. I've used a Rohto Water lip balm before and it was an excellent lip balm under lipstick.

I'm just running a version of the Standard list that I like, so no Shieldbots, no Quartermasters, no Musters etc. Besides, subbing a Quartermaster for a Fungalmancer works surprisingly well anyway. Less raw stats, but way more versatility and synergizes better with Call to Arms.

US run finished at **12-1**, EU run finished at **9-3**. So yeah, Dude Paladin seems strong here. The toughest match by far was Secret Mage, followed by Jade Druid. I got pretty lucky in both runs and practically didn't face any Warlocks.

Most interesting tidbit: In my final match on the US servers, My 11 win opponent was playing [**Quest Shaman**](https://i.imgur.com/Ebo7ISY.png) out of all decks. That was kinda weird.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","&gt; when there's so much at stake

Not really. It's a minuscule thing in the grand scheme of life. 156 people died like this since 2010. About 15-18 *million* died for other reasons. Around 0,0009%. Sure most of the 18 million were old people. But also about 2-300,000 kids in the age range of 5-15 died in this time interval for other reasons ([source example](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/mortfinal2007_worktable23f.pdf)). About 260,000 people died in road accidents. It's three orders of magnitude difference. And there are 300 million people there.

It's an extremely low chance, it's basically just a curiosity and something people can get worked up about, but it's not the kind of thing that influences the average people's lives, except for stressing about it because of the 24/7 news coverage and the most shocking stories discussed over and over again.

"WWEChampions","t5_3d2ee","I don't have Brock, but this is a similar conundrum for many PH. Other classes too, but often with PH. It's often just a matter of taste, but I think the issue sorta comes down forcing consistent wins via pin or submission: without a finisher it can be hard to do that, unless what you replace the finisher with can do that anyway.

With Roman, the finisher is useless because the non-finisher red puts Blast Gems on the board which move the pin bar nicely and at lower MP cost. With Striker Sting, on the other hand, the optimal moveset is G/G/Y but that's damn near impossible to force pins, so some people run BL/G/Y instead. 

All a matter of taste. You wouldn't be crazy for running R/B/Y.

One important note though: those optimal movesets assume fully maxed out trainers, so your mileage may indeed vary in that regard as well! If I could get Titus to 3S I'm sure my Bray would be deadly, but since I don't buy Enhance packs, it's not easy to get him past 2S...",1519862532

You're right from an ARM borrower's perspective that as rates go up, default rates also go up. However, most ARMs are guaranteed by the agencies so from an investor's point of view, you'd experience a prepayment since the GSEs guarantee principal and interest payments. It's actually kind of funny because for an MBS investor, and by extension an agency mortgage REIT investor, one of your key risks is prepayment risk. If you own a noncallable corporate bond, if yields fall from 5% to 4% and you own a bond paying 5% coupon, your bond price would rise above par since investors would be willing to pay up for the additional coupon.

In the resi mortgage space however, borrowers can refinance which means as an investor you get your money sooner than you expected. This is in fact a bad thing because if you owned a 5% coupon MBS and interest rates fell to 3%, well you just got paid back at par whereas a similar corporate bond would have been priced above par.

The inverse of that is extension risk where you have some baseline assumption of prepayment speed and all of a sudden rates back up and you own a 3% coupon MBS and prevailing rates are 6%, your bond price would be heavily discounted. But in addition, fewer people would refinance or prepay (maybe they're locked into a great rate and don't want to move and pay the higher mortgage rate for example), which means you own a longer bond at a lower coupon than what you originally expected. You can see how volatility hurts you as a mortgage investor, and in bond parlance this is known as negative convexity.

Well, for an ARM, because rates reset, a borrower doesn't have as much of a rate incentive to refinance, and as an investor, your coupon adjusts to the prevailing rate. In other words, you'd expect ARMs to be priced much closer to par since the coupon cash flows adjust to market conditions. Therefore, if the borrower defaults because of the higher rate kicking in, getting prepaid at par doesn't really impact you much as an investor, and in fact you might prefer getting paid back faster in a higher yield environment to give you more flexibility on asset allocation",1519862534

&gt;Let's see the statistics.

As you may well know there are no statistics specific to road rage or impulse shootings, just FBI crime rates. My take is based on simple observation, where for a couple years I've observed armed road rage events occurring randomly across the country weekly and almost daily. The observation aligns with the [FBI reporting two years of increasing violent crime rates](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/25/violent-crime-rising-throughout-us-fbi-says.html). You may have seen AG Sessions hyping it.

Even the gameplay complexity increasing is unlikely to make up for a lack of interest in basically everything else, because if you're only there for the gameplay, there are other more gameplay centered games (than basically any JRPG) out there.

My point is that the atrocities and crimes of the US are often excused because of the crimes perpetrated by native Americans. What the poster I originally replied to was saying was, essentially, your system sucked and what we did to you isn't so bad in light of that.

The problem with that line of thinking is exactly what you've been saying: every culture is complicit in violence. Because the idea of American exceptionalism is so particularly prevalent that attitude is even more toxic here than in other parts of the world and is used to justify our own past and ongoing crimes against native groups and other peoples all over the world. Reflection on our own history is something that is seriously lacking.

Because every group is responsible for violence it's important to acknowledge your own. I'm not a Native American so I don't care about the crimes they've committed. But I am an American and understand that there is a certain level of prosperity afforded to my society because of atrocities my own ancestors have been documented as perpetrating.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes your gender can be informed by your sex, but your biology is more diverse than your sex. For one it includes your hormone regulation, which can change before, during, and after puberty due to genetic and environmental factors. After all, it is hormones that are the root of both your sex organs and your brain structure/chemistry. Thus we can begin to tease apart sex hormones vs sex organs. If your brain continues to change after you have developed a sex organ, your gender can also change.  
Secondly, what is labeled a ""mental illness"" or ""normal psychology"" is simply an arbitrary distinction given by society at large. The reality is we *don't know* what is normal, and to state that someone's psychology isn't conformist enough for you is totally discriminatory. Not too long ago, all women were believed to be prone to being ""hysterical"", and could be forcibly committed to a mental institution for no other reason. It makes sense to discriminate against socially dangerous psychologies that are violent and destructive. But what purpose does this genderqueer discrimination serve other than making cisgender people feel more comfortable? It is just continuing to to deny that trans people exist.

Stating that society's standards are enough is a total non-starter. Imagine stating to a gay man in 2008, ""you should be fine that your boss fired you because you have a husband, society's standards are perfectly reasonable.""  

How can you support that non binary-ism is rare? What if people who might be genderqueer are discouraged from exploring their gender-queerness, from people like yourself? Perhaps that is the reason why you are seeing more people start to pursue their true selves, because some of society is beginning to accept that they exist.

Labeling ""gender queer"" like mental illness is the sort of thinking that has led to thousands of queer people being forced into ""conversion therapy"" to ""cure"" them of their illness. Being gender queer is not an illness any more than being a man or a woman is an illness.

Who made you the gate keeper for gender queer people?",1519862537

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","Thanks for covering this case! I can't listen right now, but I'm wondering: do you go into the question of why Trevor turned down Haddington Road? That's always been the one big question for me. To get from Baggot Street to Serpentine Avenue, you'd keep going straight down onto Pembroke Road. You wouldn't turn down Haddington Road, specially on a night like that when you'd be in a hurry to get home.

It's also not a detour you'd make if you felt like you were being followed and you wanted to be somewhere safer. Both those streets would've been pretty deserted at that hour on a bad night, but Baggot Street is a lot busier, more open and more brightly lit than Haddington Road. 

The only reason I can think of is that someone mentioned, on another thread a while back, that there was a 24-hour shop on the South Lotts Road (down the other end of Haddington Road). There was a Spar on Baggot Street, just a few steps from where Trevor was last seen, but I don't think it was 24-hour. If Trevor had really needed something, he might have taken the detour. It's hard to imagine someone doing it at that hour in that weather because he fancied a packet of crisps, but he might have done it if he was a smoker who'd run out of smokes. 

I'd be interested in knowing whether Trevor smoked, because if he didn't, I really don't get that detour. And when the last thing someone does before going missing is something inexplicable, it seems like it could matter.

Until you can point to a box on a shelf, with a single device inside for your head (and at most a couple accessories to hold in your hands), which gives you the full experience - including a dedicated source for content designed to run on said device! - it’s not even worth having that mainstream adoption conversation.

Heck, you can’t even show someone your current, quality VR setup without a wheeled, padded Pelican crate full of hardware and a space to mount it. You need a few accessories (keyboard, mouse, display) just to run the hardware that runs the other hardware/software that allows the other other hardware to track itself.

At least with Pete Dunne, he wrestles outside of WWE even though he is the UK champion.  Lesnar is just sitting on his ass with the title.  And hes making nice with UFC.  Roman Reigns certainly does come off way better in this storyline or not.  He does get out there week after week and does his job pretty well. 

 I wasn't that big on Reigns early on when i got back into wrestling in late 2016 when i had heard what happened at the royal rumble.  But seeing that he is actually trying out there and he actually does look good, Im a fan now.  I just think they could have done much better with him early on.  

Even if this is a WWE ploy and a cheap way of getting Reigns over, people have to move on and see that he's earned his stripes a bit more now than he ever did. 

Lesnar now, I have grown tired of the whole Suplex City crap.  He can't even speak for himself.  Paul Heyman has to be his advocate.  Like Lesnar is that big of a deal.  in 2004, he unceremoniously left the company in one of the worst matches i have ever watched, thank god he got stunnered by Stone Cold the only person that didn't deserve to be put in such a bad match in the first place even as a Special Referee.  he returned in 2012 but as a part timer only (or when the money was good to him and the place was good).  That is not at all how a wrestler should be.  The true sacrifice that it takes and the dedication, its not there with him.  that sucks to watch and it sucks to have that shoved down your throat.

"paydaybuilds","t5_2yibe","Extra, mostly irrelevant trivia:

There's a special issue with shotguns/dozers normally referred to as ""favored pellet"" mechanics. You can read about in the Long Guide if you like (ctrl + F ""one piece of Bulldozer armor""). In short, if X pellets hit a dozer, and Y of them hit the visor, you only have a Y/X % chance to deal damage to its visor instead of the normal 100% to deal headshot damage on a simultaneous head and body hit.  This means a percentage of your visorshots on dozers deal effectively no damage until you can actually hit him in the exposed face.

Another issue is that the game (I think) usually does not tell you the exact value of your weapon's damage.  To see why this is an issue, look at Steakout's non-Overkill damage.  The top chart says that it takes 63.88 to kill a heavy swat (a tan) in one shot, but we don't actually know whether a weapon that says 63 in-game is actually dealing 63.0 or 63.9.  In this case, it doesn't matter a whole lot because you have Underdog (which adds 10% if 3 or more people are around), but if you want to be super sure that you pass this breakpoint, I'd either test in game or add the cheapest permanent damage source you can find (probably shotgun impact basic)

I'll be the first to admit that my knowledge of game mechanics only goes so far.  If anything I say contradicts [The Long Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=267214370), it's right.

I know that, and I'm all for that. That is different from [Remote Surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_surgery), which is what I'm suspicious of. 

The ""first real remote surgery"", [The Lindbergh Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbergh_Operation), was done in 2001 and the tech appears to [still be being tested as recently as 2015](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2927471/healthcare-it/robot-performs-test-surgery-1200-miles-away-from-doctor.html). Reading about its success sways me a bit, but there's still problems other than viability in a perfect situation- there's still the issues of possible internet outages, DOS attacks, and plain ol' tech failures.

Saying ""It should stop now"" is hyperbole, fine, but with the state of technology right now I genuinely would not trust **remote** surgery. If there's no other choice then there's no other choice, but I'm skeptical that a situation where the only choice is going to a hospital that can afford $2 million machines while simultaneously not having a surgeon that can do the needed procedure presents itself that often.",1519862542

That is only a few hundred less than my take home pay after retirement contributions and health insurance, which means we basically rely on my husband’s income for all of our other bills and expenses. I wouldn’t say we’re uncomfortable but we’re struggling to save money for an emergency fund, down payment on a house, and to cover student loan payments.

The only real deterrent the DPRK has outside of a nuclear response is basically to fire on South Korea and/or Japan. This is problematic and would probably never happen because:

**A** - It would isolate the DPRK on the international stage (moreso than it already is)

**B** - It would destroy potential infrastructure that would be useful after unification

**C** - It doesn't actually stop the US from completing an invasion

Of course, anyone with a brain realizes just how bad the ""we'll attack our neighbours if you attack us!"" deterrent is. It wouldn't work - that's why the DPRK is making a push for a nuclear deterrent, which not only would make the above deterrent much more abhorrent, but also provides an actually useful defensive tool against invading forces.

Without a nuclear deterrent, the DPRK would be in the same position as Iran is today. It's much easier to villainize the DPRK of course, so I imagine it'd be a bigger target for neocons (who *still* want to attack it right now, even though it has *fucking nukes*).",1519862544

You needn't go back to the Mortis Gods, but you can. In a way, TLJ was remniscient of them. Luke on an island in a Forcetemple. Kylo and Rey circling each other, each his own version of Luke in the mind (heroic Jedi vs evil Teacher) and in truth Luke is just Luke, neither and a bit of both, the one in the middle. Be it a middle of inaction or one of action employing both aspects of the Force. 


There even is a special blade, Anakins saber, the Mortis Dagger, Rey and Kylo are fighting for like Son and Daughter. It all leads to Luke/Father's death directly or indirectly.

But once an alien enters the country, the legal circumstance changes, for the Due Process Clause applies to all 'persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.”).

Further, from Clark vs Martinez:

&gt; One of the government’s tactics has been to deny release to people who are “paroled” into the United States, meaning that they are physically allowed into the country while their status is being determined. Technically, they are not considered to be “in” the country

From what I can gather, if a person is still 'at the border' (airport, port or, presumably, detention centre), the fifth amendment does not apply to them - only to people considered 'in-country' legally or otherwise. Happy to be shown otherwise, of course.",1519862547

Claramente quienes tienen ingresos en blanco van a atenderse por OS o prepaga en un privado. El servicio público de salud da respuesta a quienes quedan excluidos de ese circo: o sea, los más pobres, entre los que se puede incluir también a muchos extranjeros de mala situación económica (como quienes trabajan en talleres textiles en negro).

Para revertir esta situación se necesitarían muchísimos recursos extra, y con la recaudación impositiva actual es ya casi imposible. Además que ya no es muy eficiente que el trabajador aporte para la salud dos veces (con sus impuestos y OS/prepaga), tal vez tres si prefiere la prepaga a su OS. Si ahí venís a aumentarle muchísimo más los impuestos para gasto en salud, se hace insostenible.

Habría que volver a empezar de cero imho para tener un modelo de salud pública noruego. Lo cual no puede suceder de un día para el otro. Y tampoco es posible un modelo de salud mayormente privado como el de EEUU porque la población excluida es grande y ya se la está manteniendo (en EEUU al fin y al cabo también tienen que darles prestaciones a los más pobres y ancianos, algo que Trump igual está aniquilando).",1519862547

Usually kids who are highly rebellious aren't self-conscious enough to understand exactly why they are rebelling either.  They feel that there's something wrong with their lives or their treatment, but can't always put a finger exactly on what or why.  They look for things to identify with, or statements that reflect their feelings, but often only manage to identify a portion of them, or misidentify due to finding and affiliating themselves with stances or groups that are similar enough to feel like they're on the right track while pushing them into areas they wouldn't have gone to on their own.

If you are a parent and are worried about your child coming under these influences, some of the best things to help them to move away from them would be to help them reason.  Try to understand and be open-minded when you do.  Ask them questions about their feelings and what feels right about the things that they're getting into.  Try to guide them to find answers for themselves by aiding their reasoning, rather than trying to tell them what to do or what not to.",1519862549

Its okay for me to trade farm, even against a vayne and just wait for ganks, if my top laner is 5-0 and mid is 3-1-0. Because, so long as we keep getting advantages et al, we will have a better teamfight. Sivir getting her fed frontline to run at you is a scary prospect if noone in your team is actually fed.

However, the people who are in plat or diamond or w/e, who time and time again take stupid decisions/macro wise and yet are still at  that rank, are gonna be pretty mechanically good. They are at a good rank, purely based on mechanics and very slowly learning macro. They are the ones who will sometimes throw the game trying to carry a won game, or a game that is progressing nicely, purely for their ego.

Which is kinda scary/sad. Because you have to lane against them and shit and that can be tough, mechanically they are among the best in any game in that mmr they queue up into, but they are so frustrating to play with (and against). When you are losing, they won't ever let your team wait for a nice opportunity to 5v4 or 4v3 the enemy. Or push waves and catch out their overextended solo laner 2v1. They'll just keep 1v1ing and probably dying, sometimes resetting their gold. They'll justify it in their brain saying 'game was already gg since its 12 kills to 6 or w/e, but thats literally a good teamfight away from you having the gold lead.

Try coordinating with a top yasuo. He always wants to 1v9 and dash through everyone. That can easily turn a won game sour, because if he dies taking a mismatched fight (i.e 1v1 vs their fed top laner, or a 4v3 etc], you can't exactly contest a whole lot 4v5 esp. since you probably don't have a guy who can facecheck neutral objectives since your mid / adc and even supp simply cannot facecheck.

Sometimes i don't even understand whats happening on my screen in plat [ as in some crazy outplays], because some of the players are really fucking good at the micro / have played like 5x more than me and it shows with their understanding of all the champs. But they still have the same MMR, because they don't do macro/other shit properly, or even half right.

Its so nice when they listen to your pings, and actually end up winning without having to teamfight mid / late game due to picks / having a split pusher you play around / having baron vision. Makes it so you really have to outplay to win that 5v3 against us! [Ain't happening!]",1519862549

I may change the Guardians scenes as I noticed how there is some substantial evidence proving that Thor, Rocket, and Groot go on their own mission to the Dwarves where the Soul Stone might be located.

I based the Soul Stone being located in Wakanda on the fact that Thanos’ army attacks there and the fact that in “Infinity War Prelude Part 2” the page on the Soul Stone shows space, which indicates that the Soul Stone has something to do with space.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","On a plagiarism scale from Zero to Shia, Einstein rates above Mencia and below Freud. 

Prior to Einstein, the Jewish people suffered the stigma of having not produced a genius and were considered to be intellectually and artistically sterile owing to their self-imposed insulation and religious aversion to enlightenment ideas. 

Einstein gave the Jews their genius and not only their genius but **The Genius.** Indeed, Einstein's artificial cult of personality can be seen as an outgrowth of the new phenomenon of relentless promotion in broadcast media. He was a figurehead of the New Modern Jew and was swept up in the campaign to present Israel as a modern nation. He was probably the single most powerful endorser for Zionism, something he openly admitted at the time. In fact, Einstein was offered the Presidency of Israel and refused. He never lived in Israel.

This is an absolutely fascinating and exhaustively researched explanation of the myth of Einstein. Especially compelling is how challenges to Einstein were shouted down by his brethren by calls of Anti-Semitism which as you know, halts the scientific method in its tracks.

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","What are you even talking about lol. 30-06 is 7.62x63mm. The M14 was never updated to 30-06, it is chambered in .308 Winchester (civvies) or 7.62x51mm NATO for military-issue rifles (of which we really do not use anymore). If you see a 30-06 M14, it is probably a civilian conversion or a civilian market firearm, since 30-06 is a popular round in the civilian firearms market.

30-06 would not be an upgrade anyway. It is a vastly overpowered round for military rifles. The United States and most of the world around the early twentieth century desired powerful, long-range cartridges that could be used for volley fire at 2000m or more. In practice, we now know that volley fire is vastly ineffective, and that 30-06 has far too much recoil for sustained shooting for most soldiers. 7.62x51 NATO is powerful enough to reach point  targets at most common engagement distances as well as area targets at further ranges. 

NATO countries began a move toward intermediate cartridges around the 1960's and 70's because they hold a number of advantages over larger rifle rounds like 7.62x51 and 30-06. They are lighter (you can carry more for the same weight), they are still accurate enough for point targets between 400m and 800m depending on the rifle/carbine, they still carry adequate stopping power, and they are more easily controlled and less harsh on the shooter. Thence comes the AR-15 platform of rifles (and the AK-74 platform) that have largely replaced larger rifle calibers--and even larger intermediate calibers (7.62x39).

Why don't any insurance companies cover the cost of childbirth classes or doulas?
 Serious question.    Why is it that no insurance companies will cover any part of the cost of prepared-childbirth education or a doula fee?    Women who take classes or have a doula are way less likely to request drugs or epidurals, and therefore, are less likely to need a c-section (necessitated by drawn-out labor or complications from drugs/epidural)    Why will insurance cover all the medicating yet won't cover anything that is statistically shown to reduce the NEED for the actually medicating?

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Shield is kinda a meh mechanic, when added to random mobs without specifing how it is generated.  It’s basically just give them more health. Ironically, what I though your mechanic would be is a more interesting idea, even if it still pretty dumb.

And just throwing cc out there isn’t interesting even with the existence of stability. Especially in this game. Give people ways to avoid the mechanic that doesn’t involve stability, and sure, fear might be cool. But if the only way to avoid it is stab, all you are doing is adding a thing that has no fun gameplay added in avoiding it, and a ton of anti-fun gameplay added if you fail to avoid it. At least SA is another thing you have to think about that every class can contribute to. Walls are not salvageable as you wrote then, they disrupt movement way too much. Damaging pool walls that cripple you, but still can be moved through are better. I clearly was less impulsive then you.

As for what I would do: first thing, copy some of the better wow ones. Volcanic would be awesome, teeming and grevious would be cool. 

Then I would do opposites of stuff we have, like for example buffed at high health

And last, mechanics from raids, dungeons, and other fractals that aren’t in convergence. Torndoes from TO, minor 1 person green circles, the soul walls from souless horror, soul shackles, stuff like that.

That company also gets money when it licenses its format to CBC for The Great Canadian Baking Show and they have control over important aspects of the production so their brand isn't tarnished. If they sold a show to BBC and it then became public domain, they would lose out on  things like the ability to renegotiate a contract if the show is a success, they'd lose out on money for licensing if other markets like the show, their brand could be damaged if other broadcasters make shows copying them and they aren't as good, etc. Why would any creator choose to give up all that revenue and control by making anything for a public broadcaster if your plan came into effect and ask public broadcaster programming was public domain?",1519862556

External HDDs have a much higher demand than internal HDDs.  Your average consumer doesn't buy internal drives, at least not in this day and age.  Most consumers these days have laptops and so they want external disks.

If profit margin is $100 on an internal drive and $50 on an external drive, but demand is higher for the external drive and you sell 4x as many of them, then you make twice as much money as on the internal drives.

They lower the price of the externals because they think they will sell more of them than how much they lose from dropping the price. 

They don't think lowering the price of the internal models will generate a higher enough demand to make up for the price drop.

The demand elasticity for internal disks is low.  They know that even if they charge more, like they do, about the same number of them will be bought.",1519862558

It's to make sure your body is getting the nutrients it needs, no matter what your caloric intake is (deficit, maintenance, surplus).  Yes, ""losing weight"" only requires a calorie deficit, but by that method of thinking, you would lose weight on 1500 calories of rice, but not get the nutrients you need.  
Macros are broken down into protein (4 calories per gram), carbs (4 calories per gram), and fat (9 calories per gram).   Alcohol is technically considered a macro, but it's obviously not necessary to health.  In very, very simplistic terms, protein is for muscle, carbs are for energy, and fat is for brain function and satiety.",1519862558

Obviously, it would be ideal to get a full body movement in VR to optimize your experience which would include running and jogging, but I think the best way to do that currently imo is with the joystick only. Gamers would prefer to do less than more ie move the joystick slightly to walk slow and a lot to walk/run faster vs the additional physical movement of running in place. Perhaps with foot-tracking that would work out nicely though and the joystick might not even be necessary for the mechanics you described.",1519862560

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Apple, Microsoft and Google have dedicated teams of people selling into the education market. A part of this selling effort is offering significant discounts to these organizations. 

Apple especially is doing this very effectively. They can offer a district a whole managed ecosystem of hardware, OS, management tools, software, apps, leasing, etc. They present one single quote to the district that's all inclusive. There's no finger pointing when something goes wrong, it's all Apple's stuff.

The school district my kids are in is all Apple, they manage all the equipment with two admins, and they lock my daughter's iPad down tight. The apps they use are really quite good for education, and the teachers like them. They allow the teachers to do stuff like lock all the ipads in the classroom so the kids aren't distracted.

It's very slick, it's very scalable, it's very well thought out. Apple is huge in education, it's a huge part of their strategy.

The biggest thing I see missing from your proposal is how to manage hundreds or thousands of client devices, get software and data on them, and do that year after year with good continuity. A very skilled Linux admin team who is going to be able to put that stuff together and keep it going is going to be expensive and very in demand for jobs the school district can't match the pay level of.",1519862560

However, a crucial difference is that in MbP (aka factitious disorder imposed on another), the caretaker will try to hide the fact that they had any role in the other person's illness. Think of a mother who will inject their child with insulin to provoke seizures, but pretend that the child has epilepsy, so she can play the role of mother to an ill child.

In contrast, the person in this story is not hiding the fact that she is responsible (at least in a basic causal way) for what happened to these children. Her role in the situation has to be more known, so that she can be the focus of attention, comfort, and worry.

Given the differences, I don't know whether her actions constitute MbP or something else.",1519862561

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;The time period the OT was writing about? When it was written? Or compiled? Cause the first spans thousands of years.

The point is the modern world is so different from everything that came before it. The modern western mind is vastly different from what came before. 

&gt; Yes. I never states otherwise. Late Second Temple.

Well yes, but no one in the second Temple period would have thought God was non-violent or that God hadn't freed Israel with a outstretched hand and punished Jerusalem with the armies of Babylon. I realize you didn't say Jesus was a modern man. But the claim that Jesus announced that the one true God was non-violent sounds like a modern progressive trying to make moral sense of ancient texts. 


&gt;Examples would be great.

Its largely apocalyptic violence because the NT are apocalyptic texts. Jesus says angels will throw evildoers into a furnace at the end of the age. He says God will summon an army to destroy the town of those who refused to come to the wedding feast. He says God will destroy the owners of the vineyard and replace them. He says he will slay those who did not want him to be king when he returns with authority. He says he will kill the followers of Jezebel with death in Revelation 2. God sends an angel to kill Herod in Acts 12:23. Jesus says that God will soon sentence many in Jesus' generation to Gehenna because they murdered the prophets. There's more, hard to miss.

Right now, what the game does is look at every possible T10 that can drop for you (uniques excluded), and chooses between them equally. So the game would see that you have completed [T10] Orchard already, and that you are geographically adjacent to [T10] Bog, so it will randomly select between those two maps.


With this change, that same scenario would still be choosing between only those two eligible maps, but [T10] Bog would be favored 2:1 over [T10] Orchard.",1519862563

Oh, and Morrison is talking five billion in GDP this excessive net migration gets us but doesn't talk about the *costs*.

Oh, and hospitals. And prisons. And roads. 

And pray tell, what happens when those 250K per year in net migration become old themselves? Should be bring in 500K to support them? Then a million to support those 500K?

You cannot run a society on excessive migration. This isn't about infrastructure spending - there are literal limits to what you can do in the face of this flood.

Take a look around where you live - any empty land suitable for a school? There's none where I live. It's all been taken by business or housing.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt; the debate around religion has basically been settled. on the internet, anyway. 

I wouldn't say that. From observing the culture war surrounding GamerGate, it seems more like the rise of social justice simply re-drew the battle lines. From that perspective it's another pattern of the culture war causing rifts and alliances where none existed before.

Consider: The bulk of the social justice movement is full of religion-hating atheists. That's what Atheism+ is all about: combining anti-theist/atheist/anti-religious attitudes with SocJus. If there are religious people who are in SocJus they are more likely to be from groups SocJus considers oppressed (Islam et. al). I have noticed very few actual Christian groups aligning themselves with the Woke.

Meanwhile, among GamerGate supporters (and people against SocJus in general) there are a lot of people with different religious views. Several of the mods, and a *lot* of people who regularly post here are Christian, or nominally Christian. I've also seen people post here practice Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, Hindu..... certainly not as many Christians, but they are here.

The rise of people like Jordan B. Peterson, who has a different approach to viewing and analyzing religion, also appear to have been causing some of the more fedorable among atheists to chill out.",1519862564

I don't think Jason Botchford will rip on this contract. I don't think anyone will. From every angle it's a solid deal. However...

I don't know if you've been around r/canucks for the last week or so but it's been no more evident than now that certain media outlets are a non stop barrage of criticism. There's just no way to spin a positive light out of anything. They don't even try because sensationalism and critical-mongering soap box idiots get more clicks.

As evident in the fact that your mind immediately went to Jason Botchford. I could have been talking about Ian Macintire for you knew. But who's the smarmiest douche around?! You know it. I know it.

I don't know about you but when I was a kid (I've been a Canucks fan since I was 11. A long time before corsi and hero charts) at the start of every season I legit thought Vancouver could win it all.
Even in the (spits) Messier years.

Fast forward to October 2015. There was a provies article that stood out to me/stayed with me after a loss. Jason Botchford said something to the effect of 

""Don't expect this team to do anything this year. They suck and this is why"" 

This was like 3 months after Calgary bounced us from the playoffs. 

The kicker is the Botchford was absolutely right.

The shitty part of that situation is that Linden and Benning were trying to sell hope while this guy was on the sidelines saying 

""Dont listen to these guys. We're doomed.""

**In my personal opinion** that undercuts everything it means to be a fan. That does not say I want to keep my head buried in the sand. I know this team sucks. I also like to think there's a light at the end of the tunnel and guess who orchestrated it? None other than Jim fuckin Benning and Trevor fuckin Linden.

Well don't they want money from Poles? They do. They made an industry out of holocaust - a death of 6 million Jews and few million non-Jews. 

&gt;Any reliable sources that it's all about wanting to steal property ?

Israeli ambassador lady said that they don't like our reprivatisation law. Szewach Weiss when asked in a debate vs Grzegorz Braun repeatedly said that Poland needs to sort out the property left behind without any heirs to it and give something for it. If your immediate family dies out the property is given to the country... it ain't tribal thing so Israel has no claim on it. And tbh these Jews lived in Poland for 100s of years so the claim itself is ridiculous. 

&gt;And how come it wasn't mentioned up until this recent shenanigans ?

Oh it was mentioned numerous times. Jewish world congress guy Robert Singer said in 1994 IIRC that Poland will get slandered until we pay up - 65 billion dollars at the time. 

&gt;Did ""my elite"" just decide they wanted to take your shit after the recent law ?

The law removes the victimhood monopoly on WW2 from the Jews so the attack was pretty obvious. And I guess someone gave them a green light - probably the US. Israel couldn't have done it without american approval.

It’s a nice break from the crowded, congested towns of England, but I do feel rather isolated out here with no 24/7 public transport. I don’t drive which isn’t a problem if you live in the London area, but in semi-rural Finland you’re basically screwed unless you have a car or some good friends. 

I’m travelling with just a parka that has removable thermal padding and faux fur hood lining which has actually been excellent for keeping warm here. I also layer like mad, wearing thermal layers under my clothing and all my socks and jumpers are wool which really helps. My only weak spot are my legs, even with leggings the cold goes straight through the jeans as you’d expect.

Fortunately I don’t go out much apart from car to indoors and from bus to airport though so it hasn’t been too uncomfortable. Stay warm!",1519862566

So when they go crazy it's not like oh these animals just are this way naturally, I just have complete sympathy for them and feel bad for them. It's kind of like we as humans don't get it yet, it's such a crazy thing to think about that we do this to other living feeling beings.

"ar15","t5_2reap","If you're getting a PSA kit then your upper will be complete which saves you from needing to buy a few tools. You'll just need to build the lower, which is much easier imo (full disclosure, I've never assembled an upper before so I don't know how difficult it really is, but it's certainly easier to build a rifle with a complete upper since ~50% of the work is already done for you).

Make sure you get a buffer tube wrench for installing the buffer tube and castle nut. I bought [this](https://www.ganderoutdoors.com/product/details?pdesc=TAPCO-Intrafuse-AR-Stock-Wrench&amp;i=202914) one simply because it was cheap and I had a coupon code for Gander. But it works. You can also use that one for installing and uninstalling muzzle devices which is a nice bonus. 

You should also have a decent punch set. I bought a cheap Weaver punch set on Amazon. It was like $30, which isn't actually cheap imo, and the quality actually kinda sucks, but it works. You'll need this for things like installing the roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch. It's also just damn handy to have around if the need ever arises. 

You may want to get a magazine vice block too but it's not necessary imo. I built my lower in about an hour without needing one (I took my time) but it can make it easier by acting as a third hand. Beyond that just make sure you keep track of all your small springs, pins, and detents! Watch YouTube videos to see how things go together and then reference either videos or other online instructions while you're building.

1.  Was the incompetence of such degree that no reasonable advocate would have acted in that way?  If so,
2.  Did any such incompetence cause the hearing to be unjust?

Even an incompetent advocate might not make the hearing unjust.  In *Nicholas-Pillai v GMC [2015] EWHC 305*, the court found that the appellant's advocate was ""completely out of his depth"" and should never have taken on the case for the appellant.  However, it found that despite the gross incompetence of the advocate, the appellant's hearing had been fair - the incompetence had not caused the hearing to be unjust, so the second of the two conditions above had not been met.  The appeal was dismissed.

&gt;Also there is the danger of low voltage + high current (this is how spot welding works). Sparks and molten metal flying all over.

This is a secondary thing, i.e. it's a burn/fire risk, not an electrocution risk. Bad burns? Sure. Death? Well, I'm sure somebody's managed it, but like the guy with the 9-volt, you'd have to try pretty hard.",1519862568

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","The branching on q_2 is there for a reason. Both branches are supposed to accept a different part of the original language.

It's stated as a^(i)b^(j)c^(k), with i = j **or** i = k. This is, any words with same number of a's and b's **or** same number of a's and c's.

On q_2, you read a number of a's, storing them on the stack. Then, you have two possibilities: if the word is in the language, the number of b's needs to match, or the number of c's needs to match.  
The upper branch starts popping the a's from the stack as it reads b's, ensuring they're the same number. After that, it can accept a word that ends with any number of c's.  
The lower branch reads any number of b's, and then pops stuff from the stack to make the a's match with the c's.

So, on part I: What effect does removing the transition have? This is, what happens if you can't read anymore c's after matching the a's and b's? Note that the lower branch is left untouched.

If you can study this case, part II should flow naturally.",1519862569

By the way, my so called ""support"" for Nopixel and ""his"" crew invariably involve paragraph upon paragraph of laid out argument and evidence supporting my opinions, views and conclusions. 

This to you is ""sucking off Koil and his NoPixel Crew"". Interesting. 

You on the other hand barely manage putting a dozen words together in an understandable sentence, rarely without a poor attempt at an insult - always supportive of TFRP, no matter the abuse of power. 

Time and time and time again. You ignore hypocrisy. You attempt to insult (and those attempts are pitiful), you defend, you hedge - no matter the abuse of power by TFRP admins. 

I can criticise all - TFRP and NoPixel alike - and have done so. But you Jachim, you barely seem to comprehend the confines of your own limits in both argument and me giving a fuck.

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","I'm sorry that this happened. It's very scary, and while it seemed unexpected, dogs will behave inappropriately if they are not trained to behave appropriately.

Do not ""put him down"". 

If you've noticed him being protective over objects (even at all) you should recognize that while you've thought it was a small problem, he thinks it's very serious. This is absolutely your family not taking manners training seriously. **Every single puppy** needs to be trained as to how to live appropriately with humans. Not every dog needs tons of training on every single possible thing, but every dog needs training on lots of things.

Your family should absolutely read books like Sophia Yin's [How to Behave so Your Dog Behaves](https://www.amazon.com/Behave-Behaves-Revised-Updated-Editon-ebook/dp/B004GUSDK4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519862343&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=sophia+yin) and call a local trainer to begin to learn how to teach your dog proper manners.

Also, unless you are professional dog breeders, have your puppy neutered. 

So, the answer is both training and neutering.

If your family can't commit to training him properly, again...don't put him to sleep. At least take him to a proper no-kill shelter to be rehomed to a family who is more interested in training.

At one point one of the purple belts said he had no problems with big guys and we were similar in weight (we then weighed ourselvesand he was 60-70 lbs more - I don't know why but even when I keep telling everyone I'm tiny, I guess I look bigger or something).  In this particular case, I'm guessing it's because he's kneed me hard in my abs during our rolling and was surprised it didn't break me (at least that's what he said).

This time, I assume, he went for the same thing but we were practicing a new technique (some kind of a throw from guard to gain side control but neither of us actually knew it so shit happens - he's a super cool guy and def. didn't mean to do it) and I landed on my side as his knee came, I tap, but it was too late.  I came back next day to keep going not knowing much about ribs and a brown put me hard on my ass - at that point I was out for good..   I'd rather not go into more detail about that as I've already posted about this about a month after it happened (was asking about fees as they made me keep paying them while injured) - everyone told me to just switch schools and the instructor wasn't paying appropriate attention etc. but I don't/didn't have enough experience to know this so I rather not presume too much (half my classes were taught by blue belts who didn't know my level as he was often MIA)

edit: on a more positive note, everyone is similar size to me at the new school - however, this time there's a huge language barrier.  But I will return after my chiro appointment (my broken foot is still healing, which is one of the reasons I've stayed away from light sparring - basically my entire right side of the body was smashed to pieces over and over with one instructor (and often higher rank) yelling/urging me to not give up/push harder (and mid-sparring it was hard to tell which pain is which so that's what I did) and another instructor blaming me for going too hard and hurting myself ""because only I know my own body"" (as a white belt I knew fuck all about how hard to go of course.. anyway shit happens thanks for the advice mate).",1519862573

If your buddy has a bunch of lenses and other Canon specific gear, it might be worth buying Canon so that you can share. If he's on the kit lens, then there's not as much of a point.

Video, travel, and versatility wise, Sony is a good bet. There are some extremely good/fast wide angle lenses that are mirrorless specific, and Sony can use most Canon lenses with a $300 adapter. There are also some very compact packages available, such as the A6000 with the 16-50mm pancake zoom.

Video wise, Sony is one of the best options.

Generally, body is less important than lenses. If you know what kind of lenses you might want, look at what's available and what they would cost you when buying a body. E.g. the new AF-P 70-300 and 200-500mm AF-S lenses are good reasons to go Nikon.",1519862574

As for the TK, Grievous has tanked blows from far stronger TK attacks than these, and they had little to no affect on him save for pushing him back. Plus, since this is legends Grievous, we've seen him dodge TK attacks before, consistently. If Voldemort tries to hold him in the air, Grievous always carries a gun on him, just in case. Grievous will also be able to close the distance very quickly, so Voldemort isn't going to have a whole lot of breathing room.

It's also a bad habit to get into – `!` is `!` because it's a warning that something is dangerous.  If you use it liberally, you train yourself out of seeing it as a warning.

It also robs you of a lint rule.  Having a rule that warns you about `!` is no good if it's littered all over your codebase.",1519862579

Don't get me wrong, though: shibas are really wonderful dogs, and when you get familiar with the breed, they're quite charming in their own right. Honestly downright hilarious. They're just VERY difficult dogs. It takes someone who has a lot of experience training dogs and owning them to really effectively own a shiba and keep them in line. Intelligent independent-minded breeds are notoriously difficult and require a great deal of consistency (which can be more difficult with kids in the picture). On top of that, most shibas take a while to warm up to people, so fostering them might actually be even harder than just trying to *own* one. The upside is, when they finally melt and turn sweet (we called him ""candied Leo"" when he became much more chillax with being manhandled and loved), they're *really* big babies and they loooooooooooove affection.


They're fantastic dogs, you just definitely need to be ALL ABOUT shibas to really enjoy owning them. My sister wound up going with a corgi when she got a puppy instead of a shiba like she'd been planning, and she is so glad she did the corgi instead because they're just a billion times easier to own and train. Way less picky, super social, very little caution, and they actually like water/grooming.


I HIGHLY encourage fostering, though, even if it's not shibas! It's a huge part in getting dogs cared for, rehabilitated, and homed. :)",1519862579

Start sponsoring people, make the NRA look like good, reasonable people.

The facts on are the pro-gun rights side.  Ads should show the facts, call out the gun-controls sides lies (looking at Bloomberg's groups and that ""mass shooting tracker"" specifically), with reasonable, every day people explaining these things in a factual, non-combative way.  Putting out dramatic, us vs them ads just fuels the fire and gives gun-control advocates ammunition to say ""see, I told you gun owners are unreasonable!""  It also keeps gun owners like myself who want to donate to the cause weary of joining because I don't know what the hell they're going to do next.

"computerscience","t5_2qj8o","In my experience, the one thing that matters most is how much time you invest. While it is possible to waste lots of time on 'studying', I've not seen anyone excel without putting the effort in. (Some people hide it quite well, though.) Some more specific recommendations:

* Go to lectures. (unless they suck, you already know the material in advance, and you have confirmed both personally with a number of data points. If in doubt—or first year—go there. If the lecture is at an inconvenient place or time, always go, to prevent any temptation. If it is convenient, then why would you not go?) Lectures are a great way to learn things without much effort, apart from paying attention. (Which is sometimes admittedly difficult.) I find I can understand the material much more quickly in independent study, but it takes a lot more effort and having the routine is invaluable. I takes notes only when the provided slides are not complete, so almost never, as I have found it to be easier to pay attention when I'm otherwise unoccupied. However, your experience may vary, and lots of people (perhaps even a majority) find it easier to focus when taking notes.
* Don't be content with not understanding something. Things become easy once you understand them. If you feel confused about something, or that you have sort-of understood it, there is work left to do. Time spent clearing up misunderstandings is almost always invested well. Finding the things you don't understand is difficult, but that leads us to the next point:
* Do the exercises. In particular in theoretical subjects. If there is mandatory homework, count yourself lucky. If there is optional homework, treat it as mandatory. I cannot stress this point enough: Exercises show you the areas you may not have understood as well as you thought. They solidify abstract concepts, putting them into context. And, most importantly, they improve your skills. Want to become good at abstract thinking? Practice. Want to get better at programming? Practice. Want to smugly tell your fellow students how you aced the test? Guess what, I spent two weeks perfecting that arrogant sneer in my bathroom. (I may or may not be entirely serious about that.)
* Be curious. Don't be afraid to ask 'Why isn't this done like that?' or 'Is that minus wrong?' or 'What happens if we write 2[a] instead of a[2] (in C)?' Try to find new way to do things. Maybe find a different proof for some theorem, or a completely different algorithm for some problem, or another way to look at some data. (Sometimes there are exercises of the form 'Prove A. *Hint:* You can use B.' You bet that the first thing I try is proving A without mentioning B at all.) Be critical: Slides often contain a few errors, lectures even more. Finding them is a great sport, and lecturers are always thankful when you point out that a lemma fails in the completely irrelevant case of n=0.
* Don't despair if something seems really hard. Very often I see students struggling with maths (and/or theoretical CS). Some get excellent grades regardless, because of sheer persistence.  I'm often being confronted with difficult problems, where I don't feel like having made any progress after thinking about them for hours. (Literally.) Still, most problems break if you mash your head against them long enough. (Once, I failed to come up with anything for a whole weekend. At just an hour before the deadline I finally managed to break through—the final proof was one line and I felt quite stupid. Worth it.) You also get a lot better at this with practice, developing a larger, more robust forehead.
* This one is specific, but not really limited, to CS: Learn programming. This is not a binary measure; you can always improve. I believe that being a competent programmer is a huge asset in almost any academic field (and obviously the industry as well). Sadly, many universities do not put much effort into this, offering only basic introductions and some extremely high level software engineering. Consequently, the people I have met that know their way around code have done that in self-study. Also, the average CS student is—at best—mediocre. A lot of time that can be sunk into this. Again, I advise to try out a lot of different things: Dynamic languages (e.g. Python); low-level languages (C, C++); weird languages (e.g. Prolog, SML); crazy languages (PHP, JavaScript); OOP; not OOP; embedded systems; The Cloud; abstracting common functionality into functions; CTRL-C CTRL-V *everything*!; call the OS directly; write your own compiler; emojis as variable names, etc. Get a feeling for when what works, and why. *Don't be content with not understanding something.*
* Exercise regularly. And by that I mean physical activity. Stamina helps a lot when staying up all night to finish before a deadline.
* Don't do all-nighters. Trust me on this one.

That's more or less what I do. For me, it works out well. Obviously, you have to set your own priorities, find the things that interest you, and choose how much time and effort you are willing to spent on your studies.",1519862581

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","Sure. We don't have too much info on sengoku, but I said that based on the fact that 

1) He's old and past his prime. This definitely hurts his fighting ability, look at Whitebeard and how age affected him.
2) Luffy was able to take some hits from Sengoku on the execution platform without sustaining too much damage, including a shockwave attack and a punch in his buddha form. This is pre timeskip luffy who was extremely exhausted and beaten up already. Even if luffy has a rubber body that can absorb shockwaves, sengoku can definitely use haki and should have been able to hurt luffy anyways. Luffy took massive damage from every other Admiral when they attacked him, so I see a difference between Sengoku and the other admirals. 

That being said, Sengoku is absolutely not weak and is still a monster, being right underneath the admirals and garp. He could beat any Yonko first commander that we've seen so far IMO. ",1519862583

It had its flaws, but one thing I've liked is how long it *feels*. I guess it relates to how long it actually is, but shit, it feels so long. When they finally make it out and find the car covered in leaves, I feel like it's taken months. Like, ""Oh yeah, the car. I remember now.""

Yes. There is a very specific point where you'll want to swap Yoshimo out. You'll know it when you see it.

&gt;Is there a point at which I need to only take a party of 5 so I have room to add someone without dropping someone from the party and losing them permanently, and if so can you vaguely advise me as to when I need to drop to 5?

No, that will not be necessary.

&gt;Not-very-related question: Should I pay the rescuers the money ASAP to save as many quests as possible for later in the game when I have my final team of 6 for xp purposes? Or do some quests become unavailable later anyway?

"highereducation","t5_2r04r","I think starting with a Master's and putting in several years working in the field is a good idea for Higher Education. It will give you a sense of what you do and don't want to do.  Going ""as high as you can"" in a university is pretty vague, and there are a lot of different job tracks within a university that you might pursue. After my Master's, I worked in what I thought (during undergrad) would be my ideal job, and found that the realities of that position weren't as I envisioned and that I was more drawn to academic research. That experience gave me a lot of perspective and experience that helped with my PhD research, too.

At least in the PhD programs that I am aware of, it is typically preferred that applicants have a Master's and/or some work experience in the field. It is possible you might get accepted into an EdD/PhD program right out of undergrad, but I'd encourage you to also think about focus and quality of the program you're applying to to ensure it aligns with your interests and goals. What types of jobs are program grads going into? EdD programs are more likely to be more practically/administratively-oriented and PhD programs tend to be more research-focused, though I know plenty of folks with PhDs in Higher Education who go into administrative positions too.",1519862586

***you are bad at presenting your ideas in an understandable, humble and non-confrontational way

physicke, heal thyself. i do admit to sometimes having difficulty distinguising between belligerent incomprehension and political hostility.

But my experiences with Monty Hall tell me that even otherwise intelligent people can be stubbornly stupid about even the simplest thing, so if i want someone to take up the reins of Swim - which i do - it is incumbent upon me to spell it out in words of one syllable just what the differences between GnuGo, Alfie and Swim (GAS) are, which i will put on the back of my todo list.


***Have you read Bill's analysis of your interaction with Fedya?
 
I'm not going to comment on Bill, other than to note he made an allusion to my banning via a ""happy Mardi Gras, haha"" post the day after i was banned, so he is crossed off my Christmas card list.  He does not, in my estimation, understand the concept of the value of Sente, which is an objective dispassionate topic worthy of serious study, as it affects everyone and every non-DCNN bot that plays Go. DCNN doesnt need to know about it, as it does just fine without knowing anything about Go other than a few knee-jerk reactions and a V8 engine faster than a Ferrari.

I note that John Fairbairn and a couple of others on L19 protested my banning; so i take this opportunity to express my appreciation to them, especially of John's sanguinity, particularly as he and i had a jocular exchange some while back.  His is a shining example of statesmanship that i commend you to to study with some attention.

On the other hand, Fedya is an unimaginative pen-name: it sounds like ""fed ya"", ie ""I fed you"", as in ""don't feed the trolls"".  i have noticed that one of the techniques of trolls is to call the people they are trolling trolls.  So whether fedya is a genuine racist or a troll pretending to be one i can't say - and frankly, my dear, i don't give a damn.  

But i do give a huge damn about real-life racism, ever since marching in Wolverhampton in a street demonstration against Enoch Powell's politics, ever since living in Northern Ireland where neighbours are not good friends, ever since a 14-year old boy was sent to prison for being downtown with a Pass (an incident recounted in My Go Study Journal http://lcipm.blogspot.com.au/2018/01/my-go-study-journal-1-preparing-ground.html), ever since working as a psychosocial support volunteer in a refugee camp during the Bosnia war, ever since seeing how Aborigines are still being treated in Australia by its present Government (thank you, John Pilger, for your documentary ""Utopia"" which opened my eyes to the appalling disinformation and criminality of John Howard's administration; i knew it was bad, but i hadn't known just how deep and how extensive and how bad its poison was until i saw John's movie).  i despair of man's inhumanity to man, and note with dismay that it is an inevitable outcome of evolution - even plants do it - so there is no hope for the future of mankind.

***how others perceive your behaviour.

how somebody perceives something is more a function of themselves than of the thing they are perceiving.  that's Psychology 101.  the assaults on me i see as a minor side-issue skirmish by camp followers of a longstanding war between neural net nutters and physical symbol hypothesis adherents that goes all the way back to Minsky's 1969 thesis, exacerbated by a recent upsurge in commercial interests of IBM, Goofle and a dozen others. DCNN has a future in pattern recognition, but it's no way the be-all and end-all of AI, even if Alfie0 is the best thing that has happened to Go for a hundred years.  You will see; time will tell.

"PaleMUA","t5_35iua","Hey! I dye my eyebrows and eyelashes myself, I do it about once a month and love it because it means I don't have to worry about colouring my brows in for ~3 weeks at a time (by the 4th week they start to be a little patchy so I colour them a bit with some brow mascara or a little bit of brown gel eyeliner), and I like doing my lashes too just to I look a little less like an alien when I'm not wearing makeup (I'm blonde, so my eyelashes and brows are pretty invisible naturally). I'm from New Zealand and I buy the '1000 Hour Eyelash &amp; Brow Dye Kit' in brown black - I'm not sure if this is available outside of NZ and Australia though? 

The only time I get irritation is if I put the dye on badly on my lashes and it gets in my eye - that stings like hell and you've got to flush it out straight away. The wands/spoolies that come in the packs are often pretty useless so I just keep an old mascara wand on hand to apply it better. I think irritation might also be more likely if you pluck your eyebrows before dying, just because it can get a little inflamed, but I haven't had that problem as I usually shape them after because the hairs are so much easier to see when they're dyed darker!

I'm sorry, I'm not sure about the eyelash waterline gap, I haven't noticed that when applying mascara before, but I would say it might still be an issue because you don't really want to apply the dye too close to the lash root in case it gets in your eye?

I've had then done professionally as well, but to be honest the dye job itself (once you get practised at it) is almost identical to what you get in the salon, however salons often do a far better job than me at plucking and shaping them. When dying your lashes yourself you (obviously) have to keep your eyes open, but at the salon you keep them closed, so maybe the eyelash gap might not be as bad because you can go closer to the root when your eyes are closed?

TL;DR: I love it and dye mine regularly, it's great to cut out a step in makeup application plus it's super easy for those days when you just want to chuck on some concealer and run out the door.",1519862588

"Eve","t5_2qil9","Developing trust takes time.  It also takes risking trusting others.  The trick is to keep the risk to a comfortable level for both parties.

I recently loaned a corpmate a freighter.  He returned it.  That's how trust grows.

I loaned a corpmate a set of BPOs, and he had them for an awfully long time.  When I asked for them back, he returned them promptly.  So I bought and researched a set for his own personal use.  No charge.  I rewarded his trustworthy behaviour.

I am completely trustworthy, and always try to be helpful, even when it is inconvenient for me.  I am not impressed with any amount of ISK nor any items, and value my reputation the most.

However, I'm quite paranoid myself, and don't easily trust others.

One person I completely trust in EVE also completely trusts me, though he has vastly more to lose than I do.  I've never met him in real-life.  I have played other online games with both him and his wife.  I probably message him almost daily, and we don't only discuss EVE, but also life, family, etc.

He trusts me enough that he made me CEO of his alt corp, with trillions of his assets in corp hangars.  I'm also a director in his structure holding-corp ... only reason not CEO of that corp is because I don't like creating corps (I hate making corp logos).

We've known each other online since about 2009.  He trusted me first by letting me use his hisec POS (back when the number of jobs you could do in a POS or station were limited, so there were month-long or worse queues in hisec stations, and risking travelling to NPC nulsec to do research was often the only solution).

The nulsec corp I'm in is also trusting me.  I've access to over 50 billion ISK in a corp-project wallet and hangar, plus I recently got a 2nd promotion on my 1 year anniversary which gives me access to some corp ship hangars.

The more I'm trusted, the more I can reward that trust by helping or contributing more.",1519862588

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","Among other things:

- Feminism can be racist as hell towards men of color. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a premier first-wave feminist, said that women's suffrage would galvanize white supremacy. Hollaback! once ran a video where a female subject walked through one small block of New York in a heavily colored neighborhood. The finished product was black men hollering at the woman for hours on end. This did two things: one, it emboldened white supremacists and two, it made it easy for conservatives to call out the racism inherent to the video.

- Feminism oftentimes cheapens men's issues by making them subordinate to women's issues or suggesting that they are a shadow of women's issues, rather than just another side of the same coin.

- Feminism doesn't talk enough about the glass basement, i.e the glass floor that protects women from having to do the worst aspects of society. This is entirely due to misogynistic stereotypes, but it explains why men are maimed at work more often, are homeless more often or die more in wars.",1519862588

You can play with up to 3 other players in multiplayer. Each one can have its own character each with their own perks to unlock. Depending on perks, player's ability and group, each mission can be completed in various ways. You can go shooting without thinking much or you can complete missions in full stealth.

The game has many missions, characters and things to unlock ( masks in particular ), so, there is no lack of content. And there is a Discord formed here at this Reddit where you can find players to play with, if you don't have friends to.",1519862589

What I'm getting at is that if the business owner has the moral right to start a business that employs people, or not, wind up a business that results in loss of employment, or not, then the business owner doesn't seem, at least to me, to 'owe' the worker the responsibility to keep the worker out of poverty.

This will assign the asset a fake user and therefor, the memory manager thinking that something is using the asset, will not delete it.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I see this game evolving like EVE online. As a disclaimer I've never played EVE, too much if a learning curve, but I do keep up with large scale community events. Some of which I can see happening in SC. EVE is great for a lot of people because it has politics. Basically the game has been going so long that Organizations were able to literally become massive and take over sections of space. These Orgs eventually amassed a fortune and used this money to buy more ships for their fleets, Org bases, etc. 

(For anyone in this battle, I don't remember much as it was a while ago. So don't expect my numbers and exact story to be correct. This is just the gist of what happened as an example for this post. )

Alliances were made and there was essentially peace in the universe. However, the player run politics in the game chose not to have peace. Eventually a massive war is broken out and the universe is divided into two. This has happened a number of times, but the one I remember most ended up costing about 11 trillion in game cash. It was insane, there was so much going on the game server dropped to basically -20 fps just to keep track of all the player attacks. There were thousands of players. Massive fleets of different orgs all meeting up for tactical battles. 

What was so cool about this was that it basically started off some petty argument between two people, which grew two two Orgs conflicted (who were like the top ranked orgs in the game ) and then it just dominoed until everyone was involved. 

There was another situation when one Org Leader stole all the money from his Org and transferred it to another Org and joined them. It was probably the shiestiest thing I've ever seen. Thousands of players were left ass broke on the street when they were considered wealthy just hours ago. Their whole Org immediately crumbled. 

I don't remember what happened after that, but that's the point I'm trying to make. Content will get us plenty far, but what's going to keep people coming back will be the interactions between other players. 

Think about it. We already have massive ships in the works for nearly 100 players to play together. We have Orgs in the thousands of members, to even 100's of thousands. May the Auroras block out the sun, as they say. Then we get player made Outpost, as many as they want.

2) Neymar was instrumental in the comeback. Don't downplay it. He was virtually responsible for every goal in that comeback. While others contributed, that 6-1 thrashing had Neymar's signature all over it.

3) I suggest you re-watch the game again. Neymar clearly created that easy opportunity. That goal doesn't happen without Neymar no matter how hard you try to dispute it. Funny how you neglect Neymar's 2 other crosses that were right on the money but weren't converted because of poor awareness and finishing by his teammates. Mbappe was a ghost and Cavini was a nonfactor. The only threat PSG had on that day was Neymar.

"computerscience","t5_2qj8o","I think the concepts are more intuitive than perhaps you were taught. If they were presented to you as a list of  “you’ll need all these” formulas, then yeah that’d be confusing.

I’m my experience from tutoring people is that most people don’t have a strong number sense, which is when you can quickly/intuitively sanity check whether a calculation seems right. Like when you compute an answer in radians and get 105... you should understand why that answer is very very likely to be wrong because you have a sense for what radians are. 

For instance, when you see an arc-tan, the first thing you should do to strengthen your understanding (if you feel a little shaky) is to draw a triangle and draw what arc-tan means. “What angle will give me a tangent of this value?” Draw the angle and the sides of the triangle (use x as the “opposite” side and 1 as the “adjacent” side, since the ratio x/1 gives you that angle). That picture in your head is key!

And if you don’t feel comfortable with sin/cos/tan (none of that SOH CAH TOA nonsense), you should read up on the unit circle. If you understand that, everything else gets a lot clearer.

As for derivatives of trig functions, again that is intuitive. When sin and cos are in their Taylor series, their derivatives are so clear. For tan, write it as sin/cos and do then quotient rule! 

For arc-cos, do that trick above where you draw the triangle and label sides with x and 1 (in accordance with what cosine means, ratio-wise) and then solve for the third side in terms of x. Write down cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(1 - x^2 ) because of the definition of cos as the ratio of two sides. Take the derivative w.r.t. x, which means you will use the chain rule for cos(theta). Follow the rest of these steps, and you’ll have the derivative of arc-cos in no time.

Do each of these exercises and more. Develop your number sense. And everything will be much more clear, and actually kinda fun!! :)",1519862595

Think about it otherwise it would be a very stupid suicidal move. If only Bell would abide by this sort of law they would lose their clients quite fast to their competitors on the same network.

There's thousands of successful defensive gun uses every year. They're not all being done by ex-special forces commandos. 

Heck, the level of training you're describing - we don't even provide that to police And we not only let police choose to carry guns if they want to, we buy and issue guns to them. If we went by your standard for gun ownership/carrying, a whole lot more people than teachers would be unqualified - cops, bank/armored car guards, bodyguards for politicians outside the line of presidential succession (ie, non-Secret Service), park rangers, and bail collection agents (bounty hunters) should all disarm.

Character Details: Gelmarr Sharp - Clever, Covert (e), Navigator, Tactician

What is Happening?: Sharp's at Tall Trees Town. He's walking around. He wants to learn some stuff. 

What I Want: 

* Sharp's walking around. He wants to establish some familiarity with the physical location. Does that work? 

* While he's walking around, Sharp's going to keep an eye open and see if he spots any defenders. Last time he went sauntering around a Summer Islander town (Last Lament, in that case), he saw a bunch of [mooks with bows and paint on their faces](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/79e9zb/last_call_in_last_lament/dp3nw75/?context=3). Are any of them around? If not, what sort of guards or defenses does the town appear to have? 

* Sharp wants to meet with the representatives of House Zhaqu that rule the town. Since he was part of the Ironborn task force and commanded part of the fleet during part of the Port Lotus engagement, he may be known to them. 

In the event it has any bearing, please note that Sharp has level 2 spy rings in each of the three Summer Islander settlements on Walano. ",1519862598

They didn't force you to play with them or many other of the little tweaks they had. Purely optional. 

I tend to agree, permenant alliances were painful when they were teaming up on you, but honestly at least he AI put up a challenge through it, and at least if you followed the fairly intuitive diplomacy you could have your pick of a permanent ally.  

The amenity system is okay. There are two huge problems with it:

1. Most unhappiness is global across your empire. 

2. You can't distribute your global amenities.

It's a very dumbed down system, and whenever they dumb something down you are losing some control and detail in the process. 

It makes more sense when your core cities are happier than can be, *literally. Celebrating your rule*, while cities you just captures, cities that have been abused or on the border, or whatever are less happy. They've removed most city center buildings and exported them all to themed districts...

Okay. 

It's cool to an extent. It's nice having an entertainment complex that provides happiness to several cities, but it's still pretty lame that I have to buff the city's production first through among other things building a dedicated production district and focusing production buildings there, then move on to the specialization of the city. 

And the problem with it is *I* and most other human players can handle it pretty well, but the AI completely drops the ball on it and can't do either... it can't build good cities period, and it definitely can't build multi-city systems that work well together. When you could build most building chains in any city the AI was quicker to address its own problems and as a player you didn't have to pick and choose... ultimately you could build any city up to be a very good city, *you had to prioritize your immediate needs first*, but by the end you had a balanced city and could essentially use it however you wanted.

Everything, as it turns out. Well, not everything--I didn't drown. I have a vague memory of drifting ashore and being surrounded by a goup of Nepali soldiers. After watching me for a while, as I ogled them over the gunwale like a lunatic, they seemed of the verge of deciding what to do with me. Some polite words of Esperanto and a few mad oar strokes, and I was offshore and into oblivion. I suppose *that* could have ended differently. But soon there was no lake or mountains or boat--and if I had fallen into the water, I am pretty sure there would have been no one to swim. For the next several hours my mind became a perfect instrument of self-torture. All that remained was a continuous shattering and terror for which I have no words.""",1519862600

If it wasn't for my situation I wouldn't even bother with online dating but that's about all I have for now since I'm still sort of new in my city.

I've mainly tried tinder only because that seems to be the only dating app /site where 5% of your matches will actually respond to you. Which isn't saying much at all. Even the ones that do respond, or even more rare, send the first message almost always end up ghosting for no rhyme or reason after seeming totally interested. Seems like I'm always the one asking the questions, making the comments, and trying to breathe life into the conversation but often to no avail. I would think they'd at least ask if I've been to jail or something but nope. I get matches somewhat regularly but never seem to get any more interest than a ""like"". I don't see how relationships even happen at all with all of the games people play. It's like you just have to be cool and aloof while somehow showing enough interest to move things forward. 

Another thing that I'll never understand is that men are expected to approach, lead the interaction, make the first moves towards intimacy, etc. when we're also the potential psycho/rapist/creeps by default. Women are the ones that have to get comfortable with the idea of moving things forward and guys just have to play the guessing game when women are less likely to be rejected since guys are less picky.

I was intrigued about how moving files around on my desktop translated to actions in your creator's game; on the other hand, I would have appreciated if you'd picked everything up before you left.

-- Brandon

P.S. I was caught off-guard when Wally knew my name-- that was a good intro to the game! I like the uniqueness of searching folders and moving files around to perform in-game actions. I especially like how it was tied into the conversation-- Wally can't get into the basement, so I ""hack"" things and retrieve what he's looking for. At the same time, it made me a little uncomfortable seeing files created on my desktop-- it was definitely unexpected and kinda cool, but for me, I think the discomfort outweighs those feelings. Maybe you could virtualize the environment and have events not actually take place in folders people normally use. All in all, I think it's a unique experience.

Psychology is the science of behavior and mind, including conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope and diverse interests that, when taken together, seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of epiphenomena they manifest. As a social science it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.

In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist.

Your loadout just simply makes no sense. I understand you claim you have mid-to-long range locked down, but you're simply wrong at that. Also pretty telling you refuse to provide proof of your stats... lol. People will just spray you down at the mid range where the Vector isn't good enough and the VSS is too inconsistent. 

You also aren't winning consistently if you're only top 2%. I also know how to use both weapons, hence why I never claimed they were bad weapons. For squad play you are also HEAVILY overvaluing suppressed weapon as you can't count on your entire squad to have one (which I've already stated), and the mid-long range weapons (ARs) are relatively easy to hear from a distance with suppressed anyway. At least a distance that matters to you.

It's also pretty telling that literally everyone who's just slightly decent in the current tournament picks up 556 ARs over literally every other weapon. Shroud (which you mentioned) even didn't give a shit as he passed a VSS, nor did he at any point switch to his secondary Vector as he were in close-to-mid range fights, where your entire loadout would've been terrible.

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","**TLDR: The Wakanda the UN knows is a FRONT to keep the REAL Wakanda safe. This is stated in the movie.**

&gt; It had a fake mountain that made it look it was rugged terrain with no big cities

....Did you watch the movie?

Wakanda is a known as a country to the world. However, everyone thinks Wakanda is a poor farmland. The REAL Wakanda is hidden through a cloaking device somewhere in the area. The mountain ranges don't hide it alone. It’s hidden via technology. A plane could fly right over Wakanda and not see it. Not because of mountains. 

A literal cloaking device hides it. We see them bypass the cloaking twice in the film (the white character whose name I forgot had to shoot down the ships before they could bypass it and when we FIRST see Wakanda, we see it by the characters flying through the cloaking device). You cant just visit Wakanda. Its not found on any maps.

No one knows about the REAL Wakanda. Did you see the cutscene. Its a perfect illustration, when the politicians asked what the Wakandans possibly have to offer the world given they are nothing but farmers, and T'Challa simply smiles.

&gt; The countries which border Wakanda don't know where their borders end

No. There is a Wakanda. THAT Wakanda just isn't the REAL Wakanda. The movie made that very clear. ANYONE can visit Wakanda, the poor country. No one can visit the actual, technologically advanced Wakanda.

&gt; In various earlier movies, characters have been to Wakanda

No. They had been to Fake-Wakanda. Think of it like this. There is a house on the end of a street. Inside the house is a mansion. You know where the house is located. You have no way to access the mansion inside because its hidden. NO ONE HAD BEEN TO THE REAL WAKANDA EXCEPT FOR CLAW.

Killmonger may have a map, but he still cannot access it without being allowed in.

&gt; This idea that no one knows that a member country of the UN exists is insane. 

Again: Everyone knows there is a country called Wakanda. No one knows that there is a freaking technologically advanced country called Wakanda because its hidden.

If nothing else, the cutscene ALONE verifies this. The UN doesn't know what Wakanda really is.

&gt; So, Black Panther was on ice for 20 years while the entire population of Wakanda built millions and millions of weapons which were just then being shipped out to the spies? That makes no sense either. Killmonger is in charge of Wakanda for less than a week.

What are you talking about? The weapons are so powerful because of the vibranium. Claw wants more vibranium because of its advanced capabilities. Having and sending out the weapons already made is one thing, but its the vibranium that makes it all mean something.

Killmonger doesn't need ""enough"" weapons. He needs the access to CREATE as many weapons as he wants. Wakanda has way more vibranium than humans will probably be able to use in our entire existence.

Avoid anything that clashes with your skin tone.  You don't want to go with something too similar to your skin, but you don't want colors that flatten your tone and make you look sickly.

For example, greens and yellows are not for you.  But you can get away with some vibrant colors.  If you go with reds, stay on the pink side.  if you go with blue, stay on the purple side.

I personally suggest that if you go vibrant, go matte.  If you go neutral, do shimmer.",1519862606

Assuming you are playing canto/hk rules since we are in the gz sub, that means 13 tile mahjong. 

1) You start out by rolling the rice to see who starts (起庄) and stacking 18 duo tile decks in front of you ( 19 for the 庄家 and the player seated opposite the 庄家 if you are playing south east Asian rules).

2) Then the starter will roll the dice to see where he/she starts to take the tiles from ( the stack to the left of the tiles taken will be the pool from which the players take from to replenish their tile from a Kong or flower or animal(south east Asia))

3) the players then take 4 tiles in clockwise rotation 3 times and the starter then take 2 top tiles on the first and third duo (for a total of 14 tiles) while the remaining players then proceed to take a single tile from the tile deck (for a total of 13 tiles) tile deck should be left with a single bottom tile joined with the rest of the tiles

4) starter then play a tile (now left with 13 tiles) and the player seated  immediately clockwise can either chow (if tile are a straight flush) pung (3 of a kind) or Kong (4 of a kind). If Kong, he must replenish a tile from the Kong/flower tile deck or forfeit his chances of winning (小上公) and depending on table rules maybe responsible for paying out the winnings for the other players if a player wins on his discard. Other players may pung and kung on any discard whilst chow must be from the discard from the player seated immediately anticlockwise to you.

In the original timeline Ethiopia requested military aid from the Portuguese, which they agreed to in the form of a few ships in the red sea. Lets say that Portugal provides more aid than that, whether it be from the prestige in aiding the mythical Prester John in battle or just because having a Christian ally to the south of the Ottomans is a good idea. With Portuguese help the Ethiopians crush the Adal sultanate and annex them, giving Ethiopia a sizable coast on the red sea. With aid from western European powers eager for trade and prestige I could see the Ethiopians conquering the rest of the horn of Africa easily. 

Now this gives some problems for Ethiopia, namely the fact that all the land they just grabbed is Muslim, and the ruling Solomonic dynasty is Christian. Through trade and religious contact with Spain they get the wonderful idea of having their own Inquisition. So they form the Ethiopian Inquisition and start mass converting the former Islamic land (and the Ethiopian jews for good measure.) This would likely start a massive civil war since this would be on a much bigger scale than the Spanish Inquisition. But lets say the war is won and the land is properly converted. Congratulations Ethiopia now has a religiously homogeneous society and a large coastline. It's also basically a western European puppet state that has no control over certain coastal cities, giving them up to European traders ala Hong Kong.

Now to become a prosperous first world nation (in the commonly understood meaning of the term, not the traditional cold war definition) Ethiopia would require an Alexander II type figure, a reformer obsessed with catching up to Western Europe. so lets say in the early 19th century we get one, a leader who frees the slave, reforms the Ethiopian military away from its Feudal system of peasant levies, and creates an entirely new legislative and judicial system. So now all this guy has to do is to recapture the tradpost cities that the Europeans have captured, this would likely result in a few wars, or Ethiopia could buy the cities back from struggling wartorn European powers, ala the Louisiana purchase. .",1519862608
"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","I have an ultimaker extended 2+.  I get clogs every now and then and here's how I fix them.

OPTION 1
- I'd just run the filament through for about five minutes (or until it stops curling up)

OPTION 2
- Heat the print nozzle to about 230 degrees and push filament through

- then, cool the print nozzle to about 80 or 90 degrees and pull (HARD) on the filament where it enters from the top so it pops out.  this works 90% of the time.

OPTION 3
- You may just have a nozzle that needs to be replaced.  If you're using composite filament they tend to wear down nozzles.  If you find yourself going through nozzles frequently you may want to invest in a ruby-tipped nozzle. They are pricey ($100) but i've been using mine for three years now.

Of course, this is if your problem is being caused by your print head.  If you are saying that the filament curls up while printing then you need to raise your print bed higher. 

I'd get my print bed dialed in by raising all the screws up and starting a print that is a large square or one that will cover most of the print bed.  Then I slowly lower each corner of the print bed as it prints, watching the filament go down.  Just raise it to the point where no filament comes out (because the bed is too high) and slowly lower it until filament starts to stick.  do that until it can do the whole square and you should be good to go.


good luck!",1519862608

"flying","t5_2qm1t","&gt; GEOFS is nothing more than a video game. The thought that I could go vertical in an A380, and than easily stabilize the plane is a fabrication.

I wouldn't say it's a 'video game'. It's not 100% of course but it's far from an arcade game. It is possible to recover from a vertical dive.

* http://mentalfloss.com/article/58517/first-commercial-jet-break-sound-barrier-was-not-concorde

Of course machines all have limits and most aircraft aren't built for sustained dives. But it's not insta-death either. Even a engine loss isn't immediate death as some movies would have you believe. 

I'd keep at the flying lessons, it's a valuable experience even though it doesn't totally remove the fear. A healthy dose of fear is what keeps us safe. Everything in aviation is much more controlled and like they say it's not the flying, it's the drive to the airport that will get you. ",1519862609

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Not OP, but doing research on persuasion and white supremacy. I can share my hypotheses with with you based on my research. I would say the first and most important thing is to figure out is your dad's motivation.


*   Does he truly believe whites are superior?
*   Does he want segregation?
*   Does he feel like whites are getting shafted by laws and social policies, e.g. affirmative action?


If it's either of the first two, your task will be trickier, but not impossible. I would suggest asking a series of ""why"" and ""how"" questions. ""Did something happen that made you feel you were treated unfairly? Were other people also treated that way? Why do you think they treated you like that? Was it in response to something? Does it still happen? What did you do in response? Why did you do it? How effective do you think your reaction was?""


Show genuine curiosity. Tell him you want to understand his philosophy better, that you want to get to know him better, or whatever you need to say to get him to open up. DO NOT tell him you are asking him these questions because you want to get him out of the Klan, or he is likely to shut down and get angry. Do not get emotional. If you feel yourself getting upset (which is TOTALLY FINE), excuse yourself, do something you enjoy, and sleep on it. Keep in mind that being effective is more important than being right, and that this process will be difficult, and you won't be effective if you don't take care of yourself first.


Once you know his motivation, you can start presenting him with examples and evidence. Keep these principles in mind.

*  1. The most effective persuasion happens when people don't know they are being persuaded.
*  2. Talk about micro examples, not macro ideas. Don't talk about lynchings in general, talk about a specific example like [this](https://www.thenation.com/article/lynching-university-maryland-campus/). Don't call it a lynching.
*  3. Talk about concrete policies like [Redlining.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/) Don't send him the article. Do your own research and explain the policy to him.
*  4. Present the evidence, and let him come to his own conclusions based on the evidence. For example, you don't need to say that Redlining created segregation. If you tell him how it worked, he will likely come to that conclusion on his own.
*  5. Do not label him. Do not call him a racist because that will likely piss him off and paint you as the enemy. Do not call him a Klansman because that reinforces his identity as a group member, and will make it harder for him to leave. 
*  6. This may be obvious, but don't use anything that can be considered a liberal buzzword. For the love of god, don't mention white privilege.

Maybe OP u/shamethrowaway77 can comment on the veracity of some of these techniques. I sincerely hope they work for you. Feel free to PM me if you want me to point you in the direction of other articles or books with more info.

Also, Robert Cialdini has a great book called [Pre-suasion](https://www.amazon.com/Pre-Suasion-Revolutionary-Way-Influence-Persuade-ebook/dp/B01C36E2YS), where he talks about setting the stage for effectively persuading people. It's written for a non-academic audience and is entertaining, and explains how to apply persuasive principles in real life.

There is cancellation of removal - a discretionary option for non citizens in removal proceedings with 10 years of continuous presence in the US, asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the convention against torture. There are also the U Visa (crime victims), T Visa (trafficking victims), and VAWA (DV victims). Being undocumented does not always mean immediate removal from the country if you qualify for certain types of immigration relief. 

All but the Convention Against Torture take criminal history into account and even permit immigration relief with certain criminal convictions that are not deemed to serious. 

That is why just using the blanket terms criminal is misleading. You must look at what the crime is, when it was committed, sentencing, etc. For example, drug possession can be a misdemeanor and a removable offense. Driving more than 20 mph over the speed limit can be a felony and not a removable offense.

I would think labor shortage should factor in. Many employment visas require the employer to demonstrate that no US Citizen or LPR could fill a particular role. This points to the government taking an active role in filling jobs.  For low-skilled jobs, I don't think the solution is to keep undocumented workers in those positions, but immigration reform should address this issue either through temporary low-skilled work visas (more of which existed in the past) or opportunities to gain permanent residence. 

Another reason people should not be deported is that some will be killed if sent to their country of origin. Currently, asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief are all high bars. Someone can easily lose an asylum case and yet still be killed within a week of returning to their home country. 

I'm not under the illusion that the US will do away with deportation/removal, but there are reasons to consider for not deporting people. These reasons are not going to change the ways deportations currently happen, but they point to need for immigration reform. Immigration reform could get at some of the root causes of why people choose to come to the US unlawfully. ",1519862611

That's just not true, though.  Massive genocides are at least generational, if not more frequent.  The Holocaust wasn't an isolated occurrence.  It wasn't a fluke.

Well like I said the piece about receiving praise was only a guess, and it is just as likely your attempt to garner praise failed as it is my guess was wrong.

The fact that they were then betrayed and rounded up by the Stalin-supported party (there were a LOT of Socialist parties in Spain at the time, Orwell was part of a Trotskyist militia) because Stalin told them to prevent revolution and protect the ""Bourgeoisie Republic"" so they wouldn't scare the Western powers, that led Orwell to hate Stalinism so much and refer to the USSR as ""Right Socialists,"" because they would rather have the Capitalists back in charge than a popularly supported non-Stalinist-puppet Socialist regime.

&gt; It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workman. Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been collectivised;
even the bootblacks had been collectivized and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the
face and treated you as an equal. Servile and even ceremonial forms of speech had temporarily disappeared. Nobody said
'Sen~or' or 'Don' ort even 'Usted'; everyone called everyone else 'Comrade' or 'Thou', and said 'Salud!' instead of 'Buenos
dias'. Tipping had been forbidden by law since the time of Primo de Rivera; almost my first experience was receiving a lecture
from a hotel manager for trying to tip a lift-boy. There were no private motor-cars, they had all been commandeered, and the
trams and taxis and much of the other transport were painted red and black. The revolutionary posters were everywhere,
flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues that made the few remaining advertisements look like daubs of mud. Down the
Ramblas, the wide central artery of the town where crowds of people streamed constantly to and fro, the loud-speakers were
bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night. And it was the aspect of the crowds that was the queerest thing of
all. In outward appearance it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a small
number of women and foreigners there were no 'well-dressed' people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-class
clothes, or blue overalls or some variant of militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in this that I did not
understand, in some ways I did not not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for.

"cpp","t5_2qi27","Back in the day with Delphi (Pascal) I abused this sort of thing by adding checks in methods for `self` (the `this` equivalent) being null. 

This allowed neat tricks like creating an immutable `List` class where a null pointer of type List would act exactly like an empty list. This way, a reference to a `List` was always a valid working reference even if it was null. You could call methods on the reference to check the list size, which would just return `0` if `self` was null, or methods to add a new element, which would return a new `List` object containing that element. The class would have all non-virtual methods, and be marked as ""sealed"" so that no other classes could descend from it.

I don't recall if this was considered undefined behaviour in Delphi, but obviously it was a terrible hack regardless.",1519862621

Those who do this not only permanently fuck up someone's life, if successful, but insult and belittle genuine victims of such tragedies.  This especially concerning because the statue limitations for rape charges were extended in Florida and may be outright eliminated in California.  Rape is a serious matter, and it sickens me to think that some crazy, immoral bitch could have the freedom to press rape charges on her law-abiding ex-boyfriend simply because she doesn't like him.  After all, no one seems to think it's possible for a woman to abuse a man.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My mom's mom didn't love her or her sisters like a mom should. As a result of this, my mom has quite a few emotional issues and hasn't always been the most emotionally stable person. 

I remember growing up, she always reminded me how much she gave up to have me. She chose to put me in a catholic school and made public school sound horrible to the point I was afraid to go to public school. Then she used that as a threat. If I didn't get specific grades or do certain clubs or sports then I was threatened with public school. And I got to hear how they could have afforded another luxury car if they didn't have to pay for school. It always seemed that she focused on how much it cost her and dad to have and support me. And how much work it was to raise me and therefore I owe them. 

Like she expected a 5 year old me to clean up after myself.  Like she holds it against me that as a little kid, I would get home from school and drop everything by the front door so I could play. That's normal kid behavior. 

And now she doesn't understand how I could think that she didn't want to have me or kids in general. I mean, yeah. That's what happens when you tell your 12 year old that she is a selfish bitch for not anticipating your feelings. Or when you make everything about how much money/time/etc it took to raise a child. 

Heck, I'm only just starting to get a handle on my own issues through therapy but I've been dealing with their issues for as long as I can remember. I've been a nurse, therapist, marriage counselor, and maid for them for as long as I can remember. It is not my job and never should have been my job but it's so hard to separate myself from it all.

I should also mention at the risk of sounding arogant, that I am very well positioned ""politically""(?) as well. My manager has given me nothing but praise since I finished onboarding and I have a great rapport with the senior execs in my office.

I was actually asked to present at a sales work shop we held at headquarters 2 weeks ago and it went really well. I was presenting on the BDR program for other regions as well as the results I accomplished in Q4.

It wasnt inaction, it was seeing if young quarterbacks would step up, they didnt.  

kaep and romo's situation was nothing like cousin's.  Romo was done, and kaep is a wildcat qb.  Kirk is the best available free agent qb since manning, and hell he better than manning as a FA prospect since we didnt even know if manning would be able to throw.  Before that it was Brees and his resume was shit in SD.

Entire legitimacy of current Chinese government solely depends on economic progress, and so even with a strong man as leader, you can expect much of the focus of the government will still be on the economy. Granted, the right spectrum of the ccp (Capitalists) have all been removed by the left leaning (Pro-Mao Ideas) officials in power under the guise of anti-corruption campaign.

"instantpot","t5_31q4c","Sausage and lentil stew (in the IP) is one of the staple recipes around here. So I'll type out the general recipe below, or think I have a version in my Word files.  I use link sausage instead of loose ground sausage though, so you'd brown that with the onions or just microwave/it, etc, to add later like I do (I cut the sausages in quarters lengthwise, then crosswise to get ""bite-sized"" pieces...then lay them out on aluminum foil on a small baking tray and broil them in the toaster oven till beginning to brown).

Btw, lentils cook fairly quickly but veggies can get ""too soft"" if you want them al dente even at that time, so you could do this in two steps adding the non-onion veggies later or you could cut them in larger pieces.

This makes a good ""pantry meal"" too since I keep a pack of sausages and chicken stock in the freezer, and lentils and the mire poix ingredients around all the time. 

**lentil + sausage stew** (4)  
1 pkg of 4 sausages (I use Aidell's Chicken &amp; Apple or Artichoke Garlic, but any would work)  
1/2 pkg (or bit more) dried brown lentils  
oil (olive or avocado, etc...enough to cover pot bottom)  
1 lg onion, chopped  
few cloves garlic, chopped (optional)  
2 med carrots, sliced  
2 stalks celery plus leaves, sliced med thick  
1-2 bay leaves, depending on size  
few sprigs fresh thyme (or maybe 1 good teaspoon or more dry thyme leaves?)  
salt/pepper (hard to say how much; can add more at end if needed)  
chicken stock/broth + water (enough to cover all ingredients, but not more)  
sour cream (optional, but love what brings to taste)   
...cut each sausage lengthwise into quarters, then crosswise into bite-size pieces  
...lay out sausage pieces in one layer on foil on baking tray, then broil (I use toaster oven) till pieces nicely browned (keep aside; I chop veggies while broiling)  
...on Saute, heat oil then cook/stir chopped onion till translucent...add garlic partway thru if using  
...add at least 1 cup chicken stock/broth or water so onions/bottom won't scorch  
...add remaining ingredients except sour cream (carrots, celery, seasonings, lentils, browned sausages)  
...add enough stock and/or water to barely cover all ingredients  
...Manual 15-20 min; QR or can wait awhile if busy  
...puree some of the ingredients to thicken the stew (optional)...I use an immersion blender in one side of pot, but could remove some ingredients and put in a blender instead  
...ladle into bowls, but mix good dollop of sour cream (Daisy is my pref) into each bowl before serving

If Chicago is as hot a market as much of the country you can reasonably easily sell complete and total FSBO and pay 0% commission. If you need help guiding you through the process, with the paperwork or protecting your rights find yourself a good real estate lawyer for about $500.",1519862626

I am bisexual. I find that I just want to sleep with people I am deeply mentally compatible with, regardless of sex, and that I am not really attracted to people who don't connect on that mental level. I have felt attracted and connected to males and females at the same time, without comparison and without taking away from the other. I have felt torn, ended relationships because I was made to believe that I had to choose. Well, maybe with *them* I did, but I didn't realize not choosing was even an option.

I have been in hetero mono LTRs, and been physically faithful but emotionally unfaithful (hetero and homo), unaware that poly was a choice. First LTR finally ended after 8 years, after I asked to open up what had basically been a sexless and passionless companionate partnership. He said, when it ended, that he'd wished I'd taken up with someone else on the side all along, that it would have relieved the expectation of sex or thrill-seeking from him (I think in retrospect that he's asexual while I have a healthy libido and appetite for adventure - he wouldn't ever even sit on my motorcycles when keyed off!)

I thought it was just what I was looking for when I was invited into a closed poly triad with a hetero couple. While the sex was sort of satisfying, only one arm of the triad had developed naturally while the other arm was coercive. My experiment with the reality of this kind of poly has me doubting... 

however, in reading More Than Two, I am finding a description of the kind of relationship(s) I have longed for all along. Room for finding the beauty and joy in multiple people and being able to connect with them all on a physical level as well as a mental level. I don't want to fuck anymore.

To say he doesn't need them makes no sense as they were keeping him *alive.* Barry just got his powers and needed guidance, to train, to get better. And the scientists knew areas of science that Barry was either ignorant to or only dabbled in. It's the same reason they needed characters like Harry, Stein, Hartley, and Tracy to come in and contribute because they were experts in areas even the regular team scientists weren't. Probably at least half of what Barry can do is because of them, not himself.

It sounds like you are saying that Barry could just be like Devoe, know all areas of science, be the smartest man alive as well as the fastest. It actually makes sense he wouldn't know everything as he's focused on a very specific branch of science, forensics. The reason that **Iris** is forced is because there is not a single logical thing that explains her being in that lab all the time. Just being there to make out with Barry and order scientists to do science makes zero sense.

Now, on the part of being a *member* of GEO, from my conversation with a GEO member, I understand that while *all* TAs have to pay their 2% fair share because they benefit from the GEO-negotiated contract (cf. Illinois Public Labor Relations Act), that does not automatically make them members. They become members by filling and signing a form, and that is a voluntary act.

Edit:

So in critique, I'm actually really scared of this.  This is seriously overpowered.  If you toned down or changed a few things, it's actually really in line with typical progression, there's just a few things that push this way above other classes.  /u/Kankunation already covered basically what I would advise you on with an exception.

The Swordmage from 4e was a tank, wasn't it?  I'd focus on either defensive abilities or offensive ones, since that's probably what's causing this ""scattered and all over the place"" feel to it.  4e abilities were balanced around the number of uses you got out of things, so the effects could be much more potent than in what you see in 5e.  You'll also probably want to decide if this is a long rest or short rest class.  I wouldn't say everything is a short rest or long rest skill/ability, but deciding if it's more like warlock or wizard would definitely help you with your design concept, as well.",1519862633

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","It's safer to practice faith than magic.  You are correct that white magic exists.  The difficulty stems from the fact that magic is powerful, and power corrupts.  Or, more accurately, people often respond to increased power of their own by taking moral shortcuts or even fulfilling base desires, and thereby corrupt themselves.

I would say you've thought it halfway through when you write that TPTB ""try"" to use it for their own benefit.  If it were a waste of time, trying to advance that way would actually select against such a population of misguided magic believers.  But magic believers are not underrepresented as a population among TPTB.  On the contrary, the population fraction of magic believers among TPTB seems to be multiplied by a factor of 80.

The most obvious conclusion one can draw from that observation is that the magic believers are succeeding beyond expectations because belief in magic leads to an increase in power and influence.

Overskeptical pesudorationalists would assert that magic belief remains an insanity, and the power or influence gained due to magic belief is a social phenomenon.

A truly intelligent human would remain open-minded to the idea that magic might be scientifically true.  In that case, the easiest way to figure the situation is to study some white magic and see if it works.  

If you decide to see for yourself, I then recommend the path of Hatha Yoga, not just the third limb, the exercise for the body, but all 8 limbs or degrees.  Then read chapters 3 through 8 of the Gita, and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.  

Another path that is pretty safely white is Falun Gong.

IME, Wicca is too wild and dangerous.  And, as stated in the first sentence, a personal relationship with the living creator God is the best choice for any human, better and easier than white magic.",1519862633

&gt; I can think of one nurse that would have the know how.

I read that and I was like, he's not seriously fucking insinuating what I think he's insinuating. 

But then later you said,

&gt; We should discuss the ""Ninja"" Ryan theory, and how he could have easily mixed dried blood with his nursing kit blood to get a DNA profile on Steven Avery.

&gt; He's a smart boy.

And then I thought, wow, that's some rookie sleuthing. Because in addition to actually believing the Ninja Ryan theory, he believes it's even more likely because he assumes the ninja probably had access to fake blood which he surely had on him (along with a pipette) when he broke into Avery's home where there just happened to be blood in the sink which he not only stole, but then, according to you, mixed up into some kind of Avery Framing Cocktail and planted in the victim's vehicle (which he also planted further back in the yard) in less than 30 minutes then somehow managed to get a ride back to Hilbert. 

The basis of you claim is ""because Kathleen Zellner said so,"" and everything else is kind of fantastical. Like, ""seek help"" level fantastical. And even if this is something that could actually happen, you do realize that one doesn't have to be a nurse to get their hands on fake blood.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Here's the thing, it's a tragedy of the commons type deal. If the employer is allowed to hire non-union workers, then the employer can make a blanket policy where any union worker will be instantly fired. The problem is that the goals of the union are ensuring that workers are treated better and paid more. But that will always cut into corporate profits. Being better at negotiation changes nothing.

The reason unions were created was to give equal bargaining power to workers. A company can continue running with a few unfilled positions, a person cannot continue living without a job. A union means that the company cannot continue to exist unless they make an agreement with the union. Likewise, the union workers can't continue to live without their job. Both parties now have equal bargaining power.

Eliminating unions leads to worse conditions for workers. Look at any field that has de-unionized. Union garbage men are treated better than non-union garbage men. Same with teachers, firefighters, and factory workers.

I acknowledge that not everyone likes unions, but unless you've come up with another way to ensure both labor and capital have equal bargaining power I will stand by my belief that unions are a necessity that overrides any individuals dislike for them.

Estimate insurance cost for Yamaha r6?

A small hint that helps me is keep in mind the elevation change between you and your opponent. If you are at the same elevation as your opponents who is a long way away from you, bullet drop will be more apparent than it would if you were shooting at an opponent that is slightly higher or lower in elevation. My suggestion is to go off the beaten path, find an exact target at range you want to hit (a small window or something) and try your best to predict the drop. If you get it wrong, figure out the range and elevation change and keep that in mind on future targets. Also, use the reticles!!!",1519862637
"Reformed","t5_2riuy","Some of the verses make no mention of intention, but simply state that lying is evil. They cannot be discarded because other verses also talk about intention.

&gt; If you are referring to Romans 3:4a-8, then that is in the context of discussing the righteousness of God, and how the unrighteousness of man reveals the righteousness of God and his justice. We shouldn't have the intent to act unrighteously to glorify God's justice or grace. I don't see how this relates much to this ethical dilemma, since in this dilemma we already have the expressed intent to act righteously.

Is not the abounding of God's glory a righteous intention? Shall we not lie, that God's glory may abound? God forbid.

Is not the saving of a man's life a righteous intention? Shall we not lie, that a man's life might be saved? God forbid.

Lying to save a life is doing evil, that good may come. Romans 3 clearly speaks against it.

&gt; If you are talking about 2 Peter 2:15, then if you recall Balaam from the old testament, he was a selfish swindler essentially. Obviously we are not to follow his example.

Right, so why are you seeking gain through wrongdoing? Saving a life is certainly gain.

&gt; I still don't see how Rahab's lie is disconnected from her actions in hiding the spies. These actions are a part of the same narrative. If she acted unrighteously, I would think the text would explicitly point that out; at least at one point in scripture where she is held up as a righteous example.

Sarah laughed at God and doubted the promise, yet she is commended for her faith. Moses killed an Egyptian, yet refused to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. Hebrews 11 doesn't mention those sins, only their faith followed by action. Rahab had faith followed by action, but the pre-eminent focus of the passage is the faith of those in the hall of faith, which enabled their actions.

&gt; We must seek to tell the truth as much as possible in any situation.

Yes, and it is possible to not lie when the Nazis are at the door.",1519862637

I'm not going to dig too deep into all the ""acting"" Directors who only served for 2-100 days.  From that list there's a grand total of 0 Democrats who have served any meaningful portion of a standard 10 year term.  

And yet people on the far right still bought a media campaign that this one law enforcement agency happens to be the only one against them.  And that the FBI is somehow due for a cleansing.

Which is doubly sad considering these same people probably know nothing about J Edgar Hoover.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Good point, you are right that it ""renders"" everything. Although from that same react page:

&gt;Even though React only updates the changed DOM nodes, re-rendering still takes some time. In many cases it’s not a problem, but if the slowdown is noticeable, you can speed all of this up by overriding the lifecycle function shouldComponentUpdate, which is triggered before the re-rendering process starts. 


and that page also provides instructions for optimization if necessary. I've never had issues with slow rendering but if I ever were to notice any then I could fix it using those instructions.

Good point though, thanks for bringing it up.

an alternative way to deal with this, might be, to have the ReduxX global state component (the main component) to be hosted in a component that doesn't contain all the children, I will test this

You shoupdn't say anything back that could make the situation worse but rather forgive and feel sorry for the person who said it. Why? Because you reap what you sow.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","* **Ogres** are a warrior culture, and many of their stories revolve around great warriors on epic quests. Most often, these stories revolve around a warrior, man or woman (though usually a woman), who faces personal struggles of some sort that hinder their progress in their quest. The tales ultimately culminate in a moral lesson. Such lessons include things about how a warrior's pride should never blind them to what is important, or how one's lust for war and battle can lead them down a destructive path. Tales of glory and heroics are often mixed in with stories of the hells of war. The hero of the story may have a foil that represents their opposite, a focus on the duality of the lesson the story is meant to teach.

* **Naga** are intensely religious, and their stories are heavily centered on their spiritual beliefs. Reincarnation plays a key role, and standing trial before the *Seven Spirit Judges* is a recurring theme. They focus on how their actions effect their spirits in the next life, and what kind of life they will be born into following the Cycle of Reincarnation. Death, the circumstances thereof, and the journey of the soul from the living world to the spirit world, all core parts of Naga storytelling and folklore. The Naga love a good song, and a Priestess will usually put the story into song form for her congregation. Admittedly, Naga songs are more like a lot of hissing and whistling in tune with various string instruments, but the idea is the same.

* **Oxar'bo.** The people of the Ox Zodiac Realm aren't the most creative or attentive sort. Something short and simple, that they don't have to think too hard about and can easily recall in order to tell their children would be the best story to tell them. They don't normally write things down, so that will help them quite a bit. Surprisingly, despite their reputation for being dull witted brutes, they quite enjoy poetry.

- June moved an hour away from Sugar Bear and bought a sweet house that’s not filthy.

- She had gastric sleeve surgery, lost a ton of weight and is now a size 10 (ish)

- Sugar Bear married the obese, verbally abusive, mega whale of bitch he was cheating on June with. This lady is fucking nuts and belongs on TM.

- Sugar Bear has only visited Alana a couple of times since the move. His temper seriously rivals David’s and it was finally caught on film during the season 1 reunion. 

-He upgraded his man cave from the Manper to a shipping container.

- Pumpkin got knocked up by her bf. She is keeping the baby and hopes to finish HS. (She had the baby already IRL actually)

- June is blind in one eye and is currently suffering from a detached retina which she had surgery for in the last episode. 

- She is dating this very odd looking fellow who seems nice enough.

I think that covers it. See if you can find Season 1 somewhere and watch it - definitely worth the effort. ",1519862642

I know that a +Spd IV is better for FSL+, but I don't have a +Spd IV, and I spent a lot of feathers getting this lance so dammit I'm going to use it. However I will probably still play with Brave Lance+/Death Blow, as well. I finally have a spare Palla and Hinoka, so it's time for Hone/Goad inheritance. I just can't decide who to give them to. I *thought* I'd give Hone to Cordy, but someone pointed out that it would be better for her to benefit from Hone than to carry it. So right now I'm thinking Hone to Elincia since she supports Cordy most often, and Goad to Cordy. Then I'll have Ward on Minerva and Fortify on Cherche (idk if those are *ideal* for them but it's what I have to work with). And that's... the extent of the gaming I've done lately.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","So Kronos decided that mortals, who would essentially ignore the monsters (due to the Mist) if the Camp Half Blood wasn’t there to fight them, were more important than the army he would fight? Seems like a bit of a dumb decision, although I’ll admit fictional characters do retarded things all the time.

Either way, they still have an established resistance to magic, strong enough that they flat out ignore spells that have no trouble affecting mortals.

Why make a distinction between HP magic and PJO magic? Does magic resistance not translate at all across other works of fiction? Or does the fact that the Demigods are Greek completely nullify it in other universes. 

I’ll have to disagree with that, in this case, you kind of have to prove PJO magic resistance *can’t* block HP magic. Because otherwise there’s literally no reason to believe it can’t, unless it’s shown that can only block Greek based magic (the opposite of what we see,).

Assuming that there are no heavy hitters (like Percy, Leo) for either side, then yeah, without magic resistance Camp HalfBlood would lose. But, at the very least (assuming magic resistance), they could shrug off a couple spells, and in close quarters I doubt any Wizard would last long against a demigod (although admittedly they’re only mildly superhuman at best, but still better armed and trained for hand to hand combat). 

They also have Apollo archers, who can fire half a dozen arrows at once with enough accuracy to hit small pigeons. Depending on how many there are (I believe there are at most twenty for each cabin) they could potentially wipe out a good portion of hogwarts pretty quickly on their own.",1519862643

The whole fact WWII became a thing even though germany still was in *massive* debt, and the fact that Nazi-germany was able to expand massively, which requires an insane amount of ressources and production is pretty awestrucking if you keep that statement as it is.

Sure, he was an absolute psycho and shouldn't be looked up to, but even though I have a very very left view on politics, I still kinda respect that man for what he did besides doing an unethical, unconstructive and very cruel genocide.

This whole thing kinda goes well into the things you wrote there, although it seems to me that what this man accomplished can't just be attributed to the efficiency of a dictatorship alone, but I'm very open for facts that prove otherwise.",1519862643

Without any alterations it gives an integer value from 0 to 800, and really as long as their is some sort of water, even a little moist, it's in the 700s. I have only seen it at 0 and maybe 100 if it is completely dry.

I've tried some number manipulation with simple math like taking 10 readings over a duration of time (1 second to 10 seconds) and I just can't seem to calibrate it right to where if it's kinda moist, it will give 400 (in the middle) saturated with water, 800 and very little water, 100.

If you have any suggestions, that'd be great. I've done quite a bit of research and nothing has turned up from it.

He really wanted the whole line up in dress uniform so I agreed.  But I was out of the service by now and has reverted pretty far back into “shaggy hippie” status and it was all very last minute getting out there but I thought I could pull it off.  The day of the wedding and we are running errands and he decides to go into the barber shop he had gone to since he was a toddler.  They all knew him by name, asked him about his mother and brothers, wanted to know all about Army life etc.  They were all so excited as he talked about getting married.  And he was just beaming.  I remember being impressed at how his barber could basically sculpt his hair with just the clippers.  It was pretty mesmerizing to watch.  I was loving it.  To a white Montana cowboy it was like being dropped into a alternate universe. I’m just sitting in the empty barber chair next to him and watching them all reliving their childhood memories together.  It was just such a genuine experience.  Then one of the other barbers asks me if I needed a haircut too and I immediately started feeling self conscious and a little guilty that I was going to be “that hairy guy” at his wedding.   But I knew the girl I liked hated my hair short so I had been growing it out. My motivations were suddenly and an impasse and I hesitantly said, sure let’s do it.  He throws the cape on me, fired up his clippers, spins me around to face him and there was just this awkward 3 second pause where we both realized that he had never cut a white persons hair before.  And then just as I was about to say something, he just commits and goes for it.  
 Problem is, I have a pretty prominent widows peak that is long straight hair that by this point lays back over the top of my head.   And he just mowed it straight across in a perfectly straight line.  I remember watching this clump of 10” long hair fall off the front of my forehead and just having  that instant feeling of regret.  By later that night I had this surreal version of 5 o’clock shadow all around my hairline that looks like I took a sharpie and gave my self a pointillist tattoo all around my scalp in all the pictures. But with long hippie hair on the sides and back.  I  was supposed to meet up with the girl I was desperately in like with up in D.C. later that week to tell her how I felt about her.  But I was so self conscious at how awful and awkward my hairline looked that i couldn’t do it.  She moved to Portugal and I came home and wallowed in self pity until I finally chopped the rest off to match.  

I’ve always thought that would make a great scene for a Tyler Perry movie.  But the whole thing made me realize in a very humorous way that everybody’s life experience is so different yet we always try and judge other people’s by our own exclusive perspective. Find the opportunities to explore other people’s culture.  The worst thing that can happen to you is a bad haircut.  ",1519862648

1) Good people don't join gangs. Period. End of story.

2) As a former resident of Winnipeg, this isn't a new trend. Lots of middle eastern and black gang members. Mad Cowz (not a joke) is an exclusive African and Middle Eastern street gang that's been in Winnipeg for over a decade now. Members are usually high school to young twenties in age.

Most relevant info in there. Things started to get better when they started kicking them out of the country. Probably wont happen under Trudeau.

This may be a controversial sentiment, not shared by many here. The Hells Angels are the lesser of two evils. They do not commit petty crime, they do not go around mugging innocent people, they do not go around raping women all the time. They are shady as fuck criminals running a business. Who are at most times, smart enough to not want to get caught, so they keep a low profile. 

From police members I know, they say neighbourhoods where Hells Angels have a club house are usually safer than other comparable neighbourhoods, because they police it in their own way, and don't want to draw unwanted police attention. 

In short, even Canadian criminals are better members of society than foreign criminals or native gangs.  ",1519862650

Also it depends on if he is making at least minimum payments or is paying it all by next billing cycle. If so, there should not be an impact. If minimum or late payments are happening, it is a concern that lowers score. 

2) Yes, it is okay to be upset because he did not ask them made it seem like no big deal. The main concern is charging something on your card without asking first

But I would try to make peace first. Ask his plans to pay it off. Is it on time payments? Is it at least minimal payments? It is a lump sum payment? Is it to you or directly to the card from his account?

You are responsible for the charges unless you file a police report or report fraudulent charges. Let’s try to not go here yet. Try to talk to him and say next time he wants to charge on your card, talk to you first to plan for it. ",1519862650

I've been using Inkscape since 2004.

Some form of socialism will be the main form of the economic system in the future, like it or not.  The question is which form, if we can extend democracy to the workplace, in which ways.  Forget about the soviet authoritarian experience, everybody has. ",1519862651

On top of that, there isn't really a reason why several supply chain platforms cannot coexist in order to serve different industries. 

I don't hold any WTC myself, but as an outsider, this feels similar to the Bitgrail fiasco that Nano underwent not so long ago (which I WAS a part of).

I don't suspect it'll get you banned and it would be absolutely ridiculous if it did.

My wife pointed out that they are separate things and it's best to no mix them.  That seemed like wise advice.
Also, and especially if you do continue to get the discount, take photos of the ticket stub and credit card receipt and save those to a photo folder.  That way if there is ever any question, you have the proof to show them that it was a standard showing with the discount.  In fact I now take photos of all of my stubs, receipts, and even take a screenshot of the agileprepaid transaction.  It's overkill and unnecessary but I guess I sleep better at night knowing I have the documentation if I ever need to challenge.

I think that's largely a result of moving from one language to another without adopting or necessarily even learning how the new one works. I.e. from java to C++. 

They just use the new language the same way they would use the old, and while it can be made to work, it's not necessarily how it should be done.

It took him a few days of burning to destroy the body and the fire was burning from morning until late at night then the next day he topped up the pit with timber and fuel and did it all over again. The cops investigating it did it properly and documented with grids and photos the whole process, they also recovered almost all of the victims teeth even though the guy admitted smashing the bones up including the skull while it was burning.

"vainglorygame","t5_32ob1","In 3v3 his sole purpose was to counter vox, that's why you see him used in worlds 2017. I'd say in 5v5 its worse. Let's go through the points you made

Movement speed - it's even more important in 5v5, especially in mid-life game when side pushing to apply pressure. He has low movement speed, so he is at an disadvantage. So what if there's a river? Movement speed is still important, in fact those with higher speed like gwen will travel even faster

Low damage - this is a very weak point in 5v5. Often times, you'll be faced with small 1v1 skirmishes. Adagio can't really 1v1 any hero except for vox, so that is a HUGE problem. Winning 1v1 is the key to snowballing in early - mid game. You say that low damage does not matter that much with 2 other carries, so you're saying that you're relying on other heroes to do the damage? What can adagio offer then? 

Long range - he has the longest range, but after many heroes got a range buff eg saw, gwen, vox etc, the advantage he has is reduced. The advantage he has over vox (which is the sole reason why people pick him) is reduced.

Sustain - his sustain falls off late game. Heroes like gwen and saw will beat him good in the lane. And recalling is important to buy items, you'll have to do it anyway.

Utility - the damage from his A and B falls off hard late game. And with wp adagio, the point of A and B in late game is just to reset your autos. ",1519862654

All it would do is make existing incels more hostile, as they find or create yet another platform for discussion.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","Why should he be entitled?  Because someone who delayed gratification, and worked smarter than others, built up his wealth and purchased a building.  And THIS is how people have apartments.  Virtually 100% of people living in apartments don't have the capital to buy a home.....Or they would be in one.  You would prefer this guy NOT to build the apartment and let people live on the streets?  

We all have virtually the same education and opportunities in this country.  Classifying these people as ""peasants"" is trying to get an emotional reaction for something, the same way you describe them as ""killing themselves working""  or for the landlord, ""just sitting around collecting rent. These are cheap, emotionally driven comments and not an argument. 

You think this guys grandfstrher was ""high on the hog"" when he delayed purchasing tons of thing to make his life better to save up for the apartment building?  Absolutely not.  But he WAS smarter than the ""peasants"" you refer to in the ability to both delay gratification in the present, and educate himself enough to work SMART.

He DOES create value though.  He gives all those people a place to stay.  You think housing doesn't have value, go sleep on the street for the rest of the winter and see how much value a roof over your head has.  Becsuse he is not PHYSICALLY DIGGING A DITCH has absolutely nothing to do with the value created. 

The people on welfare are leeches.  This guy has all the risk, liability, workload, continual maintenance, upkeep, bookkeeping, repairs, problem tenants, taxes, lawyers, making sure there are enough tenants, advertising, payroll, and the list goes on.  The guy is NOT just sitting back and collecting a check.  That's the welfare recipients you talk about.  They receive a check, on the back of this guy providing lodging, and don't do a single fucking thing in life but leech off society. 

That is completely why capitalist condemn welfare recipients.  Do to logical, rational reasons, and......real life.  

Doesn't matter whether the guy is a trust fund baby or an immigrant who starts a company from nothing.  Both are providing value to many other people in society.  

I'm sure if I used your rational back to you, you wouldn't just do something for me for nothing.  Or agree to give everything you have accumulated in life to whoever I choose.  No, you would be indignant about that.  Becsuse I would be saying you don't have agency or ownership over your own life.  

And it doesn't follow at all that ""you receive $1,000,000 paycheck, have unprotected sex, etc"" that you then are deemed worthy to rule.  With capitalism, if you fuck it all up, you lose it to people who ARE making good decisions.  Better decisions than you.  That's how life works.  The better decisions you make, the more ambitious you are, the better your life will almost undoubtedly be. 

The apartment owner is adding MUCH more value than any of the people renting his apartments out.  Which one of them is providing lodging for 100 people or more every month?  Zero.  

And your ""wife"" example is so far skewed it made me laugh out loud.  You don't buy a slave when you get married, it's simply a contract beteeen two people to live in conjunction with each other. Lol. Where you equate capitalism and marriage is something I've never seen!! Lol. Sorry, but that shits hilarious!

Capitalism is VOLUNTARY exchange man.  Every counter example you have implies thst someone else should be GIVING someone something.  But to do this, something has to be taken by force from someone else first.  Hence violation of human and property rights.  

If you sell your wife and rape her, you are treating her worse than any capitalist would treat anything, becsuse they don't want to destroy anything of value.  So basically you're saying you're going to marry some bitch that doesn't have as much intrinsic value as a damn dog.

Just curious, why do you believe in Fascism over capitalism and socialism?  I've never met anyone who is for fascism that has these views before.

We had a devastated team with injuries and suspensions, no HC -- and now we have a guy that brought MSU to 8 win seasons on average.

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","Late to the party, but I will chime in on one thing I haven't seen much talked about here.

Engineering doesn't really need to be lumped into bins and categories. You can and WILL (should you rise to the challenge) pick specialities.

For example, I'm a biochemical engineer by training, currently working as a process engineer to improve the process of making inorganic gels. I can model and strip down a car engine, while designing a system to isolate proteins, while rewiring a computer or a server to reduce lag time, while diagnosing a bioreactor on a wastewater treatment plant on top of that.

Point is, while it is imperative that you get a very thorough grasp of engineering principles from one of the big four ( mechE civE, elecE, chemE) don't assume that you are trapped there. Getting exposure to what type of engineering problems are out there will help you learn what specialities you want to focus on AFTER  you learn the problem solving behaviors and principles of engineering.",1519862661
"rpg","t5_2qh2s","That's not an accurate assessment of what's going on rhetorically here. I apologize if somehow I have given you an impression that I said these inaccurate things.

Here is what is going on:

You are repeatedly stating D&amp;D is ""not good at"" various things.

You are not stating _for whom_ this is supposed to be true --other than an implied ""for everyone"".

I am saying, if it's the implied ""for everyone"" then this is incorrect as soon as there's one counterexample.

(I have not claimed my understanding is ""the one true way""--only that the existence of even one group (say, mine) is such a counterexample.)

Beyond that, there are dozens of counterexamples on blogs and youtube and all over the web easy to find.

So when you say D&amp;D is bad at these things do you mean:

For your group alone?

For most people?

For most gamers?

For most gamers who play D&amp;D?

And then, once that question is answered: other than your guess that what makes things hard for _your_ group must transfer to the entire sample group, you don't have any evidence afaik.

You are making a totalizing claim ""D&amp;D is bad at x"" 

I am not--I am simply saying that it (like most things in art) is very audience dependent.

ALL groups must find some other game better for all these things if your claim (in its current form) is true.

Only some groups must like D&amp;D for any of these uses if my claim is true--and I can easily prove that.

My claim is provable. Yours isn't--or if it is, I haven't seen the evidence.

As for your question: Yes, of course. Me recommending D&amp;D has literally never not worked out for anyone ever.

So, my question: for what group of people do you claim D&amp;D is ""bad at"" all these things?",1519862661

Don't fret over it, nearly everyone fails really hard in that fight and the blame game can get really disgusting and often is targeted at the wrong people

I say Ramuh is the worst but that's probably because the players queuing for it often just hit level 50 and want to do all the level 50 content. The quality of players here will be really low.

Good King Moggle Mog (extreme) is probably just as bad.

When they get to level 60 they will more often or not have learned that doing the extreme things blind in the DF isn't the way to go. So those duties get queued for far LESS often, and when you do get one of these in the Mentor roulette the quality of players should be significantly higher.

As for the other ""difficult"" encounters from ARR that new players queue for often would be Garuda, Ifrit, Titan, and Shiva.

These duties aren't nearly as bad. I feel like they are much more straight forward and therefore less likely to frustrate people.
The only exception would be lagging players in Titan, but atleast when you see someone get pushed off you KNOW that that player is the one that messed up. 

Anyway, no reason to get riled up over things like this. Do your best. And if you get a duty that you absolutely despise there is no real shame in just leaving it and eating the penalty.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Well heres my reasoning for saying that.
solo tactics 

""At 3rd level, all of the inquisitor’s allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining **whether the inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats.** Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies’ positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive the listed bonus."" Emphasis mine.

The inquisitors benefit is that the descriptor of the text. Lets compare bonded mind and ally shield.

Bonded mind
""As long as you can see each other, you and an ally who also has this feat can trade nonverbal messages. These function as the message spell, except that you don’t need to whisper or point, and you cannot be overheard."" the bonus Bonded mind offers is that we can communicate. it doesnt say that this is something only I can do

Ally shield
""Whenever you are the target of a melee or ranged attack and are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can initiate this feat to skillfully pull the abettor into harm’s way or dodge behind the abettor as an immediate action."" this says that the inquisitor can take the action. it explicitly specifies whether the feat owner or his partner gain the advantage.

It is in this way that one could argue that RAW, certain teamwork feats effect more people than just the inquisitor. This defies the spirit of solo tactics however, which is why I encourage DM discretion.

After we'd split, I slowly realized just how little of her culturally acted Japanese, and how much of her fixation on her Japanese heritage was related to her BPD. I remember how she yelled at me that my backgrounds' absolute value of family was ""archaic"", yelled at me for being too emotionally reserved, yelled at me for being too focused on work, and once insulted my grandmother's tea.

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Gonna take a crack at summarizing to see if someone can correct my understanding:

* Astronomers ~~at the University of Tel Aviv~~ **with Australia's Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization and Signature (EDGES) experiment** were studying the earliest/furthest stars in the universe.

* In studying them, they mapped the early cosmic radiation the stars were bathed in.

* They expected to find a strong absorption line at the 21-cm wavelength, which corresponds to the principal emission spectrum of gaseous hydrogen.

* They instead found *even stronger* absorption than the maximum predicted, suggesting that there is something else besides just the early stars doing the absorbing. 

* The idea is that the extra absorption was the result of ""cooling of the cosmic gas induced by its interaction with dark matter"". The statistical amount by which the absorption exceed the expected maximum is 3.8 sigma.

* The amount of extra induced cooling suggests that dark matter is in the form of a ""highly non-relativistic"" particle. In essence, most of their mass-energy is contained by the particle rest mass. Current estimates put this dark matter candidate at a few multiples of the mass of a proton, much less than many experiments are currently targeting.

Somewhat of a tangent but it always amazes me what we can learn from the ""experiments"" the universe performs for us, as long as we're curious and methodical enough to look.

Edit: changed research team

If you don't give yourself a good fundamental understanding of **How** and **when** to approach, defend, and punish behavior then you will be eating losses more than someone who can do that but sticks to autocombos. 

Admittedly, approach neutral game is something very difficult to explain but essentially always keep moving and put yourself in a position that will be beneficial to you. I know that's vague but specific things can include  ""I can do this super and return to a neutral state of approach or I can carry him into the corner and try for a reset"". Another example being recognizing animations and frames of when things are okay and not okay. Lights are difficult to punish, mediums easier, hards fairly easy unless it pushes you or them back. Specials are usually punishable but some can be plus on block. Supers are all punishable with a jab. Recognizing which moves have openings while you are blocking will give you more opportunities to land hits and execute combos that you've learned. In terms of defending, generally block low. If at any point you see your opponent jump, switch to a high block or do a crouching heavy if you think you will be fast enough to hit it before he hits you. 

Im only an android level player right now but my win percentage is 68%so I can help you out if you send me a match where you lose and one where you win. I can point out what you did right and wrong.

Why not? We know the trophy was a port key enchanted by Barty Crouch Jr. In a testimony to Dumbledore he admitted to working on behalf of Voldemort under the influence of veritaserum.

&gt;The recent death eater activity is due to Sirius Black, who the ministry believes is hiding in between the muggle world and the wizard world. We've sent these out to find him.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you mean dementors and not that the ministry is conspiring with Death Eaters. And even with the Ministry sending out dementors, their attacks don't make much sense. The ministry isn't so incompetent that they would release untamed dementors to attack children. They've been acting out of line.

&gt;The sightings of Voldemort are false. Again, These are simply accusations with no evidence or proof.

Multiple sightings are evidence that something is amok.

&gt;The Death Eaters are a dark wizarding group, with no connection, whatsoever to Voldemort.

The Death Eaters are a group created by Voldemort, they were his servants during the first wizarding war. Claiming they have no connection whatsoever is revisionist history of the highest degree.

A smaller portion who rose anywhere from 2 to 5ish to relieve the other group. About half of all people to be the 9-5ers who perform many of the daytime tasks that keep the tribe/village going. Then the smallest portion are floaters who often sleep shorter periods (but often more frequently) and who wake easily, sleep vigilantly, and can easily adapt their sleep schedules.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Well it all depends on how important or fundamental this sanity system you'll be implementing will be.

Look at Call of Cthulhu, your sanity is based on your ""Power"" stat and that's the main focus of that stat.  Basically every player has equal opportunity to boost that stat as much as they want and are able to without it having any kind of adverse effect on character builds and focuses.  So if you're going to implement a sanity system that plays a key role in your campaign then you will almost definitely need a new separate stat that doesn't detract from the other stats that will be your defining stat for sanity roles.  You could even make it a CoC stat, and saves with it would be done in the same d100 style of CoC.  Determining that stat is the part I don't know, so other then letting everyone just start at something like ~80 I can't really comment on.

If it's not that important or will play a smaller role then you can just leave it as a Wis save.  Your wisdom, which is your willpower in a way, should realistically be what defines your ability to deal with things that would make a person lose their minds.  But again, if it'll be a common and key aspect of the game then by doing this and staying ""realistic"" you will essentially be making non Wis PCs extremely subpar and likely to go unplayed since they'll just go insane.

The middle ground could be to allow your players to choose which of the three mental stats to choose as their ""sanity"" saving throw.  It'll allow for more classes to actually be played, but you will also be putting any non-magical class at risk of being unplayable if again this sanity system is common and key.  Maybe let Con saves also be an option, it's not a mental stat but you could say someone of enough constitution can force themselves to withstand such effects, or some bullshit like that lol

So yeah, all in all if it's not a common or key part of your system then leave it as wisdom saves cause it makes the most sense.  If it is common and key then either make a new stat for the players to all get a chance to get or allow them to choose what stat to use as their ""sanity stat.""  If you don't do something like that only classes with proficiency in wisdom saves will make it very far, everyone else will feel cheated.",1519862668

In my case, because I spent a rather long time studying for the MCAT (a 7 hour long intense exam, mind you), taking a 5-hour GRE test was cakewalk (in terms of staying motivated and diligent for the entire exam). I am a math major, so if I didn't score well on the GRE Quant section, I would have incurred the wrath of my school's entire math department. The only portion lacking was my GRE verbal, specifically the vocabulary portions. I spent roughly an hour a day to review vocabulary and memorize 20 new words. I took Sundays off. After roughly 1,300 vocab words I took it. My comment history should go into more detail about my schedule/how much I studied.

Score is 167Q/163V/6.0AWA

/r/GRE is a good subreddit.

The test was not hard for me and it was cheap too. Everything is easy and cheap after the MCATs, ahaha... One of my strongest advice to new students sitting the GRE exam is to spend at least 5 weeks taking 10 or more practice exams under properly timed conditions. If 10 is not possible, get your hands on as many full-length practice exams as possible (I did 6). The more practice exams you take, the better grasp you have of GRE's questions and its tricks. There are only certain number of ways the questions can trick you. Plus, you build up the endurance to sit for 5 hours. Though, the key to improving from practice exams is to thoroughly review them (I took the exam one day, reviewed half the next day and the latter half the following day).",1519862669

&gt;However, there were players getting higher than that value, and many players getting much lower than that value. Due to the huge number of players killing Revenants, more than we'd ever anticipated (over twice the amount of players killing them than on their initial release), there are typically anywhere between 2-5 players attacking the same one. This is making the kills extremely fast. Whilst this does mean only one of the players is getting the loot, they're consistently getting more gold per hour than others. **In addition to this, because of the inflated number of kills per hour, there are more resources being introduced to the game than we ideally would like.** 

I bolded the important part. *That* is why revs were nerfed, because their numbers were showing more resources were coming in than they wanted to.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Why do you trust an institution that ruled slavery legal, the fugitive slave law constitutional, and once said no one of African descent could ever have any rights in this country over some random guy on the internet? Why would you even need to trust a random guy on the internet when you can look up the many, many times the Supreme Court has ruled incorrectly? Why can't you just trust your own reading comprehension of the plain language of the Constitution itself in the first place. Talk about your classic case of learned helplessness...

Defense against tyranny is not the most illogical defense of the second amendment. It's not even really just a defense of the second amendment. It's the historical fucking reason it was even put into the Constitution. Yeah, believe it or not, it's not debatable why the same guys that were just able to throw the chains of what they viewed as tyranny off because they owned guns decided to explicitly say their new government couldn't infringe on the right to keep and bear arms. It must be uncomfortable hearing this fact, what with the cognitive dissonance that follows.

The Japanese could have and probably should have defended themselves from government tyranny. And for that matter, I wish that Americans not of Japanese descent would have done the same. The second amendment doesn't guarantee there won't be no tyranny; it is to allow the people to fight back against tyranny if they so choose. Unfortunately, Americans of that era neglected what the founders of the country probably thought was their duty to do so. Just because someone doesn't use their freedom of speech to speak against government tyranny doesn't mean the right isn't a right anymore. But then again, you didn't know non-sequiturs were logical fallacies.

 You were right about one thing, though (you're probably just as shocked as I am). If you're subject to tyranny and are ready to fight back against it, you don't care whether you weapons are legal or not. The forest you missed for the trees, however, is that if you don't have any weapons because they were confiscated because some random guy on the internet thought the second amendment didn't do shit so the future tyrant took them, then if won't make a damn difference, will it?

So proud of the superiority of military might, eh? Think the biggest guns win, right? I bet they could use a mind like yours in the Academy, son. By the way, care to explain Vietnam, or the many campaigns we've had in the Middle East?

Unless you propose that a tyrant will just bomb into complete obliteration every square inch of its citizens until there's nothing but dust left. And if you think that's the case, you'll **never** convince pro-gun Americans to give up their guns; they'd have nothing to lose when their government cares so little for them to treat them with such disregard.

P.S. - Be sure to look up false equivalence *before* you wrongly accuse someone of it only to be guilty of said fallacy in your lackluster attempt at a rebuttal. Doing this allows you look only like an idiot, instead of a troll. If you are, however, a troll, carry on.",1519862671

His mother has basiclaly been his coach, trainer, advisor, and every other important figure that athletes have in their lives throughout his. She isn’t the type of mom Eli Apple had who buttered him up. She’s a quiet and reserved woman who’s pushed Lamar to where he is today.

I get people arguments for an agent. They prepare you for meetings. They give you good press. I get it. But for as much press as this is getting, it kinda accomplished giving him press himself, without needing to pay off Kiper to throw you up a board like some agents do. I just don’t understand how she isn’t qualified to make phone calls and set up things with these teams. If they’re interested, they’re doing most of the work anyways.

Lamar’s worked for everything in his life and his mother has been the leading driving force behind his success. It makes way more sense when people realize that that she would act as his agent. She isn’t going to butter him up in meetings, because she won’t even do it in their daily lives.

I see a bunch of people hating on him for it, but she got him to this point, so why would they do things differently now? And as people just commenting on the internet, who are we to judge whether she will do a good job or not. We don’t talk about agents in any other instance for athletes basically, and many screw over the players they represent. In fact, the ease it is to become an agent for an NFL prospect or player is ridiculous, it’s basically a joke of a title that anyone can become cerfitifed with. So I really don’t understand why the hate from people about this move, considering tons of athletes will get their best friend or a 3rd bit agent anyways.

• Presses pencil hard as fuckin can be when first sketching

• When they press down hard, they sketch by going back and forth when making the lines. This drives me insane. 

• Colors in different directions. Like on a cat colors the ears diagonally, then right half of face up and down and left half by horizontal. 

• Usually draws mediocre anime characters. I’m not fucking kidding when I say this. I’ll link in an example.

"SymmetraMains","t5_3el72","Thank you for the clarification, I understand what you are saying now.

I find playing Symmetra really fun. She isn't my most played character since I do not feel confident enough to play her in all situations like other Symmetra Mains, but I consider myself a Symmetra Main simply because she is my favorite. Her kit is very unique. It has some Tower Defense/RTS elements to it that I really enjoy. No other hero has that. I do not play her for her primary fire, I play her for these strategy elements, and I think this should be taken into consideration too. I'm sure a lot of people like her for these elements too, it doesn't comes down to being too lazy to learn to aim with other characters (For example, I have only one hour less on Zenyatta than I have on Symmetra).

I don't think it is fair to blame high ranked Symmetra Mains for toxic, angry teams. People shouldn't be scared of playing their favorite character because they might be bullied. She is soon getting a rework to become more viable, though, so maybe then people will accept her existence a little more. I hope she continues accessible to you guys though. I hope you enjoy the new hero too, by the way, since she is a support (support/tank hybrid, to be fair) and she is not too mechanically demanding either.

I do not think she is for lower ranks only. I think she deserves whatever rank she can get to, exactly because it is so hard to play her against high ranked people. Someone that gets there with Symmetra is pretty good at dodging enemy fire and placing their constructs strategically, and if they enjoy playing here more than, say, McCree, they should be able to without being bullied.

I am fully convinced it is IH, but of course I am clinging onto the hope that it isn't, and the bloodwork on Monday will find something else.

Exactly, I really do not think it is anything else on top of it. They already did bloodwork at the sleep guy, and even if they didn't strictly test for anything but a thyroid imbalance, my belief is, if they found ANYTHING out of that, they would have said something.

Africans have much more muscle mass, mainly type 2(fast-twitch), compared to Europeans due to the fact biodiversity/sheer amount of calories was much higher than that of Europe. This explains the vast amount of physical differences that can be found between Africans and Europeans. Also when I say modern technology I am perhaps being too broad because I also include monoculture with that aswell, which enabled higher populations of people to live in more places than they could before. ""Modern"" in my mind includes the past few hundred of years which I admit is a bit misleading.",1519862676

Starting from point 5.  I'll just say I disagree that all games are button mashing.  I'm a semi ""top tier"" player in the Dark Souls Franchise, Starcraft franchise, and Super Smash brothers (N64 vers. only).  And well-designed games are made so that there is depth to the combat.  Button mashing isn't involved when each action you take is calculated to a certain end, and there are a variety of actions you can take.

&amp;nbsp;

regarding your advice on 3,  Maybe I need to try a different type of dodging because I can't get it to work, and that's really the root of my lack of enthusiasm.  It's less frustrating as it is just a turn-off.  I don't get upset over this game or anything haha.

&amp;nbsp;

Regarding point 1, the long battles. To me it comes down to engagement.  How engaged am I in this 40+ second long battle?  If I'm constantly on my toes or thinking then that's great.  But as the system stands it's just tap tap tap tap tap tap try to dodge, fail much of the time, tap tap tap tap tap tap.  The most straightforward comparison is pokemon go.  In Pokemon Go I had about 6 Thousand prestige matches on my account.  This is with no bubble strat (which is an exploit that was heavily used and would heavily inflate your prestige count if you used it).  I actually really enjoyed battling, especially prestiging because I could use skill to change the outcome.  My single CP1500-1800 Jolteon could kill TWO CP3000 gyarados if I dodged perfectly and timed my specials right.  I found the prestiging system to be the most engaging and fun part of pogo (which is why i think taking it away was the worst decision PoGo ever made).  Not to mention, even as an underpowered half CP prestiger my battles per monster would still be in the 30 second range.  In short, 40+ seconds would be fine if I felt the activity was fun and engaging.  The system currently feels clunky and simple, which makes it difficult to be fun or engaging.

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT:  Oh, and yeah of course the enemy would do twice as much damage as well.  My purpose is speeding the matches along.",1519862677

I still feel that the lead singer sounds de-masculinized, but there are actually extended periods where he is not singing, which makes it more enjoyable. I'm now skipping to In the Hall of the Mountain King on the second album. As I expected, this an adaptation of the piece by Grieg.

"GoldandBlack","t5_3ffci","Okay, I’ve got to correct you on something... you keep throwing around that 30,000 number, but let me remind you that about 20,000 of those, so 2/3, are suicides.  So we can throw those out because that’s not a violent crime against another.  Then of the remaining 10,000 about 7,000 of those are with handguns.  The remaining are with other types of guns, which is where you’re so called “assault rifles” would fall.  Are you sure you want to ban semi auto rifles?  Statistically that wouldn’t help the problem.  

Also did you know that annually about the same number of people in the US are killed with knives as they are with all guns other than handguns?  It’s true.  Guess you better ban those too.

Also, did you know that 1.3% of yearly deaths in this country are due to firearms?  And I believe that’s including the firearm suicides...

Oh and lastly, while “gun violence” may be higher in the US per capita than other large nations, when you look at the amount of overall violent crime per capita, the US does not even rank in the top 10.  Did you know that?

So what you’re saying is you really just don’t like guns and despite no facts showing they themselves are the problem, you want to place restrictions on them?  Oh also despite the fact that they are a constitutional right in this country... ",1519862679

2. Surprisingly, I didn't hear of any injuries. I think most people who compete have already completed an Ironman so they know what it takes to prepare and prevent injuries. If anything, I'm sure shin splints and knee pain was common from the run up the last mountain. A biker (not involved in the race) was fatally struck by a car on the course that day which shook up a few athletes. At one point I was going downhill at 65mph, so I can see how something like that would happen in the fog along the mountain tops. 
We were required to have our phones on us at all times, so in case we felt that we couldn't finish, we could call our support crew who would come and pick us up. A few people missed a turn, went way off course and were forced to discontinue because of the cutoff points. 
3. I ran Track and XC in Highschool and College. Was a couch potato for a few months after I graduated so I felt the only way to keep myself motivated to work out after  graduation was to sign up for marathons or the Ironman.

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

Conversely, highly competent individuals may erroneously assume that tasks easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are well-versed in.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","4 is min, 6 is preferred. I ran a group of 10 - 12 for months just fine, but that was before cell phones and laptops. Large groups are fun, because when all the necessary roles are double covered, a few players can experiment with their characters. And you can still play when 2 or 3 don't make it.

The key to running large groups is making everyone understand the time crunch. We going to play for 4 hours, I'm going to talk for at least half of that. That means in a party of ten each player gets 12 minutes. That means if you take 2 minutes to decide what you're going to do and roll your dice, you only get 6 turns. Everyone needs to pay full attention even when it is not your turn, so when it comes to you - you know exactly what you are going to do. People who only pay attention during their turn are the death of me.

Secondly; everyone needs to learn how to optimize their rolling. e.g In D&amp;D roll to hit with advantage/disadvantage, damage, and crit all at once. Then ignore anything that doesn't apply. Group your dice by color, and be consistent. Don't cheat.

Next step is to have players operate in pairs. They plan together between turns, so when they are up they can basically describe and roll at the same time.

Before I ran my own large game I attended one where the DM used an assistant. The first session went great, because we operated in pairs by happy accident. The experienced players threaded themselves with the newcomers. The second session fell apart, because everyone started acting on their own, and the assistant got bored. He became a huge distraction.

And finally, be aware of your technology usage. They can do a lot of cool things, but we tend to not notice how much time it takes to use them. And that's when they aren't being a distraction. I'm not saying don't ever use tech. I'm just saying be aware of how much time it is consuming, and evaluate when it helps or hinders.",1519862683

Having a compression area is fine, with a ""wrong way"" slash, where you make sure all your belts are fully compressed to the prioritized side. In fact I highly recommend you make sure your belts are compressed as you'll get better performance from a compressed belt. 

Resupplying towards the priority side *must* be done with the right way slash or the majority of the splitters do nothing except recompress an already compressed belt. 2 belts in is 2 belts out, and you haven't shifted a belt anywhere.

The goal was to have a priority side of the bus. Belt shifting towards the priority side is what the right way does, in the simplest fashion, literally because you can't do it in fewer splitters. The ""right way"" will recompress using any of the remainder if it prioritizes the full inputs as well as outputs. 

Alternatively you can terminate the belt (which is what /u/Interdeparmentmail should probably just do for a lot of them) but then you're barely able to call it a bus. The belts don't have to be shared if you know you're going to use up an entire belt at a time, but, if you're only using 7/8ths of 7 belts, you can have 8 exits with belt shuffling.

1. Put small/medium pan on stove and turn heat to medium. 
2. Crack X number of eggs into a bowl or cup. (I find a cup easier if 3 or less eggs)
3. Season your eggs with what your preferences are. I like to use pepper and cayenne pepper. DO NOT add salt yet. 
3. Add roughly quarter cup of milk per milk per 2 eggs, but I usually eyeball it. You can add more milk for creamier eggs. Mix all ingredients together. 
4. Add some oil (flavored olive oil is great) or butter to the pan. Dump egg mixture into pan once it is heated up.
5. Turn the heat up a little bit more and using a rubber spatula, **continually** scrape the pan while the eggs are cooking, you should start to see the eggs forming into nuggets-type shapes. 
6. Just keep turning/scraping the eggs until they are done and enjoy. 

*its important to make sure not to over cook the eggs, if you do they will be dried out, not light/fluffy/creamy.

The more you explain, the more stone-faced they get. Then you realize there’s a third person in the room for a reason and that the decision has already been made. They’re just using whatever you say to better document the separation notice, not to see whether your job can be saved. 

When the meeting ends, The Lonely Man song softly plays as you walk out to the parking deck with your cardboard box. You try to hold back the tears and not punch the dashboard until you get a few blocks away. 

Later that night, one of the cool girls from work will call you. It’ll make you feel better as you rant and rave to her. But you’ll realize a few days later that she doesn’t give a shit either.

It would be easier to try and find signs of mental illness from the the Hadith. No person with mental illness does the things the prophet used to do. This is infact something the Prophet Muhammad responded to.

I would assume anyone that says that he was a mad man isn't a Muslim. That brings me to this question. 

If Islam is false and not from God, that means he probably had to have wrote it. How can a crazy person write such a book? *He was also illiterate too so that proves that argument wrong.

The only option after that is to say that he was either lying in which he had no reason to lie or to say someone wrote it for him and he was still crazy.

Yes. That would be one major concern but luckily, the Hadith is compiled with many different narrators who say the same things. While some Hadith's do say slightly different things with wording or slight details due to human memory, the Hadith is reliable from narrator to narrator. And ""history is written by the victors"" usually means the winners tell their side of the story and theirs gets taken. Most of the Hadith's aren't even about the battles. It's about his day to day living. What he said and what he did. 

At the end of the day it comes down to this.

1st, the companions have no reason to lie or water down as it's a sin to lie about the religion.

2nd, if somehow lies crept in, it would be much different depending on the narrator.

BLOOD! SACRIFICE! STRATEGY! TACTICS! VIOLENCE! EXPLOSIONS!

[WAR!](#naziloli)

But instead we get a cheesy, if brisk overview of Violet's backstory. I could rag on how it doesn't go along as how it is in the novel ch.6, but I understand they're trying to sell Violet's growing character from what is essentially a *very trigger-happy* infant into an actual person with values, without the ramifications and trauma that could affect an adolescent mind. It'd open up a real good arc of her maturing incredibly quickly, but also seem just as much out of place.

But at this point I've come to peace with this corny show. It wants to be emotional for all its moments. The comedic timing of small Violet is on point like always, yet devalue Gilbert's struggles to educate her. I wish they showed a more [Gunslinger Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8G4a_yCJt4) type of relationship between Gilbert and Violet, because that's what it essentially is. Another aspect is the comically evil superiors. And just how the war is a whole lot of  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ when it's just framed out of context. 

So yeah. I'm not happy with the supposed edgy highlight of the show for me. But I've some to terms about it being a momentary emotional spectacle that has nothing to say overall. And that's completely fine to enjoy on a moment to moment basis, just don't expect to remember anything after you're done.",1519862687

3. Make sure you can ski your gear. Go to the resort and crash. Sort that all out. While you're at it ""hit on people"". If you see someone in the lift line with AT gear; ask why they aren't touring today. Answer might be ""didn't have a partner"". You can also go do a practice tour at local cross-country ski spots.
4. Suck it up buttercup and do facebook.
5. Meetup.com sometimes the ski groups are seasonal or you could start one which costs money. I've considered hosting something at my house using Nextdoor.com just for my neighborhood in hopes of meeting more of my ski touring neighbors. 
6. Go old school and post at climbing gym or local shop if they have a bulletin board.
7. This should be last. Figure out what the most popular tour is and go there and ask people if you can join them. I recommend having awesome food and post beers tour beers in the car if you do this.
8. Ask around there might be a tour everyone considers super safe and so popular if it is a green day you can tour alone. People do it in the Wastchangles on Saturdays all the time. Just be mindful be sure you'd be comfortable skiing the skinner as you go up.
9. Remember many backcountry skiers are dirtbags so a little $$ can go a long ways. Having a rock solid ski rig with AWD/4x4 with snow tires and not caring about gas can go a long ways.

I'm not a knife collector, but I really enjoyed this gift because it combined rustic material, an expert hand and ended in an elegant showpiece that has functionality disguised behind a beautiful presentation. This whiskey seemed the perfect parallel for the knife: a traditional brand with blue collar roots, masterful execution, and a balance of elegance and rustic charm that combines to showcase something truly special.

**Palate:** Sweet and silky up front, tapioca and smooth vanilla, smooth transition to spiced honey, wood spice, and a burst of sweet cinnamon heat, and black pepper. 

**Finish:** Fiery cinnamon and wood spice, sticky lingering honey, dried cherry, light oak, orange peel pithiness, and sweet tobacco. 

**Overall:** This barrel is the truth. I'm a Wild Turkey 101 house brand guy, so I come at this with some bias, but this is one of the best single barrel expressions of a shelf brand I've had in a long time. From the moment I nosed this I knew I was in for it, that cherry/vanilla/leather trio just barrels up and grabs you by the collar. Past that it starts just absolutely layering it on. When a whiskey comes in waves where you feel like you have to come up for air to not miss something, it's a keeper.

By showing that human flourishing is not identical to the quality of being morally good in all possible worlds, he showed that it is not in FACT identical (as identity is a necessary relation).  And this was simply following Harris' own admission that such an argument would indeed refute the moral landscape theory.  This is probably why Harris neglected to even acknowledge the refutation, because he knew it was successful but still wanted to save face.  That, or he had already prepared his litany of red herrings and was still on the whole ""I'm not going to play Craig's game"" kick, lol; either way, his theory was obliterated.

""I'm sorry, but the idea that morality should be reducible to the well-being of conscious creatures is infinitely more reasonable-""

It's not AT ALL reasonable, and Craig pointed out precisely why.

""than the idea that morality is prescribed to us by the Christian God.""

If there existed an all-knowing, all-good being, then yes that would be a far more reasonable source for INFORMATION on morality than an arbitrary suggestion that we ought to flourish because we want to.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","When a game has great action mechanics, but it wants to be a movie at the same time. What I mean is, I'm kind of old school or something like that.

I don't want to boot up a game, watch ten minutes of people talking and cutscenes happening before I get to the thing what made me boot up the game in the first place. 

Examples of games that do this well: Souls games, Bioshock/System Shock, FEAR, Max Payne 1 and 2, DOOM 2016, pretty much anything by Platinum Games. All of those, except DOOM, have a lot of story, but it's told either in unique non-intrusive way, or in short amusing bursts.That's how video game stories should be told. In short comedic cutscenes that transition to gameplay, monologue during gameplay, comic strips, audiologs that you can listen to while killing bad guys etc.",1519862695

My dad violated a stay away order from the court so my mom reported him.  This resulted in him getting a trespassing charge, which he failed to appear in court for.  Then weeks later he asks if Mom told me she tried to have him arrested.  

Sounds like an innocent enough question.  But I know how this man's mind works, it was not innocent at all.  at the beginning of their divorce I set boundaries with them both that I would not report on one to the other etc.  I can't remember how many times he has violated that boundary, but when I called him on it he cursed me out, blocked me on FB, ETC.  

A week goes by and he has the nerve to call me from an unfamiliar number to tell me about a sick relative (that I already knew about).   I told him off (feel great) and he starts gaslighting and justifying why he had that reaction.

Not only does he fly around in a space station that's the head of the Statue of Liberty wearing a ball gag (https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c5/e4/e3/c5e4e37b5006cc0aef1f8e16954cdbd6--space-dandy-statue-of-liberty.jpg) --the character is a giant intelligent Ape, dressed in a Confederate uniform, wearing a George Washington wig, a Lincoln beard, an Uncle Sam top-hat, and with an armored shoulder pad that's made from **Captain America's Shield.**  (That's how iconic a symbol it is.)

To me, there is a logical connection, if a very loose one. Actually, I would apply the same way of thinking I used in my post to your example. When you keep up the word Christian, you help spread the concept of Christianity because people who do not know what Christianity is, are more likely to ask for or gather information on it. Therefore, you automatically grant some degree of importance to this concept, (very slightly) more than it would normally receive.
It is a bit differenf for my argumentation concerning racism because I did not express any opinion towards Christianity here, but towards racism as a bad concept (if legitimately or not does not really matter).

I guess my view is that we should outlaw race and racism in a ""don't feed the troll"" fashion. It sounds odd, but I have no better way to describe it right now.

"factorio","t5_2wabp","A blueprint for 1 km long isn't really undoable. It is really straightforward enough.

For loading and unloading the thing, what you would ideally want is to have smaller trains go to the actual mines, having the trains go to a marshalling yard, form into the long trains, make the journey, and then break into smaller trains on the other side.

Sadly, those don't actually exist in the game. Let's do talk about how you would load the things - you would load straight from belts into the cars with no buffer based on a looping design. You won't get 12 inserters per car, but you don't need to. A 100 car train is just going to overwhelm any and all mines. Details like the train won't be there all the time will just be a rounding error because the train will be there for a long time, slowly filling out.

&gt;taking full advantage of long trains and long tracks, to me, means you stop as little as possible.

This is factorio. There is (almost) never a reason to actually run long tracks. If you have an iron, copper, coal, and water in an area, you can just consume the resources onsite. On pretty much any mapgen setting, you will never have to go that far to find all of the above. Even if you decided to run with water in starting area only, you can just ship the water and save the effort. Even if only one train moves at a time, shipping enough water out doesn't require very much rail capacity.

&gt;Now you've also got 3 trains headed back in the same direction, completely blocking. Unless you only put regular signals on the passing lanes and not on the ""main track"" in which case, trains will never enter the passing lanes to begin with, they'll simply wait in their stations for the chain to open up.

A passing loop is simply a sufficiently long two track section. You regular signal as you enter the two track section, (optional) chain signal as you exit. You can't deadlock in the single track - trains will only move if there is an open place in a passing loop waiting for it. There are simply no signals on a purely single track potion.

&gt;But bidirectional, with that many trains, over that length? It just won't work.

It won't work because factorio mapgen simply isn't sparse enough. If mining patches are tens of kilometers in size (like real mines) separated by hundreds of kilometers (like in the real world), single tracking would be the only option unless if you really want to devote a lot more time to placing things.",1519862703

&gt; ## El periodista abrió el local en Ingeniero Maschwitz e hizo declaraciones sobre lo que pretende con la cervecería.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Diego Brancatelli se sumó al negocio de las cervecerías y abrió la suya propia en Ingeniero Maschwitz. El periodista y militante kirchnerista comenzó con varios proyectos y también apostó a la gastronomía para, según él, ayudar a la economía de Mauricio Macri: _**“En esta grieta, necesito que el comercio se reactive y que a la economía de Macri le vaya bien”**_
&gt; 
&gt; _“**Algunos dicen que yo quiero que el país estalle por los aires.** Se equivocan, porque estaría perdiendo todos mis ahorros en este comercio. **Apuesto a la economía y a que nos va a ir bien, porque, además, es muy rico lo que vamos a hacer**, a muy buen precio y en un lugar hermoso como es el Paseo Mendoza de Maschwitz”_, manifestó el periodista en diálogo con Clarín.
&gt; 
&gt; El local se llama “Merci” (“_Gracias_” en francés, porque está ambientado en ese estilo), y se inauguró el domingo pasado: _“Tengo una buena carta de vinos, que por suerte en los viajes que hice con el fútbol, tengo amigos que tienen bodegas. Ellos me contactaron con unos enólogos muy importantes y me mandaron a Buenos Aires varios de ellos para degustar los vinos. Tengo todos boutique de baja tirada anual pero exquisitos y a muy buen precio”._

No, you are talking about [Third-Way centrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way), which, if you ask me, is more about expedience though compromises with right-wing fanatics than actually having any sort of political principles.

&gt; The free market absolutism was mixed with Christian fundamentalism to become the neoconservative movement demonstrated now by politicians like Ted Cruz.

Again, like the dummies in /r\/neoliberal, you are just confusing neoliberalism and neoconservatism with Third-Way compromises. The drive (back) towards free market policies is *by its own* neoliberal, whereas what the Clinton and Obama administrations did on the whole was Third-Way. ",1519862705

Field hockey players would only be employees if their sport had revenue. If nobody goes to their games and there are no TV deals, then they’re just amateur athletes who nobody is making money off of. If those sports have to go away because they’re not subsidized by revenue sports like basketball and football, then so be it.

Even if you can throw an extra $20 at your smaller debts, you will start to see your budget grow. Even small monthly payments add up to a lot. Don't feel down and out either.

"KingdomHearts","t5_2s3jo","1.) After Xehanort extracted the darkness half of Ventus' heart to create Vanitas, Ventus' heart was fractured, so Xehanort left Ventus on Xehanort's boyhood home, Destiny Islands, to spend his last moments. But, Sora, a newborn baby at this point, unknowingly connected hearts with Ventus and helped mend Ventus' fractured heart. This connection caused Vanitas to take on the appearance of Sora. Since Vanitas is a part of Ventus and Ventus made that connection with Sora, Vanitas took on the appearance of Sora. When Vanitas was created, he was a faceless being. He grew a face due to the connection with Sora.

And later, after the reforged χ-blade shattered, Ventus' heart was fractured once again since the χ-blade was made using Ventus' and Vanitas' hearts. Ventus' heart was able to go out and find Sora's heart once again to take refuge in and heal because of the special connection they now share from the first time they connected on Destiny Islands. And Ventus' body lays comatose in Castle Oblivion. Aqua put him there to keep him safe.

Way later when Sora stabbed himself with the Keyblade of Heart, Sora's heart and Kairi's heart were released from Sora's body. Kairi's heart returned to her comatose body and Sora's heart became a Shadow Heartless. Ventus' heart was still within Sora's body at this point, but instead of getting released like the other hearts, it stayed behind within Sora's body, therefore staying within Sora's Nobody, Roxas. Ventus' heart within Roxas is what causes Roxas to take on the appearance of Ventus. If Ventus' heart wasn't within Roxas, then Roxas would look like Sora. And now that Roxas is within Sora currently, Ventus' heart is back within Sora as well.

2.) No, because Ventus' heart stayed behind within Sora's body/Nobody, Roxas, instead of getting released like the other hearts.

3.) Kairi is a Princess of Heart, so she has no darkness in her heart, so she can't form a Heartless. If her heart is lost, it doesn't become a Heartless. And therefore, she doesn't form a Nobody. In order for a Nobody to be created, a Heartless needs to be created. Instead, her body just lays comatose with no heart.

Kairi's heart was within Sora. When Sora stabbed himself with the Keyblade of Heart, his heart and Kairi's hearts were released. In order for a Nobody to be created, a heart needs to be released from a body and a Heartless needs to form. Sora's heart was released from his body, which turned into a Shadow Heartless. Which also created Sora's Nobody, Roxas. Kairi's heart was released from a body, Sora's body, so a Nobody was created, which is Namine. Since it was Kairi's heart that was released from a body, then it's Kairi's Nobody. Sora's Heartless acted as the Heartless needed to form a Nobody for both Sora's Nobody, Roxas, and Kairi's Nobody, Namine. Roxas is made out of Sora's body and soul, and Namine is made out of Sora's body and soul, even though she's Kairi's Nobody.

And Namine has different hair color and a different hairstyle to Kairi, simply because that's something that can happen with Nobodies. Nobodies can have slight differences from their original selves. Nobodies not looking exactly like their original selves is not something unique to Namine. Xigbar has longer hair than Braig, Dilan has neater hair than Xaldin, Lea doesn't have markings under his eyes like Axel, etc.

Excerpt from the Secret Ansem's Report:
&gt; Yet the Nobody born of someone with a strong heart retains its shape, with but the faintest visible changes.

As you can see, it is completely normal for Nobodies to not look exactly like their original selves. There is no specific reason for Namine having different hair color than Kairi other than ""because that's how Nobodies work"" or ""that's how the laws of nature work in the KH universe"".

Nobodies don't typically look like their human counterparts. Dusks, Assassins, Samurais, etc. look nothing like humans. The stronger your heart is, the more like you your Nobody will look.

As for Namine having a different personality to Kairi, that can be attributed to her growing her own heart. Nobodies can grow hearts of their own. Roxas, Axel, and Namine all grew hearts of their own. Anything can grow a heart. Xion did as well.

4.) Lingering Will is Terra's soul/mind within his Keyblade Armor. There are three components of a being: a body, a heart, and a soul. When you succumb to the darkness/your heart leaves your body, then your heart will turn into a Heartless. Your body and soul will then fade away and wait in a sort of limbo state for your Heartless to be destroyed, and then both halves will return to the whole, and you will be recompleted as your original self again. If you have a strong heart and become a Heartless, then your body and soul will continue living on as a Nobody. If both your Nobody and Heartless are destroyed, then both halves will return to the whole, and you will be recompleted as your original self again. If your soul leaves your body, then you will die. A heart is what holds your memories and emotions. A soul is your life force. It's what drives you to continue living. A body is just a vessel for a heart or a soul.

Lingering Will is similar to a Nobody. A Nobody is someone's soul inside their body, driving the body to continue on living. Lingering Will is Terra's soul inside his Keyblade Armor, driving his Keyblade Armor to live.

5.) Riku was just being self-hating. He used to hate himself, and he used to be jealous of Sora. Riku now being Sora-esque shows that he has grown a lot and now just follows his heart, like Sora does, rather than thinking too much about things.

6.) Riku's heart got sort of kicked out of his body and sent to the Realm of Darkness when Ansem, Seeker of Darkness possessed him. His heart took on the appearance of his body. After Ansem, Seeker of Darkness was destroyed, Riku's body returned to him and he was completed.

7.) Xion isn't supposed to look exactly like Kairi. She's an imperfect Replica first of all, and she also sort of formed an identity of her own. It makes sense for her to have a slight difference like black hair instead of red hair.

Xion is an imperfect Replica of Roxas who's identity was formed out of Sora's leaked memories of Kairi. Her face was blank at first, but she gained an appearance and an identity from Sora's memories of Kairi that leaked out of Roxas into her. So, since her identity is literally created from memories, people see her differently based on their memories and connection to her or their connection to Sora. Most people just see her as a faceless puppet with her hood up, which is how she originally looked before she formed an identity. That's how Saix sees her, and that's how Roxas, Axel, Riku, and Namine saw her at first. Roxas quickly began to see her as herself though: A Kairi with black hair, and Axel, Riku, and Namine later began to see her as herself as well. Xigbar sees her as Ventus, and Xemnas sees her as Sora.",1519862710

"newyorkcity","t5_2qs1t","What'd I'd love to know as a New Yorker of two years who's seen firsthand how atrocious the subway has become in a mere twenty-four months (I can't imagine what it's looked like for someone here for a decade or more), is why in *the holy hell* this past week the MTA had 15+ (maybe even two dozen) employees ""refurbishing"" the floors, walls, and stairs of lower Grand Central.

It's absolutely baffling to me. The NYT ran a piece on the record-shattering costs of the recent 2nd Avenue development, and the primary difference between a city like New York and Paris isn't the city's age or infrastructural complexity, it's the number of employees working on a project at a given time. Multiply those daily labor surpluses and you have the reason why a project that should have been finished nearly eight years ago is now due to be finished in 2021 at hundreds and hundreds percent of the original estimate. 

Twenty MTA employees, four or five actually working and fifteen or so standing around watching, ""upgrading"" the tiling on the floors, the staircases, and the damn walls. 

The MTA is a desperately inept, entangled bureaucracy. Add in a thick layer of political malfeasance spanning multiple administrations and multiple decades, and you have easily the worst transportation crisis in the developed world. 

It really is laughable. I'm stoked that the floors and walls of lower Grand Central, and the USB ports at a handful of stations across the wealthy suburbs of Queens, are being prioritized over basic upgrades of the city's signal system that would positively affect every commuter in the entire metropolitan area.

If you want to go a bit more fancy, I'd suggest [xdress](https://xdress.com/) as they have some stuff that is quite nice and not overly expensive.  They are also cut for the male body so easy to wear as well.

"NorthKoreaNews","t5_2wlaq","You are regurgitating what the ""official"" US stance is, however, the 38th parallel was drawn in Washington without regard to the Korean people wanted or needed whatsoever. The Russians supported North Korea, but never occupied it like the US did the South. The Chinese supported North Korea, but again, never occupied it like the US does South Korea.

Korea wanted to be free from everyone at this point, but the US did not want that because they saw opportunity in Korea (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLVp8n3ZMMU&amp;t=331s ). Also because WWII ended abruptly, the US economy needed war to continue to feed its war machine economy. 

Korea wanted to do away with Japanese conspirators that took over Korea during the occupation, but the US left them in place, and gave them even more power, because it gave the US power, control, and monetary benefits. Even to this day, all three major S. Korean news agencies are remnants of Japanese occupation and all three are heavily conservative, like Fox News, and are all affiliated with the conservative parties of government, to the point of conspiracy. 

The US took over Korea from Japan, that is technically an invasion, no? That is when the conflict started for Koreans, the Korean people wanted to set up their own government, and were stifled and killed for it on the South Korean side, and the US established its own puppet government with Syngman Rhee, a traitor to the Korean people who died in exile. Why? Because the US is quite greedy, Rhee promised and gave them mining rights, mineral rights, property rights, the works. Why do you think modern South Korea is so gentrified? 

So ""Communism"" gives the US a right to do whatever the fuck it wants, eh? Kill millions and tell them what is good for them? The Korean war was a Korean Holocaust at the hands of Americans. 1950's tech was poor and documentation poor as well, but I personally believe the numbers to be over 5 million Koreans dead.

So you think this concept of ""Communism"" is worse than invading a country, killing their best and brightest, and enslaving the rest by way of indentured servitude into a capitalistic system that already has an established hegemony, is better than just leaving some people on the other side of the world to govern themselves, which is all they ever wanted? What exactly has communism done to you? What is communism? Why are you so personally afraid of it? China is communist, why didn't the US try and split China in half? If you look closely at Vietnam, it absolutely was not Communism that ultimately brought the US into that war either. That's just what was sold to the American populace.

There are sources, you just aren't looking hard enough. Ever consider why the US only recognizes a single incident? Isn't it odd that there were numerous skirmishes that occurred before the ""official"" Korean war started. The US is worse than Japan in denying its own war crimes. There was a huge coverup of US war crimes in Korea and Japan. https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-korean-war-the-unknown-war-the-coverup-of-us-war-crimes/23742

Even consider the wiki, the picture depicts something, but there is missing text, I wonder why... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_sexual_violence#Korean_War

https://iacenter.org/Koreafiles/ktc-civilnetwork.htm

Hundreds of thousands of hapas children were born in S. Korea an abandoned. Korea was a lot poorer, and back in the 50's, it was almost impossible to document such crimes. If you consider that in many provinces, nearly every Japanese person over a certain age, knows someone, or was themselves raped by an American serviceman, you'd realize that an even poorer, and more vulnerable Korea suffered quite worse. Consider the sheer number of war brides that were taken from Korea specifically.",1519862717

It was a bitch to enforce so one day a few years so I slackened up on the rules, created /r/songwriterscircle and pretty much ignored this place for a few years.   Now I'm back and I'm trying to make change with the time I can afford to spend on it.

It was always for critique.

That was a message just for you, now...

I'm gonna respond this to everyone that posted in this post:

Can you guys help me put together a set of rules?   I'm a very hands off moderator, but I recognize the problems you bring up and I'm willing to fix them and enforce things.   I just have no time or inclination to write a set of rules.

Can you so collaborate on this thread, out together a set of rules and I'll try them out for a while, we'll see how it goes.   

My two cents:

* A song title in the post
* I'm hesitant to insist people put a genre, that's really hard sometimes.
* I fully support indicating if it's not a full song
* I support asking for specific feedback, I wouldn't want to enforce it.

Don't respond to me, talk together in the post.",1519862718

But let's put things in perspective for a moment. 

If the ""horn"" is a piece of BB's helicopter after the explosion, then how could the horn also be made out of archaea ? 

Most likely the horn WAS removed, but then an archaea horn was put in venom's skull and this gives venom a white eye from the parasites. 

What good was putting in an archaea horn? 

Perhaps it was used for the mind control, like an antenna, like a radio, and there are a lot of radios used for controlling the parasites in TPP.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt;One of Scion’s biggest advantages in Gold Morning was he was able to make himself immune to a lot of the attacks because he just made the shards unable to affect him. He’s got no way to turn off half a dozen Kryptonian lasers non stop.

Source? I don't remember that from the story

&gt;Khepri says that she has very rough time controlling everyone, they move awkwardly and most of them are regular people speed, yet she manages to have many dodge Scion’s attacks

For most of the fight between Khepri and Scion he's just playing around. At no point in that fight is he ever actually physically threatened. Even Sting + the tinker superweapon would never actually be able to harm him unless he ignored his automatic PtV which stops him from being hit by anything that can actually properly harm him.

We are trying to set the system up in a way where we will owe everyone money to start.  That way when people initially buy in they are guaranteed to break even.  Although, that means a greater risk on our end.  Plus there is no guarantee that we couldn't run away and just find a nice island to settle on.

Besides that though, we kinda just have to weather the storm I think.  Someone will call us a scam.  Just have to hope enough people believe.  Its the smallest thing that can dissuade someone though.  Like if our website is trashy.  It pushes some people away.

* Coins of Ebizu artifact
* Chest of Contentment artifact

My old best friend (Katie) recently told me that our ""friend"" (Amy) (who I had already cut myself off from because I don't trust her and she's truly a horrible person) did this... Amy was cheating on her boyfriend. A third party told the guy she was cheating with that she had a bf, she blamed Katie, even tho it wasn't her.
She pretended to be depressed (I suffer from depression, I know she was lying) and then told her that she downed 50 ibuprofens. After a while Amy stops texting her back. Katie decides to call the police for a wellness check or whatever. Amy still hasn't texted or anything despite Katie telling her she was going to call the cops. 
They show up to her house, and the dumbass is fucking fine and has to tell the cops she was lying. 
She had to be kept under 24/48 hour observation bc she had threatened to kill herself (not to the cops, but just in general). 
I honestly think she has some sort of borderline personality disorder.

Then Trump will tweet ""I have always steamed my own pants, I know how to use the machine better than anyone, believe me. HUGE steam control!"" After consulting some chicken bones that have been cast in the dirt, Trump's loyal followers will determine that coal is out, steam is in, and a new steampunk era begins.

Why does that matter? It is now a service where the artists can opt in or out. That is a very important difference, and that's a big part of why Metallica were against Napster yet they chose to be on Spotify.

Title: **My brother is getting divorced and his wife threatened him if he doesn't give her everything she wants in the divorce agreement.**

Original Post: 

&gt; My brother owns a small company which is mostly a cash business. He does everything legit so he says she doesn't have a case against him, but my question is, is her threatening to report him to the IRS if he doesn't give her everything she wants in the divorce blackmail? And if so should he tell their lawyer about it? She sent the threat over text message if that matters.

Also what they did in utah is trash.  Guns have lots of liability. They actually put in the law that you cannot sue the school and that if a teacher uses a gun, the teacher has 100% of the liability.

A teacher would have to be insane to carry a gun, if they even draw it, they can be sued personally by everyone around them.  The school isn't going to get involved in that suit, the teacher would have to defend it on their own.

So imagine being sued for false alarms and having to prove you had justification to draw or shoot the weapon? 

If you want teachers to carry, you must give them badges, immunity from the law, pensions, health benefits, overtime pay, a strong union, immunity from being fired, etc.  Everything a police officer has.

Which means the school pays for all lawsuits, just like how departments pay out for suits against officers.

in California especially, people are more bark, less bite. people will cuss all day and make comments under their breath if you cut them off on a sidewalk or in a bar. the second you grab a dude, shove someone, or escalate it to a physical confrontation, people seem to back down and go to great lengths to avoid conflict like cussing you as they leave a bar or something. (not that i go around looking for fights, just an observation)

in the south, the moment someone touched someone else, the entire situation would have turned physical.

A deadly weapon, sometimes dangerous weapon, is an item that can inflict mortal or great bodily harm. By statutory definition, certain items, especially firearms, are designated ""deadly weapons per se"", meaning they are regarded as deadly weapons no matter how they are used, from the Latin for ""by itself"". In addition, deadly weapons statutes often contain provisions covering other implements intended to be used to inflict harm.

The use or possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a crime often constitutes a penalty enhancer.

Thor has an endearing gentle humor to it, it's kind of in the pocket for me for just the right amount of levity. The movie is very character and story driven, and what action we do get is fun. I loved that introduction to the character. 

I was late to the party for the Nolan TDK trilogy, never watched any of the films until 2013. Maybe it just couldn't live up to the hype by then (for me)? Unfortunately Christian Bale has never felt like the Batman I have always imagined in my head. Not sure what else to attribute it to. I was left strangely unimpressed by Ledger's performance and the TDK movie s a whole. I did really like Tom Hardy and Bane and Ann Hathaway as Catwoman, though.

Still really hurts because traveling costs for people who don't get to make write offs makes debating if I can even afford to go.

Gandalf wanted it.  Saruman wanted it, even though his temptation, having never been actually near it, was presumably weaker: he was just less wise or else less self-disciplined.  Gandalf was wise enough to reject it, knowing that if he took it, even freely offered, the temptation would grow beyond his strength to resist.  Like an [alcoholic who has promised to stay sober but is then transported in the back of a beer truck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGOwbmuzZIE).

This spwedball was the most intense god damn shot i have ever done in my entire life. Almost immediatley i had a bellringer and my vision split into two. I could not even tell it was double vision i was so fucked up. I saw a streetlight, as i was trying to go from a parking spot to my buddys place to hang out for a while, and i totally thought it was car headlights heading towards me. I ended up just parking the car cause i could not drive it to save my damn life even in the neighborhood. My buddy asks me if im gonna be ok and i tell him yeah yeah im fine. He wanted to go do something with his friend real quick but was gonna come back, but he didnt want me going inside looking that fucked up so i just chilled in my car. By the grace of god, his buddies car blew up (no oil lol)  when he tried starting it again in my friends neighborhood. So my friend comes back to my car and he said he saw me just sitting there starring off into the distance, but i was stiff as hell hardly breathing and wasnt responsive. I just remember waking up from what seemed like being passed out and when i said what he was like wtf are you doing man i thought you were like dead youre eyes were open but you looked and seemed out. I fell out after having a breif convo with him about what just happened again so he ran inside and got a glass of icewater and threw it on my face waking me up again. He and his friend drove my car to the gas station to get some cigs while keeping me company. The ride was like pure fucking hell, i have never been that hot in my entire life. I took almost all of my clothes off in the back seat except for my boxers and i was still sweating like crazy and feeling like i was burning alive. Rode it out though and made it to the other side of it, felt practically fine but still fucked up by the time i got back. The coke was strong AF and so was the boy, but ive never heard of an OD like that. Looked it up the next day, apparently if you od on boy you can pass out so fast thay your eyes dont even close. Also cocaine overdoses causes extreme heating (cant remember medical term, hyperthermic?). Im extremely lucky lol, didnt even get checked out by any medical proffessional that night. Scared the absolute shit out of me though, honestly my friend really shouldve called an ambulance or taken me to the hospital but he despises medical intervention because of massive debt he got from a few hospital visits so i guess his policy is to only call if he ""has to"".",1519862729

What you are suggesting is more of a realtime coahing session. Which ls coach sometimes does. But it wont give that player a 80% winrate. You simply cant put what a high elo player is thinking into words fast enough. Much less would the silver player understand what he really has to do. Sure, you'd improve his winrate and he'd improve but a 80% winrate is just unrealistic for that. You can only give simple commands like 'trade' in lane for example. That doesn't mean he's doing it right. After he did it wrong you can tell him what he could do diffrently.

So a high elo player playing an almost non mechanical role with the least mechanical champions possible is the only way to achieve that kind of winrate while proving the point.

Of course to some the region is still occupied since no peace treaty has ever been signed with the Latin identifying occupational force that held it from 70CE to 1948CE (using their calendar), but I prefer a two state solution as they have become settled in the lands much like the Americans who overthrew the British to occupy the USA in their stead; so I'l agree to recognize a State of Palestine on the human factor alone if Palestine will do the same for Israel.

~~~

Alternatively, if we allow for religious/ancient context (which I shy away from as most modern scholars would not accept it as fact) then Yisrael is literally the lands of Jacob from which the Jewish people are descended and was entitled to him through Abraham who received the title-ship through Shem who is the central figure for title-ship to Semitic lands. The linage of Ham invaded the lands of Shem seeing their weakness and forced the linage of Shem to cover their nakedness by establishing a line of titles proving ownership of the land. Terah was sent to raise troops to protect the lands Canaan to secure them with title while ""the earth was still divided"", or the Cretaceous period, which is referenced in the Torah but made it as far as Iran before Abraham took over and descended into the lands of Canaan. The linage of Ham came unto lands once it was no longer divided by water as it is presently so that when Abraham arrived the tribes of Ham had already invaded. The native people of from Shem who lived in Canaan raised up Abraham and he was given great wealth by them and even secured the native title to the Levant for 7 Ewes which was passes to Jacob (Yisrael) and the lands of Jordan or to the east to Ishmael, or more exactly at least as far to the east as it was to the boarder of the lands entitled to Japheth who was also forced to draw-up title-ship paper work by the linage of Ham.

Either way there is no crying. The title-ship is clear and the issues that exist between the two regions currently are due to the meddling from the linage of Ham who have been attempting to gain control of the lands since the Cretaceous period and have been rebuked by either ourselves or our cousins as it is not their land and is our shared duty to protect them. The title-ship between the linage of Yisrael and Ishmael is also just as clear which is why not every Arab nation is against Israel. They know what is up and the issues that are there are very specific to very specific events that are unrelated to the title-ship of the land itself and arise more-so for the doing of Ham forcing us to cover our nakedness by putting paper to something that is literally native to us. Hence why a word of from the linage of Ham has been used to describe the lands rather than one from the linage of Shem.",1519862730

"ArtemisFowl","t5_2tqz5","If you really want to be optimistic, here's the way: 

The casting can be more or less ignored, because we've had movies with odd casting choices turn out phenomenally anyway. Production issues are no big deal as long as the end product arrived more or less in one piece (see: Rogue One). Squishing too much source material in too little time? This one's harder to get past, but if they have inspired and talented writers, they don't have to squish material into two hours so much as they just flat-out rewrite the first two books (a doable endeavor) into a completely new introductory story that leaves the characters in the same place as at the end of *The Arctic Incident*. There's really nothing wrong with it being a Disney film, considering that Walt Disney Pictures has a pretty decent (okay to good, more or less) track record, especially in the last decade or so.

Those are the justifications. I doubt all of them will happen, even though one of them might.

But hey, look at it this way - it's been a long time since the books came out. Those are in the past. You never expected a movie to get  made anyway, so even though it's a decade-plus overdue and probably going to be average, you'll get to close out that chapter of your childhood and fulfill your younger self's wish of seeing Artemis Fowl on the big screen.

You shouldn't try to defend your use of a slur that's commonly used as a derogatory term against black people if you're not the one who's often thought of when the word is said.

Now, while this is a common problem with white people, I actually see this more commonly with hispanic people.  Being half mexican as well, it baffles me to see how many non black hispanics try to justify their use of ""nigga"" by them being a minority as well, so it's okay.  Like no Bitch, it's not okay just because you're also marginalized to use that word as a term of endearment.

Yes, our digestive system is mostly an herbivorous one.

Our teeth aren't purely made for plants though.

Yes, we can open our jaw sideways, something herbivores do to grind vegetable matter, something carnivores dont have to do, their jaw can only open up and down, because they tear flesh from their prey, and gulp it pretty much immediately.  But, teeths used for a plant based diet dont have the same form that ours do.  Selenodont and lophodont teeth would be what you call ""pure herbivores teeth"".  We have bunodont teeth, mostly found on animals with an omnivorous diet, such as bears and raccoons.

"BostonBruins","t5_2rmt9","Great comment and analysis of the play that many are questioning. It seems to me, in my experience anyways, that most of the hatred comes stems from Carlo being 6’5” and not playing very physical. Fans wants him to be something he’s not, and it’s the same thing that many lamented Hamilton for when he was here. Big-body defenseman who rarely went out of his way to hit or make contact with others. Different skill-sets, of course, but the same mentality— focus on your strengths like skating &amp; puck-moving instead of banging bodies. 

Carlo has been fine, it’s Krug that hasn’t been stringing together many good games and that pairing hasn’t been working for quite some time now. I like Krug more than most, but he needs to be better and make better decisions. 

When it comes to Carlo’s “mistakes” and “bad plays,” do those criticizing him realize he’s usually the last player in the line of defense? The 

Aho goal was a perfect example of that, he drifted to the only uncovered player gaining the zone, it’s not his fault Kuraly gave up and allowed Aho to walk into the zone. There are mentions of his “awareness” in this thread, yet that play was an example of good awareness on his part. Once his man gained the line, F1 &amp; F2 switched off resulting in F2 going down the boards, then F1 seeing the passing lane because Kuraly lost coverage. Carlo was fully aware of that play and started to transition back and make a switch to the center of the ice. He got his stick in the lane too, but it got through. He was aware that the pass was coming, but he couldn’t stop it. Did he drift too far to the left? Sure, that’s a fair argument— but to blame him for that goal is looking for a scapegoat IMO. 

What are the better options than Carlo? Because I’ve yet to see any. I love McQuaid, but he hasn’t been very good the past few games he’s played in a similar role to Carlo. McQuaid has struggled with the speed of the game this season and has relied on his physicality, which hasn’t worked that well. Obviously, he’s still a viable 3rd-pairing D, but he’s not a 2nd-pair Guy. Fans want Carlo to be a shutdown, #1 defensemen at age 21 and it’s unrealistic. He is going to be a defensive-anchor to the 2nd-pair for a very long time. Just let him develop and take the good with the bad because there is plenty of good. It’s hard to notice all the good he’s doing while playing defensive-hockey with little flash or flair. 

I’m not the coach, and many would agree that’s a good thing I’m sure, but I would try this: 

33-25
48-73
47-86

Interchange 48 &amp; 47 however you’d like, but McAvoy &amp; Grzelcyk were d-partners their freshmen &amp; senior year at BU, respectively. They played very well together and brought a nice complement to their skill-sets. If those pairings don’t work, then so be it, go back to the original that’s been working. I just think something has to give right now until everyone gets back on the same page and brings their A-game every night. ",1519862732

We briefly touched what I was against. Let me requote myself since you don't remember apparently.
&gt;I do think weapons which cause mass death/injuries with a single pull/press/toss/hold should be heavily regulated/illegal. 

Should a person be able to own a tank and its rounds? Yes and no. Yes to a tank, no to the rounds. Have the barrel of the gun disabled. A tank is a vehicle which has armor. Should people be unable to buy armored cars for personal protection? Despite them having many credible threats by people who do many bad things including explosives. 

How can you bring up deferring things to the police when the shooting in florida had FOUR police outside who did nothing? Again, the only one responsible for your responsibility is you. The police do not have a constitutional duty to protect you. Even if the person is shooting the place with a  6 shooter, the police do not have to save you. The number of bullets per magazine doesnt matter. Someone will just carry more clips and do this new thing called reloading. Someone who *truly* wants a longer clip, will make one. ",1519862734

One thing that is really helpful is to know what’s going on in the world beside what’s happening to your players.  This way, you have something to say in most NPC’s interactions.  It makes the experience a lot more vivid!

Also, always keep a list of name with you.  This way, if you ever need to improvise a NPC, you won’t name a girl dwarf Philip.

This is what I think will make or break him. He was great on defense as a rookie but not very good last year (although you could attribute the loss of his friend to that).

Again doesn't matter if you have higher or lower stats you can still win in the battle the stats are a RNG sytstem. Example Kou Yoku is 91 out of 100 so that means 91% of the time he will achieve what he wants to get done. Tou has only a 5 % chance higher at 96. This slight percent isn't enough to make Tou auto win every single time thats now how the stats work.

Rin Bu Kun was already in a duel before hand and still was able to have a decent duel with Tou landing some heavy hits on Tou nothing to good since he uses a mace and if that hits you, you are going to die compared to a sword being able to nic you showing wounds.

&gt; The statute allows law enforcement to take possession of firearms, pending formal hearings, from people who are found to be statutorily “dangerous."" Indiana is one of only five states with similar laws in place. 

https://www.theindianalawyer.com/articles/46248-hill-points-to-law-allowing-seizure-of-guns-from-dangerous-people

 This is referring to a meeting that took place last Wednesday.  This is the law that Mike Pence was describing when Trump made his statement about taking the guns before due process, in the context of what he thought should have happened with Cruz.  Agree with him or not, but I don't think he's shooting from the hip and just making stuff up. He's making a statement based on opinions and facts that he's hearing from people, in this case, from his VP's home state.

I believe a majority started on *diverted* pain medication ...

Though I have a really hard time believing that the 30-day supply you had for a tooth extraction is what turned you into an addict ...

Even for those where they did start due to a prescription, the *vast* majority only really become properly addicted because they have found sources other than their doctor.

The thing is they are targeting doctors prescribing ""high"" doses to patients on chronic doses of opioids being treated for intractable pain.  When if there ever was a problem patient population ... or a problem with the way doctors were prescribing opiates ... it is *not* chronic pain patients.

I think 30-days worth of 15mg oxycodone after an injury or medical thing with pain that lasts at most 5-10 days ... is completely overkill and certainly poses the potential creating social problems due to over-exposing folks to opiates.

Though that tends not to be how things are framed when talking about this problem with medicine.  They instead target patients with the higher doses ... which really do have incredibly low rates of addiction.

The majority of people I know that turned their *chronic* pain treatment into an addiction ... ended up doing so because they were cut off by doctors unnecessarily .... leaving them with very few options and turning them towards illegal ways to access the medications they are dependent upon for the treatment of their pain.",1519862737

I'm not.

I think it's a societal issue. I think it's a recognition of the way in which we care about women, on a societal and even on a personal level to some extent, but we don't seem to care about men, certainly in comparison.

&gt;Women did a lot of work and a lot of activism and a lot of grassroots organizing to get funding for breast cancer research to be a priority.

Sure, but should it be a *priority*? I think that's what the article is ultimately discussing.

&gt;Are men doing the same for prostate cancer?

Again, men don't try to fix portions of society or their community when they're given problems, they seek internal resolution. Men try to solve their problems on an individual level, which is useful for creating independent, self-reliant individuals, and has a lot of utility in a society, but that also means that they need champions when they're dealing with issues that they can't take care of via self-reliant means.

I'm just saying that men should be advocates for these things, but those men need help in being advocates, too.

If nothing else, it would be nice to see women stepping up for a man-centric problem and help men to feel like they're valued. As a man, it feels like when your problems are validated by women and recognized and worth of attention rather than the much more normal hushed tones and invisibility.",1519862738

Not usually? You have to be pretty ignorant of history and dismissive of historically feminine contributions to think this is a deep or meaningful statement.

I usually respond something along the lines of how sad it is society spent so much time oppressing women who could have been adding to those accomplishments, while forcing men who would have been happier doing something else to fill more ""masculine"" roles.

Sometimes this gets the response that all these historical achievements show men are superior or women are naturally less capable and whatnot. To which I usually say that sounds silly, and share some anecdotes of women I know who are impressive at what they do. In particular there's a woman at my work who is just by miles ahead of everyone else in her knowledge and creativity, and my ass has been saved by her clever ideas a dozen times.

Pogba with hunter is way way way superior in offence , Pogba with shadow is close to savic about defending but way superior in offence.

Any player who've play a lot with Sif Savic  &amp; pogba say the same. BUT ! for people who've already pogba , and can't get good midfield icons ( blanc/petit/vieira/guillit...... ) then yes 8 chem Savic is a good option if u like Tall/Tank player . But Nif Vidal/Nif nainggollan are better overall than him as CM , and he is better as CDM but is a bit wasted here .


My only problem with savic is his price. For a player very hard to link , playing under his stats when you can have vidal for 90k , nainggollan for 90k and pogba for 260k , his price is too high . Sif should cost 100-110k and Tif 150-160k .


Too much hype from youtube , savic was at 70k at his release , When people will realise he play under his stats , pogba/vidal/nain are just as good as him ( or better ) and also easier to link , his price will drop .

You can get an appointment in the next 4 hours in SF, itl cost you $300, you might call 20-30 folks in network there before you find someone who has availability for your insurance in the next 3 weeks.  Folks I know up there describe it as ""Grindy"" constant work to keep the lights on.  

There is a massive disparity to it though, and it is pretty big.  Folks in private practice there were wealthy enough to do it in the first place.  You need care but can't find an appointment anytime soon because you can't afford the cash pay session, that means in practical applications whole segments of your economy are priced out of healthcare.  

The Ins Comission says ""Unacceptable, fix it"" I used to have to file complants against US when I worked in the network when someone even mentioned they had a hard time finding someone, its taken seriously, but again, many of us won't like the solution.

Networks are going to automate as much of that as they can to solve access, that means telehealth capable, reliability, and cost are your means to stick around.

System works fast, not Oneplus 5T level fast but comparable to Mate 10 Pro, maybe Pixel 2 XL. But the 120Hz display really makes a difference and everything looks so much smoother but at the cost of every stutter being more noticeable.

In gaming it performs about just well as any S835 phone. While the copper heat pipe helps in comparison to other flagships, the phone still throttles after ~20 minutes if you really push both the CPU and GPU. Hard to notice in a lot of real life scenarios, though.

Stereo speakers are amazing, on-board DAC seems to be run of the mill flagship one. Haven't seen anyone complain about it or praise it too much.

Not worth it at its current price IMO due to 2018 phones with S845 and 18:9 displays releasing shortly and still hard to recommend over cheaper S8+, Mate 10 Pro or especially OnePlus 5T. The savings are also hardly worth it when compared to Note8 or iPhone X/8 Plus.

Seriously though. I'm pretty sure nobody here wants you any harm. I for one sincerely hope that you do not fall victim to this scam. Take a step back and read the FAQ and the whitepaper.

The whitepaper makes it pretty clear what the goals of STEEM are:

&gt; Eliminating “abuse” is not possible and shouldn’t be the goal. Even those who are attempting to “abuse”
the system are still doing work. [...] All that is
necessary is to ensure that abuse isn’t so rampant that it undermines the incentive to do real work in
support of the community and its currency
&gt;
&gt; -- https://steem.io/SteemWhitePaper.pdf

The goal of STEEM is not to create an even playing field for people to get rewarded for their work but rather to limit abuse to such a level that the community at large still participates. In other words you are ripped of.

I guess MAYBE theres enough company cars that a driver can finish his shift the previous day then take the car til the next day. I'm fairly sure that Merseyrail use this company http://www.westwallasey.com/go/Fleet-Rental and most of their company cars are the likes of 1.2 Corsa's which probably cost a couple of hundred quid a month each so if they have say 25 cars solely for the first driver of the day then that's about 5k a month. As it's fleet hire they just need to put petrol in them, the car company (west wallasey) covers breakdowns, insurance and all that. 

They would rather probably pay the 5k to make sure the driver gets there on time than risk a load of unhappy passengers demanding refunds and the company shares dropping and stuff if the train was cancelled because the driver couldn't get in. 

Of course i'm only summising at numbers and costs but I know i've seen a load of small cars with 'merseyrail' logo's on the side with 'west wallasey' rear view window stickers so it would make sense to me that's their business model.",1519862743

For me postulating things that can not be measured or known, and are not actually needed, just so you can have some kind of misguided intuition is not a good way to approach science. I think it was Popper that gave a strong reasoning behind this line of thought. It kinda reminds of the modified Aether theories people were trying to come up with just so they still had an Aether that was fine tuned to what SR and GR were predicting. Sometimes we need to abandon our old ways of thinking because they act as frame that severely limits us. 

We also had the argument you mentioned about the simplicity of the equations. Won't occam's razor, although not a law but a rule of thumb, be in favour of the theory with the least postulates that leads to the same results. Maybe the difference is like using Newtonian mechanics, Lagrangian mechanics or Hamiltonian mechanics.

My professor totally butchered occam and proposed that the wavefunction collapse requires a bigger leap of faith than absolute time/ Universal frame of reference. I've actually picked up a good book: The Structure and Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, R. I. G. Hughes. That I got recommended by another professor, gonna look thru it when as a side read.

At 1 you might be in for a fight (we were). 

One thing that helped us is to do your bedtime routine, read some books etc and then read a book in bed, turn out the lights and tell them a story for 5-10mins in a slow comforting voice.  Make them lay still and encourage them to close their eyes while you tell it.  If they are still awake after the story tell them you need to go check on mommy or the dog or whatever but you love them and you'll be back to check on them.   Hopefully they will be out a min or 2 after you leave.

"progun","t5_2vtr4","&gt; I can’t speak about Rights in a global scale. They mean different things to different folks. For many generations in America, this meant those self-evident Truths endowed by our Creator, that were written into law so that we would be protected from government interference into our law-abiding daily lives. This is what it still means to me and I’m guessing that is also the case for many other Americans too. 

So the creator just plan forgot about black people, native americans and women. Those had to be added in much later including requiring a war to get one. How about Dreamers? You know the people who were brought here illegally as children when they had no choice. Have grown up, become productive members of society and even married and started children of their own. Having their entire lives they have build and families they have made torn apart because they didn't pop out of their mother at the right location? For profit prison system that doesn't correct the bad behavior that brought them in there but treats them like animal enforcing the negative behavior. While at the same time enforcing the idea in society at large that if you go to prison you absolutely can't be trusted making getting a job overly difficult and pushing them right back into crime which results in them going back to prison. Draconian laws with mandatory sentences that treats a guy caught with a few ounces of drugs like a drug king pin. Repeating the cycle over and over again simply to line the pockets of the people in charge. 

&gt; Our Rights have limits when we use them to bring harm to others. This includes threats. You asked about free speech. When our speech becomes so vitriolic that it invites riots or civil unrest because we are encouraging harm to be done, we will lose that Right. The same is true about inciting fear by causing others to assume their life is in danger when we know otherwise. The oft-used example is yelling “fire” in a movie theater. 

Explain the fuck how the likes of Alex Jones hasn't been thrown in prison yet. At his best he is a snake oil salesmen who creates fact problems like the government putting stuff in the water that will turn you gay. Then sell the solution to the imaginary problem. At worst he is a vile human who should be strapped underneath the next Falcon launch and burned into nothing but ash for making statements like Sandy hook and Stoneman Douglas shootings were false flag operations thus giving his followers reasons to harass and threaten the parents and survivors of those tragedies. He repeated claimed a pizza joint was really a secret democrat pedo ring resulting in one of his viewers to go there with a rifle to expose the problem. Luckily nothing came about and when he realized Alex was so full of shit he peacefully surrounded to police. But is actions and words encouraged and supported that person to take that action and it could have easily ended much worse.  Not only has he crossed the line he has had physical relations with it's wife and shit on it's car. And even worse we currently have a POTUS who actively associates with him. Giving his insane ramblings even more credence and support. 


&gt; Equally important to understand is that the government does not grant our Rights. They are ours by our birthright. We have consented to be governed and our government has consented to acknowledge their limitations with respect to our Liberties. We even have a process written into the Constitution whereby we can call for a Convention of the States to make fundamental changes to our federal government. 

Why are they just our birthright and not everyone's birthright? I point you back towards Dreamers issue. I also point you towards for profit prison system that help keep the cycle going as it is better for their profits. There are many other examples but those are just more obvious examples.  If something stops at an imaginary line created by people they aren't birth rights. They are a set of privileges determined by birth. And unless the Creator is a massive gaping ass hole they wouldn't be isolated to select people simply due to accident of birth. 

This is why the argument about it is a basic right is meaningless to me. Owning a gun isn't a right it is a privilege. A privilege people try to claim is a god given right by pointing to an old paper who's creators said all men are created equal then continued to own slaves, treat native americans terribly by taking their land and killing them and treated women like second class citizens who weren't even allowed to have a say in the politics of the same land they lived in. And even those that were against slavery didn't make a big deal out of it because they wanted the political advantage of the support of people who did support slavery. This is the reality. We fought a war because we didn't want to pay money. Not because British rule resulted in people being taken from their home country and sold like a pig to be worked to death and treated like shit by the rich (usually white) land owners who created whole and false medical conditions to validate why they are superior to black people and why those that tried to escape weren't unhappy just sick. 

Calling it a birth right that has to be protected is deflecting the argument and creating a strawman. It is the same logic path used by people who try to declare homosexuality as bad and should be illegal. And when they can't put forth a reasonable argument they invoke god because you can't argue against god's will because he is all knowing. So now it becomes a god given right declared by the constitution even though society is and always has been build on bending those basic human rights. From a little to the point the back of their head touches the back of their feet.  But for some reason giving someone the ability to kill another person from 50 feet away is the only one we can't bend or question. Mean while we tell Syrian refugees who have already been threw an exhaustive checking process to go fuck themselves as they seek the basic right to not be killed and to live a normal life. Simply because they aren't american.

Not all shooters suffer mental illness. Stoneman Douglas shooter planned everything out. He even planned to escape with the students running away.

[This latest roundup](https://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/best-smartwatches-for-women) to be fair looks promising, although many of these aren't out yet and only two are listed as being smaller than the PTR which is already the biggest diameter my Mrs would wear.  Also, none of them list a thickness under the PTR's 7.5mm which again is pretty much an upper limit if you don't want to look like there's a sundial bolted to your arm.  And that's not even a like-for-like; the small ones are things like the Nokia which barely has any smart functionality at all, let alone stylish colour always-on faces and voice reply.

For those who were following these were very competent years in the grand scheme of things. If you look at the full list of PS Plus Vita games since 2012, you'll see that a fair percentage of Vita's most notable games have been PS Plus titles at some point. Can't complain much.",1519862748

In general ergativity is when the intransitive subject behaves like the transitive object in some way, while the transitive subject behaves differently. If English put intransitive subjects after the verb (Sleep I) it would have ergative word order.

Languages can have ergative verb agreement, nominalizing suffixes (US English -ee as in ""employee"" functions ergatively), or relativization too. It's all about how the three verb arguments S, A, and O are grouped together in their behaviour.",1519862748

Personally I’ve gotten to a point where I feel pretty comfortable driving and smoking a J but I’m also an almost daily smoker.

I would wager that once their reputation precedes them for horrific incompetence (a gearbest employee here on reddit accidentally leaked customer information by uploading an excel spreadsheet, and gearbest was also hacked recently and didn't acknowledge it or inform their customers) and poor customer service, they will simply change names in a year or two.

That's why gearbest is only a few years old, as I'm sure they have been in business for a long time, but under a different ruined brand.",1519862750

Not everyone has that support to become successful. Art I think is essential for our species. We need to support our artists by encouraging them but also by being realistic with them early on so they know it may end up being a fun hobby and not a livelihood.  Also: those who have made it in professions such as yours should not poo-poo those making a living doing shit like weddings. That egotistical attitude killed my personal art field of blacksmithing.

&gt;Is India's right to own nukes to protect themselves against international bodies like the Pakistan similar to my rights to protect myself against a hostile forces? 

So there are two distinctions I'd like to make. One is the distinction between North Korea and India, which I think we agree on. The second is the distinction between the rights of the individual and the rights of a nation. I do think that both have a right to self-defense, but nuclear weapons are unique in their ability to potentially wipe out a significant portion of the human race in a short amount of time. It's not just the threat of intentional use either, we've seen on several occasions during the Cold War that their mere existance poses an threat to civilization as we know it. In order to possess such terrible capability, a country should demonstrate not just a spirit of cooperation and good intent, but a record of stability and competence. I think the rights of the individual are much more clearcut, both philosophically (a person versus a collective) and pragmatically (the extent of harm a single person can do is very limited as compared to a nation).",1519862751

Why are the laughably easy? Adjusting the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment to the digital age is still something were struggling with. As our infrastructure and daily lives become more entangled digitally these rights come under scrutiny as individual can do soical, economic, and physical harm through these new connections.

[Your stats there are from the mass shooting tracker, which is casting the widest net possible to push a political agenda.  It literally came from the GunsAreCool subreddit. It's creator rorschach was quoted as saying; “Billy Speed,” told me it was his choice: “Three years ago I decided, all by myself, to change the United States’ definition of mass shooting.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/opinion/how-many-mass-shootings-are-there-really.html?smid=re-share&amp;_r=)

For the record the FBI does not have a set definition of 'mass shooting'. It does have a definition of 'mass murder', 4 or more victims.

[*""The Congressional Research Service acknowledges that there is not a broadly accepted definition,and uses a definition of a ""public mass shooting""if 4 or more people are actually killed, not including the perpetrator, echoing the FBI definition of the term ""mass murder""*](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44126.pdf)

By these official metrics there have been less than 200 such events since 1966 with less than 1,100 total fatalities. While each and every one of these deaths was tragic these are extremely rare outlier events.

[More then 800 children die each from unitentional strangulation from bedsheets.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf)

So in m two year more children are killed by bedsheets than any American in any mass shooting in the past 50 years.

Besides that, [we are experiencing record lows for the homicide and violent crime rates in America after an over two decade long trend of decline](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm).

And there is a vehicle for change in the constitution. It explains what is needed to Amend it. You're free to advocate for repealing the 2nd Amendment through that.

It's purely coincidental, obviously, since it's not that the teacher was handed a gun and then promptly shot someone. I imagine this teacher had some serious shit going on in his head, and freaked out for one reason or another.

It does make a reasonable person take a good look at how having a gun in the hands of one of the most overstressed and underpaid people in the building full of kids might not be the best solution.

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","I'm bisexual, more inclined to my attraction to women than men. Growing up I was confused, I didn't want to like girls and wanted to be normal bit I was the kind of kid who just couldn't ever be anyone but herself no matter how hard at tried. So if over compensate and be overly girly because in my head, girly girls were straight. But that made me unhappy and when I managed to make friends with a girl, especially my crush, I started to act more boyish and dressed up like a boy because subconsciensly I wanted her to be attracted to me.

Then I went through this ""fuck it"" phase where I wanted to just ""accept myself"" except that wasn't coming to terms with being bisexual, that was just being a ""tomboy"", of course. So even when I tried my best to accept my sexuality, I was subconsciously adhering to the stereotypes people out on lesbians and bisexual..even in the LGBTQ community. That made me unhappy too.

It wasn't until my early 20s that I figured out that I could be feminine (as well as boyish) and be bisexual. That I didn't have to just ""pick one"" and be butch or overly ""straight girl TM"".

Sorry, I'm rambly because I'm high and I get a bit emotional about this. But people just want to put others in a box and it's worse when they want to put kids in that box.

A straight boy can want to wear a pink tutu, a lesbian girl can want to play with GI Joes and a bisexual kid doesn't have to adhere to any kind of gender roles/identity.

So... blink stalker all-in. Which already exists and can be defended.

This is so reductive. You can counter-attack the zerg, or open stargate, or open reactored mine. And this isn't even hard to test: I could go into editor and make the change fairly quickly.

Furthermore, the nightmare already exists: 4 oracles have 25 dps base, just as 10 mutas have 100 dps altogether. Feel free to explain why one-base double stargate isn't taking the world by storm.

"answers","t5_2qkeh","I have no idea, but I can think of many possibilities. The pictures could have been taken for medical research purposes or for the training of medical students, or as evidence in the case of a murder or wrongful death lawsuit. (You can find pictures online of just about any body part, diseased or otherwise, with just about any condition you can think of. Doctors and scientists have been taking pictures since photography was invented, and before that, they were making drawings. Mostly these pictures were kept in medical research labs or pathology labs, or published in journals that the public didn't have access to, but now that we have the internet, and Google is scanning everything, anything can be seen.)

The pictures could be decades old.

Medical ethics were not always what they are today. Doctors didn't always figure they needed to get permission, especially if they thought the pictures would never be made public, and the patient would never know the pictures had been taken--especially if the patient was dead.

The themes are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the legacy of colonialism, the destructive influence of African diaspora, U.S. imperialism, and black inner city struggles, most of the movie will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also the antihero Killmongers nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Malcolm Littles literature, for instance. The REAL fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of this movie, to realize that it's not just great- but it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Black Panther truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the ending, with the kid asking T'Challa who he was. All of my white friends saw that as just another superhero movie ending; pride at who you are and who you can be has more resonance with the black community because so much of our history has been shaped by what has been done to us rather than the other way around. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Ryan Coogler’s genius wit unfolds itself on their Movie screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Killmonger tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

"Accounting","t5_2qw2b","From what I've seen, there are basically three types of employers in the ERP space I work in. This is likely the case for other ERP tiers as well, but I'm not super knowledgeable about other markets, as I've never worked outside of the SMB space:

1) General accounting or consulting firms that have an ERP-implementation department. 

2) Specialized consulting firms that focus on ERP implementation and support.

3) Larger companies that utilize ERP systems and hire staff in-house to support their system.


The firms in group #1 are usually pretty large firms, and include the Big 4 accounting firms and many big consulting firms. The founder of our firm started his career at one of the Big 4 firms before breaking away and starting his own practice (which is now the firm I work at). 

One thing that I find interesting about this space is that it seems like these firms go through cycles of growing their ERP consulting business, and then selling them off, and then buying other ERP consulting firms, and then rinsing and repeating. 

Some of these firms also tend to work in multiple ERP spaces, so they have different sets of consultants that specialize in different systems. They also tend to have the same level of bureaucracy that you see at the Big 4 accounting firms. 


Group #2 are generally smaller firms that specialize in one or two specific ERP systems. This is the type of firm where I work. Some of these firms serve a specific vertical market, and some of these firms even develop their own software add-ons to the ERP systems they support. 

The firm I work at focuses on a single ERP system (and third-party add-ons that go with it), but we do not generally focus on a single market. We have some enhancements that we've developed for the system, and we do some level of customization to the system where needed as well. In some instances we partner up with a more vertically-integrated implementer for more complex implementations where the software involved (like specialty ISV modules such as Healthcare Management software, certain types of Manufacturing software, etc) requires an even more focused level of expertise, and then we support the base ERP and the vertical integrator supports the specialty piece. 

This group also consists of consultants who strike out on their own and run their own practice as a single contractor. Generally, they will be people who have worked for a few years at a consulting firm that implements a system, and decide they want to run their own consultancy. There are quite a few consultants in the Dynamics GP space that work this way, and they are often very, very busy people.

Groups #1 and #2 are a good place to get your foot in the door, and in some cases (like mine), some of these consultancies will hire directly out of college or University. There is generally a steep learning curve in the first couple of years of working with the systems, as there is a ton to learn, and not a lot of opportunity outside of actually working within and supporting the software to learn it. 

Group #3 are generally businesses, usually larger businesses, that hire staff in-house to support their ERP systems. In all but very, very few instances, getting hired as an in-house support resource requires you to already have a number of years of experience under your belt with whatever software they are using, because again, they won't have the time to wait for you to get up to speed. I've had a few colleagues move on from working in our firm to working in-house with some of our clients as employees. Some I've spoken to prefer to work in-house as opposed to working as consultants, and others have since bounced from company to company because there are other internal politics and bureaucracy to deal with in this scenario.

Your day eerily mirrors mine, except my sleeping cycle rotates throughout the day even though my alarm is set to 9am. There are times when I open photoshop and scribble some loose lines, but they always look garbage. I'll open an AoPs PDF and try and learn some algebra (Because I have this big theory that maths can be learned by anyone given the proper first principles thinking) but I can hardly get through a page before the mental effort to reward ratio topples any drive to continue. 

You've got so many things spot on. Not sad, not happy, but so content that nothing rouses me to action. There's this fleeting idea that there may be a balanced life out there, filled with challenge and reward. But the loop for so long was to engage with a challenge head on, and usually be disappointed with the results. Granted I'd complete it, but not without some compromise on quality or time, so I still came away feeling defeated. There was never a time when I felt like I'd 'nailed' something. Happiness doesn't have to be the goal, just at least enough interest in something that I can distract myself from thinking about it. 

&gt;These colleagues you speak of, you say they are interested with everything they can think of. This certainly can't be true, no one is interested in everything.

Not quite, my colleagues have their one or two things that they're passionate about and seem to have a bottomless pit of energy to explore those things. By proxy I end up learning a lot through them, because I'm a very good listener. (It saves me having to do the talking.) So often they'll explore their ideas by explaining them to me, come to an epiphany and continue working. I always come away from those conversations no more inspired than I went in, because even though listening to them gives me something to do, that's their white whale, not mine. 

I have a hunch that one of the things that makes people interested is the sense of agency over what they're doing. So often I feel helpless when trying to learn a new skill or master a current one. Like I have no control over my own rate of improvement, and therefore could be spinning my wheels for months without even seeing a lick of genuine progress. It's the same thing with my personality - I could have a job for a month where I'm responsible for 30 trainees, quit, and still end up the unmotivated bum that I started out as. Like who I am isn't conducive to what I want.

"uwo","t5_2rm2m","General first level courses often had hundreds of students. Not always, but usually between 60-300 enrolled. There's a strict cap on how many first-level courses you may take to count towards your degree. These are usually restricted to strict program requirements and pre-requisites. A majority must be in upper-level courses. If you ""need"" to take an unusual amount of pre-requisite courses than you must stay longer to complete the required upper-level credit count. So it becomes sink or swim quite fast. 

Second level you'd get a couple dozen in each course. Upper-level seminar classes usually had less than 10 students.

A fourth year would never take a first year course unless it was a program requirement they were putting off or a compulsory elective. ""Bird"" exist but they have to fit into your compulsory elective requirement which are different for every program (i.e., you literally have a set list of 15 classes you are allowed to make count as an elective, and some of them may be ""bird"" courses but you can't sub in a random ""bird"" course). The courses with highest enrollment are courses that are required for a given program and cross-listed by several other programs as suitable compulsory elective.

What is interesting though is the possibility of strengthen governance from top to bottom by using the Dapp Framework layer (with DAOstack for example) to enable decentralized co-design of governance protocols to secure (allow or prohibit) code alteration on the Dapp level (mitigating the risk of another ""DAO"" failure).",1519862760

You pretty much made fun of Edm and Mtl for having cap space like it was some obvious, simple thing they could do to fix their teams... but ignore any and all plans they may have for that space, or what's accounted for next season.

When that was brought to your attention you kinda doubled down with the idea.

Let's just settle on the fact that spending to the cap is conductive to competing in the NHL as a general rule. No question. I agree with you.

But you don't just do it automatically without some kind of logical plan. Habs have money to spend today, but that could all change next year with changes to the team, in addition to the increases for Price, Pacioretty, Galchenyuk and Gallagher over the coming seasons.

And that freedom didn't happen without some excellent cap management leading into the season. So they obviously know what they're doing.

I mean, let me put it this way... while I am talking to you about the Habs not spending to the cap, I am also arguing with people who are claiming they are totally fucked because of Price and Weber's contracts.

I feel guilty over every little thing. If I put the baby down to eat, I feel awful. If I don't sit and stare into his eyes while I feed him I feel awful. 
I just started pumping exclusively and feel like I'm selling him short. I could be doing better. This pumping schedule takes more time away from him, I just can't bare the pain of his latch anymore. 

I worry about my husband feeling neglected. I worry I boss him around too much. I feel guilty when my husband wakes up too many times before work. 


My mom comes and helps. I feel guilty my son isn't with me, I feel guilty my mom is watching him. Even if she asks everyday to come see him, I feel like I'm a burden to her. 

I feel guilty for (not even joking.. ) not coming to this sub everyday . I miss it. 


Ugh the mom guilt is real. 
I feel like I am taking care of a village when I am just simply taking care of my son. 


He has awful gas and barely sleeps because he's always pooping. Now I'm worrying if my milk is bad and I'm pumping too much foremilk , emptying to slowely. 


I cry every night. I wake up and feel better if I can get a little stretch of sleep from 8-11. 

I miss being pregnant sometimes. I miss my husband. I miss the daylight and how simple things were. I feel like sometimes I can't handle being a mom and I wasn't ready and now I'm stuck and won't be able to give everything to him. He's so tiny and innocent. My heart hurts when he cries.

Just don't go defensive because you're ahead, go defensive if the enemy team comp threatens you independant of your fed status. For example, against Sion, WW, Rakan, Aurelion, Tristana, go Mortal Reminder and Mercurial Scimitar. But against Galio, Malphite, Evelynn, Sivir, Janna e.g., full crit is viable with Deaths Dance.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Just another daily commute. On at Junction 23 and off at 26. I've done it every day for the past 14 months or so, so I've gotten used to it. The radio is blaring its usual hourly propaganda stunt, you get used to ignoring it if you acknowledge it at all. They all share common themes - the war effort is glorious, the country is prospering, the enemy is in retreat. All the normal stuff. But this was different. The voice on the radio said ""Attention, civilians! By lawful decree of Supreme Chancellor Sutler, the speed limit on all roads across Great Britain will be vigorously inforced! England Prevails!"".

'England Prevails'. Every time 'England Prevails'. No new moto, just the same boring crap for the last 5 years. It makes you pine for the days of democracy. Nothing but Norsefire now. ""England Prevails"" I whispered, not even considering that I was saying it. What right do I have to complain anyway? I voted for the bastards.

The radio changes back to playing music and I quietly scoff at the radio set. ""There aren't enough police in Britain to enforce laws on every road in the country. Just a bunch of rhetorical lunacy by Mr Sutler again"".

A car pulls up alongside me, a silver MG. He speeds up to overtake me and just as his rear passes my front near side wheel, the car explodes into flames! ""FUCKING CHRIST!"" I shout, violently swerving to get out of the way of the out-of-control-and-also-very-much-on-fire vehicle. I plough into the barrier on the hard shoulder as the car veers into the central reservation. All the traffic behind me stops, some pulling onto the hard shoulder and some just stopping in the middle of the lane.

I open the door and fall onto the tarmac. A woman rushes over to me. ""Oh my god, are you okay?""

""Yeah, I think I may have broken a toe or two."" I rebutted.

""DARREN! DARREN! CALL 999!"" she shouted.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","I agree. 

Astral Presence was nerfed all the way back during her 1st balance patch that removed Ess of Johan, and although mana regen below 50% was indeed insane, it was nerfed way too harshly (especially compared to the very gentle nerfs they have for OP heroes these days like Hanzo and Maiev). I think a boost to have mana regen below 35% would be adequate, but either way the talent needs to be looked at again.

Aether Walker could also use a nice buff, since it was nerfed quite hard indirectly with Calamity nerf. It's the most interesting talent in that tier IMO but it's a little on the weak side.

Another talent that needs to be looked at is Glass Cannon. The concept of sacrificing health for more power for a high-risk high-reward playstyle is very interesting, but 15% spell power is not enough especially when considering 15% max health malus that comes with it (nearly all talents in the game have no downside at all). Talent needs changing and I got some ideas about it but that's a talk for another time.

Most important change by far that Li-Ming needs is making Calamity baseline. The talent defines her playstyle so well, that without it she's 2/3rds the hero. The talent is needed 99% of the time to have a viable build. By adding it baseline, suddenly her  talent tree becomes quite liberated, and the viability of other talents increases in all tiers (since they have synergies with her other level 7 talents). Numbers for baseline Calamity damage can be adjusted as needed. Add a talent at 7 in Calamity's place that makes E deal damage to non-heroes and presto, she'd be excellently refined.

Also IMO it would be really nice to have WoF cast delay shortened from the current 0.3s to 0.1s to make the most skill-intensive playmaking possibilities a tad bit more possible.

I definitely think Li-Ming needs a few changes. Baseline Calamity is exactly what she needs to increase her talent diversity and a few teaks to some of her weakest talents would be perfect.

I’m aware that farming is a lot of work. I’m well aware of the sacrifices. I’ve been with FH for 5 years and we’ve spent an inordinate amount of time at the farm. He actually lived at the farm the first three and a half years we were together. I understand the work that goes into farming; I’ve done plenty of farm chores. I don’t think the world revolves around me and my wedding, but we have made every concession possible for them. We’re having the wedding in the “low” season for their farm. I just think it’s bullshit that every sacrifice, every expense is coming from me and my family. I don’t think it’s too much to come up for two days. I feel bad for my fiancé that his family is being so unsupportive and I feel like they give zero fucks about me or my family. 

I’m having to go that early just due to the nature of the venue. I was previously told they would help which is why I have to get there that much earlier. 

He also takes several vacations annually (2 week hunting trip, 2 week fishing trip, several sports weekends). I don’t begrudge him this; it tells me that time away from the farm is more than possible. 

Let me add: he’s retired and his pension is about $80k/year. He also returns for an event at his old job for two weeks, twice a year (he was a mechanical engineer at a nuclear plant). Due to the type of work, he makes close to $50k for that. I’ve also seen their investment portfolio. They aren’t hurting for money. ",1519862763

"DestructiveReaders","t5_2z15u","**Final thoughts:**

The perspectives are not used as well as they could be. There does not seem to be a need for them at this point. The difference  between them seems to be that information is left out of the perspectives, but not much new information put in. I would remove the perspectives or make them more unique.

Characters need more of an arc. They should end differently then they started. I'm sure they have changed, but it could use more material for that change. Examples of an arc for these characters off the top of my head would be 
Em: I love when you ask the question 'could Em take her on her offer and have Serra try to be with her because Serra feels she owes Em. A simple arc for her could be that in the beginning she never would force anyone to do that, but by the end of the story she does. 

 I feel your ending needs more of an explanation though. Maybe Em changes from the beginning and its because Michael killed that man, you see it made her feel very guilty because she feels like she now owes Michael. I mean Michael loves her and she does not want to be with him! But she has to now doesn't she? But you know what Serra owes her damn it! I mean she saved Serra's life just like Michael saved hers, so if she has be with Michael she should get Serra right? 

This kind of logic is insane but I could actually be way more satisfied with the ending provided it had more of  an arc for the characters. So ems arc would be that she has some sort of guilt and carries it all the way through never over coming it. Serra's arc is that she  becomes trusting again after being ruined by the streets, but she too falls victim to new captors. Michael's arc would be that he killed someone and he would never do that ever and punishes himself in the end by forcing himself into this relationship he does not really want. So the message would be that love sets you free, but guilt ruins love every time. 

Something like this provides a reason for the ending. Everything in the ending should come from the story, nothing outside of the story should ever be in the ending (even new information should stay out). All characters must change from who they were in the beginning, even if they decide not to change- that changes who they are forever and is still satisfying.

Overall I think my biggest problem with it is that I don't really see the characters reacting to what has happened before. 

I really did like that the story did have a lot going on. It did not fall into the prose trap but instead did have dialog and things happening-I just could n0t find those things believable  because there was not enough being drawn from what happened earlier in their lives or story. 

I also feel that I would like to see a little more description as I had a hard time telling where I was or where certain characters were at times.
Overall I hope this was helpful, if I came off to negative I'm sorry as that is never my intention. I did the best I could to review your work, I hope it helped.",1519862764

I rather just negate that chance overall whether through stacking decos or having a high affinity on my bow.

The Winterhilfswerk des Deutschen Volkes (English: ""Winter Relief of the German People""), commonly known by its abbreviated form Winterhilfswerk or WHW, was an annual drive by the Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (National Socialist People’s Welfare Organization) to help finance charitable work. Its slogan was ""None shall starve or freeze"". The drive was originally set up under the government of Heinrich Brüning in 1931, though Hitler would later claim sole credit. It ran from 1933–1945 during the months of October through March, and was designed to provide food, clothing, coal, and other items to less fortunate Germans during the inclement months.

"cookingforbeginners","t5_32u9b","Not OP but I would recommend Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat first (if you're only going to start with a single book). I got The Food Lab first and while it's fun and informative but it does tend a bit more to recipes, techniques, and explanations whereas Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat has 2 parts - the first of which is an expository exploration of the components in the title, the second is an organized set of recipes. 

I think The Food Lab a better book once you've started cooking a bit and want to improve. I think a lot of the recipes and writing in The Food Lab (while great) felt a little inaccessible or too advanced for me when I was starting out. That being said, Serious Eats (the 'chief culinary consultant' of Serious Eats wrote The Food Lab) is and has been my go to site for recipes and now that I'm a lot more comfortable in the kitchen, I like using The Food Lab more and more.

"visualnovels","t5_2r5yf","&gt; Clearly not the case.

Yeah, we already have direct proof I provided and discussed multiple times. 

&gt; And before you act like this is me conceding anything, think again.

AKA, you have no argument left and just want an excuse to save your ego. Given you changed your entire approach for the tenth time, its not unreasonable to conclude this, lol

&gt; You act like you've refuted my points over and over when that is simply not the case.

What points? 95% of your posts were just you flinging insults and literally ignoring what I just said.

&gt; Judging by the fact that every one of your posts is downvoted and every one of my posts is upvoted at the time of this post, I would say there's a high probability that the community at large agrees with me

Judging by the fact my posts went from 1 to -1 all around the same time... consistently... for hours... even over night... where no one would be sticking around for it...

Do I even need to say the obvious conclusion?

I was wondering when you'd try and pull out that handiwork of yours, lol

&gt; And you know what? Despite all the toxicity you flung in my direction throughout this discussion, I will still frequent this board every day as I do now, because my skin is thicker than paper, and I've been hanging around the internet for longer than 5 minutes.

lol, what? You have some weird superiority context and an emotional dependence on literal elitism, and you think that's remotely comparable to someone looking into something and decided there are better things to try?

Let's have a little list of what you've done here and the opinions you've claimed to hold to remind you... All of which you dropped eventually when pressed on...

- People who say it is a game don't count as believing its a game
- Your opinion is the overwhelming majority because you said so
- Your opinion is absolute fact because you said so
- Your opinion is the overwhelming majority because you got a handful of upvotes
- Your opinion is absolute fact because you agree with that opinion when thinking about it
- Everyone must think the same as the point above because you said so
- Any sources that disagree with you are **safespaces**
- The only opinions that count are the ones you see and agree with you.
- Everyone must know how ""great"" your life is when suggested you might not have a great one
- A little condescension and feelings of superiority is identical to the most alienating elitism
- People who choose not to deal with your toxicity just have ""thin skin""
- People who choose not to deal with your toxicity have nothing better to do, so it must be their personality at fault
- People who choose to spend their time investments because of conflicts of opinions with Elitists will just damage the conversation as a whole
- Elitism is preferable to treating people respectfully
- Referencing an outside source is the ""logical fallacy of appealing to authority""
- You think that your opinion on how to define a well known, notably debated topic is absolute fact because you said so.
- Exceptions to your opinion don't count.
- Its okay to ignore everything but the sentence you decide to quote.
- You think your opinion is factual as math.
- You think the opinion of those that agree with you and your surrounded yourself with are representative of the overwhelming majority of this community
- Opinions that contradict yours are slights against you (yes, you said having opinion you don't like harms others)
- That condescension alone is an argument
- Elitism is justified because were better off without those who dislike it (like literal villain cliches here, lol)
- You think your elitism is okay if you blind yourself to any ramifications

And probably some more. Feel free to give me some more to add",1519862769

"keto","t5_2rske","Meh, I don't really know.  

Ketoing since 2003 and I've had hundreds or thousands of folks track macros (scale tracking) and when we've taken them off of keto their body weight changes were nearly identical.  

I think fat adaptation from fasting is better suited to weight management long term (which is why I never tell someone to do keto until they've done IF 100% for at least 60 days) but I don't think keto or IF really aid in weight loss -- I think they both aid beautifully in hunger control and satiety signaling which lets people lose weight if they so-choose.

As to ""a portion of the population"", stop reading now if you don't like rants, lol:

I don't think a large portion of the population can be helped.  I think it's only going to get worse now that people are entitled to subsidized health care and don't have to control their diets.  I prefer that people learn through pain and loss than force others to subsidize poor behavior.

Keto doesn't change poor behavior.  90% of people who attempt keto still have shit addictions they refuse to break.  I've seen the numbers now for 15 years, it's only gotten worse.

10 pounds down (8 pounds waterweight) and it's now ""omg I just have to celebrate St Patty's Day because I knew a Irish person once, how do I get back into ketosis?""

Keto helps break food addictions for sure (over time), but as long as all the other addictions exist, keto won't save a large portion of the population from themselves.",1519862769

When fakes start getting better, I assume they will just be very very similar to these bape pieces that have a bit of a production variance to it.

I could have three of the same size, same piece, and they would have like 1-3% little tiny differences between them. 

When fakes start getting to 95% accuracy, at that point it would be near impossible to distinguish.

Regardless of your stance on guns, I think the implications of a simple law over powering an amendment should terrify everyone.  You're quick to grab guns because you think taking them away will stop crazy bastards from killing a lot of people, and so you're okay with that major overstepping of our constitutional protections.  

In allowing something from the bill of rights to be stripped away by a simple law though, you open the possibility to it happening again.  More high school kids have killed themselves this year than have died from school shootings.

While matters of the city were her own, the matters of war were left with the men, as it should be. Her husband seemed to fill the role quite nicely, which came as a slight surprise to her. She had not thought his mind so battle-ready.

When Lord Alaric spoke, his words decided what their move would be. It seemed war was in their future, and the peaceful growth she had imagined for her children would have to wait. As long as they were being attacked within the Vale of Arryn, there would be no guaranteed safety. She would have to agree with her Lord Uncle.

“Coin will be no trouble. Gulltown has been quite prosperous as of late,” Anya said, giving what she could. They would be able to support what troops they raised, but she did not want their fighting so near her city. “We can provide as many men as you need, [Uncle](/u/Reusus).

"wow","t5_2qio8",".05 yes. and with tiers and content patches as well

1. firstly, world pvp isnt as impactful or significant as battlegorunds for a pvp experience in wow. youll be able to queue for battlegrounds at lvl 10. arenas come much later, and world pvp is generally just ganking and the occasional world quest site.

2. a pvp'er can mostly subsist and level from battlegrounds just fine because every class has premade stat sheets that mostly equalize players

3.  discords are good for pvp groups. that and your arena rating

4.  there is always a place for a listener over a shotcaller in battlegrounds. but yeah communication is important. not sure about the soundboard keybinds

5. not very much. but it doesnt hurt, and you can use the dungeon finder just like queueing for battlegrounds. its relatively painless on normal and heroic.

6. there is durability damage to items. pvp deaths dont trigger that as much as a regular death, but you still get over time wear and tear. battleground/world quests income should cover that.

7. battlegrounds are generally objective oriented and stat sheet equalized, so allows for skillful play over numbers/gear ganking.

8. there is an honor system that gives you many rewards and unlocks honor talents as you level it once youve unlocked them at max level, but you wont get honor from dueling. pvp world quests at max level, battlegrounds and arena give this honor. world pvp kills give a very small amount of honor.

lots of players get by with just pvp'ing. and with next xpack, the way world pvp will change is looking to be for the better, where its an opt-in instead of a server-choice option.

Can you so collaborate on this thread, out together a set of rules and I'll try them out for a while, we'll see how it goes.   

My two cents:

* A song title in the post
* I'm hesitant to insist people put a genre, that's really hard sometimes.
* I fully support indicating if it's not a full song
* I support asking for specific feedback, I wouldn't want to enforce it.

"hockeyplayers","t5_2vs1b","Everyone has a strong side, even NHL players.

You have to work a little extra to get a skill on your weak side.  Everyone does.

Keep working on it.  Weight on your heels is one of the main things that turns a stop into a tight turn, so you obviously need to keep working on that so you have a degree of control over where you stand.   

Another thing that leads to heel standing is having very straight legs.  Do some off-ice stick handling and things where you focus on having a nearly 90 degree knee bend.  Don't focus too much on the stick handling, but regard this as part of ""leg day"" that has an added benefit of stick handling.  Your legs should burn doing this for awhile, especially if you move the weight around between your feet.

It's also IMPOSSIBLE to stand on your heels when your knees are bent.

It wouldn't surprise me if the mods here are being paid by pserver devs to allow this kind of blatant shilling (not just from Kronos), and it's simply a matter of which pserver is giving them the most cash currently, letting them choke the subreddit with advertisements for their server and vote brigading any of their competiton, then once the hype train has ended it just moves on to the next server.

This community has become a bunch of people constantly chasing a purple dragon in the form of fresh servers in the futile belief that this NEWEST server will somehow give them the experience that they had back in the day and want back, but then it innevitably fails because they can never truly relive it, so they drop that server and move onto whatever is currently being hyped up next, endlessly. 

Hence why every goddamn server dies within a year before they can even finish their content cycle for the next brand new server that opens. It's an endless cycle that ultimately stems from the sad truth that almost everyone is tired of the old game but are unable to come to terms with this because of, yes, nostalgic feelings they've associated with their old experiences with the game.

There is no ""legacy movement"", there is no massive group of passionate people who want the old game back, this ""community"" is just a sad group of individuals who cannot accept that this game is fucking old beyond it's ability to retain actual interest, and can thus never give them the experiences they had when they first began playing and experienced it long ago, and so refuse to move on, and a bunch of opportunists (the ones who profit in various ways from these servers) trying to make a buck out of these people who are laughing their way to the bank at their expense. That's the sad fucking truth that very few people here want to admit, but my own time with this community has made me realize that this indeed the reality.",1519862780

President Bozizé quickly lost control over wide partsof the CAR and for almost a decade didn't control either the north or the west partals of the country and in its final years merely controled the capital region. Some parts of the territories where under the control of warlords or of private ""businessmen"" with their private security forces, establishing road tolls, collecting taxes and preventing trade. They could exploit natural ressources if when possible, such as diamond mines. Several of them have been out of service since the 2000's, and if in activity, they are still today barely exploited by rebels groups using low efficient manual methods, from which the State get nothing.

To say it is sometimes more easier than that.

"FemdomCommunity","t5_2whne","I think this is well stated and the real issue is what happens when you evolve or discover a kink *after* you have committed to spending your life with someone? (I like to think of it as discovering my kink because I pretty much unearthed something that was inside of me vs. growing without including the other person—which can quickly get you into trouble in a committed relationship.)

If my kink was impact play, heavy bondage, cuckolding, or about a thousand other things, I know damn well that we would be practicing my kink 0% of the time. Thank goodness I got the chastity strain and my keyholder (for the most part) dominates me by default just by holding my key. The past 12 months have been great because we seem to have started to grow out of that default scenario but the first 4 years I was in chastity the whole dynamic was my cock being figuratively put on a shelf until she was ready to use it—and that was about the extent of the D/s dynamic for us.

For those who find themselves in the same place as OP (or even me without the chastity bent) the question becomes is the relationship you have more important than your kink? Hopefully the answer is, yes. But then of course you have to go without your kink.

If suddenly tomorrow I became single, my kink is important enough to me and a fundamental part of who I am that I would start there and try to find a partner through that. Of course, after a long enough period of time not finding a connection (I estimate that willing/natural keyholders are outnumbered by guys willing to be locked 25-30/1) I would probably give up my kink for a vanilla relationship.

"CGPGrey","t5_2u93l","I think Grey is looking at the Toronto nomination for the Amazon office in the wrong way. It isn't so much that Toronto is a ""token Canadian city"" it is more that Toronto is a carefully placed bet by Amazon to try and win big. 

While it is true that there is probably a 95% chance that the Amazon office won't be in Toronto, the 5% chance that it does end up in Toronto will involve a giant payoff to Amazon. This is because of how unbelievable the timing is for announcing this office. Toronto is literally the most important city in Canadian politics as over 15% of all federal election seats are in Toronto and they have a tendency to swing wildly. Elections in Canada are won and lost because of the GTA (Greater Toronto Area). The next federal election is next year (2019) and both the Conservatives and the Liberals are going to compete heavily in the GTA and the promise of thousands of new jobs in Toronto would be a perfect campaign promise for both parties. There is also the Ontario (province that Toronto is in) provincial elections happening right now. 

Also Montreal and Toronto have been fighting for years at this point to try and become the programming capital of Canada. Both provinces (Quebec and Ontario) already give massive subsidies to programming companies that set up shop in their provinces. 

Amazon might have been gambling to try and see if they could have gotten a massive tax break that no other city in North America could match. It was an unlikely scenario, but if the stars aligned then they could have easily gotten an unbeatable deal from Toronto. ",1519862784

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","On the ophid faces part, something I've thought about for awhile (and this is just speculation not supported by any lore) is that the Tsaesci men, based on their culture, would have been the ES equivalent of Asians. 
Therefore, their faces would look quite a bit different from the Tamrielic men. I've wondered if calling them ""snake men"" and ""vampires"" were just racial slurs based on their narrow eyes, flat faces, and different skin color. In addition, it would portray them as being treacherous, and the people of Tamriel definitely would have been uneasy with the former invaders, plus all the bit with Versidue Shae",1519862785

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","The KJV is translated from the majority texts-from the oldest most abundant manuscripts-the exact manuscripts you would expect to find from a church that had the preserved, beloved word of God and was copying them with perfect accuracy and spreading them abroad. There are nearly 5000 manuscripts in near perfect agreement-with differences only in things like spelling of words.

The modern translations are translated with *2* other manuscripts in mind that are vastly different and only assumed to be older and more authoritative **simply because they are shorter**. There is not without a single point of data to believe this otherwise. This assumption was made because certain scholars assume that since shorter manuscripts were found then that means that any other, longer manuscripts must be older and **added onto by man**. This assumption is made that people who were Christians living and dying by the word of God were putting words in God's mouth and putting things into His Bible simply because they thought it was good. 

I don't know about you, but I live my life entirely for Jesus Christ and I love Him and His words with all of my heart. I would never change them, add to them, or do anything over than make sure that my disciples get the exact same words that God gave me in His scriptures to live their lives by. Anything else is a lie. 

Furthermore God promises to preserve His word to us-to perfectly keep it unchanged. 

Psalm 12

&gt;6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

&gt;7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

Either Christians have loved God's word and kept it perfect and pure-just like God says He would-and we have His perfect preserved word translated to us in the King James Bible or we are constantly having to make human scholarly efforts to find and more perfectly get back the lost word of God and we have to keep making new translations based on our findings and our efforts.

- Teresa arrived at Avery's at 2:34pm and she was murdered at around 2:45pm. [October 23 Motion for Reconsideration page 43].

Zellner has refuted pretty much everything Buting and Strang presented to the jury and presented by MaM.

"JapanTravel","t5_2uylr","THANK YOU!! I was one of the people asking for a guide and was patiently waiting :3 This helps a ton!! 
A few questions I still have- 


I have a konami card I got from round1 here in California. Would that be valid to use with games in Tokyo? Will my account/scores show, or will I need a new card/account?


Next, by ""weird Horse Race Betting Game"", do you mean Derby Owner's Club??? I love that game!! It's a horse racing simulator where you breed the Mare and Sire to get your racehorse, then train your racehorse + feed it, and then compete in races to with the championship! After the race you can either praise it or discipline it, and you get money+gifts depending on how well you did in the race. It spits out a card at the end with your horse! Then you can continue to train your horse and eventually breed it and train the offspring :) 

A question similar to my previous one, does anyone know if cards from the English versions of these games work on the Japanese ones? So if I have my horse cards and try to use them, will they work? (not sure if anyone has experience but worth a shot)


And finally, at Round1 my boyfriend and I usually ask an attendant if a prize gets stuck/lodged in the ufo catchers- how common is this in Japan? Would it be rude to ask to get it fixed if the prize is too stuck to win without resetting it? 

Thanks again for the guide! ",1519862790

It's an elective program and one that they don't have to offer.  They only have to follow existing laws, not above and beyond.  

Everyone is given a fair opportunity to utilize the rewards program.  They can block movie pass participants because you have an unfair advantage on other users.  The chances of you seeing more and doing more with the program are greater.  They are leveling out the odds for other users.  Also many retailers don't like double discounts ... because you are already scoring a deal with movie pass, they aren't going to let you get another deal through them.  The whole point of their program is for them to be the preferred.  

You can still use the program, just don't use movie pass.

"LoveLive","t5_31qlw","~~Tokyo 2020 was being predicted by Akira so this here is actually the wrong subreddit~~

First of all, let's combine two traditions: Beethoven's 9th the Olympic opening anthem so to speak, yet sung by [10,000 Japanese](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X6s6YKlTpfw)

The first lyrics...

*""Oh my friends, don't do such ugly notes! Let's do some more pleasent and happier (shinier XD) ones!""*

This could be a speach from Honk or Chika (with Umi or You being cringed to exhaustion) LOL

But srsly, [just open the description here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ITzeRSJQtB4) - I didn't know it's such an important event in Japan, and that those are non-professionals. That's how it's done I suppose!

Then I would [invite some foreigners](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfd_4LHzNHY) 

Maybe a marching band for Astro Boy too. For Attack on Titan we'd need a philharmonic rock lineup, since a philharmonic orchestra plus choir's already there. Also Moon Pride would have to become such a big ""tutti"".

The 10,000s choir would have to do some a capella versions, for instance Hikari Furu/Sagitta Luminis from Madoka Magica, or let's say Eight Melodies from Mother/Earthbound. *""Take a melody, simple as can be, give it some words and sweet harmony: Raise your voices, all day long now, love grows strong now, sing a melody of love, oh love!""* Self-explanatory. 

The orchestra would get the opportunity to shine by performing Destiny/Sadame from X1999 and Ghibli tunes. And of course the LLSS fanfare plus Sailing to the Sunshine.

Of course: There would have to be an original Muse and Aq's staging. Maki and Honk doing Aishiteru Banzai together at last, perhaps even involving the auditory like in the graduation ceremony. 

EliNozo could do And I'm Home and Eternal Eternity (I know the lyrics contain Haruka and Michiru but whatever) XD

Mari would get a full English song at last: Komm susser Tod, and I'd say only her plus piano.

And I want Yohane to sing Bokutachi wa Tenshi Datta, and I don't mean it as a mockery!

Omg what are the lyrics from that Queen song? ""I want it all and I want it now"" XD

But I'm really looking forward to the next summer olympics this time!

There are certainly arguments one could make for or against his addition to the Hall. His lack of playoff experience will likely come into play. But, as for his number being retired in Seattle I would say its a high probability. For one, Griffey was retired after a very lengthy stint in Cincinnati. Though, he certainly didn't achieve the fame there that he did in Seattle. Felix, however, has thus far been a career Seattle player and continues to prove he's invested in the teams success more than his own. In fact, I think that's what is keeping him from bouncing back from injuries. He's carrying the weight of an organization on his shoulders. It's just who he is. Secondly, he is the Mariners most successful pitcher of all-time. That's a difficult thing to ignore. On a personal note, I'd also like to see this number retired simply because its used by everyone and their Mother. Its especially prominent among pitchers for what I assume started as a homage to Nolan Ryan. But, I could be totally wrong. There's certainly more to it - just as shortstops are known to wear number 2 for Jeter.",1519862793

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt; then logically the force exerted should save you if the distance from the jump to where you land is not enough to kill you by itself.

Except you aren't *really* jumping per se. You are pushing yourself away from the wing of the aircraft but with respect to the ground you are still falling down, just somewhat slower than before.

Imagine for example you can jump upward at 5 mph. From a rest this is of course enough to make you leave the ground, but if you are falling at 100 mph then jumping upward at 5 mph from some falling object will still leave you falling at 95 mph. Still going to hurt when you hit.

So I get two PTL ships with a Boost/free Evade combo and plenty of green maneuvers (Asajj has 7, IG-88C has 9).  Asajj has that great dial plus mobile arc and IG-88C has Advanced Sensors -- so there's lots of maneuverability.

Was Son's run-up illegal?  From a strict reading of the laws of the game as they are currently written -- no it was not illegal.  However, from interpretations that have come down from IFAB/FIFA to the US Soccer Federation to me as a referee in the US, we've been instructed that this is an illegal feint since his proximity to the ball is enough to be considered to have completed his run-up.  I assume the English referees have received this same interpretation from FIFA.  Either way, this part of Law 14 needs to be expanded and cleared up.

While the question of the feint is not black and white, the restart is very clear.

Once the referee determines that Son illegally feinted, he is cautioned and the restart is an indirect free kick to Rochdale.  It does not matter what the outcome of the PK is or if there was previous encroachment.  It's always a yellow and a free kick.",1519862794

If this is the top effort you decided you'll invest you are not ready for an idea. Nor are you worth one. 

I'll give you something to ponder: Become an advocate and supporter of the maker movement. Weave that concept into your marketing message. Start segmenting your non existent customer database to support this. 

With something to say, social media begins to have some potential. As does content marketing. (No. Don't ask. They're search terms anyone could find out about. Don't worry about punching the square things on the long flat thing to find out about anything.)

If the paint is off then that's fine. If it's on and not flaking then that's fine, too. (Though many would opt to cover it with non-lead paint for safety.) It's really just flaking/chipping lead paint or the actual act of removing it that poses a danger.

Lead really isn't great. There's no ""safe"" level of lead in the blood and the danger is worse the younger you are. So I'd take it seriously.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","Ugh people are the worst. I got a lot of these comments when I was pregnant, nothing that bad (I cringed when I read that, I'm so sorry), but all about how big I was. I've got a slight frame, was pretty thin when I got pregnant, and had a big baby. So yeah, my belly was big, because it had no where else to go! Those comments made me so mad, I used to laugh them off awkwardly, but as I got bigger, and more irritable, I just got bitchy. Combine those comments and the OMG CHRISTMAS BABY comments (due date was Dec 20th) I was so angry all the time. So I stopped putting people at ease when they'd make those comments. I would just walk away if they were especially rude. When I got the ""are you sure it's not twins"" joke I answered ""no"" completely deadpan (he then tried to explain that it was a joke ugh!) 

The Christmas baby comments actually irritated me more. In my last month of pregnancy, STRANGERS would stop me and say the stupidest things. ""Ohhh she's going to HATE her birthday"" ""Oh no not a Christmas birthday"" ect ect. I guess when you're pregnant, even a decent resting bitch face doesn't stop people. We struggled to get pregnant, and were about to do IVF when we got pregnant. You bet that anyone struggling to get pregnant is NOT going to take the month off ""just in case"" or be upset about a Christmas baby. 

Sorry, I went on a bit of a rant there. People are the worst! However my big Christmas baby is the best, wouldn't have changed a thing!",1519862797

I think a big part of the ""current gen look"" is parallax occlusion mapping - and IMHO Bloodborne (which uses it) set the standard for current gen visuals.

No parallax occlusion in FFXV. Why? Probably because of the temporal AA - TAA is in general incompatible with parallax occlusion mapping due to how they work.

Some games disguise their lack of parallax occlusion mapping well via their artwork - e.g. Doom (which also uses TAA) and Uncharted/HZD (both have a somewhat, highly detail but nonetheless, stylized look to them).

It appears that some crusty engineer changed the factory speakon connectors to XLR, which were often used as speaker connectors in the days of yore, when people had to be fluent in electricity to setup even a basic system. Basic rule of thumb, when working with older systems, and even new systems, connector type doesn't mean a thing with regards to what sort of signal may be present. In this case speaker level signal from a power amplifier  is being carried over XLR connectors which normally would carry low level mic or line signal. 

My advice- change the jacks back to speakon, or wire up some 6.5mm TS (to work with your amp) to xlr cables with suitable 14/2 or 16/2 cable (dont use mic cable), and have fun. Should be easy to determine the XLR pinout by removing the jacks or testing with a battery. ",1519862805

Its simple and you are oblivious to basic laws of economic exchange if you refuse to see it (or you are pulling wool over on someone).  Do you really thi k america (and canada) is nothing but harmless sheep and not wolves?  Wolves are successful because they hunt and exploit the helpless.   Its not pig pen.  Its dragons den

Me being awesome took an investment from someone.  Not a poverty trap like the job i had to take in 2001 for a couple of years.  Im lucky i had a network and education and therefore another investor who didnt have exploit me so much to create value (a successful business growing naturally)

Btw a business owner is not entitled to growth or profit.  You must create value somewhere and far too many business plans this value now comes from the devalued worker. 

This is artificial growth which has to steal value to post it ( notice i didnt say create?).  We all talk about as if its a foregone conclusion, and then you come here and deny that workers are exploited when they are forced to work precarious jobs to not even make ends meet?

Next you will tell me payday loans are a public service.  Anyway as a successful guy who made his own way with good employers and knows the difference i hope i added some extra insight to your other perspectives,

&gt;it presents it as kind of a complicated metaphysical model

The Lanka is not a metaphysical model. It's an unbelievably practical model. Huangbo doesn't take as much time explicating it - he just *employs it*. His audience is already familiar with the material (Zen masters had been lecturing on the eight consciousness model, for one example, for centuries at this point), he doesn't have to take the time to explain it.

At one point Chris Tucker was one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood (per movie) simply because he didn't want to do another Rush Hour movie until they threw enough cash at him.

While I'm not saying the Rush Hour movies are a flop by any means, the amount he was paid for the film has nothing to do with how successful the film was, which is essentially what the ""highest grossing"" thing is trying to measure - how commercially successful it was.

I agree that Stan shouldn't be counted as one of the ""highest grossing actors"", but it's got nothing to do with his paycheck, it's got to do with the fact that he doesn't really have any starring/supporting roles, they're all cameos, and usually when I see a ""highest grossing actors"" list, it excludes cameo/extra work, and only counts major roles.",1519862807

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

They also had a genealogy hobbyist in their family, so they compared notes on Harold.  Same birth city, same birth year, pretty obviously the same guy.  My great-grandfather Harold was in deep shit with his wife and kids for having another secret family.

He has no idea what they're talking about, but he got yelled at A LOT.  After more investigation, it turns out that Harold was actually first cousins with a completely different Harold.  Their fathers were estranged brothers, but get this: they were estranged because they both liked the name Harold, and were furious with each other for refusing to pick a different one for their sons.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","'Oh, Varric, what in the Stone did you *do* last night?' the dwarf asked himself as he nursed his headache. He looked around the hotel room in surprise. Well, at least his manager is going to be happy that he didn't break anything...

To his surprise a hand slithered over his chest, teasing through his chest hair. He looked over in surprise and saw Dana, the human supermodel-turned-actress that was one of the stars of ""Easy Lover"", the film adaptation of one of his books. 

He really didn't like the whole ""Hollywood"" treatment of his works but hey, a free cinema ticket and a party invite? And Dana was actually knowledgeable of his works to outright compare the film she was in to the book. Add in a few bottles of Elvish champagne during the red carpet walk and some strong orcish mead after and...

'I never thought dwarves would be so...' she said as she put the hand a bit lower. 'Well, you *did* mention that you didn't like the stereotypes of always having beards and carrying hammers, but then you have the largest of them all?'

'Yeah, I get that a lot,' Varric said with mild acceptance. Then it became embarrassment when he admitted, 'Look, Da, but I...'

She merely started to laugh out loud before rolling out of the bed. 'Relax, we didn't do anything,' she said as she lifted a dressing gown from the floor. 'I want you to be sober enough to remember. Do you remember that date offer?'

'Saturday...' he tried to recall, 'Dorsia at eight?'

She merely smiled before she walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind her. Varric played it cool, admiring the view as she walked inside...

And immediately cursed himself under his breath. 'Fuck...' he grumbled before he reached for his phone.

With great hesitation he opened Twitter, hoping that maybe, just *maybe* he didn't make a complete cunt out of himself.

*Easy Rider stars hit the red carpet, but book's author steals the show.*

*Easy Rider's author and star ditch after-party to watch baseball in downtown L.A. after studio executives make insulting comments about caste-less dwarves*

*""Easy Rider"" Author Varric Tethras Plays Cards Against The Common People With Supermodel Dana Armando and Bachelor Party*

""A good night"", he thought to himself... then the phone started ringing. 'Aw, shit... Hey, Moira.'

'Really?' she yelled. 'You ditched one of the biggest events in the movie business and went bar-hopping?'

'The bastard told me to come back once I had my inks and called me caste-less,' Varric said in annoyance. 'Do you have any idea how insensitive that was? Moira, be honest with me; how much do you know about the Thaigs or dwarvish society?'

'Not that much,' she admitted. 'So... how bad was it?'

'He basically said, and I know you'll be offended but not nearly as badly as I was,' Varric warned, 'the equivalent of, ""When are you going to pick me some cotton, you n&amp;!^er?""'

'It's *that* bad?!' Moira asked.

'Yeah, it is,' he said. 'I was *not* tolerating that.'

He climbed out of the bed, not really caring that he was entirely nude as he walked around the room. 'Well, now I see why most dwarves on Reddit are calling for a boycott of the movie...'

'They caught it?' Varric asked.

'He said it on *national TV*,' Moira scolded him. 'How pissed were you?!'

'Well, if I was sober I'd have kicked his ass right then and there,' Varric said. 'Fuck, I'm gonna go get some coffee before I finish ""All This Shit is Weird"".'

'...You forgot?' Moira asked him. 'You've got an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight!'

'I *did* remember,' Varric answered. 'I've been waiting for this interview for weeks!'

'And the interview with that British TV show?' Moira asked.

'...crap,' he cursed. 'Where and when?'

'Queen's suite, half an hour,' Moira answered. 'I'll bring an extra-strong latte.'

She hung up as he started gathering his things and then knocked on the door. 'Dana?' he asked through the door. 'I'm sorry for leaving you like this, but I forgot I've got an interview so I need to go back to my room and prepare.'

'It's fine,' she called back from within the shower. 'Just remember our date!'

'I will,' he said while hopping his legs through his pants and then running out of the room and down the hall.",1519862807

Kawhi in tier 2, he is definitely on the same level as Harden and Davis. One of the GOAT defenders in history with efficient 20+ PPG offense.

Move Kyrie down to tier 4, as a Celtics fan, he’s not necessarily on that level of Russ.

* What does the character want, and why can’t they have it?
* What is the character afraid of and why are they afraid of it?
* What made the character who they are today?
* Why the f*** should we care?

 I dont run or lift at all. Basically only do push ups and situps. Working to 50. Currently at 20 each but I do them in sets of 10 and give myself about 2 mins in between each set. Other than that I walk alot but thats about it.


EDIT: figured some people may benefit from this info so here ya go.


Food/drink: i stay clear from fried food as best I can and wont eat a main dish that was fried. As the fats and oils tend to make my heart work harder and makes it difficult to breath. I also stay away from sugar and caffeine to avoid raising my heart rate. I only drink tea and water unless its the weekend then whiskey!  I eat alot of salads/chicken/turkey/fruit/a form of grain like rice


Workout: I dont run, I walk roughly a mile a day depending on weather and do push ups and situps in the mornings. Again have to make sure heart isnt going fast so I take breaks.


Episodes: ive been to the ER about 6 times because of this. When my heart goes off rhythm I can feel it. Its like it skips a beat every beat. If I did have an episode I would find out right when I got up from sitting or laying. Trick in these episodes is to remain calm and breath. Controlled Breathing is insanely important. Other than that I chew 2 asprin and call 911. DO NOT WALK if I walk around for more than 3 or 4 steps while having an episode I run the risk of passing out. Last episode I had I tried to make it to the entrance of the building and collapsed. So remaining calm and sitting while breathing is the best thing to do. Also dialing 911 or getting a ride.


After my last episode I got a home blood pressure monitor that can also detect abnormal heartbeats for about 80 dollars. I recommend this to everyone. Not only can it help tell if you need to go to the hospital or if you just need to rest. But can let you know if you go into hyper tension as well (fried food and sugar cause me to have hyper tension)",1519862809

Genetics must be *fascinating* when observed from an occult perspective, not that it isn't normally. I know your PhD focus is likely in a super specific area unrelated to this, but in reading your post I had a sudden wonder if differences in natural ""aptitude"" for the occult could be explained in part by epigenetics.

e.g. while Joe is sure ghosts are hogwash, Nancy has been seeing spirits as long as she can remember, and the difference is that Nancy inherited some gene in an active expression, while Joe's gene is dormant. Joe could change his gene into an active expression, but will have to work a lot harder than Nancy. 

BUT I'm no geneticist, that's just a wacky idea I had. I've got one semester left before I graduate with my BS in Metallurgical engineering. My big kick is looking at parallels between the super-macro to the super-micro. The stars circling the galaxy, the planets circling the stars, the moon's circling the planets, all the way down to the electrons whizzing about a nucleus and further. It's all fractals and repeating cycles. 

I've got this ridiculous but awesome idea that if you had a microscope that could zoom in, to infinite magnification, that after you zoomed in through the atomic and quantum you'd eventually find yourself looking at the galaxy, then in further to the system, and in etc, until you finally found yourself looking at yourself from above, staring into the microscope.

I set new PRs in terms of max weekly miles (60) and max monthly miles (207).  I suffered some injuries (blisters, scrapes from falling, badly scraped elbow from bike crash), but those are all healed and didn't stop me from running.

You're assuming that your ban would a.) be possible to effectively enforce and b.) given a, be efficacious. That is a hell of an assumption, especially considering that we've tried similar things before and they failed.

I stated all of that as an opinion, not necessarily an assumption of fact. You didn't even offer a counter-argument, just implied that I'm wrong based off an ambiguous claim that ""we've tried similar things before and they failed."" Care to elaborate?

&gt;Except for the right to buy a semi-auto rifle if you fall outside of whatever your definition of ""stricter control"" is. You're definitely losing that.

Correct, even though the second amendment doesn't define owning a semi-auto rifle as a right..

&gt;There we have it. ""You're not losing anything, just give up your semi rifles, and then we'll talk about what else you'll need to give up. But you're not losing anything!""

&gt;Just say what you mean. You want to ban firearms because you're afraid we've got too much liberty and could do with more security instead.

Sean Hannity!? Is that you!? lol, what a beautiful strawman. At least you tried. 

I never gave such a blanket statement about banning firearms. I don't *want*to ban them as a whole and I don't even necessarily *want* to ban AR15s. They simply are a very present danger that *is* avoidable, and it might in fact be the only reasonable option... Perhaps not an outright ban, but by some means, the danger they present is avoidable. Since the amount of times people have used them to actually stop a school shooter/mass shooting, is **astronomically low**, compared to the inverse of that situation, I'd say there's no reasonable argument against restricting them.

I mean, look at what the Shia Muslims of Iran do with their self flaggelation at their holiest sites every year. It looks verrrry unusual, but at least they do it openly and everyone knows what's going on and it has a structure and public canon etc., so it's a proper religion at least.

You say you don't want negative comments, but instead of clearly wrighting out your personal qualms with the series, you vaguely list them out with little explenation, effectively painting a big target on your back for XY anime fans to lob hate at you. Like, it's so blatent, I'm half convinced this is just a troll attempt. Well, if it is, I'll take the bait and tell rebut some of your complaints.

- How you feel about the battles is rather subjective, although personally I think they're some of the most dynamic battles the series had with its use of 3D camera. It's definitely fresh looking after BW which was like 80% stock footage of attacks on motion line backgrounds.

- Another subjective thing. Nothing i can say really, you're allowed to dislike characters.

- Complex? I'm not sure what could have confused you. Perhaps if you had explained it more than not at all, I'd be able to understand.

- Team Flare was teased serveral times since the beginning of XYZ, with even a couple episodes relating to them. Sure the attack on Lumiose was rather poorly paced, but you can't say Team Flare was tacked on at the end.

- Yea and Ash released/sent off nearly his entire original team by the time Johto ended. What's your point? He releases his pokemon all the time.

- Too Flying Types is a weird critisim. I mean, you're right, but its not like it ever became an actual problem in the show. Team composition is not really an issue that the show addresses, just a problem that fans that know how basic teambuilding works have. I can't seem to get how this is a problem of the show's quality. You don't see people saying Yugioh is bad because Yugi used a shit card like Kuriboh.

- Gym Battles were hit and miss, I'll give you that. Although I'm a bit curious. Everyone I talk to always say Valerie's battle was the absolute worst of XY, and I can kinda understand why. It was short, Trick Room was used poorly and made no sense how X-Scissor could just break it somehow. Also Valerie's PokeSpeak was kinda cringy.

- Again. Subjective. Maybe the voraciousness of shippers fueled her ""overrated-ness"".

- Some reasons? Mind telling us those reasons? No? Well, I'll do it. XY's movies were mostly pretty bad. Diancie's movie played up a big battle between Xerneas and Yveltal in the trailers, but nothing happened. Hoopa's movie was a big Legendary circlejerk with Hoopa going around being really annoying. Volcanion's was decent, but put next to the other movies, it doesn't save XY from having some of the worst movies in the series.

So there. If this is some kind of trick, you got me. But please in the future, if you wanna voice your opinions, state them clearly explain yourself. If you don't, you end up making you potentially enlightening opinion sound like the rambling of a whiny child.",1519862817

Haven't played DotA for months, due to moving, and not liking the meta the game had about 8 months ago. Started playing it again after a frustrating League game, and aside from being rusty the whole game just feels better. Better balance, Better game flow, Better choices..

&gt;	After re-abilitation, the ability system took quite a while to regain all of its previous functionality and to start gaining new features. During this period, a lot of work also went into the syntax of ability definitions. As the syntax improved, ability components that were implemented early on were structured quite differently from those that were implemented later. While expedient for internal testing, this inconsistency in syntax was difficult to work with, and had a tendency to introduce bugs when making changes, so recently we’ve gone through all the ability components for all the classes and updated them to the latest syntax. We’ve also taken a lot of the common concepts utilized by multiple ability components and moved them into shared path references. This means there is less duplicated data within skills, leaving far fewer places errors can occur, and ensuring that the ones that do have errors should be far easier to track down.",1519862818

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I didn't make it to ten since I didn't see enough movies I loved; there were plenty I missed out on that I wanted to see (mostly smaller films like The Shape of Water, Colossal, Lady Bird). But here's my top 5:

1. A Silent Voice - Didn't tear up, but man I felt a lot of emotional pain when watching this one. The animation is beautiful, I absolutely loved (most of) the cast, and it just felt pretty real when it came to Ishida trying to redeem himself. I do hear that the manga is better (and from reading a few volumes here and there, it is), but I think the director and Kyoto Animation did a good job at condensing most of the story into a movie runtime.

2. Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie - As a former fan of the books, I loved this film a lot; what a wonderful surprise from DreamWorks. This adaptation has the quick and clever humor that's expected from Nicholas Stoller's writing, and the animation is cute and really brings Dav Pilkey's art to life; even having fun segments in 2D animation and sock puppets (yeah, you read that correctly). And unlike most animated family comedies I've seen, this one feels very sincere; even with all the crude jokes, it's feels as natural and creative as the rest of the film's dialogue-based and visual humor. If you're looking for something silly and fun or your kids, I definitely recommend this over The Boss Baby or Despicable Me 3.

3. Blade Runner 2049 - Easily the best and my favorite live-action film of last year. While I have committed the sin of not watching Ridley Scott's original film, I still really admired 2049's efforts. Officer K's journey to discovering his humanity was compelling, the acting was superb (for example, Ana Armas was an absolute ""joy"" and Syliva Hoeks legit terrified me) and the visuals (especially the cinematography and practical effects) and sound we're outstanding. Some complained about the slow pace and long runtime; while I can see where they're coming from and can agree to a small degree, I still was able to enjoy the film regardless and felt that the slower pace gave it a more immersive atmosphere. It just has so much personality that most big budget films lack today.

4. Coco - Another grand effort from Pixar.  Both the Land of the Living and the Land of the Dead were designed with a lot of color and charm, the film supposedly did a great job at representing Mexican culture (especially with the Day of the Dead and the theme of family), the characters were charming, and the story took a number of directions that I didn't expect (though there were still some cliches here and there). The songs were great, my favorite was Un Poco Loco, though Remember Me was still very good and I loved the changes of its context as the story went along.

5. Power Rangers - Probably the least ""good"" film on my list, but I came out loving this when I saw it on opening weekend, and I still enjoy it. On paper, the story and arguably the screenplay are generic; but the execution came out pretty decently. The best thing about it is the cast: the rangers' personalities and acting bounce off each other nicely (especially in the case of Billy; I wanna see RJ Cyler in more big-budget roles), I thought Bryan Cranston and Bill Hader were solid choices for Zordon and Alpha-5, and Elizabeth Banks was having a ball as Rita Repulsa. I also appreciated the amount of time placed into developing the friendship and trust between the teens before getting into the Ranger aspect of the film; I do agree that it does take too long, and the third act, while entertaining, feels a bit underwhelming for a film about the freaking Power Rangers. But at the same time, it still managed to make the rangers feel like actual people and had them earn their chance to save the world. Compared to other tent pole blockbusters and non-Marvel/DC superhero films, Power Rangers just felt more sincere to me, and I believe the director and writers wanted to revive the franchise for a new generation, while respecting its origins. I will admit, though, the execution is also very clumsy in its script (awkward tonal shifts from surprisingly dark to silly, the pacing issue mentioned earlier, and topics that seem out of place for  something cheesy as PR) and other production values (the CG and designs ranged from decent to awful at points). But I still thought it was a decent superhero origin story, and a decent reboot to a really silly franchise. Makes me kind of sad that it flopped so hard, we'll probably never get any of the planned sequels...

And here's the other ones I liked, though not as much as my top 5:

Logan - Dark and nearly depressing, but still thrilling and thematic; Logan isn't a film I'd watch on a Sunday afternoon, but is still a compelling journey for a weary and pushed-to-the-edge Wolverine.

LEGO Batman - A fast-paced, hilarious spin-off to The LEGO Movie that explores Batman's insecurities in a mostly entertaining and heartfelt way. The third act did drag a lot for me, but I still enjoyed this one.

The Disaster Artist - James Franco was awesome as Tommy Wiseau, and this was a funny exploration into the making of a so-bad-it's-good classic. I might read the book sometime. 

Baby Driver - Slick, funny, and energetic; Edgar Wright hits a home run with this music-centric heist flick. Though the romance could've been developed a bit better, imo.

Dunkirk - This film is a technical marvel, and works wonderfully as a gateway into the events at Dunkirk; seeing this in 70MM IMAX helped create even more tension and anticipation. But I probably wouldn't watch it again unless I got a 4K TV and Dolby Atmos sound system, because the lack of identifiable characters kinda put me off a little. I think Dunkirk is a thrilling film, but not a favorite for me.",1519862822

 with k,l∈ℤ, and it only gets uglier. To ask about convergence is a difficult matter, since we're not dealing with a sequence of complex numbers, but rather a sequence of sets of numbers.
If choose exactly one value for the exponentiation though, that is for example you define i^(z):=e^(-i𝜋z/2), then you get a sequence, which is probably what you're asking for. I don't know if that sequence converges, but if it does, its limit should be 2i/𝜋*W(-i𝜋/2) where W is Lambert's W-function.

My bet: Near the end of this year, if not sooner, the UK will officially revoke its Article 50 move and declare its intent to remain within the EU or move from fully EU status to EEA status.

This whole thing was an untenable trainwreck from the beginning and no one in the British government has had the political will to be honest and upfront about it.

Let’s take a wacky extreme example: Imagine they eventually invented a gun with magic heat seeking bullets that could hunt a person with a specific DNA coding (or something similar)... the point is technology gets to the point where we have a gun that can target who it wants to kill.  Can you see how this tool is a lot more effective at committing crimes than a knife?

Obviously a gun makes it more easier to kill something, that’s pretty much the reason a person owns one.  So where do we draw the line as to what a person should be able to purchase?",1519862824

I'll be honest, I think many people look at tuba's negatively.  It's never been a ""cool"" instrument per se.  The only music that I listen to that even semi-regularly has a tuba is jazz and the jazz that I prefer, usually doesn't have tuba.

As far as jobs, I have no idea.  There's obviously work in big bands and orchestras but less so for mainstream music.  I know The Roots have (or had) a tuba player but tubas usually compete with the bass frequences that most people prefer to save for kicks/basses/synths.

That said.....who cares?  If you love tuba, become a great tuba player and perhaps you'll be the person that opens it up to a wider audience like countless other musicians have done for other underutilized instruments.",1519862825

*Leo Kruger is now Adam Rose. He had a party backstage. A lot of the developmental guys and girls who haven't debuted were in the segment.

*Antonio Cesaro beat Justin Gabriel.

*Adam Rose beat Wesley Blake. Rose's entrance is everyone having a party on the stage.

It is if you learn from it.

So, yeah, I’m looking at that websites and I don’t know where to start. I don’t think a wiki is the ideal format.

You’re making a game, right? Try a Google Doc.
You clearly have a lot of ideas, but you’re presenting them like it’s a movie trailer, trying to hook us with intriguing tidbits, but it’s also five trailers and there are more intriguing tidbits than concrete things to grab onto. It’s overwhelming.

RPG manuals are technical guides. Ditch the intrigue. Start with a quick overview of the mechanics. Are there dice? Do I need a full set of different dX or just a bunch of d6s? Is there a GM? Is it collaborative?

That’s a whole section/chapter right there. Next section, tell us what kind of adventures this is designed to set us on. Don’t give us hooks. Don’t lure us in with mystery. Tell us one party’s ultimate goal and one thing they’re doing to achieve that. One paragraph that makes sense to someone unfamiliar with the game. Then, do that two more times.

Now, start telling us the setting. Start from the beginning. No mysteries. The GM needs to know everything you know so that they can build their game. If you don’t know why it’s been 2005 for years, take it out of the game. If you do, say so right away.

In PUBG if you find a house that has windows a bit too high to shoot from, many more houses that uses that exact same design are going to have the same problem. Plus you can lean in PUBG, which has some interesting effects on where your bullet originates. There's a few spots around boxes on Militia that you can look to be perfectly over the box by a pixel or two, but have a bullet decal applied in the air above the box because the box's hitbox is just 2-3 pixels higher than what you can actually see.

It could be better, for sure. It's on Unreal and there are plenty of Unreal games with almost pixel perfect hitboxes that give you a sense more like CS than what you're feeling in PUBG right now. :)",1519862829

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","But those subreddits aren't demanding you read anything. Advertising yourself as a space for like-minded people isn't an invitation for contrarians to engage, I think it's wrong to conflate the two. The sidebars usually states the purpose of the subreddit and rules for participation. You have the choice to cause conflict, to find a more appropriate forum, or to simply read and digest the content of that subreddit and come to your own opinion. 

It's a far more transgressive action to start a debate no one asked for than to make a post into the ether of a chat forum that comports to the forum's rules of conduct. Politics or not, free speech is not about allowing and condoning inconsiderate or uncivil behavior. Our rights come with responsibilities and I think some sense of civility is inherent to that. To break civility, especially when it's laid out clearly what civil behavior constitutes in a particular setting, is a purposefully aggressive action which is why I characterized it as rude. Mischaracterizing a subreddit as demanding attention and ""rude"" in turn seems a facile reduction of that point. 

Exchange of ideas is not limited to debate or conflict-based discussions. That you demand all people engage in that form of interaction at all times seems unrelentingly narrow. I'm not saying all forums need to be ""safe spaces"" but those that identify as such are owed some understanding before you start creating emotional harm.  ",1519862831

"GuitarAmps","t5_2u7ul","Sounds like the engineer at the time did the simplest and quickest grounding scheme possible to get the amp to work. Having multiple grounds like that, with high current heaters grounded with low current audio signals all over the amp chassis, can lead to induced hum through ground loops. Pin 1 on the octal sockets for 6V6 tubes is sometimes earthed to act as an internal shield because it isn't used for a tube connection. Now that I've seen the schematic, I wouldn't use the secondary CT connection even if the amp hums because one of the heater taps is grounded. Doing so would lead to the scenario I mentioned above, shorting half the turns of the secondary. I'm afraid any hum in this amp would take a fair bit of rearranging grounds to fix. But you know what - lots of great amps used this ""bad grounding"" arrangement without ill effect, and you might just be fine!",1519862832
"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","Couple of questions - are these your very first poly experiences? And did you struggle with any of these feelings (not being cool enough/good enough) while dating monogamously? (assuming you've had some monogamous relationships)

Also, have you previously had emotionally intimate relationships?

I'll be more helpful if I know the answer to some of these questions, but at this point, I think it's worth questioning if polyamory is for you or not. Maybe it is, and this is just a tough adjustment period. But maybe it's not, and this is your heart and soul telling you that you are really just not OK with this. Or hell, maybe someday polyamory will be for you, but right now it's not. 

If that's true, it's totally OK. Have you given yourself permission to explore mentally the idea that you're not polyamorous, or how you'd feel in a relationship where you weren't worried about metamours?

I know you can 'charge and use at the same time' but the reality is that you are consuming more power than the charger can provide so it is just draining at a slower rate.

I know some brands prefer to distribute themselves, and some have agreements with other vendors, so I'm aware some of my preferences may not be possible, but I'll do my best.


Buying filaments in Canada is fairly difficult. Mostly due to shipping. The main sources are Amazon, filaments.ca and spool3d.


Amazon offers a bunch of no-name filaments that are no good. However they do offer 'AMZ3D' and 'Hatchbox'. Both are great filaments. I prefer hatchbox as it's a better product in my view. Sadly I think they only distribute on Amazon. And even on Amazon some are never stocked. 


Filaments.ca and spool3d offer free shipping on orders over around $125. (don't remember exactly). Which is prohibitive for people just wanting a few spools, or just need one same day. 


I haven't used spool3d's filament, but I hear good things. Might be an idea. 


Shipping from the states is an option, but usually not worth it after exchange and Brokerage. 



One company FilamentOne, mostly ships from the states, but I believe is working on Canadian distribution. They make an amazing product. Not budget filament for sure. But quality. If you could make an agreement with them, you'd have at least one loyal customer, lol. 



Obviously you need a budget filament as a lot of people just want cheap solutions. ESun/inland (same thing, different name) is a budget yet reliable filament that people tend to buy up a bunch of if it's a good deal. 



Again, a good deal for filament is usually decided by shipping costs. So even if you have to price above the online competitors, you'd still be cheaper due to lack of shipping costs. Long live brick and mortar. 



A few U.S. specialty filaments that would be amazing but I don't think are viable would be 'proto-pasta', and 'matterhackers'. 



In summary here's a list in two catagories. Budget and premium. Top of each list will be most preferred down to least. Sorry for the rant. 


Budget:

Hatchbox


Inland / eSun


MatterHackers maker series. 


Amz3d



Premium:

FilamentOne 


Proto-pasta

To self medicate to become productive / constructive member of society. Basically theirs a function behind our use that unfortunately sometimes becomes dsydunctional after time. Personally I think for most it’s necessary for people to walk their own path and learn their own lessons. 

A good middle ground is acknowledging that sometimes using something functionally, say etizolam at 1-3 mgs a day for 4-6 weeks may be a necessary step to ultimately being able to function and if necessary have something like etiz on deck as a PRN which is medical jargon for something taken as needed as determined by the patient. Than hopefully you get into a place where your well enough to seek any sort of assisted or individual therapy or treatment that actually heals the root issues as apposed to medications which are more treatments than cures 

Personally I would avoid Kratom as that can lead to a very understated opiate addiction, just check out r/quittingkratom and check some posts there. Check out r/tianeptine to read about people who have dug themselves

Scholarship

School Visit

Coach Visit 

Hey Rudy! Head coach of the Oregon Ducks here. We here at Oregon love your desire to stay close to home on the west coast. We fully understand the choice to stay close to your loved ones, and with Oregon being just above Cali, they can come to most of your games as well. As well as all the home games, we play games in Cali, Washington, and other nearby states that you family and friends can come watch. With the distance being close, the culture of towns here are more similar than if you went east. We have many of the same things you have in Cali, the transition period wont even feel like one. Since Eugene is much bigger than Ridgecrest, you will have more to explore and do, something we will talk about more later on. With the great Cali talent im sure you want to team up with someone you know, and we have Richard Evans. A 5 star last year who has one of many players we scouted in Cali. Someone who you have played with before, it will be a fun time. Im sure you want to know what our past and current situation is with the amount of Cali players on our team. In my 12 years at Oregon I have had a total of 12 CA players, for a coach in a different state ill say that is pretty darn good. We lost two Cali players last year but still return one while we hope to get you and another CA recruit at least. We have built a major pipeline without even trying to, Oregon is a great spot that many CA recruits flock to right away. To name a few from just Cali along and not any other close states, Billy Preston, Makur Maker, Aidan Mahaney, and James Washington. All world class players who are all now in the NBL. It will feel like home in Eugene, something you cant get by going across the country. everything you want and more in a great program!

Important to you is how you can go pro with Oregon. So seeing how Oregon is currently tied for 5th on the amount of pros by school, we can no doubt get any type of player ready to go. That could be year 1 like James Washington or Mitchell Robinson, or year 2 like Shawn Melvin and Michael Jones among others. Either way you are guaranteed to get drafted, and a high likely-hood of going high. Lets talk about our recent success first, last year we had 4 guys drafted and a high rated senior just miss out as well. That makes it the 2nd time in the last 4 years we have had 4 guys drafted at once. Ever since 2017 we have had someone get drafted, and in 2016 we had an undrafted player who went on to put up 10/5 for his career, about as close as you can get to a drafted player. We have had some true forwards come through here such as Dillon Brooks, Durral Brooks, and Victor Marin. Durral and Victor are both young but Dillon is a career 11 PPG scorer in the NBL. Our plan for you is to get you ready to be a one and done, and with our supporting cast of PGs and FCs that well bring in, you will be set for a great year. With over 20 guys drafted, 15 1st rounders and 6 lottery, we are the school to get you to the pros.

Winning is huge for you. You cant go to a team that isn't a consistent winner or only has some bigs wins as of late. Looking at our team for next year as thats of course very important, we have a lot of potential. The talent might not be there yet but we have returning starter Terry Pruneda, 6th man last year Lino Delrio who could start, Jamar Lear who will be a senior and played some really good minutes last year among others. That potential being Richard Evans, who has an unlimited amount that can launch him to one of the stars on our team, and Li Xiaoyu who just like Evans has potential to be a star. And then of course we have studs from a great class like you who can come in and be an all american with some hard work. They are ready to reach their potential next year, and with open spots in front of them they'll be deadly. Lets go to our history of winning now. An average 15-15 first year when I got the job. After that year I totally turned the team around for 3 straight elite 8s. We have been flying ever more since. In my 12 years here I have made the PCC finals in half of them, and winning half of those to get 3 PCC title game victories. In the NT we have had some struggles as of late but still have 4 elite 8s and a national title. The title being worth some struggles no doubt. It shows we had the best team in the nation that year, which is no doubt true. We were 28-2 with a PCC title when it was in its hay-day back in our title winning year 2022. We have also been over 24 wins, an elite mark that can be good for a 1 seed with some good wins, 8 of the past 10 seasons. We haven't missed the NT since my first year where I didn't have any of my own recruits. We are the title winning consistent team you need!

Along with the previous things we have talked about, a loyal coach and program is what you want as well. You want to know where I am on the loyalty rankings im sure, at a perfect 100. These days many people have a perfect loyalty score, but I was the 1st to it by a whole year. If loyalty scores were to add up, I would be #1 without any competition. Some other things to show I am the most loyal coach around. These include when picking either players, assistants, whatever it is, they have to be dedicated to the program. I make sure they do their best work each and every day, no matter the person. I have had many opportunities to go to just about any job in the country at some point or another. Never have I gave it any notice. Now lets talk about our fantastic contract situation. I can proudly say I am tied for the longest contract in the entire league. 2043 with no coach options to sneak away like some coaches. Unnecessarily long you might say, but that's the type of coach I am. Fully dedicated to Oregon no matter what. I am one of very few coaches to be with their same school their whole coaching career, and the longest tenured coach of all of them as well. We making promises we keep them. Such as Terry Pruneda wanting to stay close to Iowa a few years back. We gave him the first 2 games of the season in Iowa so his family could attend. You wont find a more loyal coach than here in Eugene!

On another note, prestige of a school is something you would rather have. And at Oregon we are that, currently tied for 6th with a score of 81. Over the elite 80 score for 6 years now, we arent just some school that has come on recently.

Being a new college student in a totally new place to you, you'll want to explore and see what it has to offer. Lucky for you there is a lot to do and see in Eugene. I could talk about our great sports teams and our world class facilities, but ill go more into Eugene and what it has to offer for you. Every Saturday there is Eugene Saturday Market, you can get fresh food, catch some love music, and experience something that has been part of Eugene since the 1970s. Hendricks park is another place im sure you will love. It has 200-year-old Douglas fir trees that look stunning in person. This park leads to the hiking trials that Eugene is also known for. One of the best mountain trails in Oregon is called Spencer Butte, a beautiful view when you make it to the top. The peak overlooks the city and during certain times of the year, such as Autumn, it can be even more fascinating. An annual event that I attend and encourage you to as well is the Lane County Fair. It is one of the most famous fairs in Oregon and is a great event to go to every year. This is just a brief overview of somethings to do in Eugene, we know you will love it here!",1519862839

I don't agree with your math.

If a uber driver makes 30k a year and the hardware/service cost is about 30k a year then it's basically an even trade off to go driverless.


My math-

35k electric car(model 3)
20k add hardware
12k ride share specific mainenance

total- 62k

If it drives 100hrs a week and can generate 20$ per hr(4 rides at 5$ per ride) that is 100k in revenue per year. That is a low estimate considering the minimum fee for a uber is like 6.25.

All you really need is to pay for is tires+insurance+electricity. I don't think that will come close to 40k per year.

*With the distraction, Akira moved further into play. Blue flames licked across his body again, this time transforming his forearms and legs as well as the wings shooting out of him again. He sheathed his swords as he jumped over Orion and the shield guards, using his wings to gain extra height.* 

*Landing on the log, he slid down it, holding out his hands towards each taut rope as he did.

The fact that intensive and semi-intensive aquaculture operations use animal feed does not take away the fact that highly energy-efficient alternatives exist. In fact, there are [carps that feed on grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_carp) which are alreday used as an an effective biocontrol for undesirable aquatic weeds. You certainly don't have to feed them corn. 

&gt;Aquaculture is definitely a niche

Yes it is a niche, but a pretty widespread niche around the world that helps guarantee food security. Let us not forget that poor people are the majority in the world, that good land is not uniformly distributed and that some countries' feeding needs exert great pressure on their limited land resources, so all alternatives have to be considered. 

In fact, there's troves of information about these practices around the world which make a difference for millions upon millions of people:

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I'm in the exact same situation. It really does suck. In the beginning of our relationship we saw each other everyday and even had the same job so we were rarely apart. I miss that and have definitely felt like we are missing out on ""couple stuff"" like making dinner and watching a tv show in the evenings. However, I have started to adjust and I would say there have been positive things that have come out of the situation. 

For one, we have made a weekly date night on Monday nights (his day off) and stick to it. We always make sure we do something nice and that the time is quality since we don't have quantity on our side. This has made Mondays a day I really look forward to! 

Second, I realized how dependent I was on him being around to be happy and I've started to work on that. I've started prioritizing seeing friends again and since he has worked this job, my friendships have strengthened. I was also sick of being alone all the time so I have been more proactive about keeping busy and joined a fitness class, started a free online course, revisited my hobby of music, and so on. I even got a puppy to keep my busy and give me some company and that has helped immensely. He doesn't allow me to feel bored ever!! 

I know that you are worried about his health but also remember that this is probably just temporary. He may not want to quit his job now but if it is impacting his health and social life he will probably come around eventually. My SO told me last week he was thinking of looking for a new job because he is sick of living opposite to the rest of the world, but that has taken 2.5 years for him to feel that way. He usually loves his job.

Lastly, just remember that it is easy to imagine the perfect scenario where you have every evening together and you do all these wonderful things, but it's not really reality for anyone. When you spend everyday together it's just as easy to become distant and do your own thing at night and so the same amount of effort needs to be applied. Overall, every couple has their struggles.

I hope this helps a bit! All the best to you 💙

"travel","t5_2qh41","Don't worry about an electric bike if you're fairly fit. The terrain is flat, and you might miss a little variety in your speed, but for a short daytrip, three gears should be fine.

Bikes can lock on pretty much anything. There will be places in the city centers that are more restrictive towards bike placement, but those will generally have a large bike parking garage somewhere (check out the multi-story one at Amsterdam Centraal while you're there). The villages you visit won't be nearly as strict. 

Be sure you bike on bike paths and walk on sidewalks. It's good practice to park your bike out of the way of pedestrians and other bikers. You can lock your bike to anything attached to the ground or a building; be sure to run the lock through the front wheel, the body of the bike, and something attached to the ground or a building.

You'll need to buy a ticket for your bike and be sure to enter the bike train car (ask the conductor if you need help). And do note the times that bikes can't be transported by train.",1519862843

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt;Imperial fighters being laughably weak is coming from

TIE fighters have no shielding, they are generally always depicted as pretty unmaneuverable, with the larger Millennium Falcon flying circles around them, their armor shown to be extremely weak, to the point of [handheld weapons taking them out](https://i.imgur.com/Fee10Hn.jpg), and their main weapon does little more than [scratch heavy plating](https://i.imgur.com/GX1HsWX.jpg) or [kick up some rocks](https://i.imgur.com/Baf5D2N.jpg). Which makes sense, since they're designed as sort of a cheap swarm fighter, and not meant to engage heavier craft like Longswords or frigates/corvettes. The bombers might prove a bigger threat to both, but they're also shown to be pretty darn slow, unshielded and unmaneuverable. In the end, they would probably inflict heavy casualties on the UNSC, but I just can't imagine a swarm of TIEs doing what took literally hundreds of covenant ships and take down the UNSC fleet. 

&gt;are also armoured with a titanium alloy? 

That may be true but the alloy must be pretty weak, considering how easy it is to break them. The 110mm rotary cannon on the Longsword is effectively a WW2 artillery shell that can be fired in a Gatling gun configuration, and would effortlessly blow apart a TIE fighter to pieces. But that's just the Longsword. The heavier ships are covered in similar weapons that are manned by AIs that would be able to pick apart a swarm of TIEs. ",1519862847

"LARP","t5_2rl8h","Hey first of all, welcome! Most people I know got into Larping around your age bracket and had a blast with the sudden increase in physical activity and creativity outlet Larping provides. 

So my first question : have you done an acting, reenactments, or table top before? Anything where you have had play another character?

Next what kind of game are you looking for? I'm gonna break this down into a few sections.

Setting:
Larping runs a huge array of settings, so find out if your crew has a preference between, historical, fantasy, scfi, post apoc, ect.


Fighting:
Are you looking for something where you can fight with latex and boffers? Or a larp where you only fight with dice, cards or some other none physical way?

Role playing:
Some games are more about the fight than the role play and some are just more relaxed than strict. So find out what your group wants, do they want to really be immerssed in another world, or would they like a game where they can jsut be themselves but swing weapons. Most larps I've been to are really good about being a good balance where players take care to stay in character but will break if scenes get to intense to say ""Hey that was a really good scene no hard feelings you're great"" Or to shake an npcs hand after they've downed them to say ""Good fight"". But every larp is different so its good knowing what you'd like going in.


As for being a mute character, I have done it, even learned sign language, it was REALLY fun. That said, I wouldn't want to do it my first time larping. Being at a larp you can really have fun by putting yourself out there and seeing what comes you way. I think it would be rather hard to come in as a new comer to a community and play a mute. BUT if you still want to I can give you some pointers there as well if you like.

Edit**
Oh general tips:
Bring extra socks, just do it.
Buy bug spray.
Bring extra food, enough for you and your friends and a few others you might wanna feed, nothing brings people together like food.
You're character isn't you and someones character isn't them. While people can be jerks, don't make that call based on their character.
Larping is a Geeky hobby, you will run into really amazing creative people, you will also run into maladjusted people.Be kind and understanding, but don't let people walk over you just because they are established in the community. If something feels off, trust your gut.
Lots of larps don't provide you with much in the way of sleeping, bring sleeping bags blankets the whole nine.

He told story of rich man who went to Hell and Lazarus the beggar outside his estate who went to Heaven and the rich man asked for Lazarus to dip his finger in water and put a drop of water on his tongue due to the heat.  Jesus Christ is the only source of information on Hell, the Old Testament only spoke about Hades or land of the dead.

The demons begged to be cast into a herd of pigs rather than to be cast into Hell.

&gt;Almost need to take a Costanza approach to the whole situation . George Costanza concludes that every instinct he’s had, every decision he's made, has been wrong and that he should henceforth do the opposite of what he had routinely been doing. It kinda makes sense.

That's close to what I did, but I was a little more intentional about it, trying to figure out why my instincts were wrong in the first place...

&gt; I lacked empathy and figured I could survive any storm by standing tall. 

That hits far too close to home for me!!!

&gt;I understand why people have midlife crisis's. 

Just coming out of mine and feeling better than I ever have...  No sports car, but a shiny new attitude toward life, a better idea of how to be a better lover, husband, and father, and a whole lot more understanding about the role I played in my own DB.

&gt;I'm afraid of letting go
&gt;And I guess that you don't know
&gt;That I'm all torn up inside

SO knows...  But they're hurting too...  You just can't see it yet...

Good luck!

I think that point is driven farther home in the epilogue when you finally have the larger scheme of things revealed.

Jade Druid is not a control deck, its midrange and its also rotating to wild with the new rotation which is the same fate as mill rogue so thats irrelevant.

There are no control decks that do nothing but stall anymore, especially since there are decks with infinite resources like Jade and Kingsbane. These control decks actually run threats **and** are actually interactive. You at least get to play your cards instead of it just being a race to dump all your cards and hope the opponent draws poorly like it is against mill decks.

Rin requires a ridiculous amount of setup and by the time you destroy their deck they would have already drawn a ton of it, not to mention the deathrattle can just be silenced away. Gnomeferatu only removes one card and its in a class that can't bounce cards back into their hand.


&gt; You know, I'd almost agree with your argument if warlocks wouldnt have 6/18 worth of stats out by turn 4

Its impossible for a warlock to have that much stats out by turn 4, not to mention why is it a problem that warlock cheats out big minions when big priest has been doing it for ages?

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","Not the person you asked but I'll chime my opinion in.

- Socioeconomic factors first and foremost. As others have said, most of our crime is concentrated in specific areas. If you want to combat the elephant in the room you address crime in low income neighborhoods-these are the bulk of American violence. You can drive through most of America, especially in rural areas where guns and hunting are prevalent, and feel safe while meeting friendly, happy people. The areas people will tell you to avoid? That's where gang and drug violence dominate. But fixing those problems are complicated and require tackling difficult issues like education where actual effort needs to be made versus focusing on the NRA and AR-15s.

- Culture comes into play. A good many Americans are way too preoccupied with violence and a somewhat twisted sense of justice-there are way too many people out there who see this as an effective means of solving problems. This also ties in with an inherent distrust with authority-somewhat ironic where, especially here in Reddit they'll simultaneously write off cops and authority figures as thugs and criminals while pushing for gun control measures that ultimately require expanding their powers and stripping citizens of their individual protections. But that's a whole nother animal. 

- I do believe that mental health comes into play but, again, fixing that isn't as simple as it's being made out to be. Healthcare in the US is expensive and simply tying healthcare treatment to gun ownership will drive people live veterans away from seeking help out of fear of having their rights stripped after a diagnosis.

Use the ult more for the passive lifesteal than the damage. 
His build and playstles are rather flexible. You can play him as a sustained damage warrior build (BP, PS, TT) a burst crit assasin build (TB, SB, TM) an Utility jungler(SS, PS, TT) or even the legendary captain glaive (hard to pull off, standard captain build with echo and aftershock)
He can be played in jungle (recommended) carry (difficult) or even captain (very hard)
Be careful when using energy, as he’s very energy reliant
Dash behind enemies when using A to punt them away from safety
An advanced tactic is to wait after dashing to bait out the reflex block before basic attacking and getting the punt.
Use B right after basic attacks for best damage potential.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","I have several thoughts on this. One is that people tend to view the world with a 'single-issue voter' mentality, its easier but also tends to provide large blind spots. To that regard stats people tend to over value the importance of cleanliness, structure and repeatability etc. If I look at someones work output and think ""why are they even still employed here, I'd fire them so fast!"" and they aren't fired, they are likely bringing value to the organization they which I am blind to. If you think accurate assessments are valuable then self reflection is highly important in those situations.

The second is that people learn things if they think its valuable. E.g. almost anyone with more than a passing interest in sports is deep into stats regardless of their profession. Getting adoption on data cleanliness, structure around data flows etc. tends to be about showing the value. There is also the circumstance component, they need to be in the right frame of mind to receive the info. This may involve repeated attempts across various projects and through various perspectives (go all out ML algo, try all sorts of shit and see what methods are effective then do more of that).

And lastly, sometimes personalities just collide and its not going to work. There is multiple approaches to that problem from wait it out till someone sees through their shit to corporate assassination to finding another job.",1519862855

"berkeley","t5_2qh9w","Yeah, but it's risky to jack off if you're that close without alarming the couple and thus compromising their fuck session, thereby putting your own jack off session in jeopardy and depriving you and the rest of the neighbors of a good show and solid jack off material. Now, I'll admit that there's always the possibility that the couple doesn't mind or is too preoccupied with their own activities to care or even notice someone being that close; much less likely, but still plausible, is the possibility that they don't mind said person jerking off while watching them have sex up close.

However, one does not know for sure how the couple will react to someone being both close and jerking off. Perhaps they don't care if someone watches up close. But let's say that they don't. If they happen to see you watching them, that might prompt them to get up and leave. Thus, depriving you and your friends of some good jack off material. Moreover, let's say they're okay with you watching them, that doesn't automatically mean they're also okay with you jerking off at the same time. These are two actives that create distinct levels of alarm. One is more benign and only somewhat creepy; after all, if someone is having sex in public you can't really blame a person walking by too much for simply watching. However, the other (jerking off) is both inherently vulgar and conspicuous and carries a high chance that it will alarm the couple and prompt them to get up and leave in disgust. 

In short, one might be acceptable, but not the other. Or both may be equally unacceptable to the couple. You just don't know. Again, by getting that close you run the risk of ruining your jerk off session by cutting it short and depriving the neighbors of solid material because the couple might stop having sex and get up and leave because they're too uncomfortable and creeped out not only by your presence, but by the fact that you’re masturbating to them as well. 

That's why I believe utilizing the binoculars is the best strategy here. That is, if you plan on jerking off while you watch them. It allows you to both watch the couple in action from a safe and innocuous distance and jerk off at the same without alarming them and running the risk that you'll scare them off. In addition, there’s also the risk associated with jerking off in public; it can get you in serious trouble. But back to the binoculars, they may not be the most optimal method of viewing the action, for I'd rather be up close. But it terms of risk management, it's the safest route to go. And these aren’t ordinary binoculars we’re talking about here, they're strong ones. So, as an alternative, it isn’t too bad when you consider the risks.

"singapore","t5_2qh8c","So much fail in this comment.

&gt; with ministers pay linked to gdp (instead of something more useful like median citizens wage)

This is false. Ministers receive a [National Bonus](http://www.ifaq.gov.sg/PSD/mobile/index.aspx#Detaildoc/34258) (up to 3 months) which is linked to 1) median income growth, 2) income growth of the bottom 20%, 3) unemployment and 4) GDP growth. Since all 4 socio-economic indicators receive equal weightage (25%), income growth is actually more important than GDP growth when it comes to determining ministerial pay.

&gt; how faster is trains gonna wear and tear and spoil cos more ppl are stuffed into the same train carriage?

Yes, SMRT should discourage people from using the MRT by removing train doors and increasing fares. This will lead to less wear and tear, and solve the MRT reliability issues without having to do stupid things like maintenance /s

"ClashOfClans","t5_2usfk","Base building is extremely difficult. It takes a lot of dedication, creativity, trial and error as well as knowledge of the game and mechanics. [This](http://cocland.com/guides/in-depth-base-building-guide) guide gave me a good start at determining several aspects to consider. I bet you can make a lot of improvements by just following some of the stuff in the guide. Most people just google for bases, the more dedicated watch replays of high tier competitive clash of clans on youtube and then copy and/or edit those bases. The bases from videos are usually not spammed in the internet, so obviously not as well known. I've tried building my own bases several times but it's just an extremely long road to go down to. I'm guessing it must take years to be experienced enough to come up with a good layout by myself. You can determine your basic warweight by making a challenge in chat. Let someone scout one of your war bases and tell you how much you have in one storage. Multiply that number by 5 and add 1000. As a reference, TH9 max is 90.000 if I remember correctly. What the war weight exactly is and how it's calculated exactly would be better described by the wiki  or just google it. There's tons of material on it. Base 1 for example easy to lure cc, queen easy to reach, very AD heavy on one side and unprotected by sweepers etc. Base 2 AQ extra walling unnecessary, she walks out of it anyway. Again very heavy AD on one side, base seems a bit narrow so one jump almost opens a complete passage through it. Large trash rings are buffers but just seems a bit much just like the ""4 corner base"". Base 3 looks a bit too compact for a solid anti 3 war base, also symmetrical bases are kinda out of the meta and easier to attack. I didn't look too much into the bases, just some first thoughts that came to my mind. I am sure you can find a lot of answers in build guides such as I linked. I hope that helps.

No, it most certainly is not. That's not what bias is. If the result is objectively accurate and reached indiscriminately, there is no bias. what you have is a statistical anomaly. either the data set needs more data, or the anomaly is correct. It is a problem, but not bias. It's something else entirely that probably requires a lot more consideration than anyone wants to admit. 

&gt;The AI in this case is just determining that people with a higher number of past offenses tend to be, say, black, or people with a certain income tend to be black...Proceed to: It will obviously determine that black people are more likely to be a flight risk than other people, based on the data set. And it will, in turn, lead black individuals to be treated unfairly because they are black.

- When it comes to the anime, I have to admit that I never really watched it. Only sporadically. So it makes sense that I only really care about the OG guys. Pikachu, Ash, Misty, Rocko, Jessie, James and Meowth. (I can't believe I remembered all of those, oh oh oh the Oaks)

Do you have an investing account with RBC and level 2 quotes? As I said before, it's more like there are not enough active traders that use RBC to even care about it. Active traders will either use IB, ToS, or Questrade. I can give you an example. Let's say a stock is around $12.10. This what what you might see:

Bid:
12.09 100
12.05 100
12.04 100
11.98 100
11.93 9300
11.92 100
11.91 100
11.90 100
11.89 100
11.88 100
11.50 200
11.45 100
11.45 100
11.45 100
11.45 100
11.45 100
11.45 100
11.45 100

Ask:
12.11 100
12.12 100
12.14 100
12.15 100
12.40 9300
12.41 100
12.42 100
12.43 200
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100
12.45 100

The bids and asks are almost always symmetrical across any stock you look at. Not to mention, like I said before, I have an order for 500 shares at 11.85, but then it doesn't show up on the list. I can take screenshots tomorrow if you really want.

Something that capitalism's apologists never seem to get is that the worker is heavily exploited under capitalism. The whole system of economics under capitalism is simply unsustainable. Things aren't worth whatever the consumer is willing to pay, they're worth the resources that went into making them. That's the only way you can sustain an economy indefinitely. Capitalists undervalue labor, minerals, and other material in pretty much everything that is produced. By assigning these goods a more sensible price, as would be inevitable under socialism, their true value would become available. In a sense, you are right.

I love to use cavemen as examples for these kinds of things.  What would be an alpha caveman? A big, strong, mean, murderous son of a bitch. If you were a cave woman what would you do? You would fuck that guy and get him to protect you, doing whatever it means to keep it that way. And if a bigger, stronger, meaner, more murderous son of a bitch comes along? You're gonna fuck that guy and get that deal with him after he kills the last one.  So who has more ""power""? Power is the ability to obtain.

It's simply biologicallly impossible to have ass without thighs or vice versa. They are equal sides of the same stone. They are both the ultimate and final precious portions of pleasure. On the other hand, tits are simply larger chests filled with fat and milk. Children need breasts, losers who haven't grown up drool over breasts, but at the end of the day, they are secondary components and if you focus on them you are automatically a laymen. Honestly, compared to an ass, what can you do with the breasts? Suck on them, jiggle them? Notice these are all things that you can also do with the ass. ""B-but they've got milk and they're so soft."" Any true woman is soft everywhere, fool. Where is the actual source of life and reproduction which is the true purpose of any organism? In the ass.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;	In recent months, Mueller’s team has questioned witnesses in detail about Trump’s private comments and state of mind in late July and early August of last year, around the time he issued a series of tweets belittling his “beleaguered” attorney general, these people said.

I'm sure you all know a lot about them so I'm just speaking out my ass.

"StopGaming","t5_2tjkc","Sure, 

For starters I’d recommend “The willpower instinct” by Kelly McGonigal. It is not about addiction, but builds a crucial foundation for understanding how your mind works.

Then I’d continue with “The addictive brain”, it’s only in audiobook format, in audible.com. Really excellent resource.

And then... the main course: “Easy way to quit smoking” by Allen Carr. This book is amazing and I cannot recommend it enough. For ANY addiction.

“This Naked Mind” by Annie Grace is pretty good, it talks about alcohol addiction and is kind of a similar approach than Easy Way. Again, recommended for ANY addiction.

Other than this, I recommend studying about how addiction works, biologically. Having a deep understanding of neural networks, the pathways of dopamine, delta FosB accumulation, etc., takes a lot of time to learn but I found it all helps build a more solid approach towards one’s own addictions. Just google those subjects and start there.

Consistently studying and practicing a philosophy of life like Stoicism or Buddhism can also be a great tool in this journey.",1519862868

"ptsd","t5_2qm0x","I’m late on this but I’ll jump it too. Motocross used to be a huge part of my life as well. Gym five days a week, out at practice on Fridays and Saturdays, and racing every Sunday. If I wasn’t racing, I was watching GoPro footage and finding new places to improve. I got hurt, got off the bike for a while, and the racing scene basically disappeared where I lived. I got diagnosed with PTSD soon after and things were never really the same. 
It’s hard for me to even find motivation to go ride anymore. I used to get so excited to go out riding, I could barley sleep the night before. If I finally muster up the motivation, I feel the same as you once I’m back on the bike. I was planning on racing again this year, but I can’t get past my fears. 
I wish I had something to say to you, some magic words to help you past this and get back on the bike the way things used to be. All I have to offer is that you’re not alone, I’m struggling through the same. I hope you can get back on the bike and enjoy it soon",1519862869

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","Yeah, there are 2 sets of mandatory story missions, but I think there's a lot of flexibility in how you get there. Since travel time brings you closer, you have the option of taking sub-optimal nearby missions or focusing on particular missions that are further away. Plus there's the endless mode, which pushes you to go on for as long as you can. In the end, though, there are a ton of other flexibility options that bring me to keep playing.

And no, war doesn't need that. I gave you the definition for an unsolemn declaration of war (defined by the UN, using the international definition standard that you insisted on having), which describes this situation to a tee, and you refused to even acknowledge that while responding to a rhetorical question shows me you are not interested in discussing facts.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Ask yourself this question, and answer it HONESTLY: how would you have reacted if the texts had been from a guy friend? If the same exact content from a guy wouldn't have upset you, you need to try and see things from your bf's point of view and realize that you overreacted. The idea that being in a relationship means you're not allowed to have friends or spend time with other people of your preferred gender is really gross, and it says nothing good about you or how much you trust your partner (but that's a whole other matter). Don't place the blame for your ""feeling crazy"" on your boyfriend's shoulders - if you're feeling that way, it's because you're acting that way, and he's well within his rights to stand his ground. If he seemed tired talking about it, maybe it's because having to defend yourself against things you shouldn't have to defend is freaking exhausting. 

Trying to come between your bf and his friend will almost certainly lead you the exact opposite of where you want it to. This girl has been his friend long before he knew you, and chances are that she'll be his friend after you, if you keep flipping out about things that aren't a big deal. If I were to cut ties with everyone I'd previously kissed (or - gasp! - done more with) whenever I got into a relationship, most of my dearest friends would have been tossed aside years ago, and I can't think of a single romantic partner that I would say would have been worth that kind of loss. 

I get you're upset, and (believe it or not) I do understand where you're coming from, but I've been there, and done that, and I'm speaking as someone who's had to learn some very important lessons in very, very painful ways. It took some serious soul-searching and reflection to accept that my relationships weren't being destroyed by my boyfriend's friendships with other women, but by my own insecurity and resulting inability to trust him the way that he trusted me. He's with YOU. Try and accept that this means he *wants* to be with you. He's made that choice. You. Not her. Okay?",1519862869
