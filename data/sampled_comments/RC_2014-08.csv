"self","t5_2qh96","Alright my man, I got some advice for you:

1. If you don't already start working out. When I was a freshman in highschool, this helped build my confidence dramatically. You notice yourself get in shape and you feel like you look good.

2. You're 17, most likely you're a senior in highschool. So you know what, fuck what everyone else thinks of you(except maybe your gf lol). I know this is easier said than done, but trust me it's worth it. 

3. See a therapist if you are able to

4. I get your mom verbally abuses you, but based on what you're telling me I don't know if she cares about you or doesn't. Would you say your mom loves you(personal question I know) becaus if she does TALK TO HER. Hell even if you think she doesn't care about you talk to her anyways, she might have a hard time expressing her feelings idk I'm no psychiatrist. 

5. Don't have much advice on your gf situation, I personally suck at relationships. But you know, she sounds like she cares about you and all girls are different. Just because a few girls cheated on you doesn't mean she will. 

Hopefully this all helps, if you need any more advice or have any questions just respond or PM me!","1406851201"

"BasicIncome","t5_2v1jk","That's about the single most useless statement I've seen on this subreddit.    
    
First off, any generation of voters would be the change, not just the young ones. Add that only about half of the US population that's eligible to vote actually does so, and you're looking at a pretty massive tip of the scales if that power was mobilized.    
    
Second, there would be survival. More people would realize that Congress isn't a bunch of idiots. Further they are a collection or largely two teams, not one that just fucks around. They might also realize that Congress is usually in dead lock and ""gets nothing done"" (a funny statement, because they get a hell of a lot done, actually) because you have the two sides butting heads.    
    
Scientific information honestly doesn't mean shit in Congressional interest for the most part anyway. Yes, global warming, conservation, food and safety concerns (I can't help laughing a little about this topic because they're so deregulated today that we would literally have companies who must report their own fuckups, which means companies are more safe today than ever before, at least on paper), and other issues matter, but you have other areas such as economics where it muddies the waters and a few dollars means more than bickering over a melting ice cap because the money is here and the ice is WAY over there.    
    
But really the majority of Americans could give two shits about science. Confirmation bias is fun and people love that, no matter if the facts don't back it up (10% of the brain? They made a hit movie about that shit not so long ago that's raking in the dough. Or Gravity which blew the doors off of theaters and set records in sales, but is painfully unrealistic). Science fiction is huge, sure, but even ""nerds"" and ""geeks"" are rarely fans of actual science. I could list many more examples of that behavior, but long story short, even those who lean that direction honestly don't like science.

I went to a primary school for the performing arts, and at the end of each year, all of the arts programs got together to put on a school-wide production of Broadway's greatest hits. I'm in the 3rd grade orchestra. I'm 2nd Chair, only because my friend Brian took private lessons after school. I'm not bitter. Anyway, our teacher decided we weren't going to practice that day. We were having more of a recital meeting, which is when he told us the gruesome story of Sweeney Todd.

http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2c8p4u/today_australian_retail_workers_are_in_for_a/cjdc2ur

In Australia, so far there aren't many phones can use NFC with the Paypass/Paywave system directly, although Commonwealth Bank has some trials going on with certain Samsung models.  The problem is that banks want to be very strict about any hardware that has the potential to interact with their equipment (the NFC readers at the merchants).   I do like the idea since potentially the phone could turn off the NFC element if not unlocked (or similar), making it more secure than a 'dumb' card that has no user interaction.

"Destiny","t5_2qnvz","Here's the thing. He says it's a waste of time and everyone is a shitter autist when they cheese him but as I pointed out in chat earlier, Destiny's strongest game is his late game and sometimes even mid-game attacks when he feels like it. So if I was matched up against him and knowing that I can't beat him in a late game. I'm most likely going to cheese or at the least a 2 base all-in.

Obviously people that can beat him in a macro game won't mind playing one since they know that are better than him (koreans and otherwise)

So I find it very deconstructive instead of working on defending these autistic cheese builds he just calls them worthless and wastes of time.

IMO this is THE main thing holding him back in tournament settings. It's common knowledge you have a better chance to win by cheesing or a well planned all-in than going to the later game. If battle.net had the kind of stats that GSL has, you would see Destiny win% in a game longer than 18 mins is probably over 60%. Literally only need to get to the late game safely and he would win so much more. That's my opinion","1406851209"

As long as there are divisions of society then nations will exist as representations of language/culture/religion etc. Unfortunately, should one divest oneself of any particular affiliation, that does not imply that all others do so too. Consequently, as long as the security situation requires it, there exists a need for a large state to enforce even secular, non-nationalistic, pacifistic or anarchistic presence.

Conceivably, one could live without any contrivance of ideology, but the problem of others requires force to maintain such an atmosphere.

If you are doing two coats (and by asking if you are I am implying you should) roll the first coat out and then do the cut in. Cheat with your cut in away from your line just a little. For the second coat cut one wall in and straighten your lines then roll the wall out and move on.","1406851211"

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","Of course this is a very personal decision, so I can only speak to what I think I'd feel if I were in your position. 

Can you afford to live on the private school salary for 1-2 years? Will you be able to pay your loans and rent, etc? If so, I think it sounds like a good opportunity. Besides the pay, you sound excited talking about it - and it's a real teaching job, in your field, which is nothing to laugh at! Since it does start earlier than your local public schools, I think if you get close to the beginning of the year for the private school, it would be easiest for you to just commit to the job for the year (less stress in wondering where you'll be, worrying about interviews/applications, etc. in addition to planning for the new year!). 

You have the rest of forever to get back into public schools and the experience of teaching multiple levels in your field will be very valuable.

Good luck with your decision! ","1406851212"

What happens when you have children? If your parents don't accept him they may not accept your children or will accept them but still be standoffish towards your husband whereby putting your children in the middle of respecting their father and respecting their grand parents.

Either way your choices are limited will have take extreme action. Either marry this man and just deal with the fact your parents will forever not accept the situation or not marry him and deal the anger and resentment towards your parents.

If you have someone who your parents respects speak on this guy behalf then maybe they will agree. Otherwise, this situation it's not going to end well.

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","I guess it comes down to how much you care about money.  If you don't care, then yeah, sure, get your peace of mind and have it towed to a shop and get it looked at.  It will depend a lot on the shop you go to.  I'd bet that many shops will just put some fresh gas in it and have a new guy drive it for 20 miles and see what's wrong with it then give it back to you and charge you (this really isn't really that bad or dishonest, it's just that it's a lot more efficient to solve obvious problems than to look carefully for future problems and will depend a lot on the shop's style).  Other shops might preemptively blow out the lines, change the filter, and do a bunch of other stuff, etc...


If you're a little adventurous, you can do most of the stuff yourself.  If the tank is not very full, then a full tank of new gas will probably dilute most of what's in there and it will run well enough to let you know if anything has really dried up between the tank and the injectors, or other valve cover gaskets etc.  If the tank is full and you know what to do with your old gas (check local environmental regulations), you can pump it out with a cheap fluid transfer pump, and replace it with fresh gas--I'd bet you'd be fine doing this.  I would predict that it will crank for a while before it fires up.  Just check the oil (and coolant) before you do this to make sure some weird thing didn't drain it all out of there.


Then take it to a shop and get all the other fluids changed--don't forget to change your brake fluid which has probably absorbed some water.  Look very very carefully at the tires (head over to /r/justrolledintotheshop to learn more about old tires gone bad), I'd just replace them if you can afford it, some people would probably disagree.  


Overall I'd say it's probably fine, most cars like to run;  a car that has sat for a long time will probably lose some life over the long run but you'll be fine.  It's much worse with old cars and old carburetors and cork gaskets that dry up, crack and leak.  I bet your car will be fine.  Just throw a battery in it and drive it.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","It was a decision that made good sense at the time. When my agent first did the deal with Night Shade (my US publisher), we had a few UK publishers interested, so she thought I had a decent chance of selling UK/Aus rights to them.  Plus, my agent had already heard some ominous things about Night Shade, so selling only North American rights was a way of hedging our bets.  She thought if things went bad with NS, retaining some English-language rights would ensure I still had other options.  (This was a very good move on her part, as NS did indeed almost go bankrupt.  If they had, and I had sold them World English rights, my series would have vanished into a black hole of bankruptcy court for many years.  But thankfully I knew that even if they did go bankrupt, I could always publish an English-language version in the UK &amp; import to US.)

Aaaaanyway.  As it turned out, a UK deal never quite materialized, and NS got bought out and the new owners pulled the DRM-free versions.  But that's the way things go in publishing: you make the best decisions you can with the info you have at the time.  Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.

Make sure this is done before you even take a step towards a car deal. Don't talk to any car dealers until you've sorted out and gotten approved financial deal.

 As for lease/buy, depends on?
-do you always wants a car payment but love having a newer-ish car and dont drive too far? lease is ok, but i'm hard pressed to ever endorse a lease. For me, buying car is only way because on leases, there's always some trigger sticking in your business, checking how many miles you drive, dings/dents on the car, and some pressure to change or upgrade your car (and keep you on a lease).

If mazda3 looks good, check into the other similar models and do compare/contrast. Don't sweat going to dealers and test driving, they'll hard press you, but just do it anyways. I use to feel bad for the sales guy if i walked, but do it. Be comfortable walking away from the dealer, dont listen to 'last and best deal' etc.  

if possible, check into just renting whatever car you are hard core thinking about..the 15min test drive never reveals all likes/dislikes, but will be revealed if rent a car over a day or weekend.

anyhow have fun car shopping, i actually like it now..

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's really hard to do a test like that because pepsi and coke are generally the same thing (but do have different recipes). Personally I notice a difference in the taste between different fountains (say at a gas station versus a movie theater or something) with just pepsi alone. I also notice a difference between bottled and canned pepsi, both of those are also different in taste from fountain. It has to do with the amount of syrup added to the carbonated water. I do notice a difference between coke and pepsi. I like coke, but I like pepsi better, if there isn't pepsi, I will take coke sometimes.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","She sat, somber, tears making their way down her cheeks. Earth's light, dimming with each passing second, reflected in her eyes.

Darkness was surrounding her. All of the stars and galaxies seemed too far away. Sadness seemed to pull her heart against her chest, as her child lay dying in her arms.

As the light went out, tears clouded her eyes. A sob escaped, bringing with it the rushing pain of loss. She succumbed to it, and lay weeping into the darkness. The void did nothing to comfort her.

She lay crying for a long time.

Finally, she sat up, wiping tears away. She looked out over the great expanse. The thought of moving on and not knowing how to enveloped her in fear. It was paralyzing.

In the distance, something caught her eye. Just a glint of light among all the other glints of light in the void.

A star was radiating it's light in the distance. The light bounced off surrounding stars and planets, but it was glinting off something specific.

She wiped her eyes and squinted. She held hear breath, not wanting to hope.

Suddenly, she smiled.

The light traveled from the star to a distant planet. She could just barely make it out, but from where she sat she knew what it was.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","First wash the walls good with TSP to get a clean wall to start with, doing your spackling at this point. We've had good luck with the Glidden Gripper primer available at Home Depot. For the paint, we like the Valspar that Lowe's sells, Consumer Reports had Valspar listed as their #2 pick for paint behind Benjamin Moore but Valspar is much cheaper. Most of the rest of the stuff both Lowe's and Home Depot sells is not very good quality IMO. 

For a bathroom you'll  probably want to go with a semi-gloss paint which withstands moisture better but will show up defects in the wall or painting technique moreso than a flat or eggshell finish will. Do not skimp on the quality of your roller cover, every bit of lint coming off the roller will show up in the paint. I would suggest going with an off-white or antique white rather than a bright white because the bright white is hard on the eyes and looks dingy quickly.

Don't be shy about trying out a high-contrast dark color for your trim if you're going with a white wall, or if it's a larger bathroom maybe consider doing a two-color wall with the bottom 36"" (wainscot or chair-rail height) a darker color. 

Edit to add: Latex paint is mostly water used as a carrier to get the pigments and the solids on the wall, the solids weigh more than the water so generally the heavier the paint, the more solids and the better the quality.

"KDRAMA","t5_2rqv6","Episode 10....I'm pretty sure Mi Young still didn't sign the contract, right? I mean I looked when evil courtesan picked it up and didn't see a signature (I think). It seems like a contract wouldn't be legally binding if both parties hadn't signed it, at least. Also, no one noted that the money stipulation had been crossed out. I'm a little annoyed these things didn't come up. But I guess the problem is that the contract existed at all.

I don't think it's possible for Gun to go back now. He's obviously in love with Mi Young and *really* attracted to her (his hungry looks are making me crazy), so the only way I can think of for this show to mine any drama out of Se Ra, et al. is to trot out noble idiocy a la ""I have hurt her so much and she has been miserable with me, she's better off without me in her life,"" and ""he never wanted to be with me in the first place so I'll quietly stay out of his life like I promised,"" etc. Ugh.

Also, a lot of the savings get wasted in the 24 hour turnaround time. Those 10 American programmers can get something written, reviewed, changed, and re-reviewed in an afternoon. That same process might take a week for overseas developers, just by virtue of being 12 timezones away.","1406851230"

"hoggit","t5_2tifv","There is one issue with using the TGP for targeting that I am aware of and that is when you set the SPI with the TGP at a low altitude the TGP actually will target the ground through the vehicle that you are targeting. So imagine the line from the TGP to and through the target and on to the ground. The point where that line hits the ground is the actual place that the bomb is going to hit. That said, if the line through the target does not hit the ground elevation because it is on a hill or you are targeting at a very low angle the actual impact point could be off many meters. Even with this I don't know if it is going to be 100 to 200 meters as you experienced. However with a few other variables you could experience those distances. I Hope you understand what I am trying to describe here. In other words the closer to and higher you are when you set your SPI the more accurate the bomb hits will be.","1406851233"

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","Interesting take on replacing Harvest with Earthens. I can see it. It also in effect replaces Healing Touch since, so you're trading 3 cards in for 2, which is nice.

Personally if I would make changes, if I wanted to go more minion heavy, I'd probably take out Starfall and Thalnos for 2 Sludge Belchers, been loving the card in Ramp Taunt so far. I understand Starfall and Thalnos can be good against Zoo and Shaman, both problem decks for Druid, but at the same time they usually need to be played as part of a combo (Thalnos especially obviously) and this deck doesn't have strong card draw to begin with. On the otherhand, Sludge Belcher is also good against Zoo and decent against Shamans and can just be played as is. Also against mid/control match ups, having Sludges gives me the ability to play Druid of the Claws in Charge form much more liberally, which usually lets me trade or remove threats efficiently, which was always a problem with Ramp.

Also, this is more off kilter, but I'd probably remove one Ancient of War with a Loathub. I know it seems weird to take one of your biggest taunts out of your deck, but I find that having two usually just ends up clogging my hand, so expensive you're basically devoting an entire turn to it, and usually the fate of the game is decided already whether you win or lose by then if it's coming to that. I just put Loathub in there because Ramp has such a bad match up against Miracle (double Sap says hi) that it's my anti-Miracle tech card. If Loathub wasn't out, I'd put the 2nd AoW in there probably, but with the addition of 2 Sludge Belchers especially, I think there's enough taunts already. I rather have a good solid tech card (that's not bad on stats either) than add an 11th taunt to an already taunt heavy deck.","1406851233"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","When discussing the realism of Downton abbey, it's important to keep in mind that it's not just based on a general view of the time periods and social classes as a whole. There are real life role models for some of the characters. 

The central story is based around the in-law family of the writer Julian Fellowes, his wife, just like Mary in the story, was unable to inherit her father's title. 

There will be aspects which are atypical for the setting and character types, but which fit the real life narratives on which pars of it are loosely based.

The foolish thing is that all of this is happening without you even having a romantic relationship with this person. You barely even get to visit him.

You're not betraying him if you talk to other guys. I mean, what's the worst that can happen if you open yourself up to meeting someone? Sure, there's some you won't like. Eventually, though, a guy will come along that you'll click with.

You're letting an unrealistic obsession keep you from living your life. That's unhealthy and an issue. Of course you think no one's out there — you're refusing to even take a look.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","We know hamas is using civilian areas to launch  attacks from. This is an unarguable fact. Israel has a right to wipe out its aggressors. Israel has to choose between not attacking, and continue to be a victim, or Israel can attack and palestine will incurr civilian casualties,  which are solely the fault of hamas, not of Israel. Hamas knows exactly what it is doing,  and it is successfully marrying it's own citizens for nothing more than propaganda that Israel is ""intentionally killing kids""...  Which couldn't be further from. The truth. 

Israels practice of ""roof knocking"" is an example of Israel trying to warn civilians and allow them to leave.  Israel is also allowing for undeserved humanitarian cease fires,  to which hamas re-engages. 

Israel does not want to kill civilians, if they did,  there would be mary more dead civilians. But this I literally a war. It is close quarters,  and the ""enemy"" is using human shields. 

What would you have Israel do instead? 

I do not wish war or death on anyone,  but it is my opinion that Israel has waited long enough,  has done their due diligence to avoid civilian deaths whilst still aggressively attacking it's ""enemy"". 

Israel has tolerated quite a bit,  more than any reasonable nation should have to tolerate. 

To refute you're analogy,  if blowing your head off is the only way to get you to stop punching me,  then I will blown your head off.  If you put your family in front of yourself as a shield,  then I will go through your family to get to you. I will stop you from punching me, it is your choice to shield yourselves with innocdmts. I will not be held captive by your decisions to use human shields,  my safety is priority. The safety of you family is a distant second,  especially when you are attacking me from behind them. Israel is not going out of its way to intentionally kill Innocents, and if anyone thinks that Israel is intentionally killing innocents,  that is their own sick fantasy.

No its not gonna be 30 seconds. Your reaction time starts at the moment you hear explosion, because you will never see it coming. At that moment i can drop lower and finish sunderer with explosive xbow and grenade launcher. If you can react and start repairing within 3-4 seconds after initial C4 explosion, GG to you. This is probably riskiest move and i only use it when i cannot access the sundy with wraith. But then again, nobody ever uses mineguard so i don't really need to do this like.... ever.

no, i drop right next to your sunderer, throw sticky and 2 mines instantly after it, i need only 1 second for this. That's not enough for you to even realise im around.

And farmers often buy seeds from several different companies, because farmers have many, many fields often times. They'll plant some fields with Monsanto, some with Pioneer, some with Bayer, etc. There is no monopoly to speak of. Any of the farmers I work with every day will tell you the same.","1406851241"

Organizations like the CIA, with an estimated 20,000 employees and a multi-billion dollar budget, are behemoths, operating with an extremely, almost infinitely complex web of interlocking wheels and cogs. These kinds of bureaucratic institutions exist to perpetuate themselves, to become more and more complex in structure and form.

 The D/CIA certainly has an amount of power over their organization's overall direction, but they really just nudge it in very small degrees.

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","An AC2 PS4 version would require a lot more though because the game is older... just not old enough to warrant a complete makeover. It wouldn't be a simple remastering in 1080p 60fps, it would have to be basically a complete remake from the ground up. Games like TLOU and GTA V aren't that far away from what we're getting from PS4 titles, the leap in technology isn't so big this time. Like [this](http://www.gamepur.com/files/images/2014/the-last-of-us-ps4-vs-ps3-comparison.jpg) for instance - it looks better, but they aren't worlds apart. To someone who doesn't know much about games, they'd probably just think they made his hair lighter. Meanwhile AC2's graphics, particularly the character models... well, [they don't look that great.](http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/350/0/6/ezio_auditore__assassin__s_creed_2__by_nylah22-d5o8fqr.png) They would have to pretty much do everything again from scratch for it to look good. And it's not old enough for that to really be worth doing. It's not so old that it doesn't hold up well, and not new enough that it could simply get a facelift like TLOU did.

The upshot is: ""it's not impossible that there was a Trojan War, but the available Bronze Age evidence does not *corroborate* the historicity of the war -- it only tells us that it's not *completely* impossible"". Going beyond that involves weighing up probabilities, more than evidence as such.

So why are you taking the word of someone who represents 1% of the scientific community and [who has changed his stance a large number of times after the source of his skepticism has been discovered to be definitively bullshit?](http://www.skepticalscience.com/lindzen-illusion-7-the-anti-galileo.html) Is there any reason you value his repeatedly wrong-as-hell view vs. the 99% of remaining scientists? Is he somehow more trustworthy than those scientists who don't shift their goalposts to prevent addressing underlying flaws in their preconceived notions?

&gt;But instead of trying to debate the issue at hand you must resort to attacking the credentials of the author of one article.

Because in this case it's important. The author *doesn't* have credentials, and he's disagreeing with a massive body of published literature by pretending he has the ability to interpret the data. To use the previous brain surgeon example, if your Harvard philosopher is in a room full of brain surgeons and insists that the problem isn't a tumour but is in fact an ill humour that has been wedged in the patients frontal lobe then ""you have no idea what you're talking about"" is actually a valid criticism. Besides, if you actually cared about the ""issue"" then you'd care about evidence rather than partisan hacks.","1406851256"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Good luck.  You should be OK, you are 17 and she knows you have a boyfriend.  Asking for and about birth control shows that you are being responsible.   Just tell her you are ready to have sex and want to be on the birth control to make sure you don't get pregnant, if you aren't comfortable telling her you already had it. You can get it without her help if necessary from a county clinic, but it's a lot smoother if everyone is in the loop; contraception is covered if you have health insurance, it won't cost extra.

I have raised 2 past teen years now and both did initiate the convos about birth control, no freakouts here.  I think it shows maturity and waited for them to ask for birth control rather than pushing it, we were always pretty open about sex though so I wasn't worried they were doing it and hiding it.

"socialjustice101","t5_2vjn1","13-17 year olds are sexually *developing* people, and do not all mature at the same rate.  They need to be allowed to grow into their sexuality in their own time, on their own terms.  The sexualization of minors by adults takes away their agency and control over their own sexual development.

Refraining from sexualizing someone is not the same as desexualizing them.  Both sexualization and desexualization deny the individual their sexual agency, albeit in different ways.  Whereas refraining from either leaves the sexual agency in the hands of the individual.  An adult who refuses to sexualize a minor does not deny them their sexuality.  It just leaves them to develop their sexuality in their own way.  

Perhaps an analogy will help.  If I give something to you, or I take something from you, those are both acts, as opposed to omissions.  But if I neither give nor take anything, then that is an omission, and there is no direct effect on you.  There may be indirect effects, but these are incidental, not inherent.  For example, if I give you some food, then you eat.  If I take food away from you, you go hungry.  If I neither give nor take food, you may or may not go hungry depending on whether you already have food in your possession.  Similarly, sexualization and desexualization are acts, not omissions.  Doing neither has no direct and inherent effect on a person.  It may have an incidental effect, depending on whether that person happens to be sexual or not, but given a lack of knowledge regarding that, the best course of action is to do neither, because both have the potential to be harmful.

You don't understand: we're talking about privatizing national oil companies in countries like Libya, Iraq, etc. Not about new exploration. 

&gt;Almost every business in the world must rely on and pay for the cost of doing business and oil is just another component. They try to hedge and manage that variable as much as possible at the end of the day they have no alternative and have little to no leverage to negotiate the most important, valuable and highest demand commodity on the planet.  

Mostly above my pay grade, but just taking the United States, every good or service that depends on the transportation network (as in, all consumer goods), all manufacturing, agriculture prices, even transportation costs for commuters adds up to a hell of a lot of political pressure. Those constituencies leverage many trillions of dollars more than the energy industry can control. The 2000s energy crisis pissed off a lot of powerful people, some with lobbying arms as big as those of the energy industry, because even when the good times were rolling before the financial crisis, energy was taking a huge bite out of a lot of bottom lines.

There's something called ""5 love languages"" (http://www.5lovelanguages.com/) which is a study that says people prefer different forms of affection - eg gifts, spending quality time, doing favors for one another, etc. So perhaps your girlfriend just doesn't see gift giving as a form of love and affection as you and I do and this isn't an act of thoughtlessness.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Haven't really struggled with this, although one of my dueling partners tends to use aliens quite a bit. One strategy is to punish them for not having any minions down by destroying any minions they do leave on the base (attempting to deny them any points from the base at all) and taking advantage of the turns they use just grinding vp. 

I have noticed plants tend to get punished pretty hard by aliens (because their abilities take time to get off) but they can excel other ways. 

In a 1v1 game the key thing is to push bases that have at least a 2-point difference between first and second, and make sure they never get full points. Aliens have slightly lowered power, so when this is combined with their self-returning they're going to struggle to stay on the bases. Make sure to pressure their invaders if possible, either through destruction or breaking the base. Don't try to play their own game against them, they're obviously going to be better at it. Otherwise, something like bears will prevent them from returning their own minions if they don't want to get wombo comboed, and the bears' superior power will allow them to take first most of the time. 

Counters off the top of my head:

**Tricksters** - force them to discard crush cards/invaders

**Robots** - kill the invaders, swarm the base

**Ninjas** - kill the invaders, easy enough, use specials if they're ever about to win a base 

**Dinosaurs** - crush the bases before they have any opportunity to establish a presence

**Spies** - attack their invaders while they're still in their hand, use specials if they're ever about to win a base.

**Apes** - overpower the base, similar to dinosaurs

**Ghosts** - either destroy the invaders or overpower the base

**Bear cavalry** - force them to use removal on you, then shunt all their minions into a High Ground or use superior power to smash the bases.

**Steampunks** - returning minions to your hand is kind of irrelevant because the power is built onto the base itself

**Zombies** - build up a presence everywhere and bust all the bases at the same time. 

I think aliens definitely have an advantage against pirates because pirates lack deployment, but the threat of a powderkeg should keep some pressure on. 

**Wizards** and **Time Travelers** are support factions, so they don't really have answers, but if you play them together you can swarm the base and they won't want to return anything to your hand because it'll make it worse. 

I just got Obligatory Cthulhu today, so I could probably come up with counters if anyone needs them.

tl,dr:
Exploit the aliens' weakness of no permanent removal and lack of base deployment.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Actually, schools are required to handle claims of rape *in addition to* (i.e. not *instead of*) the regular judicial process. Whether or not a rape victim wants to press charges or report to the police is the victim's decision. Some people choose not to, for a variety of reasons. Why is it necessary to make colleges mandatory reporters for rape and assault when ER medical staff are not? If the police (and the public) wants to know, colleges are [required to maintain a public log of all reported crimes by the Clery Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clery_Act). 

College students are bound by the law as well as by student conduct policies. For example, cheating on an exam is not illegal, but the college has the right to punish cheaters. This may include a higher standard of behavior than local law. For example, smoking may be legal, but the college can sanction students caught smoking on campus, where it is not allowed. Punishment from the school is handled by some sort of judicial community, and the standard of evidence is set forth by the school. The student can sue, but if the school applied the policy (e.g. length of time to prepare defense, hearing, yes/no legal representative, etc.) consistently (e.g. not a witch hunt, discrimination, etc.) and the process is fair, the student doesn't have much legal ground. 

The problem with rape and sexual assault cases is that some colleges have gone out of their way to make the process unfair. Colleges have a conflict of interest here because rapes and assaults (and other crimes) damage the colleges' reputations. Some things that have happened in the past to provoke the Clery Act, the Dear Colleague letter, and this bill are:

* If an athlete is accused and the athlete's coach is involved on the judiciary committee, there is an obvious conflict of interest. 

* Schools deliberately failing to notify students of a crime AND in fact contradicting the findings of the police (e.g. police ruling homicide, school denies it was a homicide; or an administrator received a report of a crime and then did not pursue it or make the report public) 

* Punishing victims who (obviously they have to give some sort of statement of what happened) admit to breaking some aspect of campus policy (e.g. underage drinking). This goes back to the uniform application of student conduct policies, because it is unfair for the college to apply the policy more consistently on the subset of students who report a crime vs. the students who don't.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","With Boots of Magi + Spear of Magus, Nu Wa hits anyone with less then 156 protections for true damage after her soldiers charge.

3 Soldiers hit for 180 total, then you throw in  290 base for Shining Metal with 50% scaling. 470 + 50% so far, but then you detonate a soldier so you get an additional 200+ 50% to 670 + 100%... You can potentially detonate all 3, to 1070 + 200%. A fair amount of it will be true damage due there being what 4 hits in there that apply Magus passive? 

Granted I dont think detonating all 3 in combat will be very practical. There is Fog damage and her ult to account for though. Imo Magus would be core on her just because you know you're getting true damage on probably 4/5 enemy gods with it. I mean Hercules at level 20 with Urchin and Shifters would still take true damage from you at 148 protections. Assuming most of your opposition doesn't get bulkier then this yeah 80% of an enemy team can be hit for true or near true damage.
That's possibly why her scalings are low (other then a global ult dealing high damage would be BS).

Obsidian Shard should be better for her Ult (as with its wind up I doubt you'll get your Soldiers protection shred) and Magus better for everything else.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","At the edge of the city lies a junkyard and every heap looks the same. Busted electronics. Green and brown piles of sludge. Greased carparts, faded plastics, and worst of all, the decaying bodies. Mangy dogs that snuck in through gaps in the fence, cats that sought a quiet place to die, birds with beaks caught in cola rings, every soul nearly hidden among the debris. 

This wretched scene is new. The junkyard used to have a name. It used to be a haven, though it must be said, not in the way of traipsing carnivals or roller rinks. It was a haven of order. Passersby could spot the microwaves grouped in neat stacks, lounge in the aptly titled Couch Corner. Sparrows used to line the wires, taking turns to pick strings and bobbles from the Blue Group. The lumber pile helped to warm weary bones on frigid nights. The mulch pile was turned twice a week, grass clipping patterns raked around its edge. Every area, separate and whole, was posted with a sign. Careful script announced: ""Take what you need. Treasure is relative."" 

Away from the furnishings and trinkets, away from the tattered and folded clothes, a cordoned area holds a short row of graves. Before, it was rare to find an animal's body. The fences were still mended, the grounds were patrolled, but still there were, will always be, persistent creatures.  

Animals who once had burrowed in and left this world alone now lay side by side. Collected, cleaned, and boxed, they rested beneath simple markers. They had been gifted stones. Sprouts and trees, each in its own stage of growth, sprang from the mounds of dirt.

But the rest of the yard has lost order. So, too, does one grave disrupt the line. It is unmarked, uncovered, and larger than the rest. No one has mounded its dirt. No one has planted a tree at its head. Its resident is weathered by the elements. Its hole is unfilled.

At the edge of the city lies a junkyard and every heap looks the same.

The largest Muslim world demonstrations have gone on in Turkey..surprise surprise, they are the big benefactors of Hamas. At the end of the day the plan is for Abbas to be put in charge of Gaza again, aid relief will flow in, and Netanyahu will come out of this with large internal Israeli political capital that will get him the OPPORTUNITY to strike a peace deal with Abbas and the rest of Fatah where he can risk losing the far right nutjob Israeli political parties to strike a final peace deal with the Palestinians.

"MTGLegacy","t5_2x2p0","I would rather keep it Blue White, it makes B2B better.

As for B2B vs Blood moon

1. We get to keep our shuffle effects open which is reasonably important.

2. It cuts off mana that much more since the vast majority of decks don't run any basics or very few. In a situation where they have their basics, Back to Basics is actually better because they don't get basically colorless mana from their non basics. 

3. I'm not forced into a red splash and already in the base colors of the deck.

I thought about leyline and it just doesn't seem necessary given I have the RIP/Field combo there already. Sure it doesn't stop tendrils, but I think I'm reasonable against storm.

Keranos seems better with my humility gameplan since he will never be turned on. 5 mana just seems a bit steep, I get nervous whenever I tap 4 mana to play Jace. This would force me back on the red splash though.

I do have the volcanics needed to make the splash work, I just don't feel it's necessary like it is in Lossett's Miracles.","1406851281"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The issue is not simply one of technology sadly, there are multiple fronts which need to see advancement before we see this kind of game. The big ones I corded are: technology(in console), networking, and audience/ marketability. 

The technology standpoint is one based solely on the console, which is to say you would have to make a a platform that is standardized across the board enough to ensure all the players encounter a similar experience, currently the only system capable of this is the pc, and there are too few with this capability to be worth it. 

Next you would need to have a network capable of supporting all this, and since currently machines capable of supporting this kind of game are so few and far between the networking requirements would me much more strenuous than if a multitude of people had the system allowing for more local networks to be established, such as with consoles. 

And lastly, and I think most importantly is audience. Technically a game like this could be made in the near future, the issue is would it be fun? With 2000+ players would the game leave people with a rewarding game experience that draws them back again and again to play, or would it be a lesson in chaos which offers some novelty in the fact that it is so massive, but after that appeal is gone loses its draw.  I think the big thing stopping this from happening is that someone somewhere had to be able to make a profit off of all of this because of all the money that will have to go into the infrastructure of the game.

Next, I read about them. And I saw who was talking about those issues, what they were saying about them and what they were doing about them. Those people were feminists.

I didnt start off thinking to myself that I'm going to write up a pro/con list of feminism. I didn't come to a realization that feminism was correct. It was: what's the issue. Who is talking about it. What are they saying. What are they doing about it. Do I agree with the approach.

You pointedly did not ask that question. But you're also not listening to me. I'm telling you that I need you to answer that question so that I can answer yours. I can't answer your question until you give me specific information, but at least now I understand why. Our interactions with feminism started for completely different reasons.

If you want me to pick a common misinformed gripe of anti-feminists, I can certainly do that. There's some recurring themes both among the manosphere and on that women against feminism blog. But are you actually going to *read*? 

Seriously. The information is out there. Readily available, and one merely has to *ask* or do a search. I find it incredibly frustrating how misinformed people are with all this information at their fingertips. I really don't have much patience for these discussions because 9 times out of 10, anti-feminists are much more comfortable with their misinformation.

I'm extremely skeptical about having a discussion with someone who makes ridiculous claims about feminists not ever backing their viewpoints up.

"Soil","t5_2rzci","&gt; The bacteria die, releasing their nutrients into the plant..

The actual process is a bit more complex than this. The nutrients in the bacteria aren't always in a plant available form as bacteria use high levels of nitrogen in their metabolic processes. However when the bacteria are digested and excreted by a higher order predators it is readily available for uptake by the plants usually in the form of Ammonium (NH4+). Certain minerals are only available to plants through fungal interactions. One fun one is how certain fungi will hunt and trap micro arthropods for their phosphorus which they trade with plants for carbohydrate exudates (basically cake). 

There's also the various relations between C3 and C4 plants and their bacterial and fungal interactions. C3 plants need Nitrate (NO3-) and C4 plants need Ammonium (NH4+). C4 plants don't do well in bacterially dominated soils because the dominant form of available nutrient is Nitrate. Protozoa and Nematodes both release NH4+ and play a large role in the niche construction and succession to more C4 type forest soils. So it depends what you are trying to grow. The ecological niche for high nitrogen bacterially dominated soil is occupied best by weeds (early pioneer disturbance species). Most vegetables and food crops are further along in succession and require more fungal life. Most vegetables, with the notable exception of brassicas, require about 50:50 ratios of bacteria and fungi with good levels of higher order predators. Higher order predators may also be a good general indicator of soil health (for example see Blair, J.M. et al, 1986 Soil invertebrates as indicators of soil quality ) 

In any case a few points.

1. biochar is of no benefit without soil life. if biochar isn't properly inoculated it does basically nothing. most of what biochar is proported to do can be done with soil life and properly made compost and compost extracts. 

2. it has to be very carefully checked for toxins. 80% of the biochar products tested by elaine ingham had high levels of heavy metals and other toxins. ""Many biochars offered at a relatively recent biochar convention were tested for plant-toxic chemicals and most were found to have a variety of toxins present in them. It is critical to regulate the quality of the materials being used in production of biochar to avoid adding toxic materials to the soil.""

3. clay that has been flocculated stays flocculated as it's chemical structure has been fundamentally changed by the calcium in the fungal hyphae. so even if the fungi is wiped out the soil structure is retained until it is tilled or compacted. the rodale trials (in clay soils) showed no benefit to biochar addition.  

3a. Hummic acids- the carbon compounds produced by fungi are extremely stable aggregates that last from 30 to 300 years. Point being you get exactly the same structural properties by promoting the fungal life as you would by biochar; flocculated clay and humic acid aggregates. Moreover these hummic acid structures are how most carbon is sequestered in the soil. This does not happen through bacterial processes (decomposer bacteria in fact are breaking up carbon chains for energy). 

4. there's a lot of hype around biochar. be suspicious. do the microscope work before you believe anything.  

5. most conventional no till is done with heavy herbicide which wipes out pretty much all of the soil life. conventional no till is as bad from a soil ecology perspective as tillage. 

that said proof is in the pudding. show me some soil samples. what's the bacteria to fungal ratio? how many higher order predators are there? what's actually going on in the ecology?","1406851287"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Yeah I was just saying that is the reason, the 70's blakspoloitation films had a primarily black audience and Django unchained was aimed at a generally primarily white one. You can't have the defining feature of the bad guys be the primary demographic that's going to watch the film, unless it's a film aimed at a liberal white audience with a self flagellatory or 'look at how shit we were, but we're cool now' element.  It's like if there was a film set in China  without a good Chinese person some Chinese people would be mad and wouldn't watch the film(like that jaden smith  ~~karate~~ kung fu kid one), same with pretty much all demographics (apart from ones that are just surprised that somebody was in the film). 

Bollywood films set in England generally are about Indian people doing stuff there, where the antagonists are English, but if they are trying for a crossover hit with a more general audience things will be different.  I think this is also that people against slavery and agitating for it's end weren't all black.

Yeah, you shouldn't ring on other peoples' tills, but it happens. The fact of the matter is that Sick Person's till will just have a ton of money. In the end, as long as the deposit evens out, everything is fine.

As far as tens go, when I worked at a busier store, they were a luxury rarely afforded to anyone. We simply didn't have time to let someone off the floor. I now work at a slower store where tens are a regular thing and I can see how it definitely makes a difference in peoples' performance and temperament, especially if it's a long shift (7 - 8 hours), but unfortunately, even then, sometimes people don't get their tens if we as shifts can't responsibly give it to a person. If I send my store support on a ten with no one to take their place and we are busy, we'll probably run out of mocha, Frap roast, cups, lids, and ice all at the same time. Then the store support person will spend 20 minutes trying to catch back up. It's shitty on both ends.

That being said, acclimating to a new store with new partners can be tough. You may want to talk to your fellow partners or even your store manager about how they run things, as every store has certain quirks or ways of doing things specific to that store. Especially if this store has a lot of older/experienced baristas, they may be slow to accept newer partners and have less patience when it comes to people they think aren't up to their par for whatever area. One of our newer partners is almost always on front or store support, and today, she worked a long morning shift (6 - 2) and had been store support pretty much the entire shift; I gave her some DT time the other day and bar time today when I could. Sometimes it's hard to step away and realize that people won't get better without practice.

If you're really concerned, ask your shifts or baristas if you have room for improvement somewhere, or if there is something you could be doing differently. You shouldn't dread facing your coworkers!","1406851289"

You cannot compare Syria's chemical weapons to Hamas' resistance. Plus, there is no way Hamas would stop the fighting until Israel agrees to their international obligations.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","In my scenarios, the teacher never has sovereignty over the playground. She helps the child achieve a state of sovereignty, sure, but she never stakes a claim on the land for herself. (We could extrapolate this out, but then we move into the issue of teacher vs. school vs. town board vs. state board vs. federal board and so on. It creates more of a mess than anything else.) If the teacher stops backing him within the confines I've set, then, the jungle gym naturally falls back to the next group with the best means to control it (and, of course, the will and intent to control it). The child, as I've said, is the party with sovereignty in that he has control of the jungle gym, but as the sovereignty is demonstratively dependent upon the teacher's support, it is not, by definition, sovereignty as we think of it--that is, an independent power. It is a shadow sovereignty, the photocopy I described.

With regard to your comments on my fourth scenario: the potential of the coalition to revoke the adversarial boy's sovereignty is not, itself, a claim to the jungle gym; I completely agree with you. Just because they *could* take control of the jungle gym from him doesn't mean they *have* taken control away from him. I didn't mean to imply otherwise. What I was suggesting was that the coalition's potential highlights a destabilization within the boy's sovereignty that, by definition, revokes his claim to absolute sovereignty. The boy still controls the jungle gym, that much is true, but he then controls it due to the inaction of the coalition and *not* through his own means. Sovereignty is conditionally dependent on control, but you can control something without being sovereign; in this case, the boy controls the jungle gym even though he cannot reasonably maintain his power through his own means if it is challenged. It is through the teacher's grace that the boy maintains power, thus bringing us back to the shadow sovereignty from the first paragraph.","1406851289"

Many people will accept ancient stories as factually true because they were either raised to believe they're true or because it feels good to believe they're true.

I don't care how good an ancient story makes me feel. If it is not convincingly proven to be factually true, I don't accept it as true. For example, I was raised to believe the christian religion's claims concerning an invisible intangible intelligent entity and life after death are factually true, but having looked for evidence I can't find any, so I reject the christian religion's claims.

This seems like basic common sense to me, but then I look around and realize that it isn't really very common to think this way at all.","1406851294"

"toronto","t5_2qi63","While I certainly don't like Ford, as a person or a candidate, I do admit a fascination with his popularity and I think there's something we can learn from it.

I mean, look at how he relates to his base; all of those door knocks and phone calls actually reach people, and then once word of mouth creates the reputation of a politician who gives personal attention the meme perpetuates itself.

I've been in the same neighbourhood for eight years, and I can tell you, I've never had my local representative show up at my door (not that I particularly want them to... but you see what I'm getting at).

There's also his candid nature, which I'm convinced is the accidental result of his low intelligence, but is incredibly effective regardless. In the political sphere you almost never hear a single word that isn't a polished, insincere half-truth that patronizes or lies to people (remember when the young Trudeau swore in Parliament? I almost cheered!), which would make anyone learn to mistrust and hate them.

And finally, there's his decisiveness and commitment; now, obviously he hasn't followed through and I didn't care for his promises, but the average politician rarely commits to anything concrete. It's always weasel words, half promises, conditional phrases and vague messages to avoid being tied down to any one position they may have to take responsibility for - that or just empty platitudes. Every politician says they're for better transit , but Ford promised a specific subway on a specific street and didn't waver from that.

The system you propose is one in which a man has sex and all he has to do to avoid consequences is sign a piece of paper.  Meanwhile, a woman has sex, and if she wants to avoid decades of obligation she has to instruments inserted into her vagina, have her cervix dilated, the contents of her uterus vacuumed out, bleed unpredictably for several days, wild hormonal swings, hormone-driven emotional swings associated with the end of pregnancy, etc.  

There is a certain philosophical attractiveness in giving men an 'out' because women have one.  However, the real world manifestation of that system are far messier.

It takes some serious mental gymnastics to setup Muhammad as anything other than an ego maniacal warlord.

He hijacked some pre-existing religions, then made himself the sole mouth piece of his new religion.

He murdered, he assassinated, he lied, he played loose and fast with his own dogma and made shit up as he went along revising it as he needed. And once he was in a position of power, he then recanted the only good parts of the religion he'd stolen from.

&gt; Nah.

Just because your delusion is they came from a ""god"" doesn't make it so. Since it requires special pleading and some vicious blows to the head to believe your particular religion is correct, the default position is they are man made. first part.
Second part, is evidenced by the fact that Muslims are neither better nor particularly worse than any other group. (Those that live in western countries seem to be better than those that don't as measured by their polls on their positions of human rights.)
&gt; Are we talking about cultures now or a person's ego? Make up your mind.

Sorry, do I need to slow the pace for you to keep up?
Culture is the realm of man made behaviors and traditions that flavor a particular social structure. (oh boy I know we're going to have fun with this one)

Followers of Muhammad's ego have created a ""culture"", ""cult"", ""society"" around not just his ideas but several centuries of primitive desert traditions that over the centuries have evolved to their current state and expression.

The only MR on the entire other team is merc treads on Voli. The Vlad ult hit the entire enemy team, and Amumu's ult was layered on *after* it.

* I recommend trying Planeside 2 again, the recent patches have really brought the game forward into something fun, just make sure you join an outfit (clan/guild) so you can get some help with the game and team play really makes the game much more enjoyable.
* I personally don’t care for Neverwinter, but it does have a dungeon editor so you can play a new dungeon whenever you want or design them.

Its clear that we share a common ancestor, but its easier to put bumper stickers ridiculing scientists for thinking we came from them. I know far less than I dont know, meaning I am as ignorant as most, but the difference is I try to do something about it, which is why I appreciate Cosmos, both new and old versions. If you are one who wonders why there are still monkeys, then that's clearly a result of you never having properly been explained the process of evolution.Edit: And I'm sorry, but it is obvious that our culture is light on science education, of that there can be no debate. As a result, we as a people are overwhelmingly ignorant. Its not an insult ,and I apply that tk myskef in many situations as well.

"floridakeys","t5_2shrz","The problem with not relying on the bar scene is there isn't really much else to do down here.  You might be able to meet some cool people by introducing yourself at the beach (Marathon has Sombrero, which is a great free beach, but I don't know how busy it is), but a lot of the people you meet are going to be from out of town or want to be left alone.  

If you don't mind the bar scene, one of m favorite places is about half an hour north of you.  In Islamorada at the Safari Lounge, we have an open mic/jam night every Tuesday starting about 730 - whenever.  I'll admit it's kind of an older crowd, but you have a bunch of really great locals and a smattering of generally good tourists hanging out, plus free live music and sometimes free food.  It's at mile marker 74 on the ocean side. 

I know it's a bit of a drive, but pretty much everything in the Keys is a bit of a drive, you'll get used to it.  Some of our musicians come from as far away as Marathon and Key Largo (I lived in Key Largo for 6 months and made the drive down every week to play, now I live a lot closer).  

If you do happen to be a musician, we'd be more than happy to have you join us, or you can just have a drink and enjoy the evening.  If there weren't people to listen to us every week, we would have stopped a long time ago :)  The music is mostly oldies: classic rock, blues, old country, with some contemporary stuff thrown in.  

Another idea for meeting new people is volunteering.  One of the neat things about the Keys is that considering how small it is, it has a ton of active volunteer groups.  A good way to meet younger people is to maybe look into volunteering at places like the dolphin research center or other sea life rehabilitation places.  Lots of young twenty somethings that like to work with animals and enjoy life in the Keys.  There are lots of volunteer groups for land-based stuff, too!","1406851303"

"ModernMagic","t5_2xs5t","I really like this idea. I just finished reading the Modern Hero article. I can get the modern event deck for $50 from amazon, and start saving from there. This way, I can still mix it up in my local modern scene with an interactive deck from the get-go.

As you mentioned, rushing the Thought Seizes sounds like the way to go from there, since they can fit it many decks. I have been reading about the BGw version of Rock, and it sounds right up my alley. I like the idea of slowly grinding card advantage, and having the best removal at my fingertips. And if I decide I hate the GBx archetype, the cards I will be getting are good in other decks as well.


Do you think pack rats would be a good choice for a B/W token deck? I have one laying around and I could get a few more very cheap.

I don't mind saving up for the big stuff like LotV, Goyf, and Bob, but I will wait on getting LotV just in case she does get reprinted. Also, is it worth it waiting on getting fetches just in case they do get reprinted?

Why would I want  Dorans and Spellskites as an intermediate step towards Goyf? And at what point would it be worth it it to start mixing in green and taking out white cards as I am transitioning from Tokens to a Rock archetype?

Head on over to www.thirdgen.org if you havent already been over there.  Best forum hands down for third gen camaros.  Tons and tons of information on everything about these cars.

I'm sure your dog lived a great 8 years after his diagnosis. As I am sure that the medication was costly to keep him alive. And while 10 years is a long time for a lab it is still below average life expectancy for the breed, and you gotta wonder what kind of side effects those drugs were giving him. You can believe that the medicine he was on will be replaced one day. one day. more and more, each day, by many actually. Either way I have documents, xrays, tests, and so on about my dog's case, including his epilepsy. You'll have a chance to read that soon, but only if you choose to learn everything before calling something really important ridiculous. Remember: you fund your own life, trust yourself.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","Ah, dot product is high school level maths, proper application of dot product is further maths, applying dot product to a physical system is higher level uni stuff, which makes sense because game development is a career, it's supposed to be higher level than school. I would compare game logic to my uni courses, not school courses.

I wrote a [gama blog](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlexRose/20140711/220882/2D_Physics_Analytically_Targeted_Rigidbody_Projectiles.php) showing a possible solution to that problem a couple of weeks ago, my natural instinct was to use classical mechanics.

I'm inclined to think that you're underestimating the problem, but if you aren't and I've gone about it a convoluted way I'd be very interested to see the basic solution to the problem. (I did the working to my solution a bit more in depth [here](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlexRose/20140711/220882/2D_Physics_Analytically_Targeted_Rigidbody_Projectiles.php#comment246200)). Predicting an angle is a very different task to predicting a velocity, which is trivial, since you end up with 2 solutions, of which either could be a turning point or imaginary solution.

But, I mean, I'm sure I could come up with a lot of examples where it seems like it'd be something completely trivial if you know maths and ""where do i start"" if you don't. Like, say you're using the function:

pos += (desiredpos-pos)*k, where k is what fraction of the way you want to get closer to your desiredpos in one frame, say you needed to do this through forces, how would you get the position in terms of a force if you weren't familiar with maths? That's one I use very frequently, and for torques.

Or say you want a background to pulse through some colours regularly, or.. I mean, I'm trying to come up with general questions, but most of the things I do are specific examples of things I can visualise in my head, then I write down the maths for exactly what I want, then I code it and I end up with an uncompromised version of what I imagined. I can't imagine doing that without the maths step, but I can't imagine picking that up as I went along, because you need that maths to start doing the fundamentals.","1406851312"

Your body is going through alcohol withdrawal.  There will be disruptions.  Not being able to sleep is one of the expected disruptions.  Count on it, and plan for it.

If you're not tired, don't go to bed.  If you are tired but can't fall asleep, rest.  Or get up and do something else.  So you'll be tired the next day.  1) Big deal, and 2) What other choice do you have?

"DungeonsAndDragons","t5_2qwdo","I'm a big believer in not being a dick. This guy was a dick, there is no doubt about that, but I think this goes beyond just dnd's culture. 

Men are still looked down upon and cast out for not acting in a masculine way in our society. As a man along with my fellow men I've been told all my life that my feelings don't matter, suck it up pussy kinda thing. My family has a running history of depression issues and I've mostly grown out of them since turning twenty, but I can still recall being told to ""suck it up, faggot."" 

Its no secret that nerds and geeks tend to be on the sensitive introverted side. Being picked on leads to being aggressive and angry, and being told you're a failure as a man is really accepted in our society when someone isn't overtly manly. I feel for the DM in this situation that was rejected by Lucy, all guys know that feeling it sucks, and I know exactly his mindset after it happened. It was probably petty revenge, which he had no right to carry out. Really though, I wouldn't want to be around someone after they rejected me, no one does and he was in a situation where as a DM he was forced to interact with her. Even then he really should have kept his sex kinks to himself. 

You really want this to stop? Society need men to be able to take on more feminine traits without fear of respite or rejection from society. Geek culture has long been a respite for males to take out their pent up aggression in against people, society, whatever for a while. Women have every right to participate in geek culture as well. But if you really want the chauvinistic neckbeard sterotype to go away, everyone needs to feel like they matter, that they have worth as a human being in society not just at the gaming table.

I'm assuming the four short statements are your measure of personality?  Why not use official scales based on the Big Five if you really are looking for a relation? Or is there a specific reason why you used them? If so, by all means, I apologize.

You have at NO time talked about or even more importantly given consideration to the victims, the dead, their families. Why not? Why do you care about this disgusting creature and not the hundreds if indeed thousands of people deeply hurt and affected by all this?

I think it is because you do not want to consider the relationship - the obligation of the murderer to his victims and those he has affected. 

You would rather assert some Nordic fantasy of moral superiority giving the murderer a stupid toy as this is representative for you of some better, more informed method of rehabilitation than considering rehabilitation as an area where the murderer must understand his crimes, his disgusting reasoning, his effect on those people, his complete disregard for the norms of his society and so on.

When you grow up and give consideration to the victims before the person who caused this pain and suffering then you may be considered as showing some maturity. Until you achieve this you appear to me as an immature, ranting child who cannot see the wood for the trees.","1406851329"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt;""What is the Definition of Gender?"" Well, if there is no singular Trans Narrative, then there is no singular Trans Gender. 

And that isn't cognitive dissonance? People identifying as something that they won't define, and call other people hateful for attempting to define, and yet expect other people to participate with this inexplicable concept and follow rigid rules in order for them to express this undefinable identity. 

&gt;I've seen Gender Defined a dozen different ways by a dozen different people, both inside and outside of their communities, and how it's used makes sense for what narrative that community uses it for.

What you're describing is a lifestyle. 

&gt; Gender is actually a Physiological Thing, it affects the Brain's structure and how that brain observes its own sex.

""Brain sex"" is an unproven concept and certainly has no scientific consensus. Not that there haven't been people with a vested interest in demonstrating men and women have different brain structures and simply cannot think alike over the centuries. 

&gt;science has found more evidence that coincides with this theory.

Actually neuroscience continues to discover evidence that the brain is ""plastic"", meaning the brain can be *physically* altered by mental processes including trauma, psychology and skill development.

&gt;The solution to the Gender Problem in this community is to transition their physical sex to one more desirable. This group actually tends to despise Gender Roles,

Except that thinking one must change one's *sex* in order to be congruent with their *gender* is a wholehearted support of gender roles. If your gender is ""woman"" then you have to allegedly change your sex to female. What does that mean? What does ""woman"" entail that requires a sex change? What *is* the ""woman gender"" that only females can apparently embody it? 

&gt;this group reviles traditional gender roles

Except the part where being ""non-binary"" implies there's a binary system to begin with. Even if they revile those roles they're still painting them as an innate standard. 

&gt;Neither of these groups want to be told what Gender is

In all this text wall you *still* haven't defined what gender even is. Can you not even give a succinct definition? 

&gt;If there is anything innate and immutable about a person's sex, it isn't their body.

Pretty sure the scientific community isn't with you on this one. Humans are a sexually dimorphic species. We reproduce sexually, thus we have male and female sexes. These are two different phenotypes with two different karyotrypes. Differing bodily structure, DNA, and chromosomes. Females cannot receive organ transplants from males, no amount of plastic surgery or artificially increased testosterone will change that. Males have prostates an are at risk of cancer of the prostate, no amount of plastic surgery or artificially increased estrogen is going to change that. 

And that's just scratching the surface off the top of my head. 

That the sexes differ isn't a *bad* thing, however. What's a bad thing is that human culture and society has developed to treat each sex very differently in largely arbitrary ways. It causes some people to feel uncomfortable with their assigned role, even to the point of psychological distress. Unfortunately, some people feel then they need to do the physically impossible and change their sex in order to escape their assigned role or engage in the things that are enforced as only appropriate for the opposite sex's role. That's the way I see it. 

&gt;You seem to be saying that any woman that acts like Laverne Cox is ""seem to consider an expression of womanhood nearly the same thing as a drag act."" What does that mean? That expression of femininity cannot possibly come from interest in it, as it's an artificial construct worthy of being called an 'act?' 

It means that Cox has a sexist understanding of women. 

&gt;Right, and building a system where a person's sex status (IE GENDER ROLE) were irrelevant would stop this?

Someone's *sex* matters in a number of scenarios. How is what sex someone *is* the same as a gender role assigned to them by society due to their being that sex?

"Seireitei","t5_2w82b","Oh? So he'd hit a nerve in commenting on this Reaper's twisted reiatsu and breath. Interesting, but not nearly enough to have him turn from his goal to 'talk' to this scum. He may have pitied the hollow souls within him, but there was no way to free them once a 'Hollow-Reaper' had been created. He'd seen it enough times to know they had no hope of becoming a true hollow again once forced into the chains of a Reaper. It was quite a sad fate really. There couldn't be a worse torture for a Hollow of any kind than to be bent to a Shinigami's will, and forced into a prison of reiatsu and fear.

""Do not lie to me, worm. You subjugate those Hollow hollow souls, and mask them within your reiatsu. We can only hope they gain freedom someday."" He said without bothering to look back at the captain, only paying him heed at all for the Hollow he harbored within him. ""Although if I'm not mistaken, I am the sane one here, am I not, Captain? Perhaps it is you these people should fear."" He commented, turning his head over his shoulder for a second to see if his words had sparked any reaction from the Captain. He wouldn't activly attack this one himself, but who could blame him for fighting back if he was attacked by a feral Hollow. The chance to kill a Shinigami and free a few Hollows would only be a consolation prize in that case.

Right now, zerker is the most optimal gear (if the whole party runs it) because you'll complete content faster and the overall party damage ends up being a very effective defense. However, in any sort of mixed environment, this typically breaks down, and you can run whatever you like to do pretty much any content the game has. There are plenty of videos of people doing the hardest content wearing no armor. There are plenty of people who run zerk for no reason other than ""OMG HUGE NUMBERS!"" and can't dodge and can't read animations and spend the whole time dead.

 [**Ex-Cubs Factor**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex-Cubs%20Factor): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;The __Ex-Cubs Factor__ (or Ex-Cub Factor) is a seemingly [spurious correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_correlation) that is essentially a corollary to the [Curse of the Billy Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat). Widely published in the 1990s, the hypothesis asserts that since the last appearance by the [Chicago Cubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs) in the [1945 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945_World_Series), any [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball) team headed into the World Series with three or more former Cubs on its roster has ""a critical mass of Cubness"" and a strong likelihood of failure.

The conviction was based on a plea agreement that was signed off on the day before they were supposed to start a trial. I had talked to the public defender about why the hearsay was permissible, and he said it wasn't actually hearsay and is permissible as evidence. The exact thing that happened was Sam found something, the next day brought it up to John and said it is Alex's (the one who was later arrested), and John asked for the item. Later that day John called the police telling them the story, yet Sam was never even questioned or asked about the item by the police. The cops told Alex after he had asked for a lawyer ""well, if you do want a lawyer, you're going to jail, but you can keep talking to us and we can get this all sorted out and get you out of here."" Obviously cops are allowed to lie during interrogation, which isn't a question at all. But the public defender said that despite the fact that Alex asked for a lawyer, since he decided to keep talking once the cops told him what they did, then it no longer matters and whatever he said is permissible.","1406851340"

&gt;**The Final Judgment**  
[**31**] “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. [**32**] Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. [**33**] And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. [**34**] Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. [**35**] For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, [**36**] I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ [**37**] Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? [**38**] And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? [**39**] And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ [**40**] And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ [**41**] “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. [**42**] For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, [**43**] I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ [**44**] Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ [**45**] Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ [**46**] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”

Surviving a heavy attack does not mean a light attack can't hurt you in a meaningful, significant way. I can cite things all day, but all i have seen you cite is ""Basic logic"" ""Common sense"" and ""Being damn sure""


None of that compares to what kratos has been through. Has someone survived terminal velocity, got up and kept on fighting? Over and over again? No. Their body would be paste. You have not cited anything that proves spiderman can hurt kratos substantially, either. Just your own ""common sense""  



&gt;Good, at least we have this as common ground. Now we have to figure out how long eventually is. i think it is sooner rather than later, and you think it is later rather than sooner. My sources are the fact that it doesn't take more than 20-50 hits from anything in the game to take down Kratos, but you don't like my citing gameplay. Since you consider boss fights to be cannon, could i use the Battle of the Last Spartan to approximate Spidermans minimum damage?

The last spartan is one of the weakest enemies that kratos has faced. It would be egregious representation of his durability.


&gt;Again, i disagree with separating damage types without a reason. And your only reason is to try to discount my cannon sources. there is no other evidence to suport this theory.


No my reason is because some characters have shown more resistance to some attack types than others. Like kratos or Luffy


&gt;In this instance it does not specify that is is gameplay only, and it is mentioned right along with lore and history. It is not being represented as being only gameplay. There are specific pages where it talks about gameplay, but this isn't one of them. This page specifically is about the warriors of Rhodes, their history and their abilities.



What are you basing that statement on? I can show you how the even described took place during gameplay. It does not state specifically but the game itself shows that kratos fighting rhodes was gameplay. 



&gt;And your reasoning behind this is the theory that different types of damage would affect Kratos differently, a theory that has no other basis than you want it to be there and if confirms you preconceived ideas.


I have already addressed this. It's the battle with the spartan and the Persian.


&gt;A forest would be even better. Flint and stone are plentiful, Wood is plentiful, fire would be easy to make as well as sharp objects (flint was traditionally used for arrowheads). Wood can also be sharpend, though, not as well as stone. The crowded area and forestry would allow Spiderman to hide and attack very easily from the canopy, or behind trees.



You have a very warped view of spiderman if you think he has the time to do all that in the heat of battle.



&gt;Again, i'm not warping the battlefield. I'm telling you that most traditional battlefields allow for the creation of sharp objects and fire, unless we are talking about barren wastelands or desserts or something. limiting Kratos's vulnerabilities to Fire and sharp objects does not save him.



That is exactly what you are doing. You are creating conditions that benefit spiderman.","1406851343"

I've posted a [lot of requests](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/2c9hb5/request_steam_xcom_enemy_unknown/) for this game because I really want it so bad. I saw my brother play it, and I immediately fell in love with the game. I played some of the original XCOM games so I feel that this would be really fun for me.

The last game that I won from a giveaway was the Deadbreed Closed Beta Pack. I'm not going to lie to you, I haven't really been able to play that game. For some reason it keeps crashing whenever I try to play it. Still trying to figure out why tho :(


I have only recently found out about this sub, so I haven't really been able to post many giveaways. But, I still try when I can. 

Anyways I hope that you consider me and I thank you for reading my post :D

"Metal","t5_2qhud","Take a look at [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/281a8o/its_that_time_of_the_month_again_reddit_tries_to/), it's very relevant to your question. 

The question isn't why (80s) Metal had a focus on fantasy. It's why did virtually all (80s) Metal musicians have such a tacky, one-dimensional, predictable and hopelessly boring understanding of the concept of fantasy. 

The top comment in that thread is: 

&gt;Joke with a smart person = intelligent joke

&gt;Unintelligent joke: A guy walks into a bar. He asks the bartender, ""Do you have any helicopter flavored potato chips?"" The bartender shakes his head and says, ""No, we only have plain.""

&gt;Intelligent joke: John von Neumann walks into a bar. He asks the bartender, ""Do you have any helicopter flavored potato chips?"" The bartender shakes his head and says, ""No, we only have plain.""

In the (80s) Metal musicians mind:

Boring, plain lyrics: 

&gt;Four people in Serbia have been killed by floods

&gt;The authorities have been unhelpful 

&gt;A sad repeat of events of last year's floods

&gt;Romania's Prime Minister sent his condolences  

**CREATIVE AND BRUTAL LYRICS:**

&gt;~~Four~~ **forty million** people in ~~Serbia~~ **the whole world** have been killed by floods **of black bile oozing from the Beast's cloaca**

&gt;The **evil** authorities **of the subjugating oppressor** have been unhelpful **because we are their slaves**

&gt;A ~~sad~~ **pestilential** repeat of **the soul-rending** events of last ~~year's~~ **millennium's** floods **of carnal putrefaction**

&gt;~~Romania's~~ **Hell's**  ~~Prime Minister~~ **First Born** sent his ~~condolences~~ **armies of annihilation**

You don't even have to make sentences, or try to present any ideas, concepts or themes. Just stack spooky words.  

As for the reason, your guess is as good as mine. Was it the coke? The music itself certainly suggest so. Drummers banging like they get a quarter every time a drum stick hits something. Guitar players running up and down the scale for no reason whatsoever. Bass players playing things that have nothing to do with the song. Or maybe it was because most 80s Metal musicians and their fans were white, middle class suburban kids and real life wasn't really a thing they were familiar with at the time? I don't know.

WARNING: SPOILERS FOR REBELLION STORY BELOW

Also, warning: rant ahead.

So, I was a couple months late, but I finally saw PMMM: Rebellion Story. I wasn't a fan of the original series (small minority, I know) but I was pleasantly surprised by Rebellion. 

I liked it, and totally disagree with most of the criticisms of it I've seen.

The most common criticism I've seen is that Homura is OOC, and some people don't seem to understand why she rejected the movie's famous ""false ending.""

I thought that was perfeclty clearly explained in the scene in the flower field with Madoka. I suspect some people saw that scene and went ""sappy scene!"" and fast-forwarded through it.

In that scene, Homura realizes she totally failed at her original goal, which was to protect her friends (and more specifically, Madoka.) Although the world in the original PMMM series was changed to no longer contain witches, that was never Homura's primary goal. Her goal was, again, to protect Madoka and her friends, which she manifestly failed to do. 

Madoka went through all sorts of miserable events, and then sacrified herself to become the law of cycles, even though it's clearly established in the movie this isn't a ""happy"" event for her, and she wished she could have stayed on earth and been with her family.

Homura then falls into despair because she realizes how abjectly she failed to protect Madoka. 

To me, Homura being disatisfied with the way things were made total sense. She wants justice for her friends, and a world where they can live happily. Homura, Madoka, Mami, Kyouko, and Sayaka all still got the short end of the stick in the timeline where Madoka becomes Godoka.

Critics of the movie act like Homura is chaining Madoka up in her basement, instead of giving her a chance at a normal human life. To me, Homura still seems to be acting selflessly for Madoka's benefit.

If the movie had ended at the ""false ending"", it would have given Homura the shallow hapiness of being with Madoka, but would of trampled all over her wish to make Madoka happier.

Finally, I don't understand why anyone thinks the real ending isn't a ""happy ending.""

The way the movie did end seemed like a perfectly happy ending to me, where the law of cycles is preserved (Homura said she only broke off the part containing Madoka's personality), and Homura and friends get to live happily in the Matrix. Justice also gets dealt out to Kyuubey.

Why is not a happy ending? Because Madoka, Sayaka, Kyouko, and Mami had to get brainwashed? Well, too bad. They're going to be happy and they're going to like it, gosh darn it. :P

Now, there were a few things I didn't like.

The ""creepy children's music plays over a surreal scene"" is a cringe-worthy cliche, and Rebellion has no less than *three* of these scenes. The first one worked, the second one was pushing it, and the third one made me want to groan. 

Also, the scene with Hitomi was pointless and dragged on forever. Considering the movie's runtime it a full two hours, they hardly needed the padding.

Still, a good movie. I would definitely recommend it if you never saw it.","1406851354"

I would look at taking Computer Engineering as well as it will give you a bit more of a technical approach to computing and electronics.  You can still take essentially all CSE classes besides the required ECE classes which give you a background into the hardware.  Also your Senior Design class ECE 480 will be paired with Electrical Engineers and you'll be able to design a robotics or electronic control system which end up being pretty fun projects.  I did CPE and I would imagine it might be a bit tougher than CSE and both will give great job opportunities, one just focuses more towards electronics and one focuses more towards computer software.  

First classes (CSE231/CSE232 and take ECE 201 if you're interested in the hardware side - if it's too hard just stick to CSE)

ECE 331 is basically your major intro to Microprocessors and how they work.  Check out arduino DIY projects as well which can give you a high level understanding of microcontrollers and embedded systems.  And additional check out the magazine MAKE if you really want to see some cool embedded systems projects.  Microprocessers are basically like tiny computers that run software to control analog/digital inputs and outputs along that can control all sorts of things like LED's, motors, sensors, and displays.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; Relevant because I'm routinely frustrated that the MRA movement seems founded on hitching legitimate complaints men have to policies centered on attacking feminism rather than helping men. Then when facing criticism from feminists for their policies, they use that fuel their victim complex and ""prove"" how much we hate men.

I would say this description could apply to some (not all feminists) by switching the genders.  For the record, I don't consider myself a feminist or a MRA.  That may explain why I had never heard of this story before.  Do you deny that there is a hateful, extremist wing of the feminist movement?

What percentage of shelters are mixed-sex?  How many people would you expect him to be able to help with just his house and limited financial support (he had to shut it down due to lack of funds)?

There is documented evidence that some (not all but many) women's shelters are actively hostile to men.  Abuse support lines have been documented as treating any men that call as abusers needing treatment.  I would argue there is strong perception in this country that shelters are not available for men (certainly very little funding for them).  The fact that men don't seek out shelters is taken to mean there is no need for them, but without taking into account all the factors that keep men from seeking out the help.

A culture that enforces macho behavior is (in theory) opposed by feminism.  The message that men are physical oppressors and almost completely responsible for DV, rape, and sexual assault is very much pushed by feminists (back to that hateful extremist thing).  What is needed is an acknowledgment that women aren't harmless flowers and men aren't living stone statues.  Change the message about DV and the distribution of funding, and the demand will be there for men's shelters.

PS how is the comment in question sexist?  Just because the story is often brought up by MRAs and is critical of feminism doesn't mean it is sexist.","1406851356"

"suggestmeabook","t5_31t41","*[House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves) of Leaves* by Mark Z. Danielewski will blow your mind on multiple levels. It's about a documentary film maker who realizes that his new house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside, so he films his explorations. Except it's not really about that, it's about a blind man who discovers the unreleased documentary and writes a dissertation about it. Except it's not really about that, it's about the apprentice tattoo artist who discovers the dissertation after the writer dies, then slowly descends into madness as he reads it.

Add to the multi-level story a multi-level writing style in which typography is just as important as the words themselves. There are footnotes. Sometimes those footnotes have footnotes. Sometimes the footnotes to the footnotes have footnotes. At one point, you're ready five footnotes deep and slowly climbing back up to the main narrative. There are portions that require you to hold the book up to a mirror. There are sections with only a few words per page, so you're flipping through the book as quickly as the characters are running away from... something. And you're never quite sure who's lying, the film maker who lived in the house, the blind man who wrote the dissertation, the punk who's reading it, or none of them. Also, Danielewski is the brother of the singer Poe, who's second album *Haunted* was apparently inspired by the same shared experience that triggered *[House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves) of Leaves*, with definite links between some of her songs and his stories.

And that's possible the most normal of the books he's written. *Only Revolutions* starts out normal enough except that the last line of the first page is upside down. The further you get into the book, the more upside down lines there are. Except you're not supposed to flip the book over each page, because when you get to the last page, there's only one line rightside up. At that point, you flip the book and re-read the story from the other character's perspective. There's also a sidebar on every page that contains historical quotes. In one direction, it runs from 1863 to 1963, in the other direction it runs from 1963 to 2063, meeting on November 22nd, the day of JFK's assassination.

And his novella *The Fifty Year Sword* is a ghost story told by 5 different narrators. Except the only way to tell which narrator is speaking is to note which color of quotation marks surround the paragraph. This is important because you eventually figure out that one of the narrators is a liar.

His next book may begin to appear in print this year. It's called *The Familiar*, a 27 volume story about a 12 year old girl who finds a cat.

If you want something a bit more ""traditional"", I would recommend *When I Was Five I Killed Myself* by Howard Buten. The story is told form the perspective of 8 year old Burt, who writes his tale on the rubber walls of the ""quiet room"" rather than talking to his counselor. When I finished reading it, I stared at the pages in shock for about 15 minutes, trying to comprehend what the fuck I had just read.","1406851358"

As far as commuting goes, almost all my colleagues who live in Ventura(or thereabouts) take the [Vista Coastal Express](http://www.goventura.org/?q=travel-ventura/vista/routes-schedules/routes/vista-coastal-express-northbound-weekday). They rave about it and have laughed in my face when I asked them about the possibility of a train commute. 

For an internship in Oxnard, I would absolutely look into housing in Ventura. There's a decent foodie/brewery scene there, and a few tech meetups that draw folks from all over. I regularly go to shows at the [Majestic Ventura Theater](http://www.venturatheater.net/) and have been to some great bars/eateries around there. 

Commuting to/from Santa Barbara would be beautiful, but I don't think you'd be necessarily missing out on anything in particular, by staying closer to internship HQ.

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","The Bible has words on this as you mention. First, you must be certain you have not had any part in her frigidity. Have you been a *lover* to your wife, or a *user* of her body (Matthew 7:3)?

Before you go to a pastor, remember what the Bible says about confronting your brother or sister in Christ about their sin (Matthew 18:15-17). First confront them one on one, THEN confront them with one or two others (Pastor and his wife for instance). Make certain you do this in love, and do not begin with emotional accusations. 

1 Cor 7:3-5 (Do not deprive your spouse of sex unless it is agreed upon to fast from sex for an **appointed time** by **both parties**. So, both spouses must agree to not have sex, and the amount of time cannot be open ended. It must have an end date.)

1 Cor 10:23 (Everything is permissible, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible, but not everything builds up.)

Read **ALL** of Song of Solomon to see how kindly sex is referred to in the bible. This book alone should very much make the point that it is not evil, and that not only is it permissible, but that it also ""builds up"".

Proverbs 5:15-19 Drink water from your own well—share your love only with your wife. Why spill the water of your springs in public, having sex with just anyone? You should reserve it for yourselves. Don't share it with strangers. Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. She is a loving doe, a graceful deer. Let her breasts satisfy you always. May you always be captivated by her love.

Proverbs 14:1 (The wise woman builds her house, but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down.)

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","He was 9.5 years younger than me, I hope that qualifies. 

He was a good kid, but he was a kid. I started referring to him as a Puppy because that's almost exactly how he was in personality. Like, you bring home a 12 week old puppy, and they're so cute! So excitable about everything! It's all cool! It's all fun! I'll do what you wanna do because you wanna do it!

And then The Puppy does something, like chew your good pair of shoes. Or they pee on the floor. Or they bark too much. And you have to discipline them because you just can't have that sort of behaviour, regardless of the cuteness, and when you DO say something, THEY'RE SO HEARTBROKEN. AND YOU FEEL LIKE CRAP. With so little relationship experience on his end, I felt like I was getting irritated with EVERYTHING he did, and it SO was not fair to him. I wanted to date someone who knew why it wasn't socially acceptable to honk my boobs in the grocery store, or to boo my quips and stories because ""That's not funny. You're not funny."" Oy.

Yeah, I had to stop seeing him. But I kept putting it off because he was going to University, so I was hoping he'd meet someone in his classes - until he didn't. Then he started trying to insert himself into my life. Then I told him we were done. Then he told me he was in love with me and didn't speak to me for a year.

We're better now, friends and he occasionally hints at the benefits, but I wouldn't touch that boy with a ten foot clown pole. In my mind he's still a puppy, and he needs someone else with the patience and level of caring to be that terrible partner we all have that makes us real human beings, capable of love and thinking outside of ourselves.","1406851361"

I'm not asking for Celtic to break the bank, I'm not asking for Celtic to even rock the bank a little, but lets be honest, we've brought in a lot of cash recently.  Yes we did spend money on Pukki, Balde and Derk, and it was overspend on poor to average players.  
My ideal Celtic starting 11 would be 7, or 8 players brought in through the academy or bought at a relatively young age from another SPFL team, and then top that up with 3, or 4 of the best players you can find that are willing and eager to play in Scotland.  Lets stop the scatter gun approach to buying players, instead of buying 4 average players, invest all that cash in one good player.  Let the development squad pick up the slack.

Study kanji.　Learn lots of words.  It helps to learn lots of words that use the same kanji at the same time to really drill in the nuance of that kanji.

For example, when I learned 畏, I also learned many words such as 畏敬 and 天畏, and many others.  However, when I learned 恐れる and 怖れる (which are *much* closer in meaning, I don't even remember their exact differences in nuance), there were no such distinctions or notable terms.  That plus a lot of experience and exposure, and I realize that 畏れる is generally used for things like the Christian god.

Also most decent character dictionaries will mention something about it.","1406851371"

"cincinnati","t5_2qt1k","I've never been to PA but I'd imagine our international cuisine is pretty similar.  If you are looking for world class japanese/thai you are going to be disappointed.  If you are looking for lots of midlevel/cheaper options than they are fairly abundant.  

I don't know how this changes things, but many of the hospitals around here are catholic, which may cause you some issues.  Thats not to say they will be discriminatory, but I would imagine you may have some personal feelings on working for them.  

Northside for a long time was known as being almost a gay communitiy.  Newport where I live, is very gay friendly.  OTR and a few other places close to the city would also be very accepting.  That said, we also have a large percentage of the population in the suburbs that is very conservative.  To give an example the Butler County sheriff (just North of Cincinnati) sent Mexico a bill for illegal immigrants living there the other day.  Just before that he criticized the City of Cincinnati for researching how to make Cincinnati more immigrant friendly and stated he hopes all the immigrants come here and basically get murdered.  That doesn't particularly translate directly to the gay issue, but I think its a good example of the types of folks you may encounter outside of the younger urban core.  

I'd maybe say there are plenty of opportunities here to be accepted and welcomed if you seek them out, that said you will probably face some people who are not accepting.  If you are ok with that, you can find a lot of happyness here.  The city has a lot going for it.  If occasionally finding yourself among less accepting folks is unacceptable to you, then you should consider that, as it will probably also happen here.

I don't mean to make it sound bad, I'm just trying to be honest.  I kind of doubt it is radically different from the rest of the midwest so you may already understand the situation fairly well (unfortunately).

As far as things to do I think there is a lot going on here.

Good Luck!","1406851374"

There's that, and perhaps this is just something that I've developed because of my father, but accepting money from people even if you need it is a slight against your own masculinity....I think? It's a psychological thing. 

When the 2008 market crash occurred, our family got screwed over. We had just bought a house and the market value just dropped like nothing else, and just like that, we were in debt for a LOT of money. My father has friends with connections (business owners etc.) who offered to help us out, but my dad refused to do anything. It was because 

1) He didn't want there to be a financial relationship that complicates a personal relationship
2) It's also proving that he can't support his own family, which is a slight against his ego.

For the second reason, it's obviously being more selfish because you're putting your pride before necessity, but perhaps that's another driving factor? Your boyfriend might have a lot of pride, and he wants to be able to provide for you as well as pay off his debts. Whatever it is, I would suggest you don't take it personally!

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I was talking more about the hair-color point (admittedly tangential), but I'd like to cross-counter by pointing out you used ""woman with blonde hair"" and not ""blonde woman"" originally.  As for making it so wordy, that's a bad habit I picked up from someone who would go off on a, ""if you put the adjective before the person, you're making the adjective to focus, not the person,"" peeve and get annoyed with things like ""disabled people"" vs ""people with disabilities.""  

I only picked on the blonde example because I mostly agree with you on the others. Though it gets tricky when you start considering other factors like ""women,"" excluding ""girls"" but, ""female,"" more often describing sex than gender.  But yeah, ""dudes and females,"" is awkward.  Whenever you're mixing terminologies that belong in different contexts it comes off as having some other implication.  That said, ""number of males and females that are victims of abuse,"" should be fine... but something like ""number of males and chicks that are victims of abuse,"" would be very WTF.  I do agree ""female"" has more of a clinical feel to it, but that's why I think it seems fine in the context of statistics.  

&gt;No one is ever like ""this nice Republican boy held the door open for me today.""  

That's be the adjective form.  Needlessly adding adjectives to people is a pretty big issue on it's own.  It's just a problem that shows up a lot more with things like race because, with gender, the pronouns subtly do the same thing.  For better or worse, ""there was a really nice person behind me in line today,"" is probably a lot less common than ""nice man/woman/guy/lady/boy/girl/etc.""","1406851377"

Higher pressure isn't free.  A diesel engine must be built much thicker/stronger to compensate for the extra compression.  This makes them heavier.  Newer metals and turbos have changed this a bit and a high-tech diesel engine can be lighter than a low-tech petrol engine.  But it'll still be more expensive because it's high-tech.

Petrol engines with spark plugs allow greater flexibility in timing and allow for higher revolutions.  A diesel engine *only* ignites the fuel under pressure and *always* ignites the fuel under pressure.  Spark plugs can fire at any point in the compression cycle.  Lower pressure allows for lighter pistons, which combine with flexible timing to allow higher RPMs.  Turbo diesels are doing some pretty impressive things though, these days.","1406851379"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","That is true to some degree, but only social struggle lead to the new fields of employment in people's lives, actually providing decent employment opportunity, above slave labor in the industrial complex, in the service industry. And now it's the creative/entrepreneur/research area we'll need to struggle for.

Only with social struggle to models akin to basic income can those areas see a rise in capacity to take in more workers. Also I see a chance in the organization model of basic income for those areas, better than having 1 social case worker per 1 Intellectual Property producer.

Furthermore, production of IP is a process that can take a long way to see real world economic returns, there's a lot of risk associated. What's your model to make the area more open for opportunity to the masses.

And thinking about it, it can ONLY be the production of IP that yields any real world gains in productivity. In a world where a good design can create automated procedures for anything between agriculture, industry, service. So that's where the jobs will be. We have to enable the people to take em, be it in self employment.

edit: finished the post c;

edit: also I wouldn't say basic income is only something for decent employment opportunity in IP production, it'd be a great baseline for any sort of free market economy! I mean it is a minimum income floor under which nobody may fall, it does not need a minimum wage, all it needs is a humble amount of redistribution to maintain basic consumption, which in turn leads to economic opportunity for competitors to the established players.

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","Not a lawyer, but let me try and dissect that law:

* steady red arrow indication may not enter the intersection
* unless entering the intersection ... is permitted by other indications shown at the same time
* definition of stopping and location of stopping
* facing a steady red arrow indication may, after stopping proceed:
    *  make a right turn from a one-way or two-way street into a two-way street
    *  left turn from a one-way street or two-way street into a one-way street
    *  unless a sign posted ... prohibits such movement
* don't hit cars or pedestrians


Based on my interpretation of that, at the intersection you're showing it would be illegal to make a left on a red signal indication, arrow or otherwise.  In my example, the turn was valid as it was 'permitted by other indications [the sign]'.  In your example there are no such indications (which I'm taking to mean a signal, sign, or other traffic control device).  ","1406851381"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","FutureAdvisor makes some wacky recommendations sometimes.  It can be helpful to look at, but I definitely would not follow it blindly.

For example, for Kroger 401(k) participants, they put together a portfolio recommendation that is roughly [47% international](https://www.futureadvisor.com/401k/the-kroger-co) which is really high (20-40% is a common recommendation).

The [401(k) fund selection guide is now part of the FAQ/Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds).  Check it out.

P.S. I can't recommend a Fidelity Freedom fund without knowing the rest of your fund choices.  It may or may not be your best choice.  The Fidelity Freedom family includes actively managed funds and somewhat expensive expense ratios.  Sometimes, it's the best choice, but if you have one or two Spartan index funds, you can usually do better building your own portfolio.  Try using the guide.

edit: fixed percentages, IMI is a worldwide fund.

Let me remind you that WSBK teams with brand new liter bikes and budgets way higher than what you're talking about still can barely match the pace of backmarker teams, even in the 800cc motoGP era. Only once was a production race bike faster than the GP bikes, and that was a Ducati in the late 1990's if I remember right.","1406851387"

That Muslim doctor they turned away for being from Saudi Arabia could have been the one that saved your life.

The Dutch have a huge problem with racism especially their right wing politicians. To them it's more about no more dirty maroc turk paki rapist savages and ""saving the white race"" than protecting society from extremism. 

Hell imagine if you were a non-muslim trying to escape from a warzone, nope sorry gotta wait so we can do a thorough background check because you're coming outta Syria and that's one of them Muslim countries.

Now don't get me wrong if the Dutch want less ethnic people because they want to 'preserve' their race then power to them I'm all for cultural preservation, heck I wouldn't marry a non-Arab and I believe everyone has the right to that principal but when running a first world country you shouldn't be impacting some one elses freedoms for your own personal belief.

No. Legally that is not the victim's decision. Schools ... all schools ... have the LEGAL OBLIGATION to report any sexual assault reported to them to the police, regardless of what the child victims desires are.

If school administrators fail in that duty, they themselves can be arrested.

And if school administrators are caught trying to teach kids they don't have to report their rapes to the real police, they're guilty of obstruction of justice, and deserve to be put in prison themselves.

And they will be, once a legitimate Attorney General takes office.

&gt; The situations in which you, fellow white person, were involved were unfortunate and inappropriate, this is true. But to claim that these experiences were ‘reverse racism’ both diminishes and minimalizes the real and actual experiences of PoC who really do encounter racism.

I find their example about a white person's straight hair getting touched by a black person showing how white people whine about minor instances of racism fascinating... but I don't see white people saying they suffer from ""microaggressions."" Their own movement is minimizing racism and oppression to tiny little first world problems that those who are suffering from real oppression would more than likely laugh at, this hair example being one of them.

If being a PoC gives one the ability to make white people ""stop with the derailing and just listen and learn,"" then this PoC is here to make white people learn that idiots who dismiss their opinions based on the color of their skin shouldn't be listened to in the first place. ~*PoC paradox*~","1406851395"
"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","My advice is to try to wait it out this month and a half.

Stay away from drugs and alcohol.

Stay away from partying.

Sleep at least 7-8 hours every night. No more no less. (Sleep when the sun goes down, and wake up when the sun goes up. Don't do all nighters try to stick with the natural rhythm.)

Stay away from caffeine. (Soda and coffee)

And try not to spend money on things you don't need.

Go out and do something fun with or without friends for a moderate amount of time throughout the week.

Don't stress out too much about your mood.

And if something gets a bit hard come straight here to talk about it to find out what the best step would be to take!

I'm looking for DJs &amp; I've had a face to face meeting with the rest of my vendors &amp; this is very important to me. I received this in an email from a DJ company, after asking if we could meet before making a decision: ""We can arrange for you to meet with your DJ traditionally around three weeks prior to your wedding. We don’t have the facilities to meet before making the booking but if you are interested to see how we work you can get a very good idea from our videos"" 

Now I understand that I will likely not be meeting the actual DJ until closer to the date. But is it unreasonable to ask if I could speak with someone to discuss our expectations? I've never encountered a 'no' to meeting before!

There are a lot of different options.  
However quest rewards costing labor to identify, I'm pretty sure anyone who has played a MMO realizes is extremely stupid, I'd also argue coin purses costing labor to open is rather stupid.

&gt;The __Santa Justa Lift__ ([Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language): *Elevador de Santa Justa*, pronounced: [elɨvɐˈdoɾ dɨ ˈsɐ̃tɐ ˈʒuʃtɐ]), also called __Carmo Lift__ ([Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language): *Elevador do Carmo*, [elɨvɐˈdoɾ du ˈkaɾmu]), is an elevator/lift in civil parish of Santa Justa, in the historical city of [Lisbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon), situated at the end of *Rua de Santa Justa*. It connects the lower streets of the [Baixa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baixa) with the higher *Largo do Carmo* (Carmo Square). Since its construction, the Lift has become a tourist attraction for Lisbon as, among the urban lifts in the city, Santa Justa is the only remaining vertical one. Others, including *[Elevador da Glória](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevador_da_Gl%C3%B3ria)* and *Elevador da Lavra*, are [funiculars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funicular), and the other lift constructed around the same time, the [Elevator of São Julião](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Library_Elevator_Coup) has since been demolished.

I find him to be an awesome aura-based support. He brings a little of everything to the table but is primarily tanky. I always play him vs all ad comps just because of the armor passive.

I had kind of dismissed it the first time, since I knew I wouldn't be able to afford the game he was referring to.  But the very day he asked me that second time Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit went on sale.  I pooled together all the resources I had for trade and tried to obtain it, but failed.

That's why I'm here.  I very rarely make requests (in fact, the time I requested this game, I referred to it by an incorrect title), but I at least was able to edit the text in the post.  It failed, however.

"Cubs","t5_2qmnl","I completely agree, but I also place greater value in what a player has done recently. If I'm thinking about signing someone to a 5 year deal this offseason, what he did in 2008-2010 doesn't matter to me as much as what he did in 2012-2014. Three years ago Verlander, Sabathia, and Halladay were three of the best pitchers in baseball. Now, not so much. 

But back to your original question about why people are making such a big about Samardzija. I can't defend anyone who says he's an ace right now, because that simply isn't true. The legitimate reason for excitement is because he's a youngish arm whose performance is trending upwards right before he becomes a free agent. There's a chance you could pay him $100 million over the next 5 years and have him develop into an ace. That would end up being a great deal. Even if his performance stays where it is, $100 million for a #2 isn’t a terrible contract in today’s game. Compare that to the prospect of paying someone like Lester $150 million over 5 years. You need him to stay an ace for 3-5 more years to justify that contract, and you’ll be in trouble if he regresses to a #2 or a #3.

When it comes to the Philadelphia police department, you don't have to worry which ones are bad apples. Hint: They are all.  ""Oh, weed was decriminalized? Naw, we think that ruling was frivolous so we going to keep arresting hundreds.""","1406851411"
"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;You mean the article doesn't say what you claimed it does, liar?

It says exactly what I said it did. That aside, common sense suggests people are arrested when breaking laws.

&gt;You said that people were being arrested for minimum wage violations.  None of your quotes mentioned anything about arrest for anything other than illegal immigration.

I'm sorry you feel that way. Learn to read and comprehend. There is nothing else I can say. 

&gt;I comprehend everything just fine, it's not my fault you're a blatant liar.

I didn't lie about shit. You just don't understand the legal system.

&gt;&gt; No, I said force was used when people do resist arrest.

&gt;Irrelevant if no arrests are being made and no one is resisting.

Right. That's because there's the threat of force, also referred to as coercion. Why is this so hard for you to understand? 

&gt;&gt; Like you understand anything about economics.

&gt;Says the guy who can't even grasp basic words like ""brandish"" or ""arrest.""

Says the child who doesn't understand the context of either.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Circular reasoning.
&gt; 
&gt; You keep saying that. 

&gt;Because you keep using it.

You can't even give me an example of circular logic in anything I've said. 

&gt;&gt;  I'm starting to think you don't even know what circular logic is.

&gt;Circular reasoning is when the conclusion is assume to be true within the premise.

But do you understand it?

&gt;How does a private individual come to own a piece of land?  Don't say, ""By acquiring it legitimately.""  That's circular reasoning.  ""Legitimacy"" is the thing you're trying to prove in your conclusion.  If you assume ""legitimacy"" to be true in your premise, then you've engaged in circular reasoning.

Except you ignore the context of the argument. When I mention legitimacy, I meant in accordance with the NAP and the other moral conditions I had previously mentioned. Your question was not ""what makes owning land legitimate?"", it was ""how does an individual come to own land?"" 

Don't be stupid. 

&gt;&gt; I thought you said you understood the NAP.

&gt;I also understand that the emperor isn''t wearing any clothes.

No. Not even close. If you did, you'd be a libertarian (at the very least).

You believe the state's bullshit. Once again, probably because your a child and still need an authority figure. 

&gt;&gt; My confidence has a basis.

&gt;I know.  ""Unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than is accurate. This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude.""

My skills have been tested and measured. I really am ""all that and a bag of chips."" The only facet of my life that I have not been successful in is the breaking of my ties with the state.

&gt;You're dumb to the point that you can't even use words like ""brandish"" correctly, so no wonder your confidence is so high.

You're inexperienced and naive enough to the point where you've never seen an agent of the state brandish a weapon.

&gt;&gt; I've explained everything clearly and concisely. 

&gt;Says the guy who can't even use the phrase ""brandish"" correctly

That's been your response to nearly everything I've said. If that's all you've got, I'm going to allocate my time to something else.

I am also talking about things such as Remodels of Gods who Hi-Rez is being told to remodel which are Nu Wa and AO by Tencent, there are far older Gods that need to be prioritized based on the community feedback instead they choose not to do them! This is the same with mechanics of the game, changing mechanics won't bring any profits (on paper) whereas skins and remodels will. I mentioned on paper as this is a future investment because making the matchmaking better = more players willing to play and therefore wider playing community. Look at all the comments explaining the negative feedback from league and the comments saying that a certain person won't play league or even Smite because the matchmaking isn't doing it's job.","1406851411"

EDIT Apparently it is very much like WCG with some key people from WCG. http://www.esportsmax.com/news/wcgs-legacy-world-esports-championship-games-launches

I dont think this is anything people should be too excited about, the 2 main entities behind this are Aegis Gaming Network which apparently is just some of the key people and organizers from WCG and the Global Mobile Gaming Confederation. It just doesnt sound too promising.

Why did I suggest dynamic mics? Because they're less sensitive and will pick up less room and background noise. Yes, condensers sound nice but unless you're recording in a sound treated studio (which most podcasters aren't) then dynamic is the way to go. Plus in most cases they add more to the price. They're meant for studio use not bedroom use. You will get all sorts of noise bleeding into the mic, especially with three of them on at the same time.

The fact remains that outwardly people perceive you as white and as such your opportunities and experiences WILL be impacted by this perception. 

&gt;really, all of my accomplishments in life are undeserved, they are entirely a result of privilege I stole from everyone else

Who says they are undeserved? What I'm saying your accomplishments are a result of a combination of circumstances (including obviously your inherent capabilities and motivation) and to recognize those accomplishments as such. I really don't care if you feel that that may not be the case and your success has 100% to do with you, but my experience and the experience of people of color has shown that that's not the case.  Privilege reminds us that white men don't have a predilection for success - the odds are stacked in there favor from the beginning. 

Furthermore, what exactly is wrong with ""diminishing them""? If the reality puts them in a context that more accurately reflects the nature of that accomplishment, deal with it. People of color do NOT have time to deal with your white tears of self-confidence issues.

What you have a gross misunderstanding of privilege, if you think it can be ""stolen"" and THAT is the issue at hand.

To me being self-conscious is more a constant question being asked that needs an answer, and a positive one is necessary for happy times.

First of all, this happened in 1984. Just a mere 30 years ago.

Second, she never claimed the recipes were her creation. She simply submitted them to a cookbook for some type of fundraiser that benefitted Native American tribes. My church used to do the same thing, everyone would pitch-in some recipes, and the church would compile them into a cookbook and put the submitter's name next to the recipe. They'd then sell them for a few bucks and use the money for something charitable. To say these types of cookbooks are unofficial is an understatement. The fact that the right-wing media tried to make hay out of this (in the middle of a campaign obviously) is utterly laughable to anyone outside the conservative bubble. 

So the fact that your only retort involves a not-actually plagiarized RECIPE from 1984 is quite telling, when compared to Rand Paul's political speech that was quite obviously plagiarized and quite obviously presented as his own unique thoughts.","1406851421"

"MH17","t5_32luw","&gt; You are accusing Russia so the burden of proof is on you

I've not accused Russia of anything. In fact, I said specifically we don't know if Russia provided the BUK and crew. 

&gt;there is no hard evidence that Russia gave arms to the separatists

Reuters reported on [compelling evidence that shows exactly that](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/29/us-ukraine-crisis-arms-specialreport-idUSKBN0FY0UA20140729) today. 

&gt;your assumption that the separatists even had Buks is flawed.

As pointed out earlier, the Rebels themselves admitted having operational Buks in response to the July 14th shoot downs bragging they [ 'downed plane from SAM ""9K37M1"" (better known as the ""Book"")'](http://www.vz.ru/news/2014/7/17/696045.html). 

How about the [DNR's own tweet](http://blog.storyful.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/07/Screen-shot-2014-07-19-at-12.56.15-PM.png)?

Multiple images of the Rebel Buk geolocated to Torez   
([Image one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bs2XzV6CIAA3MxQ.jpg:large) is [geolocated here] (https://www.google.com/maps/place/48%C2%B001'28.9%22N+38%C2%B036'56.1%22E/@48.0244266,38.6163938,307m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0?hl=en),

were seen before July 17th.

On July 17th [the AP reported Rebels moving a Buk through Snizhne](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/25/ukraine-buk-missiles-ap-journalists_n_5622111.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular) in the hours before MH17 was downed.

&gt;If you cant prove Buks you have no proof

So given we **can** prove Buks from multiple independent sources?

&gt;for the Snezhne launch there is zero evidence

You're almost right, if by zero you mean 'a lot more than zero'.

All the evidence listed above shows Rebel Buk in and around Snizhne.

There's this [Torez local](https://twitter.com/WowihaY/status/490181213890830336/photo/1) who used eyewitnesses who saw the launch to locate the actual launch site.

Then this guy [who geolocated the picture released by SBU](http://ukraineatwar.blogspot.com/2014/07/launch-location-detected-of-missile.html)

And the journalist who visited the site and [found burn marks consistent with a Buk launch site](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10984530/MH17-the-clues-which-may-lead-to-missile-launch-site.html) according to Russian Military expert Igor Sutyagin.

&gt;it is pure speculation by the Americans

&gt;

&gt;__Deadpool__ (__Wade Winston Wilson__) is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character), a [mercenary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary) and [anti-hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-hero) appearing in [comic books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book) published by [Marvel Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics). Created by artist [Rob Liefeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Liefeld) and writer [Fabian Nicieza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Nicieza), Deadpool first appeared in *[New Mutants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mutants)* #98 (Feb. 1991).

&gt;A disfigured and mentally unstable [mercenary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary), Deadpool originally appeared as a [villain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain) in an issue of *New Mutants*, and later in issues of *[X-Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Force)*. The character has since starred in several ongoing series, and shares titles with other characters such as [Cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_(comics\)). Also known as the ""Merc with a Mouth,"" Deadpool is famous for his talkative nature and his tendency to break the [fourth wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall), which is used by writers to humorous effect.

&gt;He was portrayed by [Ryan Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds) in 2009 film *[X-Men Origins: Wolverine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_Origins:_Wolverine)*.

TLOU had characters that had compounded emotional desires and grew over the entire course of the story. They were real people in that they struggled with the definition of right and wrong instead of just having this assumed altruistic goal.

"StLouis","t5_2qpnm","lol, am I wrong?  there are literally hundreds of similar pieces in galleries and museums all over the country and world. take a [peek](https://www.google.com/search?q=chihuly&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VtTaU9fVE8vpoATNooKYAQ&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1672&amp;bih=1074&amp;dpr=0.9#q=chihuly+chandelier&amp;safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgdii=_). I've seen glass attributed to him in galleries in several states (including SLAM). 

Chihuly is pretty controversial artist. He is the most famous glass artist  in the world and he's been very influential in the art world, but he hasn't actually made a piece of art himself since about 1976.  

He has a successful studio (that is more like a factory) and he hires art students to apprentice and they are paid dirt wages and he puts his name on all their work and it sells for many thousands. They turn out literally thousands of pieces of every year. 

The artists aren't allowed to take credit for their own creations. He's even [sued](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002686721_chihuly16m.html) former employees for copyright infringement because the work they did after his leaving his employment too closely resembled some of the work they did as his employees. So basically Chihuly's ""style"" was developed by his employees, but when they tried to go out on their own he slapped them with lawsuits for it. He's more of a CEO than an artist  and he lied to the city of Seattle in order to get his museum built at the Seattle Center--they promised to have free public exhibits and low admission for residents to get approval from the city council, but then they changed their mind and backtracked but they'd already got the bid so nobody could stop them.

In the Seattle area he is a polarizing figure to be sure, hated as much as loved. Some consider him nothing more than a charlatan, some thing he is a local treasure because he is a local celebrity. ","1406851429"

Sarge grunted. ""Well, I was thinking we could kill you and throw your body over our enemies!"" 

""Oh great."" 

""After doing that, your dead body would infect all those around it with lazytosis! Thus, allowing us to sneak in and get that Epsilon-majiggy."" 

""Um Sarge,"" Simmons coughed. ""That would be impossible. Grifs' body would need to be weeks old for any sort of disease to spread. That and the fact that lazytosis isn't a real disease."" 

""God dammit! Whelp, I guess you get off this time Grif."" Sarge said.

Carolina watched the three bicker, quickly feeling that she made a terrible mistake taking these idiots along. There was no way these sim troopers could be of any help, unless they were cannon fodder, she thought.

""Carolina,"" she turned to face Agent Washington, one of her old teammates from Project Freelancer. ""I'm telling you, they may not be the best, but they're all we have right now. I'd rather you not use them as bait."" 

Carolina stared at him. ""Fine, you can use Grif as bait. Just... don't get them killed. Alright?"" Washington said. 

""Hmph. I still don't get why you insisted on bringing them along."" 

 Tucker and Caboose showed up, Caboose holding his rifle upside down. 

""What?"" Tucker said, shutting off his energy sword. ""The way I remember it is that you and Wash made a deal."" 

Caboose nodded. ""Yeaaaah, I kinda agree with Tucker. The mean lady over there tried to kill us. Something about knowing too much about Church and the Freelancer thingies."" 

""Yeah, and the only reason we're still alive is because Wash convinced you to let us help go and bust Church out of the Epsilon unit or something."" 

Carolina growled. She turned away from the Blues and went to collect the Reds. Truthfully, she wished she could be able to do it alone. As soon as possible she was going to ditch these idiots, or hopefully, they would die during the break out.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Most people who try it don't like it and then unsubscribe. This is actually true of any MMO. Player retention in the genre is not strong. 

This is just my opinion but MMO gamers in particular tend to do this odd thing where they extremely vocally hate any MMO that's not the one they're playing. I'm not sure if all Tekken players hate Street Fighter or not, but I think it's downright bizarre behavior. 

Also MMOs don't really flop. Nearly every single one has a niche (cult) following. I can count the number of MMOs I've seen actually shut down on one hand, but the number that are chugging along with a small but dedicated fanbase probably number in the hundreds. Anyone who has played an MMO before probably already knows this.

What helped me was building a stronger foundation for my lack of belief, I became seriously interested in philosophy of religion and started forming my opinions on all the various arguments for/against God, I found most arguments for/against God weak but it did make me more content in my agnosticism/atheism. I also started looking at all the counter-arguments to the claims of scientific miracles in Islam and then starting looking at some of the incompatibility with Islam and evolution; Islam states that we didn't evolve rather we started out as humans, Muslims love to make this psuedo distinction between micro vs macro evolution which doesn't exist in biology (this is the only real incompatibility I've seen between Islam and science, most other claims about Islam contradicting science seem to be as bullshit/far-fetched/misleading as Muslims who claim Qu'ran has scientific miracles).

PS, your argument doesn't follow. Even if we take the belief that science hardly concurs with religion (they deal in different things, it's like saying science hardly ever concurs with politics), how does it follow that science disproves hell? Science lacks an opinion of hell just like it lacks opinion on most mythological shit . ","1406851436"

At least speaking for most Rocket fans on reddit, we never disliked Jeremy Lin.  We never thought he was even a bad player.  We felt he overlapped too much with James Harden and Bev was a better fit.  But if you read those comments you can see they accuse the Rockets of racism, blatant idiocicy and incomptence for not realizing the pure amazing capabilities of Lin.  Eventually that leads to people going over the top the other way.  He split our fan base by way of his fans.  He brought a lot of people to the game of basketball, and they were very biased in who the real ""best"" player was and constantly looked for scapegoats if he had anything less than unheralded success. 

That is why I feel many Rocket fans were sort of relieved to see him go, not because we did not like him, but having him on the team was a distraction ala having a Manziel or Tebow (in terms of polarization, not comparing actual talent levels, too early to draw a conclusion on Manziel and his is better than Tebow was).

1) They are not trying to dress as a male character they are doing a female version of a male character. Just like doing a steampunk version, or a post-apocalyptic version. It's a fun way to add something new to a favorite character so people at Cons don't see the same thing over and over and get bored. 

2) Men and women's clothing have very different style lines and construction to begin with so as soon as you replace, for example, a mans t-shirt with a women's t-shirt it's already going to be tighter, shorter and most often have a lower neckline. 

3) Everyone likes to show of their best features. For a guy that might mean big shoulder guards to make him look broader or a breastplate designed to make him look like he has a rock hard stomach or a 300 Costume to show off how much he's been working out (I've seen quite a few of these yet I notice they get admired for their dedication to fitness and not chided for being too sexy).
For girls, this might mean showing off her long legs, cleavage courtesy of her handmade corset or tighter pants to show off the butt that doing squats 5 days a week has given her. 

If the costume is an interesting translation of the character and they've obviously put a lot of work into it, I love seeing different versions of characters I love.","1406851439"

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSnapChat).

Masters will be found randomly in the world, and will offer you missions there if you find them. After they move into your hideout, you will get a free mission from them every day, and can still find them out in the world randomly as normal.

This lets people go hard and max out their masters in one long session of grinding, and it also lets people make consistent progress on an otherwise rng-gated chunk of content that might otherwise frustrate them.

That's how I would design it, given what we know. But we don't know much at all about it, so, let's wait and see what the deal is before saying it's the end of the world.

So, you have a dude who wants to get out of the barracks, and the fastest way to do that is to get married, because otherwise you have to wait to get promoted out of there. Then, you have the local women near bases who look for the military guys specifically to marry them and get the check and benefits, and right away there is obviously a recipe for disaster. So, you'll have a dude looking for someone to get him out of the barracks, and a girl who is specifically looking for any military guy to marry. So they'll find each other since there are lots of each one, and they'll do the relationship thing, get married, and it'll go great for a year or two, and then it all starts to go to shit. She starts screwing around on him while he's deployed (or vice versa, or both), shit gets bad in the marriage, and then before you know it the dude is paying alimony to the chick because now they're divorced and 9 times out of 10 there is either actual or claimed physical abuse involved. The whole situation is a load of crap.

I posted an example of personal experience in the other response, but I'll restate it here. I was at a house party once, and there was this girl here who wanted nothing to do with me, until she learned I was AF, then she was practically tearing my pants off. Now, maybe she just had a hell of a fetish for military guys, but from my personal experience, (and a handful of questions asked afterwards) she was one of the ones you have to look out for.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","this is a horrid argument as  the bulk of Poseidon's damage comes from the combo of his whirlpool as well as his tidal meter: 

his tidal meter alone will grant and extra 20% scaling.
plus the 2s knockup will guarantee at the very least 4 ticks of his whirlpool (55 + 15%)
if not the full 6 which brings your grand total to 670+95%

New Wa's on the contrary is not a combo or a bursty ability. has no CC associated and quite frankly doesnt fit the ""new combo mage kit"" hi-rez said they were going for

to be fair the damage of this ult is much more akin to a single agni meteor. (160/195/230/265/300 +60%) with no stun attached and no follow up.

the biggest thing i would also like to point out is the 110second cooldown - which is the longest cooldown in the entire game (exceptions being certain ultimates that have scaling cd's at low levels and kumbha's passive

"androidthemes","t5_2s6h8","I think it would look better if you rebuilt your homescreen from ground up. 

Everything is sort of layered on the screen with no regard to the wallpaper. I think the clock, app icons, music, etc should be placed so they work well with your background. For a good reference check out today's earlier Calvin and Hobbes themed [post.](http://imgur.com/rFiU5kg) Notice how the clock and battery ""blend"" with the wallpaper so neither look out of place. Another good example is [this.](http://i.imgur.com/w2crovj.png) 

I also recommend you create a more cohesive theme. Right now, it looks like you grabbed a random clock widget, a random music widget, and a random Icon pack. Check out our previous [example.](http://i.imgur.com/w2crovj.png) Notice that the icon pack fits well with both the wallpaper and the other widgets. The widgets are all created to have the same font, size etc. This is very important. 

You should learn how to use Zooper. It's great for custom building widgets to fit your screen. If you want, you can also learn Tasker, Popup Widget, and maybe even a little Photoshop but this isn't really necessary to make a nice theme. Installing widgets from the play store is okay, but there is very low chance that you'll find one that meets your needs. IMO, every homescreen needs it's own custom made widgets.

I haven't exactly told you what to do, only spouted some of my random thoughts on android homescreen design philosophy. I think you should just throw down some quick Zooper widgets, and experiment to see what you like. Once you see something you like, make a theme around it! 

Again, this is only my advice, there is no ""right"" way to make a homescreen. ALWAYS make something that YOU like, because you'll be the one using your phone the most. If you want some inspiration, you can just sort this subreddit by top to see what everyone liked: http://www.reddit.com/r/androidthemes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=month

Of course a selfie every now and again if you got a cool accessory or something would be fine too, but literally every single day forcing that same old face (and usually boobs) on my feed.

  Any chance of you organising a hangout night with a group of your work/mutual friends?  Boardgames are great that way.  Cards Against Humanity is a good card game if you know people with a twisted sense of humour and is good interaction.  Though I do remember laughing was uncomfortable for a while, so depending on how far along with her recovery lots of laughter may not be too good.  Trivial Pursuit is mentally stimulating as well and offers the same kind of social aspect.  Plenty of those kinds of games to choose from.  
  
  It's not human interaction, but keep her book intake up as well.  You're laughing if you've got a library nearby, books stopped me from going completely mental (I still went a little mental) and kept my brain from going to mush.

Make sure you are getting intense exercise almost daily to clear out the anger chemicals from your blood. On top of that I've also found it helpful to find a good friend (Mormon or not) that you can speak your mind to that will just listen to you rant for a long time. Also try to explore in conversation what good can come from being lied to. It's a challenge, but I think it gets the mind into a forward momentum mindset so you can eventually focus on other things.  It feels really good to see someone pay attention to your thoughts. Forums like this are good, but in-person is better.

It seems like the two major sub-fields of Computational Sociology are network theory and agent based modeling and as far as I can tell they don't really overlap. I've also seen a lot of text analysis stuff use computational methods, such as natural language processing, machine learning and network theory. 

For the machine learning/network theory/text analysis stuff, you definitely want to check out [Bad Hessian](http://badhessian.org/). As far as I can tell it is the best of the (apparently) very few places blogging about this.

Ketosis is an undesirably high concentration of ketone bodies in the blood and urine. 

Ketoacidosis is a combination of ketosis and acidosis (increased blood acidity) and is associated with severely uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

From what I could find, in the average person ketosis from a very-low-carbohydrate diet will not become ketoacidosis, as the lowered pH is buffered adequately. And the average dieter will not even reach ketosis because it is difficult to maintain a sub-100 gram carbohydrate diet without conscious effort.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I think it's a song about a relationship with a girl. My interpretation is the whole song is about heartbreak. The girl is hurting him while he wants so badly to love her and for her to love him. Slowly, though, he realizes they aren't meant to be and breaks up with her.

Him running through the forest is a visual play on words of him [pining](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pining) for the girl. He wants her so bad but she's cold and hurts him—she shoots him through the heart. During this Joe sings about needing chainmail for his heart (maybe it's his fault for being hurt) and adding more tears to the sea while he's sleeplessly embracing her. He also the same symbolism later to say she's cold saying ""Your heart wears knight armour."" Mockingly, Miley sings, ""I'm a female rebel"" over and over.

He keeps getting hurt, but finally he runs out of the forest as if he's losing his feelings for her. ""Realization grew on me"" Finally, after a few more arrows in his back, he takes his final fatal shot through his jugular pushing him over the edge. ""I’m there for you, be there for me""  He picks up a can of gas and douses himself while Joe sings in french that he still has hope (I believe it's for himself, not the relationship)—not coincidentally his quote about hope is from a french poem about despair and being lost. I don't believe he's giving up and self destructing at the end though; he's cleansing himself while he tries to smile. Right after, he get's a focused look on his face and then a volley of flaming arrows are let loose at him signifying they broke up. He's about to end; he's a metaphor for their relationship.

---

The french is a quote from a poem, L'espoir en Dieu. It's about a man in torment losing his faith. He asks how he can search for joy when life is full of evil, war, and despair. Then he begs for god to show himself so that the world can just be happy and sing his praises. I think the line ""I’ll hum the song the soldiers sing; As they march outside our window"" from the song might reference this too.

Part of the Poem in english (translated by someone else as my french sucks):  
&gt;[...]  
""What shall we do? Seek joy, command the wise,  
Rejoice and die; the gods to sleep advise.""  
[...]  
""What then remains? Reason revolts, breaks out,  
Tries to believe, in vain, the heart to doubt.  
The Christian frightens, but the atheist creed  
Despite the senses, shall not hear nor heed.  
To truly pious men impious seem,  
Me, the indifferent, merely crazy deem.  
To whom shall I resort, what voice’s sound  
Shall soothe this heart when doubt inflicts its wound?""  
[...]  
Shatter that canopy of space  
That hides our eager quest of Theee.  
Tear down the veil that mars thy grace,  
And show thyself, most amiably.  ","1406851453"

I'd guess that it'd take about a second to start executing code on the target system. If the malware waits a minute or two, do you really think you have super awesome ninja reflexes that'll let you unplug it beforehand? Do you think the average user does?


&gt; Next, it would need to be code that runs on both Windows and Linux.

The main 'payload' can be stored on the USB disk itself; all the malicious keyboard has to do is trigger the execution. Just run through various sequences like `win-r d:/a.exe` or `alt-f2 /mnt/media/a` or whatever until you get something.

&gt; Also, I consider Linux to be more secure by default when the attacker doesn't know the root password.

While it's true that on Windows a malicious USB drive could just autoclick through the UAC prompts, if an attacker has executed code on a Linux machine they can, e.g., ptrace all your processes, muck with your .bashrc to set $PATH such that `sudo` tells the malware your password, modify your browser state... There's really no way to recover, and I wouldn't keep using the machine without formatting the entire drive (or at *least* destroying that user account) first.","1406851455"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have two main pieces of advice.

A. Have some idea, theme, or purpose in mind for your world. This doesn't have to be very complex - just something that you can use as a focus for your design. This can range from something like ""a world for player characters to explore and adventure"" to ""a post-apocalyptic steampunk world dealing with crippling scacity.""

B. Take inspiration from everything. If there's something you like in a story remember it. Maybe you like the culture from a book, the power system from a tv show, and the conflict from a movie. Your world doesn't have to be completely unique - it just has to be its own individual world. Try not to copy everything from a single source, but don't be afraid to take large swaths of ideas from things you like. There is plenty of room to give your own personal touch.

C. Let your world build itself as much as possible. Extrapolate from the details you create to help build the rest of the world. This not only makes things easier for you, but it also helps make the world seem more alive and interconnected.


____

For example I'll use a world I just started building recently.

A. I want a world that will let me explore a heavily-structured power system. I want to be able to create characters with interesting well-defined powers and play around with them to come up with interesting uses and ideas with those powers.

B. I'm mainly taking inspiration from ""A Certain Magical Index"" world for this setting, although I'm also mixing in bits of other works. Other big inspirations are probably World of Darkness and Hunter X Hunter, although I'm sure there are a huge number of inspirations that I'm forgetting or are too subtle to recognize. (Especially since I'm not very far into building the world.)

C. Here is some of the extrapolation logic I used to build up the world:

Given: Setting is present time with alternate history. Magic emerged in the past, conspiracies emerged and created a masquerade. Things are mostly similar otherwise.

Leads to: I need to design one of the conspiracies. Maybe religion?

Leads to: Starts with real-world religion, magic appears and new canon emerges, religious conspiracy is formed.

Leads to: Obvious choice is Christianity. 

Leads to: Actually can include all Abrahamic Religion (Judaism, Christianity, Islam).

Leads to: This explains power structure - triumvirate. Acts as a loose federation, with leadership largely for interfaction disputes.

You can see how I started with very little information but just kept teasing out ideas that fit. I didn't do anything too creative or difficult here, but suddenly I have the framework for my first conspiracy and I understand it's command structure. This tells me a lot of other aspects of the conspiracy too. For example, I know that for a triumvirate to work as a story element I want the three factions to have a similar end goal, and I know I want very obvious areas of conflict between each pair. The former explains why they would form a union, the latter gives options for storytelling/plot events.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;The answer to my question, that we've landed on, is that, with the modern day rapid movement and mixing of people aside, Kazakhstan lies in a gradiential spot between the far east and the west. It has been an area that has blended various human traits unique to its neighboring groups on either side of its border. 

Which is why the question of whether they are Caucasoid or Mongoloid is inappropriate.  Those terms are racial terms.  Race is a cultural construct, not a scientific one, especially in the current peer-reviewed consensus of the present.  It was inappropriate of you to use racial terms when asking about the people of a nation-state, or ethnicity.  It just doesn't fit.  I don't mean ""inappropriate"" as in, ""Shame on you!""  I mean the terms are not congruent to the subject matter.

I'm not discouraging scientific discussion.  The problem I'm having is that this is an anonymous, public internet discussion, and so I have a certain amount of skepticism when someone seems to know all about the 40,000-year-old approximate age of the post-African-diaspora population of humanity, and presumably that that diaspora spent the majority of the last 40,000 in central Asia intermixing, but doesn't understand why 18th century European socio-political racial terms aren't appropriate to the discussion of the phenotypical ethnic characteristics of central Asian peoples.  It kinda seems like you're race-baiting.  If you're not, you can't blame me for being suspicious.

As far as the Brazillian twins, you obviously haven't heard the story before.  Feel free to Google it.  They look identical (you can Google their pictures), and could pass for either ""black"" or ""white"" in Brazil.  One university thought one looked ""black"" one day, another administrator labeled the other ""white.""  It goes to show that race can be quite arbitary when the phenotypical presentation of genetic subsets of people is not clear cut (such as in Brazil, or central Asia, or among mixed race Americans, and others), especially when two people have the exact same genes.","1406851461"

It's primarily men who hold to those types of values, not to say women don't either, and it's also a large part on how someone is raised. Fact is there's nothing wrong with it, in my opinion because of my experiences and upbringing it's more admirable to deny gifts. Of course, it's also a cultural thing, since Pashtun's in Afghanistan it's considered a HUGE insult to deny gifts, especially tea, it's about the American equivelant to taking a christmas present, shitting on it, stomping it, pissing on it, then throwing it in the trash and lighting it on fire.

For me at least, and a lot of people, being offered something like this or anything for that matter puts you in a very weird spot. By accepting it, you feel as if you've bowed down to them or put yourself into a lower spot than them, along with feeling bad about yourself thinking you couldn't do it on your own. On the other hand, something especially like this scenario mentioned can help out a lot and is technically the smart move, and denying gifts from people often puts the person giving the gift in a similar spot of them feeling like they've done something wrong or that they're below them.

Generally, gifts are treacherous territory, it depends entirely on the person, how they were raised, and their culture that determines their reactions.","1406851462"

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","I did a bunch of research and looked into many different Super Smashed Brothers variants, but they all shared one common problem. 

They're all too damn complicated. Lose a stock, drink, die from a bob-bomb, drink, if you kill yourself with a bob-bomb, drink twice, while on the spawn platform, chug. 

Naw. Too much to keep track of. So I took the best elements of what I found and made my own. It works wonderfully. 

Here's how it works:

Everyone starts as the character at the upper left hand screen. We play PM, so that's Wario. 

Set stocks to 1. Timer at 2 minutes. Items on or off, up to you. 

How stage select is done is also up to you. We just do random on all stages. 

When you win a match you take a drink then you take your token and move it one space to the right. I.E. Mario in PM.

If you are stuck on a character or don't like a particular playstyle or whatever john you may have you can voluntarily take a drink to move your token over one space. I normally have to do this for Falco because spacies and I do not get along. 

That's literally it. 

Matches are quick, generally between 20 seconds to a minute at the longest. So you will be drinking often enough, but not so damn quick you are going to get plastered in the first 10 minutes. We generally play a good 2 or 3 hours and we are feeling pretty good by the end of it. There is a good chance you will also not be able to clear the character select screen, especially if you play with 4 people. ","1406851471"

They're trying to make sure that struggling families have a better chance. 

BUT when looking at it from our stand point , it's a choice. If you're struggling, you shouldn't have kids. If they create a child tax credit, they need to even out the playing field by offering a tax credit that is also attainable by us. 

Ie. Tax credit when you adopt animals from the shelter etc.

"photocritique","t5_2qymy","I like all the negative space. It makes it clear that she is running or dancing alone–it takes way more courage to do that than to tag along with everyone else.

The overexposed left of the frame, and under exposed right gives a sense of optimism as she is headed into the light, and smiling.

The composition of her heading into the narrow end of the frame breaks a basic rule–your subjects are usually supposed to be heading into the more open side of the frame. I think it does it in a good way here, though. She doesn't feel cramped and it gived the shot a sense of mystery.

Cropping of the legs at the knees is problematic. You didn't crop at the knees, though, you cropped below the knees. It works. The left leg is cropped a little high, but you see enough of the bent right leg that it doesn't look weird, imo.

The one thing I find problematic about this photo, and no one else has seemed to mention, is the shutter speed. It's just a stop or two too slow. You managed to freeze her semi-obscured right leg, the trailing edge of her dress, and a bit of her hair. Everything else is soft. I wish you had been able to freeze her face, her arm, the front of her dress, her torso... these are the parts that matter. The overexposure would have made sharpness there really pop and look wonderful, but instead it emphasizes the softness.","1406851473"

the church and christianity are safe houses for many people, a place to look to for guidance and consolation, a shoulder to rest on and help to seek out when you need it - be it a loved one passing, a guilty conscience, a wedding ceremony. humans are tribal peoples, and the church is a tribe - one formed from the ground up under the central tenet of loving one another. if you think that makes someone weak then  maybe joining it would do you some good.","1406851474"

"podemos","t5_31h78","""1º) Porque si “la verdad no debe confundirse con la opinión de la mayoría” no se entiende que un asunto de análisis lógico como es la demostración de argumentaciones falaces pueda resolverse mediante votación.""

Se trata de penalizar el uso de falacias, simple y llanamente. A partir de dicho acto se derivan una serie de rankings que nos darán una nota, y esa nota se multiplica con el número de votos, no es tan difícil, así podeemos estar seguros de que ningún populista, manipulador de masas, llegará a alcanzar, jamás, el poder.

""Y 2º) porque la complejidad de los razonamientos prácticos hace que puedan incluir defectos lógicos (falacias) que no invaliden las legítimas y justas pretensiones que los inspiran.""

Me parece que no sabes lo que es una falacia. Es una mentira, sutil, eso sí, pero mentira, al fin y al cabo. 
¿Algo defectuoso?, claro que es natural, si está hecho por un estúpido que lo único que quiere es desfogar sus emociones a través del discurso político.

""Lo que determina la calidad democrática no es estar en un determinado puesto de un ranking sino la efectiva profundidad y transparencia con que se delibera. Un asunto de honestidad intelectual.""

No, la honestidad intelectual no es suficiente, debemos alcanzar el siguiente peldaño: la dignidad intelectual, que es mucho más difícil de conseguir y, por lo tanto, muchísimo más valiosa que el hecho de publicar las cuentas de una organización política. Eso no es democracia, sino marketing.

""El problema que parece que pretendes afrontar es el de la estulticia del público, y quieres resolverlo apelando a la autoridad de los rankings (falacia ad verecundiam?). Pienso que lo que hay que hacer en los debates es tratar al público como personas adultas.""

Tu llámalo autoridad, si quieres, yo lo llamaré inteligencia, yo lo llamaré fortaleza ideológica. No puedes decir que una autoridad en arte puede ser capaz de hacer cualquier cosa, pero sí que puedes decir que es capaz de ser artista, así que, lo siento, pero no he incurrido en ninguna falacia.

""En cualquier caso tu propuesta es interesante y se podría trabajar en ella, para ver lo que da de sí.""

Lo estoy montando en plan privado con unos contactos, lo que más me interesaría de PODEMOS es que participase en la beta, para afinarlo, y que lo publicitarais. Podríamos negociarlo.

Hago públicos los rankings, aviso: sus nombres no son definitivos, todavía.

Los rankings

Ranking “la más sabia”.

La organización a la cabeza de este ranking será la que habiendo intervenido el mayor número de veces haya obtenido el mayor número de argumentos ratificados. Es decir que en el caso de que una organización obtenga 99 ratificaciones en 100 intervenciones y otra 300 en 1000, la que estará en la cima será la segunda.

Ranking “la más fuerte”.

Estará encabezado por la organización cuya proporción del número de respuestas a sus intervenciones invalidadas entre el número total de respuestas a sus intervenciones, estén ratificadas o no, se acerque más a 1 y, en este caso, también se aplicaría la norma del ranking “la más sabia”, es decir que si una organización tiene una proporción de 0,99 constituida por 100 respuestas y otra tiene una de 0,66 con 1000 la que gana es la segunda.

Ranking “la más excelente”

Será elaborado a partir de la media de la proporción de respuestas invalidadas entre todas las respuestas cuando una organización ha dado un argumento válido. Por ejemplo: una organización ha respondido a 3 argumentos, y esas respuestas son válidas. La primera respuesta está en un grupo de 10 respuestas, de las cuales hay 2 respuestas válidas, entre las que se encuentra la respuesta de esa organización. Pues se divide 2 entre 10 para hallar la proporción y se hace lo mismo con las otras 2 respuestas, luego se suman las proporciones y se dividen entre tres, así obtenemos la media, la organización que se acerque más a cero gana pero, eso sí, aplicando la misma norma de los rankings “la más sabia” y “la más fuerte”, por lo que si una organización tiene una media de 0,25 con 10 respuestas válidas y otra 0,30 con 20 gana ésta, la segunda.

Ranking “la más temida”

Estará encabezado por aquella organización que tenga menos respuestas a sus intervenciones e inicios de debate. Por ejemplo: una organización tiene dos intervenciones ratificadas, la primera cuenta con 3 respuestas, la segunda con 5, pues se hace la media, y ya está. Se vuelve a aplicar la misma regla de los rankings “la más sabia”, “la más fuerte” y “la más excelente”, la organización que obtenga el número más bajo teniendo el mayor número de intervenciones e inicios de debate gana.

Ranking “la más intensa”

Conformado a partir de la siguiente fórmula: el tiempo de actividad ""parlamentaria"" de la organización, que es el tiempo que pasa en la sección de debate el o los campeones de ésta, dividido entre el tiempo total pasado desde la creación de ésta, multiplicado por la media de las notas del resto de los rankings, ""la más sabia"", ""la más fuerte"", ""la más excelente"" y ""la más temida"". El resultado debe restarse a la media de esos cuatro rankings. La nota más alta gana.

Ranking “la mejor”

Encabezado por aquella organización cuya nota producto de la media entre las notas de los cinco rankings anteriores sea más alta.

The joke in our family is that she has spit n string disease because that's all that's holding her together.  I understand why she did this.  She's a single mom and I'm an only child so if something permanent happened to her, I would have been alone.  I didn't realize how much she hid from me about her health until I was an adult.  She'd had cancer when I was 10 and I honestly had no idea how bad it had been for her.  I would see people on TV reacting really badly to chemo treatments and comment on it to her and then she told me there was a lot I hadn't seen.  She had apparently done a lot of throwing up and there were days when she simply couldn't drive from the fatigue.  To this day, she can't donate blood because her veins have completely collapsed.  I had no idea until college just how bad it was for her.

Edit: Forgot to add how it affects me.  I have a pretty intense fear of her dying unexpectedly.  I am also pretty worried about cancer treatment.  I am worried about getting cancer too, but mostly I worry about the long term effects of chemo.  15 years later my mother has not recovered.  Sure, she doesn't throw up randomly anymore and she's not *as* tired, but her memory is shot, she is still in lots of pain and the chemo screwed up her brain enough so that she can't write poetry or fiction anymore.  She was a very eloquent writer before the cancer and she lost the ability.","1406851479"

"aoe2","t5_2sg7u","Microsoft really did a number on this franchise.  In its day it rivaled starcraft and C&amp;C for RTS popularity, but Microsoft never invested in the multiplayer networking.

Then GFWL came out and they hitched AoE3 and tried to a cartoony AoE:online.  That last one was fun, but its business model screamed pay to win, nickle and diming, and heavily restricted content.  Did you know that if your wife was watching Netflix on the Xbox when you wanted to play aoe:o you couldn't?  Yeah....

They just botched it.  The steam release to RoN and AoE2 have given it what it really needs - multiplayer access not tied to something Microsoft built, and its having a rennasance.

The appeal? Over a dozen nations with unique play styles and a five resource economy (if you include pop).  Random maps rather than scripted maps, and a good number of various timing rushes.","1406851479"

"CriticalTheory","t5_2tmcb","I would definitely point to Slavoj Zizek's masterpiece ""The Sublime Object of Ideology."" 

It's a short book and while it's an intense read, Slavoj divides his chapters into tiny pieces with subheadings. If you don't have a background in psychoanalytic theory (specifically Lacan) it may be a challenging read. 

To tempt you further, here is a brief description. 

Zizek explains that Ideology(in the Marxist sense) is structured as an unconscious fantasy that regulates reality itself. How this relates to political dissent, is how dissent itself is semantically structured as a ""counter"" narrative or a ""rebellion"" to reality itself since the dominant institutional power (police, govt, media) is only interested in propogating capitalist ideology as the only way to experience reality.

To dissent or to voice your opinion would be not only a violation of political correctness and/or laws, but a deeper protest on the nature of reality itself. 

This is from the Zizek angle, you would get more from reading his book.","1406851481"

As for God telling people to kill other people, I'm not sure I understand what the point of that would be. If God is omnipotent as you claim, why would he have one person kill another?

"gadgets","t5_2qgzt","A basic one pound fighting robot. Remember Battle Bots? Like that but smaller and more amateurish. There are probably fights near you.

A robot needs 5 basic things: a radio system, a speed controller, motors and wheels, a chassis, a battery, and maybe a weapon. The one pound class is small enough that you can win plenty of fights without an active weapon. You'll need to do a lot of shopping around to stay under $150. Your biggest expense will likely be the radio system and while most people will recommend investing in a good system, you can get a 2.4 GHz receiver and transmitter from Hobby King for around $50-$60. An ESC is the what takes the radio signals from the receiver and drives the motors. The Sabertooth 5 amp RC ESC is great for 1 pounders and fairly inexpensive at around $50-$60. That leaves ~ $40 for everything else which is tight but you can make it work.","1406851487"
"ABCDesis","t5_2yfr0","&gt;Religion is such a cancer to the human race.

This is generally an unnuanced POV historically and currently. Religion often provides an outlet for people to vent, and I would argue worshipping some ""sky fairy"" (which isn't really applicable in many religions) is better than the state religion in the USSR worshipping a totalitarian state. Not to mention many religious organizations donate quite a bit. As much as we hate on early Catholics, they did quite a few humanitarian works. A lot of those decrying slaughter of Native Americans were Catholic priests. 

Here's another question; many Gurdwaras are luxuriously made of marble, the biggest out of gold. Yet, this is all community funded; what is also community funded is a kitchen open to all poor people regardless of any circumstances (or any religion). Do you think it's bad the community chooses to fund gold plating as well as a free community kitchen?","1406851487"

"wicked_edge","t5_2s46m","The only one of these razors I own is a Merkur (the 37C) and it is a slant bar razor which is generally not considered good for beginners.  Most of my collection is vintage, but I have bought a couple razors from Amazon as well as one from Maggard.  On name brand razors Maggard doesn't offer that deep of a discount over Amazon and in some cases it is more (i.e. a Parker 22R costs $27.70 on Maggard and $28.77 on Amazon; the Merkur 37C costs $49.50 on Maggard and $46.99 on Amazon).  The real value of Maggard is their own line of razors.  You will be hard pressed to find a better quality razor at a lower price than the Maggard line.  They've even got a stainless steel handled razor (the MR8) for ~$25.  That's crazy cheap for anything stainless.

I personally don't buy into the Amazon dislike here. If you can get the razor you want from there cheaper and delivered in two days, then go for it.  On the other hand, if you want to support a great small business and get great deals on quality razors, then look to Maggard.","1406851487"

Why do I think that? Well reds and blues are the furthest from rubber domes. Reds are linear force, unlike rubber domes, and blues are clicky, unlike rubber domes.
Browns are lightly tactile, which is very similar to rubber domes. They just aren't as mushy.

If your first board starts at the extremes, you get a good taste of what each end offers, so you can properly judge what you like. It also makes your first mechanical experience something extra special.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Then all adults involved need to get on the same page to recondition her so that she realizes - and sees - that negative attention won't get her attention. This can be done slowly by spending 20 minutes a day with her to give her positive attention. The timing of this can be tricky, because you don't want the 20 minutes of positive attention to be connected in any way, shape or form with anything she's done to receive negative attention. 

This behavioral modification will not work overnight. It will take time. Lots of time. If you can, have the 20 minutes a day happen at the same time. So that the 10yo can begin to count on it. You can increase the 20 minutes if you feel it's going to benefit the child.  But I cannot stress to you enough that the time for positive attention cannot in any way, shape or form be connected to any behavior that she's done to receive negative attention.

Decrease the motivation for negative attention. But this won't happen if all the adults aren't on the same page. 

20 minutes a day of positive attention is just one of the things that can be done regarding behavioral modification. 

But ANYTHING done to strengthen the motivation for negative attention makes this journey all the harder. It's like starting all over again, even if you've been doing the 20 minutes of positive attention every day for a long while. You give kids an inch, they'll take a mile. Gotta be firm. Gotta follow-through.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Our productivity gains have largely been in the high-tech and IT sectors. Burgers, however, are still largely flipped the way they were 30 years ago

in the actual mcdonalds, things look pretty similar, but the whole logistical set up behind the store has been massively transformed.  shipping, inventory, supply chain management, corporate structure, everything outside the store is massively more efficient/productive than it was 40 years ago.

&gt;There's no inherent reason why the wages of the lowest quintile should keep pace with aggregate productivity.

a barber today does the same job he did in ancient greece.  he gets paid a lot more today, in real terms, because the opportunity cost of employing him elsewhere rises with the general level of productivity.

&gt;On another note, who is ready for the tri-mandate?

here, you are absolutely correct.  the dual mandate is already silly and leads to lack of accountability,   but then the whole structure of the fed makes no sense (why the regional banks, why make your central bank your bank regulator too) a triple mandate is not a good idea, but it could hardly make things worse.","1406851493"

"touhou","t5_2qvi5","Attacking humans was once the point of the youkai's existence. However, the creation of the Great Boundary (which seperates Gensokyo from the outside world) made this more difficult to do regularly. Human population was becoming increasingly scarce, so youkai needed to start to find other sources of food.

The existence of humans in Gensokyo was endangered. The Vampire Contract/Spell Card Rules were created in part due to this. Some of the included conditions are that youkai cannot eat humans in the human village, and youkai cannot eat humans that they have defeated with the spellcard rules. So humans have a couple ways of staying safe.

However, youkai still often attack wandering humans from the outside world. *""It's explicitly stated in [Yukari's] Perfect Cherry Blossom profile that she's the one responsible for outsiders ending up in Gensokyo, where most of them get devoured by youkai.""* So she's like a food supplier of sorts.

This is what I understand from the sources I found, so maybe take some of what I said with a grain of salt since I might be mistaken about some things.

These guys may have been offended, and rightfully so, but they come across as bullies in the video in my opinion. This clown already knows he's full of shit. The people that know him probably already know he's full of shit. All these two did was set their opinion to rest. Maybe that was good enough for them, but it's not going to stop this delusional valor thief from throwing on his poorly fitting, unpressed bullshit dress blues and trying to score some cheese points with the local civilians. 

When I was in the Army there were plenty of these guys. New guys to a unit seemed to always pop in with all these medals and patches and shit thinking no one would notice, and most always got caught and lost some rank over it. I guess with the video being out on the internet and potentially ruining the ruse for this guy in particular it may be worthwhile after all. I just don't feel like the Marines in the video conducted themselves honorably.

edit: I'll take the down votes because I accept that my opinion isn't going to be the most popular one. Yes, it's offensive. Fuck this guy and everyone that looks like him. Fuck every soulless valor thief that ever tried to pull this kind of bullshit. But there's an honorable way to handle these people, and this isn't it.","1406851494"

Strawman argument.  I said the current legal routes are good and worth the cost.  Obviously there are some sites with prices and readers that are not worth the cost.

&gt;  Am I right? If so, I completely agree

On those points yes.  

If you actually check the whole parent, I said this a couple times in response to people and got downvoted heavily.  You can see this opinion is the minority, even on a forum that does not want to have anything to do with illegal hosting sites.  People just want it to be free.  So no matter what solution happens, people will be upset.   Obviously free isn't an option (all host sites steal content from fan scanlators who ask them not to; so even that type of advertising service isn't viable.)  If mangahere had to pay for their translations they would probably shut down.  If Crunchyroll hosted high quality scanlations done for free on their website and charged for it, they would be shut down.  It's one or the other.","1406851501"

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","Screaming Jesus with his nuts clamped with battery cables Christ Sony. 

Sony can absolutely kill with this service by offering subscription blocks like 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and annually. Yet there it is still with insane prices. 

Why price a game at $50 bucks for 90 days when: You could pay the same price, maybe a little more, or substantially less and own the fucking game for life? Makes no sense at all. 

Even the 7 day and 30 day prices - you could go out and find those games less than those price block prices if you look hard enough. Hell, you don't really have to look hard at all. 

A quote from Kotaku article:
""""One of those things that we heard about was we received some critical feedback around certain price points as you're very familiar with,"" said Buser. ""As a direct result of that feedback, we're gonna soon introduce titles starting at $1.99. We hope this offers users a wider range of price points to choose from, and we encourage our testers to continue to tell us about what their experience is with every aspect of the service.""

Your very own beta testers are telling you these prices are insane. Most of the feedback given on this potentially amazing and epic service is people wanting a subscription service. 

Another quote. 
""It's unclear just what that subscription offering will look like—Buser wouldn't go into details—but if it isn't something like ""unlimited rentals for a reasonable amount of money per month,"" I don't see how it could ever be good for gamers. We are talking about old games here, not the hottest new shipments that are coming in at $59.99 a pop.""

You don't see how that is good for gamers? Gamers are telling you they WANT a damn subscription service. You want to charge essentially steak prices for old games via these price block allotments. 

Yet a subscription service is not good for gamers. Well no shit. We know they are old games. We know Sonys' vast PS1/PS2/PS3/PSVita Library. That is what We, Gamers, PS console owners or multi-console owners, want to play... and play at monthly subscription price. Not at some whacked out block prices and duration rentals that are more than the cost of used games of the same name. 

PSNow + monthly subscription = Epic service is epic. 

The way PSNow is with insane prices and duration rentals is asinine. 4 hours is stupid and 90 days is unnecessary and outrageous. Sony is shitting the bed the way it is now. So they can shit the bed with this service as it is now. They can kill it with a monthly service. The gamers know this.

Ah, the great Civilisation Questionnaire as devised by the Great Civilised Minds:

* does your art look similar to the European masters? Why not?
* do you use stone as a building material? If you answer ""no, mud"" here, just piss off now and stop embarrassing yourself.
* so you use stone, but do you have flying buttresses?
* fine, so you have those too, but do you use glass in your buildings?
* okay, but do you have something similar to the great European buildings? And no, pyramids or ziggurats are not an acceptable answer; those are so 4000 years ago.
* do you have large cities? Large in this context is on par with the largest European population centres at the time.
* have you mastered steel?
* do your armies use it?
* are those armies actually any good? Because otherwise change the answers to the previous two questions to ""no"", you wasteful slacker.
* are those armies any good against an European army though? And no cheating here, we'll probably test you on this one.
* does your technology level match that of Europe? Be precise, no faffing about with ""we're more developed in these other areas""
* what about your military technology? We actually don't care too much about the other stuff, so if you fill in ""yes"" here, you can answer the previous one with ""yes"" as well.
* do you have writing? And we mean writing in proper books, not some funky knot system, or some symbols carved in stone.
* can we translate those writings into a proper language easily? Otherwise there's not much point answering the previous one with ""yes"".

If you've answered any of the previous questions with ""no"", you're a primitive savage. Please take a number and wait for it to be called by our Civilisation and Colonisation office. If you answered all of them with ""yes"", take a number anyway. We'll probably find something else that turns you into a primitive savage like some funky religious thing that disgusts us.","1406851503"

Soval was born ""prior to 2032"" ([M-A](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Soval)), and could even be ""alive"" as we speak.

I'm guessing this documentary was filmed a number of years before TOS (since both Garth and Gill are participating), but after the war itself. 2250s let's say.

So Soval would be somewhere around 250 years old. We don't know how long Vulcans can live, but it was implied in Sarek's TNG appearances that over 200 was pretty old. Soval looks *really* good for that age.","1406851505"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I think we agree more than is superficially clear, you'll have to forgive my brash rhetoric, I don't talk to libertarians much.

However the anti-state ideology is already long past its first major upsurge, which emerged in the mid 1800s and continued on in some places through the 1930s. The ""virtue of selfishness"" is very close to a highly advanced thought that is the principle of self-respect and freedom. Hegel would probably compare this to **the** most advanced thought, that of the spirit of rationality achieving its purpose in the material world.

The weird right-wing reactionary reinterpretation of anarchist market socialism under Rand and their ilk had to be couched in reactionary rhetoric in order to be permissible in the oppressive political climate of the times.

Marx tended to deride the anarchism of his times as ""bourgeois socialism"" or in Bakunin's case something utopian, but we can see that the core of his philosophy had a great deal of ""libertarian socialist"" or anarcho-syndicalist tendencies. Great article I read the other day: [What Marx Should Have Said to Kropotkin](http://socialiststandardmyspace.blogspot.com/2006/06/what-marx-should-have-said-to-kropotkin.html)

But anyway the upshot of the right-wing libertarian reactionaries is that they become a new causeway for genuine anarchist ideology, once adherents recognize the primary means by which the state facilitates coercion. You're certainly right that this idea is a ways off from becoming manifest in the world, but I tend to think of it as lots of small battles rather than being really far away from any one ideology.

&gt; Tearing down the state isn't the answer. Building community is.

Couldn't agree more. Actually when I say ""anti-statist"" I specifically mean the type of politician that tends to serve as a community organizer rather than a tax spender.","1406851509"

&gt;

&gt;The __Gorean__ philosophy is a philosophy espoused in the [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) novels by [John Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Norman). A number of fans of Norman's work have attempted to live their lives according to this philosophy  

&gt;The most conspicuous Gorean departure from mainstream modern norms is that Goreans promote [sexual master-slave relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domination_and_submission_(BDSM\)). Some of this philosophy is concerned with ""[order of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece#Historical_views)"" and the relations between men and women, which may or may not take the form of a master-and-slave dynamic.

It's hard to say how I'll react if any of my kids get into it, but I'd like to think that I would just sit them down and explain how it is. There's nothing wrong, in moderation, but getting high can be a quagmire that sucks you into a world of passive behaviors. Instead of playing sports or being active, you very likely just sit on the couch and watch tv/play video games. It's just like alcohol.

They didn't bother resubmitting or notifying me until I actually requested another ride.  Oh, and you can't fix that problem on the mobile app.  Adding another card altogether also doesn't fix it.

Furious and about to be late, I called Luxor.  The driver was there in 3 minutes and I was at the airport for less then an Uber would have cost.

The batshit crazy thing here is that the smaller 2 book set is more expensive than the 3 book set.

3 Book Version
£150, €200, 1500dkr, 1800skr, 1650nkr, 750zl, USD$250, CAN$300, AUD$270, NZ$320, 1500rmb, ¥24000

2 Book Version
£110, €145, 1100dkr, 1300skr, 1200nkr, 550zl, USD$180, CAN$220, AUD$300, NZ$360, 1100rmb, ¥25000

So the smaller, 2 book version is MORE expensive than the 3 book set in Australia, New Zealand and Japan…
The 3 book version is only $20 more than the US in Australia (which is a nice change) but then the smaller set ends up being 60% more.

**Biggest Surprise**: Space Dandy because I'm still reeling over it being nothing like I ever imagined it would be from last season. Although if you want a more legitimate answer, then Aldnoah Zero for not (yet) going the way of Psycho Pass.

**Biggest Disappointment**: Rail Wars. At least it's fun to laugh at. [I still will never get over just how extraordinarily dumb this is](http://i.minus.com/ihDXy1Qpuca6d.jpg).

**Most Interesting**: Space Dandy. It's 2deep4u but without being even slightly pretentious. It actually makes me wish I was more familiar with science fiction and Surrealism just so I could ""get it"". Even without that though, this show is incredibly imaginative, funny, and interesting.

**Best OP**: Aldnoah Zero OP

**Best ED**: Rokujouma ED

**Favourite Male Lead**: Mikorin from Nozaki-kun. How can this dude be so moe? This is the last thing I expected.

**Favourite Female Lead**: Illya's still angel, but, just to give someone else a shot, I'll pick Sakura Chiyo from Nozaki-kun because those bows are just too cute and those faces she makes are just too hilarious.

**Worst Male Lead**: Shibaki Kouta from Rurumo. It's mostly the assumptions the author is making about what constitutes kindness that's making me hate him.

**Worst Female Lead**: I 'unno.

**Best OST**: Aldnoah Zero OST

**Best Art**: I can't actually decide this time around. I can't think of any clear winners.

**Best Animation**: I'll just give this to aikatsu again, I guess.

**Biggest ""Wow this is a dull and just weird looking reboot""**: Sailor Moon Crystal

**Most Absurd (Read ""Best"") Premise**: Rokujouma

**Best show that made me squee due to getting a third season**: Aikatsu

**Most Fun Show to Make Fun of**: Rail Wars, where you can freeze electricity, beach concerts are done in giant tents, and concerts only have a single staff member.

**Biggest Hat**: Majimoji Rurumo","1406851518"

There was the post from the seperatist leader about the AN-26 they shot down which was deleted once they realised that was MH17. Where do you think do the seperatists get their weapons? They cant have robbed enough ukrainian armories to get enough weapons to defend themselves. The borders between russia and ukraine are still not closed and fighters travel into the eastern ukraine. Russia lied about their troops on the Krim until it was too late. They make false allegations against the ukraine and the west daily which get debunked pretty quick. They have an interest in keeping the ukraine instable to weaken the west and show the remaining ex-sowjet states which arent yet in the eu what happens if they want their freedom. There are reports of artillery fire from russian territory onto ukrainian troops, there are alot of sources saying that many seperatists are from russia.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Hey man. Um skateboards have bushings.

 Additionally car suspension is nothing like a skateboard. Modern cars have independent suspension for each wheel while a skateboard truck pivots on a fulcrum called the kingpin. 

Traditional (street) kingpin set ups have a nearly vertically oriented  kingpin making high speed travel unstable because of the amount of leverage exerted upon the bushings in that orientation. 

Inverted (downhill) kingpin set ups are exactly that: a truck that is designed in an inverted orientation to not only produce a tighter turning radius but also a more stable ride at speed. The kingpin is also at a much steeper rake degree in this orientation  aiding in stability and facilitating bigger bushings. 

To answer your question though wobble is caused by the rider making small corrections to his stance at high speeds and those corrections producing a vibration which becomes exaggerated within the board that cannot be dampened out because of the board length, bushing durometer (hardness), truck width, wheel durometer, or kingpin angle of the riders specific set up. 


I would suggest some Paris 180s, with double barrel bushings. Durometer pending your weight.

Well, the network code isn't to blame for this. IMO SOE has been in the MMO genre for long enough to know their stuff about this. For the record, it works with ""opcodes"", which are already one of the smallest sizeable data which can be sent from one point to another to reduce network overhead, allow more data to be sent for more ""instantaneousness"", and reduce the processing power needed compared to other client/server/clients (notice the ""s"") communication protocols.

If we were dealing with mere incompetence, our leaders should occasionally make a mistake in our favor. We . . . are not dealing with coincidence or stupidity, but with planning and brilliance. - Gary Allen

It's not extremely out of the realm of possibility that villain could be shoving with worse here on the river, especially given your logic of 'he might be value betting this river', but I agree with the others in that underpairs to a 7 or a 6 would probably not shove river. 88 or 99 or TT is definitely possible, but I think villain's range is capped to mostly hands that beat me on river, but I'm getting good enough odds to call.

After thinking about what everyone has said in the thread, I would actually now be more inclined to bet slightly smaller on turn. This is only so that the villain's range by the river is wide enough for me to consider calling... although now that I think about it I think betting turn would make the sizing for calling river be a bit more awkward...

So it is not clear what remedy they would ask for. But the biggest is that the House is claiming that the president is breaking the law. There is a clear obvious constitutional solution here: if Obama has broken the law impeach him.

Finally, ""he's going to struggle with libel"" meant 'He can sue for libel but I don't think there's much chance he would win'.

Your first paragraph is a flaming load of nonsense. People get away with illegal things all the time. Not everyone always has the appetite to sue and it won't get them the vindication they want.

Setting that aside, we used to have some very large birds, Argentavis magnificens &amp; Pelagornis sandersi for example, with wingspans of 6meters or more.  Both have been extinct for a few million years, about 5 million in the former case and perhaps 25 million in the latter case.  We don't know why they went extinct, but it could be something as simple as surpassing their wing loading capacity and hitting an evolutionary dead end.

We do know that their smaller relatives, the Tetratorns, which were about half again as big as living condors went extinct relatively recently in North America as a result of the megafauna extinctions.

Flight is energetically expensive and big birds need a lot of high energy food.  When the megafauna went extinct around the world a wide range of other species that relied on those animals also went extinct, from Tetratorns to dung beetles and dire wolves.

&gt;  A lot of red pillers seem bitter and angry at women

 *really?*  They *do*, do they? ""bitter and angry?""  

 I don't think so ... but then again, I'm a guy, so what would *I* know?! 

  Could you *possibly* provide an example of a ""bitter and angry"" OP/poster?

&gt;  I think a  little bit of normal is the best way of doing things

 Is that right?  Well, damn, sweety, that's *real nice* of you to care and share *your opinions* and all ,, for *opinions* is *all* they are,  BUT,  hot damn darlin, we don't *do* much ""normal"" around here! 
Oh no no no no no! Go back to Tumblr for 'normal' hehe!

 We leave the 'normal' *and* mundane shit  to the likes of the White Knights and Beta manginas who *do All* the ""normal"" stuff like 'orbiting' and oneitis *so* well , tha ... nah, they *can have* the ""normal"" shit, whilst the 'Alphas' of this world will *continue to strive to improve* meaning there's *very little* ""normal"" in the 'average alpha's' life!

 ""we"" didn't 'make' TRP,,  it's not a 'thing', it's a 'philosophy', an 'ideology' if you will, for it preaches *self improvement and understanding women* as ""the way"" to success *and* happiness with the 'fairer sex'!  And I say, Yay for TheRedPill!   

 So, whilst you are entitled to *your opinion*, I personally would rather you youngsters and your *opinions* would spend a bit more time IRL away from their keyboards **actually doing** the things that a bunch of us 'older' Red Pill'er's *have already done* (like hook up with *lots* of lovely women), and so our 'advice' is *based upon* our *experience* ,, Not our *'opinions',, which is *all* your post *is* ... you *have no experience* upoon which to base it

 I wish you kids would *think, before* you make such silly posts! And Me thinks OP is female lol, trying to ""get us to agree"" so that she can then 'believe' her 'opinions' are 'facts' and 'speak accordingly' ... please go back to Tumblr could you,, at least until you've got some 'hard core *experience* from under your belt, homie, *then* you can talk the talk, *after* you have 'walked the walk' 

TRP is an 'ideology' based upon *extensive observation and consideration of*, the 'behavior' of, the (much) larger component of female humans in western societies; and although at first glance it can appear that  *some* of these 'observations'  are quite misogynist, when they are in fact, they are *far* from being so, which becomes apparent with enough comprehension of Red Pill ideology.

  TRP is more specifically, a 'reaction' to the way that some women have begun to espouse and promote certain 'feminist misandrist' (?sp?) behaviors, particularly over the past 30 odd years,  and via such beliefs, they have subsequently nurtured *and promoted* the 'advance and fall' of the Beta Male into misery!

And the consequential advance of the Alpha male! 

 The 'average' *reasonably* good looking western females, *especially* those between the ages of 20 and 35 have become a group of 'self entitled humans, with an ""Access All Areas PussyPass"" *they all know* very well, how to use! Shit there's even a subreddit *devoted* to women *literally* getting away with murder!!   /r/PussyPass is as scary as fuck from a guys pov!  Why isn't there the male equivalent?
Why do women get this 'privilege' but the *converse* is true for men, with far too many being falsely accused of 'raping' a woman. FFS even your wife can accuse you of rape these days!

 TRP is *our way* of surviving and thriving in this crazy world we currently inhabit!

  Whilst there have always been *""natural""  'alpha males' ... *many* were unaware of *exactly what it was* that they were ""doing right"", to get the girls,

  For their friends were 'nice guys' who never got any pussy, and so, as the ''why's and wherefore's"" of the dynamics behind this were *most unclear*,,that is until a bunch of guys started giving this ""Game"" some serious thought, trying to piece together the 'rationale *behind'* the  'common female  behavior' that almost *every man had experienced* but really had no idea 'why' ,, ""she had done that!""

  TRP is an 'in depth assessment of female behavior', and together with a few thousand guys who have both, swallowed the Pill *and* experienced the effects of the stuff, it has evolved into quite a complex ideology with several 'sub-branches' of this 'ideology' the 'essence' of RP philosophy,, *including* /r/TRP and /r/askTRP' ... /r/RPwomen, and of course /r/TRP's antithesis, /r/TheBluePill etc etc 

 TRP is becoming popular *becoz it works!*, and it 'works' *becoz* it's *not wrong!*. Simple!

 Combined with subreddits like DeadBedrooms, where guys can go to *empathize with* the dudes writing about their DB's and 'compare stories' with the guys who are at their breaking point after (far too) many years of a bunch of kids, a DeadBedroom, unhaaappy wife, and a basically FUBAR *life!* ... 

  It's tragic to read about men who have been *lucky to get, some* type of sexual activity *once a year* for the *past several years!* and are *completely* Betatized* .... 

However, to see these same guys come to TRP in desperation, and then they ""swallow the Pill"", *and then their lives change for the better* as *they realize* the 'mistakes' they have been making with *their own  lives, and* the way they were treating the women in their lifes ... 

And a fair percentage come back to *thank The Red Pill*,, for giving them the *knowledge* that helped them *save* their marriage/relationship, coming back and giving detailed posts about their 'success' and how ""swallowing TRP"" changed their lives for the better! 

You *should* search '/r/askTRP' and /r/TRP for people who are ""thanking TheRedPill"" ,, there you *will find* numerous *detailed* stories of men who have 'found' TRP and have 'changed their lives' becoz of it.

"science","t5_mouw","Sure, I'd be happy to.  I've treated depression, anxiety, trauma/PTSD, self-esteem, marital issues, job performance, and quite a bit more that I'm forgetting.

I'll try to do a quick summation, although I could probably talk for about an hour about it.  The theory is that people internalize negative core beliefs due to unresolved traumas.  This can be something like a rape (e.g. I am worthless), or just failing a test and being yelled at for it (e.g. I'm a failure).  When these traumas are triggered, such as can happen right before taking a test, the feeling state (combination of cognition, emotions, and physical sensations) associated with the trauma is expressed.  For the test taker it can be anxiety, chest tightness, and thoughts about failure (e.g. I know I'm going to fail, I always do bad at tests, etc.) - very short example, but hopefully it gets the point across.

This system can affect just about anything in someone's life.  Upcoming work deadline that makes someone ""freak out"".  Getting 2nd place and beating yourself up.  Not being able to ask a girl out due to a fear of failing.   We can replace the cognition and examples with just about anything.  I am not good enough - often expressed as a people pleaser.  When I think I haven't done a good enough job at something I feel guilty/shameful, have a sinking feeling in my stomach, and think to myself ""I should have done better, it's all my fault, things are ruined, you're such an idiot"" and so on.

EMDR targets the cognitions/traumas and essentially neutralizes them.  Just because you failed at something doesn't mean you're a failure.  Just because someone wasn't happy with the result or your input doesn't mean you're not good enough.  Just because the girl turned you down doesn't mean you're a loser.

They make good money and get automatic raises regardless of performance and it's virtually impossible to fire them because of the union. Even if this person didn't get automatic raises, they routinely get great scores on reviews and have received several promotions.

I have heard of several major projects that have started and then gotten canceled months in after tons of money has already been spent.

"csgobetting","t5_2zume","Hey please calm down. First of all, like they said, Csgolounge doesnt have a huge crew of people working on the site and that is mainly because they were probably not expecting their site to become this popular. Second of all there was a huge increase recently of new betters (a couple of months ago there were like a couple thousand bets at most and now theres 10s of thousands and even 100s of thousands of items bet). This was like I said before probably a super unexpected result in which the Csgolounge admins were not prepared for. Another thing was that Steam f****d them over by immensely decreasing the inventory cap so the bots quickly became full where as before the bots had plenty of space. All these factors made it a lot more complex for the admins to handle and they are probably trying their best to fix the issue so there is no need to insult them. Don't use Csgolounge if you aren't happy with it. No need to rant about something you have no idea how hard it is to run it and insult a site that is totally free.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; Helms only restricts the use of foreign aid for abortion “as a method of family planning.”

... does the author of this web page believe that people can't read?

The full text of the Helms Amendment is :

&gt; “No foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to *motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.*”

This makes attempts to alter the law through executive fiat /drastically/ more difficult, and significantly more politically expensive.  Honestly, I'm not sure courts would accept any argument for the President to so clearly overrule the legislative branch, especially on a spending matter -- the House's power of the purse is kinda important from a checks-and-balances viewpoint -- and if they do, it'd be for standing issues rather than any tolerance for this sort of word-twisting.

So it's supposed to be a long joyride to be together, isn't it? And every night when you finally get into bed and feel the significant other so close next to you .. your instincts kick in, need for companionship through the day turns into fruitful intimacy, expression of love and gratitude for good fortune usually fruits the elevated sexual mood that leads to you-can't-get-bored-of-good kind of regular sex, (then sleep, and then next morning those pesky alarm clocks make you feel an air raid is in progress but then he/she is there, so at least life is a bit better together).

I also went through depression after service. Mostly due to being displaced from ""home"" ( it takes a while to realize home is where you make it). Another issue is that you lose the ability to make close friends or confide in others. Sure you can make a couple close friends, but after moving around so much you can easily lose the ability to make close connections, especially if you are someone who wears their heart on their sleeve. It takes a long time to rebuild that ability and this can be the most depressing period of time because you lack that close human interaction (even with a wife and kids) that is required to maintain a healthy life. Then you get into an endless cycle of feeling sorry for yourself and depression. I personally found that school made that road back a lot easier and rebuilt confidence lost in my transition to civilian life. Vets really need to look out for each other and be there when they see someone who walks their road and faces the same issues.

"MachineLearning","t5_2r3gv","Theano is awesome. If you want a framework that's 'open-ended in terms of network architecture and transfer functions', Theano is what you're looking for.

The main reason for this is that it supports automatic differentiation: you just specify your architecture and loss function in an almost declarative way, and you get the gradients for free. For me personally, this has been invaluable in experimenting with various exotic loss functions, nonlinearities and architectures.

One thing to keep in mind is that the 'building blocks' you get in Theano are not ready-made neural network layer classes, but rather symbolic function expressions that you compose into other expressions. You'll work at a slightly lower level of abstraction, but that means you also have a lot more possibilities. (That said, if you want 'plug and play' neural networks, check out pylearn2 which is built on top of Theano. I don't use that myself though, I prefer to roll my own.)

I disagree with the idea that Theano is really complicated to get the hang of. It's definitely a different way of thinking, because you have to specify your model symbolically (i.e. write down the equations like you would in a paper, essentially). But once you are in that mindset it's pretty easy to write Theano code. The effort you invest in learning this really pays off.

Theano is also in Python, and Python has a very good set of scientific computing tools.

If you're interested in convolutional neural networks in particular: Theano has a bunch of convolution implementations that vary in performance, memory usage and flexibility (legacy, cuda-convnet wrappers, experimental FFT-based convolution) and a bunch of others are being worked on (cuda-convnet2 wrappers, Caffe wrappers, new version of the FFT-based convolution with less overhead).

Lastly, while the documentation is not perfect, it is more than decent, and the developers are EXTREMELY helpful and quick to respond to any questions on the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/theano-users

I should mention that I have been using Theano for my research for a good three years, and I have limited experience with other frameworks, so I can't really provide a comparison. I have occasionally looked at some alternatives, but I've always stuck with Theano because it's the only one that has the automatic differentiation feature.","1406851547"

Very interesting!

Looking at a map, Ottawa doesn't seem all that much farther from the US border than Toronto. I suspect that Toronto's location on a peninsula meant that it could be easily cut-off from reinforcements and resupply should the US decide to besiege it. Ottawa's more interior location (still less than 50 miles from the US border!) means that, in 1800s military thinking, it was a more defensible location.","1406851547"

If Syrio was a faceless man, I doubt Ned had any idea. He probably started asking around discreetly for the best swordsman he could find in a style fitting Arya, and Syrio applied. As for why a faceless man would want the job, well, it comes with regular access to the Red Keep and keeps him close to Ned, which would be Handy for all sorts of espionage.

As for evidence, there's this bit, the first time Jaqen talks to Arya:
&gt;“A man does not choose his companions in the black cells,” the handsome one with the red-and-white hair said. Something about the way he talked reminded her of Syrio; it was the same, yet different too.

This could be explained by Jaqen being from Lorath, which is near Braavos and may have a similar accent, but I think it seems more meaningful than that.","1406851552"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","So we're all just a bunch of crass, cynical assholes then? That's what international politics has come down to in the age of bigotry and political realism (the fucking irony of the two terms used in the same goddamn sentence)?

Ideally there shouldn't be a nation alive without the consent of the people, who give power to the ruling or governing strata (both contextually via contrast, such as in an oligarchy, and with direct economic benefit via taxation, economic infrastructure, and the like). And what we have here are multiple nations with multiple protests against an action that's either in their own back yard (in the case of the Israeli protests, no matter how small a minority those people are), or that their government refuses to step in and stop.

This isn't how it's supposed to be. End of story.

Even if we don't elect politicians, we keep their heads on because they're doing their jobs. The instability in Africa and the Middle East is testament to what happen when a populace is denied their right to remove their endowed power. Now we have bad people killing bad people, and no one wants to stop it, even our bad guys. 

For fuck's sake, this is ass backwards. If we can't get Obama to throw his chips in (in my case)--if we can't get congress to approve counter measures for the current Hamas/IDF conflict--we should find another president, if indeed that is the majority consensus. We should find another congress.

Then we have the theater that is international affairs. ""You've sinned, so don't condemn me."" But in saying that, you admit sin? Each crown fucks over backwards because its people demand it to--don't misunderstand, but if you realize that you are offing innocent children, the goddamn conversation should end there. Your blood does NOT FUCKING COST MORE than another human beings. Fuck Hamas. Fuck the Israeli government. Fuck my goddamn government if they can't even represent my motherfucking views.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","The main difference between DOCSIS 2 and DOCSIS 3 standard cable modems is that DOCSIS 3 allows for a much higher maximum throughput. DOCSIS 3.0 achieves that by using multi-channel bonding (using multiple channels simultaneously for download/upload) while DOCSIS 2 modems do not. A Docsis 3 modem with 4 bonded channels, for example would provide 4 times the bandwidth of a Docsis 2 modem.

Some other technical differences:

* Docsis 3.0 supports QAM128 for upstream traffic, while many DOCSIS 2 support only QAM64 

* Docsis 3.0 specs use 108Mhz to 1.002Ghz downstream, 5Mhz to 85Mhz upstream.

* Docsis 2.0 specs use 88Mhz to 860Mhz downstream, 5Mhz to 42Mhz upstream.

Changing to a DOCSIS 3 capable modem isn't going to change your maximum speed up, down or
sideways, only subscribing to an upgraded tier will. However, DOCSIS 3 has the ability to use multiple downstream and upstream channels at the same time (channel bonding) to maintain the maximum possible speed. Because of this, DOCSIS 3 may experience less of a speed drop during peak usage hours vs. a DOCSIS 2 modem. The D3 modem, depending on how new it is and how many channels the ISP makes available, has access to 2x-8x more bandwidth than a D2 modem, allowing for a somewhat more consistent connection.

I don't know about the specific weights of the paper, but I do now you don't want to use stuff that's too thin (newspaper, tissue paper) or too thick (cardstock). Basically you want paper that will curl without creasing and hold a curl. Printer paper is ideal. You may want to use multiple colors, though, in which case construction paper is perfect.  

You can absolutely cut your own. I do find to save on time it's better to use one of those paper slicers, because the measurements have to be exact on all the strips. You could use a ruler to mark on the paper where you want to cut (standard is 1/8th of an inch thick) and cut by hand, but you'd be there for a while. 

beginners can use BBQ skewers, especially for getting the tiny drops of glue to pick up and apply, but ideally you want something smaller or with a slit. One cool idea I heard once was buying needles with a large eye, using wire cutters on the tip of the eye-hole leaving the slit exposed, then gluing the needle into a wine cork or something equally handleable. 

Baically you want the tool to be thin so that the innermost curl of the paper is small. *Generally* speaking, the smaller that first/inside curl, the prettier the piece. The slit also helps keep the paper in place while you're spinning it. ","1406851560"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; The issue I have with that, is you're being too sensitive

Except I'm not sensitive, I really couldn't care less that you're trying to say I'm soft either. Also you don't get to tell me what I need to get over, you don't have that kind of power. Never once did I say that no one should ever say anything *slightly mean*, and I've not tried to force anyone to try to get along, so **you** are the one putting words in *my* mouth. If you garnered that from my post history, I was simply expressing a desire for men and women to get along and not have a gender-war, is that belief really so wrong that you need to shape it out to seem like I'm fucked up for wanting that?

&gt;My opinion on that directly, is if you can blow off physical abuse from some strangers on a street, why would you take mental abuse to heart?

You don't seem to grasp the fact that getting hit by someone on the street is completely different than being silently abused in the safety of your own home by someone you trust. ( as per your own example, we're going by )

The first thing is that with a stranger you're more likely to just be surprised that someone hurt you physically. It's a stranger, there really isn't much there to be hurt mentally by. Someone threw a glass bottle at my head when I was a kid walking down the road. It hurt, but it healed, and all I took away from it was "" Some people can be assholes I guess "".

But a spouse or parent abusing you in your own home? That isn't even about physical pain anymore. It's well beyond that, now it becomes mental abuse because of the confusion and horror of someone you know and love doing something sinister to you. I feel I should stress again that it isn't about the pain, it's about the loss of security, the unfamiliarity of this loved one now putting fear into you. This is all emotional and mental, pain doesn't even factor in or come close to the lasting vestiges of mental pain. And if it sounds like I'm speaking from memory or experience, it might be because I am.

And if you're gonna bring up an example like a parent beating their child, you missed the fact that while they do get hit by their parent, the lasting mental shock isn't because of the pain, it's because the parent did something so abnormal and emotionally alarming.

The physical pain of such an act really has no bearing because to the child, what is fucked up is their parent doing something like that. The pain fades, but they will always wonder *why* their parent did that, and that is the emotional trauma of it all.


For what it's worth, I'm sorry you did have to go through being picked on as a kid.","1406851562"

2. The gas has probably gone bad (think lawnmower gas going bad over a winter). A drain and refill is necessary. Draining the fuel tank probably isn't easy in that car. Perhaps someone else can chime in.

3. Oil, change it. Filter too. Inspect the engine compartment and make sure no critters have made a home in there. Pull your air filter as well. Check the accessory belts for damage. Your brake rotors may have rusted and be pitted, if this is the case they should be replaced and you should not drive on them. Check tire pressures. Your parking brake may be stuck/rusted into place (if the car doesn't move in gear, this is why), alternatively it'll make a huge cracking noise when you try to move it. This may prevent it from rolling.

And the average dieter will not even reach ketosis because it is difficult to maintain a sub-100 gram carbohydrate diet without conscious effort.

To clarify.  I said this originally, a person without diabetes does not become ketoacidotic because they still secrete insulin which limits ketone production.  I have consciously expended the effort to be on a keto diet for 10 years.  I've been in ketosis for that long if not longer.  But, no an average dieter will not be in ketosis because they are eating more than 100 g carbs. ","1406851566"

How does his argument for this fail?  

&gt;it's sensible to call that God

It's sensible to call that God, because it has the characteristics that we traditionally ascribe to God, as Aquinas argues for the next few hundred pages.  

&gt;we shouldn't call this 'subatomic particle X' or 'spacefoam' or something equally wonky.

You can call it whatever you'd like, the fact remains that it is the same God as that talked about in the Bible.  

&gt;Where besides bias is the reasoning to call it a mind?

Thomas's arguments for this are found on literally the next page of the *Summa*.  What's more, the first way demonstrates that God is not a body, and the fifth that He is a mind.  If you don't grasp this, you simply do not understand the Five Ways.  Any beginner's guide to Thomism will bear me out.

No kidding. Like I said, it doesn't happen frequently. Unless you're abusing the system banks are happy to reverse fraudulent charges and then continue to provide banking services. 

Again, you just mentioned these random, supposedly common ""account closures"" as some kind of pro-bitcoin bullet point even though, in reality, it practically never happens. 

&gt;so maybe they could corroborate your claim

You're the one who made a claim, a claim you can't back up with data. 

Cheers dude. I hope in the future you're a little less hyperbolic. Consumers pay fees and banks provide much-requested consumer protection features, that's how banking works. They don't randomly close accounts when you're a victim of fraud.

Welcome back!

I've been wanting to play Garry's Mod. I want it because I have many friends who play it and they all tell me that I should get it so that we can all play together.

[My Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046356101)

[Garry's Mod page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/)

I posted [my request](http://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/2cadol/requeststeam_garrys_mod_999/) 4 hours after you posted this. Sorry if that means I don't qualify and have wasted your time reading this.

The last game I was gifted is Super Hexagon. I didn't ask for it, but someone gifted it to me. It wasn't through a gifting subreddit. It was in /r/mlplounge. I tried it out and found out it's not my type of game. If I could give it away I would happily do so. I'll probably play it more since I was gifted it. I don't want that to go to waste.

As I said in my request, I take long breaks from Steam so a PM or comment on reddit is the best way to notify me.

EDIT

Your giveaway reminded me of Super Hexagon so I decided to play it more. Now I can't quit playing it. I guess I didn't play it enough before to really know if I like it. Thanks!","1406851571"

You are far from the only one who finds this concerning, as indicated by the way this clause is introduced in the article and obviously from the number of replies you are getting saying you are not the only one. 

On the other hand, campus judiciary policies are not bound by the same standards as courts of law. Students can be sanctioned for underage drinking, smoking on campus, cheating, etc. based on evidence that would probably not hold muster in a criminal court. Expulsion for these offenses can also ""ruin someone's life"" and make it incredibly difficult to finish college, pursue further education, and find employment. ","1406851571"

This is the upper peninsula of the continent my players are starting on--one of four continents in the realm of Ellysia. Feel free to offer any questions you have! Questions are great--they are though provoking and lead me to new ideas.

The capital city of Fallreach is located on the island in the middle. The bottom is a desert/wasteland (called ""The Badlands"" for now). Probably the site of an ancient war. Nomads and refugees live in the pseudo-post-apocalyptic rubble you see in the bottom. Still working out lots of the details, but it was fun to see how ideas came as I created the map, instead of the other way around.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to add in rivers. I don't know if I should just dark lines to represent them, or actually ""build"" them into the terrain.

I also noticed that the region on the middle-left looks ambiguous. I wanted it to look like hills, but my friend thought it was a marsh.

Lastly, I've never really studied geography and how it influences terrain and weather systems. I want my map to be reasonably realistic (though I will be certainly attributing any lack of realism to magic and fantasy mumbo-jumbo). That said, how does it look so far?","1406851571"

A crock pot meal, left alone, will be fine spending half the day on your counter. Hell, if you've got that type of timer, you can control when it turns on and off -- and that would make it easy to have your food ready just before you get home.

Combine that with a SqlRoleProvider to control the user roles.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","As a rank 7 Zhong Kiwi, I can confirm he is viable... Just gotta have the right build, here is what I do for his item build:


Vampiric Shroud

Warlock's Sash (make sure to rush this so you can get the stacks ASAP)

Boots/Bancroft's Talon (depending on how your doing really, and get boots of magic over focus, sure the CD is nice but I always lean towards penetraion on damage heavy gods like him)

Whichever item you didn't grab as your next item (so if you got boots get talon and vice versa)

Etheral Staff

Gem of Isolation

Sell Vampiric Shroud and get Rod of Tahuti

Actives are dependent on scenario

This build just gives you a shit ton of health and some pretty solid power to boot, let's you be a bruiser mage of sorts, especially with you passive giving you stacks of protection that doubles when you ult.

At least that's what I do anyhow... and it works wonders in any mode really, just be wary of teammates that like to kill minions before you get any stacks...","1406851575"

Just think, media outlets are a business. A business that generates profit based on number of viewers, listeners and readers.

As for the rape victims that are vulnerable to cat calling, your solution is to circle jerk about ""microaggressions"" and encourage people to remain victims. The only possible solution that could be reached using your thought process is that the whole world will change because people's feelings get hurt, and suddenly everyone will be nice and polite to each other.

As realistic as that is, a more effective route may be to help rape victims come to terms with what happened and learn to continue their life without it controlling them. Encouraging someone to remain in that victim mentality effectively cripples them to the point where they cannot function in the real world. As I've said over and over again, it is our responsibility to deal with our own experiences and feelings, the world isn't going to change for you.

As someone who has not only known many rape victims, but has had some pretty negative experiences myself, I've seen what happens when people with real problems allow those issues to control their lives, and thats where my disgust with people encouraging your thought process comes from. Forget encouraging strength and giving people a chance at a real life, stay a victim.","1406851578"

  (live aboard diving 3 days http://www.mikeball.com/ I think...  Make reservations in advance! , 4th day in Port Douglas)

- 3 Days in Sydney 
  (stayed with friends, friends took me around, Taronga zoo, Bondi beach, Opera house, The Quay )

- 3 Days in Melbourne 
  (stayed with friends.  Love the lanes.  Went to Phillips Island to see some penguins, wineries, friends took me around except last day.  Used a friends car to drive along the golden coast to see the 12 apostles)

- 2 days in Auckland
  ( A friend took us around, had great time.  Mt. Eden, Sky City, sheeps.  All great fun!  if you have time, you can try zorbing, but that's further outside of the city).

- 1 day in Christchurch (city was still devastated.  Hotels and Motels are different.  Motels &amp; B&amp;B close after 6pm.  Hotels are 24 hours.  At the time, only 4 hotels were left standing even years after the earthquake.  Dirve outside the city, its beautiful.  

- 1 Day driving to Queenstown (scenic drive.  Worth it!  Lots of beautiful lakes and mountains)

- 3 days in Queenstown.  Went to wineries, bungie jumping off the original place of bungie jumping, and can't miss Jetboating.  Super fun!

Then back home...

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Okay very serious here, we have a similar issue with bees. We have a hive in the corner of the house that is around 12 or so years old. My dad has tried to find someone to take them but no luck and killing them would not only be bad for well them, but we were told the honey in the hive would seep through the walls and such with no bees up keeping it. I can snap some pictures tomorrow if need be if anyone has any suggestions here....

*Editing to add*: My dad said that he has talked to various bee keepers and exterminators. No one is willing to helps us out because you would have to use a ladder to get to them. But not only that, no one is willing to really tear part of the house to get to the hive, which is probably an insane size considering how long it has been there. :/ I told my dad about this post, showed him the pictures but he just huffed and said it was a curse we will have to just deal with. :/ So I don't know...I know the power of Reddit can be a wondrous thing, so if we can save the bees, relocate them without costing an insane amount of money and from tearing our house down, that would be wonderful. 

Photos. They are Dark sorry :(  I will post more tomorrow when it is brighter and they are more active. But the entrance is the corner.

You should also consider applying for internships as well. They are generally full-time and pay well. A firm may be more willing to try you out rather than extend a full-time offer.

The CPA reimbursement depends on the firm. Not all firms offer it and from my experience those that do, only offer to cover costs incurred after you sign your offer. When you go through the process I would definitely ask about what study materials are offered and what costs are reimbursed as well as if there is a passing bonus. ","1406851591"

"bad_religion","t5_2yu3u","Deary me I've seen someone exactly like this guy before. Completely unable to grasp basic theological concepts. In fact, the guy I knew used the exact same arguments in some place. For a start:

&gt;Can a non-physical being interact with a physical world? Can you cite any verified entity capable of such?

This is just ridiculous. The idea of the Christian God is that he is omnipotent, thus meaning nothing is beyond his reach. Therefore, interacting with the ""physical world"" which he actually made would hardly be an issue. Also, asking for a verified entity capable of such is ridiculous. I assume that he sees ""verified"" as ""verified by science"". Seeing as science is the study of the natural, it is impossible for something non-physical (i.e. supernatural) to be verified by science, so obviously there is no example.

&gt;If it's your intention to argue what I believe then it's futile. I don't believe a god exists, so there's no god or property of it that I subscribe to that you can argue about.

DAE non-belief doesn't need defending?

&gt;What you fail to address is that there is as much verifiable evidence for a god's existence as there is verifiable evidence for a unicorn's existence or a leprechaun's existence or bigfoot or fairies or Greek gods or ghosts etc

This is also completely ridiculous. As stated earlier, claiming something needs ""verifiable evidence"" (something he hasn't even set a parameter for - what counts to him as verifiable evidence?) to say it exists is idiotic. Does he have any ""verifiable evidence"" (whatever that actually is - verifiable by what? the scientific method? something else?) that his belief that you need ""verifiable evidence"" to believe something exists is true? Furthermore, to compare a physical entity with defined parameters (e.g. a unicorn) to a non-physical entity with undefined parameters (i.e. God) is ridiculous. I don't believe in unicorns because, if they were to exist, they would be a distinct physical object which we could see. God is a supernatural non-physical omnipotent being. Not only does this mean that he is beyond our boundaries of scientific testing, unlike a unicorn, but also philosophical arguments can be used for his existence that can't be used for other beings due to his omnipotent properties. For example, the Kalam Cosmological Argument can apply to God as, in line with the argument, the only thing that could have created the universe in an omnipotent being so it exists. You can hardly use this argument with a unicorn as it is hardly a preset for the existence of the universe.

&gt;I'm arguing against the existence of any god in general, not just one.

This is also ridiculous. He is trying to apply ""universal"" arguments to the concept of ""God"" in general. Well how does that work? Arguments you would use for pantheism for example would vastly differ from those for monotheism. The traditional stance of atheists is to argue against the Abrahamic God, yet this guy is trying to apply his arguments to all gods in general. That is just ridiculous. That's like trying to disprove the existence of all fruit by disproving oranges exist.

&gt;I'm not going to assume what you believe about your god. I'm here to argue what you say you believe. 

How the heck can you enter an argument before you even know what the argument is. So this guy committed himself to an argument without having an assumption of what your belief of God was. How can he disagree if he doesn't even have some idea of what his opponent thinks? He is disagreeing before he even knows his opponents beliefs?","1406851592"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; All theoretical. We have no idea what we happen in a ground offensive against the United States. The Chinese have a bigger army, for example, which would be relevant when it comes to a ground invasion.

The United States also has nuclear weapons closer to China than China has nuclear weapons close to America. No ground offensive can be won against any of the nuclear powers, unless you count mutually assured destruction as victory.

&gt; Anyway, let's talk about facts You're saying when ""America chooses to ruin you"" it happens. But is that true? Have we stamped out anti-Americanism and Islamic extremism in the middle east after it cost 3,000 American lives? Not even close. We've only made it worse. We're not winning these guerilla wars. We lost in Vietnam. We lost in Iraq (twice). We haven't won a conflict since WWII, besides taking out Hussein and Bin Laden, who were individuals, not armies.

I am talking about the cost of winning against America. America can't hold any territory for itself, so, theoretically, a defensive war against America is a waiting game. After winning a war against America, America has to deal with debt and war exhaustion. The winner of the war has to deal with massive civilian deaths, a patchwork of a government, and destroyed infrastructure. It may be impossible to win against sustained guerrilla resistance, as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan shows, but it's impossible to prevent mass destruction, as the creation of a power vacuum from U.S destruction in the middle east showed. 

Anyhow, if you don't believe the States is the strongest military power, who is? Al Qaeda isn't. China and Russia don't have the aircraft, widespread military bases in other people's territory, or navy to equal to America.

Don't go out to eat, don't party and just learn the city at first. When you get a job you can go out and do things, it's really important to be fruggle at first. Get a library card too. It's a cheap way to get books and have a place to use internet, read the newspaper and what not. Getting a job shouldn't be too hard, I think Seattle has pretty decent employment numbers and if you're willing to do anything you'll do well.

It's also very key to try to be as social as much as you can. We ended up meeting with folks that went to our university and through them met some great friends.

Totally false, he had plenty of time. 

 At this time, this thread is sixteen hours old, same as the comment asking for examples. Interestingly, OPs first replies (which are also 16 hours old) do not address the comment requesting examples. The earliest sarcastic comment is 12 hours old. 

He had four full hours during which he was aware of and ignoring the request for examples before the fun began. Plenty of time to me.

Most embarrassingly, he *still* hasn't obliged the request for a modicum of evidence or example to support these... overstated... accusations. 

I think we all have a sense of what he's talking about. Posters here are not worried about stepping on toes. And to paraphrase Dawkins, people mistake clarity for rudeness. But ""harassment""? 

If he could link to specific example we would be able to condemn or defend the ostensible belligerents in his experience. But no. Why not? (SPOILER ALERT: he knows he's making a mountain out of a mole hill)","1406851599"

It's not very common for these to be the reason for tinnitus but hey, even that sliver of hope is worth seeing a doctor.

Also, please do look at TRT.  It's considered something of a last resort.  Or at least something to try after say, 6 months of living with the condition if you aren't habituating naturally.  There are some supplements that people have had success with.  I don't personally use them but I've heard that magnesium is helpful as well as melatonin as a sleep aid.

As great as Reddit is I'd check out the Tinnitus Talk message board.  I'm active over there as well and they have much more useful knowledge with regards to living with the condition and potential treatments.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Though I love the movies, I have to oppose your view that the books are, in any fashion, ""bad"". I don't really think they can be compared objectively, but I will make objective arguments that the books are good literature.

All you've stated in the arguments in your post and comments is that you don't favor Tolkien's style. You seem to speak for ""many,"" which is a huge red flag. Let me see your data. In the absence of data, I'll match you anecdote for anecdote. Writing people off as ""fanboys"" is an empty argument. Your opinion is not more or less valid than theirs.

- Tolkien took decades to build his universe, developing a mythology, a pantheon of deities, a creation myth, numerous languages, cultures, eras, catastrophes, wars, etc. That's true dedication to his work. He built a world and then became its scholar for the rest of us. It's not just entertainment, it's a life's work inspired by Tolkien's decades of research into humanity's most treasured works of fiction. Virtually all ""worldbuilders"" out there draw some inspiration from his example.

- Tolkien tested the continuity and coherence of his stories. He didn't just want to tell a story with a big background. He didn't just slap on ""plot armor"" to build up pages or add empty conflict. Every story has a purpose and contributes to the plot of the main story (LotR) and the background. Every story was written, scrapped and re-written numerous times to achieve meaningful cohesion and give purpose to his character's actions. You can see this in segments like the council of Elrond, or the Houses of Healing, or in Rohan just before Gandalf rides out to Minas Tirith (about the Palantir and the reveal of Aaragorn to Sauron), or the essay ""on the Istari"". Tolkien directly addresses what might be perceived as plot holes right in the middle of the books.

- Tolkien's characters have much more depth, purpose and sincerity in the books than in the movies. Don't get me wrong - the movies tell a great story with great actors, but each character is much less than they are in the books. This is not just a matter of pages written or meaningless depth. All of their full stories provide motive and give you insight into their mind. You can step into their shoes and not just see what Tolkien gave them to do, but why. Many people value that ability of an author to force you to empathize with their characters.

- Tolkien's prose and writing style can be hard to parse at times, but it adds gravitas to the story which might otherwise have been fact dumps. It's not enough to say ""son of"" 50 times in a row. Aragorn's lineage has many characters with their own stories, such as Elros, the founder of Numenor (and brother of Elrond, which explains why Aragorn and Elrond are so close), and Earendil, Beren and Luthien, etc. All of their stories exist, in full literature form, to give Aragorn a deeper purpose and a much heavier burden of duty and honor than he would otherwise have as ""a ranger from the north"" or ""a guy who wants to be king.""

- The themes are universal. This is true of so much great literature. I could list them all here, but suffice it to say that there are parables in the story applicable to decisions I make every day, that feed into who I am as a person and have changed my ethos. Bad books don't do that to me.

- People love it. They read scraps of notes they find for the tiniest morsel of additional insight. They read letters he wrote to fans. His son took up his labor after him, compiling untold stories from his notebooks and people wanted it. They ate it up. Bad authors don't inspire that kind of interest.

- Only rare characters do not have some form of character development. Even minor characters that merely have one on-screen shot in the movie have histories of great deeds. Readers of the books appreciated the presence of the characters in the movie, despite their lack of a role simply because Tolkien made it a point not to put empty shells of people in his world. Even the most evil characters have good, the greatest have weaknesses and the least significant, a meaningful effect on significant characters. All of those qualities feed into the character.

You may not value these things, but so few of these excellent qualities of Tolkien's literature can be observed in other books, even truly enjoyable and powerful stories.","1406851605"

I also think, despite what an asshole he can be, he likes taking care of people, which is why he always giving backrubs and supporting Frankie and such.

I see it as more of a playful thing, I mean he's made it explicitly clear he's straight. His family did a Skype interview about it and they were saying what we're seeing is an exact product of how he was raised...100% comfortable with gay people, and also very affectionate with friends.

Keep in mind though it's nearly impossible to overcook something in a slowcooker! I definitely know what you mean, especially in the case of veggies, but I've never found it to happen in a slowcooker. Probably because of the moist cooking environment, plus the low temp.

Recipes:

I've also just tossed in red and green peppers, chicken breast, sausage (optional, of course!), with some Cajun spice and/or hot sauce and tomato sauce. I think it usually ends up being 4-6 hours on high or 8-10 on low, I usually just cut open a piece of chicken to check. Serve over rice, and you've got a killer jambalaya :)

&gt; *""Une immense espèrance a traverser la terre""*

&gt; *""Une immense espèrance a traverser ma peur""*

I only had basic french in high school but with Google Translate's help I'm sure it's along the lines of:

&gt;*""A great hope to overcome (or cross) the earth (or the land)""*

&gt;*""A great hope to overcome my fear""*

Music interpretation is entirely subjective of course, but I think the first is about wanting to leave the past behind, and to move on, which corresponds to the constant running in the video.
 
The second one seems to correspond to the end where he lights himself on fire, as he stops fearfully running and almost gladly seems to welcome the burning arrows which are going to light him on fire. 

Anyways the above is just my interpretation, see whether you agree, and let me hear what you think of the song, or song video. I really like both! ","1406851610"

If you listen to actors talk about theater vs. movies, you'll realize they're very different.  Some of the skills are different (like being able to remember ALL your lines at all times), as are the work schedules and such.  Alec Baldwin talked quite a bit about theater vs. movies vs. tv shows on his podcast.

My point with all that is to say that suggesting a career change isn't the answer to celebrities who don't like the attention they receive in public.

&gt;However, part of the job (if you want to work towards the very top) is being known by many, and if you are known, people will want to know you and a few might want a photo with you because they think what you do is wonderful.

Yes, and I'd like to have sex with this stripper at the local strip club, but I don't ask her if we can hang out outside the strip club because that's against social etiquette.  It's only socially acceptable to approach celebrities and ask for or demand their attention because it's been deemed socially acceptable by our general populace (very often against the wishes of said celebrities).

Also, my point about some celebrities being famously private is that many don't want the attention, as you suggested.

"NoPoo","t5_2sej3","I have been using ""nopoo"" for about a year so far (I didn't even know there was a sub for it until today) but I have two suggestions for to get the sand out.
1. Baking soda wash - I use baking soda and water as my ""shampoo"" about every 3-5 days and that works to clean most of the stuff out. Use like 1:8 or 1:10 ratio of baking soda to water (add more if your hair is oily, less if it's too dry). I would recommend making it on a cup since you have short hair, I use a water bottle of it. Just pour it through your hair and move it around a bit and rinse. You can add essential oils (like lavender, mint, etc) if you want some smell to it.
2. Apple cider vinegar wash - if you are a ""nopoo"" purest this is the best thing to do. It helps remove everything from your hair, including chemicals, I work at a pool and use it to get rid of chlorine. Use 1:4 or 1:3 ratio depending on how strong you want it. Make it in a water bottle, pour through your hair, let it sit for at least two minutes and rinse with COLD water. The cold water will lock in the nutrients and help prevent split ends.

I think often times moms that are thrown into motherhood sometimes miss their kid free life, even if they love their kids I think it's a normal feeling and sometimes they might feel guilty for feeling that way.

When I had my kid, which was unplanned, I felt so guilty for wanting to be kid free just one night. Then my mom would offer to babysit over night so I could have a date night or rest and we would just end up talking about our baby the whole damn night! Lol.","1406851616"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I was a bridesmaid at my friends wedding. She lives in CT and so does the maid of honor. The rest of us lived out of state. The maid of honor was actually out of state in school but swore she could take care of the plans. 

One of the other bridesmaids and I kept asking to help. It would be great if one of us did the favors or invitations, but she refused. I kept suggesting we go to a restaurant because it would be easier since we were all out of state. Again she said no, but offered no alternative. 

Eventually I get the invitation, which is just printed on basic white paper and hand addressed. It's at the brides parents house in a small town way off the beaten path. No directions included. And the MOH made it say she was the host, no mention of the other bridesmaids or parents. 

I had to get a list of the invitees, call the bride to get directions, then mail or email them out. 

A week before the shower I called the MOH to check in. She has no plans for food or dessert. So I called the local supermarket and ordered party platters and cake. The morning of the shower I drive down super early so I could pick up food, plates, utensils, and drinks. 

Come to find out, the MOH asked if we could have the shower there. The bride had wanted it in a restaurant and so had her parents. The parents had rented a tent, tables, and chairs and paid for it themselves because the MOH assumed it would be indoors. 

So in the end, the only thing the MOH did was send out incomplete invitations. She even got her mom to make shitty favors. 

The other bridesmaids and I pooled our money and sent the parents a thank you card and a gift card to their favorite restaurant for all their help. The MOH thought it was stupid and didn't participate. ","1406851618"

If you're not interested in preachy stuff, skip to ""Delight and Wonder"" on the second page and read until ""Ministering to Scientists"" on the third to last page; yes, you'll see ""Christian"" and ""church"" in the remaining text, but I promise it can be generalized.

It's calibrated for people talking to scientists, but I bet a lot of what this guy is talking about will also be relevant to the sorts of pressures and privileges a faculty member in any field will face.  It's somewhat quiet about the sort of day-to-day pressures a professor deals with, but I think it's definitely wonderful at talking about the things that motivate a career in academia in the first place (""Delight and Wonder"") and what pressures we're always constantly, keenly aware of (""Isolation"" is particularly relevant to the significant others of scientists, I think, as you have a lot of control over how much interaction we have with the ""real world"").","1406851621"

The interactions that the characters have are individually very interesting but occur on a boring background and are ultimately void of any relation or meaning.

For me I didn't leave the movie thinking of anything provoking or satisfied with the characters. Everything seems meaningless. The movie seems like a snapshot of a particular location in a particular era but lacking any form of compelling story. What am I missing here?

"Switzerland","t5_2qhp6","Too bad that we already export all the good souvenirs all over the world. It would be hard to find something that you couldn't find in the US as well.

That said, I'd still get a nice Swiss Army Knife (Victorinox). Either a small one to carry around everywhere (~18$) or one of the regular large ones (~30$). They are really nicely built and last forever. I use mine all the time. Prices are about the same everywhere, you can even get a small selection at the local supermarkets.

If you need a watch, Swatch makes good cheap ones starting at ~40$. While they are not Omega/Rolex/etc. the quality is good and they do last. I don't think you could get higher quality at that price.

If you like peeling vegetables or potatoes, you can get the best peeler in the world for just CHF 1.90. [Some guy became a millionaire](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1sym2i/interview_with_joe_ades_who_became_a_millionaire/) selling these in New York for 5$ each. Just note: You'll want the [original one](http://imgur.com/Ge39vT5) from Migros or Globus, not any of the Chinese knockoffs (which funnily enough, are more expensive). For reference: the model is [Rex, made by Zena](http://www.zena-swiss.com/de/produkte/wissenswertes/rex-sparschaeler).

Maybe you need a metal water bottle? The traditional [metal Sigg bottles](https://www.sigg.com/en_ch/content/?page=en/collections/classics/) have been around forever.

Some other Swiss things that will unfortunately not fit into your budget: [Freitag](http://www.freitag.ch/) messenger bags (made out of used truck tarp, all the rage here), and [Mammut](http://www.mammut.ch/) climbing and outdoor gear.

And of course edibles which you don't want (why, oh why!)

So while kids are eating their ice cream, or waiting in line to get it, we're chilling watching the monkeys. And monkeys do what they do, basically, crapping all over and screaming with their weird baboon scream or whatever the hell kind of monkey they were.

Anyway so now like 4 groups which were probably 2 guys 2 girls are lined up onlooking and this one monkey hops to the top of the mountain and just starts smacking his monkey dick around, and I don't know much about monkey dicks but this monkey had a pretty huge dick

So immediately some girls are crying and some are gasping like what the fuck

I feel railguns &amp; SMG's need significant nerfs to their ranged effectiveness, plasma at range is fine because of the bullet drop, and shotgun-spread.

On the off chance you decide to read on:

&gt;  But now you are stating we have to make assumptions about existence but can know things for certain. You are contradicting yourself.

It's pretty clear I'm saying those assumptions we make for daily life aren't logical. We assume they're 100% to get through the day even though they're not. Humans aren't perfectly logical.

&gt; That is just it. You can't provide evidence that something does not exist. You can only provide evidence that shows a lack of evidence. You are saying that everything is possible since it lacks evidence.

Well, yes, that's basically it. You're no different than those who claimed human flight was impossible, though I think even they at least offered reasons why.

&gt; This stance on agnostic v. gnostic is a purely philosophical argument that has no basis in reality.

Not a fan of epistemology huh? Just because something isn't practical doesn't make it bullshit.

All I'm attempting, and clearly failing, to do is outline the axioms you have and apply universally without a care with the blanket assumption that because you accept them as true, everyone should.

And the reason for bad win:loss ratios is because they are duo queuing with diamonds, therefore they get less LP per loss and more LP per win.

EDIT:

And I just looked you up on lolking.  You are another perfect example of my point.  You are plat 1 but you only play with your friend/bf whatever and he's mid-Diamond.

"Birmingham","t5_2r3nd","IIRC The usual arguments that support the ""its difficult to get ID's"" are that people don't have a job they can take a day off and go get an ID, or that they live so far away from the building that could give them an ID that its financially not feasible for them (its $23.50 for the card), or that they can't afford the money to get an ID. 

Personally I doubt there are that many people these arguments apply to (maybe a few hundred), although the law should be amended that if its a requirement to have the ID to vote, then it should be free to get an ID.  Hell I'd even be fine with a subsidy going to a business for people that have to take the day off and make below a certain threshold.

I'm honestly not sure how anyone can survive in the US without an ID without being completely off the grid.  In order to get an apartment, buy a home, get almost any job, or get any government service you need one.  And most people who have the kind of job where the boss would fire you for getting an ID probably aren't making much more than they would get by being on SS or any other program, (and if you got the job without an ID I'm not sure said employee isn't working in a sweat shop that needs to be put out of business)","1406851635"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","That is non sequitur to what is being discussed.

We *know* that Neanderthals interbred with Homo sapiens and that all non-Africans are the products of this interbreeding (so this includes me, for example).  The fact that we had larger social groups means that the actual average amount of Neanderthal genes in any given non-African individual today is now about 1.2%.  Group conflicts don't really enter in this analysis.

What the headline is saying is that this 1.2% comes from 20% of the available pool of differentiated genes from Neanderthal.  Now, there are easy explanations for why some Neanderthal genes might be removed from the surviving gene representation.  If the genes correspond to a trait that was inferior to a Homo sapien version, for example, then normal natural selection will cause that gene to disappear over time.

But what is being claimed is that only 20% of the differing Neanderthal genes have survived long term in people today.  So 80% of Neanderthal genes were weeded out somehow.  If the differentiated genes were that bad, then how was interbreeding successful at all?  So that's why this is a puzzling revelation to me.","1406851639"

* Try to use the language. Whether it's through this subreddit, or if you find a Skype partner to do a language exchange, you must use the language. 

* Have a definite goal, something for you to work towards in the short/medium term to motivate you to practice. It needs to be something concrete, rather than the amorphous ""get better"". I am learning German so I can talk to her when I see her in another couple months. I also have shorter goals, such as specific issues that I want to focus on.

* Don't use flashcards. Instead use SRS. I use Memrise, and I'm a big fan of Anki as well. I understand there is another option for Mac, but I'm unfamiliar with it.


I have to say, I'm still learning German, I'm still a beginner, but I'm very happy with this approach so far. It works for me, so find something that works for you and include it in your practice regimen. \^o^","1406851640"

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","""Conjuration"" is a broad term given for the magical creation or summoning of objects or creatures. Necromantic conjurations, as you mention, are summoning magics which call forth undead creatures from the Soul Cairn, which is a minor plane, the ""location"" of which (Oblivion, Aetherius, etc.) I am not entirely sure. Various daedric conjurations summon daedra from various Oblivion plane(t)s. Spriggans, bears, etc. are summoned from the plane(t) of Nirn. I believe that animal familiar conjurations are creation magics which form Aetheric energies into solid shapes with a temporary animus. Most conjurations have a component which binds the summoned/created creatures to the caster's will.

It's also important to understand that schools of magic are not written in the fabric of reality. They are an academic system of categorization which may, at some times, fall short of accounting for every little detail. Spells may occasionally be shoved under an umbrella because the classifier had nowhere else to put them. The disowning of Mysticism after the Guild of Mages disbanded caused Soul Trapping to be shoved under the umbrella of Conjuration, even if it doesn't wholly fit there. Shielding magics were put into Restoration, telekinesis was put into Alteration. Teleportation was ostensibly banned, but if it wasn't, and it made an appearance in Skyrim, it would probably have been labeled Alteration or Conjuration. ""Necromancy"", in its pure form of animating and binding the undead, as opposed to the summoning of preanimated and prebound undead from the Soul Cairn, was its own school of magic. When the player was finally given the ability to do it him/herself, it was shoved into Conjuration. It happens.","1406851642"

However, in this particular outbreak, it's typically been the case that the worst-hit areas are rural, with dense urban areas doing surprisingly well.

This is because ebola is the sort of disease which can really only reach epidemic levels if the population it's spreading through doesn't understand what they're dealing with. Unfortunately, that's been the case throughout many of the rural areas in this recent outbreak, with the local people engaging in traditional practices of caring for their sick and deceased which lead to a much higher rate of disease transmission. Not to mention the fact that they are often [very distrustful of the health care workers](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/world/africa/ebola-epidemic-west-africa-guinea.html) who've come to help, sometimes even attacking them.","1406851643"

&gt;
&gt;The OP appears to be a copy/paste from a forum reply on MMO-Champion, which is unfortunate as almost everything listed is just incorrect, if not intentionally misleading. Reading it I'm tempted to say it's a well crafted troll because ... I'll say: because of the outlandishness of some of the claims, but the fact that it has so many upvotes here tells me that either people didn't read it, or they're agreeing with something that promotes their general feeling without counting on any of the specific points being made.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Being wary of a feature or direction is absolutely warranted, being unhappy or even upset about something is something we want to know about, providing feedback and telling us how you feel about something is critical to us so we can create an excellent gaming experience, but it's so absolutely important that everyone be curious, and research, and want to learn, and become knowledgeable, and use that knowledge to empower what they themselves think and say. I see a lot of people here are being critical of the points listed, which restores some of me, but so many are assuming the things they're told are true, and that's a poisonous way to ... hell, to go through *life*, let alone how to feel about a video game.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Simply repeating what someone else said is so very easy, and especially in this case, a good way to undermine your own voice. Have a voice, be critical, but do it because *you* have something to say. That is what is helpful, and that is what we want to hear.

He is in the same situation as me, broke, and has been using his 5 weight for steelhead fishing. We both got into chasing steelies last spring but due to the California drought our river was closed.

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","If A&amp;M has a bad season, they will likely lose a good number of their better recruits in the very good 2015 class they've assembled. This seems like a distinct possibility without the miraculous JFF/with an unproven QB and the strength of the schedule they have to play. Some of their best recruits seem fairly like soft commitments. If that happens and UT has a slightly better than mediocre season then it will go right back to where it was. Especially given that everyone will be allowing a year or two for Charlie to get things where he wants them in Austin. I think (and more importantly, hope) this is what will probably happen this season, although UT also has a fairly tough schedule ahead.

If A&amp;M has a good but not BCS bowl/playoff season then:

A) If Texas does mediocre or better but not stellar --&gt; Texas probably gains a little but not much

B) If Texas does poorly --&gt; A&amp;M may cool off a little in recruiting but Texas will continue to have to fight for the best recruits.

"bandmembers","t5_2sgov","You have to think from a fan's perspective. If you want your fans to stay for the other bands, play with other bands that are worth staying around for. If you just want the people who came out to see other bands to stay for your band, make your band worth staying around for. I've seen it happen, but usually people stick around long enough to at least hear the following band assuming there isn't too much time between the sets. They don't really file out until the other band starts playing and then they judge whether they think the other band is worth sticking around for. People aren't going to watch a show they don't want to watch. That's why people walk out of movies. It's a waste of time. 

And you also have to understand that most of the time (I believe), fans will probably scope out the other bands before you play. So by the time they arrive at the venue, they probably know whether they'd be interested in the other bands act before they even show up. If they aren't interested, they won't stick around. 

The best way to get more people to your shows is make better music, or more make your music more appealing to a larger demographic. It's not marketing, it's not artwork, it's the quality of your product. I'm not talking production quality, I'm talking raw sound. And let's be honest, would you watch a band play you're not interested in? Maybe out of respect if you're playing the show, but even me being in a band doesn't make me want to stick around for bands I have absolutely no interest in. 

To quote field of dreams: ""If you build it, they will come"". I disagree it's disrespectful for fans to not watch everyone. It's disrespectful to judge your audience for not liking your music. Ultimately, they're the judges of whether the music is worthwhile. Otherwise, if you're playing for your own enjoyment, then it shouldn't matter if you have an audience or not. I'm not trying to be mean, this is just reality. Know your audience. If your music is only catering to a small demographic (niche music), then you're only going to get a small crowd. ","1406851652"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","&gt;To answer a few of your questions we aren't crushing it right now, because we've only had this income for about 18 months.

18 months is a long time, considering.  In that span, you've made $240,000.  Just how much credit card debt do you still have?

What does your budget look like, that even on a 160k/year salary, you can't pay off that debt, and you're paying the minimum on your student loans?  I know you're paying $2000/month for rent.  What does the rest of the picture look like?

&gt;I've also managed to put 20K in my 401K in the last 2 years.

I would strongly consider dropping the amount you put in your 401k until you get yourself back in better financial shape.  Does your employer match?  I would contribute up to the match and nothing more until you get rid of that credit card debt at a minimum.

&gt;Where I live the rent gets you a lot less for your money. That is part of why it is so painful. For the amount we spend on rent we could have a monthly mortgage/tax/hoa payment that would get us about 30% more house. 

Rental markets can only support so much upward pressure before the collapse.  Have you considered a cheaper rental until you clear out some of your debt and until you can save for a down payment?

&gt; I don't like the idea of having to pay for PMI and having a higher interest rate, but I also hate that it will take me 5+ years to get together a 20% down payment.

Would you rather rent for 4-5 years and be financially stable when you do go to buy, or would you rather buy in 2 years and be on the razors edge of affordability each month?  100k is a lot of money.  It's however not a lot of money that to someone who will make 800k over that 5 year span, not including any bonuses/raises.

If I were in your position, I would focus hard on righting my financial ship before I even consider purchasing a home.  You shouldn't be carrying any credit card debt, and like I said, should be knocking it out of the park each month on a 160k/year income.  You've been doing this for 18 months now.  You should have a firm idea of what you're bringing in each month...","1406851657"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Game of the generation is a nebulous term that can never be definitive anyhow.   The experience games can offer vary so widely that I don't think they can be directly compared.  Terms like that are just a carryover from movies, which are a consistent experience.  You watch it passively from the start to the finish.  This is a common element across all movies, no matter the genre.   I think applying it to games just doesn't really work.

With that said, as far as story-based action/adventure games where you play one or more characters interacting with a virtual 3d world with an end goal of reaching a narrative conclusion, I'd say TLOU is among the most refined.   If ""games of the generation' means it defines what that generation of games of its type can offer, I wouldn't look for something that pushed the envelope further than any other or does any one thing better than any other game.  I would look for the game that makes a cohesive whole better than any other.  

In my opinion, The Last of Us really didn't have any true weaknesses.  It has the basics down - graphics, gameplay, design, narrative.  Together, those elements bring together than experience that was immersive, accessible, adequately convincing (as far as video games go), and, well, fun!  I still think the term ""game of the generation"" is pointless, but I wouldn't fault someone for applying that term to that game.  I think it's reasonable, in that context.

I'm curious-- what exactly does ""game of the generation"" mean to you, and what game would you apply to it?  ","1406851659"

"turkishlearning","t5_2xbsq","I'm actually trying to learn Turkish and I gladly checked this course.
My first criticism would be starting with listening. I feel like moving it further would be a better idea. Especially that later you have vocab check from this first exercise and I'll be honest; I've done it purely based on my (limited) knowledge of the language. In fact for a second I thought that there's an exercise missing. Later I realised that the words were introduced at the beginning.

I very much like the vocab with pictures and pronunciation. I also noticed that on the next page, where you test new words, the pictures are placed randomly. Big fan of that. 

I also like that typing ,+c gives ç etc. I'm learning vocab on memrise and I must say, clicking the special letters was annoying to the point where I actually installed TR keyboard. Even though I do like it, I think you should incorporate it somehow on the screen where you type. Because when I go back to check how am I suppose to type special marks it erases typed in data. So that's bad.

Of course there are some problems with interface overlapping, but I suppose you know that. Also for me personally the interface itself wasn't labelled well enough. I missed that clicking on the task box closes it. I had trouble finding the way to jump between chapters in each unit, also there seems to be a problem with the arrow that takes you to the main menu. It seems like in some tasks it doesn't work (e.g. unite 2; language activities; task 1 to 4.

Speaking of task four. Card task, I don't understand why it's there.

Now one thing that stuck out, which is a problem I see everywhere. Translations. I especially noticed it with *güzel*. It was one of the first words I learned in Turkish and it was taught to me as *beautiful*, but in your course it is *excellent*. Now I realise that some words can have two different meanings I just think explaining this would be useful to avoid any misunderstandings. Also *Çok* of course being *very*, this I already know, but why in conjunction with güzel it changes güzel's meaning to *nice*. And again I was told by an native speaker that *çok güzel* means *very beautiful*. So maybe adding more information to the glossary on different translations and uses.

Well I hope this turns out useful in some way.

All the forced wiggling and the bad combat controls with the sword and bowling moves with bombs are bad and force me to sit in one straight position or else I fuck up a lot of times. I can't really relax playing it and combat is usually slash slowly till you find an opening and then wiggle to finish enemies of. Easy low level enemies can give you a hard time because the controls just don't work well. A lot of times I try to slash one direction And link slashes differently, my slash gets blocked or worse the sequence I have to hit objects in resets. just traversing the sky overworld is a hassle cause you have to shake and turn the wiimote all the time. And I feel like i have to hit up on the dpad all the time. How much easier and more relaxing would it have been with just a stick and a button. All the pointing of the bow and slingahots works great though. I hope they don't build the controls around the wiimote. Maybe give me choice and don't hinge so many game elements around it. Fuck motion controls. Focus on a great game please, Nintendo, and not on how one can use the hardware gimmicks the most. Yes, use the game pad for the map and items.

"RandomActsofMakeup","t5_2vigj","Thanks so much for your thoughtful advice! I have freckles all over my body year round too. I have since I was a kid! Being pale and cool tonned is a nightmare alone. Every BB cream I have tried is too yellow. Most foundations are as well. I did try a tarte BB cream at Sephora and it seemed promising. I usually match at the jaw line towards the neck where I have less freckles and you can see more of my skin. Revlon Colorstay Whipped in 110 seems like a great fit but I would need to play in natural light to be sure. I am oily combo skin and I have redness and breakout on the chin. I don't tan at all. 

I dunno I just feel weird sometimes when I realize I don't look like other pale folk. Like they put on foundation and bam ""flawless face"" and I don't feel like that is possible for me cuz I have one million tiny dark spots. (Granted I found tutorials on youtube on how to create the look of freckles hehe) And being real, if you put product over em, when you zoom in, it shows. Maybe I am just being crochety and unrealistic cuz I never see anybody with freckles around here. :/

I know about application. I tend to prefer a buffing or stippling brush. Foundation brushes and fingers tend not to work too well for me. Though if I used a bb cream, I might think differently. (I love using my fingers for concealer though. :) (Still working on that too)","1406851663"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Thanks for all your kind words. A side-note, though. When I said that she'd burst into the bathroom and whip me with that thin plastic belt, I didn't mean to imply that she aimed for the genitals. She usually struck me on the buttocks and spine with the belt. But that's the thing about belts and tight, enclosed spaces: they loop around. So my genitals would end up taking a few good hits. As well as my chest and face.

But she wasn't aiming for region in particular. I don't think she gave it too much thought. Her rage was too frenzied and disorganized.

As for the reference to gas-lighting . . . that hit home. 

My mom, as an attorney, knew how to be professional. She was also attractive. So she had this Jeckyll and Hyde thing going. For years, her relatives were told that I was a compulsive liar [in the off-chance that I told on her]. Oddly, when I was younger I never did. Like an abused kid, I felt loyalty to her in a weird way (when I was sent to live with others). I longed for this idealized conception of ""home"". And, besides, I was embarrassed. So I never brought it up.

She couldn't risk that, though. So she'd do all sorts of evil things. Like when my aunt took me in after I was homeless, my mom found out and phoned her to say, ""I'm not making any accusations. But when he left, I couldn't find $300 I had in my drawer."" (I never took any money.) To another relative [a religious one] she blackened me in advance by saying, ""I think he's gay."" That particular relative, always so warm to me, suddenly grew frigid and distant. (I didn't know until years later that my mom had told them I was gay.) Needless to say, I wasn't.

These were ways to character assassinate me--in case I ever told. Finally, in a rage, I confided in a relative. He didn't believe me. Almost no one outside of my Uncle Joe's family--who saw the abuse firsthand--believed me.

(Uncle Joe, sadly, was a man of integrity and didn't rat his little sister out. He thought it was just an anomaly of an earlier time-period (her violence rooted in the anxiety and emotionalism of her divorce) and that she'd since worked her way through it. But even *he* had no idea that she'd gotten worse. Living 1,500 miles away, he was kept outside the loop.)

It was gratifying, years later when an aunt talked to me and said, ""You were right. All those years! I'm so sorry. You were right and I didn't believe you. Your mom started calling me at 3 in the morning, cursing. Yelling. Saying the most evil things. She wouldn't stop calling. I finally had to change my phone number."" 

She started stalking people. Like my cousin Kelly. Her sister Josie, her other sister Mickey [whom she told on, exposing the fact that she'd had an abortion to the entire family, etc.) Just ugly things.

One by one, they all saw that evil side of her that (in earlier years) she had been better at hiding.

She even flew back to her hometown after 30 years to show up on the doorsteps of old High School friends and acquaintances to ""tell them what she thought of them"". I remember her husband crying [realizing how damaged and out-of-control she was].

She even started to stalk me, after I left home. She tracked me down [using techniques she picked up as a lawyer. Law enforcement connections]. And she started leaving filthy, screaming messages on my roommates answering-machine. It got so bad that my roommate wanted to change the phone number, too. I got so angry that she was upsetting my friend that I called the police (to see about a restraining order), and had to sit through the judgment of the cop, saying remonstratively, ""But she's your motherrrrrr!""

He looked at me like I was an evil, ungrateful bastard, and my mom was this innocent Victorian angel. (Needless to say, this was before hearing the filthy, profanity-laden messages on the answering machine that sounded like scenes from ""The Exorcist"".]

Yeah: gas-lighting is a brilliant term for it.

I lived through that shit for years. It's only gratifying now when others--subjected to her behavior--have come forth and told me how they followed my ""brave example"" and finally cut her off.

The cycle of abuse ends with me. I have two children now. They've never been beaten, yelled at, or sent to live with strangers. They [unlike me] always receive Christmas and birthday gifts. I remember my mom telling me once, ""You don't understand. When you have kids yourself one day, you'll understand."" On the contrary. I *do* have kids now. And I understand her behavior even less.

My children will never be exposed to someone like her. That was my promise to myself: To raise normal, healthy, functional people. And thus far--I'm proud to say--I have.

I think most people would say that LSD isn't something that NEEDS to be done two days in a row, in the sense that you have to take double the dose you took the first day to get good effects and that it diminishes the positive effects. Often you will end up with a stimulated feeling without a lot of the positive ""psychedelic"" effects.

LSD is an awesome tool for serious introspection, which is also greatly diminished when you take it too often. You start to integrate your ego into the trips and it can become a relatively unhealthy mental habit that you can't break even when you're sober. I've know more than a few people who took acid everyday for extended periods and they're generally some of the more egotistical and pretentious people I know.

"freelance","t5_2qhs9","Just try tightening up your contract a little.  Specify language in the contact that accounts for late payments and additional edits.  I find this makes people give me the right content and ideas up front and makes them pay on time.  If you hired someone to build you a house and you said you want the door in one place and then a week later want to move it after the work has been done...you are going to get charged for the additional labor of moving the door.  Same goes for freelance work.  Spend more time up front getting the client to agree and sign off on stuff.  Then when they want changes, then point to your contact and inform them that you are happy to make the edits, but it will be billed at time and a half and you need to be paid in full (plus the late fee) before any work will resume.  If you let people make a million edits for free and let them pay late for free....they will do it.

I had a client a few weeks ago who was an acquaintance and needed a website and logo for his small lawn business.  I charged him almost nothing and didn't bother with a contract since I knew the guy, it was going to be a quick and simple logo and website.  Next thing I know the guy wants a million edits and then starts requesting edits just so he can see color changes and preview the ""what if it looked like this?"".  I finally had to put my foot down when he asked me to modify his logo to combine it with his friends logo because they were thinking about merging businesses within a year or two.  I had to tell him that would be an additional charge.  He said that was okay and he didn't need it...he just wanted to see what it might look like.","1406851672"

The net result is a bell-shaped (ish) function (of resistance as a function of speed) with its maximum in the middle (ish); this maximum is usually after the point at which the net resistance from air and friction equals the propellers' thrust.","1406851675"

Pic #1 is [this](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=48288pb08L&amp;in=S), only came in one Exo-Force set. The gray stickered tail piece in #7 is from this set as well.

The gray/brown assembly with one arm in #2 looks like the dino body from [1371 Spinosaurus Attack](http://brickset.com/sets/1371-1/Spinosaurus-Attack).

In #7, the gray tapered wedge with the sticker on it is [this one](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=8633-1), from a 2008 Agents set. *Edited to add, the gray stickered hatch piece from #2 is also probably from this set, hard to be certain from the angle but it looks right.

In #8, the assembly with the ""Track Marshal"" tile on it is [this](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3068bpb289&amp;in=S), from a subset of the Racers theme called [Tiny Turbos](http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Racers/subtheme-Tiny-Turbos).

Also in #8, the tail piece with the orange/white sticker on it seems to be [this piece](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=6239pb029). Came in the same set as the piece in your first picture, the [Mobile Devastator](http://brickset.com/sets/8108-1/Mobile-Devastator).

The two pieces from #8 with ""Police"" on them are from the [Speedy Police Car](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=4666-1).

The vehicle part in #8 with the friction pins and flame pattern is [this](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=30647pb04): came in three different Junior / Jack Stone sets according to Bricklink.

The three green pieces in #9 could be from the [8108 Mobile Devastator](http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=8108-1) as well: the parts list shows four included in the set.

Anyway at least now you know the ideological angle from which LiNK is approaching NK it's exactly what I've said it is all along.

I think LiNK is a vital tool for spreading awareness of the hardships refugees face and is worthy of the high respect I have for their own work helping refugees find a safe route out of NK. I don't know what LiNK's involvement was in the infographic itself besides being cited as a source for the data and information which doesn't contain anything but the hard truth of what North Korean refugees face. Don't misconstrue what I said an endorsement of George W. Bush's policies though, as I was/am ardently opposed to almost everything that man did as president.

&gt;I don't really get why the ""George W. Bush Presidential Center"" would need something called ""The Bush Institute"", you'd think that'd be sort of redundant.

The Center as a whole icludes The Bush Policy Institute, offices of the George W. Bush Foundation, the Presidential Library and Museum. ","1406851681"

It's actually not a bad gig if you do it right. I know some managers who make their bankers work six days a week, one of them being a half day and then call nights once or twice a week. I'm kind of the opposite of what a typical Wells Fargo manager is. I make sure they get a full day off every week, force them to use their vacation time, have one call night this year (and it was their idea to have one), I definitely don't micromanage, and the most important part I trust them to do their jobs. In return they make my job really easy. 

I think the biggest mistake most managers make is they feel they need to be in everything when in reality it's the opposite. Give your team the space to let them do what's best. Don't force them to conform to your way simply because it worked for you. I see this all the time and it's frustrating.","1406851681"

I chose it because I thought the action felt a little smoother. I also liked the subtle texture of the keys a little better. I don't have any manufacturer bias at the moment, since I've only bought that one.

* Frequently updated - small updates to correct errors and bugs happen frequently, larger updates with new OGL content happen regularly as well.

Things I don't like about it

* Slow - you have to wait several moments for things to calculate after updating almost any field
* Complicated - Takes a while to figure out how to use it.

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","**HBG:**

    Pros:

    * High damage output; further increased with Siege mode (Ability to fire bullets without reloading = Higher     damage per seconds; no relading needed)
    * Most HBG has more ammo capacity than LBG
    * Ability to increase damage output and defensive capabilities depending on the attachment equipped
    * One of the best speedrun weapon in MH if paired with heroics/adrenaline

    Cons:

    * Very slow movement speed. Almost similar to GS except a little bit slower imo
    * Long sheathe/unsheathe animations
    * Has a longer reloading times on some, if not, most HBG (Normal reload speed is slow imo)

**LBG:**

    Pros:

    * High mobility, speed somewhat similar when weapon is sheathed.
    * Most LBG has great elemental/special bullet capacity
    * Rapid fire - Ability to shoot 3-5 bullets with just 1 shot (LBG's tend to have a specific type of shot it can Rapid fire)
    * Can be equipped with Barrel or Silencer, which increases damage whilst the latter, reduces recoil

    Cons:

    * Lower damage than HBG, I'd say around 20-25% lower
    * Rapid fire sometimes leaves you fixed on your toes when shooting, leaving you vulnerable to attacks
    * Rapid fire also has a bit of a recoil at the end of its animation, leaving you *more* vulnerable
    * Rapid fire also deals lower damage compared to firing a single bullet. A perfect example would be when you fire a rapid fire shot which has 3 consecutive bullets, you would deal 40%&gt;40%&gt;40% damage per bullet which equals to 120% but comparing it to 2 single shots which would deal 100% per bullet. Obviously 200%&gt;120%. Keep in mind that this is an example.

**Bows:**

    Pros:

    * Unlimited ammo unlike bowguns; just keep firing, no need to worry about how much arrows you have left
    * Built in element attribute, saving you atleast 2-3 backpack slots
    * Depending on the bow, it offers a built-in bullet type such as being able to fire rapid and pierce depending on the charge unlike BG where you have to bring Normal S or Pierce S and so on.
    * Ability to charge, increasing your damage output and elemental damage output. Elemental damage is only increased on fourth charge.
    * Also one of the speedrun weapon contender, if paired with heroics/adrenaline
    * Coatings allows you to enhance your bow depending on its type. Power coatings increases your damage output, while Poi/Slp/Para allows you to imbued your weapon with status ailments. Keep in mind that when using status ailment coatings, it complete replaces your bow's element, if it has one.

    Cons:

    * Charging depletes stamina which leaves you unable to roll if you've charged for too long because of the lack of stamina. Always try to fire away once you've reached the final charge.
    * A very monster-specific weapon unlike HBG/LBG where variety and versatility comes in terms of ammo types, You can't just stick to one bow in the whole game. You *have* to make different kinds of bows depending on what monsters you hunt and no, Raw rapid bows aren't the best ""overall"" bow type in the game.
    * Requires you to stay atleast 2-3 backhops away from your target spot in order to deal a consistent amount of damage. This means that you're more closer to danger and prone to some close range attacks.

That's all I could think of. Let me know if you want to know more. If anyone who've read this and think I've missed something, feel free to add it.","1406851693"

"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

Basically we all compete to find shares on the P2pool's sharechain (similar to the blockchain but much faster... 15 seconds per share) and once a block is found, it is split among the miners who helped find it. It is sent straight to your wallet *without* going to a pool's wallet to mature. This means that a malevolent pool operator can't steal your hard-earned coins.

Since P2pool uses PPLNS, it takes a few hours to build up to full payout, then you continue receiving coins even when you stop mining (for a period).

The only way I could see it shaking out would be to sign Donaldson to a comparable contract to what he'd get through arbitration solely as an effort to maybe balance out his pay a little better each year instead of have it be super backloaded like arbitration does (of course, this risks either party mis-estimating production and subsequent arb raises though). Other option would be to lower AAV a little, and sign him a couple years beyond arbitration. In either case, Donaldson and his agent probably wouldn't agree as long as they both believe in Donaldson's ability and value unless Donaldson really really really wants to stay with the Athletics irregardless of financial shortcomings.","1406851705"

The following: Theodor Herzl was known to be an atheist and yet he promoted the idea of a Jewish state in Israel and even Argentina, which also proves his alleged bond to a ""Jewish"" state. 

Can you safely conclude, that Herzl abused Judaism within his concept of Zionism to mobilize the masses and ultimately establish Israel as a state?

And, assumed Zionism does not represent true Judaism, how come the majority of Jews support Zionism anyway? Is today's support based on conviction or missing enlightenment/knowledge (of the missing bond between Zionism and Judaism)?

We had a super fun test &amp; tune last week, where I got to try Autocross for the first time.  I had a blast, and ended up signing on to race this sunday as a novice.  The car is a 1971 MGB with a Nissan red top SR20 turbo motor.  Running Toyo R888 tires, a Jaguar rear end, aftermarket suspension &amp; brake calipers, this thing was a blast to drive!

A question for the veterans here:  If you have a codriver, do you guys drive in the same heat?  My friend and I were wondering if it would be more beneficial for us to drive in separate heats to give the car some time to cool down between runs?  I wouldn't think there is much of an advantage regarding tire temperature, as it probably cools down pretty quickly while we wait for our next run.  

A couple of pics taken while final touches were put on the tune.  Cheers!

What happened is that in brasil, usually the players image rights contracts don't have a clause specifically stating that the clubs can licence the images for videogames.

The thing is, according to brazillian contract law, a person's image is a specially protected class that can't be licenced generically. If you want to sell your image for a videogame, your contract must state that. 

In general, the player's image rights contracts only mention club marketing and tv broadcasts, and therefore the club is not allowed to licence the player's image to a videogame. 

Since no one noticed this until now, to make FIFA 15 with real players EA would have to contact each individual player and negotiate image rights contract individually, so they opted to exclude the real brazilian players from the game.

Fun fact: apparently every single player can sue EA because they used their images in past games without the proper licence.","1406851714"

High fibre = bad , for Crohn's disease, and many people simply can't understand this.  So any kind of super salad diet, or fruit for breakfast lunch and dinner is probably going to end badly.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Playful sex might mean chasing her through the apartment, then when you catch her, tickle her until she collapses in shrieks and giggles. 

Gentle means no cervix banging and she might not like doggy style but instead prefer face-to-face positions. When you are fucking her, do it slowly and rhythmically rather than hard and fast. Great foreplay for gentle sex is slow dancing to some great music, kissing her passionately, nibbling on her neck and shoulders and back. Running your hands featherlight over her whole body. Massaging her ass cheeks firmly, followed by very light spanks. 

She will definitely want eye contact and lots of it. Instead of dirty talk, do romantic talk (""You are so beautiful, etc.). Whispering in her ear is best, as it will add some delicious shivers. Instead of pulling her hair or choking her, run your fingers through her hair and tell her it feels like silken strands. Lick her neck and nibble on her earlobes. 

Play with her labia majora like they are play-doh: pull them, massage them, pinch them gently together, use the heel of your hand to rub her mound. Scratch your fingernails against the bottoms of her feet (tickles). Stroke light, decreasing circles around each breast, drawing ever closer to the nipple so that she can anticipate the coming touch. Suck, lick, bite (super gently) the nipple after teasing up to it for a long time. Okay, hope these ideas help.","1406851717"

"howtonotgiveafuck","t5_2tna8","Have a bit of a weird suggestion here, and not sure if it'd work for you. But maybe read ""Search inside yourself"" by Chade-Meng Tan. He's a google engineer so he approaches things from an engineering perspective and his book is a nice humoristic guide about mindfulness and dealing with recurring thoughts. It has taught me how to handle recurring thoughts and overthinking better. If you often find yourself in a ruminative state and perhaps feeling slightly depressed, you could consult the ""Mindful Way Through Depression"", which teaches how to get out of the ruminative state, I think. Even though the depression part wasn't really relevant to me (EDIT: by which I mean, like most people I can be sad sometimes, but it's not chronic. But still, the book is relevant for sadness), I've found the book useful for learning about rumination.). If the depression part doesn't suit you, it's still an interesting book about mindfulness, emotion and thinking.

When you're overthinking, you're basically just inventing or looping stories I think. It's never going to solve anything. There is only the here and now and each moment you can start anew when you take your stories with a grain of salt. 

(For example: I have had some issues with rejection. I made a story about it in my head: every time I got rejected for something, it'd ""confirm"" the story and make it stronger. Then I'd start thinking about how to ""fix"" whatever was wrong with me which might have caused the rejection. But it's just a story I would repeat to myself. The real occurrences of rejection were rare, but the overanalyzing basically kept those occurrences alive. But really, there is and was nothing wrong with me. Shit happens. You deal with the consequences, learn from it _when neccessary_ and go on. If you start to think about why you're thinking about it, and what is wrong with you that you are thinking about it, and what other things are wrong with you or might go wrong for you (bad karma), you just keep repeating your biased version of the past and you will probably also suffer the consequences for that)

EDIT: by the way. I've mentioned depression and someone else has mentioned anxiety. Don't use these to provide further stories for yourself about what might be wrong with you or what might go wrong. There's nothing wrong with you. You ""get a bit paranoid"" sometimes. Sometimes isn't _now_. Don't make things you don't like into a problem to overanalyze. ","1406851719"

&gt;The objective is to increase your CO2 levels in your brain

I have heard of bro-science before, but bro-yoga-science is a first.  

For one, yoga does not refer to 'CO2 levels in the brain'   Then there is the fact that you can not  measure CO2 levels in the brain without opening the skull and sticking a monitor in there.  

So yogis are not going to refer to an objective that they cannot measure.  

Second, yoga teaches to avoid strain, and rising CO2 levels in the blood quickly becomes very uncomfortable and triggers a strong urge to breathe.  

When a person feels like they can't breathe or are suffocating, that feeling is triggered by high CO2 levels in the blood (the body cannot monitor oxygen levels in the blood so CO2 is monitored by the body instead).  ","1406851722"

If he'd taken Joff, Myrcella and Tommen in hand when he had the advantage, he could have protected them while conducting a handover of power to Stannis.

At the point Renly suggests this (GoT), Ned knows they're incestuous bastards himself, and knows that Stannis is Robert's rightful heir. Just before, Ned had written out Robert's will and purposely lied to Robert about Joff not being his son.

What really puts the children in harm's way and creates the certainty of bloodshed is Ned's decision to tell Cersei he knows, and then to attempt a coup himself after alerting her.

Quickly scooping up the children first would have kept them safe while neutralizing the Lannisters. Stannis would have no need to go to war against Ned, because Ned, knowing Stannis was Robert's heir, would have simply turned over the throne to Stannis when he arrived.","1406851723"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","I have to agree with this statement. My friend and I have played it a couple of times with two players and it just doesn't feel as great as it does with three or more. I think ideally when you control the dummy player you envision this amazing play where the dummy is going to play this card but to do so they have to pay you all their gold so they can use your resources; you feel fantastic because you get all this money and possibly a card that your opponent wanted is now gone. That is the dream, however, most of the time when I control the dummy player I just discard something that my opponent would really like for three gold because this situation is always available and requires a lot less moving parts to accomplish it. He does the same thing and in the end that's just not that exciting.","1406851734"

So as soon as you leave your job, you are getting money from, you turn the fuck around and go to a store to buy some other shit someone else just worked on. Its a cycle. An awfully hard one to break free from and break. You said this, "" It would be such a relief, kind of like the book 'The Alchemist'. If you work towards your goal/passion/dream the universe will help you, a chain of event which will ultimatley lead towards your goal.
There has to be more to life than just 'making money' 'having kids'. Get out your comfort zone, do crazy shit man."" Realize what you goals/passion/dreams are then go and try to accomplish them, what does living in an old car and having no money accomplish?

"thedivision","t5_2xiqd","I just find it a little (I mean a little, not very significant at all) that the customization in destiny is stat dependent. The highest rated armour set looks cool, sure enough, but i thought that there were other pieces of less statistical benefit, and I liked more aesthetically. Sacrificing looks for stats isnt exactly customizing to me. I hope the division has a more traditional form of it. Obviously weapons are customizable from a gadget and attachment POV but I hope that that stat boosts remain in the ability section and not on what you wear. For example, a baseball hat vs a beanie. I'd hate to hear that the hat is a disadvantage because the beanie has thermal benefit. I guess I could understand it if there are helmets and the helmets protect against headshots but I'd imagine that then everyone will wear them, because they have that stat boost. It kills customizing when I need to wear a certain piece/type to get it's gains.

But after all is said and done, I do think it makes the most sense. It is an rpg after all and it's pretty traditional that gear is stat based to add another layer of strategy into of skills and abilities. The remedy would be to have multiple pieces of gear that all have the same stats so then players get to chose how they look and get their advantage.

Fetches really help prevent you from digging through too much land and risking a failed storm attempt.

If you want to build it on a budget, I recommend 4x Island, and 12x U/R duals of whatever you have laying around. If you can get the rest of deck you can get a pretty good idea of how it's supposed to run. Personally my deck goes 4x Scalding Tarn, 4x Steam Vents, 4x Island, 4x Shivan Reef.

By the end of the season, our offense was rolling. I will admit our offense was subpar early in the season with Bell under center for the most part. That's why we lost against Texas and Baylor. I believe that with a healthy starting Trevor Knight, we would have beaten both Texas and Baylor.

If you can get anyone at Comcast to admit this plan is available, grab it.  You may need to call back and talk to several reps before they relent.  In the mean time, go to ebay or your local craigslist.org and buy a cable modem that supports at least docsis 2.0.  Should cost under $10.  Comcast will charge you a monthly fee to rent a modem.  If you will have multiple devices needing internet connection get a wifi equipped router as well.
If there was previous Comcast service at your residence you can do a self install.  You will need to call and give them the MAC address for your modem to activate service.

I'm not being negative here, I think now that you understand focal planes how to create bokeh you should challenge yourself to get shots that not anyone can just go walk down to the beach on a fairly sunny day and get.

Restaurants are great (do you really need 500 choices?) and the traffic is non existent when you compare to those three cities. Sure the entertainment is limited in comparison but with a young family your time for this kind of stuff is as well. For us when a cool event it happening it make you appreciate it that much more. The ability to get to PEI, the Valley and South shore on a Friday afternoon with too much hassle is a huge selling point people don't think of. Try and getting to the Muskoka after work on a Friday from Toronto, forget it. The other reality is that to really take advantage of all a city like Toronto or Vancouver has you really need to earn big money, the ""average is just going to allow you to do much.

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","I actually think this would make for a great third movie, if you're willing to retcon away the whole ""alternate universe"" thing.

Fast forward a few years after Into Darkness. The Federation is suffering from a ruinous war with the Klingons and Romulans. Old Spock decides this timeline is for the birds and decides to put right what once went wrong. He and angsty-Spock head to the Enterprise lab to work out how to reverse the time travel, go back to the original timeline and save Romulus while bro-Kirk tries to buy them time even as Starfleet Command tries to send the Enterprise from battle to battle. Meanwhile, the Spocks bond a little and work out a solution. While Kirk takes the Enterprise into Romulan space to steal a cloaking device, the elder Spock reports to the bridge while his younger counterpart borrows a modified shuttlecraft, goes back through the time rift, and saves Romulus. At the end of the film, the young Spock (safely back in the real timeline) returns to Vulcan, the other world that he saved, to begin the Kholinahr training.

You'd have to contrive some plot reason for the Spocks to switch places, maybe the elder Spock is ailing and doesn't feel that he can carry out the mission or something. The emotional center of the movie would be with the younger Spock growing up into the logical Vulcan we know and love. ","1406851760"

As an example : crush fetish. There are people who are sexually aroused by, and able to orgasm from, the sound and sight of insects being crushed. They have difficulty being aroused and / or climaxing without seeing and / or hearing insects being crushed. 

That's just an example, that illustrates that a fetish is something not normally sexual, which elicits sexual excitation or orgasm.

I get people all the time connecting with memories they've forgotten or repressed, which I don't see happening with just distraction.

The eye movements have been replaced with other forms of bilateral stimulation (stimulation alternating brain hemispheres) and been found to be just as effective.  I personally use headphones that play a tone back and forth.  Using tactile stimulation also works.  I'm not sure how much work has been done with replacing it with something random like hopping on a foot or something.","1406851761"

"Kikpals","t5_2vnle","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/kikpals because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**





Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

One of my friends got an internship with Amazon and stayed for a year. While he really liked the town, he knew no one and found that the general consensus from other people who had done a similar thing was that it's SO difficult to make friends. While this is true for most people post-school, he found that in Seattle people were friendly, but not openly wanting to be FRIENDS. So it was a very pleasant place to go and stay, but it was lonely as hell despite his best efforts to get coworkers to go out and do meetups through various clubs.

I had a separate group of people who essentially decided to move up to Seattle at different points over the course of a year, and they seem to be having a blast. However they're a little closed as a group and would probably thrive wherever they go together.

W: Divine Wings: Lizodo activates his wings into action, dashing Lizodo forwards, and giving him a short burst of  movement speed. While w is activated, Lizodo is invulnerable to being body blocked

One thing is for sure though, the astronomers noticed and started talking. 
Forum posts, phone calls, emails. 
Everyone said the same thing. ""What is going on?""

No one had the answer. 


The Sun was there, sure, as was the moon, the planets, everything was as it was. But nothing outside of the solar system. NASA reported that they were in contact with Voyager 2 but that Voyager 1 has disappeared along with the stars.  A Month later Voyager 2 stopped responding as well.  Hell even the oort cloud appears to have gone AWOL. 


Astronomers the world over all reported the same thing. Completely normal observations inside our solar system. Abnormal outside. 


No radiation appeared to be entering the solar system, visual, electromagnetic, or otherwise - but then a strange thing happened. People started noticing the blank background of our now much smaller observable universe was heating up. Slowly, infinitesimally, fractions of a degree Kelvin but still, it was definitely getting hotter.  


For months we watched, our eyes and ears turned outwards for any sign of something beyond our solar system or the heat we had detected. Eventually the scientists had gathered enough data to model the heat signature. What they discovered was unbelievable. Many still choose not to believe it, but the evidence all points to an undeniable conclusion. 


We have been quarantined. 


A massive shell has been placed around our solar system, a mythical Dyson Sphere. But by who? For what purpose? And most puzzling, how? 


So now we wait, for whoever walled us in to come knocking at our front door. 


I hope, and fear, it will happen soon. ","1406851770"

I believe that the meadows is how Okikura sees the future so It was really cute of him showing her his ""secret"". 

  And of course Yanagi being the best character of the showing confessing her deepest love to a family member (my guess is still cousins).

Lopez has been better (in my opinion), I've read some reports on Casillas beeing less enthusiastic in training than Lopez and lastly that on multiple occasions he didn't help Lopez warm up (usualy the substitute goalkeeper drills the goalkeeper that is about to play). So there is this lack of professionalism that doesn't help.

But for me the most important thing is to be fair. I don't want him to play because he is San Iker, I want him to play because he trains hard and has an exceptional level.

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","Well I've only used it for a few hours so far but I like the browns quite a bit. They're obviously noisier than I'm used to, having upgraded from one of the standard Razr rubber membrane gaming keyboards, but it's a pleasant sound and feel. I was torn between browns and blacks since the blacks are a bit quieter according to the youtube videos I've seen, (or at least the clicks and clacks are lower in pitch,) but I thought I'd prefer the tactile ""bump"" in the brown switches and so far it definitely feels really nice.

The keyboard is surprisingly heavy and solid-feeling. Build-quality seems excellent. The only thing throwing me off is the fact that the base is so thick, and it doesn't come with its own wrist-rest, so I really need one of those now because the angle is uncomfortable to type on otherwise. But when I do have something to rest the bottoms of my hands on, it feels like a dream to type on. I definitely feel like a significantly faster typist with it. I've been getting some input lag every so often, (well actually twice while writing this sentence) but I'm thinking there must be something going on with my computer, not an issue with the keyboard itself.

The lighting options are definitely a lot of fun, although to be honest I probably won't use them too much--I realized once I tired of playing with them after an hour that it's all a bit gimmicky, really. I can see myself side-grading in the next year or two to a more grown-up and mature-feeling/looking keyboard like the Poker II. But in the meantime, I'm looking forward to seeing what I can do to customize this one.

Oh, and one more thing: what I was really curious about before I bought this, and what no one seemed to be able to tell me, was regarding the blue LED lighting. In some pictures and video the Blue LED backlighting looked distinctly purple, while in others it looked blue. The answer to this mystery is that at full brightness it looks quite blue, whereas on low brightness it has that more purple-y look, in case you're wondering.","1406851776"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had two that tied for weirdest, but one was more of a tragic figure.

First was the fresh-out-of-college guy who had an ear for great indie bands, a completely unreadable face, and an unpredictable sense of humor.  Most of the time, the man was a robot, showing zero traces of emotion over anything.  He would occasionally chuckle at strange things, like the time he broke a donut in half during a status meeting.  He never explained what was so funny.  He just chuckled at his broken donut, holding it in mid-air, a piece in each hand.

When he would make a mistake - and he was fresh out of college...he made mistakes - he would put his head in his hands and say things like, ""I'm such an idiot.  You must hate me now.  Should I just go hang myself?"" and you'd have to spend half an hour figuring out if he was serious or not because - again - completely unreadable face.

The other co-worker was at the same job.  Before I describe this person, let me make something clear: I do not have a single thing against the transgendered.  This person was not weird because they were transgendered.

No, this person was weird because of the tangential things that came with his gender reassignment.  A few decades ago, this was a man.  A rather large, imposing man.  He decided that was not his identity and underwent gender reassignment.  The recovery was difficult.  He struggled with the hormones and addiction to painkillers.  About the time he kicked the painkiller habit, he got an unrelated injury that put him back on painkillers...and back in addiction.

Years of persecution (real or perceived), painkiller abuse, hormones, and therapy later and she was a total mess.  One huge, exposed, and paranoid walking nerve.  Some days, she was your best friend.  Some days, she was the most competent co-worker I ever had.  Some days she would lock herself in her office and cry.  Loudly.  Some days she was convinced you were trying to get her fired.  Some days she started arguments with other co-workers in front of clients.  Some days she worked like she didn't have a clue what she was doing.","1406851779"

World War I/II were predicated on the fact that half the world's states were entrenched in alliances. Short of NATO, there are very few concrete defense pacts between nations. Secondly, economic integration is really a big deal. I look at this current Russian crisis and while it's terrible that we aren't putting more pressure on Russia to make Putin change his calculus about supporting separatists in Ukraine, it's also in a way a good thing because it demonstrates that even if we wanted to split apart it wouldn't be easy. There are simply so many market and commodity dependencies that overpower political opinion on aggressing states.  
  
Lastly, of course, many nations have nuclear weapons. So, that's kind of a big deterrent. I don't doubt that this will be a turbulent century, but I think we need to anticipate conflicts on a flatter, broader, but less encompassing scale in this coming era. And of course it will be infinitely more complex than even the Atlantic can suspect.  
  
I just think that using terms like WWIII bloats and over simplifies the prospect of conflict in this century. We will simply never have the same amount of units on a battlefield like we did in ages past.","1406851780"

I want to make another disclaimer in that I ultimately can't tell you what you are but I can tell you whether or not some of your responses (both to me and to others) raise any particular flags that I would or wouldn't usually expect from a transgender person. I'd love to hear your thoughts and reactions on it and you can post them as a comment afterwards if you're comfortable with that. 

Actually, comfort is the theme and it's pretty straight forward.

Would you be content to live the rest of your life as a butch, androgynous, or simply gender non-conforming woman? 

Do you want to be acknowledged and admired for your masculine and non-feminine traits despite being a woman? 

Do you think your potential agitation with womanhood might result from its implicit association with femininity? 

Aside from the discomfort that might arise from living in a society that tends to look down on unfeminine women, would you be able to work everyday and go home every night and be comfortable with the idea of ""I'm just a different kind of woman and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that""?

That's really it I think. I do want to say that I've enjoyed talking with you. It's actually been pretty insightful for me in that I can see a lot of parallels between the way you're processing this and the way I did (i.e very rationally &gt;.&lt;).","1406851781"

Israel increased the buffer zone by 3km and reduced the Gaza territories by 40%. All the while destroying the buildings within that zone.

With the need to rebuild Gaza, Israel is asking the world to help it to police Gaza as part of a longer term truce. Whether we will get to that point is what is troubling, since the world is not yet accepting Israel's partly one state sovereignty over Palestinians, while discriminating against them.","1406851784"

This is the part that makes it sound like a legal question.

"talesfromcallcenters","t5_2urem","I work on a really small team and our manager sits with us. He hates manager calls, so whenever someone asks for a manager we're immediately like, 'Ok! Great! Just hold on!' and then start shouting for him while he's saying things like, 'Oh god, what now?'

I'm sure some of the customers who think we're going to be quaking in our boots at the prospect of the big, bad manager being spoken to are quite surprised at our gleeful reaction to the request. We do love tormenting our manager.

But a couple years ago I was on a different team that was massive. It was part of a different department and run differently. You wouldn't be able to find a manager willing to take a call if your life depended on it. I used to try to de-escalate it then, just because it might actually take 10+ minutes just to locate someone and get them to agree to take the call.

I have never had a manager call about anything that is my fault, so I'm always more than happy to let them speak to one if they want. And it's great, because on my current team our manager is fair and has our back and doesn't give the clients too much satisfaction if they're being crybaby bastards.","1406851787"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Where I live they are a little different I think from the American ones, but the problem is still the same. The worst is, the thing will tell you what to do exactly with Text, Pictures and Audio. You scan one articles barcode, then you put it to the side. If you don't put it there (it measures the weight) it will not let you scan the next article. 

SO MANY PEOPLE will scan the first article, hold it in their hand or place it around the scanner instead of to the side and don't get why it will not let them scan the next one, while the machine is repeating ""Please put the scanned article to the side"" and on it theres a picture of someone doing exactly that. 

Another thing is, that as long as you are still packing up (so there is still weight on the measure) it will not let the next customer through. I have lost count to hhow many times people will storm to the poor machine while I am still packing and desperately wiggle the article around in front of the scanner and then get angry while the display says ""Please wait until the previous customer has packed up"". 

In my observation, it's mostly middle aged people having troubles with it. Youger people get it and the most older people will go to the regular lanes. 
Once I had a really old lady (over 90) ask me to show her how to use it, because she can't see or hear well. I showed her and she paid attention really hard and thanked me afterwards. Two days later I see her again and lo and behold, she did it flawlessly. If she can do it right, why can't middle aged people with perfectly fine eyes and ears do it?

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Excellent read and very inspiring. 

I was particularly struck by the passage regarding this exercise:

&gt;Sometimes Nemoto tells his attendees to put a white cloth over their face, as is customary with corpses in Japan, while he conducts a funeral ceremony. Afterward, he tells each to carry a lighted candle up a hill behind the temple and imagine that he is entering the world of the dead. This exercise, for reasons he doesn’t understand, tends to produce not tears but a strange kind of exhilaration, as though the person were experiencing rebirth.

I think it's interesting. I don't want to speak inappropriately, so correct me if you disagree: It seems to me that when the suicidal crave death, they really desire change-- in themselves or their environment, but can't find a way to enact the change they need, so seek death. 

I think it was Joseph Campbell who said that people in this situation may not realize that to continue living *is to die*. To live is to change (impermanence) and to change is to die. 

I'm fascinated by the prospect that rehearsing one's own funeral can be an ""exhilarating"", even life altering experience-- though I'm not surprised.

I am still young and foolish, but looking back on some of the most volatile parts of my life I find that I appreciate those troubles for the way they forced me to confront a situation and change-- to let go of *myself*-- allow myself to die and be reborn.","1406851791"

And many of those i respond to don't understand: 

-The difference between world building and story telling

-What the difference is between lord of the rings and what is Tolkiens legacy. Lord of the rings is three books, not his whole library. 

-How stating that opinions are subjective changes nothing

This is problematic, as it basically annihilates any attempt at making a dramatic scene, instead more banking on the line of ""ST, give up.

There was lots of evidence that showed there had been others, and they had failed. But yes, this might have worked, and you're right, they should have tried, but the story here is that Joel (the main character) has lost too much, including his daughter, who died at the same age of the girl. He saw his daughter in her and couldn't go through with it.

But even if they got the cure? The world is fucked, throughout the game you see that most of the good people died, because you have to do bad shit to survive.

**Child of Light (VITA)** 

Fire Emblem: Awakening (3DS)

Bravely Default (3DS)

Grandia III (PS2)
 
Valkyria Chronicles (PS3) 

**Valkyria Chronicles 2 (PSP, via PS3 transfer to Vita)**

Valkyria Chronicles 3 (PSP or PC emulation, via english patch)

**Persona 3**(PSP)


As a personal recommendation, you could try out Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. The combat system is alright and the story starts  slow, but the world building/characters/ending are well worth it. ","1406851798"

"Animesuggest","t5_2ssl0","&gt;So I want some perspective on what you liked about the series (and why), so that I could possibly gain some respect for this show, and like it the way you do.

Don't bank on it. Not matter how many perspectives you hear your's will always be the most valid and ""right"" to you and although it might change a little most people's perspectives [made up of their values, beliefs, and whatever else makes us human] hardly drift from first impression by hearing opinions.  

I liked it so much for a variety of reason. [The first of which is the music] (http://blog.animeinstrumentality.net/2009/09/clannad-original-soundtrack-review/). The review I linked also mentions another thing that made the series so special to me.

&gt;Much of the show’s success is derived from seeing the personal and emotional growth that its protagonists, [Ship Spoilers](/s ""Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa"") , undergo as they fall in love and together, face the obstacles that fate has put in their path.

The journey you see the characters go on is one greater than 99% of the stuff out there.

The themes of the show weren't numerous but the main one was explored in greater depth than most other shows I have watched.  

Episode 18 of *Afterstory* remains my favourite episode of any show to date with episode 22 come in close second. The impact of both depends on how attached to the characters you are and the connection of a bunch of different memories you have of the show. It's extremely personal and pretty puts you in the same emotional and mental state of the MC. It's very hard to explain to another but if it doesn't have an impact the first time around I doubt it will a second or third. On the other hand, if it does the first time around the impact will hover around the same area no matter how many time you watch it. Heck, even hearing the ED from the first season is enough the make a lot of the people who watch the show rather emotional. The shows strength lays in the impact that those later episodes have and the growth of the MC.      ","1406851799"

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","I mean, I'm very glad that we're getting ANYTHING new, given that for the longest time all Nids had from forgeworld were some wings for Shrikes or something along those lines..  honestly the Dimachaeron isn't **bad**, it's just not worth the 200 points it costs.  If they reduced it to 125 or so it might be worth taking it over other Fast Attack choices (why the fuck is it Fast Attack, it certainly isn't Fast).

One thing that's worth a look, the new Meiotic Spores..  I haven't seen their full rules yet but from what I'm seeing on the updated Battlescribe files they look hilarious.  If they're shot, they multiply into more spores.  And you can detonate them at will, no need to assault with them.

Stonecrusher Carnifex looks like it'd be absolutely fucking brutal if it ever got into base to base with a building or vehicle..  **IF** it ever got into base to base with a building or vehicle.  Still only has 4 wounds at T6 3+.  Trivial to shoot down.  Also, WS3 2 attacks.  But that D3 Hammer of Wrath at AP2 doe.

Malanthrope looks like it could have some application.  It gets to make challenges, and if accepted the challengee is reduced to half its attacks and initiative 1 for the duration of the challenge, so that's fucking amazeballs.  If only the Malanthrope were an IC and could join a unit.  It may be i5, which is great, but it's still swinging at WS3 A3 Poisoned 2+.  Which I guess is okay, but it's still going to get armor saved all day long.  Should've made it an MC.  At **BEST**, it appears to be a ""support charger"", meaning you charge it in after the unit it's providing Synapse for.  Oh, and hurrah, it has the now-useless Toxic Miasma.  Meh.

If only they had some sort of system for billing each of them individually. /s

&gt; _Should we bill them directly for maintenance of the line to their house?_

If you want people to ""pay their fair share"" of maintenance, then the best way is to ... uh ... have them pay for their share of the maintenance. Isn't that obvious?

&gt; _So you wouldn't mind not paying anything and then getting hit with a $10,000+ bill when they need to crack open a road to get to your cable?_

What do you propose is ""maintenance"" on a wire? Do they clean and polish it every year?

&gt; _And foot the real costs of running a wire to your house to begin with?_

Yes, that's what's charged when you get a new line installed.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","I'm sorry, but if you think the current map system is too hard than this game just isn't for you. I'd seriously suggest quitting, as this is the easiest this game has ever been. Period, no doubts about it.

In comparison to how this game used to be, it's a joke now. All you're doing is complaining about the RNG. You're not realizing that this game is BUILT around RNG. Everything in the game revolves completely around your luck. You're complaining about your own bad luck, your own experience. This will be different for everyone, and so it's a pointless argument to make. Because some, like you will be mad just because you have bad luck. Others will be incredibly happy with the system because they've had a good experience with it.

I myself as solo player, with the current map system can jump from 66 - 78 in probably a week with the current system. And that's with being a soon to be astrophysics grad, and spending only 6 - 8 hours on this game. Which I'd say is about normal, or maybe below average for some.

Your whole argument is off of the basis of complete luck. Which therefore makes it completely unreasonable. The people that are arguing against the current system, like myself are worried about the game's overall health and fun-factor.

If you're going to complain about RNG, well than ARPG's obviously aren't for you. Or you might want to get pick up a copy of Diablo 3. That way you'll never be punished or have any pride in your characters. You can get max level, and get the best gear in a couple hours.

"FairyTailRP","t5_2zeb6","She begins pulling at the ties on the bundle, looking at the leaves there. She looks back over to you and smiles as she begins soaking a few of them in her own mug of steaming tea.

**And I am glad for it.**

Looking over to you, she smiles and listens to you speak. Was it so strange to find enjoyment in hearing your voice? It always soothed her a bit, perhaps another reason why she listened to you so much.

When you bring up your routine, though, she raises a brow but doesn't really suspect much of anything. Is she really being that much trouble? Are you busy pouring work and time into your Wave Magic training? She couldn't help but feel like she was being nosy, but she didn't think it was much to question about.

"ENFP","t5_2r4yi","This always happens to me, like clockwork. Somewhere between 4 months and 6 months, I freak out about everything and way over analyze the relationship, especially their level of attraction to me. Mainly, I get scared that their initial infatuation with me is wearing off, and that they will soon distance themselves from me.
My advice would to be open about it with your SO. About a month ago, I was doing my ritual ""oh god we're in a serious relationship"" freak out in regards to my boyfriend, so I told him straight up that it was happening. He's an INTP, and was able to offer some pretty good insight (since he's more inclined to the thinking side of things) that diffused my panic, including having pointed out that maybe the reason I perceive distance is because, out of fear, I build a wall and get distant myself.
I'm not sure if your particular panic aligns with mine, but I think the advice is sound. Talk to your boyfriend, and take a step back. You might be involved in some self-fulfilling prophecies, as is ENFPs are wont to do.","1406851808"

"ftm","t5_2t9mw","Not TMI at all. These are very similar to the thought processes and experiences I've gone through, fwiw, and I still don't strongly identify with being male. However, as I experiment with my presentation, public identity, hormones, etc, and try to take what makes me feel most comfortable in my skin and leave what makes me feel like ripping it off me and screaming, I am discovering the pieces of transition that feel authentic to me. For me this means I identify publicly as male, internally as ""eh, what is gender anyway?"" use only he/him/his in reference to me, take testosterone, bind all the time, dress in men's clothes almost exclusively, save up for top surgery, and fuck like a gay boy (who happens to have a vagina), lol. All of these things may change as I work my way into myself. For now ""trans guy "" is what describes me closest and makes most sense to others. Internally, I don't need a label yet.

If you're asking ""what do I call myself?"" I can't help much. I have a serious fear of commitment (to labels, to identities). If you're underlying question is ""should I transition?"" my advice is yeah. In bits and pieces. In experimental mode. However is comfortable to you.

Yes, focusing on school and keeping your grades up is the most important thing. However, if you're not doing much else and have time, I recommend any of these things:

1. Start asking around / e-mailing some professors who are doing research in stuff you're interested in. It took me a while to find a professor who would take me in so you could use this time to find a cool PI and perhaps start working for them by the time it is next semester or even starting this semester if they're willing. (If research doesn't interest you, you can look for meaningful shadowing / volunteering experiences as well)

2. Get close to professors. Ask questions, attend office hours, and make some good relationships with them. When it's time to collect letters of recommendation, it'll be helpful to rely on these people. 

3. Join some clubs and do some fun stuff! Being a part of some interesting groups will set you apart, give you something to talk about, and most of all you should be having some fun!","1406851818"

"news","t5_2qh3l","Not to mention the psychological component. A phone that was fast enough suddenly feels slow when it's no longer the shiniest thing on the market. IMO this is even a bigger cause than the new OS factor. Proof of theory: I had a 4s until like 2 months ago when I finally bought a 5s. The new phone is noticeably faster but I never would've said the old one was slow. It was plenty fast and the increased speed of the 5s is nice, but IMO not honestly that noticeable. (On a user level that is, on a hardware benchmark level it is far faster). 

But my little brother, who had a 4 (without even Siri) never complained of his being slow or anything *until* I got a 5s. Then all of a sudden it was an abominable tortoise and be desperately needed an upgrade. Was his phone really slow? Actually, being that it was three generations behind, yes it was, *but it didn't bother him until I got a 5s*.  And again, while a 4 was slow my 4s was not bad that phone was like 4 years old. And realistically, my mom still has a 4 and when I use her phone it doesn't even really feel particularly slow. I mean it's noticeable, but certainly not annoyingly so. People are just whiny kids who want to blame apple for all their problems. The reality is that both apple and android make amazing products that are generally the best that they're physically capable of producing at the time and that the progressive march of competition eventually leaves those products behind.

- Because you're bipolar, you know that you can feel up and down and all over the place. One thing to remember is that the feelings come and go, but they always go. :)

- You already seem to know that your mind is your worst enemy. That's an awesome step in overcoming the fears you have.

- And lastly, you're never in the way. Your parents love you, and I'm sure not being married at 24 is not the worst thing they could imagine for you.

You know, you sound a lot more sure of yourself than you think, and you're doing well. Please stay with us a while longer.","1406851821"

"Insurance","t5_2qs6s","Our policy wording here in Canada states ( I assume it's similar in the US):

&gt;Where loss or damage arises from a peril for which a premium is specified under a subsection of this section, the Insurer further agrees:

&gt;(a) **to pay general average**, salvage and fire department charges and customs duties of Canada or of the United States of America for which the Insured is legally liable;

Basically this means they give you the current average market value. A lot of adjusters I know will go on to a site like Kijiji or Craigslist, look at what your vehicle is selling for in your area, and then take the average price between three or four listings. This is why you can negotiate the amount of a settlement, if you can show that your vehicle is selling for more than what they offer, they can adjust their value.

As for taking the salvaged vehicle after a loss...I personally would never recommend this. You may end up having additional costs pop up that you were not expecting (i.e. you may need to get a salvage report or vehicle inspection done). And as I mentioned, some companies may deny coverage for your damages.

You are correct that the resale value will be diminished if you take the salvaged vehicle. Basically you are purchasing a vehicle that at some point was deemed too expensive to repair or damaged to the point where it was no longer drivable. ","1406851824"

"Briggs","t5_2xzvh","I think a single, undefended sunderer in a poor position is trivial. And it *should* be trivial. I'm fairly salty about it because I've been playing the Sundy popping game long enough to have developed methods, procedures and tactics that work pretty fucking well for keeping the things safe. All it takes is some effort on the part of the people using it as a spawn to keep it safe. What this change reeks of to me is an extremely lazy way to cover the arses of people who couldn't be arsed defending assets critical to maintaining an offensive, and don't have the forethought to create redundancies when staging an attack. 

The generic counter argument to my disdain for this shield is that defending the sunderer is a boring job that yields no exp. I would debate that point very heavily. It defies logic to claim the are no kills and no experience in asset defence, while simultaneously complaining that you can't deploy a sunderer and leave it alone for thirty seconds without someone nuking it. Who's taking the things out? I'm pretty fucking sure it's not the tooth fairy or Santa Claus. If you stand guard and man the guns on a sunderer you can pretty well guarantee yourself a steady stream of kills as player after player comes running along, right into your weapon sights, as they hope for a quick and easy explosive kill on the giant cert pinyata. 

Once people get their heads around myth number 1 (no kills, no exp) and make an effort to spend some time learning how the meta game around sundy defence works you start to realise that it becomes a weight trade, just like point defence, and there are multiple strategies and redundancies that can be used depending on the situation or location you're trying to use for your spawn solutions. 

C4 is the favoured and most statistically common method of sunderer disposal. Lights, heavies and engineers carry it and it also allows vertical attacks on poorly positioned sundys. Mines are also excellent tools for sundy disposal, but only engies carry them, they can't fly and a double mine plant + sticky combo takes enough time that no amount of ""lol I won't render because I'm so fast"" will keep them safe from a competent guard. To kill a sunderer with mines literally requires an undefended sundy or grossly incompetent guards. 

Because of the above, blockade armour is the choice defence for the spawn sunderer. Don't ever use a single sunderer as a spawn solution in a situation where you are expecting heavy resistance, competent resistance, any sort of drawn out fight or vehicles to play a part in the main combat taking place. If you're parking a long way off site, using a well experienced squad/s that know how to use spawn beacons and/or going in with such shock and awe that no one will even have time to scratch their balls or leave the spawn room let alone worry about your spawn location then sure, use a single sunderer. 90% of the time though, bring a minimum of two. 

Always use at *least* one proximity repair sunderer to support the main spawn. There's a reason proxy repair is such an expensive cert investment, it's fucking amazing. If possible, bring two proxy buses and place them in such a way that the repair web of each sundy covers *both* other vehicles. Always ensure all sundys are parked far enough apart that explosives cannot take out two buses at the same time. This is minimum level redundancy. If a bus goes down, you have one or two on standby to immediately fill the gap and due to the repair web, any sort of ""trickle damage"" disposal method (vehicles, rockets, max suits etc) is severely diminished in its effectiveness and gives plenty of time for defensive counter plays. 

More to come, we haven't covered aircraft yet.

"learnart","t5_2s6fc","Ok, sorry for the incoming wall of text. I uploaded A LOT of stuff. I had a hard time tracking stuff down, but I just tried my best to upload things that I felt were indicative of my progression and things I make, so hopefully it'll give you a general idea of what's going on.  

Let's start at the beginning...  

It was actually nice to do this, because sometimes I forget how far I've come from my humble beginnings. About 2.5 years ago I decided I wanted to try to learn to draw, and I was terrrrrrible before that. Here's my first still life of an olive oil bottle, can I get a lol?:  
 
==Beginning Still Lives==  

*[First Still Life](http://i.imgur.com/OfvjcQL)  
*[Tea Pot](http://i.imgur.com/Hh4JDC2)  
*[Olive Oil take 2](http://i.imgur.com/uNhQmAX)  

After that, these type of drawings continued for awhile, although I did make some progress. Around this time I also drew the interior of my apartment a lot, although I can't find those pictures sadly. Eventually I progressed to doing this type of stuff. Drawing faces was of keen interest to me. These were all with references I don't have anymore, mostly pictures. Sorry for the quality too:  

==Beginning Face Drawings==

*[Face3](http://i.imgur.com/PtVsPhJ)
*[RandomBird](http://i.imgur.com/uwrA8H4)  

It's around this time that I decide that I want to start investigating this more seriously. Well, slightly seriously. I enrolled in just one drawing class at the local university that met twice a week for two hours, and I loved it. Here's the two still lives I could find from that period:  

==1st School Still Lives==  
*[Cup](http://i.imgur.com/d4bhbdC)  
*[Percolater](http://i.imgur.com/uwqvXSq) - I think this is the best still life I've ever done  

And then fast forward to random ones from today I found...I haven't done too many lately, and most of them aren't focusing on shading. Just quicker line studies.   

*[Sphere](http://i.imgur.com/bSW3kN9)

*[Headphones](http://i.imgur.com/Ua7u546)  
*[Hat](http://i.imgur.com/fdgFZhz) - Sorry so light  


These are various attempts at trying different styles of things, so not really polished. It should be noted here that I really hate shading. Or, not hate, but I feel like I'm really bad at it. I have a hard time seeing it in images like other people do, and I kind of get overwhelmed when I look at an image and try to shade it.  

Another problem I have is using pen when I should be using pencil. Pen just makes me less nervous for some reason.  

Here's some images of the last few projects for that class. The self portrait was set up using a grid system, to match it to the original reference. That way it was easier to get accurate.  

==Last 1st class Projects==  
*[Self-Portrait](http://i.imgur.com/ElzIP0X)  :  [Reference](http://i.imgur.com/o2Gwvnd)  
*[Final](http://i.imgur.com/NSOeN4b) - The idea of this was to invert ideas. So I made the fawn aggressive and the wolf meek. Don't look at that weird color disaster, my attempt to experiment with making a weird sun out of pastel.    

After that class I started taking other foundation classes, so I'll just put all the stuff I made drawing wise in here in a group. I haven't gotten into the actually higher level drawing classes or figure drawing yet.  

==The Rest of Class Projects==  
*[DeathGrips](http://i.imgur.com/inALK9I) - I made this in Illustrator overlaying this [reference]  (http://i.imgur.com/7q32lXt).

Let's take a [LOL](http://i.imgur.com/w5Uwzj4) break. Ok? Good!  

Ok, just going to group stuff in categories now to expedite this.   

==Human Stuff==

Then I also did some Loomis, but I got kind of weary of these. I wasn't sure if I should be copying the image exactly, trying to do it myself, studying or what. I just felt like the info wasn't sticking and it felt sort of pointless? I do love his books though, so pretty.  

==Loomis==

Then we have...Gesture. I am TERRIBLE at gesture drawings. I think I must have watched at least 20000 tutorial videos about gesture and I am still really bad at it. It just puts me in panic mode. MUST. GET. LINES. I think gesture makes apparent a weakness I have noticed, which is that I feel really rigid when I draw sometimes. I've remarked often that I wish I could draw more fluidly and gesture brings that right to the forefront.  

==Gesture==  
*[Gesture](http://i.imgur.com/wvCrBgq), [gesture](http://i.imgur.com/8TkAbfL), [gesture](http://i.imgur.com/oi1X1JP), [gesture](http://i.imgur.com/rMnksT0), [gesture](http://i.imgur.com/auvpmUx).  

Finally, I'll just add some miscellaneous things. I included the doodles so you can see what I do when I am at a loss at what to do. The doodles happen and usually that's when the frustration sets in. Everything I put down seems stupid and I can't move on, so I just quit. Even though they're just doodles. It doesn't make sense to my brain.  

==Doodles==  
*[doodle](http://i.imgur.com/Q8ZMBEl),[doodle](http://i.imgur.com/7bHxjSJ), [doodle](http://i.imgur.com/90ivtJh), [doodle](http://i.imgur.com/FDtD06G)!  

*A quick [sketch](http://i.imgur.com/Act9RT9) I made for my boyfriend where I turned him into a Game of Thrones character.  

*I really love the artist Zak Smith and especially his illustrated Gravity's Rainbow, so I copied a [few](http://i.imgur.com/6gRqFQl) of the [drawings](http://i.imgur.com/y0KXJ3Q). A friend said that's pretty useful when learning. 

Phew, ok. Sorry for the really, long overwhelming post. I've never actually consolidated what I've done like this before though, so it's pretty useful. I think this represents pretty well what I can do at this point.  

I think my biggest issues right now are fluidity, shading, getting comfortable with a pencil and values, and anatomy. But I'm sure there are a billion ways I can improve. I'd really love it if you wanted to slog through everything and give me some helpful tips, but if not I understand as well. Also, since I compiled all this up, is there anywhere else I could post it that would be helpful critique of someone of my limited skill level?  

Thanks for reading. And finally, my mindstate for the past year summed up pretty well: [Cheers!](http://i.imgur.com/2oFjozi).  ","1406851829"

After that I got a Recon and a Rapid Fire 20. I always loved playing with friend's nerf blasters, but I only ever owned those few. I put them away and forgot about them until I got to college and discovered HvZ. I promptly bought a rampage, and then never stopped. I have 20 blasters now, with more to come soon. I also managed to get all my college friends not into HvZ at least to join in nerf wars late at night in one of the academic buildings. I also was able to show my friends from high school that nerf isn't just for kids, and they've all enjoyed having nerf wars this summer.

"FantasyPL","t5_2snvr","This is just very good work, the watch list that is. Let me see if I can help you out with some opinions:

- Keep an eye on Vlaar (4.5) and Vermaelen (5.0) transfer saga as they could potentially be a way into the United 3-at-the-back defence

- Consider Krul and Speroni (5.0) keeper rotation as they have 16 easy home fixtures before the winter wildcard, so it's a near-perfect rotation

- I see you already have a Swansea defender, so ditch Demel and get a 5.0 nailed-on Stoke defender (Huth/Pieters) as Stoke-Swansea have perfect home rotation

- Keep Siem de Jong (7.0) of Newcastle in your watch list. He is a very attacking midfielder, who takes direct free kicks. He's already knocked 2 goals in pre-season I think, so he'll be a good watch

- I can see you plaing a 3-5-2, but here's a crazy suggestion. Go for 3-5-2 / 3-4-3 rotation. Instead of Kane, pick Long or Jelavic (my pick is Long because he is prone to get assists, but Jelavic is the penalty-taker, so your call). Then you have a core 3-4-2 (that's 9 players) and you will play either Long or Sigurdsson based on form or who has the easier opponent. For the first few game weeks, Hull has a rather easy fixture, so you should try that route in my opinion.","1406851829"

But either way I think it's a good move. It's important that what happened in CA arc has lasting consequences, it wouldn't feel right if Gon was good as new and adventuring again. Another thing is, we're getting to know Ging away from Gon. If the whole series is about Gon and Ging, it's important we get to know Ging the hunter, not just Ging the terrible father.","1406851832"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt; The Riddler's atrocity would go fully unnoticed right up until it happened. Parker probably wouldn't stay on the phone with Nygma long enough to hear the threats.

Maybe, but it's been an age since I've played it to say one way or the other.

&gt; Not knowing him, Parker might fall for Clayface's act. Clayface is totally a Spidey-tier villain and could mess him up in an ambush.

It's been a while, he might buy the act, but if Clayface was trying to be trick him into freedom and then attack Spidey, his spider-sense would warn him against such actions.  It's saved Spidey's life from setting off traps and bombs, so it's not a unreasonable stretch.

&gt; In several situations, I'm not sure I'd count on Parker getting all the hostages out alive like Bruce does. I'm not sure what Spidey could do about Zsasz' hostage taking.

I don't recall most of the hostages situations, but if we are talking about Zsasz's encounter at the beginning, Spidey could do the same, sneak up from behind and web yank him away.

&gt; The Spirit of Amadeus Arkham would go undetected.

I don't even know what you are talking about.

&gt; I'd like to see Croc and Spidey fight. On Croc's turf, with wet and hard-to-web walls, that'd be a tough battle.

You mean in the sewers, where Spidey has fought the Lizard (who's a tougher and faster opponent than Croc, and can climb walls like Spidey) and his webs works fine?

&gt; In several places Batman's suit is protecting him from contact with Titan-contaminated water.

I don't remember this part in the game, so point goes to you.

&gt; Without Batman on the island to play with, the Joker would leave the moment Parker turned his back (IE if Parker left to seek help with the Titan contamination). The situation is too chaotic for Parker to be everywhere at once, and would hold little allure for the Joker to continue to play with. Mr J needs a straight man, not another comedian to steal the spotlight!

That all depends on the resources available.  If Wayne (in advanced, under the pretense of telling Spidey to handle the Joker transfer, and here's the location of my cave - just in case) gave Parker access to his little hideout on Arkham, Parker, being a genius and a talented biochemist could probably MacGuffin a cure for the Titan contamination.

If Parker does not have the backing of Mr. Wayne and no access to his Arkham Cave, it becomes more difficult.  He might be able to come up with a cure from Arkham's medical wing, *IF* they have the necessary components and tools handy.

If neither of those situations a present, And Parker has to leave the island for help, then you are probably right.","1406851833"

proud_me!

&gt;Haha. Oh god. I went there once. There was a guy who called black people ""little more than trained evil monkeys"". I wasn't sure whether to laugh, cry, or DDoS the site.

I tend to visit it twice a year or so. Lately, for example, i learned that the Ukrainian new government is okay and not fascist as alleged by some. How? The consensus on Stormfront was that they were Jewish conspirators behind it and thus my conclusion is that it cannot be that bad ;d

&gt;Ok, that's banhammer right there. You need to edit that out. Also, it's kinda the epitome of my point.

Hm. I hope not. I would appreciate a mod telling me that it is not okay, since my reading of the sidebar is that it is... but i am flexible and lawful most of the time, so i would comply.

&gt;What? Ok, just like here, today, I said:

Hm. Well, there might be a bias on my part, i might find you more interesting or having viewpoints similar to mine. On the other hand, lately i read Zorba_the_hut post which was also quite and needlessly agressive (i am so getting banned :d), and i absolutely adore Zorba. 

(it was in the discussion about trannsexuality with Schala)

But, one important thing - my example and yours are completely different. Pbd is saying that someone else statement is wrong and more importantly, irrelevant in direct response to that statement. That is arrogant.

You on the other hand stated that you are aware that what you say is racist and, more importantly, you agree with that. That is almost the opposite (not to mention it was in the OP so it was not directed at anyone, and that blunts arrogance a little tiny bit).","1406851845"

They level up on their own but with no specific level, you just earn the abilities and skills as you play through it. If you look at his experience bar at the bottom when he's playing it doesn't have his level, it's a sun-looking shape, which means when he levels up he'll receive another mote of light. I assume that the level itself raises just to show how many motes of light you have received rather than seeing two level 20s and one has one mote of light and the other has 15 you'll see a level 21 and a level 35.

Not can. **Would.** Especially when it's something that involves Araragi. Remember that scene when Kanbaru was about to deal a finishing blow on Araragi? She put herself right in between them, **and** threatened the Rainy Devil.

I think it's not about her capabilities, but how people know that she would literally do everything even if it is to kill someone.

"racquetball","t5_2rl6u","I played a game with some buddies where the point was to get the server to be more aggressive with his serve and then again with the 3rd shot (i.e., 1-serve, 2-return, 3-server's shot). The game basically goes like this, server serves normally, receiver returns normally, server tries to put the ball away completely. If the receiver gets the ball to the front wall *at all* on the 4th shot, it's a point to the receiver (or side out, depending on how you play).

The point of the game is to force the server to not waste the serve. You've got to really use a good serve (whether it's a drive or a lob) to force the receiver to make a defensive shot, which the server can then kill. As a server, this is how you should be playing every point, but often times you can get lazy and just shoot for the ceiling.

Side note, this often works best when combined with ""tennis"" or ""ping pong"" serve where the server will stay in the box for 5 serves, to try and get used to the format.","1406851853"

Longevity=Better because good goalies play more, and can play longer. Not really sure what's so cryptic about that. If you have two goalies, equally skilled, but one is going to have chronic hip/knee problems (like 90% of butterfly goalies) past the age of 35, and one can play until 42... which is the better option.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Hamas, a terrorist organization in Gaza, has been shooting rockets out of civilians homes at Israel. Israel, in turn, shoots rocket back into Gaza, where Palestinians live. Hamas hides weapons and fires weapons at Israel from civilians homes so Israel drops flyers and warns civilians about incoming rocket strikes. These warnings are used by Hamas to move their men and armaments to other areas and threaten the civilians to stay in their homes, which leads to civilian deaths, which make the front page of the news and are headlines for the news. Hamas is attacking Israel because they want to exterminate the Jews, so Israel is fighting back, but unfortunately Hamas human shields are being killed in a war they don't want. Palestinians  want a nation of their own instead of being second class citizens of Israel, Israel wants to protect its citizens from terrorists like any other nation. 

Israel is the ""good guys"" for defending itself against terrorist. 

Israel is the ""bad guy"" for killing innocent civilians. 

Hamas is the ""bad guys"" because they ARE terrorists and are using the Palestinians as human shields.

In a perfect world, milling four deer is worth the wood when compared to a farm but it is a poor play because of travel time and micromanagement time.  Four deer are exhausted quickly and its easy to miss the idle workers.

These far flung mills have a secondary purpose - line of sight and close farms, so they never truly become obsolete.

Edit: Map specific. Scandanavia doesn't have berries, but they have packs of deer and fishing to make up for it. Yucatan is loaded with food - multiple boar, shore fish in lakes, extra berry patches.  You can delay farms a long time.","1406851861"

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","Use butter for flavour and a tiny bit of oil to help stop the butter from burning. Cook the breast on one side over a medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes until it's nicely browned, and you can see the white 'cooked' colour creeping up well past the bottom half of the meat. Flip it over, put a lid on the pan, turn the heat way down low, and let it cook for another 10 minutes. Do not lift the lid. Now your chicken is done. The inside isn't raw, and you haven't overcooked it so it's not dry.

If the outside looks burnt but the inside is raw, your cooking temperature is too high. This goes for whatever you're cooking, whether it's meat, veggies, or a grilled cheese. High heat does not mean more cooked. Turning down the heat will allow you too cook it for longer, allowing time for that heat to radiate inside the food and cook it, without burning the outside.","1406851864"

And a question, if I find a post which should have been marked as completed, is there anything I can do about it? Obviously if it has only been a few hours or even a day since the trade ended, it's understandable.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","Three years ago, while visiting friends in the wine-producing Languedoc-Roussillon region of southern France, Timothy McDonald decided he wanted what they had: a chance to experience small-town life in what is sometimes described as an unspoiled and more affordable version of Provence. A year later McDonald and his wife, Kathleen Brooker, took a mortgage on their paid-up Seattle [home](http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2012/11/21/everything-you-need-to-know-about-buying-a-home-in-europe/) and plunked down $200,000 in cash for a 15th-century former shop house in the remote agricultural [village](http://manhattanvillage.info/) of Azille (pop. 1,100), 90 minutes from the Toulouse airport. The couple, both in their early 60s, plan to spend several months a year there after she retires someday from her job as executive director of Historic Seattle. (McDonald, a semiretired architectural preservationist, already spends a month at a time there.)

While some aging boomers might put a premium on convenience or a place that can accommodate future physical limitations, McDonald and Brooker bought in a town without even a train station and from a contractor whose idea of tasteful renovations included removing the handrail on the narrow staircase of the three-story stone structure. And why not? They’re fit bikers, runners and history buffs who care more about the town’s proximity to Cathar Romanesque sites and enjoying their French, British and Swiss neighbors. “We wanted to have a bigger life, rather than have a bigger home in the U.S., and ironically we found it in a small French town,” says Brooker.

Of course, American billionaires and celebrities have always lived large in Europe. Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen reportedly keeps a staff of 12 at his hilltop villa in St. Jean Cap-Ferrat, along the Côte d’Azur. George Clooney‘s 30-room palazzo on Italy’s Lake Como has starred in many A-list parties.

But a weaker euro, low interest rates and crashing real estate prices in parts of the euro zone are prompting more ordinary American Europhiles to look at buying a piece of the Old World .

What they’re currently finding, says Ronan McMahon, who reports on real estate trends for the International Living website, is that European prices peaked between 2006 and 2008 and are now all over the map. Stratospheric London and Paris prices never fell that much and have headed back up. But an exodus of youth from rural France and Italy has made homes like the one Brooker and McDonald bought somewhat more affordable.

Then there are Europe’s real estate bust areas, which unlike, say, Nevada and Florida haven’t started their comebacks. McMahon’s advice for those areas: Wait until prices have fallen dramatically and be prepared to hold for a while. That makes him bullish on Spain and Ireland but bearish on Portugal’s Algarve and the Greek islands of Crete, Mykonos and Santorini, where prices are down only 30% from their peak. By contrast, along the scenic Ring of Kerry, near McMahon’s Adare, County Limerick, Ireland base, $100,000 can get you a country cottage, a newly built modern home or a building plot with views of the Atlantic. All would have fetched $500,000 at the peak. In Spain deal hunters have been scooping up apartments in failed developments from banks selling for one-third of the 2007?08 list price. A two-bedroom, two-bath apartment on the Costa del Sol with distant views (on a clear day) of the ocean less than a mile away can be had for $100,000.

Beyond the state of the real estate market, consider how a purchase fits into your overall finances and whether you’re really game for the practical, legal and personal challenges of maintaining a home in another country and possibly retiring there. Visit the area you’re considering multiple times, rent a place (rather than staying in a hotel), shop for food, do laundry and get the full residential experience, good and bad. Ask yourself what you’re looking for: a base for travel or a charming destination? A primary or second home? Or maybe just a vacation place that you’ll also rent out?

Two years ago Ray Stewart, a 63-year-old, Europe-based American telecom exec, bought a 3,300-square-foot apartment in central Brussels as part of his “lifestyle plan.” After Stewart retires in a year or so, he and his wife, Barbara Reno, 66, a former not-for-profit executive, hope to serve on corporate and charity boards, dividing their time between a house in the U.S. and Europe, with Brussels as a base. The city of 1.1 million is 80 minutes by train from Paris, two hours from London and a lot less expensive to buy in than either. Sure, the rent a Brussels flat commands is less, too, but Stewart doesn’t plan to rent it out. He acquired two units and merged them into a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath apartment to accommodate visits from the couple’s three adult sons from prior marriages.

At the 1989 reunion game I was sitting a few rows behind the A's bullpen a little boy probably about eight or so stood up on his chair as Yoenis was warming up his arm between half innings yelling "" Cespedes "" I didn't think Yoenis could even hear him over the crowd. I was wrong, he turned and flipped the ball underhand once his warm up tosses were done perfectly into the kid's mitt, I got chills it was one of the coolest things I've seen during a game.

This trade for me hurts like a bitch, I didn't think Cespedes would be gone until this winter at the earliest and expected him to be around for all of next season if I'm being honest as long as we were contending.

"minimalism","t5_2r0z9","It is interesting, as she appears to have fallen victim to her own critics in by writing from a distant and privileged position herself. 

In terms of quantity of possessions, your average Anglosphere inner city poor Hispanic, black, white, Asian ( or any ethnicity) family probably would not have a 'minimalist' lifestyle, and partially because the ridicule generally comes from ones own social group. Which is why unless on hard times, it is generally taboo to shop at thrift stores when one is from a poorer background.

In fact the denigration of the poor as a whole generally comes from the middle class, and the media (mindful of their audience) will do their bit to perpetuate fanciful myths, scorn,  and ridicule upon this class.

Where she is right is that there is a lot of privilege involved with the main advocates, and partially I guess that is symptomatic of the medium, sadly the demographic most likely to blog about these things are middle class, by virtue of having the access to the technology,  the know how, inclination, and because they are freer from the stigma of 2nd hand, or few possessions. That is why they can gladly join in on this minimalism trend. The same is easily noticeable on places like Reddit, this sub Reddit especially, is full of wealthy American kids from preteen to early twenties.

So to sum up, she's hit indirectly on a few points, but generally missed the goal.

* Chuck (5 seasons) is amazing if you like funny, cheesy, spy, romance. (9.5/10)
* The Walking Dead is pretty Solid for about 3 Seasons (9-8/10)
* Video Game High School (youtube 2 Seasons) if you're into video games, acting is ok, but plot is pretty good for something off youtube (9/10)
* Breaking Bad is really good as I've heard. I watched 1 season (8.5/10)

Now I'm not sure if you're into anime stuff, and it seems like you aren't because you wouldn't be here asking (you'd be too busy watching/aka addicted). Give it a chance it's actually a lot better than most TV shows in America. Besides reading you get used to it and some of them are in english. Just to clear it up all the animes mentioned have episodes around 20 minutes (not counting credits). So you get through episodes pretty quickly.

* Attack On Titan (8.5//10) really cool action packed, pretty gorey and creepy, but story line is really good
* Sword Art Online AKA SAO (9/10) Video Game/Romance which is really good
* Full Metal Alchemist **Brotherhood** (9/10) action packed teaching about alchemy
* Fairy Tail (?/?) I've only watched 1 episode, but another anime called Hunter x Hunter (2011) is what I watch since it's better (it's not on netflix, kissanime)

And the only way to lessen you attraction to men is lobotomization or castration (and these were done at the Atascadero State Hospital in the 50s and 60s near where I grew up, which only made the men damaged vegetables). 

Look I stayed in the closet until I was 26. I thought that I could make it work with ""just the right girl."" But I didn't want to lie to girl, so I kept searching. The first crack in my delusion was when I had sex with a girl. It felt wrong in so many ways, I couldn't even spend the rest of the night with her. I finally set up my OKCupid profile 9 months after that and haven't look back.

And from the tone in the post, I can tell that you know that you're living a lie. You're not bisexual who fell in love with a woman. You're not a straight man. You're *not* simply sexually attracted to men. You are a closeted gay man, who is scared of his emotional and sexual attraction to men, who loves his female roommate like a sister, who [can have kids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Texas#Adoption_of_children) with his eventual husband [even biological ones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy).

Watch [Pit stop](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397531/). It is on Netflix and is it about two gay men in small town Texas like you (one is even had an amicable divorce from his ex-wife). They aren't going on ""the scene."" They are just two men living their life.

Despite what your governor said this is not a disease like alcoholism. Nothing that you did or was done to you caused it. It is simply a normal part of human behavior, and has been for millions of years.

You think that:

&gt; The fall out is much worse than the misery from repressing it.

You are wrong. This lie you are living eats away at the very fiber of your being, believe me I have a very good idea of what you are going through. Your neighbor is an out gay man and got his car smashed up; that is just a thing that can be replaced. Your deteriorating mental health as you deny who you are to yourself won't be as easily replace. I'll bet if you ask your neighbor he regrets coming out, as growl will enter his voice as he says ""*Never!* Not one day.""

In the end, I'm merely a person on the internet and I cannot compel you stop hurting your life and your wife's life. I'll bet you haven't thought of her happiness have you? She deserves someone that wants her sexually, which something you have not said that you want in your many comments. You are destroying her happiness too; her wondering why you don't want her unless you have had a lot to drink.

"LicensedforBeauty","t5_2zo0d","Ombre is a great option for low-maintenance hair. You could keep the top/base colour pretty close to your natural so that the grow-out won't be as noticeable (maybe make it a tad warmer since you seem to like those tones and they look good on you!). You could do that, fading into a nice warm dark blonde, or a light chocolatey brown, or even redish. (Maybe something like one of [these?](http://media-cache-cd0.pinimg.com/736x/67/21/a9/6721a9783e74002f842c0ec28f186205.jpg))

As for the fading. Do you know if your stylist uses a filler when taking you from blonde to darker/red? When you lighten hair, you are removing its natural pigments, so you need to add those back in in order for the darker colours to stick properly. Sometimes stylists will skip the filler, especially in cases like yours where you go from lighter to darker (and vice versa) quite often. It's a bit harder on the hair to lighten back up through the filler. (Basically, a filler will help make the colour last longer, but will make it harder to change later on).

Fading could also just be due to the fact that you don't get your hair done that often. How quickly do you find it fades? Even permanent colours will fade if not touched-up regularly. Especially if you only get each colour done once before changing it. Not much you can do about it if that's the case, unfortunately. Sounds like your routines and products are good, so that shouldn't be the problem.

PS. I really love the colour in that last photo! Very pretty.","1406851879"

It dies passively, apathetically, with its eyes glued to a high definition big screen. 

It dies, sugary soft drink in hand as it posts political memes on facebook.

""We should change this,"" it says. ""We should do something.""

But its phone is used to snap photos of food instead of to call a congressman.

Its body sits ranting at the television instead of marching on the capitol.

It dies when it becomes complacent, always believing it cannot make a difference; that someone else will do it.

Freedom dies with each soldier who comes home to a world that won't feed it, house it.  Disabled and destitute, it sits on corners with cardboard signs, begging for a little change.

It dies when that change is spent not to feed it or house it for the night, but to buy a drink that soothes a damaged soul.

Freedom dies a little with the loss of each small liberty we barely notice.  With taxes from a government that no longer understands the needs of people half a continent away.  

Freedom dies in the same way it was born - in the souls of the men who want it so badly. Or not badly enough.

Freedom dies with the posting of this story, because when it is posted, it will still sit, in this chair, at this desk, remembering what it once was.

But now.

Now, freedom is too tired to save itself.

Freedom is dying.

She knows all about my problems too and is great with it. The only thing that might be making it difficult for your boyfriend to keep it up is when he stops looking or thinking about porn during sex with you, he might lose his erection. Have you found this? My mistake, from what you've said I believe he is being honest with you. Always a sign of a strong relationship. If he can go without using porn, you'll get an even better man, way better sex for sure, it'll be tough at first for him though. For me, I made it to 12 days recently, I felt blue balls soreness the lot, had sex and it was like 100 times better than just regular sex for me, I would say about 10 times better for her. It's been nearly 10 days since my last PMO and things are now really starting to change for me. I've become more emotional and sensitive. I am more turned on by my wife now unlike before after PMO I just wanted to sleep all day 'I work nights' but everyday. It's the little things that seem to mean more now. I know it has made me a better man. I felt awesome on day 7, lifted weights, did squats. Don't feel sore either. I feel super alpha, I can not go back to how I used to be.

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn. Or for short, FFXIV ARR. 

Has, in my opinion, a great storyline, and is among one of the better games made by Square Enix as of late. Yes the original did terrible. I even had the *fortune?* of beta testing both versions. This version is MILES better. Personally, i think the big difference is that this time, SE actually listened to the beta testers. The game still has certain flaws from time to time that need to be fixed by SE, but all in all the game is whole, and they are constantly adding new stuff to the game to, hopefully keep most people entertained. Even old WoW players are finding a new home in this game. Not exactly a pro in everyone's books, but who cares right?

The Community, is like any other MMORPG out there. Some servers have mostly nice people, others have a plethora of assholes, and a lot of them sit somewhere in between. 

If you were to play this, you would be able to play with a bunch of us from reddit, like the players who populate /r/ffxiv. There are more of us, of course. I personally am running a PC orientated Link Shell, a chat group of sorts, and am starting up a Free Company, which is exactly like a guild. I am looking for new members, So if you were to join the Leviathan server on Primal, that would be just great.

The game is able to be played on PS3 and PS4 if you absolutely must, but as a PC user, i must implore that people do what is right and play the game the way it was meant to be seen. You don't need a super high end machine to play it. The graphics can be tuned for many different specs and still look great.

"IdeaFeedback","t5_32j6h","This doesn't sound like a plot by itself. Just *having* powers and developing them should be a springboard for something much larger. If that larger thing is Maggie turning evil, I still don't know if it's enough. You only have a limited number of paragraphs to hook your reader; you need to make them count.  

If how Maggie discovers her powers ties directly to some larger plot (like someone breaks into the house and she kills/maims them and now there's that to deal with), then fine. But you need to get to it quickly. I'm not suggesting some sort of info dump at the beginning, but start with whatever action it is that leads to Maggie discovering her abilities. An everyday kind of story might bore your readers if it goes on too long. You know why they should read on, they don't.  

I'm torn about your main character turning evil. The best villains aren't evil in their own minds; they think they're the good guys. If you can *completely* maintain that with Maggie, then fine. I also think you need to be careful how far you take her down that path, but my interpretation of your question makes me think that's your plan. If you give other characters a voice, then I could see it working but you'll have to do it right.  

I don't like the everyday kind of story angle unless you wrap it up quickly. You'll lose a lot of readers fairly quickly like that. You need to give people a *reason* to turn the page.     ","1406851895"

&gt; why is pacman be incompatible with windows? 

Well, to begin with you disagree there is a windows mindset. Sure you can make payment work. You could also make systemd work on Windows.  That doesn't mean you add anything of interest. 

You scout around the issue of an arch mindset like a half arsed politician. In my opinion different OS's have very different working mindsets. Windows is about presenting stuff as easy, even if it isn't. 

Pacman doesn't fit a need in windows in a better way than other current windows software does. Making Pacman work is a humerus cludge, nothing more. 

Oh sure I can type the same command into a windows prompt... Now try it with:

&gt; ip route add xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx via xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx dev ethx

The point is the two OSs are so different making one command ""the same"" is so trivial as to be meaningless. 

It's disgusting because it gives the proll a chance to think it's the same while working in completely different ways. ","1406851896"

"TagPro","t5_2w7hh","Understood. Why is it not a mistake like any other? In my mind it's because I just told you that when it's the 3rd cap, it's working against your own team, and you did it again the next game, or you replied ""I do wat I want, $#%^&amp;"" Ninjaedit: I don't mean **you**, just the figurative you.. like you used. sorry.

Knocking someone into a spike is a mistake, stopping before you cap is intentional. Maybe a poor strategy, but intentional. When a player stays back and guards an empty base on a map like The Holy See, there's some ignorance there, or at the very least just poor understanding. They aren't intentionally trying to boost their stats or look cool though. With delaying the third cap, there is literally absolutely no benefit to anyone except the flag holder (having 1 second of extra hold time).

I think at this point we're just arguing semantics, and yeah, it's all rhetorical. I don't ban for delaying the final cap. I tell them ""Hey, don't do that. It's seen as being a jerk and showboating, and working against your own team"". I haven't had somebody do it again after saying that. Obviously the situation would dictate what happens.","1406851897"

"Life_Journals","t5_32pce","Well, depending on what kind of sewing you want to try, youtube is great. I learned how to darn socks on youtube, which helped me fix some huge holes in a pair of house-jeans. I strongly recommend learning the whip-stitch (which is like, the easiest stitch ever) and the back-stitch (which is a really simple, really strong stitch. I use if for just about everything). 

I'm a year and a half older than my middle brother, and four years older than my youngest brother. Growing up, we didn't get along. Mostly, we didn't have private space really, so we were always in each others' way. Between that and being made to share everything... my brothers destroyed several of my board games and books, some of which I still haven't been able to replace... we pretty much hated each other. I actually got yelled at by one of my teachers for completely ignoring one of my brothers when we were in high school. We both had to explain that ignoring each other was the only way we avoided fighting... she was just flabbergasted. Really though, it was the only way we could be treated as separate people while going to the same school one grade apart, and the only way we could get space from each other. Now that we're not living in the same household, we get along great, and hang out regularly. My other brother and I got along a bit better growing up, but as he was the one who usually accidentally destroyed my shit, it wasn't awesome. Now we're doing completely different stuff, so we don't talk much, but we get along just fine when we do. They don't get along with each other at all though, which is because past drama on both of their end, and it'll probably never get resolved.

Her family is really insular... and she thinks the fact that I don't call my parents every week (even though we live in the same town, have totally different schedules, and we still talk regularly) is dysfunctional. Her folks went out of town for a week, and within 24 hours she was having a total breakdown. This being after she married my brother and moved out of her parents house. No surprise that they moved back in with her parents. I'm the devil because I live with my boyfriend, but we have no intention of becoming legally married any time soon. I just wish she wouldn't act like my best friend when we're face to face so I could just have the argument, point out how she was living with my brother pre-marriage and that no, intending to get married doesn't make that not a sin according to the bible. Then she can either get over it, or not... but at least then I'd know where we stood without having to hear it from third-parties.

Yeah... not so great with infants, myself. I helped out one of my neighbors with their baby a few times, before they moved. I did okay. I'd like to learn how to handle it at least a little, because eventually I'd like to have a kiddo of my own... and I'd like to not feel batshit terrified of accidentally killing my baby because I don't know how to put on a diaper right. Once kids can talk though, I'm totally fine. If they're hungry/sleepy/sick, they can *tell* me, and I don't have to interpret crying or just guess til I figure it out.

My mom knows about it, but not how to do it, which is fine by me. She's not very computer literate, so even if she managed to pirate something, she'd just get herself caught doing it. Still though, most of the things she watches are watchable on Netflix or Hulu. For awhile, she was watching her shows on her laptop via the networks' streaming services, but you still have to have a cable subscription to do that. 

I mostly read low fantasy, which is a genre my boyfriend didn't even know existed before he met me. If you haven't read any, I suggest reading anything by Joe Abercrombie, or look up The Black Company. Sometimes I read scifi, but I prefer the classic type, where it's more about social commentary than tech... which isn't much what's being written lately.  

The only formula cop shows I like are Law and Order shows, primarily SVU and Criminal Intent. Oh, the asian psychologist dude from Law and Order? Yeah, he's one of the dude's psychs in Awake. That was pretty cool. 

Yup, I watched Awake and Continuum on Netflix. That's where I found them in the first place, actually. I also watched Scrubs for the first time on Netflix, and re-watched most of Trek... so if there's an older series you missed out on or want to re-watch, there's a decent chance it's on Netflix, too.

Mostly I just screw around on the computer or play videogames. I'm a pale-skinned redhead, so outdoor activities involve half a gallon of sunscreen or severe burns... which means I stay inside a lot. I like cooking, but my kitchen is tiny, so I do a lot less of than than I'd like. I'm going to teach my neighbor how to make bread from scratch at some point soon, because he's never done it. That'll be fun. I'm going camping next week with my cousin. ","1406851904"

If you meditate on MDMA, you can quite literally look inside of yourself and face unprocessed memories/emotions without the usual associated emotional resistance, and there is a backdrop of pure love that holds your hand through it all. 

It also ""blows away"" almost all resistance and negativity inside of you all on its own, which can give you a glimpse of your true self minus anxiety, but for more long-term benefit the above is recommended.  The only thing is that you need to make sure you find a good source of actual pure MDMA... a lot of fake/cut stuff out there. ","1406851904"
"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I didn't get my license til I was 22 years old, mostly due to anxiety behind the wheel.

Clear goals helped. I knew I was taking my test at the end of the month, no matter what. If I didn't have any plans set in stone I probably would have chickened out. The promotion was the light at the end of the tunnel for me.


I've been in your shoes and you said so yourself, it makes you depressed not to have a license. You say that you've been trying to learn for years, so what are the obstacles that stand between you and a license? Do you need more driving time? Do you only feel comfortable driving with an instructor? Do you feel like you don't deserve a license?

I've been riding for 10 years and have had many bikes from Japanese to Italian. The most expensive bike I've ever owned.

I had a sneaking suspicion that I was the youngest rider on one of these things, and from the looks of everyone else here, pretty much.

I'm used to stripped down, basic motorcycles. This thing has straight up spoiled me. I love the radio. I love the windshield. I love the saddlebags. It's like I can do regular person things on the bike without having to carry around all my gear. It's wonderful.

And the bike. Wow. My first Harley Davidson and it's absolutely sold me on the concept. My first week of having it, my wife and I took a quick round trip around the Bay Area. 280+mi zero discomfort. I tried this on an Evo. Fuuuck my legs and back. I'll be stuck behind some minivans in the redwoods and have no problem puttering along at 45 mph because of the rumble of the engine and the radio.

"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","&gt; They cite widely debunked pseudo-science as their rationale

But on what grounds? Not because of ""pseudo-science"", AFAIK, but because they say it still produces radioactive waste and may be used for nuclear proliferation ([both true](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power#Nuclear_proliferation)), and because it is both expensive and technologically risky. By current estimates, commercial fusion *may* become viable in 2050 (a 35-year timeframe which has remained pretty much constant since when I started studying physics in the late 90s), and it has already and will cost tens of billions more to even just develop a small-scale prototype.

What Greenpeace argues is that a similar investment and commitment to already existing renewable energy would have a more immediate, and more viable outcome, with less risks attached.

They don't actually say that fusion should be defunded, but that at least the funding that is directed to projects like ITER shouldn't come out of renewable energy research.

"space","t5_2qh87","The idea is to use another mission to retrieve the samples. The advantage of doing this is that you will have samples prepared from many different locations and types of rocks, rather than just relying on the samples available at the landing site. I also think you overestimate the difficulty of transferring the samples considering that this rover will have an arm that will presumably be able to manipulate and detach the sample capsule itself, the lander could set down a safe distance away (and maybe conduct its own instrument readings depending on payload) and this rover could approach it safely from a few hundred meters away. This allows a bare bones sample return mission to have a much greater impact than it would be able to without its own dedicated rover. Even if the samples are never sent back to Earth it's still a robot that's as capable as Curiosity and it will be able to make more observations of each sample as the scientists analyzing the data request them.

One candidate for this sort of sample return mission is SpaceX's Red Dragon, which was a proposal they made to NASA to return a small sample for the least expense possible (they estimated the total mission cost at under $600m), and instead of getting a single sample they could return the entire cache of samples from this rover. If not SpaceX, a similar mission could be based on experience with other proven NASA technologies from Morpheus (automated precision landing) and Stardust (small capsule for high return velocity).","1406851911"

SLEEP is the biggest problem night workers have. 

Your room should be as dark as possible. 

You should maybe buy some comfortable ear plugs. 

a face mask helps. 

Try not to do to many things after you get out unless you cant help it. 

The more you see daylight the harder it will be to get to sleep.

Dont exercise after work it makes it harder to sleep.
 
Dont eat after work, you will gain weight fast. (or at least i did) 

Aim to have a routine

Eating and weight gain.

I agree that a person who recreationally gets an abortion is definitely a huge problem and should be dealt with. In what manner they should be dealt with is beyond me and for a different discussion.

You HAVE to do this. It's probably going to be really really hard, but you simply must. Your beautiful dog would not want to see you like this, so honor his memory and start the process today, please.

I'll grant that #1 is interesting, but it's not useful. I don't believe #2 is helpful, because, to make any alternate implementation worth using, you have to deal with the XS problem.

To deal with the XS problem, you either embed libperl and adopt a new problem of marshalling data between your new implementation and libperl, or you spend the time designing an alternate extension mechanism for Perl to replace XS, deploying it across the CPAN, and waiting several years for enough of the CPAN to have adopted it that you can do useful things with your XS-free implementation.

I go to an IHOP. Not the fanciest of dining establishments mind you, but they're open and the coffee is hot. I slide into a booth and the seats haven't been wiped down from the last family with 7 kids that were here. I'm a patient guy, so I brush off the seat and keep on keepin' on.

Darlene stops on over to the booth and takes my order quick enough, even though she has a full dining room and the other tables are clearly impatient. S'all good, I've got coffee and I know pancakes are coming.

I look over my shoulder and I see a young couple complaining with Darlene about their order, apparently they ordered it with Whipped Cream on the side, and it doesn't look like the picture, and they have places to go and she is ruining their entire day. The manager steps over and politely asks them what's wrong with the order or service, and they both just roll their eyes (you know, because they're acting) and exasperatedly say 'We are never coming here again'.

Of course their food is comped. The manager profusely apologizes for their mistreatment. The couple leave the restaurant having not paid for a dime of their 90% consumed breakfast and hop into their H3 LandWrecker™.

I sip my coffee and wonder if there is justice in the world. Just as I begin to lose hope for humanity, Darlene comes into view with a plate of hotcakes and some sad bacon on the side. I thank her as sincerely as I can, and with as little urgency as possible, ask her for a refill on coffee when she can get around to it.

&gt;Can you tell me more about basal for dietary 

basal? take bolus for protein. basal is consistent
err, well it actually depends on your insulin sensitivity.
on keto, you have to inject insulin (if you make no insulin at all) for protein more so then on a mixed diet.
for me, personally, after i got everything leveled out on ketogenic diet, ii injected 4, 3, 2, 2 units, for each meal starting from breakfast (4 meals all together). each meal was approx 30grams of protein.. with practically no net carbs. (where as now on a mixed diet, i inject protein amount x 0.04 = units) i'd assume this would be the same for you if your insulin sensitivity was similar to mine, you made no insulin, and body composition was also similar. either way the trend of pattern would be the same regardless


so why the discrepancy between the numbers if its the same amount of protein?  well one reason is early morning cortisol (amongst other things), increases gluconeogenesis, also protein is glucogon promoting also and that has variable effects. that response drops as time goes on during the day.. its actually a complicated process im not gonna explain it unless asked directly about a specific...","1406851926"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","&gt;about exclusives, I do not agree that greed is solely to blame,if Nintendo did not have these exclusives then the Wii would probably not be selling at the quantities that they are currently

Let me get this straight: They are not greedy, because they do it to sell consoles. 

...

&gt; and also if all 3 console platforms sold the same games, the cheapest Platform would get a larger number of sales over the other 2, then those 2 companies would go bankrupt and then the cheapest company could then skyrocket the prices and then for consumers it would suck, now the three companies I spoke of were the three big console manufacturers and What ever effects consoles could effect PC's.

Simple: No.
tl:dr of long: Theres no single manufacturer of PCs, they are open. The death of all consoles is in the best interest.

This ruling only pertains to birth control.

From the opinion of the Court: ""In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer's religious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.""

My brother and I went to Islands of Adventure for one day of the celebration to see what we could of the new Diagon Alley before it opened and to get a look at the Harry Potter expo thing that was apparently going on.

Unfortunately, the expo only let a sixth or so of the people waiting in line into the actual expo, so we were sunk. We walked away disappointed, expecting to miss the entire reason we came to the park.

Luckily, as we were leaving the park that night, we saw the Harry Potter logo emblazoned upon a huge screen above the stage, where hundreds upon hundreds of people were standing, waiting for something. We joined them, standing outside the gate to see what was going on.

We waited for about an hour after the park officially closed until, finally, Matt Lewis, Evanna Lynch, James and Oliver Phelps, Devon Murray, and Mark Williams walked onto the stage. We got to see then answer questions about life on set and favorite parts of filming, but my favorite part was when Oliver Phelps was trying to decide his patronus and the audience shouted out ""His brother!""","1406851928"

But it's a cycle, I'm sure if you ask those militants they will explain they carried the attack because Israel did something else a few months earlier...

Yes, they arrested hundreds of people who were in no way connected to the deaths of the teens.

&gt;I do think Israel is trying to hit those specific locations, but mistakes do happen and not all the armament Israel has is as advance as you might think (I believe the biggest number of Israeli soldier casualties happened when a 1960 APC carrier broke down and was attacked, not quite state of the art).

Then as I pointed out, they have a legal obligation to find another method.

&gt;You linked to the entire icrc document which is rather long (and it's rather late) but if your talking about attacking civilian it specifically talks about ""Intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population"" if you look at the video I linked to in my previous post you will see that in some cases the lunchers are located right next to houses - even the most precise attack can cause collateral damage. In that case Israel can either decide to stop attacking those lunchers, or risk civilian casualties. 

The relevant section is 2 (b) (iv), which I copied in full in the post above this one.  It is specifically a war crime to launch an attack that will cause incidental civilian casualties which are grossly excessive when compared to the concrete and direct military gain.","1406851933"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","That's true, Razor should beat both of those heroes most of the time, but at least they put up a lot more of a fight than most. I probably shouldn't have mentioned them, you are right. 

I will say though that they can both capitalise on the Razor making mistakes. Viper can take advantage of a long range link by slowing and breaking it, which means he is free to win the lane until the cooldown is back. Similarly, if the Razor is dumb enough to not deal damage to Druid's bear before linking it he can recall it for a free cool down. You can also just bring the bear back and while he is chasing it lay into him with a bunch of auto attacks then skiddadle before he turns on you.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","I have to admit, I have yet to find anything that makes the companion app useful:

* Checking your stats etc. is far more useful on the web where you can share them with others; you don't need a mobile app for this.
* Same goes for looking at other users’ info.
* The grimoire interface is terribly confusing. Throughout the beta I tried using it a few times and each time gave up, not sure whether it was broken or just missing content (because it was the beta)
* There's a map of the tower *in the game*. The only reason to use one outside of the game is because (inexplicably) you can't bring up the tower map unless you talk to specific NPCs.
* Status of your bounties, great! Just like bringing up your inventory. Again, why do you need a mobile app for this?
* Stats etc. that all are more useful on a website.
* 3D models, kind of cool although they seem to have very different lighting/shading to the in-game ones (they look far more metallic and shiny) and for some reason your guns don't show up.

On top of this, the overall experience of using the app feels *very* un-iOS like; since iOS 7 there's been a common convention that swiping to the right means ‘go back’, but despite there being lots of places where you'd want to go back a page, the only UI for this is a back arrow in the top-left, which replaces the main menu, so in order to open the menu you have to first hit back. If you're several levels deep, this means you have to tap the arrow multiple times. Maybe it's because the app was built for Android first, but it certainly doesn't feel like a native experience.

One positive though, I'm glad to see they got rid of the tap to start splash screen — that was some annoying stuff!

I suspect that the companion app will come into its own once clans are being formed and people are trying to organise raids; being able to invite your friends to a raid directly and notify them on their phone is definitely a killer feature, but other than that I'm really not sure there's much here that makes the app essential.","1406851937"

The first was one of my players when I was running a Pathfinder campaign. They were sneaking around a guard tower, trying to get the key to get into the castle and chambers of a corrupt mayor. At the top of the tower, they were going to fight a very tough battle against the captain of the guard and several guards he would call in. When they got there though, the group's alchemist surprised me by announcing he was making a Stealth check to get next to the captain. He rolled it and got a natural 20, so I let him sneak past the alarm spell I had placed. I had concerns about them one-shotting him, but the boss was pretty tough and had a good fort save, so I figured he wouldn't die from being coup de grace'd by the alchemist. Plus, this alchemist was my most resourceful and inventive player at the time, so I wanted to see what he would try. He whips out a liquid sword, a test tube of chemicals that hardens to a crystalline blade when exposed to air, and abruptly shoves it down the throat of the captain. I was stunned, but I rolled with it. It broke open and razor-sharp crystals erupted throughout the man's esophagus, killing him instantly. 

There was also the time the same group was getting whaled on by some bandits. The alchemist drank a mutagen to get stronger, then ripped a small tree out of the ground, and swung it like a 30-foot maul, crushing the bandits. I almost gave him Great Cleave for that one.

My favorite goes to a monk I played with. There were three of us: him, a sorcerer, and me as a cleric/fighter. We were fighting a wyvern at the time, and it was destroying us. The sorcerer got stung and went down to the instant-death poison. I had taken a pretty good beating and was running low on heals. The monk was alright, but as the tank and healer, if I went down he was a goner. I don't remember how, but I got knocked prone and it looked like we were going to get TPK'd. All of a sudden the monk throws himself at the wyvern and attacks its tail. He rolled a natural 20 and ended up breaking off its tail. He then used his Throw Anything feat and whipped it back at the wyvern. Another natural 20 and a failed fort save later, the creature was slain. That monk later ascended to become a god of baking. Praise be unto Bingles.","1406851940"

"flying","t5_2qm1t","You should be able to start logging flight time from day 1.   In most cases the theory and the flight training are mixed - you'll sit with your instructor and get some ground school where he'll talk about some concepts, then you'll go fly for a while and practice the concepts.

My flight training was all pay-as-you-go.  At the end of each lesson I wrote the a check for that lesson.  It would usually be about an hour, but could be a little more or less.

While you don't have to have all the money up front the more you have available the better.  The more frequently you fly the faster you'll learn and the better you'll retain what you learned.  Most people recommend doing 2 or 3 lessons a week if you can afford it.  Once a week is probably a practical minimum.

You don't want to do what I did.  I started in 1984, and flew about twice a month.  In 1985 I flew six times.  In 1986 I flew once.  At the time I couldn't really afford it, so I just took a lesson here and there when I could.  After 1986 I didn't fly again until 2003, when I decided I could really afford it this time and started again.  Got my license about 6 months later.","1406851942"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","This is from the wiki, I'm not as familiar with Jack so ill leave it up to you guys to determine the comparison. 


Speed is directly related to the strength of muscle. As good a shape as he's in, a powerless Spider-Man can bench a fair bit more than his own 165 lb weight, he could bench 200 lbs without his powers. His powers make him 100 times stronger. And increasing the energy/strength available increases the speed by the square root of that figure. Therefore his powers only make him 10 times faster. Which given even the average for his physical acuity, puts him at approximately 100 miles per hour for short sprints. He can run at over 45 mph quite a while at his peak ability.

Spider-Man has reflexes 15 times faster than normal humans. He has enhanced energy resources for his strength and those higher energies manifest all the way down to his metabolic intracellular processes, the nerve conduction velocity of his nervous system is faster simply by sheer brute energy resources. Spider-Man is able to respond to stimulus in a virtually instantaneous manner. He is frequently able to dodge automatic gunfire from multiple sources provided he has some distance between himself and the source, and is able to move with enough room to generate necessary momentum.

Spider-Man is capable of incredible feats of superhuman agility. Agility is not so much an attribute as it is a combination of attributes, many of which Spider-Man has at vast levels. His super-strength and speed allow him to do the necessary movements. The fact that his ""web based"" tissues have much higher elasticity despite their strength gives him amazing flexibility. His superhuman reflexes help him adapt to any changing environment with vast rapidity. They also allow him to find equilibrium almost instantly in any given situation. This enhanced nerve efficiency is also applied to his cerebellum, allowing him superhuman coordination and aiding his balance. Also an increase in proprioreceptors and an increase in their sensitivity aids his coordination and balance even more so. His stamina with movement is similarly enhanced, and he can keep himself moving quickly for nearly an entire day. This agility is augmented and enhanced by the spider-sense, rendering him even more capable of feats of miraculous evasion. All these things combined give Spider-Man super-agility.","1406851943"

"WoT","t5_2rdg1","I'll take the opposing position. Yes, it parallels the way the queen of manetheren died. That being said:

1) She is not ta'veren - she comes in direct contact with three people who can see ta'veren, and none of them identify her as one.

2) She does not speak to Rand from T'AR - Remember, when this ""conversation"" happens, Rand is *outside the pattern*. The pattern cannot effect him. TAR is a part of the pattern, intersecting it. In addition, he hears another voice in his head: Tam's. He is hearing *what he knows Egwene would tell him if she were there*, it is not Egwene communicating with him directly.

3) Egwene has not done enough to be bound to the wheel. These are *the top 100 badasses of all time*. The queen of Manetheren is not bound to the horn, even though she died in a similar manner. No other Amyrlins are bound to the horn, so that's not enough. What else did she do? Defeat Taim? That's not so great. Defeat Mesaana?

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Part 1) 
Evil can not exist if the creator if OOO
Omnibenevolent means all good, therefore;

All Good does not include Evil

Evil Exists

Creator is either not Omnibenevolent, or Omnipotent


2) Omnipotent means unlimited power

Every omnipotent being MUST have free will

God does not have free will

God is not omnipotent

If you do not have free will, it means your ""will"" is limited, which contradicts the definition of ""unlimited power"".

3) Free Will is the root of all evil

God designed Free Will as it is

God chose to put Evil in the Free Will

God created Evil


The first 2 argument basically lacks knowledge. It seems to me, OP does not know meaning of Omnipotent and Omnibenevolence. Because Omnibenevolence contradicts Evil, which automatically refutes argument 1. And not having free will is contradictory to Omnipotence, because ""unlimited power"" simply means no boundaries. 

In the 3rd argument, God creates people, a being who is OOO, knows that free will includes evil in it. So;

Either God does not know Free Will is the root of all evil (contradicts omniscience) 
Or he does not have power to create Free Will without evil (contradicts omnipotence)
Or he does not want to (contradicts omnibenevolence)

If we accept god as OOO, we have to remember that he is also the one who created Free Will, therefore if Free Will has evil in it, then it leads us back to God as a creator of Evil.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","Ok, I think you might be a little confused about what epigenetic modification of genome expression means in the context of adaptation to environmental circumstances.  Let me just lay it out for you, and then you can ask for clarification of anything I say that may be unclear.  Promise I'll come back and answer to the best of my ability.

When a population of a single species (ex. a herd of deer) encounters a less than ideal environment, say an unusually cold winter, the individuals that are least able to withstand the cold will be more likely to die off, and the ones that survive to the next breeding season will be more likely to pass on traits that make their offspring cold-tolerant (say, thicker fur).  That is why the cold winters would be referred to as ""selective pressure""; the environment has selected for specific traits in the next generation.  The result will be a new herd of deer that is better adapted to cold winters, and over many generations of the same selection, those traits are reinforced, and the herd may accumulate enough genetic differences to not be able to breed successfully with any individuals of the original deer population that they may encounter.  They are now considered a separate species of deer, by at least one measure. 

The nature of those genetic differences that have helped them adapt to the cold can be of two basic kinds: They can consist of changes in the DNA sequence coding for genes that make ""fur thickness"" proteins, OR, they can be modifications of the DNA that don't change the sequence, but that change the manner in which fur genes are expressed, for example shutting down genes that make ""thin fur"" proteins, or turning on genes that make thick fur proteins.  

The DNA sequence changes are called mutations, and they occur basically randomly when DNA is replicated during cell division, and may be either helpful or harmful; the helpful mutations are the ones that are selected for survival and to be passed down in the face of selective pressure. The DNA changes in gene expression that don't change the sequence are what is known as epigenetic changes; these are less likely to passed down to the offspring because the epigenetic modifications of DNA are reversible, and are mostly ""reset"" during development of the embryo, but that is not always true.  Epigenetic mods do occur in response to environmental circumstances as well as biological signals during embryogenesis, so they are not so random.

The important thing to realize is that, evolutionarily speaking, both genetic and epigenetic changes will lead to the same result under selective pressure:  If those changes are helpful, they likely will be propagated in the subsequent generations, so they both lead to adaptation to the environment.  That is why your original post (with all due respect) does not quite make sense; universal use of birth control is selective pressure that should lead to greater fertility in a population, not infertility, because without people whose fertility is not completely blocked by BC use there would be no passing down of any traits, whether they are genetic or epigenetic.   In the parent  generation, there may very well be epigenetic changes in response to BC use, but if these changes lead to lower fertility, then they are ""dead end"" adaptions, because they are less likely to be passed down.

Sorry for the ramble, but I can't make it any shorter.","1406851945"

If your company is serious about giving you a shot as a developer, I would take it and work on any formal education on the side.

To give you an example, I started out as a developer 6 years go w/o a degree of any kind. I was in a school but wasn't doing well and decided to just find work and finish part-time. It was a struggle and I worked as a production support/maintenance programmer for a while but as my industry experience grew, the fact that I hadn't finished my degree became a non-issue.

Background: recently I had a debate with an atheist in my workplace. Though I felt I did reasonably well (Thanks to God alone), I borrowed a copy of *The Case For Christ* form my church library. I felt the spirit lead me to give a copy to this atheist today, his last day on the job. 

I felt the Devil fight me the whole way. I had intended to give it to him yesterday, the last day we worked together, but was unable to purchase it in time. Today my local Christian bookstore was out of copies, and I had to search around to buy one. I very nearly missed getting out the door to see him this evening. I feel the Spirit is telling me the Devil is fighting in his heart, whispering to him to throw away the book. I know not why God told me to do this, I can't even explain it to those I love, but I know that this is His plan.","1406851946"

1. What type of Access Point do you have?
2. What type of encryption are you using?
3. Where is the AP located? House/Apartment
4. Are you using 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz?

A couple of suggestions based on my questions.

- the randomness of the lagging seems to me it could be WPA/WPA2 key regeneration, which shouldn't normally be noticeable unless you are connecting with old WIFI technology. I am betting on this one being the issue...if you have access to configuring the AP, you should be able to increase the time between key regeneration.

- if you live in an apartment where neighbors may have their own AP's, you might be experience co-channel interference. If you laptop wireless NIC supports 5Ghz, this may help avoid some of that interference.

- Making sure your AP is using 802.11n may help.

Anyways, it fell onto my toe ripping the back of my nail out of its bed, and cutting down into the front/top of my toe with the nail.  when i got to the hospital 50% of my sock was pure red, and i had two socks on that day. The nail was off... And the bone was visible so they stitched it up, slid the nail back into its bed. Eventually a new nail pushed the old one away but they wanted to cover up my stitches. 

Those shoes made any white socks get blood stains for a long while, had to wear strictly black socks from then on. ","1406851951"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Israeli politicians are highly defensive in international affairs. In other news, the sky is blue and the world is round. 

If any of you were to live in Israel, or even know a decent number of expat Israelis, then you'd know that Israeli social culture in general, *particularly* amongst politicians, is characterized by marked outspokenness. Where international politics are involved, a reflexive and defensive reaction to criticism invariably makes itself evident also. The same reigns in many nations worldwide; Russia is an example---see Putin's political conversations for an example. Not that I'm comparing Netanyahu to Putin, but you get the point.  

That said, there are politicians worldwide who, outspoken or not, often open their mouths far, far too wide, too often, and too stupidly for their own good and for that of the country they claim to represent. Netanyahu is one such individual.  

I made this post exclusively in an effort to educate on on Israeli social culture and how it sometimes manifests itself in politicians saying such things. I don't intend to get involved in this discussion, both because it and all others like it are a waste of time, and indeed this one seems to have immediately moved from ""Netanyahu said this"" to ""Israel is the worst nation in the history of the universe"" (I'm guessing that the typical Hitler references, for example, began immediately; I haven't looked). It would be a pointless affair to engage in event if I had even a tiny bit of interest in discussing this situation on the Internet.

When i think balance i think of those slack-lines (http://www.wikihow.com/Walk-a-Slackline). I think that (and things like it) and MMA (specifically Judo and BJJ) are probably some of the best non-traditional training methods for NFL players wanting to improve their balance and body control and ability to use your own weight/momentum/points of weakness or your opponents weight/momentum/points of weakness to your advantage. 

Only think i kinda disagree on is Turbo. While yes he is a short yard back, i do think he has he can get free around the edge (or through a big lane) and bolt down field for 30+ yards. Its just 3 out of 5 times it happen in the 2013 season he got called back cause some O-Lineman held (and i think 2 of those 3 times the hold did not effect his getting to the open field and gunning it).

"BPD","t5_2qqdp","It is caused by neglect. There are various needs a child has that they can neglect whether they love and protect them from trauma or not.

I'm not a psychologist or anything, not that it's necessary in order to understand how the human brain works. I have really strong ideas on it. I don't think it's always caused by trauma or the typical idea of what neglect is. When I talk about neglect I also mean like, spoiling a child too. It's a tough on to explain without writing a huge essay on it, but I strongly believe that it is caused by the parents and how they raise a child - you can love a child and give them everything and never hit them and they could still grow up messed up because the foundation of BPD is based on discipline and self discipline. It's based on things that a child failed to learn growing up.  That's why they do cognitive behavioral therapy for it - It basically teaches you that you can change your thoughts and control your impulses.   That's why in a lot of group therapy classes and homework assignments for treating BPD are based on concept found in Buddhism, it's all about learning self control and learning to change your thoughts. 


You might find this offensive: the foundation of BPD is based on a lack of self discipline. (self discipline is usually taught to a child through a parents example, that's why a parent can give a child everything including love, etc and still pass on poor self discipline tendencies.  full circle.)","1406851956"

"ouya","t5_2uhbj","Ok, I see your problem.  The Ouya needs to plug directly into the router, which I guess you already did because they're next to each other.  If you left that as a wifi connection though, definitely run an ethernet cable between them.

The real problem is that your PC doesn't have as strong of a connection to your router as the Ouya does.  If a wired connection is out of the equation then this can be fixed one of two ways.  One of these is upgrading your internal wireless card.  The other is a media bridge.

If your PC has an older wireless card it might not be powerful enough for media streaming, or playing games online, or a lot of other things.  You can try to upgrade it to something like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833320181) if your router is capable of wireless ac.  If you only have wireless n, then you might as well go with a cheaper option like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166082).

If your router isn't capable of wireless ac or wireless n, you need to upgrade your router.  Not just for this, for everything.  At this point in time anyone stuck on wireless g or b makes me feel sad.

The media bridge option is less elegant but cheaper and faster.  Basically, get a device like [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833999018) and run an ethernet cable from it to the ethernet port on your PC.  Place the media bridge in a location that gets good wireless signal and connect it wirelessly to your router.  Also, turn off your wireless card on the PC, you won't need it while you have the media bridge.

It's basically an external wireless card, but it plugs into your ethernet port so your PC will see it as a wired connection.  It's also almost as fast as one, so it's the next best thing.

If these options don't fix your problem, and improve the quality of your PC's internet connection in general, then nothing will.","1406851956"

They have a lot of money from corporations and from individuals.  This might be their last chance to get a NFL team in the city since I think the NFL considers Buffalo and Toronto to be in the same market, they'd want 1 team for the region to rally behind.  Bon Jovi's been doing the research and shmoozing for years with owners and now with the commish.  And they just give up now?  I think they're willing to overpay just as much as Pegula is.

I do think the price will reach a point where Bon Jovi would no longer be able to be the front man but rather a partner.  One of the other partners would have to overtake being the majority owner.  But I do think they're going to bid everything they can as well to try and bring in what would be Canada's first and for now... only NFL team.  I think for them that is as big or even bigger accomplishment than keeping the Bills in Buffalo is for Pegula.

 (^24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.)

A quick roundup of some others:

1 Peter 2:24 Good News Translation (GNT):

^24 Christ himself carried our sins in his body to the cross, so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness. It is by his wounds that you have been healed.

1 Peter 2:24 American Standard Version (ASV)

^24 who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.


1 Peter 2:24 New Living Translation (NLT)

^24 He personally carried our sins
    in his body on the cross
so that we can be dead to sin
    and live for what is right.
By his wounds
    you are healed.

1 Peter 2:24 Young's Literal Translation (YLT)

^24 who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed

-----

Note that in Isaiah (OT) the tense is present i.e. ""we are healed"" and in 1 Peter (NT) the tense is past i.e. ""we were healed"". So what changed? Jesus went to the whipping post to pay the price for our healing. 


So in terms of 1 Peter 2:24 tenses, so far only the NLT shows present tense.

Some more translations:

 1 Peter 2:24 New International Version (NIV)

^24 “He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.”


1 Peter 2:24 Wycliffe Bible (WYC)

^24 And he himself bare our sins in his body on a tree [Which he himself suffered, or bare, our sins in his body on the tree], that we be dead to sins, and live to rightwiseness, by whose wan wound ye be healed.

 1 Peter 2:24 Amplified Bible (AMP)

^24 He personally bore our sins in His [own] body on the tree [a][as on an altar and offered Himself on it], that we might die (cease to exist) to sin and live to righteousness. By His wounds you have been healed.","1406851960"

This is impossible and absurd because a thing is only worth what its purchaser (the retail store that you bring it to) is willing to pay for it. People do not understand this and feel cheated when they get 10-15% of what an item would sell in the store for, because they aren't in business. Many people work office jobs and are so far away from margins and the like they honestly have no clue about selling anything and staying in business.

People would bring me musty books and expect no demand money for it. Even if its a title I already had five copies of, the entitlement was impossible to overcome. No amount of reasoning would work. People felt continually cheated not understanding that especially in the online world what a thing is listed for can be miles from what it eventually sells at.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Pretty good. It's an RPG shooter, which to me feels a bit like an FPS Diablo in a Sci fi skin. Comparisons to borderlands with a bungie feel are fairly accurate. 

The worlds are fairly immersive with their take on spawning. Enemies are dropped in by ships a la covenant dropship, and fast travel (mounts) are hover bikes that appear to be upgradeable. Same with your ship that brings you from world to world. 

The shooting still requires skill.  There's an elemental resistance/vulnerability mechanic similar to borderlands, and there are bosses that simply can't be beat directly (spider tank in the beta) without coordination or a fair amount of time. 

There's also a PVP section called The Crucible which seems like it could be fun. I was chewed up and I consider myself fairly good at shooters (over 5:1 K/D in Planetside2, Halos, CS, Battlefield, Titanfall). I did only try a few times at a low level though, so auto balance or just sheer ignorance could be that. Clearly people can get really good. 

I played titan class which was pretty tanky, abilities appear to be unlocked by level without much in the way of choice or configuration (so far, cap was lvl 8).

If a spammer that was (temporarily) banned comes back after a few days, no one is going to still be active in that thread to see it defeating the whole purpose of spamming.  If he gets caught again, he'd be gone for 4 days.  But if he's a legit poster that happened to have been mistaken for a spammer he will be back without causing pointless ill-will toward the site.

And ya as far as working out I really have to get on that. I was popular in high school but always a little bit of a loser. I was always the guy who was great at making friends. Huge friend group, I knew a lot of people. But could never date. I wanna change that in college and maybe my last year could be a good learning ground. Somewhere I can fail and learn from my mistakes without worry cause I'm doing an extra year and literally my whole grade is gone. Its kind of a last year fresh start. So I'm definitely hopping to nut up and be the guy I always wanted to be. And well I would love to have a relationship but I'm totally down for casual flings to. I was always to nervous to do it because I didn't wanna loose friends over the possibility of the proceeding drama. I was also kind of insecure about my looks. Ive got this idea that I'm the ugliest human being and that its unatural for me to like girls which I know Is dumb and self destructive. But I'm getting better and I'm trying hard to be comfortable in my skin. Friends were never an issue. But for dating I came off insecure and probably awkward because I was suppressive of my true feelings. I kind of shamed myself from fear of judgment over my looks. The thing is I want romance in my life but I'm terrified of either fucking things up or offending someone with my sexual feelings. Its definitely something I gotta work on before college. Also I would like to be taken more seriously. I was a bit of a push over because I was unconfident. Didn't wanna cause drama or step on anyone's toes which I want people to start seeing me more as a leader and taking me seriously when I speak, more assertive. Sorry for the emotional dump I know your not my tberpaist. Just thought it might add a little more info to base advice off of. Thanks for reading and I'll definitely try and take your tips!

"AustralianPolitics","t5_2snwr","&gt;But not on the first day, first week, first month. Surely you'd agree we need to support these people, we can't just drop them in and expect them to fend for themselves.

Of course, do you know the cost of these things? I think that you've got the wrong idea on how much money one can get on Newstart, how much rent assist and the cost of public housing. Relatively to other countries it is much smaller, on top of that you again are bringing the subject down to cost efficiency. 

This is why a cost analysis of the two systems needs to be done. If you're going to play devils advocate then you too must be aware that there's no information on how much the current long-term incarceration system is costing, yet alone a cost analysis of the opposite. Also you have to equate the wages of health professionals, security, officials and their flights (security often fly between Australia to their shifts) with the cost of $800 a fortnight that a family receives on newstart and FTB.

&gt;If we're going to have a real discussion on viable alternatives we've got to live in the reality of today. And the reality is that any proposed solution has to be sold to the Australian people.

A lack of teaching compassion and critical thought in schools is a major issue to me. You can't sell human toll to a population that hasn't experienced a threat to that. 

&gt; Because the issue isn't as simple as it sounds

I never once, despite you continually telling me there is no easy answer, suggested that there is an easy solution. Obviously it's not an easy solution and there's no way that a reddit post could solve it, nor do I suggest that this can be done.

&gt;Rudd was the peoples champ and he failed badly at selling it.

You and I have differing memories of Rudd on this. I remember his solution being only slightly better and still involving long stays in detention centres.

What about the numbers? 15,000 people per annum is a tiny amount when you think that [the birthrate](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3301.0) in Australia (especially if you take in to account the roughly [11.4 in 1000](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4125.0main+features3210Jan%202013) deathrate).

There is no debt crisis, there's no reason to be counting pennies vs human toll at this point in time. If we were in a massive recession then yes, we would have to look at costs. Currently however these concerns shouldn't be so high on our list as ensuring that we come as close to balanced a budget as possible.","1406851965"

I recommend watching some videos about predictive programming by Alan Watt (not Alan Watts, he's cool too but different).  Alex Jones' Fall of the Republic was rather good I thought and Alan Watt is in there and I thought that he really brought the documentary to the next level when speaking about this.

Think of it like this: people used to worship the Heaven stars but stopped doing that and now worship the Earth stars.  There is a Masonic principle called As Above So As Below.  Hollywood has created a distorted reflection in the stars that they create.  People are still following stars.

They've also hijacked our tribal instincts where we evolved to emulate the most successful people in our group.  Today following Earth stars as the proposed tribal leaders does not benefit us and is largely detrimental to our well being.  This scenario is scientifically created for maximum exploitation.  Interestingly there were other varieties of hominids very close to us who were basically as intelligent as we are but were less social in the sense that they didn't care to be in huge groups and to blatantly copy each other so vigorously.  Homo Sapiens evolved the inclination to sort of almost worship their most successful members and this ended up giving them an advantage that won out.  This made sense in smaller groups where you could actually see this person in real life and where the successful people could even know who you are.  Today this is very much not the case and when it does happen often times common people shit themselves with excitement.

Extramarital affairs might be less frowned upon in Dorne, but nothing indicates that every Dornishman takes a mistress, or that Elia herself agreed with this stance. Elia is still Princess of Dragonstone (or so I'm assuming she would be titled), and her status derives solely from her marriage to the heir and her mothering Prince Aegon. Having the prince father a son on another - even if she remains just his mistress - is extremely dangerous to her position; the greatest threat to the Targaryens before Robert was the Blackfyre Rebellion, when a bastard son of the king tried to claim the throne for his own.","1406851971"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't know what I'd put as BEST, so I've listed a couple of points that immediately come to mind. good luck getting a new job!

- register all of your details with whichever government unemployment scheme your country has. I got laid off and because I had savings, I decided that I wasn't in a rush for a job. after 3.5 months I ran out of money so had to get back into work. it was only then that I realised that I never applied for unemployment benefits and missed out on a couple if thousand dollars in doing so (though saved myself the headache of actually getting that money from the government's steely grip).

- get your CV in order (and touch base with the people you were using as referees to check if they were still cool to act that role and to let them know they might be getting a phone call).

- I was reluctant to do this initially, but post to facebook that you are seeking work. it's amazing how many of your friends will comment or inbox you with suggestions or friends of friends who are looking for someone just like you. the internet advice sites always go on about networking with potential suitors - you already have a social network up and running, so why not give that a crack?

Yes cars can kill people, bikes...maybe not, that does NOT mean that the driver of a car is responsible for the actions of a ""nonlethal commuter"" ESPECIALLY when those actions are in defiance of the law. The law is not relative nor does it make distinctions between ""lethal"" and ""nonlethal commuters"" in regards to laws such as stop signs and traffic lights....you need to stop, just like everyone else...ESPECIALLY since ignoring those laws is more likely to get YOU (the cyclist) killed by ""lethal commuters"" ...which is not an actual term by the way.","1406851973"

Most holy Virgin Immaculate, my Mother Mary, to thee who art the Mother of my Lord, the queen of the universe, the advocate, the hope, the **refuge of sinners**, I who am the most miserable of all sinners, have recourse this day. I venerate thee, great queen, and I thank thee for the many graces thou has bestowed upon me even unto this day; in particular **for having delivered me from the hell** which I have so often deserved by my sins. I love thee, most dear Lady; and for the love I bear thee, **I promise to serve thee willingly forever** and to do what I can to make thee loved by others also. **I place in thee all my hopes for salvation** ; accept me as thy servant and shelter me under thy mantle, thou who art the Mother of mercy. And since thou art so powerful with God, **deliver me from all temptations**, or at least obtain for me the strength to overcome them until death. From thee I implore a true love for Jesus Christ. Through thee I hope to die a holy death. My dear Mother, by the love thou bearest to Almighty God, I pray thee to assist me always, but most of all at the last moment of my life. Forsake me not then, until thou shalt see me safe in heaven, there to bless thee and sing of thy mercies through all eternity. Such is my hope. Amen.

Are you really going to try to apply your Western ideals to those types of people?

""Oh, they just want freedom to vote.""

Really? Like in all the other Arab countries with freedom to vote and functioning democracies? Stop applying your Western mindset to other people with different values! Some people really couldn't care about freedom and are content living under dictators and imams that can control the legal system. We might not be able to understand it, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.

"OpenTales","t5_2zq6q","Gen's GWA-S custom only took about ten seconds to boot, and the actuator power-up sequence was mercifully fast.  She made a mental note to check the logs and find out how many sorties this old beast had flown as she strapped into the partial seat and harness, then locked her boots into the bindings.  She slid her old helmet on and checked through the status indicators lining her main screen, then lifted the mech from its seated position.  Apparently, they used the scaffolding here like they did at the mech factories, but a Clan heavy assault ship had less storage, so the mechs were usually stored in a seated position until the drop.  This was Gen's first time taking off from a carrier, literally the opposite method of deployment than she was used to, even in orbital maneuvers.

Gen waited for Demann to leave the flight deck before she followed, throttling up slowly.  The GWAs didn't have a ""flight mode,"" because that was too complex, which added to maintenance times, but they did have a pair of folding wings to help stabilize their flight.  In all honesty, they weren't the best things in atmospheric flight, but it was as capable in the air as it was on the ground.  She quickly caught up with Demann's mech and locked her own mech into a spot near and behind his right wing.  *If Gwen and Gillian were here, we'd at least have a full formation to fly in.*

Gen glanced at the comm window to verify the few people that were on that channel still had their video feeds in it, which they did.  ""Base, this is Baker.  All five-by-five.  Scans have a clear view of ten miles on the surface, no live hostiles at the moment.""

*Shit, I just jinxed myself.*  She checked the status of her rifle, and her reactor output, but the readouts were the same as when it'd been sitting on the deck, all perfect.","1406851992"

 When someone starts vomiting blood in the US they seek medical help. In these African communities afflicted with it they seek a witchdoctor. 

In the US an infected ebola patient is aggressively quarantined in properly sterilized clinics(meaning you don't have a choice, they'll call in the national guard if need be), in western africa they do blood rituals with living and dead victims. There's no concept of hygiene in these communities, there's abject fear of doctors(many communities outright think ebola is a conspiracy and fake), what hospitals they do have are prone to unsterilized conditions due to lack or resources. That's why it actually spreads in western africa and why every time it reaches some foreign shore it gets promptly contained, generally to the person who brought it in.

"Smite","t5_2stl8","You already can climb MMR/ELO by playing the current system. I know this from experience. I was 1900 ELO at one point, im around 2600 now(Note: this was after my first like 50ish games where i tanked from 2300-1900, and climbed back up).

In order to climb you have to be consistently winning, which comes from better play, the better you play, the more likely it is to win. It really doesnt matter if your team sucks, its up to you to make up the difference, if you cant do that then you are where you should be. 

Now i understand leavers, and trolls, there isnt anything you can do about that, the system will weed them out as it can.

The point being, you CAN climb ELO, its up to you as a player to up your level of play in order to do so.

Also, thats incorrect at the bottom. You gain and lose Tribute points based on your MMR vs their MMR. If you're favored to win, you'll gain less, if you're favored to lose, and then win, you'll gain more. It also has to do with your MMR to your Division difference. The max TP you can gain however from what ive seen is 17, no matter how high your MMR/ELO is you'll still gain a max of 17TP.","1406851998"

However, I believe that you don't need to do that (unless you want to). You said yourself that you did everything else and didn't smoke, so my question is this: why can't the same aspect be applied to drinking? Look at how many drinks it typically takes you before you really need that cigarette. Cut yourself off at one less than that. For me, it was usually after my 3rd glass of wine. When I quit, I stopped drinking on my second glass. I still had a craving, but the omission of that 3rd glass made it a little easier to get over that craving.

From the opinion of the Court: ""In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer's religious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.""

""If you feel you've paid the price,

And your wounds should cease to heal

And everything you love in life spins like a winding wheel.

If you should wake to find you're abandoned,

And the road you've traveled leads to a dead-end

When death creeps in to play it's part,

You must follow your heart,

You must follow your heart.""

- *Against The Grain*


""I fear I'll die from complications, complications due to things that I've left undone

That all my debts will be left unpaid, feel like a cripple without a cane

I'm like a jack of all trades who’s a master of none

Then there's my father he's always looking on the bright side

Saying things like “Son life just ain’t that hard”

He is the grand optimist, I am the world’s poor pessimist

You give him burdens sometimes and he will escape unscarred""

- *The Grand Optimist*


When you cry a piece of my heart dies

Knowing that I may have been the cause

If you were to leave

Fulfill someone else's dreams

I think I might totally be lost

You don't ask for no diamond rings no delicate string of pearls

That's why I wrote this song to sing

My beautiful girl

They both have the same core, so I am assuming they core at the same place. This is the most math ive done all summer.

As an example, I absolutely love the American version of the office, but every time I try to tune into the British version, I feel like I can't follow along nearly as well, and that I don't understand the jokes, or the characters nearly as well as I should be.  I bet that'd change if I spent a month of two in the UK, 

though I would think there are alot of American shows that are the same way to British audiences.  Like, I wouldn't be surprised if many times during our stuff you guys were thinking  ""what? I don't get it...that made no sense""

Then I can turn around and absolutely love shows like Ali G, and my boyfriend is obsessed with Downton Abbey. I think the majority of Americans that watch TV are just impatient and they want a quick payoff with little effort, they probably aren't paying for channels like HBO, AMC, etc, and that's why so many mindless cartoons have taken over the main time slots.

To start, Marfan syndrome killed my grandfather with aortic dissection at 30 in 1970. I never knew him, so I can only guess at what I lost there. My marfanoid mother died from an infected mitral valve at 35, when I was 10. When my brother was in 5th grade he had to be put in a back brace to try to save his spine, it didn't work. Before that, though, I had to watch as my little brother recovered from two painful surgeries to apply bone grafts to his hips to keep the joints from breaking through the back. A year later he had a 15 hour surgery, nearly an emergency one, because his spine was actively collapsing from scoliosis. At 25, his hips are already arthritic.

My own personal experience would be having to deal with orthodontic equipment to make my teeth resemble something reasonable due to overcrowding, and nowadays, daily medication, too many doctors for my liking, and of course, constant pain from minor scoliosis and damage I did to my knee and self consciousness from stretch marks and my distorted chest (this causes a bit of a problem with bras, too). I damaged my knee from pursuing something I loved before I was diagnosed- exercising. Lifting, to be specific. I love to be active and exercise, and I can only do neutered exercise thanks to this disorder.

I have other reasons for being childfree, but this is a big one. I simply can't justify giving a child this kind of life.","1406852011"

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence#Gender_aspects_of_abuse

I don't think that people should be so quick to jump to conclusions. This is an MRA group that has somewhat of an anti feminist agenda in my opinion and what's interesting is not any single study but the consensus of the experts in the field. In my opinion this study does not aim to be scientifically rigorous but aims to get mass media attention. A lot of organisations will do this where they make a crappy study and them use it to get media attention. It's not difficult to get the medias attention if you have a big organisation like this behind it.

Considering that there's been a long history of wife beating being more or less generally accepted or even encouraged by society it would surprise me if this turns out to be true. Nevertheless it is important to remember that men can also be the victims of abuse and that this is an issue that perhaps deserves more attention than it has so far gotten.","1406852011"

*For he finds fault with them when he says:[c]

“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,
    when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel
    and with the house of Judah,
9 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers
    on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
For they did not continue in my covenant,
    and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.
10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
    after those days, declares the Lord:
I will put my laws into their minds,
    and write them on their hearts,
and I will be their God,
    and they shall be my people.
11 And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor
    and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’
for they shall all know me,
    from the least of them to the greatest.
12 For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,
    and I will remember their sins no more.”

13 In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.*

I am very grateful for your comments, and will bring them back to the study later today.

Do you think if they had put ""caucasian"" instead of ""western"" that would have been better? There are options for ""other"" and asking information involving country as well. The data is codified later including breaking out ""other"" into types that are reported. I'm asking so I can bring these back to those who created the survey and have them make it better.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Realistically, people were just making fair arguments that pedophiles aren't specifically child-molesters and convicted rapists aren't necessarily always guilty. 

The point of /r/circlebroke is to discuss trends and circlejerks of reddit. Something doesn't have to be wrong to be a circlejerk and to be discussed on circlebroke. 

The 'pedophiles are the real victims' jerk, is one of the most common circlejerks on reddit, and thus fodder for circlebrokers.

While it might be literally true that pedophiles aren't all child molesters;

* this discussion is stupidly overjerked on reddit because it appeals to their contrarian, second-opinion bias, when really it's not a contrarian view within the context of reddit.
* who gives a fuck that people think pedophiles are scumbags? Redditors apparently 'if it's treated as a disease/orientation, they can seek help'.
* Don't underestimate the number of pedophiles and child molesters on reddit who would like to normalise and reduce the stigma around their orientation, a lot of these comments are coming from pedophiles.","1406852015"

Honestly, a lot of anime people are listing (especially the slice of life shows like nichijou and non non biyori) are more geared towards teens and young adults. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them when I was younger since they seem ""so dull"". 

I'd also recommend shounen series like [Shaman King](http://myanimelist.net/anime/154/Shaman_King) - anything you thought was interesting when you were a kid.

I pre-ordered watchdogs,  God,  what a console port,  got burned real bad and it's been so much time since release and it still got stuttering problems,  but they  sold well,  just like how they will sell lots of units on Farcry 4, EA and ubisoft have horrible practices along with Activision,  the so called AAA game makers,  horrible sale tactics,  have no problem pirating them unless it's  an amazing game which blows expectations (like far cry 3), then I buy it from steam. 
So,  pirating  serves a purpose,  for people not having access like in India (where I used to do all my pirating,  once I started earning  in Australia,  I bought everything  till I got burnt by Diablo 3 and watchdogs,  where I decided not to pre-order anymore ) where one game costs 10-15 %of your monthly income,  imagine paying $300-400 for one game. 

Man,  sorry for long rant,  typing on phone,  so not even properly formulated.

Not just being called stupid for believing.  Yes, I am Christian but I'm not here to suede you in any way. Just discuss and learn. I like the way you talk about how everything in the universe seems to work. And is ""designed""That is something that's big for me and my beliefs. I don't believe everything is as it is because of randomness. I noticed how someone said you don't know what an undesigned universe is, which I guess is a valid point but we don't know and I think that's for a reason and I also agree that god is so omnipotent that are understanding falls short, we believe that everything has to be created, what if that's not how things work. Not everything is created some things just are like god. The same
Reasoning goes for the free will argument. People say how can we have free will if god already knows what we will do.

"howtonotgiveafuck","t5_2tna8","This was something I never thought I'd over come but just did recently. I believe what kept me from goin was thinking about people hearing my stream of piss. When I was worried I would think my stream was either too trickly, sounded like I pouring a thin stream of water into a bowl, or blasting into it like a supersoaker. I remember worrying people might think ""thats not how its supposed to sound when someone take a piss"" as ridiculous and irrational as that sounds. I'm not exactly sure how I got over it but I believe it's trying multiple things over time. I would say it took about 4-8 months to get where I'm at (I still have these moments happen occasionally but when it does I give way fewer fucks than ever before). Here I'll try to lay out the steps for you:

1. It begins I go in, and things just aren't flowing. My mind would race. I'd close my eyes and think ""no body is paying attention. No one gives a fuck about your piss stream. These people don't matter to you"". Sometimes I would zip back up and go on still having to pee. 

2. I started going in stall but even then sometimes I would get shy piss and would have to wait till everyone left the bathroom till I could go. I literally remember feeling like I would have to explode the entire time hearing the bathroom door creak close and the second I did it would burst out.

3. I began doing that^ but at a urinal

4. One day on campus I was walking around with headphones in and I went like it was nothing. There was someone at the urinal right next to me and I went without even thinking about it. I didn't even realize until I walked out of the bathroom.

5. I started trying my new headphones technique all the time. But since I was aware of it sometimes it would work, sometimes it took a full minute to get flowing, either way I could tell I was making progress.

6. I started trying to go to the bathroom in places I couldn't have headphones (like work) and I would think of a song and play it in my head until I got lost in it to take my mind off my piss anxiety. It was really hard at first but with perseverance I slowly noticed things were getting easier and easier to go. I had finally found a way to distact myself using only my thoughts.

7. I still had trouble when I was at restaurant with my friends, or at a friends house. This one took way longer. Most of the times I was too damn scared to go in the bathroom and would wait until I went home. The worst was at bigger parties and there was actually a line for the bathroom. It seemed the only time I could piss was after a few beers and even then I would have to convince myself ""your drunk as shit, everyones drunk as shit, no body gives a damn about your piss stream"". Since I actually was intoxicated it was easy to believe I was more fucked up than I actually was.

8. I started trying to go earlier in parties. Before I would wait atleast 5 or 6 beers in to go, which would leave me feeling pretty buzzed and easy to trick myself. So I started trying to trick myself a little more sober each time. Going after only 3 beers, 2 beers, 1.

9. I was slowly getting better at going in more intimate settings but found difficulty when in a particularly calm quiet enviornment when I was sure people would hear me whether they realized it or not. These were probably the most difficult times to overcome. I took everything I had learned from going in public and started using it in the settings. Getting lost in a song, another thought, convincing myself I'm intoxicated when I wasn't at all. And again sometimes it would work and sometimes not. And a few people actually did bring up to me whether I pissed or not and I straight up began telling them I was piss shy. This is probably what helped me most actually.

10. Eventually after doing all of this over a long period of time I finally feel like I can piss in peace.

Hope this helps someone. 

TLDR: stick it out the entire time, don't be afraid to go into the bathroom no matter whose there, don't worry weather you go or not, can take weeks or years depending on how commited you are to 'fix' your problem.


Edit: to add onto step 1, I used to leave the bathroom and try again within an hour or 2. Then I would try again after only 30-45 minutes. I remember a couple of times when I went into 1 bathroom, couldn't go, and went straight for another (if you're in a place with multiple restrooms)

  Choices please.

  &gt;I am replaying skyward sword and while that game has it's share of problems the motion controls are my biggest gripe. I hate them. All the forced wiggling and the bad combat controls with the sword and bowling moves with bombs are bad and force me to sit in one straight position or else I fuck up a lot of times.

  Really? I (or my kids) had no problems with the controls. They were always responsive and pretty fun. The only forced controls that felt weird (and forced) was swimming. I spent most of my time sitting pretty relaxed on the couch once I realized I didn't need to recalibrate my wiimote everytime I pointed away from the screen (you can use wherever you're pointing as the center).

  &gt;How much easier and more relaxing would it have been with just a stick and a button.

  I'm sure it would've been fine, but I liked the fact Nintendo tried something new. I *loved* the sword controls (even though it *wasn't* pure 1:1).

   &gt;Focus on a great game please, Nintendo

  Opinion, but I thought the game was great. It had a beautiful art style, a good story (for a Zelda game), pretty much the **only** character with any development in the entire series (Groose, the man!), and as I said.. I felt the controls were real responsive and fun.

 [**Great Flu Epidemic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great%20Flu%20Epidemic): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __1918 flu pandemic__ (January 1918 – December 1920) was an unusually deadly [influenza pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic), the first of the two pandemics involving [H1N1 influenza virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H1N1).  It infected 500 million  people across the world, including remote Pacific islands and the Arctic, and killed 50 to 100 million of them—three to five percent of the world's population  —making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history.    

&gt;Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults. Modern research, using virus taken from the bodies of frozen victims, has concluded that the virus kills through a [cytokine storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm) (overreaction of the body's [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system)). The strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups. 

&gt;Historical and [epidemiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology) data are inadequate to identify the pandemic's geographic origin.  It was implicated in the outbreak of [encephalitis lethargica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica) in the 1920s. 

&gt;To maintain morale, [wartime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, Britain, France, and the United States;  

&gt;but papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain (such as the grave illness of [King Alfonso XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_XIII_of_Spain)), creating a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit  — thus the pandemic's nickname __Spanish flu.__

The highest ranked team Texas beat was 13th (Oklahoma State) while the highest ranked team Cincinnati beat was 14th (Pitt).

Frankly by any objective measure Cincinnati should have been in the National Championship game, I think they matched up better against Alabama (who I believe was a weaker team than Florida that year) and with Brian Kelly coaching and spirits high I think it would have definitely been a competitive game, definitely moreso than the Florida game.

LOL! Turn them into anime cats haha cute :D

As for keeping outdoors cat, I can relate because that's how I took care of one a long time ago when I was in college :D

One day while going home from school, I decided to pass by a tree to ""punch"" it a little bit. At the time I was big into kung fu movies so you know how the minds of boys are lol! So anyway, while punching and shaking the tree, I noticed a cat was watching me. I like cute little animals so I decided to try and make it come to me.

I said ""Come here cat!"" while waving at it. Surprisingly, instead of being scared and running away from a monster like me, it calmly walked towards me. I decided to try and pet it (my first time to pet a cat, I never had cats before!) and it was very friendly!

I went home and I realized that the cat was still following me. I decided to let it into my home. Then an idea struck my head! ""She has no name tag, she's a wild cat! Now she'll be my friend!"" I thought! :D

I gave her a bath (she got mad) but eventually she became clean. She was a beautiful cat! She had orange and silver all over her fur. I gave her the name Nikki! :D

I couldn't really keep her in my home because I was afraid that she'd pee and poo all over! I decided that during night time when I'm sleeping and during the day when I'm at school, she'll have to stay outside of the house. I didn't know any real way to train cats, but I just thought that maybe, if I fed her outside the house, she'll get the idea that I want her to stay there.

Fortunately it worked! Instead of running away, Nikki actually came back to my place whenever it was getting dark. She's actually pretty smart for a cat! When there's people at home, I'd let them watch after Nikki instead of leaving her outside.

What I really loved about Nikki was that whenever I got home, she'd run to me and try to climb me lol! Other times, she'd just on the wall and try to bounce towards me! She's really cute and funny! 

When I was working on my thesis and I had to type a lot on the computer, Nikki would jump and sleep on my lap. She kept me company and entertained me while I kept working. 

Eventually, little Nikki, while on a date outside, got pregnant! She even brought the daddy cat with her! I named the daddy cat GARFIELD because he's all orange and FAT like Garfield :D Garfield's very aggressive though and he'd meow-scream at me a lot. He calmed down whenever I gave him food lol :D

A few weeks later, Nikki finally gave birth to 4 kittens :D They were all very cute and it was fun watching them trying to learn how to walk lol :D At that time, I decided to let Nikki stay with her kittens inside the house so that they'll be protected properly.

Too bad I had to leave home and go somewhere far away and leave them behind. Nikki, Garfield, and the kittens are still in my old neighborhood and they've probably created a new generation of cats already.

Anyway, I think cats can recognize places, otherwise, Nikki wouldn't have known how to come back to my place at night everyday. I guess as long as you treat them like friends, they'll be your friend as well :D","1406852045"

A town that can comfortably employ/support 10,000 residents with 15,000 residents has the problem of keeping that extra 5,000 occupied in some way.  Typically, that extra unemployed population comes with higher crime rates.  If you can't find a way to employ them, then maybe helping them get to where they can be employed would be worth considering.  I'm not saying that local governments would fund this directly, but they may not oppose it.

Nobody is asking Israel to disarm. That'd be insane and not realistic. However I don't agree that if Hamas disarmed that the blockade would life and Palestinians would be given their statehood finally. 

Also, you speak of an ""attempted genocide"" by the Palestinian people on Israel, yet it's the Palestinians who have been dieing in scores of people over the last few decades. I agree other arab nations have not done much for our cause, which is sad. Maybe some humanitarian aid here and there, but not much else usually.

I'm pro-innocent civilians, so of course I'm pro-Palestinian. (not hamas)

As for storage, if they are absolutely dry (stems snap rather than bend) and they are kept in an absolutely airtight container, there isn't really an expiry date. They should be sweet for a good long time.

Look into Lemon Tek, which will result in a faster onset and a potentially stronger trip. However, the biggest factor for me with shrooms is if I have recently eaten or not. Eating food with my shrooms significantly decreases the strength of the trip, IME. Eat them on an empty stomach for best results.

THC is cool with shrooms, IME. Unlike with acid, where smoking amplified my trip, smoking just chilled me out on shrooms. I pesonally recommend it if you are having a bad trip too.","1406852049"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Your point about the blockade has no bearing on what we're saying (that Israel illegally occupies Palestine and as such is restricted in the amount of force it can use; the same restrictions don't apply to the occupied people, per international law). Hell, the blockade dates back to 1989 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Blockade#1989.E2.80.932004) with a THREE YEAR gap when it wasn't active. I'm seriously not sure what point you're trying to make by saying that Gaza had about 3 years of psuedo-freedom in the middle of decades, nor what this has to do with the rights and responsibilities of an occupier.

Lastly, I'm not sure if you're just uninformed or if you need to open your eyes beyond the propaganda you're feeding on, but they didn't just leave in 2005, they set plans to expand their borders. Chomky explains it much better than I could :

&gt;What is called `the disengagement plan' was an expansion plan. And it was not hidden. An expansion plan. It was perfectly overt. I can't say it was deluding anyone. And I think the day that [Ariel] Sharon announced the plan to leave Gaza, I think it was that very same day that [Benjamin] Netanyahu announced the number of tens of millions of dollars that they were spending in the West Bank. And a couple of days later, Sharon met with [Shaul] Mofaz to discuss plans for further expansion. He announced new developments in this E-1 area, they extended the settlement, the separation wall, which was of course intended to be some kind of border. The building has continued, the road system is expanding, in fact by now it's public, they don't even conceal it anymore, to make an entire separation of the populations, with a Jewish road system of nice highways and a Palestinian road system.

Look at the old Euripides Loeb volumes by A. S. Way; they're just tortuously archaic-sounding. It was just the fashion at the time to render Greek poetry into native English meters and rhyme, just as it's the fashion nowadays to be more fluid or to disregard meter entirely to produce a fluent and natural-sounding translation.","1406852050"

http://www.handgunlaw.us/states/california.pdf

Signs do have the force of law if they're in a place that's off-limits. IE: Any School

“No Firearm” signs in California have no force of law unless they are posted on property that is specifically 
mentioned in State Law as being off limits to those with a Permit/License to Carry. If you are in a place not 
specifically mentioned in the law that is posted and they ask you to leave, you must leave. If you refuse to 
leave then you are breaking the law and can be charged. Even if the property is not posted and you are asked 
to leave you must leave. Always be aware of the possibility that responding Police Officers who may have 
been called without your knowledge and may not know the laws on trespass etc. could arrest you even if you 
are within the law. 


I considered moving to California many times, and it always boiled down to this.

However, I think it's better to answer this question in a different way. Japanese people are really big on souvenirs, and every place has its signature foods and souvenirs. I think it would be groovy for travelers to try those things. Every big train station will have a souvenirs shop, which is pretty straightforward.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I'm sure that people have felt the entire spectrum of emotions when they don't get what they pray for. 

I think of an episode of M*A*SH (I'm really deep, as you can tell, bringing up sitcoms in theological discussion) called ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?"" A bomber pilot in the Korean conflict gets shot down, and apparently has a psychotic break. He believes he's Jesus Christ. They call in a shrink, who starts asking him questions. He starts gently crying, denying that he's a bomber, asking why he would ever hurt his children. The shrink asks him ""Tell me, is it true that God answer all prayers?"". He responds ""Yes"" a tear rolls down his face, and he nearly whispers ""sometimes, the answer is no."".

It's a lot like that for me. I don't directly ask God for a lot, and sometimes when I do, I don't get it. But that's fine; it's not for me to question God. And if he doesn't exist, then I'm a lot stronger than I think I am, because religion has kept me alive more than once.","1406852056"

"YAwriters","t5_2vtil","**Quick thoughts**

* First issue is I have no idea what happens with our main character. Be specific &amp;mdash; the reader needs to have a clear idea of the action. If it's an explosion, say it. Vague is rarely best, as it could mean the reader is too hung up on what is going on to care about the character and the story.

* The first sentence needs to be great at one thing: convince the reader to read the second sentence. It needs to be clear, concise and specific &amp;mdash; it should ground the reader as fast as possible, it should give the reader a sense of the character's immediate issue, and it should show off your voice. As it is, the sentence is too long and the hook is kind of lost inside it.

* The first paragraph is all about the same message &amp;mdash; it feels as if you're repeating the same idea over and over. Trust the reader to imagine things for himself, and trim everything to bare minimal. The essential for a first paragraph is: the hook, an explanation to the question posed in the hook, and subsequent action. There's room for some description of the setting and character, but be careful to not overwrite it.

* Long sentences and short sentences give rhythm to your writing. As it is, the long:short ratio is too high. Break up the longer sentences. Be concise &amp;mdash; don't use three words when one would do. Use the direct form. Don't try to pack up a lot of information in a single sentence. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Commentary and some examples**

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;My head swam with vertigo as I glanced around the room ^(**1**) expecting the worst^(**2**)--but there was only the glimmering outline of a dimly lit chrome chamber, utterly plain except for the metal platform I was sitting on. 

&amp;nbsp;

**1.** Can you see this isn't in the direct form? First the character glances around, and *then* feels vertigo. Cause     &amp;#8594;  consequence. The natural flow of cause and consequence helps the reader imagine the actions in the right order.

 
*""I glanced around the room and my head swam with vertigo.""* 


Isn't it easier to read? 

&amp;nbsp;

**2.**  This is a different idea, so it should be a new sentence. I also feel the tense is weird &amp;mdash; it'd read better if it were in the past tense.

*I expected the worst, but there was only the glimmering (...)*

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; After a few moments my racing thoughts and heart [ began to slow ]^(**4**) as I took [ deeper and more regular ]^(**5**) breaths ^(**3**), each inhalation tainted with the lingering, metallic burn of ozone. 

&amp;nbsp;

**3.** Try to write this in the direct form and split the sentences.

*I took deeper and more regular breaths. After a few moments, my racing thoughts and heart (...)*

&amp;nbsp;

**4.** Three words where one would do. Began to slow     &amp;#8594;  slowed. 

*I took deeper and more regular breaths. After a few moments, my racing thoughts and heart [ ~~began to slow~~ ] slowed down.*

&amp;nbsp;

**5.** Parallelism is a great tool. As we read *deeper and more regular breaths*, doesn't it feel clunky? The reason it sounds odd is there's no parallel there: deeper is a single world, but you can't write regular*er*. *More regular* breaks the parallelism you were working on.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Thoughts and advice**

&amp;nbsp;

I disagree with the purple prose commentary &amp;mdash; there's some overwriting, but it's not purple territory yet. If you overwrite, the risk for it increases. But one thing is not the other.

There's a lot of potential in the story &amp;mdash; it feels like you started at the right place, which is hard to do, and there's a good connection with your character's feelings and perceptions. 

That said, there's a lot of room for improvement, too. Read about first sentences, and first chapters &amp;mdash; and maybe about sentence structure, too. The first two will give you an idea of what's essential in the first moment and what's not, and the last one is a big tool for you as a writer. 

As soon as you get a good grasp at sentence structure, everything will fall into place. I don't see your style as an author here, but I think after you get the long:short sentence ratio right, and learn to trim your prose so it's concise and clear, it will shine through.

Don't feel discouraged by all I &amp;mdash; or everyone else &amp;mdash; said! Writing is editing. We all need to read on craft and rewrite, and then do it again. Critique time is the time to make mistakes, and it's why writers need critique partners: so agents and editors only see our very best work. :)

If you need some links to good articles on any of the things I mentioned, let me know. I'd be happy to help!

Good luck! ","1406852061"

1. Thanks for bringing light to this point-- I wanted to subtly cue that the main character was the main character once the lyrics started (i.e. after it fades out of black and the female lead watches the couple while getting her belongings out of the car). I also figured because she was the only character who did not have as much fun as the others would indicate her distinction. Before the group reaches the destination, she is solemn in body language. I suppose this was not as obvious as I intended. :)

2. I still new to color-grading but honestly have no idea how to replicate a different look. I agree it is very overdone and want to expand on this. Any recommendations on good websites for learning? :)

"javascript","t5_2qh30","The problem is that if your requirements don't exactly match the assumptions that were baked into the framework that you started with, you will suffer going against the flow of all the abstractions looking for work-arounds. This almost always happens as a system evolves over time and the requirements slowly shift, particularly as new technologies like websockets or new streaming endpoints need to be added.

Frameworks are not very good at versioning either. You can't really upgrade a rails application ala-carte because rails bundles everything into a very large core so many people are still stuck on verison 2.3 even today. With more independent, smaller modules, you can upgrade pieces as you need to and can add new features when you need them without needing to upgrade an entire application with a complete rewrite.

It might be difficult to train new people to work with a custom architecture built out of small components, but:
1. you'll end up doing that anyways as your application evolves around and past the framework architecture over time
2. individual small libraries are much easier to learn than giant ones and you can learn them as you need to","1406852073"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I have actually just gone through a very similar situation, from the perspective of the ex-girlfriend. You must recognize that if/when you decide to start dating, it is a very distinct possibility that your friend may not want to continue a friendship with either of you. This is understandable, considering their history. However, the only thing you can control is how you handle your actions going forward. In my case, we tentatively dated for a few weeks before telling ANYONE, just to be sure we were solid and clear on our expectations. After we were certain that we wanted our relationship to continue, I spoke to my ex to let him know what was going on. It wasn't easy to do, but I was glad to have been the one to let him know. Out of respect for your friend, one of you should let him know what is happening, no matter when you decide to date. Do NOT let him find out from someone else - this opens the door to many potential misunderstandings and hurt feelings. ","1406852074"

"oculus","t5_2uni5","Environmental constraints is one of the biggest reason for this. 80%(random number) of people have their computer desk agaisnt a wall, and there simply is just not enough room from the keyboard to the wall you're facing. For a lot of people it's simply impossible to get 5ft, without offsetting the camera enough to make turning your head one way a problem.

I found the best spot for my situation is mounting it up high above my monitor and looking downwards at me at a 45 degree angle, to maximize the small amount of room in front of me. It's easier with a gamepad where you can back away form your computer, but with KB/M its much harder, and same applies with a wheel or joystick on your desk.

I think one of the best solutions for this would be to have the camera have 2 exchangeable lenses. One more wide angle and one less. As long as there was software implementations to compensate for this I see it as being a fairly low cost solution for the people with space constraints.","1406852076"

* Tranquil boots and diffu on Windranger?
* Tranquil + Refresher on Mirana. - Bad idea.

A close friend who graduated a few years back did a senior project involving an analysis of his uni's web traffic.  Without targeting it specifically (he was looking for inefficiencies in the network) he came away with a host of student-specific data showing individuals doing all sorts of things that violated the student/school's agreement on permissible internet use. 

His school had a very conservative stance on porn - and a large number of students who thought they were operating anonymously were called in for code of honor violations.  There was a warning as you mentioned, but those accounts were flagged and repeat offenders faced expulsion. 

My point here is that the students did not do anything illegal (I don't know if the school looked at P2P back then) and yet they still risked getting expelled at the school's discretion.   

Flash forward ten years and *my assumption* is that web traffic analysis is significantly more advanced.  Pair that with the fact that we are discussing an illegal activity that leaves the school liable and I think the OP is walking a dangerous line.

How is Olic not a striker? van Gaal's favorite lineup up top at the time was Olic at front with Müller as ACM/second striker. The players playing as strikers are strikers for me

I know it can seem a bit strange with what I say about van Gaal's distaste for Gomez as a striker, and you may question how anybody could possibly know that, but it's well documented in the German press. van Gaal was always very upfront about his intentions, and Gomez gave some interviews on the topics of wanting to leave Bayern because he was not happy with being a bench player after the first season. All of this ""causa Gomez"" in his first season at Bayern was plastered all over German media, as Bayern always gets that much coverage anyway and Gomez also was Bayern costliest transfer at that time.

This is all very well known, just ask some other Bayern fans who followed it all, especially the German press at that time if you don't want to believe me. Anyway, I'm off now watching Bayern's friendly","1406852089"

Tienes razón que hay que pensar en el modelo de estado pensando en dar el poder de decisión a la gente, pero si hablamos de modelo de estado y no se tiene en cuenta el nacionalismo como parte de la ecuación no es entender la realidad del momento, yo personalmente si el sentimiento ""Nacionalista"" es verdaderamente mayoritario, lo asumiré, el problema que veo es que hoy en dia se ha provocado de alguna manera ese sentimiento en mucha gente, que no es consciente de que significa el ""Nacionalismo"" y de como desde la casta se le ha sacado un provecho enorme en los medios, dando tema de discusión y enfrentamiento en toda España y Catalunya. 

No quiero que nadie piense que estoy en contra del derecho a decidir, y tampoco voy a renegar de ser catalan ni nada de eso, entre mi familia y amigos hay mucha gente que quiere la independencia, y lo comprendo.

Pero creo que si ahora existen verdaderas opciones de que se pueda conquistar el Gobierno a traves de PODEMOS, una independencia, declarada, bajo gobierno del PP podria ser el final de todo, y yo sinceramente no descarto que Mas y Rajoy no hayan valorado la situación y ya esten llegando a pactos que les beneficien a los dos para seguir con su expolio.

After reading other comments, I think there are some other valid points as well. Without having at least a decent chat feature, or clan/guild feature, finding people to raid with in general could be tedious, especially trying to utilize the in-console communication features just to set something up.

Have there been any Dev reports of better text/voice communication options, or a clan/guild feature to better organize groups of players?

For the casual players, though, as you said, there aren't much options for them to get into them.

From what I've read though, that's kind of the Dev's intentions, though. They don't want it to be a casual thing, necessarily. They want it to be the end-game challenge that separates the casual player from the veterans. At least, that's what I took from the article.

That may seem kind of harsh, but at the same time, it's meant to be the challenge of all challenges. It's not intended for the casual gamer. It's meant for those who have learned well their class and weapons, and are ready to test their skills to the max.

Again, this is my interpretation from the articles I've read, and my own viewpoints, so take it with a grain of salt.

That said, though, I still feel there should be better ways to group together, like with chat channel options, and/or clan/guild options. 

That alone would allow newer, more casual players to group up with each other, to do practice runs of raids, while not allowing those said players to randomly jump into the groups of those who aren't looking for random players.

&gt;  I just find it extremely hard to believe.

Make sense, but the same level of distrust is also true to Israel, and one party is in a much stronger position to move the peace process forward, unfortunately history has shown that Israel does not want peace or a 2 State solution (which at this point is almost impossible to occur), and since the one State solution is even less of an option for Israelis it seems peace is not going to happened until all Palestinians are removed.","1406852104"

"DIY_eJuice","t5_2u91l","I'm happy to give you any help I can!

1. I only use flavors from The Flavor Apprentice (TFA/TPA).  I know that there are a lot of different flavor companies out there, many of which offer higher quality flavorings.  In this sub I found that many people had experience with this line of flavorings, and also that there is a list of the flavorings offered by TFA, along with a rating of the flavor quality and suggested amount to use.  For these reasons I figured it would be a pretty safe bet to start with this brand of flavoring.  I rely heavily on other peoples' experiences.

2.  I'm not a patient person.  I try to let my juice steep as long as I can, but I generally start testing it hours after mixing.  If there isn't much flavor, I'll shelve it and give it some time.  Currently I have some that has been steeping for 3 weeks, I believe most people recommend 28 days unless you use one of the advanced steeping techniques.

3.  I think there is a common similarity between most flavors across different manufacturers.  If someone says, for example, that you should try mixing pineapple and orange together I generally assume they mean to use whichever is my favorite pineapple and orange flavorings.  Usually the flavor manufacturer will be included in recipes if you are wanting to completely recreate someone's juice.  For example, my current favorite is:

* 10% Bavarian Cream (TFA)
* 5% French Vanilla Deluxe (TFA)
* 5% Dulce de Leche (TFA)

This indicates that the flavorings I used in the recipe are from The Flavor Apprentice.

I hope some of that helps! ","1406852104"

I haven't had the experience, and without specific examples I can't really counter, the off-base assumptions that you've mentioned. Marxist historiography's simultaneous strength and weakness is the willingness to identify class-based cause and effects in history. This applies generally, but in terms of Indian theory Marxists have often have the clearest view in a range of subjects. 

Everything needs some degree of reader beware, but Hindu- and Muslim-nationalist trends have outright fabrications or myths as if they were facts. That being said, even with the issues on both sides, Indian historical literature isn't completely barren; Ranajit Guha's *Elementary Aspects of the Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India* is a monumental work.","1406852106"

I wish I had a job where I could earn that much. My best paying job netted me a $34,000 salary, but I was laid off from that in 2010 and haven't been able to find good employment since. 

I'm not sure what the lower limit for ""good employment"" is, but if I take the left over money, divide that by two to get the single persons spare earnings, then take that away from $38,250, the person in question would have to earn at least $30,784.19 each in order to break even. Minimum wage is $10.40 an hour. If you work 40 hours a week for 52 weeks, that's $21,632.00, not minus taxes or anything. To get to the break even point this couple would have to earn at least $14.80 an hour per person. 

This isn't an argument for or against the OP, I just wanted to lay out some more information. I'm single without children, so the numbers in the infographic would be different for me, some things higher, some things much lower or non-existent, so I can't really draw good comparisons out of this for me personally.

And, if you want to be technical, which you seem to, you said Mexican cartel. There's no proof all 59 of those are members of the cartels.

But, in this case, I will be willing to say that I cede your point that 28 killed is not a high number and that it might be true that Mexican cartels have killed more than 28 US citizens, but it certainly is not a fact. I would argue that if the Mexican cartel was lobbing mortars into an American city there would definitely be a US response. So, I still think the overall point you're trying to make, that Israel's response is disproportionate and wouldn't be repeated by the US is wrong.

Unless you really just wanted to point out that Mexican cartels have killed more than 28 people and that's all you were trying to say. But I don't think that's the case. Overall, it's a pretty bad analogy.","1406852110"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Child Therapist here. Ironically, most of my referrals come from CPS and DCS. I'll weigh in and say that your kiddo seems like a prime candidate for therapy. From a family perspective, she is ""the canary in the mineshaft."" That means that something in the family is awry and your kiddo is trying to let people know. My guess: she's acting out for any kind of attention (good, bad, whatever) with low self-esteem with poor skills to ask for what she really needs. I'm also super interested in why she chose to not throw you under the bus.

I understand your reluctance to engage your kiddo in therapy. It sounds like she's developing a dangerous way to try and get what she wants. And as a mandated reporter, she may try and use me to file CPS reports. Even if I think it's bogus, once I hear those words, I've gotta make the call. I know it doesn't make it any better on your end. For the concern about ""things being back to normal,"" any therapist worth their salt will include you closely in the treatment process and see that what the kiddo is saying and what you're saying don't match up. Quite often, kids try to make everything look okay, when that is far from the truth. They just hate getting in trouble and looking like a bad guy.","1406852110"
"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","for anyone still lurking, I found this and it's a good explanation of what I am trying to say.

Sex is NOT love. Love is not sex. You can have sex and not be in love. You can be in love and not engage in sex. A man may hate you and still have sex with you. Be wise. Using sex to manipulate a man will eventually fail. It is self deception to think that giving him sex will make him love you. True Love will never force you to engage in sex. A man who doesn't love you will not change his mind because of sex. If he tells you to ‘prove your love’ by having sex with him. He is only using you. If he is in it for the sex, ‘better sex’ will take him away from you. Making yourself his ‘sex slave’ is foolish. Love will never shame or degrade you. If you have made the mistake of trying to use sex to buy this man, now is the time to re-assess your relationship and build it on the right foundation. If he gets married to you because ‘the sex is good’, it will be fatal to your marriage. Let him get married to you because he loves you, honors you, feels a strong emotional, mental and spiritual connection with you and wants you to spend the rest of his life with you...","1406852110"

I'm technically a gold star bisexual. I'm physically but not emotionally attracted to men, so I've never slept with one, although I would like to do it once so I know what it feels like, and then go back to girls forevermore.

"comedy","t5_2qhkm","I hate this attitude that says ""words are meaningless."" Words are how we communicate thoughts, which are basically 100% of the human experience. We use them to build our society, and shape the world we live in. Words don't exist in a total vacuum. Language affects people, and has consequences. 

I'm going to choose the word ""faggot"" for this discussion. I'm offended by that word because it's part of a widespread idea that gay people are inferior or wrong. That idea is harmful to society, and using that word perpetuates the idea. When you use that word casually, you're telling everybody else with that idea ""it is okay to think this way."" You're also sending a message to everyone who's been negatively affected by that idea. You're reminding them that people consider them inferior or wrong. You're letting them know that you don't care about their struggle. Even if you're not using it in a negative way, you're still reinforcing the idea that they're ""different"" and ""other"" than ""normal."" It offends me when people act that way. It's rude and inconsiderate at least, downright bigoted at worst. 

In the words of XKCD, ""Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can make me think I deserved it.""

The mayor of her friend zone scares me :P and It's ultimately what I'm trying to decide whether I'm that or something more.

In Africa, the most well of people do not have the standard of living that people in the West have, and the problems they face are so much more real and threatening, and yet this idea of getting down is not even an option or an after thought. Here, where, in the big picture, everything is perfect for most people, I see so called depressed folk everywhere. Hell, like I said, doctors tried to tell me I was one of them. Bullshit.

For example if you look at the release notes of the [latest driver](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/68801/en-us) from Nvidia, you'll see a bunch of games listed that got improvements with that specific driver update. The last driver from Nvidia was finished about a month ago, but hasn't been released until yesterday because Microsoft took so long to do their [WHQL testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHQL_Testing).

"cincinnati","t5_2qt1k","My best friend is gay. He lives in West Chester. He's originally from a small town in the south of Ohio. 

He lived in Dayton where it is definitely more gay friendly than Cincinnati. Columbus even more so than Dayton. But he loves living where he does. He spends a lot of time in the city. He says anything is better than where he grew up because it's your typical small town where everyone knows your business and probably isn't okay with it. 

My friend is left alone and hasn't had anyone mess with him about his sexuality. Although he does say he is afraid to be expressive about it at work. There are a lot of people in Cincinnati who could potentially ruin your opinion about our ""open-mindedness"" but there are a lot of us who do a great job of compensating for it. 

Things move slow here. People aren't typically ""loud and proud"" but ""out and proud"" for the most part is not at all a problem in my observed experience. It does matter suburb to suburb how people will react. Do your research about each area. I hope you do move here, find a like-minded group of friends and fall in love with Cincinnati.

Section 4. [**Applications**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_braking#Applications) of article  [**Engine braking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine%20braking): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;As soon as the accelerator is released and the throttle closes, engine braking comes into effect as long as the wheels remain connected via the transmission to the engine. (A [clutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch) or a [torque converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_converter) can disengage the wheels or absorb braking energy.) The braking force varies depending on the engine, but also what gear the vehicle is in (Generally, the lower the gear, the higher the braking effect as long as the wheels continue to maintain traction with the road surface).

&gt;Engine braking passively reduces wear on brakes and helps a driver maintain control of the vehicle. Active use of engine braking (shifting into a lower gear) is advantageous when it is necessary to control speed while driving down very steep and long slopes. It should be applied before regular disk or drum brakes have been used, leaving the brakes available to make emergency stops. The desired speed is maintained by using engine braking to counteract the gravitational acceleration.

&gt;Improper engine braking technique can cause the wheels to skid (also called shift-locking), especially on slippery surfaces such as ice or snow, as a result of too much deceleration. As in a skid caused by overbraking, the vehicle will not regain traction until the wheels are allowed to turn more quickly; the driver must reduce engine braking (shifting back up or disengaging the clutch on a manual transmission) to regain traction.

&gt;

"ultimate","t5_2qnym","Sponsored by WFDF I imagine. It's my understanding that USAU sponsors NGN to film college nationals and TCT events? Maybe contracted is a better word.

&gt;For WJUC you could get all the games for 12 Euros.

Is Sky'd doing something similar for WUCC? $16 is a steal for like 14 games.

&gt;If they do need money to break even with a small profit, then shouldn't they make sure that people have to pay for the games in highest demand (i.e. finals)?

That makes sense from a business perspective. However from a cultural perspective, this is the *world championships of ultimate,* held every four years. It isn't just another tournament. Charging to watch the culmination of years of international development in the sport just seems... disappointing. It'd be like NBC instituting a $3 paywall to watch a gold medal olympic game or the Superbowl. Sure, it's super cheap, but do you see how that could be frustrating? How that could limi

I mean, I don't want to sound like some cheap scumbag. I'm not the one paying out of pocket, flying to Italy, etc. I'm grateful that there's even a stream at all and will happily pay Sky'd for pool play games. And the most optimal solution would've been for WFDF to contract out Sky'd to stream the games. But at $2.69 the profit margins have got to be too low to be seriously effective, and that's where I get bummed.

Like, I was so happy this year when USAU got with ESPN3 and streamed college nationals semis and finals for free. Granted, the stream wasn't that hot, but it meant that so many people could watch the best ultimate with ease. This paywall is going to deter: (a) youth without credit cards, (b) folks who don't trust the service with their credentials (IIRC you pay inside of the embedded media player, a bit sketchy tbh), (c) folks whose method of payment is not supported by the service, and most importantly (d) newcomers who understandably aren't going to pay for something they know nothing about.

I was happy for USAU's contract with ESPN3 because it meant that friends and strangers who didn't play ultimate could see what it was all about, potentially hooking them on the sport. I bet 95% of the people who watch the WUCC finals are going to be existing ultimate players or fans. So I hope you can see why that makes me sad.","1406852125"

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt; It's some pretty impressive mental gymnastics to read the above and conclude the SPLC does not hold /r/mensrights as a misogynistic site.

As Mark Potok of the SPLC later clarified, ""*it's a diverse group, which certainly does include some misogynists—but I don't think that's [its basic] purpose.*""

If a group contains *some* misogynists and that misogyny *isn't* the groups basic purpose, can the group as a whole be considered misogynistic?

If the answer is yes, then I can be justified in making the argument that /r/feminist and /r/feminisms are *misandric* sites because they contain *some* misandrists even though the membership of those groups are diverse and it isn't those groups primary purpose.

And no, I don't consider those reddits to be misandric because the memberships of those groups *is* diverse and misandry *isn't* their primary purpose.","1406852130"

"katawashoujo","t5_2tb50","Rin was first thinking about changing the relationship when she hugged Hisao while alone on the roof. She decided to confess her feelings in the Dandelion field the following day.

Instead of that happening she got sick and high. Hisao missed the meaning behind those drug induced ramblings of what she wanted. Then she completely fumbled the [standard](http://www.tofugu.com/2013/10/23/japans-love-confessing-culture/) ""I think I'm falling in love with you"" [speech in the field](http://i.imgur.com/IzEJFjZ.png). Hisao's answer was ""Slow down. Take your time."" Hisao was referring to the conversation but Rin never thinks that way. Rin thinks all things simultaneously so she thought he meant both the conversation and the relationship. And that's exactly what she was doing right up to the atelier.

Here are some other thoughts:

* Words and art aren't the only ways to communicate. Actions are another.

* You get on Rin's path by not pursuing any girl. If you pursue Rin by choosing *""I just kinda stuck with her, I think.""* You are thrown off Rin's path. You don't even mention Rin if you say that.

* Rin doesn't like to socialize. She does like to socialize with Hisao.

* Hisao is Rin's first emotional relationship. It is not her first physical one.

* Rin figuratively and literally throws herself at Hisao when she's high and her inhibitions have been lowered.

* Rin doesn't like to hug so much to the point she kicks out. Rin hugs Hisao first. Rin kisses Hisao first.

* Rin never holds back, puts up walls, runs away or lies like the other girls. Not once. She's always giving it her all even when her all is not enough or it appears on the surface she is withdrawing.","1406852131"

In fact, when I'm in an area known for panhandling, I make it a point to not carry cash so I can say ""I don't carry cash.""  Salt Lake's panhandling problem is worse than most places because of the whole Mormon charity thing.  

Today, of course in the Wal Mart parking lot, I get approached by a panhandler.  Decent looking guy, but a panhandler nonetheless.   I veer, give my usual schpeel and get into my car.   

As I'm pulling out, I spot him again, just standing there and the voice pops into my head ""What if it's for diapers?""   I paused and then a memory is recalled of a single father friend of mine who had to shoplift baby tylenol to help his sick daughter one night.  

So I drove over to him and offered him the $5 I keep in my car.  He thanked me profusely and started to jog off towards his RV. 

The situation has stuck with me all day.   I NEVER give to panhandlers and the ""what if"" has never happened to me before today.

I chalk it up to diff'rent strokes, but the last thing I listen to Zappa for is his monotonous blues songs. I put Muffin Man in this same category. Any song with heavy reliance on the minor third or using the minor sixth (makes me think of Rush's Tom Sawyer) just bores me.

That leaves you only option as branding a MFI cable and that is a hard task.  If you want a list of the thousand or so MFI factories go to Apple's website and download the list.  Also, apple owns the trademark for ""lightning"" so I would tread lightly when using that word.  If you use it on Ebay, you will eventually get pulled.  I would plan on 25-30% of your cables not working.  I sold these cables before, I sold battery cases before and I will never sell either again. ","1406852136"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I think your comments on the culture industry are apt and done well.

However, avoid generalisations such as ""Adorno felt"" the reason is because while you have definitely over-simplified Adorno's work, you can avoid this by changing the grammar to ""I feel that Adorno"" or ""Adorno to me means..."" 

By saying ""Adorno felt like this"" you imply that you have read all of Adorno's work and you understand it all and thus you have boiled it down to these principles, which as implied in the comments is not the case, Adorno is a lot more complicated and nuanced.

And yes, I agree with the irony of this post. Remember how Adorno said culture is becoming disposable and that reality has to resemble films? Well some might say the same of your post on Adorno, that you have reduced something very complicated into a easy-to-read disposable summary. The Frankfurt school were not joking around and they were serious elitists. 

I would encourage you to read more Adorno by all means, and to trace his origin in Marxist thought and definitely to read Hegelian thought too, if you are the author of this link's post.","1406852136"

He's different now and has grown into his own in terms of always having that confidence whether or not he's struggling, but his level of confidence is not at the ""FUCK YOU ALL IM SHOOTING THE BALL"" levels that Kobe's or Westbrook's have been since their rookie season.

&gt;___Étant donnés___ (*Given: 1 The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas*, French: *Étant donnés: 1° la chute d'eau / 2° le gaz d'éclairage*.) is [Marcel Duchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp)'s last major art work which surprised most of the art world who believed he had given up art for chess almost 25 years earlier. It is a tableau, visible only through a pair of peep holes (one for each eye) in a wooden door, of a nude woman lying on her back with her face hidden and legs spread holding a gas lamp in the air in one hand against a landscape backdrop.

""Israel also claimed that Hamas had forced civilians to remain in the Gaza City neighbourhood of Shujai'iya after the IDF warned them to evacuate ahead of its assault on Sunday. Civilians were being ""held as hostages"", said Peter Lerner, an IDF military spokesman.

**These claims have not been backed up by independent reporting from international journalists covering the war from Gaza. Instead, dispatches from the ground have presented complex reasons why some residents did not evacuate from Shujai'iya and other areas targeted by the IDF. Many said nowhere in Gaza was safe, so they saw little point in abandoning their homes.""**

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've been interested in radio since I was a kid.  I remember seeing a Yaesu FT-101 in a magazine in a shop when I was a kid and thinking that was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.  Life then quite promptly got in the way and I messed about a little with CB radios in the late 70's and early 80's, right up until I left school and joined the military.  Cut to 2003 and I was looking for something to do with my kids and I challenged them to take the test with me.  My step son and I both passed and from that point on I continued to study, take tests, including the Morse code proficiency test that was at that time a requirement.  I'm married to a British citizen so by benefit of being over there on a frequent basis, I got my license over there as well.  

My best experience would just have to be all the friends I've made just from getting in to the hobby.

I've had the great fortune to be involved with a fairly large international club and as such provided a prop that has been seen on the ABC television show 'Last Man Standing.'  That was pretty cool.

I've gone out storm spotting, giving real time ground information to the local NWS office, I've assisted in the flooding in Winona County, MN a few years back and was the initial net control for the evacuation of St Charles MN to shelters due to an industrial fire.

"Swingers","t5_2qyei","Oh, it's definitely lazy and rude. That's just disgusting to be quite honest. My wife and I are pretty blunt, and if we saw that stuff upon meeting them, we would have had a few drinks and/or dinner and then went our separate ways. I'm sure you two would have as well except that you drove 4 hours to meet them. 

We have our ""safe saying"" that means we aren't interested and know we are going to go home alone. If we at any point in the night mention having to wake up the next morning, that means something isn't right for one of us (or someone isn't right is a better way of putting it) and we are going home alone. Remember that this is 100% or 0%. 

I'm not entirely sure how we would have handled that situation any differently than you if we were 4 hours away, but I have a feeling my wife would have taken one look (and smell) and said something to the effect of ""yeah, I can't do this. I changed my mind. I have to go."" and then probably would have just left. lol. But she's way blunt like that and will 100% straight up leave a situation she isn't comfy in. It is kinda rude, but not as rude as not having proper hygiene. 

Just let Alex down gently. You don't have to get into specifics unless he asks (and he very well might ask). And at that point, just say that you two like a certain level of body maintenance, and she doesn't match your ideal level.

Lisa can't be oblivious to it. Nobody who chooses to do that is oblivious to it and living in Denver (which is really close to Boulder and hippies), I've found that pretty much everyone who doesn't bodyscape or brush teeth or take the extra precautions do it for a reason and are kinda uppity about it, so there really isn't a reason for you to feel bad for her, but I totally see where you're coming from for feeling bad for having to break the news to him.

Let me know how it goes, and if you ever come to Denver, you'll have a totally hygienic couple in us that would at a minimum have a few beers with you guys. :)

EDIT: Yes, getting ready and preparing is half the fun. I love my wife picking out matching bra and panties and see which one looks the best on her for whatever she's wearing, and then getting dolled up and totally body spraying herself and putting on lotion and such. It's like foreplay to the foreplay :)","1406852149"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Hamas is using civilian areas to attack from, and it's a shitty thing to be doing because it forces Israel to make a choice where they have two losing options: They can risk military manpower going in and ensuring that there are less civilian casualties by engaging in direct infantry combat, or they can not risk their soldiers and incur heavy civilian collateral damage on the other side.

In reality, this should be a non-choice. You accept that you are going to lose soldiers and you do what you can to minimize civilian collateral damage. This is the only real choice for two reasons: 1) It minimizes the support the enemy can gain from your actions, because people who have lost loved ones to fire from your forces are going to be significantly more willing to back those who oppose you, and 2) It shows that you are, in fact, trying to be the ""good guy"", which matters on the international stage.

Israel has opted not to do this, and in doing so has declared to the world that one living Israeli soldier is worth several dead Palestinian civilians. Israel isn't intentionally killing civilians -- they just don't give a fuck if civilians die so long as their target is taken care of.

""Roof knocking"" is quite literally dropping a shell on a place before dropping a lot more shells on a place a minute or two later. It's better than nothing, but that's about all you can say for it.  

What can they do about it? Utilize the troops they've trained for this shit to actually go in and take care of things at a smaller scale. Yes, it puts soldiers at much higher risk -- but that's part of being a soldier. Yes, more Israelis will die this way, but countless fewer Palestinian civilians will. Furthermore, it weeds out Hamas and other groups more effectively by providing less reason to rally against Israel.

Taken back to the previous analogy, it's basically waiting until I have a clear shot on you, then shooting JUST you or maybe the single person in line with you rather than mowing your whole family down to get at you.","1406852151"

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","The Contour SVT was based off of the Ford of Europe's Mondeo, which was fairly well respected in its time for what it was (small to midsize FWD sedan). 

The SVT had the most aggressive suspension of the Contour family, but that was really some fairly soft springs on aggressive shocks/struts. 

If you're somewhere that salts their roads, keep an eye out for rust. I'm not sure why, but every SVT I've come across has seemed to have some pretty bad rust under the rear wheel wells, despite only being 15 years old. 

You have the right idea with not modifying the engine--IMHO, 230HP is really the limit for front wheel drive power where the torque steer doesn't become distracting and cumbersome (there are, of course, exceptions to this). In terms of the suspension, you should look around--a short search didn't turn up much in terms of aftermarket (although I'm sure there's stuff out there), and even the H&amp;R Sport Spring set was listed as ""Non-SVT"".

"HPMOR","t5_2t5xf","Evidence for the no-lying-in-Parseltongue hypothesis:

&gt;*Will you keep my ssecret, boy? ""*

&gt;*""Yess,""* hissed Harry. *""Would never break promisse.""*

&gt;The snake seemed to hold still, as though in shock, and then began to sway again.

and the insistence on a verbal response (that Harry intends to keep Quirrell's secrets) from Chapter 49. 

The flipside, things we're pretty sure Quirrell is lying about, he never says in Parseltongue; Chapter 51:

&gt;""All right,"" Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had finished. ""If anyone is still watching us now, we are in any case doomed, so I will speak plainly and in human form. Parseltongue does not quite suit me, I fear, as I am neither a descendant of Salazar nor a true snake.""

shortly before feeding Harry the line about Bellatrix being innocent, which he never repeats in Parseltongue.

Probably the strongest single bit of evidence, though, is

&gt;*""Usse ssensse, boy! Ssupposse I am evil. To end usse of you here iss obvioussly not what I planned. Misssion iss target of opportunity, invented after ssaw your guardian Charm, whole affair meant to be unnoticed, hid when left eating-place.* ***Obvioussly you will ssee persson pretending to be healer on arrival!*** *Go back to eating-place afterward, original plan carriess on undissturbed! ""*

This seems to be a case where Quirrell would be better served by directly lying, if he could, but the conversation needed to happen in Parseltongue due to Bellatrix being nearby.

Edit: also, looking at the latest chapter, Quirrell goes snake to say some things he doesn't want overheard, and which we have no particular reason to think aren't true, but the things he turns back to human to say seem much more suspicious (that he intended Harry to be his heir, that his strength is waning, etc etc).","1406852154"

I wish the world was as simple as you think, where Israel could magically know the exact location of every Hamas member, every weapon cache, every murder tunnel.

**A gurkha who defeated 40+ train robbers, while only using a knife**

&gt;Despite the chaos around him, Naik Bishnu Shrestha just sat there quietly. Not saying anything. Not betraying his emotions. Even when the thugs took his own wallet, he remained silent. Like a true badass, he knew that this wasn't his fight. Just be quiet, give them what they want, and survive. It's just a few hundred bucks. It's not worth dying over.

&gt;But then shit got out of hand. You see, it just so happened that Shrestha was sitting near a cute 18 year-old girl, and when this gang of baby-kicking terrorists came by her seat they decided it would be awesome to be the complete fucking slime of the earth and gang-rape her in front of her own terrified parents just for shits and giggles. The terrorist leader cut open her shirt while she cried for help.

&gt;That was fucking it. Bishnu Shrestha couldn't just sit by any longer.

&gt;Unfortunately for the douchebags of West Bengal, when the thugs had robbed Bishnu they'd made one fatal mistake: They didn't take his kukri. This ultra-hardass Gurkha warrior, one in a long line of head-cleaving soldiers battle-hardened by centuries of hand-to-hand combat (and a steady diet of steel tacks and the corpses of their slain enemies), had given up his money, but knew better than to ever relinquish his weapon. Slowly, effortlessly, he eased the hilt from its hiding place. Now these fuckers were going to see what it felt like to get a taste of their own steel-tipped medicine, and it was going to taste like dental-grade pain and a roll of nasty old pennies.

&gt;Corporal Shrestha leapt to his feet, drawing the ultimate symbol of Gurkha badassitude with one fluid motion. He flew across the train car, grabbing the would-be rapist from behind in a sleeper hold, pulled him up off the girl, and used him as a human shield while he lunged out and slashed one of the sword-swinging thugs, sending the hapless dude spinning off in a vicious tornado of blood. One of the other motherfuckers, unwilling to stab in the direction of his own boss, instead took the manly man's route and tried to cut the girl, slashing his knife wildly at her neck, but the girl only took a minor wound before Shrestha dropped him with a lightning-quick strike. With the terrorists in the immediate vicinity disposed of, he sliced the throat of his human shield and went looking for more fuckers to get his blood-rage off on.

&gt;The news reports are pretty vague about what happened during this epic battle, where one balls-out Gurkha face-wrecker carved his way through a pack of 40 merciless cutthroats (indeed, even the above paragraph is a little bit of pulp fiction editorializing – merely my interpretation of the phrase ""he took control of the attacker and killed everyone around him"") but the fact of the matter is that after his initial ambush this ex-military mecha-hardass from one of the world's most over-the-top batshit-insane military organizations suddenly found himself in the middle of a hostage-filled train crawling with well-armed, highly-organized terrorists. This was Die Hard without the cowboy references. Delta Force without Lee Marvin. Under Siege without the Dramamine. and Passenger 57 without the always betting on black thing. And, worse yet, it was happening in real life.

&gt;Over the next twenty minutes, Corporal Bishnu Shrestha raced through the aisles giving those wanna-be punk-ass thugs a first-class ride on the Pain Train to Severed Arteryville, cutting, dodging, and back-alley knife fighting anything carrying a weapon larger than a ball-point pen. He took on the entire train – 40 men – at once, killing three and wounding eight more with a ferocious series of face-stabs and Limit Break Whirlwind Slashes so badass they would make Jet Li proud. Even after he took a nasty sword blow that severed every major artery and vein in his left hand, he continued carving up douchebags with his kukri, all the while spraying what I like to imagine to be a pseudo-comical amount of blood from his non-killing hand.

&gt;The sight of a real man was too much for those weak-willed thugs, and once they realized that they weren't just beating up schoolchildren and robbing crippled old ladies of their wedding rings and were instead facing a goddamned psychotic Gurkha with balls so gigantic they barely fit through the doorway of the train car, they dropped all their look and ran for it like fucking pussies. The whole thing was over in about 20 minutes. When the train pulled into the next station, police and emergency personnel were there to treat the wounded and rush Shrestha to the hospital, where he spent two months recovering from the injury to his hand. When the police searched the dead and dying thugs, they recovered 40 gold necklaces, 200 cell phones, 40 laptops, and nearly $10,000 in stolen cash. Those idiots lucky enough to be left alive were hauled in to jail.

&gt;Bishnu Shrestha was temporarily un-retired from the Gurkhas for the purposes of being promoted and subsequently awarded two medals for bravery and awesomeness. His former unit also awarded him with a presumably-rightously-looking silver-plated kukri (kind of like how when you beat Goldeneye you unlock the Silver PP7) and a cash bonus of 50,000 Rupees, which is enough to buy like 200 Blue Rings in The Legend of Zelda. The Indian Government also awarded him the bounty that was on the heads of this vicious gang, and granted him discounted airfare and train tickets for the rest of his life. I guess after hearing this guy's insane story they just decided to say, ""fuck those backscatter ultra-invasive x-ray machines, the best anti-terror homeland security measure our country can take is to make sure this guy is on as many flights and trains as possible.""

&gt;Ultimately, like a true badass, Bishnu Shrestha doesn't need any thanks for doing what he needed to do. The family of the girl he saved offered him a reward of $6,500, but the dude never stopped by to collect it. That wasn't the point. The man himself said it best, responding to reporters by saying, ""Fighting the enemy in battle is my duty as a soldier.  Taking on the thugs on the train was my duty as a human being.""

I honestly didn't expect the comment to blow up quite as much as it did. I really just expected to be downvoted to oblivion. But anyway, I just wanted to respond with a couple of things.

First is this:
&gt;The Obama administration in 2011 told colleges to adopt a “preponderance of the evidence” standard, a lower burden of proof than the “clear and convincing” standard that many institutions had been using.

So while you're correct, this is what I was referring to.

Second is that while I agree with many of the things that you posted, I still think that the college should not be allowed to have a second ""trial"" or ""disciplinary hearing"" over something that does not meet the evidentiary standards of a court of law since what they're accused of is, in fact, a crime.

But, those two things aside, I like the reforms that are introduced. The framework is already in place, so we should improve it if nothing else. I'm nothing if not a pragmatic soul.","1406852160"

I went through the box just now, and the Green left shift key is broken, so I've just send an email to massdrop to get that replaced. If that's a deal breaker, I can just drop the key in the mail to you whenever I get it.

Honestly the keyboard is brand new/never used. It was delivered yesterday around 4pm, and was out of the box for just a few minutes to make sure it worked. I'm kind of annoyed/upset that Massdrop never told us about the MX Clear version until after the previous drop ended. Had I known the Clear drop would start just a couple of days later, I wouldn't have bought this keyboard in the first place. Kind of shady business tactics really.

Lo importante no son la cantidad de Km2, sino cómo, quién, dónde y en base a qué interés o intereses se toman las decisiciones que afectan al uso, gestión y rendimiento de esos km, y de lo que es más importante, los servicios, obligaciones y derechos de las personas que en ellos habitan. Puedo asegurar que organizar una simple y pequeña comunidad de vecinos, de escasos 1000 m2 en horizontal, no la hace ni más ni menos ""hermosa"" que otra de 2000 m2 con el doble de vecinos, o con la mitad. La ""hermosura"" se mide en otras cosas como la educación, el respeto, o la convivencia armónica, por citar algunas, y eso no se consigue sólo cambiando los estatutos (léase constitución) o determinando de una manera más justa el pago de las cuotas comunitarias (léase esfuerzo fiscal, por ejemplo). Hay quien pretenderá irse a vivir al campo y pasar de sus vecinos, pero eso es caro..... diría que muy caro y sólo al alcance de quien pueda permitírselo. Es España sola, sin Europa y ya no puede.... pensar en una bonita independencia, a día de hoy, es soñar, o estar dispuesto a pasarlas francamente mal a la hora de pagar las facturas de todos los gastos corrientes, energia, seguridad, comunicaciones.....

Establecer y organizar la unión de los pueblos que la componen como un sólo país es el reto que tiene Europa por delante, con su denostada y olvidada Constitución Europea, y España también, pues el sistema autonómico (qué invento más salomónico, la famosa LOAPA) que surge en la transición está caducado, y es inviable económicamente, pues sólo servía para poder hacer la transición de la dictadura a la partitocracia. Ahora nos toca pasar a la democracia de una vez, sin miedos ni ataduras, con la resistencia de los políticos de la casta, herederos de los privilegios que en otro tiempo detentaban los militares que ejercían el poder en España.

And I'm not some small-government wacko. I think we should have clean, 24-hour public transportation everywhere, and I think school should be 100% free, along with health care and dental care. But I think the government should spend money on things that uplift people, and that people can share. What you're asking for falls well short of either one of those standards (as does, frankly, a lot of the shit that we spend government money on in the US). 

My advice is to observe people who are able to survive well, and mimic them. Where do they live? What do they do with their time? What is their thought process?

Personally my suggestion for the lanes would be; Lorries and Slower vehicles who are forced/want to go ~60mph should stay in the left lane. The middle lane should be used for going 70 and anyone that wants to overtake can use the right lane. That way people who follow the speed limit can stay at 70 as opposed to going 70 in the left lane and then having to keep moving over to pass lorries which are limited to 60, only to go back in the left lane and then come across another lorry and having to overtake.","1406852168"

Edit: It's disturbing as hell that you all seem to think the blame for these deaths lies at the feet of the Palestinians because Israel is ruthless enough to slaughter a building full of children to get at just one guy who was not even in a combat situation.  That's victim-blaming, plain and simple.  They would not have died if somewhere along the line someone in IDF command had not decided that these were acceptable losses.

"JapanTravel","t5_2uylr","I lived in Shimane for two years and I can say it's very picturesque! Shimane and Tottori next door are the two least populated prefectures in Japan, but it also means there's a lot of natural beauty. Tottori is famous for its sand dunes, but I don't know a ton about it, so I'm about to go tour guide on Shimane.

I lived near Matsue, Shimane, which has Matsue Castle that's still in its original construction and definitely worth a visit. The entrance to hell (Yomotsuhirasaka) according to the Kojiki is in Higashiizumo nearby. You can check out the silver mine Iwami Ginzan in Oda (third biggest producer of silver in the world before it was shut down, I think), and check out Kotogahama beach there...the sand squeaks when you walk on it because of the quartz! Also it's a very clean and not so busy beach, so we loved going there. Izumo Taisha is the most famous shrine in Shimane. Gotsu has an aquarium with beluga whales who blow out bubble rings. Tons of natural onsens in Yunotsu (near Oda) and Tamatsukuri (near Matsue). Tsuwano is a ""little Kyoto"" and is an adorable small town. There's a sword museum near Okuizumo that was super interesting to see, we got to talk to some swordsmiths and handle some blades. Also a huge forge that was the inspiration for Iron Town in Princess Mononoke. 
I can go oooon and oooon, but feel free to Google more about Shimane. I think it's definitely worth a road trip.

If Israel were to say ""Starting next month, we are going to disband all our military and stop fighting back or defending ourselves.  We will go the way of complete peace. WE support the right of our neighbours to exist""
If they did that, Israel would be wiped off the map and everyone there killed.  THeir neighbours don't just argue with them, they publicly state that their goal is to wipe Israel out of existence - that it is not a country and has no right to exist.

On the other hand, if Hamas and the other neighbours were to say ""Okay, we recognize your right to exist. We're not going to fight anymore either"" 
Then there would simply be no more fighting.

See how lopsided that is?

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I'm sorry, this actually reads to me as a GM who both wont admit to railroading and even reserves permission for him to not admit it because of game world gods and crap.

&gt; Player: Well... Do you give me your word that it's not a quantum ogre?

&gt; GM: Technically, I can't do that.

Actually you can give your word, because doing a quantum ogre is something a GM does, not a god, not a warlock - the latter use fictional magic powers, etc. Sure, one example is if the warlock has scrying (or a good telescope) and a teleport, he can spot where the PC is and teleport the ogre there - that's got some fictional story to it. Just forcing the ogre to exist for no other reason than the GM wanted one is metagamey. You can promise not to do the latter. Preferably the former can be explained to the players at some point (get to the warlocks chamber, see a telescope/crystal ball and a teleport circle)

The biggest question is whether that GM would put up with this if they were a player. Generally that's why certain GM's never play - they can't take their own medicine - because that medicine sucks.

I get the idea of having some faith in your GM. But if the GM can't show his accounting and insists you should never be able to look at his accounting, it generally means his accounting has something to hide.

I mean the above GM, does he admit there's a difference between that the ogre would just be there on that path Vs the ogre will be where ever you go?

If as GM you act like your game involves the former but really you do both or just the latter, then it's just old fashioned lying.

At best you're a confused GM who doesn't get there's a difference and so you careen between the two without control over it.","1406852175"

Anyway the topic of Necromancers, Have you ever read the Abhorsen trilogy/old kingdom series by Garth Nix? If not I highly recommend it, it a series I read through 3 times now. So in these stories are the Abhorsen, a order of mages that are more or less Necromancers. However instead of raising the Dead, it is their job to keep the dead dead and if need be put them back to sleep and guide them through the 9 gates of death.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The data also indicates *where* the money is coming from matters, particularly in local, state and congressional elections. The Koch brothers we all get up in arms about? They've been *trying* to get their candidates in government. They've also been failing at such a tremendous rate that they'd have a better chance at a coin toss. In fact, candidates taking their entire budgets from a handful of people (or financing themselves) is often the death-knell of a campaign.

It works like this: If one guy gives you a million dollars, you have one million dollars and one vote. If one million people give you one dollar, you have one million dollars and one million votes. People are *much* more likely to show up to the polls if they feel committed by a financial investment such as a campaign contribution. Obama 2008 won in a landslide in no small part due to this kind of campaign tactic. Did they have a lot of money? Yeah. They also had a lot of *people* behind that money. McCain also had a lot of money, and it didn't win him the election.

You get someone to give you a dollar, they're going to go out and vote for you. It's a strange sort of logic, but it's what dominates traditional campaign fundraising. When people donate to you, they feel *obligated* to you. They don't want to have given you their money and got nothing in return, so they show up on election day. They guy who got his million from the millionaire only gets the one vote.

&gt;[As of June 2013, it had been ratified by 174 states,\[1\] with the United States, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Turkey being notable exceptions.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_I)

This is, for example, the provision that forbids ""indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations, and destruction of food, water, and other materials needed for survival. Indiscriminate attacks include directly attacking civilian (non-military) targets, but also using technology such as biological weapons, nuclear weapons and land mines, whose scope of destruction cannot be limited."" 

Mind you, this only applies to international conflicts, which is of course slippery in Israel's case since neither Gaza nor the West Bank are really nations.

Protocol II:

&gt;[As of April 2013, the Protocol had been ratified by 167 countries, with the United States, Turkey, Israel, Iran, Pakistan, and Iraq being notable exceptions. However, the United States, Iran, and Pakistan signed it on 12 December 1977 with the intention of ratifying it.\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_II) 

This one applies to *internal* conflicts, so that provision above applies either way. Except of course Israel (like the US) didn't ratify either.

You'll be relieved to know they *did* ratify Protocol III, which allows medical personnel to display the Red Crystal in addition to the Red Cross and Red Crescent.","1406852176"

My husband needs to look for work outside the union. He's been afraid to do that - I touched upon that earlier. Homelessness needs to not be an option - unless we happen upon friends who have space and tolerate children well until we get on our feet. Without counting on that scenario it is clear we need to avoid losing the roof over our heads.

The thing I'm finding interesting about homosexuality is that the Bible mainly regards it not as a sin but a judgment.  I don't know all the implications of that, but two are clear:


If someone goes to hell, it isn't because they kissed a guy and were a guy themselves or whatever.  *Everyone* has bigger topics at work.  God describes his ministry to everyone as ""reconciliation.""  Colossians even goes so far as to call the previously unsaved ""enemies in [our] minds;"" that is, God never regarded them as enemies but only estranged friends with whom he wanted to reconcile.


and, that Jesus only ever described himself qualitatively once.  (He used several metaphors, but only once used adjectives.)  That was in Matthew 11, that he was ""gentle and humble in heart.""","1406852186"

Yes, the old man is actually the rude player at the table (semi slow rolling) and the younger guy wouldn't have raised a single eyebrow at a poker table with his matter-of-fact statement. It was a simple play for both of them and if you dealt that hand to 300 different pros 300 different times it would play out just about the same way every time (minus the slow roll).

They might not go all-in on the flop but by the river someone will be all in.. nobody is folding a boat without some serious warning lights. Its just a cooler. They're unavoidable. 

Anyway, this gets posted every time by anyone with poker experience, maybe Reddit will pick up on it one day. Well, no, but at least a few members of the community read and learn! So its a net benefit.

&gt;He murdered, he assassinated, he lied, he played loose and fast with his own dogma and made shit up as he went along revising it as he needed. And once he was in a position of power, he then recanted the only good parts of the religion he'd stolen from.

lol, how dare he go to war in defense of his people when they were being oppressed and murdered! What a murderer!

A thing I noticed is that before, I didn't really feel like a person. I just felt like a disembodied consciousness watching all of this insanity around me unfold.

Odin is also Cowl, Kumori is Elaine and Elaine was originally lined up as starborn to lead against the Outsiders as she was more predictable, but Harry kept getting in the way (killing DuMorne, destroying the DarkHallow etc) and now he is in pole position and Odin is grooming him instead.

Odin as Cowl (or Grimnr) was at that party of Bianca's.

Harry's daughter with Lash will name herself Mary Sue.

Elaine was pregnant by Harry when she took refuge with Titania, and traded the child to her for her safety as it was all she had to bargain with. 

Murphy will take up Odin's job offer at some pint in the future to save her life, or Harry's life or both, but it will change her relationship with Harry as he 'should' have died.

Thomas and Ebeneezer will end up duelling each other unaware they are family, putting Harry in the middle revealing to all his familial relationships.

Harry will end up with Kringle's Mantle (Ho, Ho, Ho), displacing that of the Winter Knight and gaining Kringle's knowledge and power over time. This explains Harry's love of Coca Cola, it's foreshadowing.

Mac is Heimdallr, watching out for Ragnarok and drinking beer.

QuickTime AMA Live Link

Lots of QuickTime files linked via AMA could cause delays in very large projects, because they had AMA Live Link enabled by default. This AMA Live Link feature would constantly check if there were any newer version of your Quicktime file available on the system. Now, the user can improve the performance of AMA linked Quicktime files by disabling Quicktime AMA Live Link, under the AMA Settings.

---

I had this happen so many times… I often avoid AMA on larger projects. I hope that this new feature significantly speeds up AMA.  ","1406852197"

Because you are continually missing the point. You can appreciate the film for its purpose without enjoying the content that is meant unease, and appreciate the fact that it disgusts you. You yourself say (your interpretation)

&gt;This film was obviously made to be propaganda against the violence in American films

If so, then is it not effective? Is it not well executed in what it tries to achieve? It's well made, well acted, and uses violence to convey a message. In this regard, it is a good film, but you seem to think this makes it a bad film, as if it is one of the same films you yourself say Funny Games is made directly against. 

It seems to boil down to what you define as a good film. If I understand correctly, you define it as generally enjoyable. You seem to think I enjoy Funny Games in the same way people enjoy the very same films it is parodying/mocking/subverting, hence your initial reply. 

I define a good film as high quality and expert execution. Whether I enjoy it or not doesn't necessarily impact my perception of quality, but rather if the film is well crated enough to get its message across, or at least impart the audience with something important. That is why I think Funny Games is a good film. I'm done discussing why I think that, because that's as clear as I can make it.","1406852198"

Then again she is an actress and a celebrity to some extent they are all putting on act. We all put on personas when dealing with other people. Celebrities and actors just do it better and more easily than the rest of us. This may really be her at this point, at least as much as you are you in front of say your boss.

The ones that work for both sides are sort of a large hit for the player utilizing it, and although should be an investment for future turns, are in a way a hit in tempo that have more of a downside than not. 

They can potentially be amazing though, but I'm not completely sold on the idea that building a deck around these scrolls currently is going to gain a much larger tempo gain than an opponent just reacting to playing their own scrolls. I might be wrong though, and someone will find a deck that makes lingering effects OP, but atm it seems like more of a gimmick than something viable. ","1406852199"

&gt;**Introducing Bot and Spider Filtering**
&gt;
&gt;Many of you have shared with us that it’s hard to identify the real traffic that comes to your pages. That’s why I’m pleased to announce that we’re adding bot and spider filtering. 
&gt;
&gt;You can simply select a new checkbox option which would be included in the view level of the management user interface. This option would be labeled ""Exclude traffic from known bots and spiders"". Selecting this option will exclude all hits that come from bots and spiders on the IAB know bots and spiders list. The backend will exclude hits matching the User Agents named in the list as though they were subject to a profile filter. This will allow you to identify the real number of visitors that are coming to your site. 
&gt;
&gt;Nestlé has been testing it and has found great benefit:  
&gt;
&gt;“The Bot filter solution is essential for getting deeper insights. View level availability let us stay fully aligned with Best Practices provided to all site owners. Very easy to use, understand and communicate across thousands of Google Analytics users.”
&gt;
&gt;-  Katarzyna Malik, Nestlé Google Analytics Specialist
&gt;
&gt;Happy Analyzing!

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","I feel like I run into a disproportionately high number of women who insist up, down, and sideways that they are completely unattracted to men, except for the *one man* they decided to spend the rest of their lives with. I rarely, if ever, see formerly happy gay men making similar claims, or straight women or men, either. And that strikes me as curious, especially given how smoothly the ""100% lesbian minus my husband"" story plays into the ""One Penis Rule"" fantasy.  It just seems so culturally neat for the man, that his wife would never ever be with a man, except for wonderful old him, because we are soul mates. And I admit, I'm also suspicious of it because the women I know who've called themselves ""lesbian with one exception"" (their dear husband) always turned out to be powerfully capable of attraction to other men, or admitted to me they desperately jumped on the first man they thought they felt a twinge of desire for because *phew* now they don't have to come out as full lesbian. I don't know. The whole thing is probably unfair on my part, but it makes me wonder how many of these women are unconsciously tailoring their stories to play into certain narratives about how True Love should work for women (it should overcome all obstacles, it should be about being powerfully in love with a person and not about shallow concerns like physical attraction, and yeah, ultimately, it should be hetero.) 

I don't know. I'm probably being suspicious and unfair. Maybe I just really can't understand, because my story is both similar to this woman's and, at the same time, nothing at all like it. I also thought I was a lesbian for most of my youth, and was exclusively attracted to women. Then, I got older, I changed in my desires and in how I related to different genders, and I suddenly found myself attracted to men. Men. Plural. See, there was no Exception in Shining Armour who swept me up and away into a hetero fairy tale ending. It was just me. Changing. Changing that involved suddenly wanting to fuck a lot of men into the mattress. Which was scary and weird and, as I found, threatening to a lot of people, men as well as women.

 I don't know. Maybe I'm just projecting my bitterness onto other people, and I apologize if you are, sincerely, someone who's only interested in one member of a sex. But I can't help feeling like the author of this piece is trying to cater to a male fantasy while also pretending to be bravely pushing the bounds of sexual identity.","1406852207"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Its the 21st century, you don't wave your dick and see whose is bigger.

Doesn't matter what century it is, if you have your opponent at your mercy then you show mercy. Here's an extract from The Joint Service Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict (available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/27874/JSP3832004Edition.pdf (Page 60 of the pdf)).

&gt;Evidence of practices intended to alleviate the sufferings of war can be found in the writings of the ancient civilizations of India and Egypt. Agreements on the treatment of prisoners of war existed in Egypt around 1400 BC. The edicts of the Indian Emperor Asoka of about 250 BC were based on principles of humanity. In Europe, the idea of imposing rules on the conduct of warfare seems to have emerged in the Middle Ages as a result of the combined influences of Christianity and chivalry. It is said, however, that the first systematic code of war was that of the Saracens, based on the Koran, and principles of the law of armed conflict presented themselves in many different parts of the world.

It's a mark of human civilisation to have empathy for your enemy. As soon as we learned writing, we started jotting down rules on how be humane with your military. Writing them down, presumably because some powerful idiot made everyone stop one day and go ""We're going to have to write this down. You'd think you wouldn't have to, but clearly some people need to be reminded that the powerful have a duty to be merciful to the weak.","1406852207"

we agree women carry the fetus, correct. 

&gt;I'm done, because you obviously can't seem to get that, **along [sic]** with how history plays a part here.

I do get that women carry the fetus. We agree. For some reason you seem to feel that the 9ish months of gestation equate to women having a larger say in the next minimum 18 years. I say the man and the woman should have equal say in their own lives over this time. 

You list preventative methods as mens contraceptives (the barrier methods really is the only male BC, as pills, spermicides, and hormanal are mostly for women.) and say this gives men choice and freedom. I say this gives them a chance at choice, but none of them are effective post fertilization. Women have the day after, abortion, adoption, safe-haven laws. Im saying men deserve an equal footing in this. Why are you so against that? 

Why should one side get an unfair advantage in this situation, because right now women are the only ones that have input on that decision but both people pay for what ever decision she makes and by definition that is inequality.

Gah! The level of ego on these bitches. And these guys that are constantly falling for these imaginary phenomena these bitches keep coming up with. PATRIARCHY! MANSPLAINING! GENDER NEUTRAL ORC WITH 60 MANA or some shit.

"weightroom","t5_2ssmu","""The first Olympic Games of 1896 included weightlifting in the Field event of the predecessor to today's Track and Field or Athletics event. During the 1900 Olympic Games, there was no weightlifting event. Weightlifting resumed as an event, again in Athletics, in 1904 but was omitted from the Games of 1908 and 1912. These were the last Games until after the First World War. In these early Games, a distinction was drawn between lifting with 'one hand' only and lifting with 'two hands'. The winner of the 'one hand' competition in 1896 was Launceston Elliot, while the winner of the 'two hands' event was Viggo Jensen of Denmark.

In 1920, weightlifting returned to the Olympics and, for the first time, as an event in its own right. At these Games, which took place in Antwerp, Belgium, fourteen nations competed. The competition lifts were the 'one hand' snatch, the 'one hand' clean and jerk and the 'two hands' clean and jerk. At the next Olympic Games, in Paris, France, in 1924, the 'two hands' press and the 'two hands' snatch were added to the programme, making a total of five lifts.

In the Olympic Games after 1920, instead of requiring all competitors to compete against each other regardless of size, weight classes were introduced and, by the 1932 Olympic Games, weightlifting was divided into five weight divisions.

In 1928, the sport dropped the 'one hand' exercises altogether leaving only the three remaining exercises: the clean and press, the snatch and the clean and jerk. By 1972, the clean and press was discontinued because athletes started to push with legs and bend backwards instead of strictly pressing the weight overhead, and this left the sole elements of what is today's modern Olympic weightlifting programme – the snatch and the clean and jerk. The snatch entails pulling with a very wide grip the barbell overhead without pressing out with the arms. It is a very precise lift that can be nullified by a lack of balance of the athlete. The clean and jerk is more forgiving using a narrower grip pull the bar to the shoulders and then using the strength of the legs push until arms reach full extension without a press out.""

**BB Updates - 07/31/14 03:33 PM by AdamAndEvel The full text of Caleb's Banana Speech, for the historical record: 3:10 PM BBT Cams 1/2**

Caleb: ""The outside looks bad."" 

Amber: ""Get me a glove."" 

Caleb: ""It's beat up, it's got a few bruises.""

Amber: ""It's the worst."" 

Caleb: ""A little rough around the edges, but on the inside this banana is pure. It's white. It may have a different texture than you're used to.
But you have to see a banana like a human. K? It's beat up, it looks disgusting on the outside, but you'll never know what it looks like until you get to the inside.

But to get to the inside, you have to give the banana a chance. You have to open the banana. You have to peel it to see what's on the inside, and we all are different.

Donny has a different texture than me. I have a different texture than Derrick. And at the end of the day, you never know - this might be the best banana you've ever eaten. That's how you look at a banana.""

Amber: ""That was the worst banana speech I've ever heard in my entire life."" 

Caleb: ""I mean it's got some tattoos, you know?"" 

Amber: ""It's an old man."" 

Caleb: ""Huh?"" 

Amber: ""It's an old man."" 

Caleb: ""But if you open this banana up, it's beautiful on the inside."" 

Amber: ""Caleb, stop talking."" 

Caleb: ""There's no bruises on the inside. There's nothing on it. It's white. And it's a regular banana. Just sayin'. You have to look at them like humans sometimes."" 

Amber: ""Ugh.""

I won't coddle you and say women don't care about size. They do. The kindest answer they ever give is ""too big or too small, it won't work lol""

*However*- you've got to keep in mind that there are plenty of women in relationships with dudes who just *naturally* have a small cock. These guys make it work for them, and you could do the same. Learn to eat box like a pro, do kegels and get good control, be attentive to the needs of each particular woman- and you can be a solid lover even if you choose to lose those inches.


So, if penetration is *literally* impossible...my personal choice would be to go for the surgery, if you can. Otherwise you're going to just be stuck with your dick in your hand....or hers, if you're lucky.

The moral of this statement is that a person who hides things in his own house does so because he is obsessed with theft. And why would he be obsessed with theft? Because he is a thief himself, and thus has a worldview based on his own experience.

They go about it in an awful way, but that does not absolve Israel of the crime of oppression. And yes there are more Arabs states. That's probably because unlike the people of Israel, the Arab states have populations that are native to the land, not transplanted from Europe and North America (I debated if I was going to respond to that point because it is completely irrelevant). Go on google maps and compare Gaza is Israel and tell me who the bully is.  Look at all that land farm land Israel has near the border and realize that those farms used to be how the people of Gaza feed themselves.  Justify the settlements. Justify the famous land grab map ( http://www.kadaitcha.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/palestineshrinks.jpg).

It doesn't even ""tick off"" if it's a fixed-term tenancy of one year, six months, etc. Just....nothing.

* Pictures: Everything is documented. That is to say, all the damage before AND their shitty attempts at fixing it. Which took less than...well less than 6 hours actually. They were supposed to have drywallers there at 9am (We took our cats away at 8 am) and when I came at 3:30pm ish to deliver notice of ending tenancy, my apartment was empty

**high-lights** :

* They...literally put a board on top of the hole they made connecting our bathroom to our bedroom via the closet. They...just nailed a board on top of it. I can see a hole that goes past their stupid board.

* The mold is still under the vanity cabinet...how is that even fucking possible at this point. What ""mold removal"" is this?

* Still no bedroom door

* Still no face-plates on electrical sockets

* Still birdshit on the balcony. Absolutely no pressure washing done.

http://i.imgur.com/mwDV6Wc.jpg

But seriously, this is all fresh. It is very normal to feel angry and betrayed at this stage. While there is no excuse for the bullshit oozing out from the 15 the local people did not lie to you knowingly.

&gt;  I just can't believe I was so stupid to fall into the church's trap for so long

Having been ""so stupid"" for most of my life I can say with reasonable confidence that you were not stupid. At least not for having been duped by the church. It's not the smart ones that find their way out, it's the lucky ones. Some of the smartest people I know are still Mormon.

Today you are looking at the church without the filters that somehow make it all make sense. You're seeing it for the absurdity that it is. It's natural to feel really foolish. But you were indoctrinated in it from the time you were at an age where anything you were told as a child would be taken for granted as being true. And why wouldn't they be true? to a small child, grown-ups seem to really have their shit together.

&gt;  I know I'm only going to get angrier once I come out of the closet and my church friends start dropping like flies and my family starts treating me horribly.

That happens unfortunately. And yes, the church is really damaging to families and friendships. What I've found is that while the transition is difficult, you find out quickly who your real friends are, and you will go on to form much stronger and  more sincere friendships than the church would ever allow.","1406852221"

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt;""Every woman in Holland can do whatever she wants with her life."" 

The point of that article was to demonstrate that women often chose lower paying jobs in order to do house duties and they rank the happiest. Am I inclined to believe that if you told them (by cultural means, not legal, mind you) that they should get married, it would decrease unhappiness.

&gt;Except the fact remains that these women were particularly strong and independent, but the majority of women weren't even given the opportunity to think that they had other options. 

How can you tell that majority of women weren't given the opportunity to think they had other options? Propaganda machine which flew both ways? How can you tell that most of them simply went with what they wanted, and it was house duties.

&gt;Where were the posters and ads inciting women to work, study, be independent? 

Why would there be such posters? If men and women are truly equal in intelligence capabilities, then a woman can do everything a man can do. Then a man can do everything a woman can do. But men cannot raise children, and it makes sense for a country in need of *social repair* cause you know, world wars and that, to boost their fertility. Female education has dysgenic effect, whether you like it or not. It makes no sense for a civilization to support it. It makes sense to enable it though, but not to propagand for it.

&gt;Because what man doesn't want a cleaning lady at home whom he doesn't have to pay a salary?

I seriously think that it isn't because of that. But because of the causes I mentioned before. And no, must men wouldn't mind if women did extra work bringing money to the table. The life of a housewife was not as nearly as repressive as the one of a house man. 

&gt;Yeah, he pays for her food and her things, but he effectively exerts control on her that way. 

And she can easily go away. I showed you divorce laws before feminism, and divorce laws post feminism are even more draconian if you are a man. Why do you think we have a term ""divorce rape""? 

&gt;Not only were women pushed to being housewives

They were not pushed by legal means. Which means that they weren't actually pushed, just encouraged to be housewives. And coupled with the fact that a high degree of women would rather enjoy this social role, ""pushed"" is even an overstatement. 

&gt;but then their work was not even recognized when they did. Which led many women to depression.

Yes and? Being a housewife isn't exactly taxing. And the post you link to mentiones 2000 study. If you can say that being a housewife in Dutch today is different than in the 50s, then I can say the same.

&gt;Wives were responsible for everything in a marriage. So if her husband decided to drink himself stupid one night it was automatically her fault. Yes, you'll say, they were probably having marital problems, so she was maybe the source of his distress. But she's at fault for a destructive habit and not him? There's more in that link.

The link showes only marriage advice, and not any legal methods. And yes, the legal system was still curved to favour women then. And one marriage advice from 50s does not mean that wives wre responsible for everything in a marriage. 

&gt;We were discussing what women needed back then. You were saying that women preferred to be housewives.

I'm pretty sure it started out as ""there was no cries for equality during world wars"". Then you developed it into ""being a housewife is taxing"" which is not something I would want. No, I'm not as focused on women as you are. Women needed rights (actually, from the link, you can see that they actually didn't), but what they needed is not necessarily the others needed. You prioritized right to vote (it was 20s when the right for vote was achieved, IRC, and WWII started in '39), but feminist didn't even try to do the right to fight despite it working in other countries. And when confronted by that, it was a simple ""people were more sexist back then"". That didn't stop them from trying to get the right to vote.

&gt;I said they didn't have a choice and many of them wouldn't have chosen that if they had been given an actual choice.

How can you be so sure.

&gt;Sure, who wants to take part in the decisions made by their own government and thus be officially considered as a citizen. Nope, that's for losers amiright

Certainly. If you really believe that you take part in the decisions your government makes then I'm afraid we don't have much to discuss.

&gt;If you weren't educated, you wouldn't be able to argue with me right now. You would have no idea how the world works, you would have no opinions of your own, and you would be extremely gullible. You wouldn't even have the skills to communicate the opinions you did have, and you could be easily manipulated by the simplest idiot.

You are overreliant on the notion of state sponsored education. Many of great men were autodidacts. And IRC, **primary** education was given to women.

&gt; So some women, when they're given an opportunity to be provided for, like the idea, and that's outrageous to you? 

No, it's not. How did you get that idea is beyond me. Being a housewife is essentially this, and you make a statement that most women wouldn't preffer this, but now you say that some women did. How does that worked.

&gt;What, they weren't allowed to enjoy anything at all?

Men are dying. Women are playing baseball. Women want equality because they are oppressed.

&gt; Especially once they were free, for the first time, to explore new occupations and ways of life?

Free? Propaganda for a woman to work in 40s was much higher than propaganda for a woman to be a housewife in 50s. You make claim that cultural pressures can ""push"" women, but now you say that propaganda aimed to get women working is ""freeing"" them.

&gt;You're framing your argument as if feminists were the only ones responsible for sending men to war. I told you it was the society as a whole. So you're just choosing the fraction of truth you like best and keep throwing it at me as if it proves anything. Men shamed men into going to war, too. Sorry.

No I'm not. Feminists were the ones pro equality. Society (men included) wasn't. Yet they both shamed men into going into war when feminist explicity wanted equal rights and equal duties. Societies were very much keen on keeping the status quo. And no, men did it do is not a credible argument, especially when feminists, paragons of equality, are supposed to be held in a higher regards than the oppressive society of the past. Sorry but claiming equality and then not only shirking from equal burdens, but shaming the other side is plain hypocritical.

&gt;Everyone assumes you're going to become a mechanic. Everyone pressures you to become a mechanic. Were you to decide to be a medic instead, no one would support you. No one would encourage you. **No one would actually give a shit.** But the option's there, so it's your fault, right?  

So you're saying that if I want to do X instead of Y, there won't be people clapping for it? Of course not. Other people not giving a shit about my choices is the best thing ever.

&gt; But it's about Anglo-Saxon women in the 17th century. What part of that article made you think that this applied to American women in the 20th century as well?

America is (was) Anglo-Saxon country with a lot of British ideas culturally diffused from them. For example, the Child Custody acts which established maternal default position. 

And you made the accusation that without feminism, women belonged to someone. That's false. That's the point.

&gt;I can link you to a source describing the social dynamics of a matriarcal society in New Guinea and it still would prove absolutely nothing about what we're discussing

Is New Guinea the biggest empire in the history which colonized half the world and produced a good amount of cultural and scientific advancements. Is New Guinea the one who sent their people to North America, and was New Guinea the colonial overloard of USA? Is the language of USA the one that matriarchal society speaks?

&gt;He belongs to her in that particular country at that particular time.

In most of the Western countries actually. And during the last 100 of years. When feminism was the highest.

&gt;**You forget that American women wanted to win the war. And they did they share. The fact that feminists didn't fight to have the right to die for their country doesn't mean anything.**

I'm going to let that speak for itself.

&gt;You're just giving me a childish argument here: ""men did all the soldier work and died, why didn't women die too!"" when we know that women weren't allowed in the army, weren't allowed to work 

It's not childish. Women were not allowed to vote, yet feminist fought that legal impediment and cultural expectations. But not a peep when you had to get your hands real dirty.

&gt;they didn't even have the same basic rights than men to begin with.

Yes they did.

&gt;You gave me one source about women living 3 centuries earlier and in a different country.

I gave you laws that were before feminism, in a country that spawned USA and had tremendous influence over the course of the world. You said that women before feminism ""belonged"" to someone, had no ""financial standings"", didn't have basic rights. This proves otherwise.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","First, would you mind replacing P, B, M, and S with fake names so that it's a little easier to understand? Maybe Paula, Benjamin, Maria, and Sergio or something?

Second, you're playing a pretty precarious balancing act here. You say B is your best friend, but he sounds as if he is starting to resent you, and if you keep hugging M or getting naked around each other then I doubt you will be friends for long. You say you have ""tried talking to him"". What did you actually say to him? Did you try to justify your actions and downplay your interactions with his wife? Because I doubt that is going to cut it. And the relationship he has with your wife isn't really relevant. It might not seem ""fair"", but he's jealous of your relationship with his wife, and you're not jealous of his relationship with yours. In fact, that might even be making things worse: his sexual attraction to your wife might make him think you are feeling the same sort of sexual attraction to his wife. So you probably need to give up on trying to explain ""no, no, it's not really like that"". (And frankly, if you're genuinely interested in watching her have sex or seeing her naked, then my spidey senses are tingling a little, too. Your friend may be assigning more sexual or romantic value to this than there is, but it doesn't sound **quite** as 100% strictly platonic as you say.)

I see this going two possible ways.

First, you could divest yourself of M in order to restore your relationship with B. Try to clear the air with B by apologizing for making him feel as if you are closer to his wife than you are, and asking what steps you can take to make sure you aren't doing anything to offend him. Then do what he asks. Try to stay away from her, don't get naked around her, don't look at her when she's naked, don't do drugs with her, don't make comments about watching her have sex, etc. No guarantees this will work, but maybe he will appreciate your genuine effort. I suspect he will always look at you suspiciously from now on no matter what you do, but at least this would probably stave off a total meltdown of your friendship and his marriage for now.

Second, you could just keep doing things the way you are doing, and hope that you maintain a balancing act to keep both B and M as close friends. B will probably become increasingly paranoid, but maybe your friendship is strong enough that he doesn't want to blow things up. On the other hand, if B has to choose between you and M, and M has to choose between you and B, they will almost definitely choose each other. So in a potential situation where B believes that you and his wife are too close and he needs to cut off contact, you probably lose your friendship with both of them.

Maybe there is some other way to talk B down from this, but at the end of the day, he thinks you and his wife are into each other. At that point, your friendship is probably never going to be the same because he has lost an enormous amount of trust in both you and his own wife in this situation.

Good luck.","1406852223"
