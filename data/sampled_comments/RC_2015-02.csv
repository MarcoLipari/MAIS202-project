"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","This is what bothers me about my sister. She is certainly no narc, but she has no idea how to express her emotions and tends to blow up over stupid things.

Just today, her boyfriend threw away a drink she wasn't done with. A normal person would be upset, and quickly get over it. She was pissed for a good 20 minutes, even after we both offered her money/drinks, just because she wanted *that* drink. She would have continued being upset but I very sternly reminded her that she was ruining her own mood over a hot, flat soda. She's 17 years old. She also blamed her boyfriend for us going 30 miles in the wrong direction... Even though he had been telling her to turn around the entire time.

It's really encouraging to see that there's hope she might learn to harness her emotions healthily. I have no idea how to go about pointing out that she does this because she will take it as a personal attack and just deflect back to me with rage. My current plan is calmly taking each situation as it arises and feeling out whether it would be a good time to tell her she's overreacting.","1422748800"

You may need to ask them for more details as to their exact use, how many copies (if in print), what size (if on the web) etc etc.   Tricky the first time out for sure, but well worth it if you can turn it into a sale.  If they've told you they want it for free and it will be good exposure for you (it won't) you can still give them a quote - sometimes they'll negotiate or accept your offer.

Rather than trying to shore up one of their weaknesses, I feel like they should play around their strengths more. Simply I believe that they should put more focus onto their jungler and adc, and have Hai simply play more passive. Hai's lack of world class mechanical skill comes back to bite them in the butt when he tries to make extremely aggressive plays. In most sports its been shown that at a certain point gathering of large amounts of talent will not always work if they lack the chemistry. C9 Have pretty good mechanical skill with sneaky, meteos, and Balls, and a support that does his job very well in lemonnation. I feel like if Hai can transition into simply doing his job like lemonnation does in support, and stop giving up random solo deaths due to stupid play (which happened alot at worlds and I felt like contributed more to their loss), they can contest. To be fair this is simply my opinion and I do realize that by replacing hai by a significant upgrade could work, it could also result in a large downgrade in one of their currrent strengths and only improve their weaknes by a little.","1422748804"

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","&gt; Then you have a hilariously broad definition of totalitarianism. The government isn't ""saying who is allowed to have how many children,"" the government is creating a tax incentive for people to not have as many children. The difference is pretty vast.

But it is saying that.

&gt; Procreation caps. We have a bad system now. Tax incentives for more children-- ""create more consumers!"" Gross. Population's real simple. Replace yourself before you die. That's it. You and a partner can have 2 kids. Hell, have 3 just in case. After that, your case needs to be reviewed. Is 4 kids financially viable for you? Or is it an irresponsible decision that puts a burden on society? At some point, we have to be fining people for having children, not giving them rewards.

This doesn't actually say that there will be tax incentives for people not to have as many children. It says that you 'can' have so many kids and after that your case needs to be reviewed; you will be penalised if the review is negative.

&gt; It is a pretty important choice, which is why precisely no one is arguing that the decision should be made for anyone by the government.

He's actually arguing exactly that, if you read the post.

&gt; TYL that providing sexual education for young women and protecting female reproductive rights do not directly affect men.

Forgot this bit?

&gt;  and influencing the country's birth rates

That would seem to include men. Certainly, from what the post actually proposes, men are included.

Edit: For extra clarity, most children (probably) are planned and men are usually involved in the planning. Any attempt to influence a country's birth rates would simply have to involve men, because most children's births were done with the agreement of the father. It'd be nonsense to try to appeal to married or de facto married women to control the birthrate separately from their husbands; it's a joined decision to have kids in most cases.

So if you care to argue what /u/Zizekesha actually proposed instead of building a strawman of his arguments that make them seem non-coercional, I'm right here and we can do that.","1422748806"

"finance","t5_2qhfj","&gt;  nationalism is the only barrier that exists here and that barrier has been eroding relatively quickly. 

The single Eurozone is unsustainable and doomed due to different economies and lower productivity of South-European countries, they can't directly compete with North-European countries while keeping the expensive euro. 

The big welfare governments are going bankrupt too: they don't balance their budgets, reduce national debts or decrease regulation to improve economic growth.

Europe is very diverse economically and culturally. It cannot be forced when the people don't want it and have the majority have voted against it several times. 

Integration is a natural process when people desire it and doesn't require a outdated centralized bureaucracy which has billions of euros unaccounted for.

EDIT:  Well, since it looks like this is going to stay at the top, it should probably serve a more useful purpose than just to be snarky.

* None of the occupants knew anyone was a suspect until police kicked in the door.

* There were daytime opportunities to grab the suspect that didn't involve a raid.

* They brought a TV crew and waited for a nighttime raid because raids = exciting television.  

* The officer tried to escape responsibility of his negligence by framing up the grandmother.

* The officer made claims that ran counter to testimony provided by other police on the scene.

* The suspect they wanted wasn't even in the house at the time.

EDIT2:  Blue-linked the top-bullet points clarify that the 'flashbang in the crib' was from a *different SWAT raid*.  Some readers seemed to think it was from the same incident;  These are separate tragedies.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","We are at the Twin Selection Ceremony. Here is where the council decides which of the two, when they have come of age, is more suited to live in Aragasia. Each year, on the first day of the year, thousands of twins gather to be given their fate; life or death.

Unfortunately for me, I already know my fate.

Tim put his hand on my shoulder, consoling me. ""Cheer up, Jim. You'll be going to a better place, I'm sure of it! Just remember the good times!"" I smiled weakly at my brother. Perfect Tim. He always had the better grades and the better social skills. Heck, I can't think of anything I can do better than my twin brother. I love him, I really do, but it's hard not to resent someone who basically signed your death warrant.

""You're right, Tim. I had a good life. Thanks for being an amazing brother."" I feel a tinge of guilt at the praise. The truth is, he *is* an amazing brother. But that just makes me even more angry sometimes. It bothers me that I never had a chance at life when he was clearly the superior sibling. In reality, being with Tim made me feel like little more than a shadow.

""Jim and Tim Stevenson"" Called the announcer. We stepped up to the podium together, shoulder to shoulder. The fact that I'm about to die doesn't bother me, not really. I'm scared about losing my brother. We did everything together, every since we were born. Even though I never felt like I accomplished much while he was shining so brightly, he never made me feel like that. We were best buddies. I don't want to lose him.

""Tim and Jim are both extraordinary citizens, as most of you know."" Continued the head of the council, an elderly gentlemen with a cane that he didn't really need. ""In fact, together they logged around 400 hours of community service last year alone!"" This comment was followed by a deafening roar created by the millions of live viewers. Parents, family, friends, all coming to see which one of us would die.

Of course, the applause *would* make me feel good, if it wasn't originally Tim's idea to do the community service.

""Yes, they are indeed model citizens. Unfortunately, as the law says, only one of them may leave here today. So without further ado...""

Silence. Well, at least I think it's silence. I couldn't hear anything over the sound of my heartbeat anyway. The councilman gently reached into an envelope, carefully pulling out a small slip of paper. He began to unfurl it. He looked at it the pulled the microphone to his lips.

""Tim Stevenson has been chosen to continue in this world. Please give a round of applause to his other half, Jim Stevenson, may he rest in peace!""

The audience began to shout and cheer, but I didn't hear anything. Of course they chose to kill me, I expected this. Tim is the better twin, he deserves to live. It's better this way. I keep telling myself that, but it doesn't seem to help.

""Jim, please step forward now."" In front of the councilman was a platform that descended to the kill room. They say it's painless. I hope so. I take a deep breath as I prepare to end my own life.

Unfortunately for me, that breath is long forgotten somewhere in my chest. Tim has stepped forward, onto the platform. 

""Goodbye, Jim"" Said the councilman. Tim looked at me as the platform began to descend into the floor. He smiled and gave me a thumbs-up. I stared back at him, tears running down my face with a look of utter disbelief on my face. Tim. The perfect brother. The perfect person. Giving his life for me. 

""STOP!"" I yell. But no one stops. They expect this. It's common for brothers and sisters to not want their twin to die. Little do they know they're killing the wrong one. ""STOP! PLEASE!"" I fall to my knees, suddenly feeling very ill. This isn't right. How can this be happening. He deserves to live, not me. Why did he do this to himself? Why did he do this to me? Blackness began to takeover, so I let it.

____

""Tim? Tim, wake up."" 

I groaned as I shifted around on a bed I don't remember getting into. I rubbed near my eyes, which had dried tears on them. The memories of the ceremony came back to me to make fresh ones again. I sit up on the hospital bed and shudder.

""How can this have happened..."" I whisper to myself.

""It was meant to be"" Says the priest sitting next to my bed, whose name is apparently Myself. ""You were the superior species. Don't worry, it is best this way""

I groaned at the situation. No one could understand what I feel like right now. I had the perfect brother. Now I don't. And he's dead because of me. 

I look up, suddenly determined. 

I'm not going to let his death be meaningless.

I'll be even better than he was.

I'll be Tim Stevenson. Better than Jim ever was.

 [**Miller–Urey experiment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey%20experiment): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Miller–Urey experiment__  (or __Miller experiment__)  was a chemical [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) that simulated the conditions thought at the time to be present on the [early Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Earth), and tested the [chemical origin of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis). Specifically, the experiment tested [Alexander Oparin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Oparin)'s and [J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane)'s hypothesis that conditions on the primitive Earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized more complex [organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound) from simpler inorganic precursors. Considered to be the classic experiment investigating [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis), it was conducted in 1952  by [Stanley Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Miller), under the supervision of [Harold Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey), at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago) and later the [University of California, San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego) and published the following year.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;Most European countries live under religious rule and the Vatican City is in Europe for crying out loud.

True, but Europe also has lower rates of church attendance and a larger fraction of their population identifies as non-believers. And that's my point - the fact that attitudes have changed doesn't negate the fact that they were 'inherited' from the colonizing powers.

And it also supports my general thesis - medical culture bends to reflect societies' attitudes. In the US, when medicine was moving from a traditional to scientific basis, doctors already believed that circumcision was good and homosexuality was bad, so circumcision was deemed 'more hygienic' and homosexuality was a 'mental illness'. In the UK at the same time, circumcision was more of a passing fad of the upper class and homosexuality was bad, so homosexuality was also a 'mental illness' there, while circumcision was treated as a purely religious issue.

And the fact that there's so much turnover of justification strongly supports that the UK happened to be correct on this one point - every generation of American men gets circumcised, but for a different reason, every generation of doctors thinks to older justifications are silly, but the new one is rock-solid. The strongest historical reason was probably cervical cancer - properly done epidemiological studies in the US supported it - and then the HPV-cancer link was discovered and when corrected for, the link disappeared. Then all of the sudden it's time to make HIV the justification *du jour*.

Or as I once heard it put: Circumcision is a cure in search of a disease.

&gt;Online doctors gave me good non-emotional information. Intactivists were extremely emotional and lacked good information.

Doctors are more likely to be calm and objective sounding than activist groups, yes. So if you want to make a good comparison go talk to doctors who are opposed - ask those European medical groups why they disagree with their American peers, and skip the online no-nothings.

&gt;Because infants won't remember the procedure.

Again, give me some other situation where that argument is generally accepted. In every example I can come up with - from 'borrowing' someone's car while their on vacation to having sex with an unconscious person - 'they don't remember' simply isn't a defense.","1422748817"

"socialanxiety","t5_2r22n","A 30 year old guy in the next block jumped of 11th floor, apparently was depressed, feeling lonely. Depressed the fuck out of me and my family. My grandmother is sick and my mom and aunt are absolutely tired of taking care of her for 6 months. Last year was filled with death, 3 other elder relatives have died.

Since the finals I have been feeling really lonely again, I made huge progress, I don't exactly have much anxiety anymore besides for presentations (failed the class a 2nd time this year, I don't know how I'll pass it actually). Been very outgoing, was getting called to football matches every week. But with winter I feel like I have been forgotten, and while I don't get much anxiety, after every interaction I have to worry about if I did/say something stupid. I also feel like while people hang out with me, I am not really ''good friends'' with any of them. I have no friends who I can actually open up to, partly also because I think it'd be embarrassing to say that I basically had no life for the entire high school years.

Played ''Life is Strange'' just today, I think those of you who like games would like it a lot. I felt like Max is kind of similar to us. And a bit similar to me. 

Even though this is a throw away I have doubts clicking save.

So tired of acting happy while I have to spend time everyday worrying about my future, what jobs I will take, if anyone will ever love me, if I'll end up like Mr Duffy in ''A Painful Case''.","1422748822"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Picking into an unfavorable matchup is one thing--disrespecting the stronger botlane and taking bad trades is another.

For example, a Vayne against a Caitlyn of the skill level cannot win lane, and if Vayne  gets cocky and tries to go in for dangerous farm or trade/outplay early, she will get chunked and poked out of lane. You have to recognize this and stay back and let Vayne's scaling do its work.

I think Piglet played terribly and was way too cocky. You can stay even or fall a little behind as Sivir when playing vs Kallista if you just stay back and try not to trade (playing safe). But as you saw, Piglet tried to go up for CS that was out of his zone, or tried to harass/trade, prompting Sneaky to dodge and beat Piglet down with autos and Rend stacks. He disrespected the 1v2 situation when Xpecial left lane and got chunked. He disrespected Annie support's all in zone from the bush again when he was alone and died for it. He picked cleanse, an extremely sub-optimal spell in most situations, and did not even make use of it. He played terribly and there's no excuse. It was Piglet playing badly, not the matchup or their focus onto him.

TL;DR: Don't downplay Piglet's shitty play, it is all on him. Even with the focus comp of C9 and their favorable botlane matchup, there are ways to play safe in order to avoid giving them the huge advantage that they got. He was too cocky. ","1422748823"

"MyLittleHouseOfFun","t5_34hyk","So the way the backgrounds work is that it makes sure they fill the whole screen. If it's too small it upscales and if it's too large it crops. It always maintains aspect ratio. I can try to see if there is a way to make it downscale instead of cropping, but I don't think there is a simple solution using pure css. 

Aside from that I would have to choose a smaller version of the image to begin with. I went with the biggest size since that would support the most screens without having to upscale.

edit: sorry, let me correct that. It is currently downscaling to fit the width. It is cutting off the top and bottom because the image has a fairly square aspect ratio. On my screen at least I still see a decent amount of both light and dark.

The reason the game ultimately looked like shit, was the fact that Ubisoft decided to not make the consoles look so bad in comparison to the PC(probably a deal with MS or Sony), so what they did was tone down the graphics on the PC.

Today's police unions *are* too powerful

I cannot speak for all the labor unions that caused the whole unions are bad thing but if it weren't for unions we would not have the 40 hour work week, 8 hour day, and other basic labor rights.  

I think it may have been the auto workers unions that fucked it up for everyone. But the American people have been told that unions are bad, and in my case I have been hearing it since before I even knew what they were.  As I have gotten older I now see the need for them while also understanding that they have the potential to become monsters with their own agendas.  Like many things in life,  it is complicated and I don't know enough say beyond what I have.


The subject is seems taboo in America and it's weird to me that that is the case. ","1422748827"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I think a lot of folks are looking at this a little too narrowly, in that the thinking is that the whole shitfest that was the War of the Five Kings could have been avoided is Ned would have done things differently.  We need to look past a few permutations of subsequent events in order to view this:

LF's help vs. Renly's help: First thing I have to say about this is that Cat, who Ned trusts and loves as his wife, vouches for him.  Ned seemed to have his reservations, but he deferred to her thoughts on the matter, which was a mistake, as we all found out.  Let's see what happens if instead of accepting LF's help, he accepts Renly's.  Renly wants the crown, that's why he's offering Ned his support.  If Ned accepts, he's backing Renly's claim.  Amongst the people who have knowledge of the children's true parentage, who has the *best* claim? The Fucking Mannis, that's who.  Stannis has sort of been MIA for a long time; he, along with Jon Arryn, knew things.  Why go MIA? To prepare for certain eventualities, in this case, Robert's death.  Stannis was readying for the inevitable war that was about to ensue at the precise moment Robert died.  So by accepting Renly's help and backing his claim, Ned is basically giving the finger to Stannis and saying ""come at me, bro.""  This would even be the inevitable outcome if he served as Regent for Joffrey as well.

Then we come to the Lannisters:  Assume Ned backs Renly.  In addition to Stannis getting pissed, the Lannisters are also pissed, since Ned is coming out and saying ""You know the kids that are in line for the throne?  Yeah, they're the product of incest between the Queen and her bro.""  This would not go over well.  Cersei would either have to be killed or flee, and any way you look at it, there's gonna be war with the Lannisters in addition to The Fucking Mannis.    Now assume he backs Joffrey as Regent.  Best case is he still gets embroiled in the middle of a massive war between Lannister and Stannis, with the addition of Renly thrown in there as well.  With him involved, the North will have to become involved in some fashion, so war is still gonna tear up the realm.

FURTHERMORE:  He knows the truth about Joffrey and siblings.  Other people who know this know that he knows.  Some of these people are actively plotting to get a Dragon back on the throne.  He's a wildcard.  The knowledge he has can make him an ally to some, and an enemy to others, and whichever he chooses for allies, the others will most certainly be enemies.  So suppose he survives the inevitable war; either the Baratheons are defeated, or the Lannisters are.  The realm is weakened, and when a Dragon inevitably returns, he's stuck in the middle of that, as he'll either be Hand or Regent (unless he's dead, which, yeah...).

Bottom line: The second Ned accepting becoming Hand, he was fucked, the realm was fucked, his family was fucked, everything was fucking fucked.  Hell, even if he didn't accept, everything probably would have still been fucked.

Moral of the story:  Everything is fucked.  The Game of Thrones is fucked.  The Long Night is coming, and all the scheming and killing will be for nothing as the realm will be torn asunder by Ice and Fire regardless.","1422748830"

You're still challenging the identity of an entire class of people, whether the specific person that you're referring to is there or not.

No, but I use the other common names for him.  I don't tell people that there's nothing holy about him or contradict that title in some other way when it's not appropriate.

&gt;And if I insisted that 'you' is not an acceptable pronoun for me, but I would rather 'johrim' instead of 'you' or 'johrouer' instead of 'your', would you entertain that request, simply because identify differently?

Sure.  I'd ask why, because I'd be curious, but it's not my decision to make.  Where does ""johrim"" even come from, and what does it mean?  I understand how an agender identity could occur and what it means, as there's biological precedent, but I don't even know what the root of your pronouns are.

The bigger question is, why do you care so much?  Is there some sanctity that you see in the gender dichotomy that I'm not aware of?  Why challenge a part of someone's identity that has no real negative repercussions?","1422748831"

Earthquakes are propagations of energy. Fracking will cause earthquakes 100% of the time. However most of them are tiny releases of energy. Every once in a while you get one that's actually detectable by everyday people on the surface.

The offense comes back better than before, emboldened by the resigning of Cobb and the development of Adams and Rodgers into all star position players.

The defense comes out in post season form; and to the rest of the league's horror, Mathews and Peppers now know how to play together perfectly complimenting the others play style.

I know that one injury was of a freak nature but I'm scared to have him on my DL for half the year again. I know that every pitcher is a time bomb and all but Cobb ""burned"" me before. I also think Stroman is going to be on the better team than Cobb. 

Seager isn't as sexy as Posey and his MVP and rings. But he is a damn good third baseman and 3rd is shallow compared to catcher. I can see that keeping one of the best at the position would hurt everyone else as much as it would help me. ","1422748834"

Keep swapping Judgement targets for Double Jeopardy, and to keep Censure on both. Don't pull out Hammer of the Righteous until there's Remnants out in P4, but definitely Storm on two targets.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; I'll admit my computer skills are only those of someone who has grown up with them--I can work them and trouble-shoot most issues myself, but I know pretty much nothing when it comes to more complex things such as how compression works, file types, and so on.

And you shouldn't have to. Think how many officers are from the generation before ours. They're still fine officers and they should have an easy way to just drop it in and call it a day.

&gt; I'm looking to go into the AST myself within the next two years if everything works out, but I can only imagine what it will/does feel like to know your back-up is 200+ miles away.

Pass. Not for me, I'm afraid. I couldn't do LE work anyhow. Just the thought of dealing with drunks, addicts and desperate career criminals is too stressful for me.

&gt; I was talking about going back and reviewing footage for case follow-up. But I believe the AXON body camera system is set up exactly like that--hence their additional annual fee for that process as well.

Ah, the annual fee. Nice thing though is that it would have the officer's time-stamp, maybe even GPS stamping, and could easily be located as needed.

&gt; I will read your linked article when I get a moment; and I apologize if what I'm about to link you to is wrong due to anything you know or is written in that article. They are both fairly lengthy, so I understand if you quit half-way through.

You callin' me a quitter, bro? Just for that, I'm going to read them! (ha ha, sure showed him!)

The first link I actually read when it was fresh. The second one I hadn't seen, but it's still using uncompressed figures. Not uncompressed so much as not smart-compressed. Cameras are still quite a ways from doing that, but it's easily handled on the backend. Especially since it doesn't need to be done in real time and can be scheduled for times when server load is low.

Handling all officer data would be a big task, but it's already one that is feasible. Especially when you factor in the savings reaped by departments with already-bloated budgets for doing this, it wouldn't cost nearly as much as you might think.

1.  I used to work at a site where no PEDs (Personal Electronic Devices) were permitted.  Phones, laptops, MP3 players, and everything of the sort had to be stashed in a locker in the lobby before you were allowed in the building.  Yes, I still had a clock on my computer, but I wouldn't be at my desk all day.

2.  As people have said, battery life.  My phone has shocking battery life, and I use it heavily, reading stuff on my phone on the train to and from work.  It's not uncommon for it to die halfway through the day.  By contrast, my watch has a spring and a small swinging weight that winds it up when I swing my wrist.  As long as I wear it, it will literally never run out of power.

3.  I find my watch has a psychological impact on me, and it helps me work better.  Sure, it's a piece of jewellery in a sense, but it's also a nice reminder of the incessant passing of time.  I use my watch as a psychological anchor for work/play.  Right now, I'm messing around on reddit, so my watch is sitting on the table beside me.  In a few minutes, I'll put it back on, and go to work.

4.  A good watch is, in my opinion, the ultimate fusion of form and function.  Engineering and artistry brought together.  I'd much rather wear that than any other piece of jewellery.","1422748842"

"programming","t5_2fwo","The argument is that it's simpler, more consistent and looks nicer than the equivalent bash.

Inheriting a bunch of bash scripts is far more daunting than a bunch of fish scripts if you have no prior shell scripting experience (just like inheriting a bunch of templated C++ code with little prior C++ experience).

Once you start needing some of the more advanced features of bash, you should probably rewrite it a real programming language anyway. At work, we've recently been switching most of our bash scripts to python for just this reason.

If you want to make something portable, you need to use Bourne Shell, which is quite a bit more restricted. I've given up trying to make portable shell scripts, so now I either write in fish (for simple scripts) or python (for things that need to be portable).","1422748843"

"fatestaynight","t5_31xwr","&gt;Berserker's ""precognition"" is just Eye of the Mind (False). That lets him decipher feints and tricks in battle, not tell when someone is trying to ventilate his master from 500 meters away. 

funny because I recall the text explicitly saying it does just that

&gt;More importantly than any of that, being able to survive an Origin Round =/= being able to defeat Kiritsugu. Remember the dossier Kirei reads? ""Sniping. Poisoning. Bombs in public places."" The first mage we see Kiritsugu go up against, he blows up the building the man is standing in. That's what the masters would have to face. Not a man with a fancy gun.

But then I could tell you a story of Shinji winning the war and make it seem convincing. After all if Origin bullets aren't anything special then theres nothing stopping him from putting bombs in public places either. 

Mundane means of attack surprise magi who think in terms magic duels.
There aren't any in the fifth war besides Rin. Without the element of surprise even basic magic can make a bulk of these methods instantly useless. There's a reason everybody doesn't run around pulling the same tricks as Kiritsugu.


Of course you could come up with a scenario where a magus killer manages to single handedly take the war(hello Hollow Ataraxia). If you ignore Kuzuki and Caster and Zouken and Kirei (and Bazett for that matter)and ignore the fact that these are the people Shirou and Rin manage to beat and allow that said killer has perfect knowledge of the situation and luck and that origin bullets are just tiny nobel phantasms that work on everything magic instead of normal magic circuits being fired at full burst at them.

The story while a step up to dead island, isn't really a great story when you compare it to another standard game however.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","I was a monster in my early teens. I would rage out over nothing, break things, I was unable to concentrate at school and moved schools several time due to poor academic performance and bad behaviour until my parents were barely able to cope being very young themselves and they finally look in to medical cannabis and put me in a montessori school, where I seemed to do better.

Cannabis did many things, it slowed me down, gave me introspection in to my behaviour, and seemed to balance my mood. It was like I was able to slow down, take a step back and see what a shit I was. The knock on effect of all this was that I was able to find motivation and I was far less susceptible to mood swings and outbursts. 

As I said I'm now in my 2nd year of uni at Melbourne University. I feel that had I been put on traditional medications I may have wound up like a walking zombie and not been nearly as successful or happy as I am today. ","1422748845"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","I  like being religious, it helps me a lot and given me a lot of motivation. I was Christian but ran into some issues with the person of Jesus Christ pbuh. While he is amazing, I didn't see him as God and I was aware of embellishments in the Gospels, and it caused me to have some doubts. Not that doubt is a bad thing, it matures faith. However, I experienced a lot of church hurt and I became so disingenuous and cynical about Christianity, that I decided it was no longer productive. In fact, I was a promiscuous coke-addict for a vast last  segment of my Christian walk. I was still worship leading, speaking in tongues (I was Pentecostal), serving in various positions of leadership, and reading my Bible, but it was no longer connecting. So, I ended up taking a break from my Ph.D. and moved back from LA to NYC to get my life together.

I looked into Abrahamic faiths that accept Jesus Christ pbuh, and read some books by Western scholars, have conversations with friends, and decided to practice Islam. Not that it's been skipping through tulips since then; I find some problems with Islam just like I had in Christianity. Sometimes, it feels like I have more problems with Islam. But the way I choose to practice it had helped me a lot. Maybe it's in my head or maybe it's God, I don't know. ","1422748845"

Also, practice makes you perfect. Keep on blending. To prevent the colours from mixing and looking muddy, purchase a primer and perhaps an eyeshadow base.

Looks like you were going for a halo eye, meaning the brighter tone is in the middle of the lid and surrounded by a darker shade. Blending and usage of a primer are the most crucial steps to improve cleanliness.

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","When a correction happens deflation is part of the natural clearing out process. 

&gt; Most people consider firing people a worse social outcome than cutting wages

Yes, but when governments dictate a minimum wage this cannot be an option. People therefore lose their jobs.

&gt; So an inflationary environment might be preferable to a deflationary one for this reason. 

Preferable to who? To an uncompetitive business? To a business loaded with debt? To a government that wants to inflate its debt away instead of actually cutting spending like it should?

America didn't become the greatest economy in the world during inflationary times. It built its economy during the 18th and 19th centuries which were overall deflationary periods of great growth and falling prices. It wasn't until the 20th century that this idea of inflating became de rigour, and that was because governments needed to finance their welfare systems without taxing their citizens to death, and now it's all coming home to roost.

Governments love inflation because it means they can spend the wealth of the unborn.

&gt; though most would agree that there are better ways to reduce poverty.

Such as creating real growth instead of trying to artificially stimulate it with low interest rates and QE (I haven't read those links. Later).","1422748846"

You will also be available in case of emergencies as a first responder. You will facilitate getting ems or paramedics on scene and to patients. You can also help with searches and finding lost hikers etc. 

If you are also a generalist then you will help with resource management, giving guided hikes, programs, interpretation, events, etc.

The academy will train you on how to do searches, arrest, law code, patrol techniques. It really depends on your department and what your standard operating procedures are. 

On a daily basis you will be driving around, talking with park visitors, responding to any calls, enforcing rules, and telling a lot of people to put their dog on a leash.","1422748849"

AWALT means don't think your wife is a snowflake princess unicorn.

But, don't assume that AWALT when it comes to comparing to marriage-possible women with the girl you picked up at the bar who can do shots, has tattoos and piercings and pink hair.

AWALT, but NAWAL (not all women are losers).

If you prefer banging losers, don't get married.  If you HAVE dated marriage-worthy women who don't have loser tendencies, then you can see some value in taking the risk.

I start businesses every year.  Huge risk.  ABALT.  Most fail.  But I take the risk because there are rewards.

Why don't 90% of TRP guys start businesses?  Because the risk is too high.  You can lose everything.  Easier to just work one job after another.

"askswitzerland","t5_2tob7","Well for history the [""Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz""](http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/index.php) is a great resource, but it is only available in German, French and Italian.

[""Geschichte der Schweiz"" by Thomas Meissen](http://www.amazon.de/Geschichte-Schweiz-Thomas-Maissen/dp/3039191748) is a good summary of Swiss history, but again just in German.

The only resource on Swiss history I know available in English is Wikipedia. It has topics on a lot of things and is pretty extensive. Haven't found any major mistakes either.

I found [""Swiss History in a Nutshell""](http://www.bergli.ch/100/con_liste.asp?prono=20&amp;ica=7&amp;vSearch=&amp;nCurPage=&amp;sStartPageNext=&amp;caller=list), but it sounds more journalistic. I can't tell you if it's any good since I didn't read it. (and bergli.ch probably does not ship to the USA ;)

I always switch to English too when I meet a foreigner who doesn't speak German well. It's just more efficient, but next time you should ask to stay in German, because you like to learn it. Most people will take the time and speak in simple/slow German with you.

That being said, if you really wish to come back and possibly live here you should learn German, French or Italian. Otherwise you will have an even harder time fitting in. Finding friends in Switzerland can be very hard, because usually you find new friends by going out with old friends.

One child a day falls victim to unexploded ordnance from NATO bombings in Afghanistan.

Foreign soldiers have also used valleys, fields and dry riverbeds as firing ranges and left them peppered with undetonated ammunition.

It's quite disturbing to watch politicians behave like this.

&gt;Do you think their constituents elected them to go to Washington to implement the will of the Democrats?

Of course not, I think they elected them in the hopes that they would stand for the values that they claimed they stood for, which apparently takes priority over making a president look bad for things he is not responsible for (instead of pointing out the real bullshit he does, like defending the NSA, betraying his promise to deal with guantanamo, or appointing Wheeler fo the FCC).

FTC investigation into Herbalife is ongoing.

2) Herbalife does not collect retail sales data, making case building that much more timely and costly. 

3) Herbalife and the DSA have a lot of political influence.  They have used lobby power to keep AGs out of their business for a long time.

4) Lack of formal complaints from former distributors.  The cult-ish nature of business opportunity scams teaches people to believe that failure is of their own doing.

There's a lot to criticize in his work, to be sure, and two of his harshest critics are Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  They're the guys with a TV show featuring a talking piece of poo, the writers of the classic movie tune ""Uncle Fucker,"" and groundbreaking directors in the area of puppet sex on film.


The network which airs their show (a subsidiary of media giant Viacom) also once had a hit series that featured sketches about a black white supremacist and a white family named ""The Niggars.""

We're in the middle of space, and around us are millions of planets, other milky ways/galaxys. Full of more planets which could even have life on it

Maybe some could even be this life just with different things. Stuff like ""Why are we here, where do we go when we die..etc""

It's just really weird to think about that stuff. Along with how people think the Area 51 have all this amazing hidden stuff, time travelling, teleporting, UFOs that can zoom light years away in seconds.

Space is a weird place. I would go on about the Sea too like how we know more about space than our actual sea thats been here for years and years as it's so big and deep and just not possible to explore..etc

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Have you ever made a monthly budget?

Of course, and alcohol fit in rather easily even when I had almost no disposable income. Keep in mind I live in Canada where alcohol is around 2-3 times as expensive on average. If you're spending a large portion of your disposable income on alcohol then you're drinking too much or buying expensive alcohol/going to bars. Higher alcohol taxes do price poor people out of bars, but bars are generally pretty expensive for the poor anyway. 

&gt; It would be making life harder for people who already have hard lives.

They'd drink less. Not everyone would drink less mind you, but many would. Also the tax revenue can ideally help pay for social services for the poor.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Honestly, don't let her kite you. I'm only silver 5 this season but I was silver 2 last season and I've been focusing straight on mechanics. So, while this may not work for the higher elos, I have outplayed gold 2 players and gold 1 while playing with a friend who is plat 2. The important part with her is to run away once she gets spears in you, and get out of her E range until the spears disappear. They last around 10 seconds, probably less from the last AA, so if you can escape her and get out of that range you'll be golden. The other is plan to slow her before she starts running, and her jumps will be slow.

If you have any questions, my league name is Redlight Rampage, and I am more then willing to play a custom game or 2 with you so you can see how she works and how i play her, even tho I'm a low elo. The other important thing is you gotta keep an eye on her ult, since i've been manning her, i've been able to keep a support alive by making blitz, thresh, morgana, leona, graves, shaco, xerath, and all other CC champions miss terribly because of a quick ult and pulling a low health support into me. 

She is squishy as all hell and does nearly no damage if you can get her oathsworn out of range and or dead before attacking her. Once you start, waste your flash on her, it sounds silly but otherwise you'll just get messed up if the other player is any good at shift clicking.

For PVE, grind Vanguard faction rep (to get Rank) and marks. Patrols and bounties will get you rep. Strikes, Daily Heroics, and Weeklies will get you rep + marks. Public Events (on patrol) will get you marks and/or ascendant materials.

Unless you mainly focus on PVP, do not buy a faction class item until you've hit Rank 4+ in Vanguard (I got faction'd up when I hit Vanguard Rank 9).

I wouldn't bother upgrading Rare armor much, because I went through progressively better and better pieces very, very quickly. After getting some marks and rep, buy Vanguard greaves. Buy Vanguard gauntlets if you want, but if you have the DLC, the Eris urn quest (purple ""bounty"") will give you Legendary gauntlets at the end. See if Xur has a good exotic armor piece for your class on the weekend after you have enough Strange Coins to buy one. If he does, buy it. Then, buy the Vanguard armor piece that complements it (Exotic helmet -&gt; Vanguard chestpiece, Exotic chest -&gt; Vanguard helm). If he doesn't, no biggie, cross you fingers and hope he has one the next weekend.

A full suit of vendor Legendary + 1 Exotic, maxed out, will get you to L31.","1422748865"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","There is no prevalence in D&amp;D. I'm in the process of making the races of Everquest 5E compatible. I'm attempting to create racial bios that are based off of Everquest lore but vague enough to use in any campaign. 

Sony and EQ had published an entire book series in 3.5 in order to play Everquest on the tabletop. Before I could get a game together my play group switched to 5E. (It truly is just more streamlined and simpler.) So I wanted to be able to have the ability to run a game based off of Everquest. 

So, I homebrewed the races of Everquest to be able to be played in 5E. I'll be posted them all throughout the week. If people enjoy them and are interesting, I may start to home brew the different classes of Everquest not already in the basic rules of D&amp;D 5E. ","1422748865"

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","Positives about advanced CSS over handling with JS:

* The code runs on its own thread
* The code often runs orders of magnitude faster
* The code can sometimes even leverage GPU

You'll probably never need to know how to make a Simpsons character or 99% of the super-fancy CSS3 stuff you see on CodePen. In the vast majority of use cases, advanced CSS techniques are really easy to understand (though verbose and not really necessary to memorize). Just take half an hour and look at what you *can* do, then maybe you'll get an idea on your next project. Chances are it'll only take a few minutes from there to implement.

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","I don't agree with you to be honest, I just think that Ozil is playing within himself at Arsenal. The difference between the Ozil we see at Real Madrid and Arsenal is that he was more expressive at Real Madrid. I mean just look at the video, he's more willing to dribble at players when he was at Madrid. 

I also think it’s a myth that counter attack is the style that suits him best. Think about it, best assets are his vision and final ball. So basically he's the no 1 person we look at whenever hope to unlock a team who just sits deep and defends. If you look at 7:53 in the video you see Ozil surrounded by 4 or 5 players and he still manages to find a way out. That's him at his utmost best, that's what we paid the 42 mill for. 

Personally, I don't think it’s a matter of him not being utilized properly (unless you're talking about him being played on the wing) but more so in the fact that he lacks confidence, plays in a more conservative and risk-averse manner for arsenal in comparison to the way he did at Madrid.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

His monthly rent was about $500 USD, and the ticket I bought him to Europe was $600 USD. I was more than happy to give him that gift because he's been down in the dumps lately and I wanted to see him. Yes, I also wanted company, but I specifically wanted his company.

Also fyi, what ended up happening is that Peter came to Europe. He invited two of his friends to stay at our rental house without asking, and when I found out, I told him it was OK for a couple days. Him and his friends ate all of our food, kept pushing me to buy them alcohol, wore my clothes without asking, and his friends slept in the living room until 4PM every day, making things really awkward for my mom and I who actually wanted to enjoy the house we had paid for and explore Berlin. 

In the end, they stayed for 5 days... I kept having to remind him that we were moving to a smaller flat soon and there just wouldn't be room for them there, but he avoided dealing with it. Eventually, when his friends mentioned they were staying 5 more days, I had to tell him I really couldn't host his friends any longer, and he flipped his shit. Ended up leaving with them and I haven't talked to him since. 

So, yeah sure, I'm not perfect. But I was a damn good friend here and as it turns out, Peter is just a middle-aged irresponsible piece of shit.","1422748871"

The issue is that it is now interfering with your ability to function in social situations and has impacted your emotional state. That is a transition from a personality trait to an actual disorder. I would highly recommend getting a consultation with an mental health professional that specializes in eating disorders. They know how to handle these things. It is likely that there is a Generalized Anxiety Disorder or depressed state that is underlying these actions/emotions. Treatment of the underlying disease is likely to help with this disordered eating pattern. ","1422748873"

One trick I learned when dealing with big telco's (in my case Telstra in Aus and I was working in ADSL provisioning trying to setup internet for customers of our small ISP) was to always take notes get the name of the person you spoke to and reference numbers (or audio record if legal in your area). Note down times etc.

It makes the operator aware at the other end that you aren't a pushover and will follow up. Usually (not always) this makes them pull their head out of their arse and actually do their job because there is a risk you might actually report them to their boss.

It will help your case if you can do some testing and prove its their line. Eg not only affecting MWO but all other services during that timeframe.

"amiibo","t5_324pu","My favorite moment with does not have Bowser himself in it but the game we were playing was themed around him so I think it counts. Me and my friends play Mario Party 4 nearly every time we hang out at my place. It was the 4th last turn of the game and I was in third. My friend playing Daisy landed on a battle game space and as tradition, if Bowser's Bigger Blast is up for choice it has to be picked, no exceptions. So as we start playing I go with my classic strategy of picking only green because I only play Luigi. My friends and I never triggered the bomb on the first set. When it reset the levers I picked green again on my go and was safe and same with my friends. Two rounds in a row on Bowser's Bigger Blast with no deaths has never happened so needless to say we were tense as hell. Then the third round we still had no eliminations, you could cut the tension with a knife at this point. Then finally DK got eliminated and then Wario did. It was down to me and Daisy. Picking green was working out greatly for me at this point but my friend took notice of that and pulled the green lever on me before I could go. But, unfortunately for him it was the one time the green lever triggered the bomb. The room exploded with profanity from everyone and major bragging from me. But it didn't end there. My three asshole friends made it there goal to screw me over of the coins I won in that game because if I kept all those coins I would have won because we had the equal amount of stars including the coin star they knew I had in my pocket. I don't remember who but someone landed on a Bowser square and got revolution splitting all the coins equally. When the game ended the stars got tallied and I ended up with 2 of the three bonus stars, the coin star and the minigame star. So I won, which never happens, and just as if it couldn't get any worse for my poor sport friends when we looked at the tallies that determined the minigame coins earned, I was ahead of Daisy by 2 coins. I don't exactly remember if the battlegames added to that total but to this day I hold it over my friends head that he lost by 2 coins in Mario Part 4. I still like to think that the Bowser's Blast game was what made me win that game. It is easily my favorite Bowser related moment because it is brought up on a regular basis on our Mario Party weekends.","1422748875"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","There are literally hundreds of websites out there to find specific geographical information. I look for mainstream scientific sites and carefully read through information presented. 

I have found a lot of what they offer is often based on theory or hypothesis.. wether it is based on mainstream geology or specific personal opinion. Look carefully for photographic evidence to back everything you are meant to just accept as the best scenario..

There is a strong case for 'seeing is believing' and I rely on my own eye and mind and hard evidence to decipher what I am seeing and being presented. I am no longer afraid to call to question greater human minds than my own.

Question everything. Just because it is seemingly being presented as scientific fact does not necessarily mean it actually is..everything I had accepted as truth once, I can see being perpetrated by our own selves who have not stood up and questioned loudly..."" But how do you know this to be so?"" Call a theory a theory. And a stone cold fact, a fact.

Read everything carefully and decipher what facts are possible to know for absolute truth in a scientifically sound and correct manner. You will be surprised at the amount of scientific theory our knowledge hinges apon. Things I had used to believe were factual truth.

I know my life has changed since I began to believe. And although I cannot prove this to everyone  - it is very evident to those around me who knew me well before. I am a different person on the inside, outwardly my life has changed.

This is evidence to me that God is guiding me, creating in me a new heart, enabling me to change. I read his word and have come to love and trust him. I sincerely believe he instructed his writer to specifically tell us the world was created in six earth days and so I do not question it, if he had created the world in the manner according to the pope then why tell us a lie? He does not lie. 

What I must do now is question what the textbooks are teaching the world. It is an eye opening experience to do so. It does not take much to see how much of science has been misrepresented by modern man. When we view true science we can see a little of the brilliant mind of the creator. 

I have grown to love truth. Delve a little into websites that present very advanced early civilisations and out of place archeological artifacts. 'Alien seeding' theories abound but brushing those aside, man was incredibly advanced thousands and thousands of years ago which does not fit what we were taught in school. 

Being a bible believing Christian is not always a smooth road. The ridiculing and vilification of going against what 'everyone' else believes, sadly even from others who are supposed to love and support you in your own Christian communities, is not always easy going.. But if you are like me, there's nothing more enlightening than following the path less travelled. The herd follows the broad road. The flock follows the shepherd safely guided by the shepherds footsteps.

I hope you spend time searching the wealth of information out there for yourself, it's enlightening and incredible and the amount of people even scientists themselves who are beginning to question the mainstream sciences is heartening..know the truth and the truth will set you free. Much love.","1422748875"

"twitchplayspokemon","t5_30dlp","Believe it or not. It was. My team lacked an fire-type and it could really use that type. And I already had Eevee so why not.

When I came to Blue Flareon just ended to be the best matchup as most of Blue's team is strong against Fire-Types was there no reason to not use it. Most of my team was low on HP aswell and having a battle with a Pokemon that most likely would outspeed them would be a disaster. Flareon had Quick-attack so I could atleast do some damage (although I did end up using Ember instead as it did way more damage). Pidgeot kept using mirror-move for a few turns (coincidence?) which fails when used before the opponent moves (I was using Ember now) so I could do some decent damage to it. Atfer Pidgeot started to glow I knew that switching would be pointless as every other Pokemon would just get obliterated as soon as it was send out. So I decided to pull of one last Quick-attack instead. Sacrificing Flareon in the process.

TPP Didn't even cross my mind until I saw the name of the move. At which point it was already too late for Flareon...","1422748877"
"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Hey, between the two laptops you suggested, I would honestly go for the lenovo. On a laptop screen, 4k is really unnecessary, and to be honest, you probably won't be able to visually differentiate between that and 1080p until you get into pretty large screen formats. Besides that though, the dell will definitely have a nicer screen, color wise, and the lenovo will be more powerful. 

Alternatively, I offer you a different solution: The Asus Q550LF. The model with the dedicated 745M. It's blazing fast, near perfect color accuracy on the screen, touchscreen, backlit keyboard, metal chassis, and overall decent build quality. All for less than $1000 if you know where to look. Between that laptop and my desktop, I would gladly use the laptop if it weren't for the dual monitors i have on my desktop.

7 is a Polaroid flash gun, not 100% sure offhand but I think its just a flash for polaroid cameras (many use single use bulbs).

8 are slide mounts,  turns your film into slides for projecters. 

9 and 13 are medium format film backs for a camera, not sure which one offhand but if there are big square cameras he also left you then it might be 1 (2?) Of them. Also could be worth some decent money depending on the body they go to.

10 &amp;12 are flashes for the cameras the Vivitar flash is cheap, maybe like $5 $10 tops on ebay.

11 is a battery pack it looks like for the flashes

15 looks like an extra flash cable

16 I think it was looked like holders for the enlarger

And 17 looks like it might be a timer for the enlarger as well. 

if you're not interested in keeping anything most of it will be worth a few bucks, definitely the enlarger kit and the film backs. I'm bored at work so I can see if I can find a body and price for the backs.

Question Answer: As supreme ruler, my first course of action would be to begin tackling the problems in our animal shelters, working towards the goal of cutting down on euthanasia while reducing pet overpopulation. I would work with a team of educated advisers. Secondly, I would eat food. So. Much. Good. Food. Then handle other issues, like homelessness, and other such bad things. Then more food. Then I'd purchase a farm, and adopt children. Then eat more food. And have goats. I would become a world renowned goat breeder, breeding the largest goats this world has ever seen. ""Supreme leader,"" people would say, ""How can you spend so much time with your goats when the people need you?"" And I would look out the world and say, ""The goats are the real leaders.""

There is a wiring harness difference also, as the T5 car has the neutral safety switch (won't engage starter unless clutch pedal is depressed) that the AOD car does not have. The clutch pedal portion plugs in to either main harness, so it's not a hassle assuming you have the T5 harness.

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","If her argument were 'all games are sexist' and then she only picked negative examples while ignoring positive ones, then I think you could call that cherry picking. But her argument isn't that every game is sexist (or that 'games are sexist') but that there are sexist tropes that are widely used in games. She's not 'ignoring the positive examples' because she wants to say games are bad, she's focusing on the negative ones because her project is meant to be a look at negative tropes in video games.

'There are good examples too' doesn't discredit her point, which I think is what this counterpoint is meant to be doing. Why is she saying games are sexist (which she isn't), where there's all these positive examples? When are you going to mention the good ones, Anita? Claiming that she is 'cherry picking' bad examples is nonsense, because of course she is. Her entire project is look at negative examples. She's pointing out that there are hundreds of examples of these tropes in games. If she had picked like, 5 examples and then said 'see, it's everywhere!' then that might be cherry picking.

I have seen people suggest that some of the examples (the Dragon Age one in particular which I was told) lack context which explain things. On the one hand, I can see how if the game treated the trope with some depth then it's not as bad as just flat out repeating it. But on the other, you can still criticise why they decided to use that. You can handwave stuff and give in-universe explanations but that doesn't mean you can't criticise the creator's choices. Like lots of games have strip clubs and brothels because they're set in criminal/seedy underworlds, but why is that so prevalent as a setting/background? 

But it's hard to have decent critiques of her work when so much of the buzz around it involve claims she never made like ""games cause sexism and Mario should be banned.""","1422748882"

Anyway, on subject, don't worry about cranking an amp, it's perfectly safe. If your amp can't handle being played at a setting that the controls offer, it's obviously not built very well...  Just be sure to wear some earplugs.

EDIT: Oh, and this is a hybrid amplifier... Not totally tube, not totally solid state. It has two preamp tubes (12AX7s,) but the power section is solid state. This allows you to get the sound of a tube amp's distortion without the worry of your amp sounding radically different at higher volumes. It's also a bit more reliable and you don't have to have the amp re-biased when you retube it.

If you ever want to replace the tubes, they're in the back of your amp, under two heat sinks. Just twist them in either direction and they'll pop out. The tubes pop directly in and out of socket- don't twist them. http://i.imgur.com/ye1C8ty.png

I believe, given the pilots expertise, that they could be using his military knowledge to launch attacks on the US led aircraft that are attacking them.  I read last year that they [captured some Syrian fighter jets](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/islamic-state-isis-flaunts-captured-syrian-fighter-jets-in-video-showing-massacre-9720471.html), so maybe they could use him to attack the US and ally planes and/or the Kurds using one of these jets.  Obviously I can't see this being very successful, but it would be a major coup for ISIS to have their own fighter jet in the sky, merely for propaganda alone.

It's just a theory and it is more likely they have murdered the young man, but with them using propaganda to 'intimidate' their enemies and to recruit other would be Jihadis, just having a legit picture/video of a fighter jet in the air baring the ISIS flag would be a major propaganda coup for them...  and they do have someone now who can fly one competently.   

Again it's just a theory on why they haven't announced his condition and it's probably a silly theory, but if I had a few fighter jets and now a hostage who could fly one I know what I would do... but then again i'm not a barbaric, murderous religious fanatic so who knows.","1422748884"

"finance","t5_2qhfj","So I'll start with the second question first. Managers come to us, they our our clients. 

I'll go step by step for the first question as that'll probably make it easier to understand. After we've met a client and found out what they want, what they're skill set is etc. we start the search phase. This can go a bunch of different ways, but the most common ones are that we already know a company interested in selling, we know someone who is heavily involved in the industry or we do a database search.

Once we've found some potential companies for our client to acquire we set up meetings with the owners and hold preliminary discussions. If these go well, we'll sign an NDA and get their financials and start working on a valuation.

Once we have established a preliminary valuation, we generally make an informal offer. This is usually countered by the selling company, so it's a bit of a game to get a good company at a good price. Once the price/terms are pretty much settled we'll draft a letter of intent and go into due diligence. We do this in basically the same way that anyone else in the industry does it, except we tend to dig a lot deeper.

Once this is done, we close the deal and sometimes assist during the transition period.

Now, for how we make money. We charge a deal fee and a retainer to all of our clients, but where we make the big money and where our bonuses come from is an equity stake that we take in almost all of the companies that we acquire for our clients. We do this by structuring the deal so that our clients (and our) equity investments carry a lot more weight than the investments from outside investors. 

Hope that clarifies some stuff!","1422748885"

This hearing was pretty much to fine her more for not being able to pay the fees. This was the moment I realized that some people have it so tough and at times are trapped in financial burden the grows worse so easily. I assumed she couldn't even pay to get her car back. It made me quite sad that day.","1422748885"

In my state a traffic ticket won't do it.  But if you already have 3 or 4, the points on the license add up and they suspend the license to scare a bad driver into taking traffic law seriously. 

If that is true in this case, how many tickets does he have? And if it's driving commercially, who would hire him with so many violations?  And if he's teaching commercial driving to others, he can't claim he didn't know traffic laws.  

I just know with my commercial driver friends that they take the laws very seriously even in their own cars.   And some of them would be fired if they got more than 3 or 4 points on the license. 

So what I'm saying is I'm not convinced of the credibility of this guy.  Maybe he's one of those who can't seem to follow laws and it's always someone else's fault when penalties seem so unfair?  What is he not telling us? ","1422748888"
"books","t5_2qh4i","You should read Warbreaker, also by Sanderson, which could possibly expand on the second book a little if you reread it. I won't spoil the connection for you.

Other than that, you can read the mistborn series also by Sanderson.

If you would like a different author, like J_Sto said read The kingkiller Chronicles or possibly Codex Alera by Jim Butcher.

Codex I would say is good, but not as good as the Kingkiller book or Stormlight in my opinion.

The system, and response, you're describing however is pretty much exactly like what we had. The thing to bare in mind is that its part of these guys *job* to do this. The fact that these lectures are new is a *good* thing. I would have killed to have that kind of mountain because in that situation you just have to make sure that you're working *with* them rather than against them. My problem was that I was trying to tell very, very, smart people that their knowledge wasn't relevant anymore in the format that they were using. Much harder.

Academics are professional defenders, you start out at the end of your degree protecting your work from attack and from that point on you never stop. The good ones *like* being told when and how they are doing it wrong, but the 'how' is very important. The bad ones are in the wrong field. Some take it a little to personal but usually that's more of a bluster thing. I was quite surprised to find out that it was often BS. You don't get through your phD defense, let alone all of the conference defenses you'll have done to get to the point were they'll let you lecture, without being 'good' at taking criticism. 

I don't know what field you're in but 90% of departments, these guys are taking a pay hit to do this. A person capable of getting a phD will almost always make more money in the private sector than in uni. So they *want* this. Some people just need to be reminded that you're on their side.  

I grantee you most of them *want* to give good lectures. The NSS is often a very good kick up the arse for the heads of the department to provide the support and council that younger lectures need to improve.","1422748891"

"GraphicDesign","t5_2qrct","Having worked as a graphic designer for nearly 8 years and having done a graphic design diploma, I'd have to heavily disagree with your view.

Having a post-secondary education means that you've not only learned material, but were tested on it. You've had practical experience and likely a work-term.

It's one thing to learn Photoshop and Illustrator in your spare time. It's an entirely different thing to also learn art/design history, colour theory, marketing and advertising, etc — from a teacher who already understands these things and can answer questions. A degree/diploma proves that you didn't just read things, but were tested on them, retained that knowledge, and were able to apply it in real-world situations. It means that you had many projects to learn and gain better knowledge. It means that you've collaborated with other students on projects, which is important when working with a team. Most programs will also give you hands-on experience with printing equipment. Also, the projects you do and are graded on during your program are for the purpose of building your first portfolio.

When I did my two-year program, it was 2 years of Photoshop and Illustrator lessons, nearly every day, five days a week — complete with projects. It was learning marketing and advertising — and being able to apply those skills to make an effective ad or a good logo. It was learning photography and web design. It was networking with my teachers and students. At the end of my program, I had a three-month internship with a real advertising agency — which led to my first job of my career.

The papers are *proof* that you know your stuff. Getting hired when you're young and inexperienced is hard enough... you'd need to have a fucking *impressive* portfolio (or a complete lack of competition) to get hired without an education.","1422748892"

"news","t5_2qh3l","Whenever someone talks about a taboo subject they always get voted down. This in my opinion is not the best way to reach a logical conclusion or answer. Majoritarian views or politics can lead to very inaccurate conclusions. I think that most people form their political views on emotion and their current cultural surroundings. One has to really put forth a lot of effort to discover the reasons why we believe what we believe. To get to my point, victims of crimes will have a psychological impact. People in car accidents might have an aversion to driving or going to the scene of the accident. Someone who has never been in an accident will not really understand a persons aversion to a negative memory. Those that have been victims of a crime do unfortunately develop almost a pavlovian response. To prevent future negative actions against ones self, the brain records patterns that led to the negative stimuli. Unfortunately things like skin color, clothing, age, or any other sort of distinguishing features get recorded and associated with negative memory or stimuli. The brain creates an aversion to these patterns and it is expressed as caution, hatred, fear, or aggressiveness. To fight these feelings, is to fight a very powerful evolutionary part of our biology. Victims of crimes that lead to racist behavior are usually quite different than more liberal people living in safer neighborhoods. People that have never grew up in poverty like to talk and act like they know what goes on when they really don't. In my opinion those that have been victims of crime involving a specific race, sex, or age, that don't hold any suspicions when around those groups, are a product of modern life and medicine. In our past people unable to properly create accurate pictures of reality would have been eaten. I think many people in our society are unable to accurately weigh any given situation on the danger they may be in. Victims of crimes may get a little kick start in the area responsible for creating aversions,  non victims do not have these aversion yet, but they can be influenced by others becoming victims.

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","Since its a pier and beam house and 84 years old I wouldn't worry too much about foundation issues, they would be visible to you if present.  And pier and beam is easily corrected should there be an issue.  

I would be concerned about termites first, since the damage is not easily discovered to most homeowners.  Its the most expensive, and not likely to be covered on a HO policy.  

Next would be the age of water and sewer lines, both inside and out of the house, all the way to where city responsibility begins.  If the previous owners have lived there for a while they may have made some replacements.  If not and its galvanized supply lines and cast iron sewer you can anticipate some repairs.  

A house of that vintage is pretty leaky, air changes pretty often, more so than a house built in the last thirty years.  This is an important consideration for mold.  I would believe that this house is much less likely to harbor mold than a new home.  And if there was a mold issue, air quality is more similar to the outdoor air quality.  

Unless there have been some vast improvements in mold testing in the last 3-5 years I would pass on mold testing.  The tests I used previously were a comparison to outdoor air to indoor air, which isn't too helpful in a prevention or repair standpoint.  A better consideration for you may be an energy assessment, or duct/coil cleaning.

When he got there he searched through the house for a dropchest we were expecting to be there and didn't find one. Dekecoy tried to pearl liddledums for looking through his chests and breaking a block. We explained to him what happened and that Rugdoc has sent us there. This is why both Rugdoc &amp; Liddledums are in the snitch logs. I have my conversations with Rugdoc [here](http://imgur.com/a/mqnms)

You are a girl

You like girls

You want to be a guy.

From that, my personal advice, like that which I would give to a friend, is this: be careful. Come out to one person first, about your sexuality. If they respond well, then tell them about your gender dilemma. Make sure this is a person you sincerely trust, otherwise you run the risk of getting outed against your will. See how that goes, and weigh your options about telling more people.","1422748900"

Non-friable asbestos can be used in a variety of ways without risk of exposure. Lead, mercury, and arsenic can also be fatally toxic, but still have hundreds of applications in which they can be used safely.

What you seem to be driving at is that the CDC is in cahoots with big corporations, which influences their evaluation of health risks when it comes to mold. But that really doesn't make any sense. No one is mining mold. No one is manufacturing mold-based products. It's pretty much just a nuisance that needs to be gotten rid if it is found. I can't see the mold remediation companies in the US having the lobbying power to get the CDC to lie to everyone about the health risks of mold. Because A: they don't have that kind of clout. And B: making mold seem more toxic would actually benefit their business.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I was under the impression that Socrates didn't actually think he knew nothing but rather thought when it came to the totality of knowing something's whole he didn't. The claim seemed to be that you could know parts of the whole but knowing the whole wasn't possible until death where one would transcend the limits of the body and move on elsewhere (which is where I believe his notion of recollection comes into play). 

I think Socrates might claim that for every concept there is a partial knowledge of the concept (this is what he claims 'knowable') and then there is the whole knowledge of the concept. Something about living and being stuck in the body precludes one from knowing every part of a concept thus in terms of knowing something wholly it would be impossible. Take this and apply it to everything and it then seems plausible to accept his argument that knowing anything wholly is impossible thus having complete knowledge is impossible. Partial knowledge, sure. 

Socrates might have claimed to know something about justice and piety but not complete knowledge about justice and piety. Hence his reaction to Euthyphro when he claims to know everything about piety. 

I also think people like to hate on Socrates a lot because he is such a nuisance and causes people a lot of intellectual pain. It's much easier to dismiss someone as a gadfly and move on than to admit they might have a point. That we still discuss someone 3000 years old is testament enough to the merit of their ideas and the processes they went through to establish them. ","1422748902"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Honestly the difference between the 1.5% and 2% for ranged vs. melee is incredibly insignificant.

Let's say GP goes for the full ""crit-plank"" build- IE, Triforce, SS, Hydra, boots and a defensive item. He's got 15 AD from masteries (AD quints and reds) and [21 points in offensive masteries.](http://preseason.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/masteries.html#3ii-rz-xP.14VK_tyae.0.0) At level 18 he'll have 110 base AD, 185 from items, and 29 AD from runes and masteries for a total of 324.

One Q, with a Stattik Shiv proc and a Trinity Force proc, that critically strikes, will deal 220 damage from the Triforce proc (which can not critically strike and therefore is not affected by IE), 250 from the Shiv proc, 300 from the Q base damage, and 810 from the AD scaling for a total of 1580 base damage.

Assuming the Blade Weaving mastery is fully stacked for 3% bonus damage, and the target is under 50% health to proc the Executioner mastery for another 5% bonus, as well as being affected by Havoc for another 3% bonus, this base damage is then increased to 1760 total.

Taking into account the Double-Edged Sword mastery: 1760 damage, if Gangplank were considered Ranged, would be increased by 1.5% to become 1786 damage. Because he's considered melee, however, it's actually increased by 2% to become 1795 damage.

So at level 18, at full build, with every single mastery helping, the ranged vs. melee distinction means GP does a total of 9 extra damage. That's an incredibly insignificant amount.

The real advantage of Double-Edged sword for melee champions is that it doesn't increase your own damage taken by as much. Melee champions have to get up close and personal to get work done, so they have to be naturally tankier or they'll be useless.","1422748903"

"Celiac","t5_2tnai","I went to my primary care doctor, he believes me, saw I was having problems, but I had a neg blood test, so he sent me to a rheumatologist. I tell her my various symptoms, she spends 10 minutes feeling my joints asking if it hurt, after I told her none of them do, she says I need to sleep more. Apparently that causes my face rash, the sores on my legs and arms, and fatigue (even though I sleep 10 hours a night) as well as chronic diarrhea. Then told me to get a sleep study done. Biggest waste of money and time, I waited 3 months for an appointment with her hoping she would at least test me for someone or point me to someone that would help, but no. Instead of her having the fucking balls to tell me she has no idea she just tells me to sleep more.

Doctors in America are only interested in treating someone at a crisis point, not those who have long time problems. My primary was pissed when I called and told him about that appointment as well.

**Budget** - I would not want to pay more than 100€, and Headphones are much more expensive here than in the US! So maybe up to ~$70? I'm flexible, though

**Source** - Laptop, Galaxy Note 3
 
**Isolation** - I actually dislike isolation, it makes me feel etremely uncomfortable when I don't have a clue what's going on (and when my breathing becomes audible). I'm mostly going to listen to music at home and when I'm taking a walk. I'm not saying they should not isolate at all, I just don't want full isolation.

**Headphone Type** - Whatever gives me the best sound! I have no preferences here

**Tonal Balance** - I'm very sorry, but I don't think I understand what this means. I'm a total beginner, really.

**Past Headphones** - Only iPhone and Samsung earphones (and occasionally some cheap $15 earphones)

**Music** - mostly house, some EDM, some other stuff. It's embarassing to say this but I like songs that have a good build up and then a good drop.

**Location** - Germany

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","As for my basis for objectively morality, I would rather not get on a tangent and instead keep everything on topic: the moral value of scripture but as long as this doesn't become the focus of this discussion there's no harm in giving a brief explanation.

I argue that morality cannot exist without conscious beings who are capable of experiencing pleasure and suffering. If there were a being which were conscious but were completely void of emotion, it would know no good or evil. 

I also regard an increase in pleasure as *generally good and an increase in suffering is *generally bad. It does not mean that loading up on a super drug that drowns you in pleasure until you die is the ultimate moral act. This clearly has negative moral consequences on others. Pleasure signifies happiness or contentment, and must be measured in consideration for all beings capable of experiencing pain and pleasure and as also with reference to future consequences. If the super heroin with no side effects leads someone to a solipsistic existence or to self-destruction, clearly this isolated increase in pleasure will bring more suffering in the long term. To the extent that we can improve the experiences of beings which are capable of feeling pain and pleasure, then we are acting morally.

"Tomorrowland","t5_2thj2","So the drug scene is very mixed at Tomorrowland. There are a lot of people just solely drinking there, some people even stay sober the whole time.

On the topic of drugs though, they're not even as close to as strict as Legion makes it out to be. Yes if they see them on you, you won't be allowed to enter the festival, but if you're smart about it it's easy to get away with it.

The entrance to Dreamville they had police there with dogs but the dogs weren't doing anything. They just stood behind the gate with the police and I didn't see them used on anyone. In terms of checking you getting into Dreamville they only are really checking for glass, they didn't do a thorough bag check or pat down as they have way too many people to get through.

Getting through the festival security was easy also, there was 2 out of the 3 days that I didn't even get touched by security, they just let me walk right through without and check. They were checking backpacks if you had them or bags but that was about it, there was really no pat down and it was easy to choose a line that you could see they were going to go easier if you needed to.

Price wise depends on what you're looking for and where you are from, because cheap is a very relative term. They're easy to find especially if you're at dreamville and that would be the better place to look also as you are less likely to get screwed over there. Yes though, in dreamville they were cheap relatively speaking, and it was also some of the best stuff that I've ever came across. Inside the festival it wasn't bad, I knew many people that I met there that had gotten stuff inside and were actually really surprised as to the quality of what they got. Just don't get if from the weird guys that don't look like they belong there just walking through the crowd asking if you want anything. There was one guy I saw there multiple times that was doing that and he is one of the people you should never trust.

On leniency there was a few cases in dreamville where people got kicked out, one of them was when a group of guys had a table full of coke just sitting around and were getting ready to do lines out in the open. Again this is where you have to be smart, just watch for the security walking around and if you see them try to discreetly hide your stuff and you'll be fine.

Next time you see him, get all your stuff and get ready to go. Before you leave, tap him on the shoulder and say, ""Hi, could I talk to you for a minute?"" Get him to step just a little away from his friends if possible. Say, ""Hi, I'm ____. I see you around all the time and I'd love to go out for coffee or something if you're interested. Here's my phone number -- let me know if you'd like to go out sometime."" Then hand him the card and get out of there. That way, no awkward conversation. If he's interested, he'll call.

Like, you want to do something, but you won't do what I asked you to? You really want to do something I DON'T want you to do? Who the hell do you think you are? Why won't you listen to me?

Before my inlaws left, I wanted to give Isaac a bath, but I really didn't want my MIL looming over my shoulder the first time i gave him a bath at home - I dunno, I just wanted to do it with my husband. But I KNEW that it wouldn't go over well if I told her we're giving him a bath and she can't watch/participate. And I didn't know whether it was reasonable for me not to want her there, or if I should just suck it up to be nice, or whatever. And I actually told my husband as much - and finally ended up just not giving him a bath that night. The next morning, when we were talking about them leaving, my MIL said ""The only thing we waned to see that we didn't was a bath"" and I nearly lost my shit. What makes her think she's entitled to see me give him a bath? No one cared to consult me on how I felt about it! GAAAAAH. I dunno. It makes me so angry.

"snowboarding","t5_2qi0t","So you want to go across the hill instead of down the hill on your heelsides huh? 

Try this:

Point your board down the fall line (which is straight down). Allow yourself to gain speed and then gently pressure both your front AND your back heel edges. Do this equally, but gently. This is one of the hardest things to teach. How to go across the hill instead of straight down. 

You'll find that if you point the nose of your board where you want to go, you'll generally end up where you were pointing. However, this will not work well if you lack speed. If you lack the speed, you just go down the hill instead of across. 

Also: Just to cover my basis here, it seems like there are two questions here. 

Preventing of catching your back edge when going toe-side to heel-side:

1. When completing a turn (i.e. you've started your toe-side, it's taken you across and now you've slowed to almost a stop), relax the pressure on your front foot, so don't pressure either toe or heel. Keep your base flat on your front foot, BUT keep your weight there.

2. With your weight still on your front leg, gently pressure your rear heel. This will create a pivot point (where one edge on one side of the board is pressured and the other side of the board is relaxed) and slowly and gently bring your board straight. 

3. From here, go flat/straight for &lt;2 seconds. This will get your board traveling down the fall line so that when you decide to initiate your next turn, you'll be setup for it.

Edit: Lastly, Relax! Keep your knees slightly bent and soft to absorb any rogue bumps in your path! ","1422748919"

Now, I've just been assuming a +4 strength bonus per size increase, and the provided table doesn't display properly on mobile, but all that put together was ~50 damage per round from your familiar alone while full attacking in a flank. Not too shabby!

Even if they didn't, I expect our leaders to be held to a higher standard. I expect the best our society has to offer. That means they don't get any free passes because there's a decade or two between then and now.

We all face consequences for our behavior, both young and old. Leaders, of all people, do not deserve clean slates. It is imperative to society at-large that they do not *get* clean slates.

There is no standard too high for a leader. If they promise miracles, I goddamn well expect miracles. If they present themselves as clean-shaven pillars of morality, I expect they do not have skeletons in their closets.

If a leader would like to be judged as flawed, they must first admit their flaws. So long as they deny their flaws, either by words or by omission, they will be criticized for those flaws.

However, if you have specific goals such as ""form, core stability, and upper body strength"" (for example), those are great reasons to bring to a trainer so they can develop a program for you and help get you going on your way. 

It's also totally and perfectly fine to switch trainers if you're not really jiving with the one you get at first.

VCA own the copyright for all of their students work and also act as Executive Producers for the projects, which can cause problems when you may want to go in one direction and they push you in another. Having gone to a few of their screenings, I have always came out a little disappointed in the level of work they produce as well. Not to say that Swinburne does any better, but I feel that you would be paying more money for a similar course, just to have a bit of paper that says Graduate of VCA.

I also agree with Adio1882, no courses in Australia really give you a direct link to Hollywood. Unless you know someone who can sponsor you over there while you work your way up through the ranks, which would be nearly impossible for a writer/director, or go do a film course over in America, your best bet is to pick a good film course here and make a name for yourself.

"latterdaysaints","t5_2uas2","I found this resolution quite straightforward when I realized it.

I'd prayed and felt the Book of Mormon was true and good, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet. But given the history and schisms in the Church's history, I had no idea if the claim to divine leadership was unique.

So I asked God if this is where he wanted me. And he responded, and responded in the affirmative.

It was pretty reassuring. That's why I'm here. And if and whenever God changes his mind, I'm open to it. But until then, I gotta stick with it.

I believe God is with the Church. I don't believe the unique truth claims (warning: nuanced view), and I'm doing a writeup for that in /r/scripturestudy regarding what I see. Would love it if you could join in Bill, interested in your comments there.

Maybe I'm the crazy one for thinking this way... but why should a person who puts little-to-no money into the game be on an even playing field with a person who buys packs?  You don't roll up to a M:tG event and expect them to hand you a fully optimized, meta-appropriate deck to play with for free - you have to pay money (a lot of money, more often than not) to even have a shot.","1422748929"

Perhaps bring up these concerns with her and suggest couples counselling. It seems like a cliche suggestion, but if you are both open to working on things it can be very beneficial. One of the aspects of therapy that helped my hubby and I a lot was learning about our personality differences and how to compromise on things that our personalities clashed on.

"spikes","t5_2utkz","I'm nowhere near an expert on this deck, but just a few things seem a bit odd to me. 

The first one is that you say Torpor Orb only hits ""Vendilion Clique, Snapcaster Mage, and Siege Rhino."" I think you're forgetting the most important one that it hits, and that's Twin's whole combo (which also happens to run Snapcaster and Clique). I'm not saying that this is reason to add it, but if it were, it would definitely be the biggest reason. It also does slightly help with the Bloom Titan matchup. It doesn't completely shut it off, but they can't put down a Titan and then give it haste or transmute into a Pact of Negation, giving you time to kill it before it does anything.

You have 3 Trinket Mages with only 3 targets to search for. It's going to get awkward drawing one or more of your targets that you want to hit with it, and then not have anything for Trinket Mage to do but be a vanilla 2/2 for 3.

But, I've had massages where there was an incidental brush of the peen (no happy ending), massage right up my thighs until I had a burgeoning erection under the sheet (no happy ending), the masseuse grinding her privates against my arm (no happy ending), or even fully exposing my naked body (no happy ending!)  These are all times when I specifically asked the masseuse if she would give me a happy ending.  I thought a signal had been sent, but no.

Anyway, the fact that legit therapists have never bumped into my peen more than once per massage, one massage out of 20, tells me that it's pretty easy to avoid the penis.  Even for a gargantuan penis like mine (haha).  So I believe that multiple ""accidental"" contacts with the penis is a cue, for you to pick up on or ignore.

The solution I'm offering is protection for the organizations so that match fixing scandals don't spell the end for their business. The damage these players have done to their organizations may scare away any future investors and sponsors that at one point may have been interested in doing business with iBP. Giving these orgs the same tools to deal with these issues that other organizations in larger sports have is a step in the right direction to preventing MOST of the match fixing. Simply because it's still possible to break the law even though it's illegal and it's still possible to get away with it doesn't make my solution invalid. ","1422748943"

If you want to say he should win because of what he did with the defense, especially after what happened before the season even started (and maybe that credit goes to Bowles, we'll see this upcoming season), then I wouldn't argue with that.

also telling that someone is a loser by having poor social skills, bad hygene,being pale etc is even more retarded   
   
there are many rich people who have bad hygene and they get laid as much they want if its something that is an ultimate successful person indicator for you   
   
scandinavian people are pale as hell, do you consider them losers? 50 years ago being tan was a typical thing for farm workers, definitely not for upper class or rich people   
   
poor social skills? there are so many examples of people you read about in books that were shy or weak on social skills, but yeah... such losers, do you realize that many people are born with it?

"Smite","t5_2stl8","I got this from the movie released from china last year so I don't know how accurate this is but it's because the Wukong in Smite is evil Wukong. 

**SPOILERS!**
In the movie The Monkey King, Wukong is still the jokester and likes to cause trouble. He meets Ao Kuang and steals some armor (which changes according to if you're a hero or a villain) with Rúyì Jīn Gū Bàng. Then his lover is murdered along with his friends and he thinks all of heaven is to blame. 

So he get angry and starts to break the heavens. His armor has now changed and fallen apart because he has turned ""evil"". This entire time the joking manners he once had disappear and all he has sights on is murdering the Jade Emperor. 

In smite the model we have is wearing armor but it isn't complete. It is almost exactly how it looked like in the movie when it fell apart on him. Which is why I think Hi-Rez did this on purpose. It would make more sense to have the ""evil"" Wukong be the one murdering all these gods in a war than the trickster who kinda just sits back and watches. But that's just my view on it after watching The Monkey King. :P","1422748954"

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","In the developing world in particular there is a massive issue with falling birth rates. The main issue is that your welfare/pension etc is paid by your children's generation, so if your generation doesn't have enough kids then it will be impossible for your things to get paid.

Also there has never been a successful country which has experienced population decline on a massive level. It is no coincidence that population decline in Europe happened at the same time as the Dark Ages.

In addition our entire monetary system relies on perpetual growth as it is one giant Ponzi scheme. So if the population is in decline then the system will collapse. The issue is that it is uncharted territory, the country with the largest population decline is Japan but their issues have only just begun, so we have no idea what it will be like in the future.

The best solution in my eyes is a stable population, so countries like the UK and the U.S.A are fine as their birthrates are at ~1.9 children per women which means we will have a slightly declining population but not massively so. On the other hand you have countries like Germany and Italy which have ~1.3 children per women, so the next generation in those countries will have massive issues.","1422748954"

I have a Freelancer DUR for doing most of my Exploration (and small trades) alone or with a couple of buddies but I grabbed the Mustang Beta specifically for something zippy that works pure solo.



I personally did not get the Carrack because I don't really think there will be an immediate need for one as the game goes live.

Drivers are pretty simple and I haven't had significant issues. Mint has a great driver manager that makes the installation or changing of drivers trivial. You won't see the very latest ones there, because Mint focuses on stability rather than being cutting-edge. The ones in the Driver Manager are pretty recent though. 

Another great thing about Mint (or Linux in general) is that you don't need anti-virus, and you have 70,000 pieces of free, open-source, peer-reviewed, and auto-updating software at your fingertips though the Software Manager. It's really great. 

Mint inherits from a distribution called Ubuntu, which in turn is compatible with software for Debian. Therefore if you ever need help with something and you find a guide or a piece of software for Ubuntu, it will most likely also apply to Mint. If course you can also get direct live help for Mint itself though the HexChat IRC program, or though the numerous Mint/Linux subreddits. You can also let me know if you need anything. ","1422748961"

$838 divided by 5 days in jail equals $167.60 a day. Right now I owe approx $1500 in fines and probation. By that Judge's generous math I would have to sit for 9 days. I would take that in a heartbeat to be done with all this.

A communist _country_ is impossible because a state can not exist in a communist society, and for a communist society to function properly, it can not have any competing systems alongside it. So unless the whole earth suddenly turns communist overnight it won't happen, probably ever.","1422748967"

First and foremost, you may want to reevaluate your choice of tone when talking to people. I know you like to sum up all those ""lazy hippy liberals"" into one little pocket of ""whiny"", ""uneducated"", ""babies"" but I think your going about your point all wrong.

My mom always said ""You attract more bees with honey than vinegar."" I love my momma and I still hold true to her kind words of wisdom because they've guided me when I find myself in those situations.

Now for me I try to convince people of my views if, in any way, I think they are worthy of my views or I care enough to share them. With that said, I don't think you're actually trying to share your views with others because to be frank, you aren't very convincing. Your belligerent insults and abrasive attitude tells me that you lack the will, or capabilities, of communicating your thoughts effectively and influencing others that have different views than you. In my opinion, I'm glad you have this trait because I don't think your views are worth effectively implementing in the first place. I do hope you walk away from this post somewhat enlightened. Maybe next time you voice your opinion, you'll genuinely try to convince people of your views through intellectual debate instead of benign insults and coy jokes. Maybe you'll actually discuss the topic at hand... and maybe... just maybe... people will listen to you.

There are currently 15 ships in the game, ~12 more are in development, we might see one or more of those come with 1.2.

Some people like to think that the aliens are already in game somewhere, the galaxy is massive and it could takes months or years to find them.

Trading is the easiest way for a new player to make money, yes.

By knowing how to do bounties better you can make 500k an hour easy, sometimes a lot more.

Similar thing with mining, you need to find a good site with high levels of pure metals and you can make some serious credits from it.

And again similar with exploring, some data can be worth 150k+, but it is a lot slower, exploring is more for the adventure anyway.

IMO the game as it is now is just a framework, a rather fun one to be sure, but is missing a lot of key elements that won't be in for at least another month (Wings update) to make it more accessible/fun to more people.","1422748973"

If a player has bad physicals then it can be beneficial to promote them before may. They will start off with a lower overall, but their physicals will grow.

Well, the deal was, originally, Bischoff and Fusient (the group of investors he had built) were in talks for months to buy WCW with then-head-of-Turner programming Brad Siegel. The terms were roughly agreed upon, so much so that Bischoff actually met with WCW talent in January 2001 and announced he had bought the company. Roughly two weeks before the deal was to be finalized (early March 2001), due to the AOL merger, a new head of Turner programming, Jamie Kellner, was brought in. In one of his very first acts as head of Turner programming, he canceled the weekly time slots for Nitro and Thunder (declaring he was not interesting having any wrestling programming on Turner stations, despite Nitro at its worst drawing 2s and 3s, aka ""Raw on a bad night today""). This meant that while Fusient could still purchase the tape library, the trademarks, and what not, they had no distribution to utilize those assets. As such, Fusient backed out, the price of WCW plummeted (with the TNT and TBS time slots the negotiating price was in the $60 million range), and AOL Time Warner had a fire sale, giving WCW to the McMahons for pennies on the dollar. 

Incidentally, Jamie Kellner is also the man responsible for canceling the Animaniacs. In he spirit of Jim Cornette, I hope to one day piss on his grave. ","1422748989"

All of the churches put on catering during the race days and are great places to watch from too. Special mention goes to the church on Sulby straight, ace spot!

Make sure you grab a burger at Capones in downtown Douglas and some Fish and Chips from Peel seafront.

Especially when people are offended by clear and honest mistakes (I've seen it happen) all I can see is a false sense of pride and an active and dense-headed unwillingness to cooperate. Now of course these things may not be completely conscious, but that is because instead of introspectively examining the internal reasons for what they are doing and why they instead believe they have the right to feel offended (which is in itself one of a very stupid concept) and then naturally go on to exercise that ""right"".

"ModernMagic","t5_2xs5t","I've been testing a list similar to OP's online, and I have to disagree with upping the Revs to 2. The biggest hurdle the deck faces is surviving past the first 4, 5 turns. You need all the tools to handle the Lilianas, Rhinos, Goyfs, Scoozes, Geists, Anafenzas, Resto Angels, and whatever other Dog-forsaken 2, 3 drops that the opponent throws at you. Those tools are cheap removal, snares, leaks, and usually by the fourth, fifth turn, some sort of wrath. The deck already performs great late-game since it's packing Esper Charms for CA and top-decks like Grave Titan. If you can't even get to Turn 5 for Rev to generate any sort of CA (and it's not a win-con), then there's no need to pack more than one.

That's my experience with an Esper control list, though, and I'm totally interested in hearing your reasoning for upping the Rev count to 2 :)","1422748994"

I wouldnt want to own one, but it was fun to have a go in every now and then for half an hour and come out sweating. Even when you were not driving it, you are aware its trying to bankrupt you.

Joking aside, it was a great car. My friend permanently had it in the garage as it kept breaking so they were always working on mending this or that, but if you handle it with care it was actually very rewarding to drive and breathtakingly fast... its just that you are always aware that the car has WAY more pace than a mortal can deal with and it gave you zero notice before deciding now is the perfect time to kill you in whaever way takes its fancy today. And even if you got lucky and it decided to let you live in your latest drive, you know that its planning to financially bankrupt you when its parked up in the garage by having something go wrong for no apparent reason.

My point is that I just do not understand where the demand comes from. I never thought there would be people ready to pay that much for an in-game ship. I would understand if the game was F2P with a free access. But I do not understand why players are still okay with it as a full-priced game. And worse, I never thought that there would be that many of these people. I guess that explains why I'm a developer and not in marketing.


I suppose one could construe it as him thinking that you can't earn ships in game, but I honestly doubt that's what he was getting at. I think he's more confused as to why so many people are willing to pay for ships in spite of that. He's wondering why people are not only willing to buy the game, but buy the ships after the fact, since traditionally that sort of demand only exists in F2P games. He's aware of the various stretch goals, problems with CE, and a lot of other things, so I would be surprised if he wasn't aware that you can earn things in game.","1422748999"

"churning","t5_2vrf0","I have Arrival and CSP.  I love the Arrival cards x2.2 points on all purchase, chip+pin for international travel, no Forex fees, $400 signup and the AF is a little less than most.  

I just got the CSP, great bonus of $400.  Extra $50 if you signup an authorized user, mine is my dog!  The increase in spend from 3k to 4k maybe something for you to think about if your spend isn't that much. CSP's strength is being able to transfer points where you can get more value for each point.  That being said i don't like using it when its just x1 for every $1 spent.  It's better when stacked with the Freedom card(no AF) for the x5 quarterly categories up to $1500 spend.  Add in the Chase Ink card to the stack and you can earn some serious points.

I would go with Arrival+ to start as your spend will be low after all that spend and it sounds like you you are going to be spending more on the x1 categories of the CSP than the x2.  I would however stack the Arrival with a no AF card - Chase Freedom and/or the Discover it card for their x5 categories each quarter.  Discovers x5 category this quarter is gas.

That last fight *was* a tough one... even on casual. I had to go back to a previous save so I could take Anders along, for his healing spells.

Prices of principles probably have shifted downwards by about 20% since then.

It ended up being great dope and his prices are definitely on point for the quality(40 dollar bundles of high grade shit) it's just so nice when someone is nice and straight up with you about heroin such a rarity but there are definitely dealers and addicts out there who are just nice people(I know he only wanted a new customer but he definitely didn't need to give me so many free bags)","1422749016"

If you can't but are still sure of his dishonesty, just drop it.

I was sitting in my old room by the door when I was nine, and I felt exactly what you described. There was like a sense of urgency and I just felt really alone, if that makes sense. There was also a weird feeling accompanied with it. This sounds really weird but it was something to do with being nasally. Not specifically a sound or a taste, but it's hard to explain. I often think about this and I would have a recurring dream about this memory very often (I grew out of that a while ago though)

It was like everything became harsher and softer at the same time. It gave me a weird sense of urgency in my gut and yet I kinda hoped it would happen to me more often (I had that one vivid memory of it but I also remember it happening, to a lesser degree in other situations. For example id be sitting at my desk in elementary school). ","1422749021"

Eh not not you in that comment, was talking about mystery there but you did try a scrim against my team and lost 12-2 and I never saw you in the competitive community again.

&gt;TIL I hate Rath and Beef.

Eh rath is a nice guy and doesn't hate people personally mb there, beef may be different, that was just a shit comment on my part. I honestly have no personal grudges against any1 but you. Not even mystery or any other of your admins. All your admins have pissed me off, but you have muted and kicked me for no good reason but personally hating me.

&gt;TIL I hate all pug players.

You do, especially the ones that don't like your play style and are better than you.

&gt;TIL I was last pick for pugs.

Not directed at you, again that was b8 for mystery.

&gt;TIL I kicked a noob.

I specifically remember 3 times where noobs were kicked in order to let a good player in. It may not have been you, you guys all use aliases.

&gt;TIL I want to be the King of Pubs.

You didn't like being scored on in that scrim, I could tell cause you never tried to comeback into the competitive community again. You may not want to be the king of pubs but you didn't like to play against people actually trying.

I really liked you and mystery when I saw you in pubs and I loved playing with you.  For some reason, you didn't like me and just decided you hate me. Not really anyone else just you. I really don't like hating people or holding grudges against people but you are the only person I don't really like because you didn't like me for some reason. I would love to know the reason that you hated me when we first interacted in ts. All I remember is you muting me and never unmuting me. I honestly just don't like what you are doing to the community. Your server is the only full server whenever I or some other people want to play. And I don't like and never had liked going in there and interacting with you guys, because I would just try to play and then you would do something like mute or kick me. I understand that me going ""ns"" or ""nt"" was trolling and may have been mean and too mean for people to handle that was me being a dick. Sorry bout dis but you should make the server private so the people not wanting to follow your rules or don't like to associate with you can actually have people to play with.

Those are human traits, they do not have these. Rhesus Monkeys are not self aware the way an elephant or a human is. 

In this example, they feel the unpleasant shock when the other monkey eats. They see that if they eat, the other monkey feels an unpleasant shock. A human in this example, would attempt to work out a system where they can both share the food and shocks. A monkey doesn't understand this, and instead of working something out, or just eating and getting shocked, both monkeys try to avoid shocking the other and getting shocked themselves. They do this by not eating. 

It shows that they have a very primitive form of empathy, which helps us pinpoint where empathy began to evolve in humans. (Before we split off from the ancestors we share with rhesus monkeys.) By empathy I mean the very base, dictionary definition of it. They can see another monkey reacting to something negatively, and they can tell that they're causing it, so they stop. 

As for the painless shock, they can't break it down and think about it like we can. They don't really have the ability to use logic. In fact, they probably don't realize the other monkey's having the same type of shock.","1422749023"

You're making it out like they're trying to bypass the constitution by using thier constitutional powers.  It doesn't make sense, this whole argument about the constitution is a red herring.  It just sounds like you're trying to give NAFTA a pass at all costs.  The fact is, NAFTA restricts the federal government's ability to regulate the environment within Canadian law.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I know I'll get some downvotes, but here goes. Although he speaks some truth, I think there is still plenty of subversive humor and plenty of ways humor challenges social norms. I don't like ""political correctness"" being this blanket excuse for saying older comedy was good and new comedy isn't as good or is too safe, or that it isn't allowed. 

I can list plenty of comedians and comedies that challenge things about as much as Blazing Saddles. Maybe they aren't as good. Blazing Saddles is a classic. But there is plenty out there. We are just more segmented now. I guarantee you there is some indie comedies that challenge social norms just as much. Probably not nearly as effectively and as funny. Again, it's a classic. 

Not saying these are as good as a Mel Brooks comedy. But Family Guy is on prime time tv. Sarah Silverman is a fairly big comedian. Louie and many other pretty subversive comedians have cable tv shows. They maybe aren't making big Hollywood movies (McFarlan is but he brings it down a little for movies like Ted), but there is plenty out there. 

I guess my point is, there is still a large market for humor that effectively challenges political correctness and social norms, which is what I think he is basically getting at. It looks different now and shows up in different places. But that is more a symptom of the entertainment business than humor itself. ","1422749030"

"ethereum","t5_2zf9m","&gt; However, the fact that a centralized group (in this case a group of core developers who, BTW, I have much more faith in than current political and economic leaders) will have the ability to switch the reward mechanism from PoW to PoS (or something else yet again) as well as make value decisions about which DAOs to reward with new currency issuance kind of takes away from the ideal of a truly decentralized autonomous network.

This (centralization of power to core devs) is always going to be true in the early stages of a DAO (or DAC). You are always free to make a clone of Ethereum that stays with PoW or has some other tweaks to it and compete in the free market. But if you can't get the Ethereum core devs (or other talented outside devs) to work on this clone, it will likely die.

You could use coin issuance to pay for the devs to work on your clone, but the amount you can realistically pay is dependent on the market cap of your coin. If not enough people are willing to buy and hold it, you will crash the value of the coin trying to inflate enough to pay the devs a competitive wage. And since the Ethereum devs could do the same thing with their system, you now have to compete with each other on who can offer the better pay to poach the devs.

To make the system into a truly decentralized autonomous network, it needs to get some network effect and market cap, it needs to have mechanisms to allow the stakeholders to vote on important features of the DAO (hard fork changes, who to pay via coin issuance and how much to pay them to improve the system), and the code needs to be accessible enough so that the stakeholders aren't dependent on a small group of devs who are the only ones who understand the system and can work on it (so that the stakeholders have leverage in the negotiations rather than the founding Ethereum devs by being willing to replace the devs with other outside devs who can quickly get used to the codebase and start improving it). Until then, the reality is that future decisions of the system is based on a balancing act between the will of the stakeholders and the will of the core devs with an initial bias favoring the core devs.","1422749032"

* it's also a great card to use at home.

I'd try to meet the minimum spending requirements with regular spending rather than your upcoming gas expenses though, because although 2.2% is great for a general cashback card it's fairly low for gas: you can get 5% back with the Discover IT card (March 31st, $1500 limit) or Sallie Mae Mastercard (all year long but $250 limit per billing period).

It isn't that.  It's that I've already *had* that discussion.  That's what this thread is about.  You insist that *if* it's a choice, that choice amounts to ""your money or your life"".  I've typed a lot characters giving my reasons for thinking that's not the case.

So you continue to insist that it *is* the case.  I disagree.  I don't want to keep on re-treading the same ground.

All I can say, I guess is ""put on your spacesuit before you go out to fix the satellite or you'll die"" isn't a threat.  It's a fact of nature.  

If you think God should have made a world free of negative consequences, you're welcome (free) to think that.  But then I don't think the purposes for which God *did* make the world could possibly be realized.  It just ***is*** the case that y-result *necessitates* x-state-of-affairs, i.e. the possibility of negative consequences following from making the *wrong* choices.

I should preface what I'm about to say that my previous occupation involved myself, a battlefield, and a hell of a lot of blood.


Coming back from the front was never easy, for various reasons. I had lost friends, I had partial hearing in one ear, I had no formal education outside of my home schooling and my skin was as black as the night is dark.


I never found civilian life comfortable, the routine never as mundane as the military service.  I could never thrive in the suburban life as my friends did, let alone afford a place there.  So when North Korea decided that it would be a good idea to send a few tanks down South, I was giddy with excitement.


Except, I wasn't.


At the end of the first week there at Pusan, a girl was murdered by South Korean soldiers.  They claimed she had defaced their honor by calling them cowards, and that she was a threat to the country.  Various protests from leftist groups cried out for unification and the likes of the era.


But I didn't do it.


I was the only negro in my platoon, with a Caucasian sergeant from Alabama.  When he went missing, I was naturally the suspect.  The MPs came in, ""interviewed"" me which involved a lot more blows to the ribcage then I remembered.  I was taken to a cell and here I am.


But while I was never schooled, I was in way ignorant of the facts.  One of my old friends that had been shot by a sniper in Italy had been a private detective before the war, often looking into affairs of the wealthy, scandals of the famous and corruption in companies.  He had taught me a thing or two about my surroundings.


Even before I left for the country, the sergeant that sent me off, sent off a note with my folder.  A yellow slip which often meant a personal commentary on my character.  


Then, there was the protesters and the journalists from the South Korean newspaper that jeered him when he passed by.


Lastly, there was the Colonel, who notoriously needed a way to rise some of his personal favorites before assuming total command of a counter-attack.  Sergeant Williams was always provocative during meetings, very publically.


I laid down on my prison cell, the damp pillow cold as my head touched it.


It was going to a be a long night. Might even be a long war.  But it wouldn't be a long life, unless I could escape out of the cell to prove my own innocence.


Pulling two small picks from my boots, I raised them up in the air above my head.  I thought to myself, *if I'm going to die, I'm going to deserve it.*","1422749036"

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","A person who knows only French is going to have a shitty time doing anything in, say, British Columbia. Very few people speak French outside of Quebec and even government services outside Quebec require special consideration if a person speaks french. The country is supposed to be bilingual, but really it's only bilingual because it makes us look good, because a person who speaks french is going to be have a hell of a bad time- an even worse time than a person who speaks only english in Quebec with the aforementioned considerations. (Bill 14, I should mention, was never passed and the PQ let it die two years ago, as far as I can read into it).

As far as I can tell, Quebec, being the only province that is largely francophones, is sick of the rest of Canada only paying the ""bilingual"" thing lip service. French Canadians get the short end of the stick by virtue of being part of what is effectively part of the British Commonwealth, and now suddenly them telling us to fuck ourselves makes them the Evil Nazi Language gestapo? Some of them are overzealous, but I honestly cannot blame them. They have to deal with a lot of the same sort of bullshit if they tried to use French in Alberta or British Columbia, and that wouldn't make the news. 

&gt;Transit Authority ticket takers who are mandated NOT to speak English,

The actual statement from the Montreal transit authority says they cannot force their ticket takes to serve customers in any language other than French.

For perspective, do you think a person who speaks only french is going to have a pleasant experience in Vancouver trying to buy a skytrain ticket? Unlikely. And yet I don't recall hearing anything about there being a massive shitshow because a Canadian speaking one of our official languages wasn't able to use public transit effectively when that one language happens to be French. It only seems to be a problem if that person being sleighted happens to speak only English.

At this point we may as well stop pretending and just change our official language to English. English Speakers having a hard time in Quebec is newsworthy, but French-only speakers in the rest of Canada having a hard time is the norm, so obviously there is none of the sort of language parity that is otherwise claimed officially.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","First of all, these essential oils are MLM's. Multi level marketing, or what I like to call ""Mormon level marketing"". Mormons love them because it's something a stay at home mormon mom can do to make a little money on the side and pretend she has a life outside of her kids and the church. 

My TBM sister has a 2 year old daughter that is severely allergic to all kinds of foods. She has the WORST case of eczema I've ever seen. Her entire body is covered from head to toe. One time, this adorable little girl was standing in my parents kitchen and she started crying and I ran over to her and her toes had suddenly cracked open and were bleeding because the eczema was so bad. She has to take bleach baths and has all kinds of steroid ointments for her skin. It's tragic. 

My TBM mom has a friend that is into essential oils and keeps telling my mom that she needs to buy some oils to cure my little niece. After my mom told me she was going to buy them, I said to her ""you know what they call alternative medicine that's been proved to work? MEDICINE!"" 

What I wish I would have said was ""mom, there is only one oil you need. Consecrated oil.""

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Science that I know: The active chemical in weed (THC I think) is an a-GABA antagonist. That basically means it blocks the chemical that transmits signals between brain cells and nerves. 

What this means for your mind is after it reaches your brain, everything slows down and some messages are lost (causing anteriograde amnesia- inability to form new memories). Ethanol (alcohol) does almost exactly the same thing. As does neurontin (a drug for treating moderate pain). 

The thing is, once the THC is cleaned out of your blood by your kidneys, the a-GABA goes back to normal. **Your memory loss is probably more due to stress or damage from other sources (like drinking lots of alcohol or other drugs)**

Although weed is a bad lung irritant and does pretty significant damage to your lungs over the long term.

Tl;dr- weed is probably not the direct cause of memory issues, but other related things such as alcohol and higher COHg levels from the general lifestyle probably caused it.

Or just stress. It's probably stress.

I've been hospitalized, suicidally depressed, two suicide attempts, lots of memory loss, missing weeks of my life, can't hold a job, and have destroyed every relationship I've been in. 

I started getting professional help six months ago. I am on daily doses of anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, and anti-anxieties. I quit drinking and see a councillor and psychiatrist on a regular basis. And I am doing alright. 

My mood was relatively unaffected by the outside world. It didn't matter what my life was like, I would be either extremely elated, or incredibly depressed. 

When I was at a high, I was reckless, unfocused, and impatient. I would go on spending sprees without any concern for bills. I would start huge and impossible projects. Go binge drinking with friends, ending up in unfortunate situations/places. 
I was date raped four times. Drugged twice in a club. Beaten, tied up, and thrown out of a car. I rarely needed to sleep, had all the energy in the world, and had hope for the future. 

When I was depressed it didn't matter how good my life was. A year ago I had an amazing boyfriend I had been seeing for 10 months, my dream job, a great apartment, and a decent savings account. But I wanted to die. I stopped wanting to do anything, lost interest in my activities, didn't go into work, stopped cooking, slept all day. Lost my job, my money, my apartment, and my boyfriend. 

I would be homeless if it wasn't for family. Still don't have a full time job, still can't develop a healthy relationship.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Do you realize how laughably pedantic that comment is? Let's break it down.

&gt;There is no such thing as this concept. Like I said, to lose something or have it be stolen, you must first own it.

I beg to differ. ""Owning"" in this context is not the physical accrual of ""stuff,"" but instead *having* those individuals as paying customers. To steal someone's identity you don't need to have the actual live person and you also don't need to become them -- simply *claiming* that you are the person is identity theft. The same concept applies here -- you are not ""stealing"" the money they could have had, the theft you're committing is stealing their ability to collect that money.

&gt;No you are not.

Yes, you are depriving the owner of profit -- the profit they'd have made off YOU, had you paid like you're supposed to. If you're one of the few that can't afford to spend the money, you shouldn't have the game, because that's the requirement the creators ask for in exchange for their work. It's very simple.

&gt;A pirate is not someone who can be counted in the number of paying customers, so this point is moot.

Yes they are. When you buy a movie ticket, you're not buying the movie. You're buying the permission to see the movie. If you sneak into the theatre and watch the movie without paying, what you're stealing is not the movie, you're stealing the permission. You have experienced what was not rightfully yours to experience for free.

&gt;That's some pretty wildly incorrect bullshit. This kind of erroneous thinking is what leads to DRM in the first place. When you buy a copy of a game, you own that copy of the game. It belongs to you. You're not buying the privilege to play it. That's just silly. Do you also think when you buy a car that you're not actually the owner of the car and that you're just buying the privilege to drive it? Are you starting to see how insanely idiotic that notion is?

Haha, I like how you're refuting your own points now. A car is not the same as an invisible object. If you own a car you own the physical hunk of steel and wheels and glass. You can do whatever you like with those materials. If you own a game, you own the right to experience that game. You can mod it if you like, the same way you can a car. But you're not paying for the game itself -- the game is always property of the developers. It's an intellectual property and not a literal property. That is why pirating games is illegal. I'd argue that having a copy of the game itself is not a crime at all, it's only the act of using that copy that is the crime.

It's the same as any code -- you're not paying for the code, you are paying for the experience the code provides. There are open source programs, and there are programs that require you to pay for the experience.

If games were absolutely free to make, just popped out of thin air, I might take your point seriously, but this is a person's ideas, work and livelihood you are enjoying. It's not air, it doesn't float around in the air for everyone who wants it -- it's media crafted specifically for purchasers.","1422749050"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I'm 18, and I find that a lot of the problem is that there isn't any one real answer to any of the above questions. Depending on there person and age it's completely different.

* ""Unmanly emotions"": it's generally seen as bad to be scared of things, in general (fortunately, I don't really easily get scared). Sadness is also something seen as unmasculine, unless your dog/grandma/etc. died, and then you get a few days before you have to get back to normal—a problem from someone like me who suffers from depression chronically. The length of time you get seems to depend on your group and the situation; guys usually give each other less time than girls, I've found, and older people give you more time to heal than people your age. On the other hand, anger seems to be encouraged, which is disheartening. I agree with /u/crane444 who says that you're expected to be happy and joking and energetic all the time or people tend to shy away from you.

* I don't feel like becoming a man is an important aspect of my life right now. It used to be, but through a lot of self-reflection, I have a good idea who I am, so I don't feel a lot of pressure to ""become a man"" or anything. Also, I feel like a lot of the norms are changing, so it's harder to point to an ideal and say ""be that.""

* I think there are many issues facing young men, all perpetrated by different people. This is where a lot of the conflicting info comes. Guys all expect every other guy to get laid all the time, or he's ""gay."" Girls expect guys to not act like that because it's seen as sleazy, which to a degree is understandable. Guys get told to be chivalrous by adults, but guys our age see it as ""girly,"" or ""gay,"" unless it's your girlfriend. Girls are split, and some see it as nice, some don't care, and some get really pissed off and call you sexist for holding a door open for them—a female friend of mine told me she saw this happen in person. I also think that there's some body image issues that aren't really mentioned. I know plenty of guys that work their asses off because they're terrified they won't fit the action hero ideal of a man's body. I myself, as a skinny dude, have struggled with this—it's okay for people to call guys fat, or ""too skinny"": a girl once told me I was ""so skinny it's gross."" Also, note how much we're told that some behavior is ""girly,"" or ""gay."" This is seen as sexist towards women/homophobic (and rightly so—it is), but nobody cares that they're being told that they're not ""manly"" enough, which is an issue I think we'll have to deal with in the near future.

Don't get me wrong. It's probably easier being a guy, because even in America, it's still pretty sexist, and it's harder. But the issues facing girls are talked about, and people act like guys have no issues and that's BS.

I don't really care if people disagree with me or not... Kids truly can be disgusting. The amount of snot/other random things I ended up with on me even from visits after I moved out, is disgustingly amazing.

And that's not even talking about the nightmares that are possible with poop. Jesus christ I never thought I'd be afraid of a child, but when a 1-2 year old has poop on their hand somehow, it might as well be the same thing as if a demon was coming towards me trying to devour my soul. 

This is all not even mentioning the fairly high chance of getting puke on you.

Babies are like tiny people with alcohol poisoning. As they grow, it's like the alcohol is wearing off and they become cranky from the hangover. The point at which the drunkenness and hangover is gone, is when I don't mind being around kids(about 5 or 6). Way less boogers, no dealing with poop or puke, and they have a decent amount of cognitive ability to be able to talk to. I'm sorry, but babies are pretty disgusting in my opinion. My nephew turned out great, but I'm never going through being around a baby ever again if I can help it.","1422749056"

It's important to understand that an infant's head is very large relative to the birthing canal so that  during birth the head must contort and deform in order to fit through the pelvic outlet. This means a newborn's skull is rarely as pristine as the one illustrated in Gray's. It's important that sutures don't fully ossify until much later in life as the flexibility provided by the connective tissue linking the bones allows for the sort of skull malleability necessary for human birth. 

tl;dr Physiological constraints of the birthing canal leads to some pretty messed up looking skulls immediately following birth and skull may take weeks or so to fully correct itself ","1422749056"

I did a few tests and on occasion it would fire itself from the weight of the battery/atty. I will say that it does perform well in all other aspects and is slightly smaller than my nemesis.  I am sure you'll dig it.

Also, don't be afraid to pick up two or three 100' rolls of different gauges from somewhere like Lightning Vapes (I think they're on amazon). My personal favorite is 26 gauge, but I make a lot of twisted single coils and the higher gauge helps keep the ohms down low. Oh! and one last thing- try wrapping around different diameters to help find what works best for the number of ohms you want. Like, 5 wraps around a 3mm hex key may perform much better than 12 wraps around a sewing needle.","1422749058"

"TwinCities","t5_2r7ar","&gt; What straw man? At no point am I redirecting from my point.

I'm not sure you know what straw man means. It means arguing against a fabricated, blatantly incorrect opponent. For example, when you lectured me about how things are bad in Africa, when I never said they weren't.

&gt; Culture Matters is the title.

This appears to be a book of essays about the role culture may or may not have in economic and other outcomes. It examines the issue from many angles, and does not make any definitive statements one way or another.

&gt; There's better outcome in those countries... and how do you suppose it got that way?

Depends on the country. World history is complex. Here is an important series of events worth considering though:

- Europe in the 1500's had no access to the Silk Road, which connected the very wealthy nations of Asia, The Middle East, and Africa and excluded an impoverished Europe.

- As a result, Europeans began exploring trade routes to Asia over the ocean.

- The eventually led to Columbus's accidental discovery of America.

- Disease wiped out the Native Americans, making the new continents easy to colonize.

- Silver is soon discovered in South America. A lot of silver.

- This vast new resource, among others, shifts the worldwide economic balance away from China and towards Europe.

- Centuries of imperialism and colonialism follow, which went very very poorly for every country that wasn't Europe, and the effects of which are still noticeable today.

&gt; Or do you think that their social values might have had something to do with it?

Something? Could be. Show me the data. Do I think it is the only cause, or even the largest cause as you seem to suggest? Absolutely not. That is an extraordinary claim, with little or no evidence supporting it.

&gt; Being at the top of the HDI is prima facie evidence that their cultural values are better.

Untrue. It measures health, income, and educational outcomes and nowhere does it purport to speak to cultural values.

&gt; How else do you get to that level of progress?

Legislation. Infrastructure. Natural resources. Generational wealth. To name a few possibilities.

&gt; My conclusions are born out of realistic expectations.

They are clearly born out of a strong and disturbing bias. 

&gt;Not everyone is of equal ability or values... 

Arguing against a straw man again. I never said we were.

&gt; [if] so we'd all be millionaires... or equivalently poor.

Untrue. We could all have equal abilities and ""values"" and still see different economic outcomes due to inherited wealth, local circumstances, or simple bad luck.

&gt; Show me evidence or even a reasonable conclusion as to why African countries still linger at the bottom of development that doesn't involve cultural issues. 

I already touched on this, but the impact of colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade was vast. It destroyed local infrastructure, devastated populations, and incentivized bloody rivalries between different ethnic groups (for example, the Hutu and Tutsi peoples).

&gt; At no point have I mistreated anyone I'm the community but I'll definitely voice my frustration with a lack of integration.

You treat others as inherently inferior, so forgive me if I doubt your claim. If you have a problem with the way some Somalis haggle, I suggest you critique that particular behavior, rather than self-righteously denigrating the entire population. ","1422749059"

You should feel beautiful no matter what your size, especially now that you're pregnant.  He should NEVER put you down with insults or emotional abuse.  That's not right at all. :/

A year before I got pregnant this time, I started my weight loss journey.  For ME.  Not for my husband (who has always said I'm beautiful, even after almost 18 years of marriage), not for my kids (they actually asked me why I was going to try and lose weight. I told them that I wasn't comfortable in my own skin anymore, plus I was obese according to the medical field).  I am 5'3.  I ended up losing 40 of my goal weight, and still have about 20 left to go.  My OB knows the history of my weight loss, and has said that I don't have to gain much as I am still considered borderline obese.  I have gained 4 lbs this pregnancy, and I'm 34 weeks tomorrow.

TL;DR:
I'm doing my weight loss for me, not anyone else.  My husband would never think to put me down in any way.  Your husband is an ass. (I'm sorry for saying that).

In other cases why would you build a town around a factory when you can just skip the entire thing and put it up in Central America and have a product that's coming in with no Tariffs and vastly lower costs. 

Corporations don't really value their employees for the simple fact that they don't have to anymore. They aren't limited to a pool of workers in a specific region and they can send the factory anywhere in the world with little to no consequences, where as before there would have been a decent amount of tariffs and other fees related to doing business abroad.

(btw at 12 or so partners for 28 yo is not overly high for a girl these days so OP don't take offence ). Early on in my marriage I was trying to articulate why the majority of men feel this way to my wife. A mans commodity is his commitment and resources (traditionally anyway, that gut feel I guy gets to protect and provide, fix) and woman's commodity for the most part is her sexuality (yes there are other things as well such as companionship etc etc - but for the majority of men this is how they're prioritized). I asked my wife to be honest with herself and to think how shed have felt that when I proposed to her ( ie offer my commitment and resources) that she was aware that she was the 18 girl I've proposed to? I asked her to isolate that feeling and then understand that's how a guy view a girl who has has many, short term partners. For the most part men and women are different to deny that or attempt to social condition it out is futile. Those gut feelings we all get, they are there for a reason you can try to rationalize them away but they will always instinctive appear. ","1422749068"

There's absolutely no reason for gameplay to conflict with story, because it's just a subtle underlay that carries the actual storytelling.

How? Why? I agree that ES's argument wasn't backed up, but yours doesn't seem any more substantiated.

You do cite gameplay being the ""core feature of games"" as the reason, but what does it mean to be the ""core feature"" of any artistic medium? What about ""storytelling"" is ""inherently linear"" in a world where Pulp Fiction is considered a great story? Even ""non-interactive"" hits an odd beat with me because while, yeah, only games are going to have that tangible, physical interactivity where we press buttons and the story changes, some of the best stories I've ever experienced are ones that challenged me to understand the experience. Ones that until I went back to them with a different perspective, I couldn't enjoy on the same level I could now. I feel like a lot of the argument against narratology in games criticism as an equally valid approach to games stems from a belief that good art must be accessible to the point of intuitive, without being shallow, which is certainly a valid interpretation of art theory, but I don't think it is the only one and I don't think it is enough to steamroll over narratological arguments.","1422749070"

 - _Annan tämän kirjeen sinulle._ (give.*_pres.1sg_* this.*_acc_* letter.*_acc_* you.*_all_*) ""I give this letter to you.""

3. **Japanese already breaks many tendencies we think of as rules.** Pronouns usually don't have multiple close synonyms either, but Japanese does it. (Though I concede that some linguists argue that this means that Japanese doesn't have pronouns at all.)

4. **Phonetically they work like suffixes.** The particles don't have their own pitch accent, at least the simplest one- or two-syllable ones. They follow the pitch of the previous word exactly as if they were part of the word itself. For example, in the following examples, pitch 0 is LHHH…, pitch 1 is HLLL…, and pitch 2 is LHLLL…:
 - **hashi0** = [ha˩ ɕi˥] ""edge""
 - **hashi0-ni** = [ha˩ ɕi˥ ni˥] ""at the edge""
 - **hashi1** = [ha˥ ɕi˩] ""chopsticks""
 - **hashi1-ni** = [ha˥ ɕi˩ ni˩] ""at the chopsticks""
 - **hashi2** = [ha˩ ɕi˥] ""bridge""
 - **hashi2-ni** = [ha˩ ɕi˥ ni˩] ""at the bridge""","1422749072"

"startups","t5_2qh26","There a tons of different ways you can do this and there is a pretty big variation in the cost. I'll lay out the options assuming you don't want to give up any equity to get this done. 

The most expensive option tends to be full-stack development companies...these guys will likely quote you $50-$80k which I agree is way too much, but they have multiple developers they need to pay and need to profit on your business. They are reliable at getting a decent app built but you need to keep in mind that once they build it they are off the hook (generally). The app will definitely require maintenance which they may or may not be responsible for, so you could find yourself looking for another developer for that anyway. Here is an example of one: http://boldtech.co/#home

In my opinion, you are better off hiring a freelance developer. I like/have used http://odesk.com/. This option can be risky if you have bad judgement, but their hourly rates are pretty indicative of the quality of their work so you have a guideline. If you find someone good, you can interview them and see if its a fit. You can also negotiate their rate depending on the work. The reason I like this option best is because you deal with just 1 person, and they are essentially on retainer because you can rehire them to use on the same job later on. You can also manage your cost better because the rates are generally hourly and you can monitor progress vs. work time.

This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Any writing on props and costumes had to be reversed, and if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","I think that you have to know yourself, and what's good for you. There are a wide variety of opinions about sexuality in feminism, many of them having valid points, even when those points are diametrically opposed to one another. 


That person might be absolutely right when it comes herself, and even for a lot of other people. But there are plenty of other people for whom casual sex is just fine. Trying to dictate what other peoples' sexuality should be like is a pretty dangerous practice, I think. Raising the point about the oxytocin is fine, and might help someone better understand why casual sex might feel shitty for them, but I suspect that might come dangerously close to slut-shaming. Conversely, arguments that casual sex is The Way to Go (as can sometimes be seen in some aggressively sex-positive circles), can be just as problematic if it contributes to putting pressure on someone to have sex that they might not necessarily want.


Bottom line is that sex is a deeply personal decision for everyone, that is influenced by a huge number of factors, and no one way to approach sex is correct for everyone (with the exception that **all parties should be consenting**). ","1422749079"

Coimbra é de facto uma cidade com potencial. Mas é uma cidade degradada e sub-aproveitada. Logo a primeira coisa que referiu (Sé Velha) está numa zona, que como muitas, está suja e a cair de podre. Para além das casas a cair e graffitis (tags) rascos, com um bocado de sorte até consegues ver as beatas de tabaco pelo chão e vidros de garrafas partidas.   

A baixa está na mesma, cada vês mais às moscas e as lojas velhas estão cada vês mais velhas. Aqueles becos têm tudo menos aspeto de zona recomendável. 

Mas dizes tu, ah isso são becos. Força sobe a Avenida Sá da Bandeira, e vai ver os ""grandes centros comerciais"" como o Golden ou o Avenida... Situados entre casas todas estragadas, e estado também eles tragados, por dentro parecem casas fantasma. Mas vamos para Coimbra B então. Ali na avenida Fernão de Magalhães.

"Frozen","t5_2vpth","&gt;That was great. Aside from Anna and Elsa, Rumpelstiltskin is my favorite part of the show, and until that scene we didn't really get to see a lot of Rumpelstiltskin in full on dark one mode this season, aside from flashbacks I mean.

&gt;Rumpelstiltskin: As luck would have it, dearie, you're my oldest friend.

&gt;That line, the whole scene really was classic Rumpelstiltskin. That's the Rumpelstiltskin I was missing for most of this half season.

Yeah, I loved that too, one of my favorite lines of his, and Hook's face of ""Oh shit..."". Hook is also a favorite of mine, he is a great character IMO. But to be honest I was kind of rooting for Rumple and hated Anna a little bit when she let them know.

&gt;I am kind of excited about Will's story now that you mention it. I loved Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. I heard August was returning, but this is the first I'm hearing about Poseidon. I don't actually mind spoilers like that btw, I just haven't been actively looking for them since the Frozen arc ended.

Oh I'm glad I didn't say anything that could ruin it for you. I haven't looked for them either, but I have OUAT on like in FB so I get the news anyway. The apparition of Poseidon could be extremely interesting as it could lead to a season against the Twelve Olympics or something, could be fun. It also marks the introduction of gods from mythology, so in the future they could introduce Thor, Asgard and else, that could once again be related to Arendelle, which would be great.

As for OUATIW I loved it as well, although the first episodes were boring. I really want to know what happened to Anastasia, she wasn't very well received but I really liked her. I think the actress could've pulled off Elsa as well.

Aside from Arendelle, do you have any legend or story you'd like to see in the show?.

So you've never seen somebody go out for a gimp?  A spike?  A stage spike?  d-tilt at the cliff?  It doesn't sound like you've played Sm4sh or Melee.  

""Edgehogging is a great mechanic""....I can't even.  The mechanic that relies on exploiting the invincibility frames granted by grabbing a cliff is a good one?  

In Sm4sh, the player who's offstage has a clear disadvantage.  Their options are limited by the fact that they have to make it to stage or die.   Once you grab the cliff, the only safe move is to choose your option and take it IMMEDIATELY because certain characters have guaranteed back-airs off of a ledge trump.
All they took away was an easy and cheap kill option that devolved edgeguarding in melee to an almost binary affair. (you pointed it out yourself- either go for the cliff or don't- either way you're fucked) Doesn't sound like a lot of options to me.

Also, I'm curious to know how the average landing lag between Melee and Sm4sh is because I don't think Sm4sh has a major amount compared to previous L-canceled moves.

Your asking for something similar to ""Skyrim Flora Overhaul"" and ""JK's Skyrim"" mods. Unfortunately you cannot add this content to a console even if you have the DLC for the game. Skyrim simply doesn't have the scripts or assets to support this custom content on a console.

When I got to college, I started following the EPL and Bundesliga more and more without regard to any particular teams other than Bayern Munich (I had followed them because of a German friend when I was young). I would come home from class to catch all the Champions League games because they seemed to be the only ones that were on TV. After watching Arsenal play a few times I realized I loved the way they played and after reading into them more, watching videos, etc. I decided Arsenal would be my team.

Since then, I've been watching games with the Triangle Gooners and Camel City Gooners (my flair) when I can make it out to the pub. It seems like everyone I meet there is super friendly and I always have a good time. It just confirms it even more.

It's not specifically about GamerGate, but it gives you a little bit of insight into the chan culture and how it impacts the way GamerGate people act. Simply being annoyed at seeing a someone's outspoken complaint multiple times leads to these kind of remarks out of them.

It also says a lot about why they've doxxed, threatened and harassed people whose opinions they don't like. They're incapable of simply ignoring those opinions, and don't like that other people are capable of doing that, so they pursue abuse tactics as an attempt to make their opinions into something their targets don't ignore.","1422749091"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","The reason I am asking this question is because I have had to deal with women like that in the past and I did it by backing away and just passively agreeing with whatever they were saying. Most black women I have come across were kind and cool to chat with, especially older black women, but I find this to be an issue among younger black women. 

I have been in situations where a woman like that has, out of nowhere, started confrontation with me. One thing that I do find bothersome is that a lot of women who fit the stereotype have no sense of personal space at all. I used to work with this one black girl (quite ugly too) who would grab me and flirt with me when I made it clear that I was not interested. As I have said, women that fit this stereotype also go around looking for confrontation, one day I was standing in line at a restaurant and this girl started shouting racial slurs at me while I was waiting for my food, I was like WTF. It is bothersome and I know most black girls aren't like this but I am asking how to deal with the ones that are.

I don't truly believe that these women believe that they are sabotaging men. The probably with many female perspectives is that they don't have the ability to see someone else's position outside of their own shoes.

They don't understand that if a man is not able to stand on his own two feet, the world will leave him behind. Hence, the high percentage of homeless males in America. Women tend to be taken care of. Not left behind, because they can embrace their femininity. Men cannot do this and succeed in life and women don't understand this.

I believe that the ""backgrounding"" I describe is entirely different than the ""background app refresh"" option. The ""background app refresh"" option does not care whether your app is loaded, backgrounding, or dormant. It will fire up your application whenever to update content. This is independant from the 10 minute backgrounding period most apps have, and is independant from the unlimited backgrounding Facebook has. If you turn that switch off, then you are preventing that application from randomly firing up in the background to refresh content. It will have no impact on the ""backgrounding"" behavior where an app keeps doing things immediately after you close it.

So, no, facebook can not override this. Facebook will stop randomly firing up to refresh content if you turn that off. However, Facebook will continue to have unlimited backgrounding until forcefully killed.","1422749099"

I can only see a figurative or literal interpretation, but nothing in between. However, in times past some like Augustine argued that God created all things in an instant, as he wrote:

&gt;Creation, therefore, did not take place slowly in order that a slow development might be implanted in those things that are slow by nature; nor were the ages established at plodding pace at which they now pass. Time brings about the development of these creatures according to the laws of their numbers, but there was no passage of time when they received these laws at creation. [Augustine. The Literal Meaning of Genesis, translated by John Hammond Taylor (1982), Vol. 1, Book 4, Chapter 33, paragraph 51–52, p. 141, italics in the original. New York: Newman Press.]

Being an AB doesn't require any public displays, so there's no need to worry about repercussions from people who aren't involved. Keep it to yourself and others who will appreciate it and you'll be fine. Diaper dependence is distinct from AB or DL, although it does get a fair amount of attention.

Everyone likes different things and I'm cool with that. I don't understand why some people like wide-open plains, but some do. And that got me to thinking, if you like wide-open plains, then go to Kansas. If you like trees, and hills, and lakes, and nature, then go to Arkansas. If you like the cowboy/farming culture, then go to Texas. If you like deserts and mesas, then go to the pan handle or New Mexico. 

In other words, when you think about it, Oklahoma really does suck because it's where all the authentic parts of the surrounding states bleed together into a crappy approximation of the thing you might actually like. And of course you still have all the crappy parts of the surrounding states in spades.

To be completely fair though, we don't actually know that she *isn't* facing charges in a separate case as well; we only know what the article(s) are telling us, which isn't much.

"jailbreak","t5_2r8c5","This guy again. [Earlier comment I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/2tkbel/raz0r_jailbreak_for_ios_82/cnzti5t):

&gt; As always: when a promised jailbreak comes out of nowhere from an unknown person, it is essential to be skeptical and wait for a person with relevant expertise to verify it, before even paying any attention to it or linking it here.

&gt; A person with legitimate work can super-easily verify that their work is real to a reputable known jailbreaker, without even needing to expose their exploits to the other person.

&gt; Edit: looking at his tweets, they don't make any sense. He claims a lot of things about ""code manipulation"" exploits, which isn't a phrase people use. He lies, such as this tweet from November: [""Wrong info earlier iOS 8.1.1 works with substrate but Sauriks working on a 8.2 substrate as we speak""](https://twitter.com/AndroidSauceSDK/status/535871752820498434) - saurik wasn't. This guy said in November that his jailbreak is [""tethered though :( so every reboot will require a computer boot""](https://twitter.com/AndroidSauceSDK/status/534843793187827713) - but that's not possible unless he has a bootrom exploit, which he didn't even claim he had. This tweet from June is wrong and shows not much understanding of jailbreaking: [""For anyone who didn’t know Limera1n was the only hardware side vuln in any Apple product all other vuln’s are Software side.""](https://twitter.com/AndroidSauceSDK/status/479030491853885440) - there have been several other bootrom exploits for iOS devices. In April he claimed to be [""the head of UI design for Spotify""](https://twitter.com/AndroidSauceSDK/status/454791181395046400) and the next day was [""Patching the ""HeartBleed"" vulnerability in both Crossfader and Spotify servers""](https://twitter.com/AndroidSauceSDK/status/455156050761904128), but UI designers don't patch servers.

&gt; He also claims to work on Crossfader, but the [""about"" page for that app](https://www.crossfader.fm/about/) doesn't mention him.

&gt; Claiming to sell a jailbreak to some mysterious other person is an easy way to not take the blame for the jailbreak never getting released.","1422749105"

Also it's not like Jews just came and declared a state, the UN decided on a partition plan which gave both the Jews and the Arabs a state in the land that was most populated by each faction.

The reason Israel controls all the land it does today is because the Arabs rejected the fair plan and waged a very unsuccessful war against the newly found Israel. 

Your examples are completely unrelated. It seems you think of the Jewish people as an extension of the west, instead of their own people. The Zionist movement wasn't a part of any existing country, it wasn't related to colonialism as the goal wasn't to extend the power of their countries of origin, but to found a safe haven for the Jewish people who were persecuted throughout history.

Probably my favorite character, he's just such a complex monster. We also share a dream for the world. I mean who wouldn't want a world where world peace means that even a king could take an afternoon nap.

[Yoshino Takigawa](http://myanimelist.net/character/43737/Yoshino_Takigawa) - **[Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)**  
One of my favorites, but for a different reason than Ryner. The way he operates made him one of my favorite characters. A stone faced, very kind, intelligent, and strong character. One of my all time favorites.

[Houtarou Oreki](http://myanimelist.net/character/55131/Houtarou_Oreki) - **[Hyouka](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12189/Hyouka)**  
Oreki keeps bouncing back and forth between 2nd and 3rd. We both have lead very grey lives. I had/somewhat still have the same life motto that he declared in the first episode. I'm a bit more flexible that he is but his interactions with others makes him a top contender for favorite.

[Hitagi Senjougahara](http://myanimelist.net/character/22037/Hitagi_Senjougahara) - **[Monogatari Series](http://myanimelist.net/anime/5081/Bakemonogatari)**  
My favorite female character, shes complex, has and acknowledges her own flaws, she has a sharp tongue, she is also very loving when you become precious to her. She's really just a well rounded character overall.

[Aika Fuwa](http://myanimelist.net/character/62581/Aika_Fuwa) - **[Zetsuen no Tempest](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest)**  
Aika is almost a Senjougahara clone (except shes not) it's more like shes reading a script that would be for a Senjougahara clone but the insults she throws aren't too be taken as what she means necessarily. Her character is dynamic even without as much screen time as the rest of the cast. My favorite female character of the show.

[Makise Kurisu](http://myanimelist.net/character/34470/Kurisu_Makise) - **[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate)**  
I think I like tsundere's. Who knew. Kurisu thinks for herself, she is incredibly confident (sometimes to a fault) and her dialogue with other other characters is always interesting.

[Rintarou Okabe](http://myanimelist.net/character/35252/Rintarou_Okabe) - **[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate)**  
Great character, a seemingly mentally challenged man who has simply taken up the role of mad scientist and will not give up on it. Watching his character develop over the series is what made Steins:Gate one of the greatest anime of all time.

[Hachiman Hikigaya](http://myanimelist.net/character/67065/Hachiman_Hikigaya) - **[Yahari](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14813/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru.)**  
Hachiman has a lot in common with Oreki, they are certainly low energy. The difference between them is that Hachiman searches for loneliness while Oreki is comfortable with a certain amount of social activity. I guess in addition to liking tsundere's I like low energy leads.

[Reiko Natsume](http://myanimelist.net/character/13886/Reiko_Natsume) - **[Natsume Yuujinchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou)**  
I was surprised how much I liked Reiko, she's essentaily the reason there is a plot in the series at all yet we see her only a few times. In those few times her dialogue and her way of dealing with the things around her made her a clear choice for one of my favorite characters.

[Takashi Natsume](http://myanimelist.net/character/13783/Takashi_Natsume) - **[Natsume Yuujinchou](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4081/Natsume_Yuujinchou)**  
The grandson of Reiko is my favorite character from a SoL series. There is no series I've felt more relaxed watching than Natsume Yuujinchou (and all of the sequels), and the reason is the MC Takashi. He's a nearly completely average person, he's also very relaxed which almost always aids in putting me at ease.

[Himeko Inaba](http://myanimelist.net/character/40197/Himeko_Inaba) - **[Kokoro Connect](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11887/Kokoro_Connect)**  
Inaba is the only character I've ever named and argued for as a ""best girl"" I've never really cared about these wars but she is undeniably the best female character in Kokoro Connect. She's smart, strong, somewhat selfish, and confident. No other female character in the show can live up to the high standards she set. Overall great character.

"DestructiveReaders","t5_2z15u","Hey Luxanna, thanks for critiquing my work. Here are some thoughts and a few more questions.

So many 'saws,' I'll have to get rid of them. Ack! I guess I still need to work on punctuation and dialogue too. Off to the sidebar I go. Thanks for showing me some of the stuff I'm doing wrong. 

(The guy on the harpsichord is a reference to Tom Lehrer, singing a modified version of ""When you're Old and Gray."" Because I like Tom Lehrer.)

When it comes to Roger and Modges' relationship thus far in the book, both of them are so busy thinking about other things that they don't even realize that they're going to get a one-bed room that night. It leads to a cute and funny scene in the next chapter from Roger's point of view where Modges is going to get the bed and Roger sleeps in the chair. Also, Roger isn't much used to traveling alone or with a single companion, being a young Lord. 

Apples are kind of a gimmick from the previous chapters. Modges ate a couple of apples she picked while on the road with Roger that day and didn't bother to offer him any. I'll make the reference shorter and better.

I haven't really seen more than 2 minutes of Full Metal Alchemist. I just thought it would be fun to have these kinda-magical beings that feed off of the 7 Deadly Sins. Bellicose demons fight, Greed demons gamble and work around money, Lust demons have sex, etc. Their morality isn't affected or compromised by their needs, but they tend to live for centuries (or more?) and have certain little quirks about them making their existence in human society a little awkward. 

Roger's infodump is supposed to be a minor snoozefest, and the interesting information should be Modges' reactions to it, like her 'if he says chosen by the gods I'm gonna puke' line. Having Modges barely pay attention as she scans the room for a card table and thinks about other things might work. I need to get across that the citizens of Roger's principality are very libertine and lax with regards to feudal social hierarchies due to longstanding policies of his family and the fact that gunpowder is now a thing. Those policies have furthermore worked to make his Principality one of the richest, most populated, and most powerful in the area, despite otherwise being a huge target for invaders, (blah blah worldbuilding). I also need to get across that Roger only knows about 30% of the real story regarding his Principality's success. So any thoughts on how to make all of the information I've presented not super-boring and more efficient would be appreciated.

I wanted to tone down Dallia's antics for the first draft to see if her hitting on Roger (and maybe Modges too?) was still obvious to a reader, and to see if I could subtly get across that Modges was trying to keep Dallia quiet about her status and the origin of her silver necklace. I'll put in 1-2 lines about Dallia getting an 'oh crap' moment and freaking out a little when she realizes Modges is threatening her to get her to shut up. I'll ramp up the flirty and sexy stuff Dallia does too, especially when she walks over to Modges and Roger, thanks for pointing that out to me.

So far, ""Swords and Small Gods"" is just a working title, and I'd be happy to hear any suggestions, haha. I initially chose it because of the alliteration and the reference to Pratchett's Small Gods, and the fact that there are indeed swords and small gods in the book.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","I don't really understand exactly what you're asking here. You seem to just think that you don't exactly understand the film, which is a pretty common response. The main vibe that I got from the film was a regretful longing for the more carefree times of the 60s as the more cynical and industrial 70s is taking over. The film had a strong melancholy tone despite the comedy. There was obviously a lot more going on but because I've only seen the movie once I only have a vague intuitive response. And I think thats intentional. This certainly is not a film where a factual explanation will shed any light as to what it's really about. It's more something to just take in and experience. 

As to the recurring theme of sexuality in PTA's films I don't really see it as an indicator of PTA's own sexuality, and I think that would be a pretty shallow interpretation. It's more of a subversive element to interact with the much larger theme of masculinity that PTA often tackles. It can be repressed, such as with Bigfoot, due to the pressure to fit into a certain male archetype, or it can be a sort of insult or threat onto a character's sense of his own masculinity, such as with Berry in Punch Drunk Love. I would keep a closer eye on the general theme of masculinity, as I think a lot of the other elements in these films branch off from it. ","1422749111"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;The $2,500 in grants Bayne received this semester covered less than half of his tuition at ASU. A decade ago, the same amount of aid would have been enough to pay his entire bill

This really needs to be emphasized here. Fifteen years ago, back in 2000, a grant of $2500 was enough to pay the tuition with some money left over for books. 

Ten years ago in 2005, it was enough to help cover a year, and student loans were the money you used to survive on. 

Five years ago in 2010, you needed the grants in combination with loans to pay the tuition. 

Now? Grants and loans won't even cover the tuition in some cases. This is for public schools that were entirely founded to educate the public.

There's a reason every competitive player plays offline almost exclusively and why CRT's are required for competitive play. 

For the majority of players, more than 3-4 frames of input lag (45-60ms ping) is too much, and even then only 2 frames of input lag can even be considered approaching normal play, and that is very uncommon to be able to do. There's a reason why people play different characters and do different things online that they wouldn't do offline, fox in particular is adversely affected by even a couple frames of input lag. Try playing fox on a CRT, then try playing fox online with even a 2 frame buffer and you'll see that its a ways off from ""Normal play"".

We wanted to go to a bar and play Edward forty hands (no idea why really, drunk people have stupid ideas), but the only open bar didn't have fortys obviously, I don't think any bars do but whatever. Thus, the birth of our much beloved game, Edward bud light bottle/can hands man. 

We created a system of ""clues,"" which were really challenges and not clues at all, written on slips of paper and tossed into a hat. The goal was to tape bottles or cans on your hands and perform the challenges with your hands incapacitated in this way. Challenges included ""get a stranger to buy you a drink,"" ""put your underwear on the outside of your pants,"" ""pour a drink on Mark,"" and things like that.

Death Magnetic is the more prominent, because the entire Death Magnetic album was Guitar Hero DLC, but there were also ...And Justice For All songs that made it onto Rock Band and Guitar Hero (One, ...And Justice For All, Blackened, Dyers Eve, and The Shortest Straw, off the top of my head).

Both albums are known for shit production though, which is bizarre after how well-produced Master of Puppets was in *1986.* Death Magnetic had an issue with **LOUDNESS** causing massive amounts of unpleasant distortion and clipping. Its waveform looked less like a wave and more like a brick wall. The Guitar Hero DLC release of Death Magnetic, thanks to being remastered to have separated tracks for gameplay purposes, didn't have that loudness issue, making it much clearer sounding.

Meanwhile, ...And Justice For All had a different issue: poor balance and bad drums. Basically, after Cliff Burton died and they picked up Jason Newsted (also known as Jason Newguy), they basically just left him out of the new album. The bass is mixed so low it's inaudible. If you listen to the song ...And Justice For All on the original album version, I fucking *dare* you to sing along to the bass part. If you listen to that song on the version that was Rock Band 1 DLC, the bass part is loud and clear. I can sing along to it just fine. Also, the bass drums on ...And Justice For All sounded like ass - less ""thump"" and more ""click.""","1422749114"

Who is to say some of those people who didn't get cancer or a related disease from a non-smoking source? Doctors just take the history and then it is ""Oh they were around a smoker, of course that is why they go sick."" They don't go into further proof that IS without a doubt what cause the death.

The reason that bother me so much is they quit investigating what non-smoking related carcinogens exist in our air. Thing that really do cause cancer, but would be unpopular to contribute it to or cause businesses billions if eliminated. The purposely shoot down research into other causes because they can hold onto the safety net of ""smoking cigarettes did it"" meanwhile all of us, smoker or not, get to be bombarded with poisoned air. Non-smoking related lung cancer rates are on the rise while rates of smoking are going down (especially with the new vaping craze that doesn't produce the harmful smoke). 

It is a red herring and I'm getting sick of it. Yes, SOME people do legitimately get cancer from breathing smoke into their lungs, either directly or second-hand. I get it, but that doesn't mean we get to ignore other factors just because that is the easy answer.","1422749116"

In regards to symbols, if you are looking for historic icons, Njord is associated with the processional wagon, as is his son Frey, but this is not exactly a symbol of faith. The reality is that such things weren't common and then only after the arrival of Christianity. The only symbol of faith that we are absolutely sure of is Thor's hammer pendants. Beyond this, we are looking at the possibility of bracteates depicting scenes as possible charms and tokens. If you wanted to, a foot is a mythologically appropriate icon given one myth, so you could go that route. Then again, there's a reason sailors like the anchor as well.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The sun and the solar system formed from a big cloud of dust and gas.  Tiny random variations in the direction and speed of the material in that cloud produced a tiny bias in the slow process of collapsing that cloud into the sun and the planets, and that bias created angular momentum (spin) in the cloud.  As the stuff in that cloud clumped together, it tended to pick up the angular momentum bias and eventually almost everything had the same bias.

Kind of like tossing a ball of pizza dough.  When the chef throws it into the air with a bias (spin), a round ball of dough flattens and becomes a disk.  That's essentially what happened to the solar system as it formed.

Generally speaking, the closer to the sun, the more likely matter was to clump up and orbit in a plane through the sun's equator.  The further away those clumps were, the more ""eccentric"" their orbits in relation to that plane.  Really far out there is stuff basically orbiting the sun in every random inclination and direction.","1422749116"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","I think you're missing the point.  A conservative estimate would put this generation of consoles selling 300 million units.  On top of those extra users you have millions of dollars being invested by the gaming industry in optimising code for 8 CPU cores.  Not only that, but because they're relatively weak cores by x86 standards, they're working hard on moving workloads into the gpu.  This benefits everyone, especially pc gamers.  On top of this it gives amd exposure to more people, it gives momentum to the move towards soc based computing.  Gpus have order of magnitude better computing power,and make no mistake, being able to offload more workloads onto it is massive for commuting.  The libraries, tools, hacks and work flows developed to allow game devs to optimise for amd apus in consoles are invaluable for the industry and worth billions for amd.  Why? Amd humiliates Intel in gpu computing.  Intel is a good 5-10 years behind amd and nvidia.  This takes amd from an also ran to beating Intel again.  We'll see if they get away with anti competitive behaviour again or not.  
If amd are selling console silicon at a loss, which I have doubts about, it's a legitimate strategy to loss lead.  Especially when it doesn't harm your brand value because consoles aren't seen negatively like $100 laptops.  I doubt amd is too heavily losing money on these chips because they are built on a cheap process, with small and well understood pieces in huge numbers.  ","1422749119"

I typically go to Sprouts each Sunday for fruits, veggies, and meat, and to Frys for the rest of my groceries. It's around a 0 mile round trip. I pass the Frys on the way to Sprouts. I could go out of the way and go to Safeway, but I'd rather not, and they are more expensive anyway. 

I actually do do this with chicken breasts as well. However, they can only cook for around 4 hours in the slowcooker, and I'm gone for 9 hours. 

I eat eggs for breakfast each morning. I make grocery lists. I buy in bulk. But I'm also heavily hindered by available time during the week. It's easy for slowcooker recipes to get expensive.

Ultimately, I was hoping for some meal ideas for lunch and dinner, things that are easy and quick or hold well in the fridge. Ways to stretch something out so that it lasts longer. I budget, I'm not poor. But I won't get paid for a month and I don't want to dip into my savings for food.

If they were hanging out on the weekend at like 3 pm, and just kinda chilled for a few hours, and they got hungry so he threw some frozen chicken fingers and fries in the oven, that isn't exactly a romantic gesture.  The guy kind of sounds like a spineless puppy dog, and the fact that he's bringing up his good deeds in a way to shame her on her facebook status so literally everyone who is friends with her can see what a bad person she is for ignoring this guys advances doesn't make them good deeds.  They make them manipulation tactics.  

I went to college with a guy who was always trying to get with a friend of mine, and they would text, and she would say something like I have a headache today, so he would go down to the convenience store and grab her a travel pack size of advil or something.  It was a good deed, except for the fact that he expected something from them, which made them a purchase more than a good deed.  They'd hang out from time to time, but if she would reject his advances, he would bring up the time he brought her advil when she had a headache, which she never asked him to do in the first place.

"YuYuHakusho","t5_2sanu","**Kurama**: A couple reasons. First, I think he'd be useful. Given the right seeds, he could be a source of automatic and nutritious fruits and veggies. Fresh and healthy food is gonna be hard to come by in a zombie apocalypse, so keeping someone with an automatic green thumb around seems advantageous. Second, he is my first choice to repopulate the planet with. Third, who wants Kurama on the opposing team? Not me, certainly. Fourth, he probably knows all the best hidey-holes from his days as a master thief, so it should be easy to find shelter for the night. Fifth, he is super strong, and can probably easily fight off most zombies.

**Mukuro**: First, I don't want her against me. Second, she is arguably the strongest demon in existence. With Kurama's field support, she could probably hold out for days against the hordes of zombies. Even against the stronger zombies, if she is in the right mindset, she could go balls to the wall OP if needed. Third, she has access to fucking regeneration tanks. Kurama gets injured? Into the tank. I get injured? Bam, into the tank. We could probably hold out next to one of her freaking healing tanks until the military arrives, and not have a care in the world.

**Mitsunari Yanagisawa**: One major reason: Mukuro can't hold off the demons? All Yanagisawa has to do is touch her and BOOM! Two Mukuros! Zombie Raizen is attacking us? All he has to do is touch Raizen and then dang--I've got a fucking Raizen on my side.

**Kaito**: I could, at all times, have a force field around me that bent to Kaito's rules. Maybe this would be his no violence territory, or maybe it is a territory where anyone infected by the zombie virus is automatically rendered incapacitated. I also want to assume that since the territory radiates out from Kaito, we could in theory travel with the territory, making it to meeting points and safe houses without incident.

Mountainroseherbs.com sells all kinds of herbs if you start to get intrigued. Also, if your really into exploring the possibilities, try abstaining from ejaculation for as long as possible.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It certainly could be but I would bet against it.  Racism isn't something that you are born with, it's learned.  And regardless of which religion it is, no matter how peaceful and loving it is, there is still an underlying us vs them mentality to it all.  Even the nicest followers of a particular creed still think they are better than those of a different faith.  The two groups might might get along wonderfully day to day but underneath it all there is still the notion that each side thinks they're better than the other.  They will be saved and the other will not.  They are the chosen ones and the others are not.  It isn't hard to move from that sort of my faith is better than your faith mentality to a my race is better than your race type of thinking.  It's partially why back in the days of the civil war and prior to the civil rights movement the bible was used often used to justify treating blacks as a lower class of human.

I would Say that it's Hazard that is the best player in the league, mostly because he has been able to shine within a team of superstars whereas it's easier for Sanchez to shine due to the ""poor form"" (don't downvote me Arsenal fans) of Arsenal's players.

"triathlon","t5_2qhyh","The extent to which a racing bike helps depends entirely on how good of a cyclist you are. If you don't put in the training, you are wasting your money. Yes, a $5000 carbon bike will be faster than something from walmart no matter your fitness, but past a certain point the gains are diminishing. But if you think you'll stick with triathlon it may be worth investing in.

If you're not a completely unexperienced swimmer then yes, you should kick. You don't want to be dragging your legs the whole time and make the swim harder than it has to be. Swim with the same technique as you would when training normally.

Everyone has different race morning meals/rituals. I'll usually eat a clif bar, maybe have some coffee and a banana an hour or so before the start. You don't want to try anything new race morning foodwise. Maybe in your training days leading up to the race, experience with what food works?

You're gonna be nervous race morning and that's okay. If the swim is a mass start, you might be temporarily overwhelmed when you're tuck in a pile of people trying to swim over you. Your heart rate will be through the roof those first 100 meters or so. It's okay. just keep swimming, focus on steady breathing and get it over with.

When exiting the water you'll probably be really out of breath and dizzy. Don't rush through transition, stick to your plan. If you haven't already, practice transitions. Have a mental list and order of what you need to do. Figure out before hand how you want to set up your gear so you know exactly what to do when you get there. 

Most importantly though have fun. It's okay if you accidentally get punched in the face during the swim. It's okay if people pass you on the bike or run. It's okay to pee in your wetsuit. ","1422749126"

Thyroid problems can suppress your metabolism a little - there are hard limits on how much your metabolism can be suppressed though.  Too low and you can't power all the processes required to live.

Maybe get rid of the ""personal belief"" exemptions and require exemptions for religious reasons have to come with documentation also.  You have to show that you actually belong to and support (shown by ongoing attendance at services or participation in associated activities) a religion/church with a stated anti-vax belief system.  While religious affiliation has traditionally been somewhat protected by privacy and association laws, people have been required to ""prove"" or defend their claim of faith when asking for faith-based exemptions to laws.

Just like the Liberals have learned that rabid ideology wins you no friends the Greens also have to realise that people will not buy extreme Greens policies. They could achieve more for their agenda in power or in a coalition than been sidelined with 1 or 2 seats. They dont really have a social democratic vision that they have sold to the Australian population.  If they did this they would win. 

Green power in Germany has not harmed their economy they have been a power house because they believe in evidence based policy and doing the right thing for the people. Unlike our grubby politicians who just work for corrupt special interest groups.  Most Germans dont pay electricity bills and look at us who pay some of the highest electricity prices in the world despite having all the resources to deliver it cheaply.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","If you're asking about the odds of becoming pregnant, according to [this Planned Parenthood infosheet](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-info/birth-control/birth-control-pill), the pill is 99% effective when taken perfectly (i.e. every day at roughly the same time), and 91% effective when taken imperfectly (i.e. missing pills, inconsistent timing. 

What this means is that 1 woman out of 100 who takes the pill perfectly will become pregnant *per year of use*, and 9 out of 100 women who take the pill imperfectly will become pregnant *per year of use*. 

If used perfectly, the odds of becoming pregnant are to my knowledge equally low for the whole cycle. If used imperfectly, and especially if there are pills missed right before or after the placebo week, the chances of getting pregnant probably go up quite a bit.

However - *and this is really important* - the pill **does not protect against STIs**. For issues other than pregnancy, then, it isn't that 'safe' to have unprotected sex even when one is on the pill unless both partners have been tested. Until you *know*, use a condom anyway.","1422749139"

Grieving (which can take some time) is healthy but it's more important to be able to accept what has happened and move forward.  I've been caught in a rut before and a few things that seems to help me move forward is listening to music, exercising out in nature, and star gazing (this really helps me put life into perspective, there is something comforting about knowing how small and insignificant I am in comparison to the unfathomably giant universe).

Sometimes I like to think that the negative things that happen in life give a contrast to the positive. The darker the night always gives way to a brighter sunrise. If you don't know what pain feels like then how could you possibly experience pleasure?

Accept the past and plan for the future but most important, live in the moment.","1422749140"

and research how to install it yourself... very very easy if you feel comfortable taking apart your dash/getting to the back of your stereo. Or buy one at best buy and have them install it. Best, clearest option for sound.

I have one and then on the input I put a Bluetooth receiver so my phone can connect wirelesssly so there isn't an aux cable hanging out in my car... it's great!

Edit: Just an extra piece of info, you will need an antenna adapter for your specific make and model of car (I can help if I'm not bring clear. I've installed 10 of these on my past cars and friends and family's cars). Bonus, they're no more than $5-10.

Edit2: just an fyi, the really basic/laymans workings of this is (and im sure someone here could explain better or more correctly): the equipment taps into the car's antenna. When you switch it on, the equipment blocks out all incoming signal/static for that channel leaving no competing signal for your music (meaning clear delightful tunes) as opposed to fm transmitters that rely on a channel having low enough signal/static that the transmitter overpowers it.","1422749141"

It was pretty much like ""No Healing?  Sure, why not... it can't hurt right?"" and then I noticed that I did a suspiciously high amount of damage when I did a WPS on [Manhandla in the Twilight Map](http://i.imgur.com/gFHVeJe.png).  That was a serious ""what just happened"" moment for me...

So it's me grabbing Pitt while kicking my dog away as I'm trying to manhandle her in the house til they can calm down.

Thankfully both were fine, just some cuts but scared the hell out of me. Next time they saw each other both dogs started licking each others cuts and seemed to be buddy buddy again.

Because she was never exposed to small kids we were real careful when babysitting in case kiddo did something to cheese her off. Sweet temper and anyone showed up she wasn't sure of she got between them and us, but all it would've taken is one time and me being too slow or too far to stop it.

I miss her. Didn't want another dog but I took the runt from her litter since she'd died from complications and I wanted at least one of the pups. Stay in family.

So I'll just give a short version of it.

For the whole day in high school on the last day of school, me and her just started holding hands and doing all sorts of couple things because we were going through something and we needed emotional support.


Then at the end of the day, me, her, and a friend were going to get some ice cream. Before this, we told the friend give us a couple of minutes before we went. We went into the park, more couple things. This time our foreheads were literally TOUCHING. Took more than five minutes. Yes.

Moving on, we got our ice cream (yay!) and I wanted to go to the park again, being the little lovebird I am, so I kinda forced her and begged her into the park. It worked. More couple things.

This time, we sat there for a good hour holding hands and holding each other and with our forehead like glued to each others. I eventually just blurted out ""If I wasn't scared I would kiss you right now"" (wHAT???)

She asked if that meant I liked her
I looked into the distance with a sudden realization of I DO and said yes.

Then she said she was scared so we only did cheek kisses, sure, but heres where the big bad mistake comes into play


I told her
Okay look
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you on the cheek. I promise

UNEXPECTEDLY, SHE ACTUALLY CLOSES HER EYED AND I SHIT BRICKS BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME

ALL THOSE YEARS OF WATCHING ANIME AND ROMANCE SHOWS AND NOW IM IN THE MOMENT


DO I KISS HER ON THE LIPS?

NO.

I literally blurt out ""WHAT DO I DO????!?!?!??""

SHE STARTS LAUGHING HER ASS OFF AND JUST
WE EVENTUALLY KISS VERY NICELY

But even during the kiss
I say ""HOW DO I DO THIS????!??!?""

Everyone makes fun of me to this day.

Ok so the first half of the game is spent setting up racial tension and showcasing the evils of racism. Then half way through the game they run out of reasons for you to shoot people so they decide that an oppressed group rising up against their masters should be equivalent to said masters, and Daisy sends her minions (who idolize you) at you so you have people to shoot. You eventually meet up with her, and in order for the story to prove to you that Daisy is EEEVILLL they have her about to kill a child.

Wow.

Who the fuck cares, you literally killed hundreds of people to get to that point. But apparently this one act is too much for our Disney princess, and she stabs Daisy in the back so the writers can show how strong she is or something.

If it was bigger enough to attract with this force, the problem is that since (micro) black holes are like point masses, the car (and its passengers) would experience significant tidal forces, the center of the car is much more attracted than the outer parts.

""Good"" isn't the word I'd use, but it does work. Not ideal, it will work, but shifting won't be perfect and you could *very* occasionally have the chain drop since most 11 speed dérailleurs have a lighter return than a 10 so the rings are optimized for the chain and dérailleur (also, Shimano 5700/6700/7900 chains were asymmetrical while 5800/6800/9000 chains are bi-directional so again minor differences in the shifting nature of each setup).

"Gender_Critical","t5_32njv","Yep! And that ""moving down"" proves class issue. 

And joining a class later in life doesn't mean you are a full fledged member. Take for instance when a person reared wealthy loses their economic class. 

Did that person lose their good nutrition, health care and education of their early years that aided in the formation of their body and neurophysiology? No! Does that person have the base tools to again receive class mobility at a later date because they have a good base education and a healthy body/brain/connections? YES.

So wealthy people can't get the full experience of poverty like someone born into the shit does. 

And sex is hella more involved than wealth or even race. The consequence of being trapped in a smaller body, conditioned all life to receive a shittier education, more limited choices, oppressive social expectations, to suffer the confines of pregnancy and all the health issues that come with being female, etc, are things trans people will not experience. 

Shouting: ""I AM A WOMAN"" doesnt make real women magically forget all the experiences of her class and the biological consequences being born to that class means. In fact, it comes off insulting to women, because its stripping them yet again of their ability to define themselves and own their own experiences, its the same old revictimization we experienced all our lives, but this time from someone arrograntly claiming to be one of our own, and above us, for we didn't ""choose"" womanhood. Thus telling us we aren't just second class citizens for being born female, but even LOWER than that because we didn't opt for this... Its really a double smack to the face. 

I have a friend born handicapped. I can't imagine sawing off my legs and telling her that she isn't REALLY a cripple because she didn't CHOOSE to be one, and that I will now dictate to her, with my new legless experience, what crippled REALLY means, and demand she see me as equal in class to her and just forget all the abled experiences I had in my earlier life and relent my experience is far greater.

That's straight up narcisisstic shit... ","1422749149"

If someone is cutting or doing heavy drugs its honestly none of your business unless they are constantly bringing it up and are asking for your help. Plus not everyone is seeking help, some people can figure things out on their own and don't need help. This person is probably never going to trust you again with sensitive information. Also, if someone is denying help, the last thing you should do is force help upon them. This will usually cause a backlash and probably harm your friendship.

 [**India–Pakistan relations**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Pakistan%20relations): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Relations between India and Pakistan__ have been complex due to a number of historical and political events. Relations between the two states have been defined by the violent [partition of British India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India) in 1947, the [Kashmir dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_dispute) and the numerous [military conflicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars) fought between the two nations. Consequently, even though the two [South Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia) nations share [linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_language), cultural, geographic, and economic links, their relationship has been plagued by hostility and suspicion.

&gt;After the dissolution of the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) in 1947, two new sovereign nations were formed—the [Union of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_India) and the [Dominion of Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Pakistan). The subsequent partition of the former British India displaced up to 12.5 million people, with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to 1 million.  [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) emerged as a [secular nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_India) with a [Hindu majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_India) population and a large [Muslim minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India) while [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan) was established as an [Islamic republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic) with an overwhelming [Muslim majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Pakistan) population.  

&gt;Soon after their independence, India and Pakistan established diplomatic relations but the violent partition and numerous territorial disputes would overshadow their relationship. Since their independence, the two countries have fought [three major wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts), one [undeclared war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War) and have been involved in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs. The [Kashmir dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_dispute) is the main centre-point of all of these conflicts with the exception of the [Indo-Pakistan War of 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistan_War_of_1971) and [Bangladesh Liberation War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War), which resulted in the secession of [East Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan) (now [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh)).

&gt; Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

"Beekeeping","t5_2qtzm","""The honey bees keep the temperature of their brood nest at just under 100 degrees. Many figure that honey should not be raised above this temperature to preserve many of its good qualities. If honey is heated above that, there is disagreement on what the temperature is at which the helpful enzymes are damaged. It is likely in the 120 to 140 range.

Honey distributed by large distributors and sold in larger stores is usually heated to 180 degrees. This is to dissolve even the smallest crystals that might act as ""seeds"" that promote crystallization. Although crystallization does not harm the honey in any way, it is considered less desirable (in the US but not necessarily abroad). The enzymes that are not visible are sacrificed for the sake of ""good"" looks. "" - http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen06/gen06462.htm

If you want raw honey, start at your local farmer's market. Ask questions. At least around my parts, it's not hard to find raw honey, but finding beekeepers that don't use antibiotics (preventing foul brood) or miticides and don't feed the bees non-honey sugars after robbing them is virtually impossible.","1422749159"

Watches can be a fashion accessory for men (and women) just like any other piece of jewelry; in that regard a watch is actually *more* functional than a simple bracelet or ring because it can do something, even if another tool can also do it.  If you can't afford jewelry, that's fine; but saying jewelry is dumb or you don't see the point of it because you can't afford it fails to acknowledge that it's simply a matter of taste, which flows to fashion, which flows to art.  

As for the average person not needing a watch, there's some argument out there that [seventy percent of American families are unprepared in the event of a natural disaster](http://kxan.com/2014/04/30/preparing-a-plan-to-survive-natural-disasters/).

Then either dump the whole thing into a simmer olive oil, or just dump the figs and let the colors and flavors leech out into the oil.

Yes if I remember correctly it was either in the 'informed sources' or the 'pan up' section of Modern Railways mid-last year. I think it was October.

Well if you could get way more than £3bn for our NHS by simply scraping the 1990 NHS and Community Care Act (£12bn) and up to £5bn by scrapping the 2012 Health and Social Care Act. So no I think that this is a wholly appropriate use of the money.

Certainly not.

Great! We're investing it in something actually useful this time!

You're suffering from something I call the Bastiat Fallacy, or the idea that because I'm opposed to the *means*, that must mean I am opposed to the *ends*. I'm all for education! I just don't think public funding is the most efficient method to provide education, because it's more expensive than other means per unit of outcome.

See this quote to understand the Bastiat Fallacy:

&gt;“Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.” 

&gt;― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law

My mum was really overprotective but she dealt with this problem by always making an effort to get to know the parents of anyone I started to befriend, so by the time we started to ask for sleepovers she already knew whether she was comfortable with me going there or not.","1422749166"
"AskAHeathen","t5_35mri","&gt; The only things that have reality are the actions that we take. Unless we treat frið as a real thing with reality, it has none. Unless we live our lives by the values of frið, it will never be practiced by our children. Our children will end up treating us as we have treated our parents. So, when the bonds become inconvenient and onerous, we will be abandoned by them as we have abandoned our kin. That is the reciprocity we talk about.

You can raise your children and deal with them in accordance with these ideas, though. The notions simply do not function in a situation where only one side is living by them. You cannot impose it onto people who do not care for your worldview or your perspectives, and who do not respect your values. It makes perfect sense to practice it moving *forward.* You cannot enforce it retroactively on those who came before you.

&gt;It is never about what is easy, or what we do when things are good.

I did not imply for a moment that it is. I simply accept the reality that when kin are kidnapping each others' children, there is no frith to strain, it *is entirely absent.* Even you can admit it's an illusion when demonstrated to not exist, and yet you turn around and argue that we have to keep pretending the illusion is real *after it's shown to be a fucking illusion.* Your argument is completely circular.

&gt;In your world, frið is a fair weather friend, to be enjoyed at harvest and abandoned at winter.

False. I simply realize that there are breaking points other than killing each other. But that is a point- that different groups may have different standards- that you chose to ignore in my previous post. I don't like how that's becoming a habit in our exchanges- I at least try to respond to you as fully as possible.

&gt;Your views are almost orthodoxic in that in order to share frið you must believe in it.

I know orthodoxy/orthopraxy is you guys' favorite pair of buzzwords, but it really is as simple as the fact that we're talking about people who don't live in accordance with frith, who would not recognize it if they saw it any more than you or I might recognize the intricacies of any other culture we were blind to. 

&gt; And if you act like frið is such a brittle, unrepairable thing, you're never going to live up to its demands.

It isn't brittle or unrepairable where it exists. Where it doesn't exist, it *isn't anything at all.*","1422749166"

I could care less doesn't really make any logical sense, and you should stick with 'I couldn't care less', but there are some theories that try to justify the use of 'I could care less'.

I could care less basically implies that you have some level of caring, which is probably not what you want to say.

In so far as he describes me, its bossy and ambitious, but also he frequently praises how accommodating I am. Basically it's been my goal for the entire duration of the relationship to affirm and support his happiness, boundaries and comfort.

I'm used to doing my own thing and keeping very low expectations- to the extent that I had to work to realize that I had reasonable expectations that other people might make me happy.

The reason I asked this is because you seem to distinguish between

and

&gt;is changing her position regarding the atheist/theist divide based upon the reliability and confidence of her position.

So a move upward would signify an increase in how much one ""knows"" God exists/doesn't exist, while a move to the left would signify an increase in confidence... in what?

Most people equate ""an increase in confidence and reliability of a position"" with ""an increase in knowledge about that position"", since that's what increased knowledge does. But here you've differentiated between the two. Why?

The problem I have with the axis is that, given how knowledge and belief work (a popular atheist mantra used to be ""knowledge is justified true belief""), it is incoherent for a person to move along one axis without moving along the other, which makes me wonder if there are even two axes to begin with.","1422749168"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Thanks for your answer, I'd like to take some time to answer, if you don't mind. I see where you're coming from, and that has to be really frustrating to deal with, and from your perspective, I can see how it might be flummoxing to see these riders out in the street when a new pathway or trail was built for them.

But I have to ask: Have you actually *ridden* the trails out where you are? I don't mean as a day off, or as a 'eh, I'll take a day out in the fun meandering around town,' I mean, **can you get from where you are living to your place of work by bicycle?** Can you go to the local shopping center with your bike without going on the road, or in a way that is equally fast to riding in the street?

If not, then the trails are *not* doing their job, and you can expect to continue seeing bicyclists on the roadway, because they have no real other choice. See /r/Desirepath for some idea as to where I'm going with this. (It's a subreddit about when you see an engineer built a pathway that's *really* inefficient, and people just make their own shortcuts through vegetation or along a field.) That's *most likely* what the cyclists are doing- they're bypassing the lanes and trails that urban planners put in, because the routes and trails are slower, or don't really go anywhere. (So why use them?) I do a lot of urban planning, and I'm not seeing much of a system, so I would be surprised if you could.

To riders, bikes aren't toys, they're a way to get to work, a way to get to the train station, a way to get to the play, a way to get to the park, a way to visit a friend, something to show up to a party on. **Why would someone take a longer path to get to work?**

I live in Delaware. We spent less than 1% of our transit infrastructure (and only for the past couple years) on bicycles, and it has made a huge difference in how easy it is to take a bike-friendly route to get from A-B. I can now get from my parent's house to my old apartment, 24 miles away, by the following route:

I start out headed left into a cul-de-sac. The end of the cul-de-sac has a pedestrian and bicycle bridge onto another roadway. I then take that road to connect to one that has a bike lane. I ride that bike lane to a nice trail that I ride for about seven miles until I reach the center of Wilmington. I then can either use an abandoned railway and old (abandoned- marked as 'for use for bicycles only') roadway for a couple miles until I get a bike lane. Then I hit another abandoned roadway (the bridge was too narrow and widening was too expensive, so they built a new one next to it). This then turns into a pathway (it's more of a widened, asphalt-paved sidewalk that has signage explaining that it's a bike path as well as a sidewalk) that runs the rest of the way towards my old apartment, where I hop off the elevated and protected pathway that parallels the roadway for the final two miles to my house/apartment (I'm still not sure what to call a house you're renting a room out of...).

anyways, the total mileage? 24 miles, which I can do in a little over an hour and some change if I race along the road, and a lot closer to two hours if I take the most bike-friendly route (but I don't mind, there's a medium option where it's only fifteen minutes more but I'm only on the road for a mile longer). The miles I'm not on a bike path or bike lane or bike...whatever-it-is? That's only rouhgly 6 miles (there are a couple gaps here and there, but the state is working on a humongous solution between the two cities, and that will shrink the gap mileage to as little as 1.5 miles by the time they're done).

Anyways, that's what we accomplished with *1%* of our transit budget. And that's what I'd call 'normal' or 'functional.' We're not some cycling Utopia, either, and driving out here isn't awful most of the time (this past summer was terrible, though. We had to shut down I-495 because of a bridge, shunting local traffic onto local roadways). But two hours of riding for free to visit my parents along a beautiful series of trails, instead of a forty-five minute drive in traffic isn't bad. I don't tax myself when I'm riding, so I really don't show up very sweaty. And Chicago blows us out of the water. So does Philadelphia, St. Louis, New York, D.C., Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Minneapolis/St. Paul, just to name a few. These are blue-collar cities with a good manufacturing working class. My plumber friend has a cargo bike he carries his tools on. My neighbor who is an electrician got into biking. I've sold both my bartenders at my usual dives bikes, which they use to get to/from work when their girlfriend has the car.

And if you can't do that with the pathways that are your area, then you don't have a real bike ""system"" in place (at least, not yet). Give it patience and time- Rome wasn't built in a day. Heck, in Newark, we're still dealing with riders coming up the wrong way in Newark all the time, because we haven't built a protected 2-way lane yet (it's stuck in planning, in the meantime we've only got a 1-way with no return route). Once we do, it won't be a problem anymore.","1422749176"

"CampingandHiking","t5_2qqom","wild camping is rather grey as its all private land, theoretically you need the land owners permission. that being said there are a lot of hostels about with one days walk in between them.

here is the snipt from the national park about wild camping

&gt;Can I camp anywhere in the National Park or do I need permission? 

&gt;A. Although camping should be confined to authorised sites, the Snowdonia National Park Authority accepts that wild camping on un-enclosed fell land, remote from the roads, is generally accepted if undertaken responsibly by small numbers of people. 

&gt;If you wish to camp on un-enclosed fell land you must: 
&gt; seek the permission of the landowner 
&gt; be out of sight of any road or dwelling 
&gt; not leave any litter 
&gt; not light any fires 

&gt;As most of the land suitable for wild camping is not owned by the Snowdonia National Park Authority, we are not therefore in a position to directly permit wild camping. We advice everyone who wishes to go wild camping to have landowners’ consent. 

&gt;It is worth noting also that there is a difference between true wild camping – which should leave no trace and by definition therefore pose no problem – and organised groups visiting popular sites, which can, and does, result in litter, pollution and loss of amenity and sense of place. This is a problem in some very popular “honey pot” areas, particularly in the north of the Park.

"classicalmusic","t5_2qhyq","Beauty is a elusive concept. For me, any art that stirs an emotion or a new thought or a new awareness, whether that emotion or thought or awareness is positive or negative, has succeeded artistically, provided the feeling or thought or awareness evoked is what the artist intended. That accomplishment is, for me, the beauty of art. 


When you compare Bach and Scarlatti to Carter and Birtwistle, you are, I think,  comparing degrees of tonality, and questioning whether atonality can be considered beautiful. Dissonance can be very beautiful if you regard beauty as expressiveness rather than as tonality.


Admittedly I have only watched the first few minutes of the documentary, but I know already that I disagree with the host's assertion. He simply clings to the classical concept of beauty which prevailed until the 20th century and believes that its demise has harmed civilization. I do not agree. In fact, our willingness in the 20th century to add ""ugliness"" or dissonance into the mix, has simply deepened how expressive we can be, particularly in music. As well, the more dissonance we accept, the more remarkable and noticeable classical beauty becomes, by contrast. 

The beautiful and the ugly have always existed. Using them both to express ourselves in any of the arts simply deepens the potential of what we can express through art, now that we use both freely.","1422749179"

Mahabads failure was only the fact that the republic didnt last, however it succeeded in giving the people of Rojhealat hope for the future, hope that it is accomplished, it also guided Qasimlo to realise the faults in rojhealat I.e tribes being one of the resons for kurdistan failure to unite. 

Secondly please explain how the entire revolution disappeared? Without the republic of Mahabad the revolution would never have happened in the first place, after the republic mustafa barzani proceeded to start a revolution in bashur. Ibrahim Ahmad would never have heard of Mustafa barzani if he hadnt participated in the republic of mahabad, the word peshmerga wouldnt even exist without the republic. 

What he says is from a purely Anti-KDPI stance, he sounds like some sort of regionalist, he is disrespecting our first leader Qazi muhammad who gave his life to save his people from the barbaric Iranian army who would have massacred the people of the republic if they had fought. This is what a revolution is, this is how a revolution starts, Komari Mahabad might have been a failed vessel state but it was the symbol of the resistance of kurds, as was its predecessor the republic of Ararat (although Ararats contribution was far greater i.e. a map of kurdistan &amp; the flag of kurdistan)","1422749180"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I suggest making incremental changes so as to not overwhelm yourself and then simply quit. First, cut out sodas and junk food and still eat what you want otherwise. Later, start using some portion control, not going for that second bowl of chili or what have you. Just get up from the table and do something else. Another step would be increasing the amount of the day when you are not eating, shoot for at least 12 hours. For example nothing after dinner until breakfast the next morning.

Look into low carb diets. Fat and protein satisfy your hunger longer than carbs and don't cause an insulin spike. You can lose weight and be healthy eating bacon and eggs for breakfast, and chicken, pork chops and steak with vegetables for other meals.

Exercise moderately, walking and resistance training, it's good for you and will make you feel good.

You can't get fit overnight but you can start make changes that will immediately make a positive impact on your health. I know a guy who lost twelve pounds, and kept it off by simply eliminating soft drinks from his diet.

If you went to Orgrimmar, though, you would suddenly find yourself back in the present, with Vol'jin as Warchief. You go even *further* back in time if you to go to Outland and Northrend.

This isn't something that happens in the official lore, of course: new heroes hoping to prove themselves don't spend time jumping back and forth in time to face down every existential threat Azeroth's faced (other than Caverns of Time and the stuff with WoD).

During the Hoedown, I -- along with a number of other Jets fans -- have pledged to donate $3 x Hutchinson's save percentage at the end of the game. So everytime he makes an amazing save (I'm just assuming there will be multiple), just know that it's triggering a small increase in the donation from our community. A shutout tonight will be worth the $3 plus a $5 standing donation for a shutout.

I've seen irregular scales like this only once.  It was on an adult ball python that survived an extreme thermal burn on her belly.  Over the next few months, the damaged parts healed, but it left her with a ""seam"" of scales going through the middle of her belly and she never did gain weight properly.  I think the skin was left unnaturally tight and that contributed to her spine looking a little prominent.  Other than that, she healed remarkably fast and lived a normal life. 


My other thought is that this is entirely congenital, a birth defect.  The fact that he's very young and that he also has a kinked spine (a birth defect on its own) makes this seem perfectly plausible.

In either case, the snake looks fully healed.  As long as he's eating properly there shouldn't be anything further to worry about.

People hate Brady because he and his wife are self made people, that's odd, or is he an asshole about it?

By the comments I'm leaning towards the patriots I admire their insane consistency as staying in the top wrung of sport for so long is nearly unheard off, but their fans sound painful.

I only added it to give it some interesting qualities. It was a bit plain, and didn't catch the eye as much.

The typeface is actually a default font for Word, so it is all good there.

In a totally unrelated/awesome note, there was also a concept between pirates called [Matelotage] (http://thepirateempire.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/gay-marriage-among-pirates.html). Two male pirates would exchange golden rings, make vows to each other and share all of their plunder/living space. If one of them died, the other would even receive their share of any incoming treasure from the captain.

It usually involved gay sex as well (like most things pirate-y), but it was more of a friends-with-benefits idea. Still, it's nice to think that the concept of same-sex marriage was around at some point in history :D","1422749190"

No, they don't. In actuality, if you know the research, ""failing"" schools are so because they are in low-income communities. Socioeconomic status is linked to student achievement. Getting out of a ""bad"" school has no impact if SES isn't changed.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Playing devil's advocate to your retort: if I'm asking these questions I obviously know how to configure things to make this work.

Secondly I was aware of Snap's offering (although I wasn't aware they did offer a /29, thanks for that).

I will point out I don't actually intend to ask for any support beyond ""if I do this, will it work"".

The reason why I asked these questions is the following:

- I actually want to know if tagged traffic (i.e. high QoS) as per Chorus' scheme is recognized by them. They might drop it unless it's explicitly used for a VoIP service. I will be asking Snap the very same question (and if they're will to tag return traffic for a small fee they're officially the most awesome ISP in NZ to me). I'm (indirectly) paying for 10Mbps/2.5Mbps CIR on top of my 100/50Mbps EIR plan, and I should be able to use it!

- I don't want a dynamic /56 allocation. Prefix Delegation is an annoying kettle of worms that isn't well supported nor defined. I already know Snap ONLY offer dynamic, so one again if NOW can offer me a static /56 allocation that'll make them far more attractive. (If I went with Snap I'd probably keep the SixXS tunnel because despite supporting PD, I have a host that has to be statically assigned (it boots up before the router does because the router is a VM)).

Everytime I find myself wanting fast food, I'm like, ""I could spend $5-$10 on a quick meal that probably is horrible for me...OR...I could save that money and buy a new book or game or something down the road."" And whenever I want to cave in, she puts a stop to it.

Works well enough for me. Sometimes I don't have much of a choice. I'll be out and my blood sugar will drop (Type 1 diabetic), and it'll be close to meal time anyways, so I'll cave and get a burrito or some Subway or something.

I remember about 2 years ago, I went MONTHS without eating ANY fast food what so ever. It was glorious. That was when I managed to get down to 180lbs (29y/o 6'0""). I mean, that wasn't the only factor in my weight loss, but it certainly didn't hurt. Now I'm back up to 220lbs :( Diet is back in check, gym 5 days a week, and I'm trying to get back on the ""no fast food"" wagon.

You want one that you can accessorize totally different every time you wear it.  That is the beauty of a LBD: it can be taken to any (yes ANY) occasion because it holds its own with an unlimited variations of accessories that you can tailor to the event you need it to.  

If I wanted to I can wear a little black dress to a garden party.  All I'd have to do is throw an adorable contrasting crochet beech coverup over it and I'm ready to go.

I can take that same dress and throw on a pair of pumps and a chunky necklace and I am ready for a dinner date.  Throw on a pair of over the knee boots and I'm ready for the club.  

I can put a blazer over it with some conservative kitten heels and walk right into work.

You absolutely cannot do that with the dress you linked.  You can wear that dress to probably two occasions and then beyond that either it won't be appropriate or someone will remember you wore it already.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","That was my main concern going into this game. It works pretty well, each weapon has its own Durability ( ETC: 58/58 ) That number means how many registered hits on enemies you can get in before you have to repair it. In a lot of games after you've used it's weapon to it's max you would have to throw it away or suffer a shittier version of the weapon. But in this game you can repair a weapon a base amount of 3 times. So when the durability reaches say 0/58 you repair it and it goes back to 58/58 and the weapon performs the same at 58/58 as it would at 1/58. Keep in mind after you've used the 3 repairs the weapon won't do anymore damage to enemies. In my experience I would always find a better weapon before I even have to repair a weapon the second time plus you can hold up to 4 in quick select. So yes this game had durability but I think they make it reasonable. Also something to note is that guns don't have durability you just need ammo for it which makes sense.","1422749193"

"zen","t5_2qhmf","&gt; Given that there are any Zen Masters endorsing those ""core teachings, ""Buddhism"" is therefore not relevant in this forum.

Hmm, I see mentioned there the ideas of dhyana, bodhi, nibbana, prajna... which are littered profusely all over the Zen Buddhism writings.  So I'm not sure where you get the idea that the term ""Buddhist"" is irrelevant, considering we are talking about people commonly considered Buddhists. Correct or not, we use words to point to things... disagreeing on what they point to is merely a sideshow.




 &gt;  Since there is no ""Zen Buddhism"" just like there is no ""Zen Christianity"" or ""Zen Hinduism"" or Zen Zoroastrianism"", there is no reason that Buddhism or any other religion is relevant in this forum.

Well society disagrees with you on that first one.

Certainly there is a reason to mention Buddhism, we are talking about a bunch of people who trace themselves back to Shakyamuni, and even use foreign words from his culture (Sanskrit), and even read scriptures from his culture; and themselves profess his philosophy.

They actually read books which explicitly contain that persons teachings. If someone who studies Shakyamuni is not a Buddhist, then isn't the word completely meaningless?

Name one of this tradition who does not use hindu words in their teaching (spoiler: there are none)

In fact one could even go as far as to say it is hard to find a more fitting word in the English language than ""Buddhism"", with regards to expressing that which it reflects (Buddhist philosophies&amp;cultures).

Anyhow that is why I don't rely on playing with definitions of single words, and being able to use different words to describe the same thing, especially if certain people have certain hangups with certain words. It is easy to get distracted playing with words, usually if we find some different words we can overcome differences. Certainly words are ultimately symbols which are meant to point to a shared meaning.

I just try my best to use them as tools, and try to best adapt to whomever I am speaking with so we can communicate as clearly as possible.

&gt; Since this forum is about discussing Zen then if you are looking for traditions you might consider studying Zen. If you scour the Zen lineage texts you'll find that there are a variety of traditions emphasized not by edict but by family custom.

If you can say what studying Zen means, I'll be glad to try it out

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;Dun dun Dun, you are classed as an at risked group due to hereditary and therefore your point is, literally before it even started, irrelevant to this study.

Except I didn't know this until after diagnosed and my father told me. This isn't that unusual either. And without a checkup, many people won't even know that family history matters at all. That's the point in them. Its a general evaluation that checks and educates. And it might very well depend on the personality of the person receiving the checkup and what they do with the information.

I'll give you another example. Its clearly more dangerous, in aggregate, to have a gun in your house than not. This is mostly due to careless storage and having kids in your house. But if you have a safe, no kids, and a credible threat to your life that data might just not apply to you.

And again, in any large population, there will be winners and losers. Some people will be saved by checkups. Some won't. Some will probably die because of them for whatever reason. 

Its like seatbelts. In aggregate they save lives. They are going to kill some non-trivial number of people though. This is just reality. This doesn't mean a policy of wearing them isn't a good idea. But declaring that they always lead to better outcomes just isn't true.

Please read this and understand what I'm saying. I'm not saying the policy shouldn't happen. I'm just pointing out that it will be beneficial to some people. That's just true.

&gt;No it isn't, the whole of god damn science is based on it, your point is ridiculous, that doesn't mean it should be challenged and tested, but currently that research shows that aren't worth the time and money you spend on them, the fact you are denying that is what the science currently presents just proves your own bias, now could it be wrong, maybe, but that isn't what it is showing so far and action should be taken and is being to rectify or at least progress towards methodologies that are known to be effective, rather than stay with ones that at best can be described as inconclusive in their effectiveness.

Again, you are constructing straw men to knock down. I literally didn't say that. I have no dog in this fight. I'm just thinking about it.

&gt;Which you entirely ignored for a large part of your posts and still have continued to do with your anecdotal stories that don't relate this the study.

This has been the point of half of what I've said.

&gt;Having massive economic efficiencies like this is what not only fuels healthcare prices by pumping up demand artificially, but also inflates insurance costs by people spending money on areas that are at best inconclusive in their value, it can easily be argued, not that this paper has, that a better solution would be a more personalised check up towards issue that a person might be at risk at, and if they aren't at risk of anything, then no check up at all if they are following a active lifestyle and healthy diet.

I agree on the cost-cutting aspect.

They should have kept wanting to make them slaves again and go for segregation? After all it was their sincere belief. I mean even God allows slavery so banning slavery was against God to them.

They throw runtime errors (just like a lisp from the 60s) which may be better but doesn't replace a real type system, that's why I put them in roughly the same category.

&gt;Have you ever reached a PHP site with a downed DB? You get a bunch of errors sprinkled on the page most of the time

I guess there are still bad defaults/configurations but this is preventable (and doesn't really have to do with php the language).

Since we're talking about more technical stuff, php is still the easiest (well it used to, it's getting a lot easier for the rest too) and most convenient language to deploy. You can find countless free php hosting service where you just copy your files there and you're done. PHP is not perfect but a lot better than 10 years ago and now it's bearable to write in it.

Both Hitler and Bonaparte had a dual role as military leaders and heads of state. In both cases this colored their military decisions, and often not in a good way. They both made other mistakes as well. The mistake to halt the army before Dunkirk was not made by Hitler, but by his brilliant generals. Hitler only signed the order after consultation with the *Oberkommando der Wehrmacht*. Bonaparte's fateful decision not to pursue the Prussians right after the Battle of Ligny was his fault, and his alone. So were his strict orders to Grouchy *the next day*, when it was too late, to just pursue the Prussians and do nothing else. Which didn't keep him from blaming his generals for the defeat at Waterloo. *""I would have destroyed the enemy at Ligny if the left had done its duty. I would have won at Waterloo if the right hadn't been derelict.""*


Of course, Bonaparte was nevertheless a better corporal than Hitler was. There's hardly any discussion. Yet, they *both* lost in the end. Both, in my opinion, by overestimating their forces and their chances.


&gt;As to whether he was evil, well that's a philosophical question not suited for r/askhistorians.

Tell that to the one who asked the question. OP asked about their reputation. I merely pointed out that saying ""Hitler was evil,"" is not the answer. ","1422749201"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","So basically you apply to be accepted into a training program. Often the requirements for training programs are quite rigorous and competitive. For example you need a certain amount of experience in an area before even applying. Then you are ranked based off your CV (including things such as research, presentations, positions, community involvement etc etc etc), an interview and some references. Places can be highly competitive, for example at one training provider last year I have been involved with the obstetrics and gynaecology program had around 158 applicants for 28 spots. Basically on average for training programs (excluding psychiatry/GP) there is about a 20% acceptance rate. 

Once you are accepted into a training program you then work as a registrar in that area (so an in the field placement) under a fully qualified specialist. Depending on the specialty this can range from 4-7 years generally. You are not simply working though, you are expected to be studying rigorously for multiple exams you will have to pass. Pass rates for these exams can be quite low, in psychiatry their big lot of exams has a pass rate of about 50%. 

Overall a huge amount opf work/stress/competition to get to the level of being a specialist. I am biased in some ways because I am heading down that route, but I think many complaints about doctors charges come from specialist prices, which if people understood how much work and effort it took to get there, they would complain a bit less.

"auslaw","t5_2stjv","To be honest, if this is as technical as you make it out to be then I don't think reading legislation will help overmuch. 

To start with, if you're interested in the 'history' of property law, then a lot of that will be tied up in common law rules which you just won't find in statues. 

Moreover, even if everything were available in one Act or another, it can be really hard for a layperson to make sense of that. Older Acts in particular make use of a significant number of terms and phrases which have specific legal meanings, yet those meanings may not be clear on their face. (Newer legislation is getting better in this regard, thanks to the proliferation of legislative notes and self-contained definitions.)

I know this isn't the answer you're looking for, but the truth is that legal professionals exist for a reason. An expert in the field should be able to give you tailored advice which draws upon his experience of how the system works in practice. It's very difficult to get that sort of broad understanding on your own. (Hell, lawyers seek legal advice on matters outside their areas of expertise!)","1422749203"

Well the simulation would just show Earth forces to not engage like they did yet again this episode. To not rush in and formulate a strategy, or use standard ground engagement tactics.

"vandwellers","t5_2rnwo","A rule of thumb in any structure is to minimize movement of moisture bearing air through the wall and allow the wall to dry to at least one side.  In a van, the wall needs to dry to the inside because it can not dry to the outside through the sheet metal.  Water will condense inside your wall no matter what you do (short of using spray foam urethane insulation).  There is always possibility of leaks from wind driven rain as well at exterior seams.  If you do not allow the condensed moisture to dry, mold will grow if there is anything for the mold to eat (like wood or paper).

So in general you want to use XPS foam sheet (not foil faced polyurethane foam sheet) because it will breath slowly.  You want to create a breathable AIR BARRIER to slow down the exfiltration of moist air through the wall.  You already have one vapor barrier (the sheet metal) on the outside of the wall, so you do not want to add a second vapor barrier on the inside of the wall.  That is asking for trouble.  Here is a good site that explains how vapor barriers work and why people get into trouble by using them.

http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/digests/bsd-106-understanding-vapor-barriers

Sometimes moisture problems take years to develop, so people will claim temporary success with vapor barriers on the inner surface of the wall.

During the meeting where Tyrion is told that Robb stark is dead, Tyrion makes a comment about Joffrey that makes him say **""I am the king!""** To which Tywin responds **""Any man who must say ""I am the King"" is no true king""**  

When Joffrey yells back that Tywin hid at casterly rock during the rebellion, everyone in the room shows fear, not at the king being angry, but at what Tywin might do. He just looks at Joffrey and says **""The king is tired. See him to his chambers""**   Goes a long way to show how Tywin truly felt about him.   

And after the council leaves, and Tyrion is alone with Tywin, Tywin says, to me, the most revealing line.  
Tyrion: **You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper**  
And Tywin responds:
**You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros**.  

In the end, I don't think Tywin cared at all who actually killed him. If he believed the rumors, then this horrible king is an insult to his family and the Lannister name, the ONLY thing Tywin cares about. If he didn't care or believe in the rumors, then this was a bad king without control who could have used the Lannister name, thus causing the family harm again.

She broke up with me before I finished the game and I put it down for a long time. Later I played through it and I had to live through all my bad memories, and on top of that the simple storyline behind Braid is about a guy and his girlfriend that drift apart and later come together again in cute romantic redemption, something I'll never have.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","My dog is exactly the same way. She is 3 y.o. And as a puppy I carefully socialized her to as many dogs as I could. But around 6 months old she started acting aggressively to strange dogs, and by one y.o. I could no longer have her off leash anywhere, period.

Now, She is a sweetheart, incredibly smart and my running/hiking companion. But she is dog aggressive, and cannot be off leash at all to protect other dogs. Pit bulls can be great dogs, but dog aggression is a real and valid thing in the breed.","1422749206"
"Etsy","t5_2qq24","I agree, generally I'm against freebies, but in THIS case it seems great! Especially because you have some kind of idea what the buyer likes. For instance if you order a sweet scent, you can probably guess they will like other sweet scents in your collection.

I've also ordered 5 or 10 pack samples from stores to see what I like. Tea was a perfect example! I wanted to try different flavors but didn't know which one I would like enough to purchase. They had a sample pack where you could select any of their flavors. I liked more than one, so I ended up buying two full-size flavors instead of one!

I would definitely sell a sample pack, and maybe include a free sample as a promotion. Like if a buyer spends $10/20/50 or more (whatever makes sense with your pricing point), or two or more items. Or just do an email promotion like, ""all sales in month of Feburary come with a free tea light of your choice"" or ""next 10 buyers get a free tea light"".

The problem with giving things away for free is that people tend to EXPECT them and then DEMAND free stuff or give you a bad review because they didn't get that free thing. It's crazy how people get so entitled to free stuff! Just make sure you make it clear it is a bonus and not expected with all orders indefinitely. ","1422749206"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","One of our players couldn't make it out the other night. We created the world together using [Microscope](http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/), so we thought we'd spend the time fleshing out our world a bit more. We rolled on the standard 5e treasure generating charts and I was amazed at how quickly story threads and plot hooks started showing up. Mechanically we rolled a plain +1 short sword. We considered re-rolling for something more interesting, but decided to see what would happen if we rolled on a few of the fluff charts. After rolling on its design and background what we got was way more exciting than any  +1 sword I've seen in the past. 

The Ephemeral Blade appears to be a standard, if low quality, iron sword. It's incredibly light, though - a quarter the weight of a regular iron sword. In use the iron flakes and shatters away easily. A filigree pattern slowly emerges in the fractures and cracks until all that remains is a beautiful sabre made out of a delicate lace of iron flakes held together by the merest idea of *sword*.

A mad sorcerer created dozens if not hundreds of weapons in his Windiron Armoury - swords, maces, even crossbow bolts and arrow heads -  prophesying that one of them would be used to mount a successful rebellion against the Mageocracy of Boc, a city state led by a wizard aristocrats. Pieces still pop up across the land, and even a dumb farmer knows that the Mageocracy will pay a good ransom for weirdly light iron weapons so they can be locked away safely. Slightly smarter farmers know that there are other groups who will pay even more, although no one wants to be caught dealing with *them*. 

All that from a +1 Sword! ","1422749206"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","People don't realize that there is not just ONE ""type"" of Pit Bull (American Pit Bull Terrier). They are bred very differently, and while some come from more show lines, others come from performance lines.  Also, Pit Bulls have a very high prey drive, so yes care does need to be taken, but that can be said of most dogs, especially the Terrier breeds.  Also, Pit Bulls are actually very good family dogs BECAUSE of their fighting, ratting and Bull baiting history, NOT despite of it.  I would eagerly take a dog from the performance bred lines over some of the modern watered down dogs because they are only bred to look impressive, and so they are often mixed with other dogs like Presa Canarios, Mastiffs, Dogo Argetinos etc.  This mixing waters down the Pit Bulls natural temperament, and makes them unstable in that regard.  So often when the news reports of a Pit Bull attack, many times it is in fact NOT a real Pit Bull, but a mix.  But ""Pit Bull attack"" sounds so much more riveting than ""mixed dog attack"".  I have had Pit Bulls since I was little and I have NEVER been bitten or seen ANY aggressive traits towards other people in my dogs.  It really boils down to picking a dog that is STILL bred up according to the original standards.  Those are the best dogs in the world.  ","1422749206"

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","I wonder where they got the figure for Antarctica.

The places with the best connection there are the South Pole and the Scott/McMurdo bases. The Argentine bases are fed by their own communications satellite (ARSAT-1) and fiber connection; their Internet speed is probably better than the country's average.

OTOH, the Internet connection at the Chilean antarctic bases is still slow and unreliable; I don't know how connectivity is actually managed, but it seems that it's the same issue faced by the inhabitants of Puerto Williams and other isolated communities in Chile's far south.

The lack of information regarding other Antarctic bases is a reflection of the sheer level of isolation they have with the rest of the world.

As for Chile, well, there is Santiago (which obviously gets the king's share), there are Valparaíso and Arica (the endpoints of the submarine cables linking Chile with the rest of the world), there's a backbone that goes from Arica to Puerto Montt, and there's Patagonia whose isolation level is on par with Chile's antarctic bases. Across the regions connected to the backbone, national Internet access is swift and cheap, but international access has to be routed through either Santiago, Valparaíso or Arica, thus dropping the average to the yellow level.

We certainly need our own telecommunication satellites; so far, we have one research satellite while Argentina has several, and Argentina has ARSAT-1 while we have none. So far, we can only into space through ESO's observatories...

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","From levels 1-30, you'll be playing a conjurer, but at that point you'll want to level up arcanist to 15. This will give you access to the White Mage job, one of the two healing jobs available in FFXIV. Alternatively  if you don't want to do most of your leveling as a healer, level Arcanist to 30 and conjurer to 15 to get the Scholar class.

As the White Mage gets most of his skills from the conjurer class, they have more healing abilities. Scholars, who get many of their abilities from the arcanist class, have a bit more offensive power. I'm not knowledgeable enough to say which one is better, but I've been seeing some of both in both dungeons and raids.

Personally I found healing to be pretty boring in FFXIV, but there is a third healing job coming with the Heavensward expansion, to be released this Spring.

If you're confused at all about leveling different classes, you unlock the ability to play every single class and job once you complete the level 15 main story quest. This means that you don't need to make any alternate characters for other classes, and I highly encourage you to stick with one character throughout your time with FFXIV.

EDIT: Top comment is about how they will never watch it.

Also, it seems they missed the big ""SATIRE"" tag right in the title.

Second comment: 

&gt;The group I hate is probably lying about the overwhelming hostility they face. Here's a list of reasons it's OK for me to be hostile to them. I mean, it's OK, because they've got everyone on their side already. Except me though, that's because I'm fucking smart as hell

I mock this demographic. I'm not hostile to them in such a way that I would censor or harass them.

Third comment: 

&gt;""Any minor political disagreements are put to rest as long as we figure out who is the most oppressed.""
How gators actually believe left-wingers act.

I would eat pineapple but its hard to get where I live and I saw some ladies talking about it being available in capsule form, so I thought I'd give it a go this round.

As for the Maca Root, its another supplement I heard about on here. It is a Peruvian root vegetable that helps with fertility, libido and hormonal balance. I saw a lot of ladies say they loved it, so I thought I'd give that a go too, but apparently you don't see the full effects of it for 2-3 months, and I've only been on it for 6 days. I've gotten DH to take some too, so will see!

I used to take a prenatal but it made me feel gross so I dropped it.

My doc told me that the only thing that actually does anything is 800mcg of folic acid daily, but I learnt everything else on here :-)

I'm also using Pre-Seed. I tried the menstrual cup after BD for one cycle, but nothing happened that cycle and I got paranoid that the menstrual cup was killing the little swimmers so I'm going to give up on that. Although I do hear lots of women use Soft Cups which are different to the cup I was using. I'll give anything a go once though! :-)

That's why I only mentioned NiP guys with very long and impressive careers. They all have massive fanbases and great relationships with their sponsors.

&gt; If you really want to work in the industry, it's a much safer bet to have a degree of, for example, Computer Science, Graphic Designer or Event organizing.

If I'm being completely honest, it can be debated that 10 years of esports experience is more valuable than an administration degree. I mean of course it's way more convenient just to get a degree in the related field, but having the experience these guys have is easily superior to a bachelors in management.

Of course ex-progamers aren't going to get engineering jobs requiring a CS degree, but getting consulting jobs to organize events or representing your company are very viable career directions.

Getting a degree is a great way to get your career started, but experience and networking is what differentiates you from the masses.

To the first question. It is not that I cant get one. It is more that I dont get one from physical interaction or from just thinking about a girl, or any other human. I think this is really hard to understand so to answer your question: No I hadnt but the feeling was good. It was a feeling of joy and happiness. :)

I am a virgin yes. She definetly does know that, or atleast I really think she does. Well we had met today and luckily she said to me that she wasnt up to force me to it. And that I should do it when I am feeling right about it. Your advice is good, I will try it next time. Thank you :)

Well I can have sex, since I can get a Boner so its not just about that, its more that I never think about that when I am with her. I am not interested in that. This may sounds weird but it is as it is. Sometimes, I wish it wouldnt be like it. It would make things so much easier. I just dont want to lie to her. That I like it when I dont really like it. Since I never had sex, I might like it if it happends... Something I was just thinking about while reading your comment. Certainly I dont have much hope for that, but surely hope last the longest.

I can't speak for the US but in a lot of EU countries (all that i know of) match fixing is illegal and a punishable offence. It doesn't matter if it's in the rules of the tournament or not, it's the law.

If CSGL is illegal or not is irrelevant and a whole other question. The fact remains that these players fixed matches for monetary gain and you can absolutely go to prison for that.

The reason that you can get away with it in other sports is because it's much harder to prove. These cases were easy to prove since the players pretty much did nothing to hide what they were doing. (i.e. betting via CSGL and their own steam-accounts or accounts that could be linked to theirs).

Anyway, going to guess here that she was probably flushing maxi pads down the toilet or something, or maybe just had a rather large poop, and has probably never been told a) don't flush your girlie shit down the toilet and b) what a damn plunger is and to use one *immediately*, not keep using the clogged toilet making it worse.

Once she got it good and nasty she was probably too embarrassed to ask anybody for help and has been doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to try and justify to herself what she's doing and how she's going to get out of it before somebody finds out (too late!)

I'll bet $1 this is a case of spoiled rich kid syndrome, not disgusting slob. If she was just plain nasty the mess would be WAY worse.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","I didnt say it wasnt a facet its just not nearly a sole reason or that simple (in fact maybe if you took less time trying to be snarky and actually read what i said it helped his popularity, maybe i wasnt being clear enough though to be fair). Obviously Lin boosted the asian market and got a lot of fan support from them, he still has a bunch of lin only fans, but im saying the average nba fan only cared what heroic feats he was accomplishing and how unlikely it is that lin would be the one doing it. It wasnt just the asians talking about him thats for sure and to have the majority public pay attention to an asian minority isnt as simple as a great white hope in jimmer or somthing. Yes Asian minority played a role i am not who op was responding too i never said it didnt.

&gt;Yeah, he was underdog because he was an Asian kid who played at Harvard &amp; was a devout Christian with a clean cut personality who barely was in the league.

I agree with this but like i was saying I dont really see why its being said like linsanity therfore doesnt count.

Darren collision came from the most winningest college basketball teams and was drafted 21st you really expected the same level of hype and suprise that he was playing well? That is expected of him. if you switch there race lin still would of had a bigger break out (though maybe not necessarily to the same level).

your comparing the nfl and nba i hope you realize different circumstances. people dont freak out about single game performances in the nfl its not nearly as personal and is more team achievement orientated. I think its kind of odd you chose some of the most popular athletes of their time to dispute that an underdog story gets you popularity. Your also comparing two very different situations one like tom brady being a draft day surprise and another being a flash in the pan experience. Having draft day surprises happen all the time for example isaiah thomas or chandler parsons ect. He didnt have the same opening games where we had never heard of him and then his first 5 games were some of the best games anyone had played in that stretch. Brady's first few starter were unspectacular.


just becasue lin got a small documentary is a big insult to you? it was a very unique story that captivated audiences, they were trying to capitalize on the moment. tom bardy has a movie. Kurt also, and an autobiography. 
 
lin got a lot of hype becasue he was an underrated no name who seemingly had no chance that only played because those coach had no other pg to choose from and then in his first game shocked people at his ability and then went on to have a stretch of amazing games and game winners completing the transformation from was a kid that didnt even go to a big time basketball school and didnt even get drafted that nobody had ever heard of to single handedly winning games for the biggest basketball franchise. Maybe if you could find me a basketball example of that happening because i certainly never seen anything like that happen. Hes also a likable person and that obviously helped people be a fan of him and wanted to see him succeed.

if you think lin was only popular because he was asian and had nothing to do with his play and underdog story... idk what to tell YOU man... you care far to much about race. it has far more to do with shock and awe in my opinion (and in my case).

its just ignorant and disrespectful to say linsanity only happened because he was being marketted towards asian instead of his actual play. He was a much bigger flash in the pan then those you mentioned. 

the main difference between hassan and lin is that hes a big guy when post players never get the popularity as wings and hes not winning games or in nearly as big of a market. Whiteside is also a 7 footer who the general public figures would be good at basketball. linsanty wouldnt of happened if it wasnt in New York and not winning games and not putting up highlight game winners. The way Asian plays in is that its even more surprising that a race with the stereotype of being unathletic makes it even more suprsing not necessarily that he was marketed towards asians and thats what made him popular.","1422749216"

Once that is done, you can release the nation and play it by yourself. An event which details Israel would pop up, giving you basic mobilization and immigration benefits. Also Palestine would gain your land as core after independence.

Either conquest the area with the British, Americans, or Germans. Or play as the Ottomans. Starting from the Civil War timeline is a faster way to do it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It all depends, really. Documentaries tend to focus on a small slice of trans individuals, and not the newer wave of people who are discovering their identities are okay thanks to the spread of information via the internet. Online, it depends on the forum as some are very much into encouraging SRS and some are more open to people who don't wish to have it. It varies from person to person. My condition is not common and my tests are being used for research to help others. I've only met one other person, a trans male who is not getting SRS, who has an identical set of circumstances surrounding being hormonally intersex. 

Most of the trans community is accepting of people with any genitalia attached, really, but the slice that's presented to the public is carefully constructed to shove the majority who don't get SRS out of the light to not ""weird people out"" more than they have to. I saw a presentation on how the images of the LGBT community are often not what the majority is. For example, on TV you see white, young, upper-class cis gay males all the time. But in reality they're a minority in the larger spectrum of things. It's an image designed to be palatable to others.

""You're trans, therefore you must want to get SRS"" is one of those things, to normalise and reinforce the whole ""women must have vaginas, men must have penises"" lie.","1422749219"

"BitcoinMarkets","t5_2wwh3","I'm close to my capitulation point I think.  I sold 15% of my holdings I bought at ~400 today at 225.  Unfortunately I'm a little overextended in bitcoin right now and between jobs.  I don't want to have to sell my stocks or other investments.

The problem is I think bitcoin is in a death spiral (which I'm sure someday it will recover from, but not anytime soon).  I want to try to bandwagon short this bitch, but I feel like the whale defenders will come and guard 200 for a while (or maybe just a day or two, who knows)

I'm about to be zhoutonged on my position for the first time.  I had a good run trading for a novice though.  Increased my holdings by 30% or so.  Now if we hit 205 its all on the line.  Granted I only trade with 30% of my holdings, but losing 75% of that to a margin call will suck.  I find it almost inevitable at this point that I will get margin called, but I hold out for the possibility of a run back up to 250.

The reality is, any pump at this point wouldn't be followed into by the bulls.  Most people who are still bullish after all this time are close to broke.  The saying markets will remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent is true.  

I have been a bitcoin bull since the April bubble of '13, unfortunately my cost basis is about a bit above 400.  I did well riding ""the dips"" I would buy on a flash crash, and sell a few back when it recovered.  Despite the constant decline, I felt that we could hold ground at some point.  The reality is, no whale is in a hurry to pick up coins.  They see no reason for the price do rise anytime soon, and quite frankly neither do I.  They would just as soon wait another 60-70$ price drift downwards.  This prolonged bear trend has shaken the faith in bitcoin for a lot of people.  I thought $500 was a comfortable price, not too crazy, not too bullish.  Then $300 looked like a solid floor, until it wasn't.  $200 has already shown that it wasn't shit, and that the trip back down that way seems inevitable.

Take this as a bullish signal if you must.  Also, don't feel sorry for me too much, this isn't ""my life is over because I invested too much in bitcoin"" sort of post.  I tried to limit myself to 25% of my net worth, which still, is entirely too high, and may have broke that rule by a few %, but I'm still O.K.  I learned a lot from this experience, a few key things being:

1)  The trend is your friend.
2)  Trust your gut not your greed.
3)  Don't get emotionally involved with your investments.  

And of course the ""Don't forget to set a fucking stop loss because you are ""actively trading"".  Always set a stop loss the second your place a long/short limit or otherwise.

"wow","t5_2qio8","It's really not that easy in comparison to other rotations. Generally, all DPS rotations are easy in WoW. This is more about how Enhancement Shamans have roughly 35 abilities. They do have a rotation with ~9 abilities in it though, which is still more than other classes. It's all about prioritizing your moves properly.  ","1422749220"

I can never keep track of when I get paid or when my wife gets paid, we just know our monthly income and set a budget based on that income.  I have no interest in when I'm getting paid, I'm just interested in getting paid.  

Your statement of ""spend until it's gone"" is extremely concerning to me.  You do not budget based on that, you are not telling your money where to go, your money just goes where it wants.  Poor planning.  

Budgeting is making a plan before you get paid.  Running your finances into the ground is spending your money after you happen to have it.","1422749220"

So in college I hooked up with this, um, average looking girl who didn't even go to school there (she was visiting friends). I was drunk, horny, and she didn't need much convincing to get down. 

Fast forward about another month and I'm at my parents place, drunk again and in need of a hookup. Text her up, convince her to come stay at my place after she gets done at work. The kicker - she lives 2 hrs away. One way. 

Wake up the next day and was like ""wtf did I do?"" Do I call her and tell her nevermind? Nope, I went out with friends and let her drive all the way up to my house where I wasn't home. We even drove by once while she was waiting for me on the porch and laughed as we went by.

She eventually got the hint and drove the 2 hrs back home, calling me in the middle of the night crying her eyes out over what I had done. 

The positive ending - she's happily married with kids and I'm a lonely 30 year old with nothing to my name. Although I'm a better person now and would never do something like that again I still feel as if I have some karmic debt to pay from that. ","1422749220"

I would like an 8 team SPL though. I also wanna see like a fan vote All Star Team. Like you vote for top 2 players in each position and they go to China to represent their team and country vs China. It'd be cool to see Team NA vs Team EU vs Team China and Team LatAm.

"mgmt","t5_2rjdi","I'm sure like most this is the album that got us into MGMT, and like most I was introduced to MGMT by Kids, Time to Pretend, or Electric Feel.  Those three songs really are great and I had easily over played them and got sick of them after a while but now a days I'll listen to them and they invoke such a nostalgic feeling, as does the whole album.

That being said my favorite song on the album is easily Of Moons, Birds, and Monsters.  The first time I heard that song live my mind was melted, it was just perfect.  Second favorite MGMT song after Siberian Breaks.

I love Oracular because it is one of those albums I can just throw on and it takes me back to a place when I was just discovering the wonderful world of psychedelics and expanding my musical horizon.

I love every song but if I had to put it into a list of my favorite songs from the album I think they would be in the following order:

1. Of Moons, Birds, and Monsters

2. Electric Feel

3. The Handshake

4. Kids

5. Time to Pretend

6. Weekend Wars

7. The Youth

8. Pieces of What

9. Future Reflections

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My boyfriend's mom wouldn't allow her sons to get their driver's license at 16 unless they became an eagle scout. If they didn't, they had to wait until 18.

When my boyfriend graduated high school, his parents said they would only help him pay for school if he went to community college for the first 2 years. He enrolled in community college, and then they told him they weren't actually going to help him at all, he had to get a full time job. He ended up getting 4 jobs (working a total of 50 or so hours per week), while going to school and paying for it entirely on his dime. They wouldn't cosign any school loans and wouldn't give their information for him to sign up for FAFSA.

A friend of his had lost his license, so my boyfriend was giving his friend rides to work and home. After a while, he decides to spend the night at his friend's most nights because it shaved an extra hour of driving out of his day. His parents didn't like that, and told him he had to be home 6 out of 7 days of the week or he would be kicked out. He tried to tell them about the hour of time and amount of gas and money he saved, but they wouldn't hear it and kicked him out.

If you lived at my boyfriend's parents after you turned 18, you were expected to pay rent. Only his youngest brother decided to continue living at home after turning 18, and he started paying rent. Then, if their mom noticed his room was messy, she would take his game system and refuse to give it back until he cleaned his room. In my state, that is *illegal*.

Persia wiping out the Ottomans was surprising.  Karma for taking Constantinople so early?  Germany's demise...not as surprising.  It's obvious that Europe is going to be a giant orgy of wars and backstabbing.

China vs Mongolia was interesting.  The Mongol army just watched as Old Sarai got pummeled; the bonus provided by just a single Great General was probably enough to scare off Mongolia's AI.

"GraphicDesign","t5_2qrct","I've been studying graphic design for a few semesters at a public university. The thing that has struck me as the most useful isn't necessarily the skills or theories I'm learning, but the resources that are available to hone those skills.

You can do tutorials or watch lynda.com videos all day, but having a professor and peers to sit down with and get information and feedback from is huge. Not to mention the alumni and professional networks most colleges have that can help you with networking, internships, jobs, etc.

I think the comparison you mentioned is flawed because whether you learn about history from a book or from a college course, you don't *do* history; you're not learning to become a historian from those courses. You can easily learn about and practice graphic design without a formal education in the field, and many people successfully do, but there's a difference between learning how to do graphic design and how to be a graphic designer, if that makes sense.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm a genetic anomaly in my family...  Both of my parents have horrifyingly bad vision (both have vision at around 20/1300).  Both of my parents are tone deaf, and incapable of singing or playing any instruments.  Neither of my parents were ever really that good of athletes.  Neither have any artistic skills, or academic skills above the average.

I on the other hand, have 20/10 vision, I have perfect pitch (and have been a member of multiple all state choirs, and the all eastern choir), I play wicked jazz piano too.  I swam in high school, the only sport I ever really played, and was a sectional and state champion, barely missing all-American by .13 seconds.  Upon getting to college, I have excelled academically in a way neither of my parents ever could (I'm a mathematical physics major, my mother is a college drop out).  

I am essentially good at everything my parents aren't good at.... Except for one thing...

I suffer from a bipolar disorder, which for much of my life was absolutely debilitating, ultimately leading to a suicide attempt a few years ago.  I've made a lot of progress, but it's something that came out of the blue, no past history in my family.  It's made it difficult for me to maintain relationships of any kind.

So I don't know if I really won a lottery of some kind, I've done a lot of cool things, and I'm capable of a lot... But I would much prefer to be ""average"" (our whatever that means) in exchange for a normal brain...  One where I don't have to be taking 12 pills a day just to keep myself stable....

TL;DR:  on the surface it might look like I ""won the jackpot"" but there's a lot more to it than just the ""physical traits"" you can see.  (As cliche as that may sound haha)","1422749233"

In essence, the conflict that exists today is no more than an old-style struggle for power, once again presented to mankind in semireligious trappings. The difference is that, this time, the development of atomic power has imbued the struggle with a ghostly character; for both parties know and admit that, should the quarrel deteriorate into actual war, mankind is doomed. Despite this knowledge, statesmen in responsible positions on both sides continue to employ the well-known technique of seeking to intimidate and demoralize the opponent by marshaling superior military strength. They do so even though such a policy entails the risk of war and doom. Not one statesman in a position of responsibility has dared to pursue the only course that holds out any promise of peace, the course of supranational security, since for a statesman to follow such a course would be tantamount to political suicide.

"CCW","t5_2s4mc","It kind of is wording and it is all but impossible to enforce. IIRC, the law stated that you must report it stolen whenever you notice it's stolen within a ""reasonable amount of time."" So if it is stolen and used in a crime, you could say you didn't realize it was missing. Any responsible person would report that it's stolen even if it wasn't a law, and proving that you knew it was taken is hard to prove. So, I guess it is somewhat pointless. The only harm I see in that law is that it sets precedents for municipalities to create their own laws.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Personal experience. It's the cumulative view of anyone who has been around it.

What is your sample size? How much time have you spent each in publicly run and privately run prisons?

&gt;But it's hard to imagine that anyone would believe privatization was better when they replace cartons of milk with a cup of variably diluted ""breakfast drink.""

That has become common in publicly owned prisons as well. It is cheaper and less trouble, since a fair number of people have problems with lactose.

&gt;You couldn't get this subject and make that statement. A guards wages are not an issue

Then you are not really concerned about people profiting from incarceration, just the idea of private ownership. Don't think for a moment that correction officer's unions are any less likely to lobby for more prisons.

&gt;Parole? Probation? Who decides when you're released?

The same state board that makes the decisions for publicly run prisons.

&gt;What about an undocumented 'alien'?

It really should be an enhancement to any criminal charge that the crime was committed while the perpetrator was in the US illegally. Right now, there is no real difference.

&gt;I feel like even though that just scratches the surface of the repercussions, it's already beating a dead horse because making your freedom worth less $$ to someone is fundamentally unethical.

Turning custody over to a public agency, knowing the objective data shows those prisoners will get worse treatment at higher cost is more ethical how?","1422749236"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt; VW and automobiles?

German tank designs were manufactured by many different German automotive companies; such as Mercedes-Benz and Porsche. Ferdinand and Royal Tiger models were largely assembled and manufactured by Porsche, or at least parts of them (such as the Tiger II's turret) and Mercedes manufactured many engines. Opel and Volkswagen manufactured for the most part much lighter vehicles. 

Now, German superiority in Armored vehicles was truly only achieved in 1944, and even then it was not across the board. [Even in 1944, German tank formations](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2qu7tq/how_would_tank_units_be_organized_during_the/) continued to have a higher concentration of obsolescent or equal equipment to their enemies; with many Panzer regiments retaining a battalion of Panzer IVs. Very few units, such as Panzer Brigades, were ever equipped in their entirety with Panthers. Up until the development of the Panther (""Panzer Mk.V"" until 1944) the German line armored regiments were predominantly armed with Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs.  This [was discussed recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2sjhq9/why_were_us_tanks_m4_sherman_still_inferior_to/) by several flairs, including our resident armor expert /u/TheHIV123. An undeniably [strong case](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2lsr1y/what_was_the_predominant_cause_of_the_french/) can be made, especially early war, to the German's more mature armored doctrine, and tactical superiority in armored command.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Definitely comes with the reading. Reading helps you notice how words are used in context, so they'll pop up in your head faster. 

----

Trawling through a thesaurus out of game can also help; look at words you already know and think about how they come across differently. Think of the kinds of words that your character likes to use. Think of different ways to express amazement, for example, and say them to yourself in what you imagine to be the appropriate voice:

**""Oh my god!""** immediately suggests a youthful sort of thrill and happy excitement, maybe some squealing too. 

**""Incredible""**, to me, suggests that the gears in your brain are churning. You're trying to make sense of something when you say that word. Of course, you could also say it in another way that's just as slack-jawed as ""OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD"".

**""Spectacular""** is even further removed. I see it like a pleased critic, smiling at a good work. It's spectacular, yes, like you knew it would be, but that doesn't subtract from it.

Try playing on themes like that. Getting a feel for word feel is great for picking just the right thing to say, and picking out commonly used turns of phrase like your characters' expressions of amazement can instantly create a bit of personality.","1422749237"

Anyway.

Depression is hard to describe. I was exhausted all the time. I was pretty consistently suicidal. I spent a lot of time thinking about how much things sucked and how much I didn't really want to do anything. It felt kinda like I had been living my life for so long with all these filters and screens to protect me against how awful it really is, things like misguided optimism and misplaced happiness, and now all that armor had fallen away and I was touching life directly, unprotected, and finding that it disliked me almost as much as I disliked it.

"tifu","t5_2to41","Reminds me of a time I accidentally ingested a cookie with almond flour (allergic to tree nuts) in it. Although I generally have relatively minor reactions and are able to purge and get on with my way. Unfortunately I was drinking and didn't realize until things started getting real.

Some context: I am living in my first house ever the the week before classes begin junior year of undergrad. My FB is leaving for her school tomorrow so we had to horizontal tango one last time beforehand. Thursday night house party seemed like the only way to go.

The party starts rolling and friends who haven't been seen for months are arriving and things are going swimmingly. My FB and I were having a good time playing drinking games. Then she walks in. A girl I had known for sometime that had recently thrown up on my penis mid-blowjob, absolutely terrifying experience, would not recommend. But we were still cool cus she was hot. She happened to work at a bakery and brought a cornucopia of specialty cookies, brownies etc. When prompted on whether I would like a cookie or not of course I obliged; unbeknownst to me that this was the turning point in the night.

A half hour rolls by and it begins, the dry mouth and itchy throat are finally noticed. Oh shit, could it be that delicious morsel given to me by BJV (blowjob vomiter)? I ask and her face sinks before she confirms to me that they in fact were made with almond flour. BJV  apologizes and I realize that I've never had to death with an anaphylactic reaction while intoxicated and without Benadryl and/or epipen. Fuck.

FB is now slightly concerned but still trying. And I'm a little more worried about this escalation of swelling around my cheeks and eyes. Not to mention some itchiness as the hives sporadically set in. Some drunk person handed me a children's bottle of Benadryl. Drunk me decides, ""hey, why not drink the whole fucking bottle, it's for children I ain't no pussy"". How very wrong was I.

I felt like I was chained to the dining room chair I was sitting in. Unable to move but not yet drooling all over myself. FB is hamboned at this point and BJV is still apologizing as my eyes swell up even more and I develop a high pitched squeak in my voice.

Then the call came, my prospect, the female I wanted to date during the school year and had been seeing the whole summer. I had high hopes, she turned out to be a dirty sloot, but whatever. She was coming over. It didn't matter that I had a girl there or that I said no, she was coming over and I was going to console her and forget about FB. 

We meet outside and she walks up to me with a look of horror. She said I looked and sounded like a chipmunk. To which my friends thoroughly enjoyed and began to call their anaphylactic, dying friend ""Alvin"". I had to go inside to sit down as I felt like I was in a hyperbolic time chamber.

FB beelines and we begin to conversate, she grabs me by the shirt and walks me to my room; that is the last thing I remember from that fateful night.

Takeaways from the night:

FB was not impregnated. Thank sweet baby Jesus.

Prospect showed her true colors and tried to bang all my friends. They did not, bros before hoes.

BJV and I eventually had a thing and she never again tried to murder me

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","No - feminism isn't about equality. The name ""feminism"" itself is gender-specific therefore it cannot promote egalitarian or gender-equal views. The cornerstone arguments for feminism don't even exist (for example, there is no ""wage gap"" there is no ""rape culture (1 in 5 statistic is bullshit). The thing that really makes me angry about feminism is how people tout voting rights for women as the banister for feminism's usefulness in culture, as it was arguably the start of classical feminism as we know it. Yet they completely ignore the fact that not only could women not vote, most men couldn't either. In order to vote in most states you had to be white and own at least 50 acres of land, which gave most men the same voting rights as a housewife. It wasn't until after the civil war that voting laws started changing state by state. At the exact same time that women were gaining the right to vote, most men were also gaining the right to vote. 

The fact that feminism completely discounts this and tries to make it out as if women were oppressed by some kind of patriarchal structure allowing men to vote, demonstrates how utterly one-sided and unequal they really are, especially considering most men had the exact same struggles at the exact same time.

&gt; And even when we try to explain how its use is wrong and offensive?

When you're explaining to someone else, that implies the listener isn't aware of the word's history.  They may not really understand how important it is we be sensitive to it.  What better way to drive this point home than to make a big show of censoring the word,  thereby teaching by example.

http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1921&amp;context=articles

&gt;Abstract:

&gt;Most group creativity research is premised on the assumption that creativity is unleashed by removing normative constraints. As work organizations become increasingly diverse in terms of gender, however, this assumption needs to be reconsidered since mixed-sex interactions carry a high risk of offense. Departing from
the assumption that normative constraints necessarily stifle creativity, we develop a theoretical perspective in which creativity in mixed-sex groups is enhanced by imposing a norm to be politically correct (PC)—a norm that sets clear expectations for how men and women should interact with one another. **We present evidence from two group experiments showing that the PC norm promotes rather than suppresses members’ free expression of ideas** by reducing the uncertainty they experience in mixed-sex work groups. These results highlight a paradoxical consequence of the PC norm: A term that has been used to undermine  expectations to censor offensive language as a threat to free speech actually provides a normative foundation upon which
demographically heterogeneous work groups can freely exchange creative ideas.

This study challenges every one of my preconceptions.  

I'm going to have to dig into the research on this topic further.","1422749248"

"nintendo","t5_2qhnk","See, in general we have Mario Kart, Mario Party, the actual Mario games, and all the Mario Sports titles. The only place you get to play as all the Nintendo characters is Smash, and I'd like to see a place where they all get along a little better. Having a fun race is slightly different from kicking the everloving crap out each other.

I agree that there are some characters that would have to be really redesigned to fit, but they've been happy to redesign characters for Smash, so I think they could make it work. I also think certain characters would just fit better than other. You may not end up with Marth in a Nintendo Kart, but Kirby and Pikachu could fit just fine.

I like the Mario setting and characters, but personally I think it might be getting a little old. Rosalina's the only character in the roster that was created within the last decade. I think they need to do something to shake things up, pretty soon.","1422749249"

She started asking about what school district my kids were in, and when I said ""oh, we don't have kids yet"", she just got this weird look on her face and then went on, saying ""well I'd imagine that even if your kids are in X school district now you'd want to live in this neighborhood because blah blah boring facts Y school district is so much better now.""

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Let me rephrase in that it won't be a 100% original direction. Obviously they were setting things up. (R+L=J) Beyond season 1 of the show D&amp;D seem to deviate from the books more and more. Season 5 they're taking larger liberties.

In terms of thinking about season 6 and 7 while writing 5 and lack of time to invent their own story... That's what TV writers do. They have time. This is their craft. And it looks like for Season 5, they're doing it. I'm saying I wouldn't be surprised if D&amp;D come out and say their endgame is different/original from GRRM's. Both stories start at the same place, but maybe the show takes a different path. Those differences have ripple effects and we end up with seasons 6/7 not much resembling what's in store for TWOW/ADOS.

In a weird way... I'd compare it to JJ Abram's Star Trek. That moment when Vulcan was destroyed... A strong statement that said, ""This is a new world, with the same characters, and we're telling our own story."" (please disregard the sequel for my example)

If they keep GRRM's endgame and that's released before the books... Ugh... I don't want to think about it.","1422749254"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Uggghhhh. My first experience with the American health system outside of my university (whose health center I was delighted with and still miss) was like that. I went in at 2am or so once because I was throwing up and there was blood in it. I figured it was most likely just my throat being irritated but I'd had some warnings about spleen rupture and liver problems and various other dire possibilities with the infection I had so I just wanted someone to take a look at me and tell me I was okay. I figured at 2am it'd be a quick run in and out and since I had insurance it would be a reasonable bill. My husband seemed antsy about it but I didn't understand why. I thought he just didn't want to go out in the middle of the night.

We waited hours. There was a shift change or something and it took forever. I know it must have been eight hours because at one point my husband had to run home to check on the dogs and still had time to come back. There was a guy with an obviously broken arm who was also there for a very long time with no painkillers.

The nurse said I looked a bit dehydrated. I expected a glass of water. They gave me a drip. Eventually, FINALLY, a doctor came and looked at me and told me I was okay. Actual doctor time: about 5 minutes.

The bill was like 2 or 3k. Most of it was for the fucking drip.

We are QUITE WELL OFF and have expensive insurance. I still definitely think twice before getting health issues investigated. Stuff like severe heart flutters. I know in the end I need to have it checked out but there's that real nagging ""this will cost hundreds of dollars and I'm likely fine"". In the UK I wouldn't think twice about getting that looked at. I honestly don't know what people without much money are supposed to do. They can't get preventative care. They just CAN'T. And then when they come in on death's door their lifesaving care has to be paid out of taxes anyway, making it more expensive, and probably with far less favourable outcomes for the patients. It feels like everyone loses in this system.

I won't even get into what I'm paying for maternity care right now, but trust me when I say it's had me swearing mad and in tears, and I haven't even had the baby yet. Really raised some eyebrows when I went home for Christmas and explained all the costs I'm paying to my British family. They couldn't believe it.

I do see a lot of people ignoring that crafted gifts are expensive in a Facebook setting, but the pages I interacted with are generally more understanding so when I do see it I get annoyed. 

I in no way meant to say that you were being rude, although I can see how it came across as that, since I was responding to the disgruntled tone in the comment above mine that on a second read was implying you weren't willing to pay that much...

Florida has one of the worst track records for giving out unemployment benefits to people who were recently laid off. That's not talking about how completely shitty the state parks are (I was in the Florida Conservation Corps), they are literally filled with old tires, rusted out cars, invasive plant species and sewage dumps.

If women saw some random, normal ass looking dude like [this](http://i.imgur.com/HjVGuVD.jpg) walking down the street, I doubt they would get all excited and shit (no offence to the normal looking dude).

On the other hand, I think a lot of women are turned on when they see a normal looking erect dick on someone they're attracted to, and want to have sex with.  If they weren't turned on by it, they wouldn't be excited about having sex with them. It's not like they're going to be impressed by it's sheer size or anything, but I still think they would have to be somewhat excited about it lol. Same with the normal looking dude.

As Lance saw the Hydra opened its enormous mouth showing large spiraling teeth, he was conquered by fear and froze on the spot, similar to what happened to him earlier at the battle with the Edelma.

He was about to be swallowed whole by middle head when he was suddenly towed skyward by someone gripping him by the back collar of his bronze armor, narrowly avoiding the bite as well as the whole body mass of the Hydra that smashed the cave like a wrecking ball.

[“Would you stop spacing out every time we do battle, Lance!!!”](/aa) The witch scolded like an older sibling to the blonde teen. Ulkina was quick to materialize and pull Lance to safety the moment when they saw the Hydra charging at them.

[“I’m so sorry, Ulkina!”](/stt) Lance quickly apologized as he looked at the Hydra’s rampage beneath them. A few faceless summoners already fall prey to the five-headed serpent, crushed and mutilated in the Hydra’s mouth before being swallowed. Lance almost puked after seeing such a gruesome end.

Then the duo heard Zephyr’s telepathic message to everyone. Lance psyched himself up slapping his cheeks with both hands. [""Alright, Ulkina! What was ‘that’ trick called? Enchant Blade!?""](/stt)

[""It’s not a trick! It’s a magecraft that imbues the power of the elements into matter.""](/aa) The witch rebutted.

[""Got it. Bring me on top of its body and drop me from there.""](/stt)

Feeling that the boy regained his composure, Ulkina nodded and flew directly on top of the Hydra’s body. Reaching the top, the witch let go of her summoner and started to chant.

[""If ye trust that thy eternal bonds may be broken, then let my words be as a vengeful blade upon thee!""](/aa)

Drawing his swords on a reversed grip, Lance straightened his body as he dives head first to gain momentum. The blades ignited, and when he was about to slam on the Hydra’s dried body, he flip midair attempting to gain additional leverage before slamming the tips of his ignited blades into it.

1. QDRO, google it.

2. I have never heard of a spousal 401(k) contribution, only spousal IRA contributions. Even if you did want to contribute to his 401(k), I don't think his employer would allow you to. Why? A 401(k) account is an INDIVIDUAL retirement account. In the most basic sense that means it is like an independent bank account set up by your employer for you to make contribution towards retirement. But you raise a very interesting question and now I plan on researching to see if there is any IRS guidance on this.

3. You are named as your husband bene on the account, right? I would be more worried that something happened to him. In case he passed away you would want to guarantee that you are next in line to receive distributions from his 401(k).

4. s others have said, open up your own IRA! Most banks/financial institutions will gladly set one up for you. Talk to your bank. Read up on traditional vrs roth accounts and see what would work best for you.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**





Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

"triathlon","t5_2qhyh","Hi there :) I'm gonna do my best to answer your questions, I'm a junior's triathlon coach and used to compete at a high level.
In terms of tyres, it depends on the course if it's on roads, road tyres are the way to go, lighter and smoother,  your legs will thank you! If you have been training with off road tyres switching will feel great. 
Legs,  well some people say that they don't want to use their legs in the swim as it tires them out but at your age and fitness level I don't think that's a problem. So kick. Keep a steady cadence of small, relaxed kicks move your leg from the hip and not the knee. It's all about using the largest part of your body to move the water so use your whole leg. 
Food the day before really is up to you, carbs and proteins are good but don't overdo it ultimately it comes down to personal preference. Same goes for before the race too to be honest all I can really suggest is remember to hydrate in the morning cause it's not nice to need to drink a lot while racing. Also if you're worried about your energy levels I'd recommend energy gels you can put them in your pocket or tape them to your bike and have it about halfway through the bike session, I think it's pretty much pure sugars so it's sickly but follow it with a drink and you'll get your second wind.
My advice to first timers is definitely study the transition area, know your way in, to your space and out for both transitions, if you can master smooth transitions you have far less to worry about. Also be nice to everyone and enjoy it. Triathlon is awesome and I hope you get addicted!  Let us know how you get on?","1422749266"

&gt; or that the Chinese/South Korean mass media being biased justifies the denial of Japan's wartime atrocities?

What denial? Both China and South Korea refused to let go of the past. It is they who continue to live in denial. Every time they raise a stink over this Yasukuni nonsense, they look like a bunch of butthurt crybabies.

In fact, this may increase problems in other arenas: such as forgetting a semi-colon, the proper way to turn a string into a number, segmentation faults... b/c you are thinking on a low-level concept rather than the overall objective.

"BitcoinMarkets","t5_2wwh3","I didn't want to make the post look too big, so I'm going to include the backstory of the project below.

The project was created to allow users to come up with trading strategies using common indicators which work well for them. This is one reason all indicators run whether or not they're set as a ""Trading Indicator."" At the time, there were not many other tools that offered someone a quick solution to doing something like this.

Taking this goal further, [there's currently an enhancement issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Galts-Gulch/avarice/issues/7) to offer users a simpler way to get multi indicator strategy customization. Currently users are stuck with all signals aligning, writing their own strategy (in strategies.py), or running multiple instances.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Well, it's really hard for me to say anything remotely specific about the field of the coat of arms, except that it is party per cross, the upper left quarters and buttom right is supposed to be gules (*red*) and the upper right and buttom left quarters are supposed to be azure (*blue*). 

It looks to me like it wants to be a royal coat of arms based upon my deciphering of the crown, I am personally unsure about that, so don't hold me to it. Furthermore to add insult to injury, I do not recognise that shield as any form of royalty, and a quick search came up empty about the local areas own heraldry which isn't even remotely alike. I don't know if you get the chance or already know or not, but if you do swing by some time could you check which symbols are on the shield?

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Lets take this from the top.

You argued that welfare doesn't reduce working hours of those receiving it (in fact you argued the opposite):

&gt;This isn't entirely true. It's a rational theory that people will stop working if they don't absolutely have to, but in places where it's been tried[1] , that isn't what happens. In fact, many people JOIN the labor force who couldn't before because they can now afford childcare, ect. This is a problem of some badly designed welfare systems, but it isn't inherent to welfare.

To support this you linked to a Basic Income advocacy website whose primary source was the Mincome Experiment (and the wiki at that, not even the primary document) and all other supporting data revolves around that faulty experiment.  

I pointed out why I felt that experiment is faulty and you reject its flaws despite not really being able to rebut them.  In experiment designed to investigate the effectiveness of a system you don't get to just implement the parts of the system you think are helpful and ignore the others.  The corollary to welfare is taxes.  Taxes change behavior.  If you want to make a claim about how behavior changes in the presence of additional welfare you have implement all of it, otherwise your conclusions will be meaningless, hence the mincome experiment is mostly meaningless.   Since the mincome experiment is fundamentally flawed the source you linked concluding that welfare increases work doesn't hold water either as its only source was the mincome experiment.

If you want to cling to a source that was explicitly designed to demonstrate a progressive argument to the point that its a laughable example academic dishonesty, that's fine.

As they were off topic I will grant you the sources I provided did not pertain to the djscussion.  They do pertain to the payers and support of a system, but we seem to agree that all currently purposed basic incomes would be failures.

Ich hätte verstehen müssen, warum Du die Flucht nach vorne gesucht hast und hätte die Konfrontation nicht verschärfen sollen. Ich möchte jetzt ganz sachlich bleiben und meine Kritik, sowie Recherchen darlegen:

Die Frage wo die Primärquellen sind war an Dich gerichtet, nicht an den Autor. Ich wollte die Diskussion um die Quellen schrittweise aufbauen, da Du offensichtlich nicht das Buch mit den Primärquellen gegengeprüft hast und keinen weiteren Kontext bereitstellen konntest. Dein Geld=Böse-Thread hatte mich dazu gebracht, Dir nicht auf Augenhöhe zu begegnen, Ich hätte von Anfang an sachlich bleiben sollen. Ich habe bereits vorgestern einige Quellen des Buches rausgesucht und reingelesen. Wegen der Antwort des Autors hab Ich gestern und heute noch weiter reingelesen. Ich konnte leider gestern nicht mehr antworten, da Ich ziemlich beschäftigt war.

Ich hatte mir schon vor deiner Antwort mehrere Kritikpunkte rausgeschrieben, Ich habe sie heute Abend ergänzt, und weiter ausgeführt:

____

&gt;Für den Betrug war es nicht nötig, das Wort ""Gold"" an jeder Stelle des etwa 100 Seiten starken Vertrags durch ""United States dollar"" zu erweitern. Die hierfür wichtige Passage des ""Experts Joint Statement (April 1944)"" lautete ""The par value of a member's currency [...] shall be expressed in terms of gold"" und wurde auf der Konferenz nachts umgeschrieben in """"The par value of the currency of each member shall be expressed in terms of gold [...] or in terms of the United States dollar [...].""

Erstens: Stimmt. Ich hatte mich falsch ausgedrückt und hatte eine falsche Version des Vertrags. Sehr amateurhaft.

Ansonsten ist die Beschreibung des Autors ist eine maximale Übersimplifizierung. Das Experts Joint Statement ist ein Prä-Bretton-Woods Vertragsentwurf und die erste von insgesamt **vier** Versionen. Siehe [hier](http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/hfs/Concordances.xls). Zwischen dem Final Act und dem Experts Joint Statement lag sogar noch die [Atlantic City Conference](http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/wwii/98681.htm). Da hat sich bestimmt ganz schön viel verändert.

Ferner behauptet [der Autor](http://weltmachtgeld.de/downloads/Der_Dollar_war%27s._Und_nicht_die_Gier.pdf) und sich [auf ihn berufende Quellen](http://www.zeitpunkt.ch/news/artikel-einzelansicht/artikel/bretton-woods-der-jahrhundertbetrug.html), dass die Ergänzung von ""US Dollar"" zu ""Gold"" nicht verhandelt wurde. Um mich kurz zu halten: das ist falsch. Und Ich möchte das auch belegen:

Der letzte ""Vollentwurf"" (Das ""*[New Testament](http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/hfs/Concordances.xls)*"") vor dem ""*Final Act*"" ([Document 492, S.936](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/books/1948_state_bwood_v1.pdf)) war das ""*Report of the Drafting Committee of Commission I*"" ([Document 321, S.527](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/books/1948_state_bwood_v1.pdf)). In ihm steht zu den par values in Article IV, Section 1 noch die alte Version:

&gt;The  par  value  of  the  currency  of  each  member  shall  be expressed  in  terms  of  gold,  as  a  common  denominator,  or  in terms  of  a  gold-convertible  currency  unit  of  the  weight  and fineness in effect on July 1,1944.

In der Sitzung vom 13. Juli (vor der besagten Manipulationsnacht) fordert die indische Delegation die generelle Definition von ""*gold convertable change*"", woraufhin vorgeschlagen wird, ""*gold convertable change*"" als ""*United States Dollar*"" zu definieren, weil Dollar damals wahrscheinlich für viele wohl die beste Option als gold-konvertierungsfähiges Zahlungsmittel bot. Die britische Delegation war übrigens auch dafür; nachzulesen direkt im Transkript der [Sitzung vom 13. Juli (S.28)](http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/bw/Chapter_05_Commission_I_July_13.pdf).

Daher schlägt White vor, das Thema dem Special Committee zu überlassen (Transkript S.28). Niemand wendete etwas ein, also geschieht das auch.

In den offiziellen Minutes (Minute= Sitzungsbericht/Protokoll) der Sitzung vom 13. Juli steht dazu folgendes:

&gt;The query with regard to the definition of gold-convertible exchange was also referred to the Special Committee with the suggestion that itmight prove advisable to substitute the phrase “United  States  dollars”.

&gt;([Doc 370](http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/books/1948_state_bwood_v1.pdf), S.599)


Am darauffolgenden Tag ([14.Juli](http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/bw/Chapter_06_Commission_I_July_14.pdf)) startete die Sitzung der Commission I mit dem Report des Special Committees:

&gt;REPORTER OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE:

&gt;Mr. Chairman, the Special Committee of Commission I commenced work last night at 8;30 and continued its work until 3:30 this morning to consider items of the Fund Agreement on which recommendations had not been completed by other committees of the Commission. This Special Comittee included U.S., Belgium, Canada, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, French Delegation, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, U.S.S.R  and U.K.

Es handelt sich hier um ein und dasselbe Committee - also das, welches ""gold convertible change"" in ""United States Dollar"" geändert hat. Wieso spricht der Autor hier von den ""Amerikanern""? In dem Spezialkommittee sind 12 Nationen drin gewesen.

Jedenfalls wird nun -am 14. Juli- der Ersatz von ""gold convertible exchange"" durch ""United States Dollar"" angenommen (Im [Transkript](http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/bw/Chapter_06_Commission_I_July_14.pdf) auf Seite 8):

&gt;In the discussion of article III,  section 3b  (p.  3), it was agreed that  the  word  “net”  would  be  inserted before  “official”  and  **“United  States dollars” would be substituted for “gold convertible exchange**”  and  that a  definition  of  “net”  would  be  included  in the  definitions.

&gt;(Hier wieder zitiert aus dem Sitzungsprotokoll: [Doc 393 - Minutes of Meeting of Commission I](http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/books/1948_state_bwood_v1.pdf), S.628)


Die Definition von ""gold and gold convertible change"" wurde also offensichtlich überall eingesetzt, wo Sie im vorherigen Vertragswerk bereits vorhanden war; auch bei  Artikel IV mit den par values.

Die neue Schreibweise mit ""Dollar"" ist ab hier in folgenden Dokumenten zu finden: *Working Draft - Fund Agreement* (16.Juli, Doc 413, S.655), *Report of the Special Committee of Commission I* (18. Juli, Doc 447, S.765) und *Report of Commission I (International Monetary Fund) to the Executive Plenary Session* (20.Juli, Doc 472, S.864)

Ich glaube also eher nicht, dass White hier 44 Nationen gegen ihren Willen ausgetrickst hat, sondern eher, dass der *gold exchange standard* gewollt war und der Dollar wurde als Lösung dazu bevorzugt war; Keynes' Bancor und International Clearing Union wurde ja schon früh abgelehnt. Sidenote: Ich werte nicht bezüglich Keynes oder dem gesamten Bretton Woods-System. Aber ich würde gerne weitgehend geschichtliche Fakten darstellen.

Nochmal meine Quellen: [Morgenthau Diaries](http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/archives/collections/franklin/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=535&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=188897#id188897) und [Transkripte der Committee-Sitzungen.](http://www.centerforfinancialstability.org/brettonwoods_docs.php)

_____

Auch ansonsten passen die Zitate der Morgenthau Tagebücher oft gar nicht:

Bezüglich der [von White kontrollierten Spezialkommittees](http://www.zeitpunkt.ch/news/artikel-einzelansicht/artikel/bretton-woods-der-jahrhundertbetrug.html) ""die hinter verschlossenen Türen tagen"" (das taten alle Subcommittees), stimmen einfach die Zitate nicht. Verwiesen wird auf [Band 753](http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/_resources/images/morg/md1043.pdf), Seite 224-287. Dort findet man von 224-252 aber nur belanglose Korrespondenz mit chinesischen -und dannach spanischen- Beamten. Dann irgendwas mit Kriegsflüchtlingen in der Schweiz. Das Dokument hört auf Seite 279 des Tagebuchs mit einem Kriegsreport auf.

Da es sein könnte, dass die Zitate nur falsch wiedergegeben sind, oder die Quellen eine andere Numerierung haben, höre Ich an der Stelle auf. Die zentrale Behauptung des Autors denke Ich sowieso durch zeithistorische Dokumente widerlegt zu haben. Offensichtlich hatte niemand was gegen den *Gold-Dollar-Standard*, sonst hätte bei zwei Gelegenheiten in der Commission I **und** im Special Committee Einspruch erhoben werden können.","1422749275"

They're smaller, but they're louder, so they appear larger.

This is what frightens me about the new PC movement. Every major political movement has been tiny, as far as representation in the population goes. The silent majority is unmoving. If you examine revolutions, you'll invariably find that they are not done by ""the will of the people"" but by the actions of a small segment of the population. The only reason they can pull it off is because they give enough of a damn, and nobody else is willing to stop them.

The PC movement is *very* loud, and spreads through social media. Social media traps them in echo chambers (just like it does to every other ideology), so they have the false impression that most people share their beliefs. It stagnates. They are extremely proactive, and they silence any dissent against them with accusations of racism and sexism.

If unchecked, it's a recipe for disaster. It's impossible to have dialogue without being shouted down. You can only share the approved opinions. It truly is poison in the blood of democracy.","1422749281"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Yeah, I know you didn't, but you were - I was telling people who disagree with you to tell us why.

Now you're just putting words in mouths here. I never said women are disgusting or else. Also, the guy *never* said he was anti-feminism or made any anti-feminism remarks. He just doesn't like people who put their political stance on a dating profile because, more often than not, according to his experiences, that person happens to be very opinionated and extremist. It just so happens he dates women and the political instance in this case is feminism. Disliking that =/= FUCK FEMINISM AND FEMINISTS. He's just trying to weed out the crazy ones, and he has every right to do so. Judging by what he said, if he dated a regular woman who, after meeting, in a conversation, made a remark about being a feminist when the subject presented itself, I doubt he would dump her and judge her as harshly. The context would be different, and she wouldn't appear to be a crazy political extremist who must push her moral horse in a relationship by the first impression. *That's* who we are judging here, not feminism.

*These* women are being hypocrites for yelling ""DON'T TELL US WHAT TO DO!!1"" while telling *him* what to do. These things go both ways, you know. He has the right to voice how he feels about the matter and how he thinks it would be better. Even if he's wrong, he has the right to have an opinion and talk about it, that's why it matters. It's not about controlling women and telling them what to do, it's about our opinion on what they're doing. Also, being butthurt, downvoting and going ""DONT U DARE COME HERE AND SAY THAT!!"" just for the sake of trying to censor someone because you disagree isn't a very convincing argument on their side. Telling him why he's wrong and why it's not a good thing to do would be a better way to go.

Equality is men and women being able to talk about and judge the fuck out of each other and what they do without someone going ""holy shit u cant say that how dare u have an opinion on what someone is doing"" like they're have some sort of victim complex. Of course they can complain, but please if you're gonna do so, come up with something better than ""You can't come up here and say things that we don't agree with"".","1422749282"

0x + (4-2(h^(2)+3h))y = 10 - 3(h^(2)+3h)

you can solve for which h make that 0x+0y=.... and check for each h whether the right side is 0 or not.

Edit:

There's  a shortcut. If two quadratics ax^(2)+bx+c and dx^(2)+ex+f have a root in common, it must also be a root of

d(ax^(2)+bx+c) - a(dx^(2)+ex+f) = (db-ae)x+(dc-af)

In my case I had to go in three times. The no-show defendant actually got the court to vacate the default judgment and then kept extending. Even if they are in the same jurisdiction, court is a pain in the ass. 

If Leo files in his own jurisdiction, as I originally assumed, FF will not travel. Refund, case closed.

"television","t5_2qh6e","I know the article says that the publishing company ruled out a 2015 release, but that isn't strictly true.  There is still possibility for it to be released in the later half of this year.  Basically, the publisher at this time hasn't received anything except what GRRM is contractually obligated to provide (160-ish pages)  That being said, GRRM is hesitant to hand over more manuscript pages to the editor, because for ADWD, much of his ""finished pages"" ended up having to be rewritten multiple times.  So GRRM is sitting on an unknown amount of finished writing.  When he does finish the writing and turn it in to his editors, there can be most likely about a 4-5 month turnover period for it to be published.  Say he finishes writing in April and hands everything over.  6 months after that, which is slower than my estimates, would lead to an october publishing date.  Whether or not something like this will actually happen is complete speculation, because nobody really knows how much GRRM has done, not even his editors.  He's being very tight lipped about the whole thing.  Maybe I'm just being optimistic, but just because TWOW is ""not currently on the release schedule"" doesnt mean that can't change when he does submit manuscript.","1422749286"

&gt;I've asked for help before, but I'm not completely comfortable with spending a ton of money and not understanding what I'm doing completely.  I have a lot of little questions.  I want to build my own pc and I know some, but every time I think I understand something, I'm wrong. :/

&gt; What I'm faced with currently is finding a motherboard.  I picked an AMD processor, so I need an AMD motherboard, right?  I see the motherboard says DDR3 1866, and so on and so forth.  So, say I'm shooting for 1866 because that is my greatest speed, right?

&gt; And say my motherboard has four memory slots.  Do I need to fill all four memory slots in order to reach 1866?  

&gt; I know there are a lot more factors that will determine this, but could this handle games at max settings efficiently or do I need to step it up?

To start answering your questions, yes, if you've chosen an AMD processor, you'll need a motherboard with a matching AMD socket, probably an AM3+ socket.

1866 MHz is the speed of the RAM.  In terms of gaming performance, there is only a tiny difference in framerates between 1866 MHz and, say, 1333 MHz.

No, there's no need to fill all 4 memory slots to achieve 1866 MHz.  Ideally at least 2 slots would be filled in order to take advantage of the slight speed boost offered by Dual Channel RAM.

The single biggest factor in determining your gaming performance is the graphics card.  The RAM and CPU play roles as well, but I'd say 75% of your framerate comes from the GPU.

In general, I'd suggest having a look at the sidebar.  There are tons of really good guides in those links, and they will help you to make educated decisions about parts and compatibility.

http://www.pcpartpicker.com/ is a fantastic tool to pick out your parts.  Start with the CPU, and when you go to choose a motherboard, the site will automatically filter out incompatible boards by default.  As you select your motherboard, RAM, PSU, etc, the website will continue to automatically filter out incompatible components, and will provide warnings on parts that may be incompatbile with each other.","1422749287"

I have horrible skin. My entire body is just gross, and that's saying something because I don't have high standards at all. And then there's the fact that I'm an addict, have a personality disorder, anxiety disorder and chronic depression. The mental health issues come from my mother's side. The vast majority of us are on anti-depressants. The addiction comes from both sides. But on my mom's side I had a 2nd cousin who was both mentally unstable and an addict, and he ended up brutally slaughtering his brother and father. Honestly, I think I probably would have had more in common with that man than anyone else related to me. My ""father"" aka sperm donor is an alcoholic. He bailed on me before I was old enough to realise that and only know because my half brothers and sisters tracked me down on Facebook and we're now in contact. But my father is also fat and not particularly good looking. I fully blame him for my looks. The cherry on top is the fact that my 2 sisters, whom I don't share the same father with, are very pretty.

Basically, over the past year or so my intrusive thoughts have terrified me into thinking I'm a paedophile. I never actually picture naked kids or me raping them or anything like that, rather I'll suddenly think of paedophilia in an abstract way and then start freaking out about why I'm thinking this, normal people don't think about this, I'm a monster etc. Then I start trying to justify it by telling myself that I didn't actually think about fucking kids and that I'm not sexually interested in them, but although I know it's true it just feels... disingenuous. Like, I feel that since I'm thinking it to make me feel better that it's not true, although it is. 

This kills me because I really do love kids, and although I now know that intrusive thoughts are a fairly widespread phenomenon, I'm still terrified that I might one day become capable of what I despise the most.","1422749288"

Once I can superb him, I will indeed max that out. The reason I don't at the moment is because the HP debuff is great for everyone in the position and he already has a giant HP pool/good damage from my Ace (Hiro).

In terms of Hildegard, I prioritize damage before anything so I am quite possibly in the wrong here. I don't have her fully superbed at the moment, but what I run is Extreme and Remove Safety Device (this may be purely due to the fact that I was using her a lot before the winter update). From personal experience, maxing these two usually helps me penetrate the backline and the midline. If mid isn't penetrated, I'll usually do a large chunk of damage with the crit. damage.

It was an odd experience - I rarely think of those days anyway, but this time, I *was* there - transported back 30-odd years to a more ""innocent"" time, flirting with a forbidden fruit. I won't claim I had a hallucination, but I've never had a sense-memory (of the taste) come back to me so strongly.

Maybe it put me in a weirdly receptive state or something, IDK... But his other points (it's a poison, offers *nothing* of value, devastating, etc.) began to seep into my consciousness, and I actually found my cravings *far* less frequent and distracting than I once did.

I'd say finish the read, maybe wait a day or two, then read it again. Maybe something will go *click* for you too.","1422749293"

La verdad es lo que queria saber, compartiamos el  mismo tipo de estrabismo (incluso en el mismo ojo, bah, aunque puedo alternar el ojo con el que veo )

Vi mil videos y todo en youtube y encontrar este subreddit fue la gloria, mas aun sabiendo que alguien no tan lejos tambien se opero.

Por el tema del dolor, si se que el resultado es bueno, creo que vale la pena. Y sin dudas no tener mas el ""me estas preguntando a mi?"" tambien es genial.

Yo en el aspecto personal creo que somos iguales, siempre fue ""esto es estetico y puedo vivir con esto"" pero creo que va mas alla de lo estetico. 

El 19 de Marzo tengo la consulta medica , la ultima vez que fui por lentes me dijo la oculista que podian operarme y que talvez me saldria gratis (detalle no menor) .

Estos dias leyendo, viendo y pensando todo sin dudas me sentiria super raro si me llegaran a alinear ambos ojos, y entiendo que no te sentis ""vos"" pero bueno.

Una sola pregunta mas, a que edad te operaste?

If religion never existed, economics, power, greed, lust will still give people a reason want each other dead. And religion does not often end in killing as you state. Most religions condemn murder. The 6th commandment explicitly states that you should not murder. Buddhism go as far in that some monks even refuse to cut down a tree because of their belief it is a sentient being. 84% of the world practices some form of religion and they are not all going out there in crusades and jihads.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Alright, so, everyone is harping on the names, I'm just gonna trust that you got it and point out a few other things I noticed:

First and foremost, as /u/TheBishopsBane pointed out, those weird straight lines are great for deciding what goes where, but on your final map, you probably want your boundaries to be a little more natural.

And the thing is, there are some really fantastic natural boundaries here to work with. Look, south and east of the Thorn Forest, but north of the Goldwood is a fantastic little region all it's own. Bounded by rivers, lakes and forests. Likewise, that river that is smack-dab in the middle of the riverlands runs all the way to the mountains, effectively cutting off the frozen north, making a great natural boundary. I'm sure you get the idea. Think about how armies would carve out areas for themselves. It's much easier to defend a mountain pass or a river that must be crossed at bridges or forded than it is to defend a straight line that cuts through all these features. 

Another thing that vaguely bugs me is that you have a region called the Fire Jungle located at roughly the same latitude as a place called the Ice woods. Now, I'm more than willing to accept some weird, exotic and magical places, but it seems to me like the fire jungle might be better off further south. 

Also, it seems like in places your rivers just sort of... pop into existence. And while that's not nessicarily bad, just about every major river I can think of starts off somewhere in the mountains somewhere. 

It is a really great map though! I love all the little touches you've put in: the small cluster of islands in Dolton bay, the Volcano in the middle of the ocean. It's all awesome.","1422749295"

I and 4 others are from the desert of Arizona, another from California, and England. so all in all we are group that has a personal friendship with each other and want that to grow with new people. Age range is older teens to adults and is looking for that range. We have a lvl 136 TH10 with max troops that we use for donations etc.. We are mostly TH8s+ with some TH7s getting ready for the next upgrade. We have won 44 wars in our last clan but are looking for a fresh start. Our current war times are Wednesday 6 pm EST. And Saturday 12pm EST. Let’s get it on. We have experienced members offering good advice and attack strategies.

2.) TH7 and up with upgrades that match TH level (no TH8 with TH5 upgrades)
3.) 2 Elder positions are up for competition every 2 weeks based on activeness and highest donations (3 term elders get $20 GEMS card.)

But the people you hang out with are selected on the basis of superficial pleasantness and not intelligence.  You're getting low quality insight from them, by your own admission of not selecting on the basis of intellect.

I am a cis-gendered son of a bitch, and it is my choice. If I started preaching about it someone would flip shit like you are now saying I am oppressing them. You are oppressing me, how about that? It is also a choice to want to dress like an animal. Asking that we should put trees in the bathroom so he can be comfortable!?!?! WTF is that. And if the whole mental illness argument was valid he would not be videotaping it, they would have had him detained and locked away, in a trazadone coma, like they do my friend who has voices in his head and starts harming himself. No, they clearly think he must have this right or are afraid of lawsuit in case he does. If you guys/gals/guygals can't see WTF I am saying than I piety you.

I identify as a punk rocker, and it is an important part of my personality, but I have to hide my tattoos and shit, why?

Recent studies have shown that this practice can have massive benefits in nearly every aspect of life (health, mental, psychological etc) and makes you feel like you are in control of life rather than the other way around. I would cite specific studies/research but have read dozens of them and don't' feel like looking them up right now. I know ucla did a big study.

In regards to ChiEX I just feel really vulnerable a lot of the time, I find with Serenity I can cheese a lot of trash packs with the BOF glyph and also on a boss fight I can just build massive shuffle then tip most of my chi into Purifying Brew etc Though I certainly agree the AOE damage on ChiEX is amazing.

I actually read somewhere when I was learning to monk before starting these that I should keep RJW up even on single target as its still a dps increase.

I'll certainly have to start watching my energy a lot closer, I guess it's because I don't everything down to reflex yet that I'm still having to think and try and watch a lot of other things.

"Cartalk","t5_2s47e","This was one of the worst diesel engines, ever.  That series of Olds and Caddy diesels pretty much single-handedly made America hate oil burners.  My Dad had an '81 Olds 98 Regency coupe with the 350 diesel, and it was horrible... it was also the car I learned to drive in.   My parents trusted me with it because it was so damn slow I couldn't possibly get into trouble with it.   

The standard engine in that Caddy, however, was possibly a worse engine -- the Caddy 350 V8-6-4 with cam-activated cylinder shutdown.  

I'd see if you can get a 350 to fit it, but I'd be concerned about finding one that will sit on a front wheel drive tranny mount.  You might be better off trying to find a whole power train from a junkyard for the car.   

That being said, unless you have some amazing emotional attachment to this car and a lot of money to burn, it's going to be cheaper and easier to buy an already running example.

But if you design the paint can forge well enough, it may be useful for heat treating small knives. That's all I occasionally use mine for. 

Building a basic and effective forge won't really be too much more expensive or complex anyway (mine was essentially free since I had everything just laying around. A lot of different materials will work fine. You'd be surprised. Hell, some people make forges from wheelbarrows and grills) 

With a basic forge, you'll be able to get a much better and more accurate taste of blacksmithing. And if you find yourself interested in smithing, your forge is already done! You already would've saved yourself time and money. ","1422749310"

There are plenty of cheap options you will find just about anywhere you can find hobby supplies (amazon, hobby or model shop, etc), and they are all going to be pretty much identical. There is absolutely no need to spend the kind of money GW want for their branded one.

Decent quality micro drill bits are another story, but they still aren't going to be that expensive. If your pin vice comes with a couple of starters, great, but you will probably want a wider selection of specific sizes, especially for magnetizing. You want a set that generally goes from sub 1mm sizes (0.6/0.8mm etc) and up to about 2mm for general barrel and component drilling, pinning and infantry magnetizing. Beyond that you can get away with a few specific sizes for whatever size magnets you find yourself using for larger jobs.","1422749310"

His guardians had to escort his body to a ruin in order to do so. Now the evil forces have began to break through the barrier and a new hero is destined to be capable of saving the land with the help of his guardians.

Basically what I'm saying is I have built a world and a story around this idea to support it. The hero can fail, he is just prophecied to have the power to disrupt the evil.

I have created a world for the players to explore. I am just giving them a main story arch to follow so they always have the option to move forward.

Plus, for somebody who seems to be so upset about racism, you sure are painting ""White Europeans"" (your words and capitalization, not mine), with an incredibly broad brush, as though white Europeans are a homogenous group, or all racist.

If you will come to Lebanon or to Syria to fight against us we have the advantage of knowing to ground, as well as in a Symmetric Warfare we have the upper hand.

Your misiles may hit here and there, but you can be sure that your country will get back to the middle ages, including any other Arab country that may help you with land invasion (and im having doubts that Lebanon will let you use her land).

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","There isn't much risk involved, he can still end it whenever he wants.

While it's true you are likely to reciprocate positively in some form or another to any advances from him if he is above you, it's not a given that you'd give in to full on casual no strings attached sex. If he tries that first, and is then rejected, the likelihood of ""I love you"" working falls dramatically. After all, if it's obviously that he's looking for no strings attached sex, why would he suddenly proclaim his love for you. So then, trying to get you emotionally attached first would be the obvious strategic choice.

&gt;And what if we were already sleeping together before they said 'I love you'.

I'd argue it could be a means to ensure the continuation of that arrangement. Though I admit there is a risk of destroying such an arrangement by admitting to having emotions for the other part, so I'd wager it's seen less often due to that risk. 

Now there are obviously other reasons too, for instance it's not uncommon to develop emotions after having had sex one or more times, tough these emotions aren't always.. ..permanent. Guys know what I'm talking about. Simply put, it's more ""worth it"" for a man to bond with the female if the phenotype of the female indicate very good genes, after all that would increase his fitness. 

So even in such cases, dating downwards would increase your chance of being loved first, as the likelihood of a guy falling in love is higher if he is fucking upwards. That's obvious, as the purpose of love is to increase our fitness. 

&gt;There are too many variables in your theory to say for sure. Also, it's hurtful to go ahead and assume I needed confirmation that I wasn't good enough for another person.

I'll agree it's slightly speculative, I'm sure the picture is clouded by even more complex interactions. But the essence I think holds true, that there is a conflict between the sexes in terms of cost and benefit related to sex and parental investment, and that as such there is a constant struggle as both sexes want to maximize their fitness ignorant to the cost of the other. With this as a basis everything else follows, though hashing out exactly what forms the social dynamic patterns etc are likely to attain is slightly more tricky. As for the last sentence, please don't see it that way. I hit on a very beautiful girl once, and she turned me down. She soon after started dating a very smart and handsome guy. Does that mean I wasn't good enough for her? Arguably yes, but only in terms of my ability to successfully initiate a male-female pair bond.","1422749322"
"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","Forever copy and pasting this response when the question arises.

 from /u/SuperMoonky on numerous other LEGO game requests:


&gt; As always, adding a LEGO guide to newcomers to the franchise or people who have only dabbled in LEGO briefly in the past (this will only cover WB games featured and not include others) - now with LEGO Batman 3.

&gt; **LEGO Batman 1** - A fairly ok title with your favourite caped crusader launching himself into the spotlight for his first solo outing. The game has not aged well and has some poor mechanics (especially in the vehicle handling). A nice little title to jump in but not required if you want to move to LEGO Batman 2. Personally I would say avoid this unless you're really interested.

&gt; **LEGO Batman 2** - Now this is where the LEGO titles of today started off. First game to include voice acting (with Troy Baker giving a wonderful Batman) and the first one to feature a fully open world (previous games were always small hubs with levels). The story is pretty much Lex Luthor teaming up with the Joker and for anyone who has seen the LEGO Batman movie you'll know what the plot is. Best addition to this is the addition of the Justice League and heroes such as Superman (when he is flying around in the open world the John Williams theme plays), The Flash, Wonder Woman and the rest. This was the best LEGO title in my book till LEGO Marvel took the crown.

&gt; **LEGO Batman 3** - This was created by the same guys who did LEGO Batman 2 and LEGO Marvel and it shows in the quality, the story follows on from LEGO Batman 2 but only a small link between the two and once again has the Justice League featured alongside Batman and Robin trying to beat Brainiac. The difference between this and LEGO Batman 2/LEGO Marvel is that it takes place on several hub worlds and it doesn't feel as connected as the previous games, that aside it has some wonderful moments (including an awesome ending and a level involving 60's Batman), Voice acting is superb too, they have cameos from Adam West, Conan, Stephen Amell and more. If you're a LEGO fan you will enjoy this, the season pass might be best to wait till the other packs are out before you buy it (the levels in the season pass are like 10 minutes long). Lastly, you have a huge amount of Characters in this game - every DC character you could think of is in this. I still feel this game lacks a little bit of what made LEGO Batman 2 and LEGO Marvel great but it's still up there as a decent LEGO title.

&gt; **LEGO Movie The Videogame** - Honestly I do think this is the weakest entry out of the recent LEGO games, better if you have seen the movie and enjoyable for a short time if you haven't but the problem is the game felt a bit rushed (to tie into the movie probably) and in a few places it lacks the magic other titles have managed to capture. It's still a LEGO game but if you're playing it after playing some of the others you might feel it's a bit lacking. That said it does feature clips from the movie and it's still funny, just missing some gameplay IMO.

&gt; **LEGO Harry Potter 1 and 2** - I can't speak for 2 since I have yet to complete 1, what I can say is that if you're a fan of Harry Potter these are probably some of the best games you'll find dealing with his world, Harry Potter 1 is the first four films and Harry Potter 2 is the last set of movies. You might not get the story as much unless you have seen the movies as these do not feature voice acting.

&gt; **LEGO LOTR** - This is pure movie magic, it takes the world of Peter Jackson and dumps it into LEGO form. You have an open world Middle Earth to explore with locations from every movie, from Hobbiton to Mordor. Another game to feature voice acting (this one takes it directly from the movie - but cut slightly to make it work in a family friendly game). It has hilarious moments from each movie redone in LEGO to make them even more funny. One of my favourite LEGO titles of all time.

&gt; **LEGO Hobbit** - This is pretty much the same formula as LEGO LOTR reusing the same Middle Earth map from LOTR but changing/replacing some places to make it into the Hobbit trilogy instead. The game features the first 2 movies (with the third supposedly being DLC coming soon) and might feel a bit incomplete because of that. I personally found it enjoyable, but felt it lacked something that LOTR had.

&gt; **LEGO Marvel** - Save the best to last? That's what I have done, this is without a doubt in my mind the best LEGO game to date. Everything is here, a huge list of characters (even some you might not know about), a wide open New York with the Shield Helicarrier above, crazy side mission levels narrated by Deadpool (Nolan North), races, a compelling story and great level design. This is a dream for any LEGO/Marvel fan, if you enjoy any of those then you should pick this up.

&gt; **As a disclaimer, I would like to point out none of these have mouse support and all are best played with a controller since a Keyboard can be annoying to aim (but not impossible).**","1422749322"

There's a language to film, and just like any other language, at a certain level you just kind of know it inherently. You understand the semantics and the inner workings -  you don't have to think about how the noun and the verb go together and where to put a conjunction, you just know how to use it to achieve what you need to...

"flying","t5_2qm1t","A few weeks ago I posted a whole heap of questions about getting into flying, and shortly after that I booked a flight - Well, yesterday the weather finally cleared up and it was *amazing* - Actual flight is just so much more... Intuitive than sim flying. Also, the graphics are a bit better.
 
After takeoff, we headed straight for a designated practice zone where I got to maneuver the plane a bit, and he showed me things like what Zero-G feels like (I've never felt so odd in my life.) - And 2G was weird. Then he stalled the plane once or twice, which was also really strange. It's not something you're used to when you've only been in the back of a 737.

The C172 was absolutely fantastic, plenty of space for me and the instructor, who actually turned out to be just a couple of years older than I am - I was expecting some sixty-something guy, but then again, I guess those are all flying for IcelandAir by now.

In the end, I think I'll absolutely get a PPL - It costs about 14,000$, and I think that'll be worth it.

That's the message of subconscious ""giving up"" the 49ers sent: rather than give this special coach total control, we'll turn to someone **we can** control. They got a much lesser coach and unknown commodity for the feeling of control. With the NFL you will have to deal with less competent coaches if you want total control.

Coaches who are very competent will turn to the college game where they will get total control. There are very few good NFL jobs and even fewer where the owner and GM are ""hands off"" enough to cede real power to the coach. ","1422749326"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;the Governor General does have the power to overrule this bill on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen of England.

Actually, they don't. 

This is one of the interesting facts of Canadian Constitutional Law. It's sort of a combination of the 'written' constituional law of the US, and the 'unwritten' law of the UK.

Some things, which have constitutionally binding power are 'conventions', which are unwritten aspects of how our system functions but which are not in the constitution itself.

There is for, example, nothing in the constitution anywhere which mentions a Prime Minister or Cabinet, or Ministers of X y or Z as things that exist or have certain powers. Those positions exist entirely by convention. 

Similarly, the 'Governor in Council' segment of the Consitution does not actually refer to the governor general, it refers to the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Though technically the Governor General grants Royal Assent to a bill on behalf of the Queen, this is entirely ceremonial.

Peter Hogg, a leading Canadian Constitutional Scholar puts it this way:

&gt;There is undoubtedly a convention that the Queen or Governor General or Lieutenant-Governor will not withhold the royal assent from bills which have been passed by the appropriate legislative chambers, but I am not aware of that any Queen or King or Governor General or Lieutenant Governor has ever explicitly acknowledged the obligation. The convention is well understood although tacit.

In fact, the Governor General *did* try to exercise this power before. Only once. It led to what was then called the [King-Byng Affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%E2%80%93Byng_Affair), and even then was used not to veto a bill but in a refusal to dissolve parliament.

It led to reforms and the [Statute of Westminster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931) in 1931, which has eliminated any imperial or non-formal power the Governor General ever had.

And even if this *hadn't*, the repatriation of the Constitution Act 1982 would have. It specifically disavows any British or monarchic power over Canadian political systems.

What is written on paper is not even half of what the actual law is. There is a reason this practice is long since fallen away. The law has changed incredibly since it was last used, as has culture in general.","1422749326"

"tifu","t5_2to41","You didn't fuck up at that point. Maybe you did at the start by not making it clear what you wanted out of it. Getting as much as you can out into the open at the start or near the start is a good way to save time being invested into the wrong person. 

You have a decision to make... Either continue on with what he wants, which is likely to continue what you have while looking for better options, or to drop it and find someone that is more compatible with what you are looking for. Or do it the way a lot of males, and some females do. Continue with what you have now, while looking for someone better. Once that better person comes along, drop them, like they will likely drop you if a better option comes along. 

Just to be clear... No male is ""scared of commitment"" It's just an excuse to give to not come off as even more of an asshole with their true intentions. Like ""I like you and all, just not like that"". 

Now with that said. Depending on his looks, money, and other desirables his options could be wide open, or fairly closed. Even if you are his one true best option, finding you may make him think that, well if he found you, maybe something better is around the corner. Once reality hits, he may come back around to that and realize that you are. If his options are more open, and you know he can find someone he is more compatible with, like someone who ""nags"" less about certain things, or is more in-tune sexually and whatnot they will generally go into that direction. If that is your case, then cutting your losses now is probably going to be the smart move. 

The only other thing I will add right now is ""how important is it to you to have a commitment?"" If it's not that important then it doesn't really matter, but since you have said this it seems that it's at least somewhat important to you. So do you want to waste more time with someone who doesn't want what you want in that regard in hopes they change their mind one day and choose you, or simply cut your losses and look for someone new and take what you have learned so far, and apply that to the new person in hopes of wasting less time.

I could hear them run across my mattress on the floor for a bed every night. I got some cash and about $50 of Walmart gift cards for Christmas about 2 weeks after we moved in. I spent the gift cards on mouse traps and poison, and took some of the cash to the liquor store. So I'm sitting there at 11:00pm, drinking cheap bourbon, watching Letterman. I had set out all the traps, baited with pizza scraps, behind the couch, in the corners of the room, under my chair... They were everywhere. About 8 or 10 traps. I was the hunter. *Sip*...

I refilled my glass. 5 hours later (My step brother woke up at 6 for his job), I had trapped 14 mice and was almost done with a liter of cheap bourbon.

&gt;

&gt;**Jesus the Good Shepherd**  
[**1**] “Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a bandit.  [**2**] The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.  [**3**] The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.  [**4**] When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.  [**5**] They will not follow a stranger, but they will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.”  [**6**] Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. [**7**] So again Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.  [**8**] All who came before me are thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them.  [**9**] I am the gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture.  [**10**] The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. [**11**] “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  [**12**] The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.  [**13**] The hired hand runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep.  [**14**] I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,  [**15**] just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.  [**16**] I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.  [**17**] For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again.  [**18**] No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.” [**19**] Again the Jews were divided because of these words.  [**20**] Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind. Why listen to him?”  [**21**] Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”

As long as the devices are used mostly to measure your mental state during meditation (instead of producing it), I don't see any much harm. But, again, I will eventually try it and write my concusions in the blog. If I feel that going in the direction of the device's feedback is actually not helping to understand/deepen meditation, than that is where the harm could be.

Mind is extremely subtle and volatile, and it would be very helpful to have a visual feedback on what is happening on my mind as I try different ways of focusing my attention. As you say, this technology is still in its infancy.

So spoilers.

From memory, there's a backstory also about how Ozai married her because she was the blood of the avatar yadda yadda. This guy who was originally with her got fucked over hard by the fire nation yadda yadda. So after she left the fire nation for killing azulon she went back to her old town and went to a swamp or lake or something. There was a spirit there that allowed for her to make her forget everything and change her face, so she did that.

So Zuko teams up with the gaang and Azula (who is constantly being an asshole but she has vital information so she needs to come with) and kind of find her. But the mother doesn't recognize them obviously. They tell the story to her and she's like 'oh I want to remember' and I think it ends with a blue ballsy ending like that, nothing more significant happened.

IMO it was a pretty big cop-out and the whole writing was so forced. But, entertaining enough.","1422749330"

I didn't want to live my life this way and stupidly contemplated suicide. Until that is, I read eastern philosophy, and how life is a game or drama. You get clouded by the world around you, and you have to be true to your true self.

Not really an obstacle, other than a mental one. However, I almost threw away my chances of going to university and studying what I truly love.

I've had to do it and Ive had other members of my former staff have to do it numerous times and unfortunately it's part of running a business. 


You'd be surprised how many people are travelling through life facing the same challenges you are presently facing. It happened every few months and believe me it was very difficult having ""the talk"" with valued employees and knowing the struggle they were going through after seeing it first hand in my own family.


The people in your life who love you already know you're off the track. They are waiting for you to come to your senses, open up to them and let them help you through this. 


Please get help. Don't make excuses. you owe it to yourself and the people around you to get better.


70k jobs aren't easy to get and more than likely if you lose this one you'll slip a little further down the hole. Don't let that happen.

I'm a librarian and if I want to work in a corporate library or a museum or a nonprofit or somewhere other than a city or university (where there is usually a set/posted budget for the position that you can't really negotiate out of), I really have no idea what to ask for. And even in the same part of the country or the same city, the range varies *so much*. A librarian can make $20k...a librarian can make $70k. It's so hard to predict what their range will be.

[Y: the last man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man) is definitely to be recommended. It's a bit longer but a fantastic story. The same writer/artist team has an ongoing series right now, [Saga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_(comic_book\)), which is on of the best series currently. 

very weird but very great at the same time is [Black Hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hole_(comics\)). 

Another favorite of mine is [Sweet Tooth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Tooth_(Vertigo\)). The art seems a bit strange at first, but i really learned to love the style. The author (Jeff Lemire) drawed it himself.

[Watchmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen) is indeed a very essential read!

if you are interested in superhero stuff there's a lot more to recommend. Like.. [The Long Halloween](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Long_Halloween), the [Sinestro Corps War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinestro_Corps_War) or [Hawkeye Vol. 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics\)#Collected_editions), to name a few of my favorites.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","&gt;The waves from Queensland will rock the federal ship. Federal LNP backbencher Jane Prentice was blunt. “We need to take lessons,” she said. “We can’t continue as we are”.

&gt;Prentice said that last week she had told Abbott – who has been ringing around the backbench in recent days – that “you are not taking the people with you; we are not explaining why we are doing things”.

No, Jane, that's not it. When will you guys get the simple fact that it's NOT that you're not explaining why you're doing things that we don't like. It's the ACTUAL THINGS YOU'RE TRYING TO DO that we don't like.

When you have a tin-eared government who is so completely insensitive to what their electorates want, what alternative is there to voting them out with a massive swing? We're trying to tell you via the polls that we don't like what you're doing. Why aren't you listening?

There was a poll on one of the front page articles yesterday asking the question ""If an election was held today, would you vote for Tony Abbott's government again?"" The answer was no, and the percentage of noes was more than 86%. That is staggering.

 But besides that, Power metal has a lot of diverse sounds, it's not all like [Freedom Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8N58--6blA) (not that theres anything wrong with Freedom Call, I actually really like them)

"zen","t5_2qhmf","This is an article about standardizing Dogen Buddhism in the West, so it doesn't have anything to do with Zen.  If Dogen Buddhism gets standardized then it will be much simpler to illustrate how it is not Zen since there will be wide agreement among Dogen Buddhists about their religion.

As a side note, I would point out that is some history of evangelical Soto priests coming to the West because they argued that Japanese Buddhists weren't dedicated enough to Zazen prayer meditation and were too committed to ritual and ceremony.  Given that, and that the Critical Buddhism movement with Dogen Buddhism isn't particularly enamoured of the Easter Dogen churches as things stand now, I expect that in the long term Dogen Buddhism will continue to fragment and produce a series of churches with subtle and occasionally not so subtle differences.","1422749338"
"headphones","t5_2rcyx","Precise positional audio is great for FPS games, but it's not going to suddenly convert you from a noob hell-bent on suicide into some kind of a competitive FPS demigod. 

If you don't understand the concept of cover, or of mobility, and most importantly of not running out into the open when under fire, you are gonna die quickly no matter what headphones and positional audio you use.

Having said this, IMO a good pair of headphones gives you some advantages in *soundstage* and thus in *positional cues*. 

If you are the kind of competitive gamer who will benefit from this legal advantage, then your best bet is to find a pair of open headphones with the widest soundstage you can for your budget.

 Beyond that, virtual sound processing gives you only a minor advantage, *if* it is set up appropriately, over plain ol' stereo (which IMO is the way the gods intended us to game!)","1422749338"

Section 2. [**Nieuport 16**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuport_11#Nieuport_16) of article  [**Nieuport 11**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuport%2011): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In 1916 an improved version appeared as the Nieuport 16 which was a strengthened Nieuport 11 airframe powered by a 110 hp (92 kW) [Le Rhône 9J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Rh%C3%B4ne_9J) rotary engine.  Visible differences included a larger aperture in front of the ""horse shoe"" cowling and a headrest for the pilot.  Later versions had a fuselage-mounted synchronized Vickers gun, but in this configuration the combined effect of the heavier 9J engine and the Vickers gun compromised maneuverability  and made the craft nose-heavy. The next variant, the slightly larger __[Nieuport 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuport_17) C.1__, was designed for the heavier engine and machine gun with a new, full-perimeter ring cowl, and remedied the 16's [c.g.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass) problems, as well as improving performance.

The appeal of of a highly-capable 3D printer (or eventually a full blown nanofactory) is that one factory can print out a hundred more factories that can then be distributed to anyone.

Reddit hears a quote and then drills it into the ground to the point where I don't even associate it with the person who coined it but rather with the average redditor who I dont particulalry look up to in any way.

Like thre was a time when ""*This too Shall Pass*"" was a jewish proverb or whatever. Now I just remember all the times I've heard redditors mention it in relation to finals week or a breakup.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","No stupid questions, just stupid premises that often come with questioning political correctness.

For instance, ""Why do so many women make false rape allegations?"" This isn't PC, and the question's very structure is faulty because it assumes that many women make fake allegations without any such proof. It leads the question with a false--or very shaky--premise, really. 

And so it goes for a number of things that question political correctness. Other examples:

""Where can I find *true* figures of Holocaust deaths?"" (the false premise being that most/all figures are fabricated or exacerbated).

""How did Jews come to run the media?"" (stupid premise being that they do, and the question is therefore how).

""Why do black men engage in crime?"" (stupid premise being that if you're black, your motivation is automatically different than a white person's). 

Other PC-dissecting questions may be rooted in ignorance and--I know how much the Reddit community just loves this word--privilege. For example:

""I don't mind being called cracker, so why can't I call black people n***ers?"" To ask this question is to show ignorance as to how this word was repeatedly used in a derogatory fashion to keep a minority feeling oppressed and disenfranchised. It makes the assumption that one racial epithet is equivalent to another, despite ""cracker"" never holding anywhere near the same power, intention, or emotional charge. 

Another example: ""why don't women who want to avoid rape just dress more conservatively?"" This shows ignorance of how most rape crimes happen (the rapist knows the victim personally), and privilege because it doesn't question changing a man's behavior while also alluding to the fact that men have the luxury of wearing whatever they want without the same fear of safety.  

Anyway, these are just a few examples. While I know one could say, ""but unbiased, objective statistics support many of these premises,"" one should also question how cultural/environmental factors formulate them in the first place--ie, racial profiling, hiring discrimination, etc.","1422749340"

I often only take a history for the therapeutic effect of it, because I can usually tell within one minute of the child coming into the office if he or she has ADHD. Usually, the door flies open, the child runs in, and within 30 seconds, he or she is literally breakdancing on the floor while rapidly reciting some song and won't respond the first 3 times their mother calls them. Five different toys will be grabbed and strewn everywhere within seconds of each other, yet the child won't actually play with any of them for longer than a minute. It's absolutely a real problem. The issue is when it's lumped with (or aggravated by) behavioural problems and/or learning disabilities. ADHD meds will fix or improve ADHD, but they won't negate years of zero positive reinforcement from the parents or fix the child's dyslexia. ","1422749340"

Yes, but I was distinguishing between evidence and legal rules. Facts vs law, so not meaning evidential matters of law, but factual matters of proof i.e. did X or Y actually happen, not is X or Y the legal rule pertaining to admissibility of evidence and the like.

&gt; legal interpretation by judges is often not formalistic

I am agreeing with you. I am merely also saying that in my experience the approaches to the reasoning in the reports at the higher end of the spectrum are generally more formalistic *when setting out, identifying and analysing the relevant law* but not always when *applying* it to a given case. This is regardless of whether the matter is especially controversial or is of special public interest.

&gt; You can't do away with figuring out what past case law has said.

Of course not, the point is how much emphasis you place on it (e.g. priorities and starting points) and the manner in which it is analysed -- you can analyse formalistically and still come to the conclusion that it needs to be changed. I guess I don't see them as strictly mutually exclusive paths.

People here are overthinking about is something is cut or included. 

The showrunners were told about the ending. I am unsure of how people are not seeing what the showrunners are doing by now. They are changing the show to fit theIr idea of the story, doing any adding or subtracting of plots at their own whim, and I believe that their only contractual obligation is to show the ending in how GRRM has envisioned it. As long as they don't screw that up they will do whatever they want with the show. 

I think people need to take a step back and compare the show and the books and see that the show is tearing apart the books to get to the end quicker for 7 seasons and not omitting plots because they aren't important.

Then you should realize that there's no reason to focus on her at all. Focus on you and making sure you do honorable things. Focus on the ""do"" part of that last sentence - you can change your actions a lot easier than you can change your emotions.

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","The 'long time' here was referring to time, not chapters. Spending chapter 3 giving him all the EXP is possible, but it takes a long time.

You're giving him an entire chapter of EXP, in lieu of training up your other characters, who aside from Seth are all also not that strong just yet. In return, you get someone who ends up comparable to your other characters after he promotes. You also are required to grind to do this, which is a downside since it means slow play.

For comparisons purpose, instead of funneling an entire chapter's EXP into Ross, do the same into Garcia and see how he turns out. Or do the same with Franz. Or really anyone else. You're likely to be surprised at how good they end up.

Saying he gets promotion gains twice is misleading. His promotion gains to Pirate/Fighter are small, only about 2-3 levels worth of stats. What matters is how well he compares in combat to other characters, and that's where he falls down.

He was quiet, would play cards with us, read, but not much else.  Kept to himself.  Some of the guys on the unit, members of a certain gang, saw this as weakness.  Started with little comments to fuck with him, bullying bullshit.  Then one day something of his goes missing, I forget what it was, and he remains quiet.  I and some other dudes on the unit talk to him and are like listen they are gonna take everything, do you need some help, we can work it out and back you up.  He says no, its fine.  Next day he comes into his cell to see one of the guys from that gang taking some of his instant coffee.  I didn't see it happen but saw the aftermath and heard the eyewitness account.  This 60 something old man whooped a 20 something year old kid built like a football player into the ground.  I heard that he immediately 3 pieced this kid, twice under the ribs and once to the head and dropped him, then mounted a ground and pound and fucked this dude up.  The quietest, most reserved guy on the unit.  Turns out that, as a younger man, he was a pretty decent boxer and wasn't the type to run his mouth about anything but made his point when he had to.

When I eat shrooms I need at least 2 g's to get visual distortions/color enhancements.  3g's to ""trip"" and 5g's to have a strong experience.  With the shrooms I have tried, obviously.

Maybe you're just a hard head?  what was your dose this time?

Anyway: weed intensifies quite a few drugs, and people often report being ""brought back up""  so it's weird, but not unheard of for weed to make you trip when you weren't before.  It's definitely odd, as you should have just been in a kinda ""afterglow"" stage, but maybe you smoked a lot or it was strong weed or whatever, and that was sufficient. Try smoking a bowl right after ingesting the shrooms next time maybe?","1422749343"
"programming","t5_2fwo","I still think asm would have provided bountiful opportunities for programming abstraction. I envisioned layers of code-generation. Meta-assembly built up over years. Or ""Lisp-of-asm"". What derailed this was the desire for portability and future-proofing against architecture changes (hey, DEC Alpha seemed promising...). (More recently I've considered this again, with LLVM... but now I'm too lazy.)

I agree that dataflow is powerful, but I've never seen the merit of trying to make things into nontextual graphs because the overhead always seems too heavy -- for creation *and* inspection/comprehension. The real limit of textual is that it's essentially a 1D stream. But this constraint also simplifies the expression of most common cases.

For your final example of a dataflow diagram... well, wouldn't something like this be quite a sensible and succinct?

    text |&gt; parse
         |&gt; slice_words maxlen
         |&gt; manufacture_lines maxlen
         |&gt; assemble_text

This could be OCaml, SML, F#, or similar in Haskell... and the OOP/imperative languages might have their own variation with dots and parens.

The key thing is that *thinking* of the problem from a dataflow perspective can lead to independent subfunctions which can be connected together. And this can help regardless of the language/expression. Unix pipes, man.","1422749343"

Rebuild your decks from the ground up if you have to, but keep trying. Try new combos, experiment with different synergies, maybe buy a few card packs. Nobody gets to Legend without pouring themselves into the game, and not everyone has that kind of time. All you have to worry about is how you feel about your own rank. Don't let anyone tell you that you did poorly for being rank 17. You did what you could with what you had, and next season you are gonna blast through the lower ranks so hard that the players you wiped the floor with will remember your name for as long as they play the game.

&gt; See world history for evidence.

Yeah, when will you capitalists understand that capitalism will only end in death and misery? Have you not heard of the Reign of Terror?

&gt; 1) The shoe doesn't exist UNLESS I put the $3 capital at risk. That means the job for the worker doesn't exist UNLESS I put the $3 capital at risk.

You are here explaining how capitalism works, not justifying it. In the real world, however, work doesn't rely on 'jobs'. The work on the shoe can still be done. The difference between capitalism and socialism is that in capitalism you have to go to the boss to do the work, except that you don't get the products of your labour, only exchange-value in the form of money. We've already noted that the exchange value you are given is less than what you create.

&gt; 2) Need I remind you that the worker invested NOTHING in this scenario except labor? Without me risking the $3, the worker has no possibility of making the shoe and the $1, unless he invests the money himself. If the worker invests the $3 himself, then I suppose he becomes the exploiter? How would the worker ""have added $2 exchange value"" if I hadn't risked the $3?

Again, you are explaining the way capitalism works. This isn't a justification. Yes, the worker is unable to work in capitalism unless you exploit them. In a socialist system, the worker does not have to go through the owner and his exploitation in order to create the shoe.

&gt; 3)

More explanation, no justification. You're not understanding that a capitalist system and a socialist one are completely different.

&gt; The worker also has to be paid BEFORE the shoe is sold

Yet after the labour has been completed. If the capitalist then finds out he can't pay the worker, well, the labour's been completed already. So actually some of the risk is externalised onto the worker.","1422749345"

[A mangy QPR forum...](http://www.wearetherangersboys.com/forum/showthread.php?185865-Just-Back-Fairly-Positive)

[A slightly more upmarket forum...](http://loftforwords.fansnetwork.co.uk/forum/137732/just-back/#3) 

Edit: [And this one from the same place...](http://loftforwords.fansnetwork.co.uk/forum/137699/infighting-(/#21)

And finally, [this depressing report from a sane but smaller forum](http://www.qprdot.org/viewtopic.php?t=75402&amp;sid=fac293138498fcaecdb8815200ac43d0).

I'm a ST holder but the third report sums up why I am not really a fan of QPR away days. There are too many angry, agressive, pissed-up, coked up dickheads among the travelling QPR support. Not overwhelming numbers, but enough to cause hassle.
 
I've only done Southampton, Chelsea and Arsenal this year. Southampton was OK, although there was one punch-up. Chelsea was pretty good, with everyone's focus being pretty square on the matter at hand (the simple task of out-singing Chelsea supporters) and by the Arsenal Boxing Day match everyone seemed to have resigned themselves to losing away. It's QPR though, and although 11 straight away defeats is abysmal, this is still a relatively small club and few people here are under any illusions as to what are realistic expectations for a Premier League campaign.

I'm a little bit surprised there are still teams around us that we can leapfrog to get out of the bottom three with a win or two.","1422749347"

It was a combination of severed columns (leading to higher loads than designed)+ fire weakening the steel's expect strength.  Also buildings aren't made out of one piece of steel, it was the bolted connections between truss members that failed first.

Being a single mother is hard work and it sounds like your mom put her heart into that job and was quite successful in raising a level headed and kind hearted child. It's great to read that the man she is engaged to is a good example of what a Muslim man should be. I've read too many stories where that wasn't the case. You and your mom should definitely learn about Islam. Try and take classes at an Islamic center or mosque if you can. One thing I would caution you about is making sure you both understand the difference between Islam and whatever his cultural practices are. I don't know what country he is from but oftentimes the cultural practices heavily influence how a person practices the religion, and they sometimes contradict one another. There are many online resources you can look into. Some good sites for English speakers are www.Islamicity.com and www.Peacetv.tv and www.Guideus.tv this site even has an app you can get free.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Eh, you can look it up on most dog breeds if you want your own citation. When I got my Husky, my neighbor started some shit because ""Siberian Huskies are a dangerous breed."" Well, they are on the list, same reason German Shepards are, because they have pointy ears and through the eyes of a 9 year old, look like a wolf. But I was reading the statistics on why exactly they were considered violent. It's mostly due to mixed breeds. And you can raise any dog to be violent, and shithole people in the ghetto that don't train their dogs properly tend to own pits and rots. What percentage of pit bulls raised in a proper environment are responsible for the fatalities? Mine attacked 3 that had it coming to them, story is in this thread somewhere, it was justified, even the judge agreed on two out of 3 and it went to jury trial on the last. Me being a kid at the time, never knew what came of the third but I still had my dog and I didn't care. But he never even came close to killing them. How many of the dogs were never put into a situation where they even had to act? My grandpa has one now and he lives in BFE, pretty sure his dog has met about 10 people in its entire life due to being in such a remote area.  
  
I'm high as fuck and went off track, but either way. A lot of reasoning for dogs being on the dangerous breed list and/or being considered dangerous is because of mix breeds. So if my Husky was mixed with a pit and it bit someone, it'd be placed on both lists, so the list becomes skewed. They don't know what breed caused them to attack so they just blame both. Sort of like everyone did to North Korea, no one knew who hacked Sony, so they just blamed North Korea because what the fuck are they going to do about it? Nothing.","1422749352"

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","My last one was quite an adventure I'll tell you. Depression+anxiety+low self esteem+anorexia/bulimia with the latter two developing about 7 months into our 11month relationship. You wouldn't even recognise her as an INTJ. We had a lot of common interests and stuff but part way in it just turned into me thinking ""I can help her I'm strong."" Taught me a valuable life lesson that I should always put my own interests ahead of others. Extremely clingy, she wouldn't leave me alone for one second of the day. Always texting and if I didn't respond shed say I didn't love her and would threaten suicide. I let myself be bullied around so much because I thought I could save her. She'd psychologically torment me and even hit me a few times. I was such a fucking tool. Only got through due to massive help from my very close ENTJ friend who could see through her bullshit and defend me. Ofc shed try to get sympathy but eventually it worked and I started to lose feelings for her. I started to confront her and call her out on her stupid shit. Eventually whenever she would say ""go away"" I did just that instead of trying to talk to her. So funny how shed suddenly would become very mild and soft after I threatened any action. Summer came along and she went from like 56kg to under 40. Her temperament improved massively but the damage was done. I eventually lost all feelings for her and less than 4 weeks before our 1 year anniversary I sat her down and explained to her we are incompatible romantically and that I'm terminating the relationship  (not exact words.) She went off crying and said she didn't want to be friends. I just lol'ed and sure enough she came crawling back. I explained to her I had no issue being friends but showed zero emotion. Next week she was in psych ward as her weight reached critical point and an ambulance had to take her away. The following month without her was a period of rejuvenation where I turned back into the easy going, flirtatious guy whom everyone got along with, that I was before her. I regret nothing as this was so incredibly meaningful to me. You wouldn't believe some of the shit I had to go through. We still remain friends to this day but I'm very cautious where I dip my toes.

A faded red '67 Chevy pickup rumbles into view and quickly away into the distance.

A rugged but clean Jesse Pinkman places his cigarette in his mouth to lean across the seat and grab a small blue notepad with an address written on it.

The truck pulls into a small rural neighborhood and up to a relatively new house. Getting out of the truck, Jesse is greeted by a nice Hispanic man.

""Jesse, good to see you again. Thank you for coming over."" They shake hands. ""This damn porch is falling apart on us."" The truck door closes to reveal a ""Pinkman Carpentry"" logo. 

Brock runs from the house letting the screen slam behind him.

""Tio Manuel, can I help uncle Jesse work on the porch??"" Manuel looking at Jesse: ""What do you say?""

Jesse smiles at Brock: ""Well I've still got plenty to teach you if you're going to be my partner one day, don't I?""

A long white corridor

Walter White approaches in khakis and a white collared shirt. He carries a light blue spiral bound notebook. He turns and enters a door to his left, and a room full of men in Orange jumpsuits looks up at him. 

He stares for a moment before making his way to the front of the room, followed by 30 sets of eyes. He turns and faces the room, dropping his notebook down on a small table with a light smack

On the front of the notebook is a white label printed with: ""White, Walter: NM/DC10079 Correctional GED Instructor""

Natürlich werden sie schon an mehrere potentielle Sponsoren herangetreten sein, aber das erste was die sehen wollen bevor sie auch nur daran denken das scheckheft zu zücken sind Zahlen Zahlen Zahlen. Wieviele views, welche Zielgruppe, wie lange wird der Stream geschaut ect., hinzu kommen dann noch kurz und mittelfristige Prognosen und Marktanalysen und und und. 
Zwei Wochen auf Sendung wird wohl kaum reichen um große Unternehmen dazu zu bringen in die Taschen zu greifen.
Ich glaube mitbekommen zu haben dass die Bohnen die ersten zwei Monate als Pilotprojekt ansehen, mit dem dann die Zukunft des Senders beworben werden soll.

Wir als Zuschauer sehen nicht was hinter der Bühne alles läuft, aber ich denke wir können davon ausgehen dass die Bohnen solche offensichtlichen Chancen selbst erkennen. Dass nach drei Wochen schon der erste Großsponsor spendabel wird ist doch wohl utopisch.

Das gleiche gilt für technische Probleme. Beispielsweise ein fehlender Sendeplan zum Senderstart heißt doch selbstverständlich nicht dass die Bohnen nich nicht selbst auf die Idee gekommen sind einen Sendeplan zu erstellen, sondern dass dies zunächst einfach noch nicht realisierbar war.

Habt doch einfach ein Bisschen mehr Geduld, die Bohen machen Woche für Woche Fortschritte was Technik, Ablauf und Kommunikation angeht, Kinderkrankheiten und Vorlaufzeiten lassen sich nun mal nicht vermeiden.

Also bitte... Geduld haben, auf die Bohnen vertrauen und fleißig Supporten, dann werden die Jungs das schon schaukeln

&gt; Hydroxylammonium nitrate molecule (NH3OHNO3) is a nontoxic dense energetic ionic liquid

Although then again, the actual chemical page lists it as:

&gt; Toxic, carcinogenic, explosive, harmful, an irritant, dangerous to the environment.

:/. So what's the truth? Any hypergolic fuel by its nature is likely going to be explosive/flammable, so that shouldn't be considered an inherent disadvantage though. 

&gt; And you need rare and expensive metals like platinum or iridium to catalyse its decomposition.

This seems like a big downside. Can't you recover catalysts though? My high school chem classes always told me that they could be infinitely reused. In the case of Dragon, this could be useful. Not so much for expendable satellites (high powered Hall effect Argon (read: cheaper than Xenon) thrusters seems like the best approach for expendable applications though).

Today peasants can move around the world while leaders and groundbreakers explore the heavens and depths of watery hells.

"Battlefield_4_CTE","t5_35x9r","XM-25 does better suit the Assault class, for two reasons:

1) Better suits the class role
2) Assault can't ressuply their own Airburst, they need ammunition

The problem with giving very powerful items (as they were on launch) like Airburst, UCAV, C4 to the support class, is that they can ressupply themselves.  So you would get UCAVs spammed, Airburst spammed, and you still get C4 spammed in CQ maps.

DICE realised their mistake and were forced into some big nerfs on the Airburst and the UCAV.  They should have seen the problem coming -- the combination of ammo bag + a powerful gadget.  

It's a crisis of class roles brought on by gadgets.  The Assault class is also broken, because it shouldn't have the medkit.  The medic class must be brought back for the next Battlefield.  Then you can have the aggressive and powerful Assault class (assault rifles), who can't heal or revive and a separate slightly less powerful (carbines and shotguns) medic class.

If the Support can resupply their own gadgets, the gadgets must be well balanced.  The UCAV, Airburst and C4 were not well balanced and that is why the nerfs keep coming.   C4 resupply time should be next, it's horribly abused by Support players.

DICE should be buffing MP-APS at the same time they do these nerfs, and thinking of new ""Support orientated"" gadgets instead of vehicle killing and spam gadgets.

The key problem with the UCAV is that it completely removes the **skill contest** from the game and has **no counters**.  You can't do that in an FPS, which is primarily about skill contests and rock/paper/scissors. To  then take this imbalanced item and put it in the hands of a class that can resupply itself, it's sheer madness.","1422749368"

According to my mom he was just absolutely in love with her and my mom said she was just an awesome person and everyone liked her. From what I remember of the story, they were heading to visit my grandma and on the way he proposed to her. They were taking pictures on a guard rail that was next to a cliff down to a river. I guess she was sitting on it and shifted her position for a different pose and fell backward down into the river below. He dove in after her and drifted down stream for miles looking for her. After searching for a while he hiked to the nearest town (which I guess was like 20 miles away) he called the cops, my mom, and my grandma and told them what happened. I'm not sure if they ever found her body or not, my mom told me this story like 10 years ago and no one in the family talks about it.

The stadium it replaced, the RCA Dome, will not be paid off until 2021, even though it has already been torn down. There were also financing issues that led to significant cost overruns, so the city decided to help fix the funding issues by reducing art and cultural investments, along other cuts. It should be noted that the city tried to renegotiate their contract with Colts owner Jim Irsay, but he refused.

Finally, it's not just Indianapolis that pays for it, the surrounding counties recieved tax increases as well. And I dont think I'm going out on a limb by saying that some of the more rural counties did not recieve as much of an economic boost as Marion County . I should note that this last point is anecdotal, since it's based on growing up in Boone. Strangely, it always seemed as though local residents would agree to sacrifice their firstborn child if it meant keeping the Colts in town.","1422749372"

Especially since the SAS rebuttal was so... easy compared to the CB post and easily came across as the correct one. Analysing a subreddit that is openly circlejerky is also a waste of time anyway.

&gt;I really find nationalism fascinating and I'd love to chew over the weird things that it does to people's minds but these threads aren't really the place for it. I wouldn't go so far as to take them down, but I agree with you that it's more petty popcorn entertainment than anything of real substance or insight.

While CB may not be the best place to properly analyse stuff its more entertaining when its done well or about a more conflicting jerk. At the moment CB only upvotes posts with views it agrees with and seems to have forgotten the whole ""not all jerks are bad"" thing and more emotive ""DAE LE RODDIT IS EVIL"" get right to the top.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Allow me to share my views, while emphasizing that they are my own and not necessarily standard.

1) You are right. Times were different then, and the Bible is coloured by the social conditions of the time during which it was written. Another important aspect of Christianity, in my opinion, is that the New Testament has precedence over the Old Testament. Jesus said to love your neighbor like you love yourself. It's as simple as that.

It is important, I think, to realize that the Bible cannot be interpreted literally. If you look into its history, you will see why this is the case. Countless copies, revisions, alterations and copying errors have made it impossible to know to what degree the texts in the Bible, especially the Old Testament, have been altered since the original texts were written. This fact rules out the position of the Bible as the definitive word of God.

In my pracice of Christianity, I treat the Bible as an *approximation* of God and a record of how people have thought about God throughout history, and use this to shape my own faith.

As for the proper hermaneutics of that passage, someone more knowlegable will have to answer. My point is that just because the Bible says it, doesn't make it absolute. Christianity has evolved with the times and with its followers, and now has no problem with homosexuality.

2) I feel like I am constantly hitting this wall you describe. I think it is related to our original sin. See point 3.

3) Baptism is not your acceptance of God, but God making a promise to you and initiating a relationship with you. Your relationship with Him has already been initiated and God will never break His promise, so a second baptism in not needed and in fact an insult to God. We all struggle with our faith, and we doubt the sincerity of our dicipleship to Jesus Christ. It is standard teaching, as far as I know, that God has given you the gift of faith. However, we are slaves to sin, and everything we do and are is dirtied with sin, so we are unable to accept God's love for what it is. So we will never feel ""ready"" in the way you describe.","1422749376"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The answer from another thread that I wrote.

**Georgia: A southern state without the southern hospitality.**

First it is the weather, only state where it can be freezing cold one week in January but humid hot the next, then back to being freezing cold. Summers are very hot and humid but that seems to be the case with most southern states.

Now lets get to the people and other parts of the state itself. Imagine a southern state without the southern hospitality but with all of the cons that come with living in the south. Outside of some popular tourist spots such as Savannah, the people of Georgia carry the cocky and elitist demeanor that southerners accuse ""yankees"" of having, it is the worst there than anywhere else I have witnessed. Imagine being stuck in a dumb flat and boring state populated with some of the most shallow, snobby, and elitist people the country has to offer. Feels like this state is divided into a giant countryclub on one end full of old money types, nascar/redneck crowd on the other, and the inner city/urban crowd to finish it all out (Atlanta has one of the most popular hip hop scenes). Outside of Atlanta, the state is mostly ghettos and trailer parks everywhere.

The people here are quite passionate about their sports but all of the teams here for the most part suck, many people are frustrated by it. Georgia has an inferiority complex to the state of Florida for many reasons. One of the reasons is that Florida is better at sports, especially college football, a sport that is a religion in Georgia. Florida also offers some of the best vacation spots in the south, college kids in Georgia try their best to head to Florida for a vacation.

More on the inferiority complex, people of GA hate that nobody in the country really cares about them. GA is one of those states that you ignore for the most part and the people here hate that.

People say New Jersey and NYC suck because of the people, fair enough, but at least there is a lot to do in those areas. Others say that Nebraska and Montana suck because there is nothing to do, fair enough, but at least you meet good people there. Georgia has the worst of both worlds.


**That said, other southern states can be alright places to live. Florida gets a lot of hate but it has its good parts with a lot of variety and I have met kind and hospitable people in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. Georgia is practically the worst of all the southern states when it comes to people, they give blue blooded families in New England a run for their money when it comes to being snobs that look down on everyone that isn't them.**","1422749379"

The passage from the Grey Annals reads:
&gt;And they appeared again unlooked for in Doriath, and those that saw them were both glad and fearful. But Luthien went to Menegroth and healed the winter of Thingol with the touch of her hand; yet Melian looked in her eyes and read the doom that was written there, and turned away: for she knew that a parting beyond the end of the World had come between them, and no grief of loss hath been heavier than the grief of the heart of Melian Maia in that hour (unless only it were the grief of Elrond and Arwen).

From what CT says in Book 5 of HoME, it sounds like the published Silmarillion text here is a combination of the 1937 Quenta Silmarillion and the Grey Annals, so the odd punctuation may be due to CT's editorial combination of the two.","1422749383"

Dachau was a special camp for political prisoners, not a death camp either. Death camps only existed in the eastern parts of the 3rd Reich and occupied Poland.

German newspapers are reporting that the used buildings in Schwerte used to be the living quarters of the SS guards.

Other sports where players make millions have had issues with match fixing just because it's possible and just because it's easy doesn't make it right nor does it detract from the fact that these organizations should have a means of protecting themselves from this type of issue similarly to how organizations can prosecute in other major sports.

Naturally, they are going to discuss their thoughts. There is nothing ""despicable"" going on here. No one here has the power to ruin anyone on your list, and you know that. 

If you were truly interested in the subject of unwarranted and disconcerting character assassination, you would have eliminated all mention of this mythical, monolithic ""pro Adnan"" camp and included Rabia, Susan Simpson, Colin, Asia, and anyone else who routinely gets berated by reddit personalities on your victims list. But you did not do that because your goal is not ""passionate debate""or protecting poor vulnerable children like Kevin Urick. Your goal is to attack others and position your side as morally superior, when it isn't. 

Personally, I don't think these ""camps"" are even real. I believe the majority of the people just want the truth. They just believe different narratives of what the truth is. So what?

You're on top of everything that's normally recommended, and even the ideas I don't normally think of that I threw at you (besides mixing an oil). I just find it strange that varying foundation types don't seem to help, and that mattifying products on the oily areas makes it worse. The latter somewhat makes sense.. only suggestion there is to go with normal skin type products overall, and you'll have to blot the oily areas. This is, of course, referring to the situation after you find a foundation that works for you.

I will say I really love UD Naked Skin, it's the top voted comment in this thread as well. I have normal skin and I really, really love this foundation and find it flexible in coverage and ability to be built up. I hope you find something that works! I'm sorry you're having this problem.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","&gt;Phase vs Treads

Personal preference. Phase gives you more mobility, and extra damage for farming with split shot.

Treads scales better, and tread switching reduce the net mana cost of snakes (due to the mana return).

&gt;Item

Aquila, (Bottle), Boots of choice

Pick one of the three ultimate orb item: Manta/Skadi/Linkens.

Get a damage item. Yasha, Crystalis, HoTD, Demon Edge, sometimes Maelstrom (avoid if possible. It isn't as good on Medusa due to split shot and Stone Gaze).

Do you need more damage? Upgrade the small damage item/get another small damage item. Keep Yasha and HoTD as it is, Manta/Satanic aren't very good early game.

Do you need more survivability? Work on another Ultimate Orb item.

Bit of both? Butterfly

Rinse and repeat. You'll generally want 1 damage for 1 survivability, since the traditional Linkens Manta Skadi Butterfly hits like a wet noodle. People will just focus your team if they're competent. 

Your 6 slot generally is:

Travels Skadi Butterfly Rapier MKB/Manta/BKB/Satanic/Bloodstone/Daedelus/Linkens/Skadi/Rapier (two of these. The second skadi/rapier is not a typo)

In base defence, you can drop your travels for another item, be sure to remember to put it back on during pushes, unless you have a kotl that can summon you back

Some notes:

* If going Manta, it'll usually be the first item you drop for a better one. It doesn't scale very well on Medusa (who prefers raw damage due to split shot). Keep it against silence, or for dodging projectiles, but most of the time it'll be the first to go.

* If you're not dying, Rapier is a valid item option. Split shot is a 480% damage increase, so a rapier is going to give you 1440 damage per wave of shots. Medusa is a tanky monster, so you're not likely to drop it.

* Keep a refresher orb in the stash ultra late game. You can refresh boots of travel, BKB and Stone Gaze with it. Never buy back without BoT to make it back into the fight, and Stone Gaze/BKB to win the fight.","1422749388"

"oneplus","t5_30qnb","if you're trying to figure out how to set up a longer exposure you just have to go to the settings (sliders icon) and change the slow shutter speed to whatever you like. As long as whatever you like consists of Auto, 1/2, 1, 2 4, &amp; 8 seconds. 

This changes the slow shutter, shutter speed. You then need to change the mode (swipe up on camera viewfinder till you get to the slow shutter mode) then take a shot.

Other ways to take longer exposures involve other 3rd party apps, I use camera FV-5 which allows exposures up to 60 minutes.

If you want longer exposure of day light scenes, like water moving people etc make for trippy images. You need a filter of some kind, usually you can just use a super dark but transparent film over the lens.

I don't know if this answers your questions?

If that slow shutter option isn't in your camera, you may need to allow it to appear by tapping the O on the camera side bar and toggle the slow shutter option on.

Hope it helps.","1422749391"

Yes, but also the assassination of the President of Ecuador.

&gt;Considering the Freemasons had been long around before that without much issue, and were later targeted by the Nazis and Mussolini (who were tacitly supported by the Catholic Church) for being a political organization seems to contradict your claim that it's a violent religion.

The idea that the Nazis were supported by the Catholic Church is so utterly far from the truth it's barely worth a response. I have a copypasta if I must use it.

Mussolini and the Church did not get along especially well, either, Pope Pius IX's social encyclicals did not mesh with fascist thought and Mussolini blew a gasket.

One of the popular powerlifting eBooks sheds a light as to why these professionals use 65% of their 1RM for several weeks. It is because those are the weeks when they are off of their cycle. The heavy weights that they put down as their 1RMs are *enhanced*. So when they are off of their cycle they aren't really lifting 65%, they're lifting 85-90% of what their body can naturally lift.

For a natural novice or intermediate to use 65% of their 1RM is an absolute joke. People should be aware of the information they are reading.","1422749392"

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","&gt; The fact that it's difficult to catch players match fixing who do it correctly isn't an argument against an organization protecting itself against players who throw a match. 

I am not arguing against organisations protecting themselves against players who match fix. I am saying that it is impossible to catch match fixers who are careful. What you are talking about and what I am talking about are two completely different things.

&gt; But steel even said himself that part of their rational in even deciding to throw was that nothing would happen to them even if they got caught.

That is because, in Valve's 18-some-odd years, they have never done anything like they have done last Monday. This includes when there was matchfixing in Dota 2.

&gt; It's not about preventing throwing it's about protecting these brands and giving them the ability to prosecute an individual who does get caught.

That is a false dichotomy. Both aspects are very important.

&gt; Just because it's hard to catch someone doing it doesn't mean this won't at the very least make a team think twice before deciding to throw a match.

The opposite can be easily said. Because it is so easy to not get caught, players can consider match fixing

&gt; Professional athletes paid millions have been caught up in match fixing it's no surprise that some CSGO pros are going to get in on whatever little action they can.

Well, it actually is surprising, because like I said, Valve has never done anything like what they did last week, including when match fixing occurred in Dota 2.

&gt; The difference is when you're caught throwing in a more established sport not only do you get a life time ban but you're subject to legal action by the organizations you've damaged and can even get some jail time for it. These punishments don't prevent match fixing but they justly punish those who are involved.

Again I never made any point against stricter repercussions for match fixing, all I said is that it is extremely easy to commit match fixing and ensure that you won't get caught.

"paradoxplaza","t5_2su3h","I would like to see a game that picks up after HOI4, and carries on to 2100.  They way that Paradox would make this game interesting is by assuming the world we live in is *not* the normal.  The game should assume the world we live in is the ""brightest timeline.""  So after WWII, there should be some kind of Cold War event that could stay normal... or it could break out into a conventional tankin' and battleshipin' war with a gentleman's agreement not to nuke it up...  One that you could break or at least threaten to break.  In my perfect game, all points forward would allow us or the AI to make the ""darkest timeline"" decisions like torpedoing ships during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a junta rising in a post-Soviet Russia (or post democratic US) and selling warheads almost randomly...  Things like Federalizing Europe (or SE Asia... or North America) with a Vici2 sort of political party system could be a lot of fun... doubly so if political parties could become non-state, multinational actors...  Then you could simulate things like ""Suomensuko Taliban"" or ""Zunist ISIS"" and you could have the nation you founded in 697 fighting the central asian reindeer men that bought a nuke from the former Persian-Soviet nation.  
  
I think there's a lot of fun to be had in a modern and future game, but it has to assume we're the best possible timeline, or damn near the best, and that a ""normal"" would would be much dark and much more EU4/Vic2 business as usual.","1422749397"

Most are vascular in nature, caused by miss-formed blood vessels just under the skin... some are pigmented, caused by the clustering of pigment cells on the skin.

Nobody really knows what the causes of birthmarks are. Experts say that vascular birthmarks are not hereditary. Birthmarks are less common in Asian people, compared to individuals from other parts of the world.

An over-accumulation of cells that make up the lining of the baby's blood vessels are believed to cause the development of strawberry marks. In some cases, experts believe that a tiny piece of placenta may have got lodged inside the developing embryo very early during pregnancy.

You're a dude of an age with some chronic health problems, no car, a smoking habit, and some financial troubles. Then ask yourself what you can fix right now. Pick something. anything. clean your room. brush your teeth. anything. and then pick something else. and keep doing that and you'll discover that you learn to appreciate the suffering of wanting something like a cigarette and not giving it to yourself. You'll thank god you're having headaches and poor sleep, because discomfort equals progress... and then when you're 28, you won't even recognize who you were, and that's a beautiful thing.

Yolo: You are maybe in college taking a gap year. You want to get to every famous place once for a picture, and then get to a pub to get drunk. You will party until morning, get poured on a bus, and do it again. 

Classic: A drink is fun, but you are a serious traveller, 21-50, there to experience the destination. You don't mind enduring a bit of a bumpy ride to get there. There's no sense in paying $50 for a comfortable seat if the same $50 will get you a day deeper into the jungle.

Just learn to love the skin you're in and you will be fine.  I think you're definitely above average at the moment, and the older you get, the more you will grow into your looks.  You don't look that thin in your pictures, I think you look pretty healthy!  If you're looking to boost your attractiveness maybe play around with makeup a bit.

[Dust](https://archive.org/details/swizzle_demu_DUST), A Point and Click Wild West game I remember playing.

[Medal of Honor: Allied Assault](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Allied_Assault), which hold a lot of time on my early computer usage count haha

[Redneck Rampage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Rampage), A completely ridiculous FPS

[Carmageddon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon), an even more ridiculous racing game inspired by *Death Race 2000*

[Lego Racers](https://archive.org/details/LegoRacersDemo), &lt;-- Link is to a downloadable demo. Great fun, and I'm sure that everyone else agrees.

I remember some more but not their names. They were certainly DOS games. I remember a 2D side=scrolling Motocross game where the speed was given by the height of the mouse on the screen. I remember a Babe (the little pig) game, some sort of early Final Fantasy game(?), Doom, and some others.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/crafted/caster.shtml

You should be at least level 90 before you start crafting so that you're drawing from the highest iLvl affix pools.

First off, you should add countess to your run. Crafting can net you some BiS items. +2\20FCR\2soc circlets (these are rare, but you can craft something close), +2 all skills ammy with at least 7FCR, FCR ring with at least +30 stats. Should you venture outside of meph runs you can consider a crafted belt. That way you can run Spirit/Spirit and then swap to your MF loadout for the boss kill (like an Occy_Baba // Mosers)

If your other gear allows it, you can craft some amazing boots and a belt. [For Example (crafted in orange)](http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff32/ben41591/tinkT1_zpsf46fffd1.jpg)

Yes, donate blood, or plasm if you can. Not just for Monty, just because it helps those that need it.  Sure, throw a few bucks towards the fund, if you can spare it, because it helps someone you want to support.  Send your well wishes, good thoughts, and prayers, if you pray that way, because his family and loved ones could use the support.

Just.. do be respectful.  It is a private matter, which fans and the general public will be updated on as the family, and only the family or a recovered Monty, decide it is time to let us know.  The RT staff is expressing their concern in a very reserved manner, as while a lot can be read into those statements, do appear to be positive and just trying to show their friend in a positive light, to show us how worried they are, and how much they love and appreciate him.

Maybe we all just chill on the asking what happened, send them all the well wishes we can, and just put up a general show of positive support?  A man is very ill, for whatever reason, and a lot of people are already probably feeling very worried without reading a million questions or people making demands on them.

I wish you so much luck in your recovery Monty Oum, for your fan, but more importantly your wife, family, and friends.

Skins have brought way more good into the game than bad. They have brought in A LOT of viewers. It has brought in a lot of sponsors and the prizes have been getting bigger which in turn has at least somewhat made the competition more fierce. Sure it hasnt been all good but betting on games would happen regardless, same goes for DDOSing, which could be somewhat solved by players sorting their shit out.","1422749407"

1. To answer your questions, most e-juice does contain Nicotine, but you can buy 0 Nicotine juice.

2. As for what is in them, every manufacturer is different as far as what they put in their juice, but the vast majority use a  Propylene Glycol or Vegetable Glycerine mixed base. There are no real studies that have been done to show the long term affects of vaping as of yet. Though it does seem to be healthier than smoking ""analogs.""

3. They can contain Nicotine, you can chose the level of the nicotine anywhere from 0-32mg. Nicotine is a very addictive substance and there are plenty of studies that show nicotine itself is poisonous if inhaled, absorbed, or ingested in large quantities.

4. Vape Pens are typically small batteries with a tank that is filled with a flavored liquid. ","1422749407"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I sort of follow what Carl Jung said in *Answer to Job* .  God is basically the ultimate masculine ideal of perfection, while his people, Israel, represents the feminine ideal of completeness.  YHWH is ""married"" to his people in a manner practically unheard of in other religions; and when two parties come together in a marriage, both of their personalities are transformed as their comparative strengths and weaknesses play off of one another. 

 So what you've got throughout the Bible is a long dialogue between a transcendent God and an Earthly people, who are viewing each other through a glass darkly, but are transforming one another as their consciousness develops.  As God is transforming his people, *they* are transforming *him* as well.  God's omniscience is paradoxically a blind spot for him, as a limitless God doesn't have the sort of feminine, compassionate moral insights that can only be understood by weak and finite human beings.  

So that's why you get the incredibly harsh God of the Old Testament, who incinerates Aaron's sons merely for bringing the wrong kind of oil to the altar, demands that rival cities be placed ""under the ban"" (I.e. Wiped out), and so on.  God is completely otherworldly, transcendent, and is thus incapable of the human standard of compassion, *until* he is tempered and brought from the beyond towards the world through his interactions with his compassionate wife, humanity.  

God and his people are moving toward one another, Israel seeking godliness and God seeking a wholistic understanding of his creation, in a process that culminates in God finally ""breaking through"" into the temporal world with his incarnation as Christ.  The ideal and the real thus meet with Christ inaugurating the Kingdom of God on Earth, and suffering in a manner in which God finally experiences suffering as human beings do.  The Kingdom of God is now the regime where God and humanity meet in the middle, as it were, and so serving the Kingdom is the Christian task.","1422749410"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have PTSD.  Real, well documented PTSD.

A side effect is insomnia for me, because beds are... unpleasant.

I survived a few years of rape and torture when I was a kid.  As of late I found the words to talk about it, which means it's all I talk about.  It's letting it all out.  I feel like I'm deflating in the best way possible.  It's a new development in life that unfortunately is a bit disturbing to hear, but I'm actually letting it all out.  I'm working really hard to reprogram myself to deal with these feelings.

Sometimes there will be something that triggers a memory and I don't even realize it until it's too late and I'm just shaking, trying to act normal.

Sometimes if I catch it I can take some meds and it'll help, but often there's no warning.

On occasion I'll get this one weird warning.  I'll hear like a radio channel being played at really low volume.  I don't remember anything about a radio, but it's my warning.  Sometimes I'll hear it when we're nowhere near a radio, and I'll know, but like at a restaurant I'm screwed, but it's usually a low grade reaction that I can keep quiet about.

When I'm in a bed when it happens, it's *really* bad.  Suddenly I'm not where I was.  Suddenly I'm in the house.  Suddenly I'm in the room, and there's someone in there with me.  I scream and thrash, but I can't stop it.

It's not like in the movies.  In the very worst ones I'm actually 100% there, but most of the time I come in and out.  I see from my eyes, when I touch things I feel it.  It's cold even if my real body is in a sauna.  I smell everything.  I hear everything.  There's no dreamlike state I'm actually there.

When I come out of it I'm pretty bruised up from the thrashing, usually so is whoever was near me.  I'm horse from screaming,  I'm weak, on occasion I've vomited, and usually the police have been called by someone.

I haven't had a full on flashback episode in about two years, and it's really rare that it's that bad.  The worst episodes I'm always in bed, which sucks.  My wife has been a tether to reality more than once.

There are things I avoid.  No blue blankets or sheets.  I don't go near construction zones.  I don't go to certain neighborhoods.  I have to tape my windows over so there's absolutely no light coming through.  I can't eat macaroni and cheese.  I recently got over my fear of diced tomatoes (gross story).  All to avoid memory triggers of certain events.  I used to avoid much more.  One by one I'm desensitizing myself.

Sex was very non traditional in my marriage for a long long time.  After our first time I couldn't actually let anyone see me undressed when there was sexual stimulus.  I couldn't get hard, so we used marital aides (dildo, vibrator, etc...).  Sex is for the most part typical these days, but on occasion I have to start fully clothed, I need to use an aide, or I have to stop and have her remind me that she isn't going to hurt me.  BDSM has been a godsend.  I can be 100% in control, and that has helped *so much*.

If I smell meth there's nothing I can do.  I'm gone.  I got close to going into a flashback when a neighbors house burned down late one night.  I'm pretty sure it would have ended horribly, because suddenly I was in the neighborhood again (in reality I was standing out front of my house), and my wife had to cling to my arm to keep me from fleeing. So the neighborhood got to watch me scream, awesome.  That's embarrassing.  Fortunately she was able to talk me back home and hang on to me.  I would have probably made my way into traffic.

I've never hit my wife, but I'll kick and bite if a male friend tries to help me.  

Most days I appear and feel 100% normal and happy.  I *am* normal and happy.  I can even talk about what happened with an emotional disconnection, but therapy is a fucking bitch, I'm not gonna lie.

I'm so much better every day.  I live a functional life.  When it gets to me I'm usually in my house, so no one sees it but my wife.  She knew me when it was happening, went to talk to therapists with me,  and studied my issue, so she understands.

Really, I'm lucky in a lot of ways.  I'm totally aware.","1422749411"

There's also an article about girls who had experiences with men who had micropenises, and none of them hated the guy and certainly did not want him dead. Many commented on how they had good sexual experiences with them and that the rest of the guy mattered far more than the size of his penis.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Part of the process of a typical male orgasm is build up and urge to release pressure as seminal fluid collects in/near the prostate. Foreplay and teasing triggers release of extra fluid inside the prostate and while it may increase pleasure overall, it makes it more difficult to purposefully delay orgasm and calm normal muscle contractions which cause release.

Having a release hours before sex can help aid in delaying orgasm during sex by having less prior built up fluid. Results may vary, as some males generate more fluid than others, and some males can delay orgasm through different techniques. The relaxing technique being more effective in lower fluid scenarios.","1422749413"

He said, but these arent ones that the whole world celebrates, like Valentine's day.

Because even way before GamerGate, I haven't seen that many instances where the gaming press actually had gaming's back when it came to controversial issues. Even those sellout schmucks at Extra Credits had an episode talking about the lack of balls gaming had when it came to handling controversy.

You're right, the gaming press are usually the FIRST ones to throw gamers under the bus once some bad incident happens or once the mainstream media sinks its teeth into gaming; these folks never come out and say ""Hey hey hey, you got it all wrong, I've been a part of this community for a long time, and that's not how it is so I'm here to defend our honor"", it's usually more ""D'ooooh, you're right, we are terribad, aren't we?""

They so easily bend to the whims of any negative press gaming receives, and instead of ever standing up for themselves, they feel ashamed of themselves and go into this self-flogging/self-loathing headspace and try to convince everyone else that ""No STFU, you ARE the stereotype they say we all are, so we have to listen to THEM to change.""

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","Fair enough, but I'd still argue the Cubs get a lot more out of Wrigley as a tourist destination than the vast majority of other teams do with their ballparks.  ""Go spend an afternoon at Wrigley"" is on the list of almost anyone visiting Chicago, baseball fan or not.  Plus, having lived right next to Wrigleyville for a few years now, there's still a huge college-age/mid-20s contingent that just go to Cub games to party and don't care about baseball, my coworkers are a great example of that.

However, that's not to say the White Sox fanbase doesn't have its issues.  Yeah, we're constantly playing second fiddle to the Cubs even in the years when our team is way better, but that's just life as a Sox fan that many White Sox fans refuse to accept (and it also has its benefits, like cheaper tickets and the knowledge that I can go to a game whenever I want without having to plan ahead).  Sometimes the chip on the shoulder and extreme focus on the Cubs can be embarrassing, and I really wish we could focus that attention more on our ALC rivals than on our intercity brethren.  Though, I will admit that I can still get quite annoyed sometimes when the Tribune is putting up garbage headlines like [Somber Streak](http://www.chicagotribune.com/cs-050508soxgamer-story.html) after the Sox win eight in a row and matched their best start in team history.","1422749415"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Autism is a condition where your brain's wiring is unique from that of neurotypical (""average"") folk. This makes it difficult for autistic people to imagine/relate to the motivations and thought processes of those who are not so similarly circumstanced as they.

This creates a lot of stress for them when placed in situations that NTs don't normally have trouble with - job interviews, dates, casual friendships, etc. With autism the stress is essentially the exacerbating factor, not the unique pattern of thinking itself that the person has, although many out there in the general population still have as yet to learn that.

Have you a bird?

You have but not all cups in the cupboard!

Holla the wood fairy!

There goes the dog crazy in the pan

You have a jump in the bowl

I show you how the rabbit runs

I hold it at the head not out

Heaven, ass and thread!

You can me once crosswise

Scratch the curve!

Calves are among the hardest muscles to train because the lower you go in a mans body, the lower the density of androgen receptors. Even bodybuilders on roids occasionally struggle with calves. There are some exercises that target them (a quick google search will suffice) as the normal compound lifts don't really hit them hard. 1 month is not going to be nearly enough to give you size there - even on the upper body 1 month is not that long of a time.

My idea is that, if I setup a VPN at home, locally, then when I go for example to work, I could see my local plex library. I think plex pass removes the need for this, but then it also costs more than I can afford.

*mobile/tablet connections, outside home, would go through my home VPN, wich would not only give me access to my plex library, but also would give additional security/privacy (not just for plex)... and as I understand, I could freely connect using anywheres wifi, because VPN encrypts and I'd be connecting as from home, not the local free wifi coffeecup, for example.

But in the end if the government doesn't have the money its unsustainable.

It's different when your income margins are smaller, as is the case of many people who live here in Kansas. Sure, your money goes farther here, but incomes are lower, so while alcohol may be cheaper, it still adds up for poor people.

Alcohol and tobacco taxes disproportionately affect poor people - this is an uncontroversial statement.

As for what the Bible says, sure I don't follow the Jewish laws, I'm not a Jew. But whatever Jesus said I try to follow. And he says the most important thing is to love God with everything you've got and love others as I love myself. That basically covers all the moral quandaries I come up with.

I guess you could call that Divine Command Theory. Sure, but if God knows best, than wouldn't it be smart to listen?

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Reiterating what a lot of others have said, it's the inconsistency in his play and TOs. Some people also think since he's relatively old for a second year player he has less 'potential' than other players the Sixers could draft (Mudiay etc.), though I'm not completely sold on that.

One game he'll decide he has to be the primary scorer (and yes, sometimes he does have to be given the roster) and will start chucking up ill-advised long twos or threes, or slashing and trying to force a shot, or force passes that aren't there. Other times he'll play within himself and make the right passes and score opportunistically. 

The turnovers are definitely a problem but some of that can be attributed to the team (e.g. Noel's stone hands), though it seems to be slowly improving. Again, the lack of shooters other than Covington leads to a lot of inside pressure on drives where MCW gets stripped as well.

One thing that should probably be noted by everybody complaining on his shot not improving is that he had shoulder surgery last offseason and couldn't work on his shot so in some ways he's practicing through higher volume shooting in game.

I think all this means is that maybe you still have some things to get over woth your ed. And that's okay. I get triggered by people a lot too, I don't know that it's worth ending a relationship (either a relationship relationship or a friend relationship) over. However if you need to take some time away from her while you're recovering that seems reasonable. Really it's your own choice and no one else can have a say in this beside you (and your relationship buddy). Remember that recovery can take a while and can be bumpy so just be gentle on yourself. Also remember that we're all built differently, your friend's healthy (not sure that she is healthy, it was not specified) may not be your healthy.

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","I'm not 100% sure exactly what you two are arguing about, but I'll chime in with this:

Engines like Unity 3D and Game Maker have lowered the barrier of entry, more and more people have access to computers and the internet, crowdfunding methods like kickstarter and patreon allow people to get funding, and markets like Steam and all the little indie communities help people get their games out there.

Two decades ago you'd be very hard pressed to make money as a lone developer because of a high barrier of entry and all kinds of obstacles. Today, all you need is a laptop with a free GameMaker lisence, paint.net, and a few contacts. Other resources, like presskit(), might even get rid of the contacts issue if you're lucky. Risk of Rain, Vlambeer's games, and Hotline Miami come to mind as great games made with GameMaker.

That's just in theory, of course, because the game scene is still ruthless. Still, things have changed a lot in the last years.","1422749439"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Must Have:
1 - Overdrive/Distortion -  So many to list but I have a Boss BD-2 that I like and a EHX Soul Food which is a Klon clone.  I also have the Xotic SL Drive which is more of a Marshall Super Lead in a box.  Put this in front of your Fender and it'll transform it into a Marshall Stack.

2 - Delay - Analogue vs Digital.  You'll need to do research on the differences and I can only really speak towards digital.  That said it really is a personal thing as to which you like so you'll have to try them both out.  I have the Boss -DD-5 and TC Electronic Flashback.  I prefer the Flashaback due to more functionality.  A commonly liked analogue delay would be the MXR Carbon Copy.

3 - Tuner - I have the Boss TU but the Polytune is pretty cool because you can tune the whole guitar in one strum.

Might Want:
1 - Xotic SP Compressor.  Squashes highs, brings up lows and adds sustain.  Can help in giving you a very clipped sound.
2 - Wah - Not a punk/indie guy myself so not sure if you'd want this.  Something to keep in mind - some wah's will oscillate when put in front of a Fuzz Pedal so be sure to try both out in a chain before purchasing
3 - Fuzz - That whole Hendrix, Rolling Stones Satisfaction sound.  I have the Red Fuzz Face Mini and it suits me well.  It has germanium resistors which tend to give a more warm sound.  The other option would be the Blue Face Face which has Silicon transistors.  Another very popular fuzz is the EHX Big Muff.
4 - Chorus - I can't really speak to specifics because I hardly use mine.
5 - EQ - This is great when switching to a lead sound.  You can boost our signal, scoop mids, boost mids, etc.
6 - Wah - I have a Bonamassa Wah and a run of the mill CryBaby.  Personally they sound the same to me but hey maybe my ear sucks.

Now onto an odd pedal:
POG 2 - this thing is weird and very specific.  It'll give you 2 octaves above and 2 octaves below on top of your direct dry input.  There are many more features in this pedal that can make your guitar sound like an organ.  I tend to use it as a way to turn my guitar into a bass so I can lay a bass line down.  Looking back on this purchase, its a fun pedal but it just doesn't suit me.

Another bit of advice is you've played a pedal and are dead set on getting it, look on ebay.  These things are almost always selling below their new cost and most of the time are in great condition.  The only exception is the Klon which sells for an obscene amount.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","The dilators as placed in areas where he does not have hair. He had pretty hi level hair loss almost a frair tuck distribution. We purposely spare the vertex (the bald center of the scalp where more men bald first) because this is the natural progression of things. This is where most men would bald first and it would look funny and artificial if this area was thicker than other areas of his head. We would typically fill in the ""widows peaks"" and the vertex last. This is often a staged procedure - you can only transplant so many hairs at a time. Also more of your friends would be on to you if you were initially almost bald and then showed up with a full head of hair, right? ","1422749443"

"gamegrumps","t5_2ulfu","I don't have much of an opinion of Suzy, have actually seen very little she's been in (because I'm selective about games the Grumps play and gravitate towards Dan's interests a lot of times as I'm of similar age, which statistically avoided Suzy.) 

But speaking totally in general, I don't think everyone can be good at anything. Some things are natural talent, or personality based. Like I would love to be a performer like one of the Grumps. But I'm a lackadaisical personality. My best ""art"" comes from my head, generally in the form of computer programming. I'm definitely not eloquent, and if I'm speaking ""live"" I'm going to frequently stumble on my words before I get out something I'm trying to describe. The point is, I can't possibly imagine anyone ever enjoying me in a live performance as such. I don't delude myself into thinking I could be a Grump, it's just not going to happen, ever.

Most people show a sign of their general ability somewhere during their childhood. You think how Egorapter has been doing Newgrounds videos before Game Grumps. You have Danny who was in NSP before Game Grumps. Jon had his own stuff too before Game Grumps. They've all been some kind of performer either online or out in the world, and it was proven before Game Grumps even existed.

The point I'm trying to get at I guess is not that Suzy can't eventually be good, and certainly not fighting that there might be some unfair book-cover judging going on, and all that stuff. But just because she wants to be a Grump in the comedic way doesn't mean she can be. I'm a firm believer I can be a great computer programmer and a generally undesirable live performer, and that's just the way it will be. And I say that because I was about 10-12 years old when I started showing interest in computer programming, it just naturally stuck, and I've been doing it pretty much nonstop for the next 20 years or so. That was just the sort of thing that made sense to me.

So, yes, Suzy's inexperienced. Can she hit a comedic stride? Maybe, I don't know well enough. But can she do it only because she WANTS to, without having previously demonstrated some ability to a general audience that is in fact has good comedic delivery in the style of Grumps? I can't say that either, but I can say, just wanting is not enough. In entertainment, especially live performances, you have to let it develop organically based on your strong points. Maybe I could deliver a programming language seminar. I will never be an energetic, story-telling Grump, no matter how much I might want that to be true.","1422749443"

I chose illusion because I have a few useful illusions, and the +2 from the Wise Warrior as well as a rating 3 focus to boost my combat spells up to 17d6, which I assumed would be sufficient.

I'm hoping to develop him into someone more befitting of the ""Wise Warrior"" mantle, as he currently has some of the warrior down but none of the wise - the idea being that the spirit would be a ""mentor"" for him along that journey. (Sorry if I'm misunderstanding part of the lore here)

I wasn't planning to wear both the jacket and the suit at the same time, but now that you point it out I could probably spring for some extra armor tweaks.

"Suomi","t5_2qlq3","Yksikään valtio ei tule ""teknologian suurvallaksi"" sillä että jokaiseen kotiin tulee valtion maksama tietokone.


Yleinen käsitys ""teknonologia yhteiskunnasta"" lienee se että suurinosa palveluista on saatavilla sähköisesti. Sen lisäksi voidaan puhua yleisestä teknologisesta koulutuksen tasosta ja erilaisten teknologia yrityksen olemassaolosta.


Sähköinen asiointi on parantunut huomattavasti, en ole käynyt kelassa kuin ehkä kerran tai kaksi eläessäni. Parannettavaa on kuitenkin. Suurin este tälle kehitykselle lienee kuitenkin näiden palveluiden hankinta. Projektit venyy ja rahaa palaa. Missä vika?


Yleinen teknologia koulutuksen taso ja erilaisten teknologia yritysten kasvu ja synty ovat yhteydessä toisiinsa. Matematiikkaa ja englannin koulutusta pitäisi kasvattaa. Lisäksi ohjelmointia pitäisi alkaa opettaa jo alakouluissa. Näin saadaan ihmisiä jotka voivat käyttää ohjelmoinnin perustaitotoja ihan missä tahansa työssä. Ohjelmointi on ongelmien ratkaisua tietokoneella ei pelkkään ohjelmistokehitystä. Tämä antaisi myös hyvät mahdollisuudet teknologia teollisuudelle menestyä suomessa.


Lisäksi se että erilaiset valtiolliset ja kunnalliset tahot jakavat avointadataa on hyvä asia. Avoindata mahdollistaa sen että kuka tahansa voi tehdä yhteiskuntaa hyödyntävän sovelluksen ja mahdollisesti joka työllistää itsensä.","1422749447"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","If the overdrive channel isn't quite enough for the style of music you're playing, an overdrive or distortion pedal will get you there. I don't have personal experience with any of these, but people really seem to love the ibanez tube screamer, fulltone OCD, and proco rat. So that's a good place to start. 

Some kind of modulation pedal is probably a good idea too, when I got my phaser it inspired me to play a lot more and opened me up to new styles of playing. You'll want to get something that fits the kind of music you play. Find out what kind of effects your favorite bands are using and start there. 

Electro harmonix, mxr, boss, and tc electronic all make good quality, reasonably priced pedals. There are of course many, many other manufactures that make good pedals. I recommend watching videos of different pedals and trying them yourself before you buy so you know if you're going to get the sound you're looking for. 

There are tons of different pedals out there, but I recommend starting with one or two versatile, high quality pedals. I buy most of my stuff used because its a lot cheaper, but that's a personal preference kind of thing. ","1422749449"

This is the effect of reorganizing production more efficiently, the effect of capitalization.  This is what generates profit in the sense of *aggregate* value-added production.

Marx treats value-added production as if it's borrowing that added value from somewhere else.  This is wrong because you can create value out of thin air just by using base inputs more productively (via technology/capitalization).","1422749449"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ISylK4g6UM

If you can truly think this is a Christian nation you have your head in the sand.

""Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man""- Thomas Jefferson

""Lighthouses are more useful than churches.""- Ben Franklin

 ""The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason.""- Ben Franklin

""There is not one redeeming feature in our superstition of Christianity. It has made one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites.""- Thomas Jefferson

""This would be the best of all possible worlds if there were no religion in it""- John Adams

""Of all the tyrannies that affect mankind, tyranny in religion is the worst.""- Thomas Paine

""Take away from Genesis the belief that Moses was the author, on which only the strange belief that it is the word of God has stood, and there remains nothing of Genesis but an anonymous book of stories, fables, and traditionary or invented absurdities, or of downright lies.""- Thomas Paine

""I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any Church that I know of. My own mind is my own Church. Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all.""- Thomas Paine

""The Bible is not my book, nor Christianity my profession.""- Abraham Lincoln

""Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise.""- James Madison﻿","1422749449"

I think tenure needs to be conditional on passing some kind of regular job evaluation - not that you have to get flying colors but passing ones. Only then does it serve students instead of incompetent teachers. I doubt good teachers would worry as they would know they'd blow the review out of the water.

I thought the real A was harassing Alison long before she disappeared and that Mona didn't get the idea to become A until she came across Alison that night and she told her everything about A and the death threats and whatnot? Then the real A took the game back from Mona, or was Mona A back then too? 

I kind of got the impression the real A was at work while Mona was too, like even after the reveal I don't think it was Mona who met Emily in the green house and dropped the phone. It wasn't Ezra in the creepy house in Ravenswood either because Spencer cut the attackers hand with the sheers before she got knocked out and Ezra never had a wound on his hand after that to indicate that was him.

"Chromecast","t5_2xz02","There are no other options other than mirroring.  Amazing has very stubbornly refused to develop Chromecast support, instead opting to push their Amazon Fire TV and Fire Stick.

They only recently caved and released the Amazon Instant Video app for Android this past year, after refusing for a very long time.

To get the app, you have to download the Amazon App Store to your device first, and then use the App Store (Not the Play Store) to download the Amazon shopping app.  If you already have that app on your device from the play store, delete it first.  THEN you have to download the Instant Video App from the Amazon Play store, which really just activates an ability within the core Amazon Store App to access the Prime streaming instant video area.

Then you would have to stream the whole screen from your device to the Chromecast, which will be laggy and hard on your device's battery, since it is doing all the streaming and decoding.

Not worth it in my opinion.  I happen to have a Wii U and a chromecast.  I use chromecast for everthing else (Google Play, Netflix, local media with Avia, Disney Anywhere, Flixster, etc.), and my Wii U to stream Amazon Streaming the few times that I actually want to use Amazon's service.

Där satt jag med dubbla universitetsexamina i samma rum som folk som de behövde tala om när de skulle anteckna, var de skulle anteckna och att de inte skulle ha fötterna på borden.

Sen kan man prata om alla de där pengarna som går till tveksamma coacher som kostar multum men ger väldigt tveksamma resultat och alla löjliga regler om att man t.ex. ska söka jobb man är under/överkvalificerad för och som man inte har en chans i helvetet att få. Plus alla lagar och förordningar som bakbinder de handläggare som faktiskt vill göra ett bra jobb.

These people then take a cut of whatever profit you get on your portfolio + fees. So there's a cut for the manager, and then another cut for the brokers.

Don't trust investment managers, do your own research and manage your own stocks. I'd recommend looking into mutual funds/ treasury bonds/ precious metals if you're looking to invest.

There really isn't any ""unmanly"" emotions to feel or show. Everyone feels emotions and if your too scared to show them than people will probably try to open you up by asking or something. People around me feel comfort in knowing that someone feels the same about something.

Guys are expected to treat women as the same as friends, unless your trying to get with them. Then you just flirt with them or dm them on insta or twitter or something that your interested and try to ask them out irl or through text.

Becoming a man for me right now is getting a job, my license, and getting into college and following my dreams. As far as becoming a man with a girl or whatever: if your a virgin, no one cares. The only people who will actually bully you for being a virgin are douchebags and jerks who are probably also virgins because girls hate douchebags. Everyones pretty laid back about life because everyone matures at a different rate.

Issues young men face would be confidence issues. Usually people with lots of confidence are the ones who thrive in high school. If you don't care what people think, are friendly and fun to be around, and you can make everyone laugh and be social, you will have  lots of friends and girls will be on you like a tick on a hound. People without confidence are the ones who care too much what others think of them and become socially anxious and shy or have low self esteem. And there is way too many of these people. Most of the time people grow out of it because they realize life is way better if you don't give a fuck what others think and let it all out. That's what happened to me. Being happy and having a positive perspective on life is what people want, even if it does make you a little ignorant.

Also I would like to point out weed is a big thing. If you smoke it, your likely to have ""cooler"" or ""more popular"" friends. The problem is these people won't make it far in life. They're already dropping out hs in my class, and i'm a junior.","1422749458"

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","&gt; a religious cult that typically carries out the death penalty by stoning ...

Is there any evidence for this assertion in the context of the Baltimore Islamic Society? ? 

Religion might be raised where there is actual evidence tying the defendant to the views propounded.  


Thought experiment: 

Say you were accused for bombing an abortion clinic and you lived in a household that was known to be very conservatively Christian. You attend church regularly and while conservative, none of the religious leaders have expressed views encouraging violence, tough individual members of the congregation have a variety of views.  There is a fringe Christian group, the Eastboro Raiders, camped out in a forest compound who regularly parade through town encouraging violent action against abortion doctors, they were cast out from your church and their views are unacceptable to most of the congregation.

Would it be fair to allege your religious views were a motive in the following circumstances:  

1. You've stood outside the clinic holding placards with religious slogans prepared by others. You say you never really read the slogans, it's just something your church friends were doing.

2. You've previously protested against the clinic by signing a petition.

3. You've never protested against the abortion clinic, have never said that you oppose abortion though secretly you think it's wrong to aid in abortions. There's no evidence you supported violent action in the name of religion. You don't know any of the Eastboro Raiders except from gossip in the congregation.

4. No one has ever heard you say anything against the abortion clinic. You don't really live a strictly religious life, a fact your parents would not approve of if they knew. No one in your family has ever spoken in a way that suggests they approve of violent action. Your friends say you're actually not opposed to abortion and have supported friends who've gone through them  (unbeknownst to your conservative pastor). Your conservative pastor thinks it's wrong to kill anyone involved in abortion and was involved in counselling the members of his flock who ended up defecting to the ERs.

In which scenario would your conservative Christian upbringing, and their possible links to the Eastboro Raiders, be relevant evidence about your intentions to commit the crime?","1422749459"

You all obviously sound like very intelligent and tech savvy people, I want to propose some steps you might try to get the ball rolling.


First of all you are in possession of the greatest tool humans have ever created: the Internet.  You literally have the resources to learn everything there is to know about Social Anxiety Disorder.  Even if some of the information you need is behind paywalls chances are you can obtain a copy of the information from other sources online, digital copies of textbooks, lectures, and even the DSM can be found at no cost.


I say this especially to those of you that cannot afford or cannot push yourself to see a psychiatrist or psychologist.  Become an expert on your disorder, research what types of symptoms and types you personally exhibit, learn more about your particular flavor of SAD than even an accomplished psychologist does.  Learn which treatments there are both counseling and medications.  Make a game plan then find a way to get the specific help you need.  Generally a psychiatrist needs to see you only once to get a diagnosis and write a prescription and many will agree to refill so long as you see them a couple of times a year and explain the other less expensive forms of counseling you have found.

There's a wealth of avenues you can take for counseling and ways to utilize the techniques you have researched.  You could find a friend or family member that you are comfortable with and teach them what you need, you could find someone to help you via a support forum, somewhere you can communicate via text so you can  remain anonymous and avoid triggering your anxiety.  Please don't ever give up!","1422749459"

In the time scale of large governments, gay marriage and other issues are getting changed in the face of consolidated top down power.  You referenced the comments from Republicans earlier, but every time a comment like that is made there is a public outcry and the politician and party associated with it take a hit.

&gt;I mean what I just said about money changing laws.

Money changes laws, but so does political pressure.  The national women's organizations have been able to affect significantly several laws over the past two decades, while less direct methods have resulted in changes to laws in line with Feminist goals over the past half decade.  Around the world, women in elected and lobbying positions are actively controlling the dialogue when it comes to gender issues.  India won't acknowledge female on male rape because women lobby against it.  A discussion of women using false accusations of DV in divorce hearings in Australia is impossible due to women elected to their legislature.  Things may be different now than 100 years ago in terms of who is in the positions of top down power, but the way that men are treated hasn't radically changed.

&gt;What I'm actually saying is that if women cause 35% problems while men cause 65% problems for other men.

Why didn't the author talk or mention the role women play since 35% is a pretty big percentage?  That number is a guess (I assume), so how high does it have to be before it is unreasonable to only talk about men negatively affecting others and start talking about how people negatively affect others?","1422749463"

Counter-Terrorists can win by defusing a planted bomb, running down the time or eliminating all Terrorists.

It is first to 16, out of a total 30 rounds. If a tie is reached, overtime is played. Counter-Terrorists will set up basic positions to ward off Terrorists and Terrorists will execute pre-planned strategies to enable them to enter a bomb site and plant.

I haven't let this stop me and I continue to work hard on coding, adding new items to the game and more styles of ZOMBIES! We are aiming for a new texture overhaul adding in Cel-shaded graphics and better animations!

I have decided to open the project up so people can see whats going on and aid in the development of the game, My team and I will be posting regularly on facebook and on reddit, (once I become more familiar with it) Keeping everyone updated on its progress. 

Currently we have nearly 25 guns from Pistols to Berret 50.cals and An extensive Crafting library! We aim to add new gear and guns weekly!

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You're in a tight spot.

1)  Clear your head.  Try to only do the things right now that will matter in 10 years.  In ten years, you will probably wish you hadn't pushed for an abortion, so back away from that decision.  You will wish you had spoken clearly and calmly with your father, accepted responsibility for your actions, and let the chips fall as they may.  If he chooses to deal with you in a sinful way, that's for him to regret, not you.  You will wish you had supported your girlfriend through this pregnancy, emotionally and financially, so find ways to do that.

2)  You have plenty of time to deal with the people who want to straighten you out and lecture you.  They're probably right in their Christian conclusions, but you know that already.  So let most of those conversations bounce off you and start mentally separating the people who want to help you from the people who just want you to wallow in your guilt.

3)  There is mercy and forgiveness for your sin, friend.  Remember that and also remember that babies are still gifts, even if they come in circumstances you wouldn't choose.  Your upcoming child is not a punishment.

Basically, you need to adopt a LONG-term perspective and provide for your early family.  Your father may (sinfully or not) react poorly to the news, but something tells me he will happily play with your 9-year-old in 10 years...","1422749467"

I see her as sort of the start of this trend. Games are an art &amp; people are already beginning to see them as an art form. Literary &amp; cultural criticism follows pretty much any art form &amp; part of that is looking at the art form through a feminist lens (I'm sure critics looking from a queer theory/marxist/postcolonial lens will follow (maybe they're already there &amp; I don't know about them)).

So, yeah, I agree with you but I think that Sarkeesian is good because, despite her work not being particularly incisive (though one could argue that that's because it's geared at a general audience), she's opening up one of these discussions. I find it bizarre that so many people are up in arms about her criticisms too, since she's one of a wave of people who is starting to treat video games *as* art &amp; as culturally important which is exactly what gamers should want.","1422749475"

Referring specifically to the ""probability"" example, I gave an example of the entire subreddit and the large majority of the people who WOULD throw a MM match just for skins, because hey, phr33 virtual skins that also have real $$$ value, so why not.


The example was supposed to help you understand the *honor* that many people here would toss aside to do the exact same thing as in swag's situation, if not go even further ahead with bigger bets and frequent throws.


The paragraph you quoted, refers specifically to people like you within this subreddit *who behind their monitors, are passing judgement and are unwilling to truly place themselves in swags shoes to try and understand the influences that led to that most probable decision*. (Again to reiterate, not saying his ban should be lifted). 


Now I didn't say I'm a prophet and that I know 100% that all those people including you would throw the game. If you read the paragraph again, it clearly implies that people who are talking shit about him would most *probably* throw the game as well, so those people specifically (including you) need to stop acting all honorable and innocent because YOU can't say that you would never do that since you were not in his position. Which again is why I said, I probably would have as well.


PS. Answer this, would you throw a solo MM game (with 4 random teammates that you do not know) for a Karambit Fade?

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","“Happy birthday Mel!” My sister/clone excitedly yells shoving a cupcake in my face, not even letting me sit up in bed before making me blow it out. 
“Happy birthday Sal” I smile at my younger sister. Even though we are identical, people can always tell the difference between my sister and me, and after today, no-one will have to. 
It’s our 21st birthday, something people in the old days used to celebrate by getting drunk and having sex, and doing drugs.  But now, it was the day society chose which version of ourselves was better. Honestly, looking at my little sister, I had no idea who would be chosen. 
“Come on girls, we’ve got to go.” My mother yelled from down stairs and Sally and I shared a look. 
Even though we weren’t technically twins, we still had the ability to know exactly what one another where thinking.  It was kind of weird for other people, since they usually didn’t get along with their clones, but my sister and I have always been different. 
See, after a few years, parents decided that they would give their natural born child the best hope of being chosen. So some parents would beat, torture, maim, and starve their children’s clone so that they would never be chosen to join our oh-so-perfect society.  
Sally left the cupcake on my bedside table and practically bounded over to her side of the room – we had shared the same room (thankfully not the same bed) since we were brought home from the hospital. And even though when I was growing up I had wished I had my own room, now that I was older, I wouldn’t change a thing. 
My sister was one of the few clones that went wrong.  She was born with Down syndrome. Maybe that was why my parents didn’t feel the need to do anything to her, they were confident that I would be the one.  
I pulled on some black dress pants and a nice white button down shirt. Not only was the day we got separated for the first time, but it was the day I was given my place in society. They would test our capabilities, mentally, physically, but also test our personalities; kindness, generosity. When they said they wanted a perfect society, they weren’t kidding.
Sal came and locked her arm around mine, like we did when we were playing bride and groom when we were younger, giving me a kiss on the cheek in one of her rare emotional moments. 
The car ride was quiet. I had the feeling neither of my parents quite knew what to say to the two of us. I mean, how could you say ‘happy birthday, now one of you will die’ without sounding creepy? And they couldn’t exactly tell us everything was going to be ok – because it wasn’t, one of us would die today, and for our sakes they were going to pretend it wasn’t happening. 
“Melanie Anne Parton?” The nurse at the desk asked when we walked in, and I raised my hand, indicating that I was the natural born, and the first to go through testing. 
I wrapped Sally in my embrace, holding her close and trying hard not to break down in tears – would they even let us say goodbye? Neither of my parents would tell us what happened on this day, only that they would take the two of us, and bring one of us home. 
The beep test was the worst thing invented in human history. It has been around longer than I have, and they still haven’t thought of a better way to test endurance in young people. By the sixth level, I was sweating and had to bow out. The people taking notes looked slightly impressed, before motioning me onto the rope, which I looked at, before deciding quickly I wasn’t going to even try. 
The mental tests were weird. A psychologist came in, sat down and started showing me ink spots – asking me to describe what I saw. Then the woman, who must have been at least fifty, asked me about what I thought I wanted to be when this was all over. I knew the practised answer I was meant to give, something along the lines of ‘I’ll do whatever the government wants me to do.’ But looking into her sincere grey eyes, I had to tell her the truth.  
“I want to do something with history, I love learning things about the past, like how there were countries other than this one, and their names and cultures. It’s really fascinating to me.” 
The womans eyes were guarded and I had no idea if I had done the right thing. The government hated being reminded about once was – they only wanted us to know about the present, how this government was our past, future and present. 

They blindfolded me. I didn’t understand why. Leading me away from the building I was pretty sure – where they taking me out the back to shoot me? Or to the room where they would tell me what career I would have for the rest of my life? I didn’t know whether to beg for my life or stay silent – would either really help anyway? 
After what I assumed to be another few metres I hit a brick wall, and the person behind me slowly turned me around, not removing the blindfold. 
“Please” I whimpered, unable to stop myself. 
“Shh” A womans voice answered, smoothing my hair.  Before stepping away. 
I think the blindfold was to help, so that I wouldn’t see it coming. So that I didn’t have to stare death in the face. I straightened my shoulders standing to my full height – if I was going to die, then I would die proud, knowing that my sister, my sweet, loving sister would live on in my stead. 
Breath in, breath out, breath in, breath out. 
I feel like I’ve been waiting forever, but just when I think they’ve forgotten me, I hear a noise to my left. My heart starts hammering in my chest with the possibility that it was a gun cocking, taking aim at my heart. I force myself to breath, and then my blindfold is removed, revealing a room filled with books – the library. 
“Congratulations, you have been chosen to be a librarian.” A woman speaks but I don’t really comprehend the words. 
For some reason, I’m not really happy.

"civ","t5_2rk3b","* Inca.

I absolutely love the Inca. Sadly, Inca + very mountainy/hilly map is OP as hell while Inca + regular map is a bit boring, but even so, I really enjoy playing them.

Their UI isn't just overpowered, it's also game-changing in that it completely redefines what a ""good"" city spot is. The maintenance free roads on hills also let you do some interesting things there, like Civ IV style roadspam as long as you're in a sufficiently hilly area.

Plus, if you take commerce (yuck) you get free roads/railroads everywhere. That also can be kinda neat. Assuming you're a big fan of spaghetti, anyway...

* Austria (and Venice).

When you acquire a city-state, it doesn't take any damage. It keeps its current population and all(?) its buildings. If you're playing on a difficulty where the AI gets crazy advantages, this can almost be like getting a second capital.

Venice is also pretty fun due to their unique UA, but I don't want to list them twice.

* Arabia, Mongolia, the Huns.

Mounted archery is fun. Broken, but fun. For extra cheese you can play it on a slow game speed and, happiness willing, win a domination victory before your UU ever goes obsolete.

* The Shoshone.

Every city you found is like a visit to r/popping but except without the nauseous imagery or throwing up or... you know what? Just don't go to that sub. There's a reason I didn't make it a working link.

Uh, right, anyway, it's very satisfying to found a city as them. I guess that's not super special, but it's fun.

* Ethiopia

At least until you start spending more time managing your damned (heh) missionaries than you do managing your actual empire. So a bit soso, but still!

* Byzantium.

Sadly not fun at all on higher difficulties. Still, on lower ones where religion is actually a solid option for them to pursue, they're a lot of fun. One of my all-time favorite games in V was me playing as Byzantium on Y(n)AEMP back in G&amp;K.

Dromons let me conquer the entire Mediterranean early game. Later, Ceremonial Burial + Printing Press + Itinerant Preachers allowed me to puppet over half Eurasia and still have lots of spare happiness.

* Carthage.

Not that powerful, but ICS with them and their free harbors is kinda fun. Maybe(?) more fun in G&amp;K than BNW, but still pretty fun in BNW.

Also, honorable mention goes to Polynesia on Y(n)AEMP and a slow game speed. Being able to rush-colonize Oceania as well as the Americas is neat. Not really one of my favorite things, but it's neat.","1422749483"

The cross sections aren't high enough for such a reaction to occur in a considerable number. You can't pop nuclei together and make a new one. To let a fusion happen you need the right conditions, which are generally temperature, density and time. A young star in the hydrogen burning phase is simply not hot and dense enough in the core to let this kind of fusion be the predominant one. That doesn't make it impossible to happen, but so unlikely that you can say the chance for it is practically zero. You would find the right conditions only in the cores of  big and old (relatively spoken, as such stars don't really become old). 

In the same way you wouldn't find the CNO-cycle in any star that is fusing hydrogen in its core. There are several kinds of hydrogen fusion, again mostly depending in temperature and density. You won't find CNO fusion inside of red dwarfs because of the low temperatures and densities there. In the same way, CNO and pp III fusion are predominant in young hot blue stars, because they are more effective under those conditions there. ","1422749484"

I just want to reiterate that this argument is nonsensical.  You're claiming the federal government tried to ""bypass"" the constitution by using powers *specifically granted them by the constitution*.  It's entirely within the rights of the government to regulate international trade, and only NAFTA prevented them from doing so in this case.","1422749484"

LOL. Since you refused to address the actual points I've raised I'll take that as an admission on your part that you admit I and others are correct.  

You are fresh off the boat and yet think you are an expert. Actually that indicates you suffer from [Anchoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) Having ready your thesis which shows a lack of actual hard science skills and essentially just plugging in numbers into a program you didn't write and barely understand, I can see why you react with anger and attacks instead of actually looking at the evidence and replying to the points that I and others raised. 

And by the way - saying ""I have 4 degrees from MIT"" - doesn't impress anyone who looks at the fact that 2 of your degrees are all at the BS level with your highest one having a thesis that says nothing other than ""I can enter numbers and use other people's software.""  When people brag about having degrees it usually means PhD or MD or JD, not a BS or ""Technology Policy MS"".

No need to worry though, for example just check the menu before entering or see the general atmosphere (if the place is central and full of tourists eating there, er...). Also if you plan to visit Uffizi go 30 minutes before it is closed. That saved our day.

Even doing your class presentations in English is accepted. Also, most of the professors attended tertiary institutions in America/Canada/the UK, etc, and generally have a 'decent' grasp of English.

I just likened my situation to that of many undergraduate and graduate students in America from China who can only speak English very poorly but yet seem to get by.  


Against my defense:
No I have not read any texts in Chinese about my field of study. Nor have I worked with any native Chinese speakers from my field and been forced to use Chinese. Without subtitles, I probably would only be able to comprehend 5-10% of a lecture given in my field of study, given the specific vocabulary.



I have of course thought about this issue. My initial idea was record every lecture and then find a native speaker(s) and in exchange for English help/lessons/money, have them transcribe every lecture for me (day by day, not all at once）. I would then be able to study the material from that point.

"ABDL","t5_2r8xk","From Merriam-Webster:

&gt; com·mu·ni·ty
&gt; 
&gt; noun, often attributive \kə-ˈmyü-nə-tē\
&gt; 
&gt; 1: a group of people who live in the same area (such as a city, town, or neighborhood)
&gt; 
&gt; 2: a group of people who have the same interests, religion, race, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 3: a group of nations

Not really up for much discussion. By definition 2, having a shared interest is all it takes for a community. So yes, there is an AB/DL community simply because there is a group of people that all ascribe to the label of AB/DL. Whether each individual feel they are a part of the community can vary, but there's no question, a community *does* exist.

Do we have sub-communities? Well... that's just as obvious. It's right in the name. AB/DL. Two groups, and frequently those from one group express that they are *not* part of the other group. And that's not even getting into stuff like babyfurs, and the individual cliques.

&gt; As AB/DL grows online, does the communities, if they exist, grow or shrink? 

According to the definition used above, yes.

No offense, but this question is kind of bland and I was expecting better. There isn't really much to discuss. It took two seconds to Google an actual answer.","1422749490"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","So, a couple of things about what you've said here strike me.

First, you say you usually end up doing things on the first date that some girls never do.  Have you thought about maybe not having sex on the first date?  There are a couple of benefits to this - you're spending time together doing things besides sex, and getting to know each other outside of the bedroom.  Also, if there's real sexual chemistry, it's pretty hot to let it build up for a while!  Save your sexy tricks for a few weeks and blow your mind AFTER they get to know you as someone other than a fantastic lay.

Second, and I could be reading into this incorrectly, but are you having sex with every guy you date?  And if so, do you actually WANT to have sex with them?  I find this surprising because back when I was dating, I didn't want to have sex with the majority of guys I went out with, just because we didn't click in that way.  It sounds like you have a really high success rate for sexual chemistry.","1422749490"

&gt; 

Satoshi's words, in response to somebody saying ""You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography"":

&gt;Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled network like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.

A ""new territory of freedom"" would be a reference to all the restrictions banks place on money in the name of KYC/AML.

Also, he was deathly afraid of possible government reprisals that could have come from Bitcoiners supporting Wikileaks, and he disappeared when Gavin Andresen talked to the CIA.

Perhaps Satoshi's ""several years"" are up and the US government has caught up in the arms race, but it can't be argued that Satoshi was motivated primarily by the potential for merchants to avoid  credit card fees and chargebacks.

And despite there being hundreds of different looks for dogs, no one has a cat that looks substantially different. No one has bred one with floppy ears or twice as big (to hunt larger pests) or with longer legs to be faster or bigger jaws or high energy or low energy... There are many small improvements that could be made, and yet... cats are cats. All over the world, the lineage is almost identical. 

The difference between a golden retriever and a yorkie is unbelievable - everything from looks to life span, energy level, and temperament. Alaskan Malamutes would rather spend a night in a snowbank than on a couch by the fire, while a pug needs to wear boots and a sweater before going out in late fall. 

But then, look at munchkin cats - the cutest thing ever. If they could be bred that way, they would be. Clearly, there is a desire for cats that are different. But these don't breed true, and so they're not really a breed, but rather just a mutation that  can happen to any breed.

Even with the active circuit which likely outputs a low impedance signal relative to passive instruments, it is still a lot higher than that which audio gear is set up to receive.

Remember, too, that although the speakers may be powered, the mp3 player or phone also has its own preamp built in that probably has greater gain capabilities than that of a musical instrument's onboard one, if present.

"netsec","t5_1rqwi","So, You're saying that ZMap can scan the entire Internet in UNDER five minutes. 

Sweet!

Let's do some math here:

The IPv4 has 4294967296 address. The probe packet is 54 bytes. Total size of packets is 4294967296x54 that's 231928233930 bytes which is 221184MB (216GB). In 5 minutes? means 300 seconds right? the transfer rate per second is 221184/300 = 737MB/s. 

So, In theory, ZMap can probe the entire Internet in five minutes WITH a 6gbps connection. That's in theory, but still not correct, because there are incoming packets as a result of your probes, so the bandwidth should be split between sending and receiving if you're willing to receive results.

Moral of The Story, In order to scan the ENTIRE internet in UNDER five minutes, you need AT LEAST, a 10gbps internet connection!

I haven't seen a 10gbps connection used in homes.

"Twitch","t5_2s0fe","If I remember correctly the PS4 supports a 4-pin connector for both audio and voice to come through the same plug.

If that's the case, and you want one plug for audio to a dedicated headset, with another cable going to a separate microphone, you need this king of [cable.](https://www.google.no/search?q=3.5+mm+splitter&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t23NVJ6uMoSuPamVgBg&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#tbm=isch&amp;q=3.5+mm+microphone+and+audio+splitter&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=PHvSc-rBy8fODM%253A%3BNYmHeGVChd1TbM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.shoppingsquare.com.au%252Fimages%252Fproducts%252F47533.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.shoppingsquare.com.au%252Fp_400814_35MM_Audio_Mic_Earphone_Adapter%3B500%3B500)

This should make you able to connect the headset into the headset part of the adapter (green) and the microphone into the mic adapter cable (pink/orange).

They are all 3.5mm jacks, but remember that the plug going into the controller needs to be a 4-pin connector.

The best example of this kind (and correct kind) is what [Sennheiser delivers which I also use personally.

or alternatively, he could come in with the more modern, surreal nonsense anti-joke ""well now she has *two* pairs on!""  This is humorous because the audience would have thought, having seen her misadventures with the undergarments, that he had been treated to a ""beaver show"", if you will, but this sort of punchline deconstructs the viewer's assumptions about the sketch.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; What the fuck did Japan ever do to ANYONE in the middle east?

You are asking the wrong question. It doesn't matter to IS what you did, but who you are.

IS is set out to murder absolutely  everyone who is not either a) a Sunni muslim following their exact interpretation of Islam or b) a a follower of what is called a book religion in Islam (Christian, Jewish, possibly Zoroastrian), who is also willing to submit to their rule and pay the Jizya (a special protection tax for non-muslims who are considered followers of a book religions, to be paid to the caliphate).

Everyone else who does not fall into either of these two groups is a target for extermination. Shia muslims can only escape certain extermination if they convert to Sunni Islam (according to the IS interpretation of it) BEFORE they fall under the rule of IS.

Furthermore, every Sunni muslim who does not submit to the IS version of Islam is considered a murtadd (apostate) and will be killed immediately. Non-muslims of states who do not submit to IS rule are also also to be killed.

IS has been very clear about their genocidal ambitions.

Japan, being a non-monotheistic society, is a target for extermination by IS, no matter what their actual political stance on IS or politics in the Middle East is.","1422749499"

I had no idea what kind of fuel the car used and i looked everywhere(different papers and notes around the car) to find out if it was a diesel or gas, the car was a ford transit and i drive a ford myself so i figured it most likely used gas. I filled the the car and was about to close the  lid when i saw the biggest sign on the inside of the fuel lid ""DIESEL"". 
this was pretty much my face when I realized I'd fucked up.

The mail company had to waste money on  the flushing and the useless fuel, ""luckily"" the same day another delivery man forgot to put his hand break on and his mail car rolled in to a house, so that became the talk around the mail office.","1422749499"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","When the stock market hits the shitter, it's a great time to buy stock in companies that you know are going to survive.  If the price of Microsoft or Ford shares dropped 50% overnight because of an economy-wide 'shitstorm', you know the companies are going to survive &amp; regain value.  Anyone with enough money sitting around could easily buy them up and make a profit.

The same thing goes for real estate investing &amp; whatnot.

It'd be an amazing time to build a factory (or roads &amp; dams &amp; schools...) because the land &amp; labor involved would be much cheaper than it was before.  As long as you could afford to wait until the economy took off again, you'd save a bunch of money.

The catch is that you'd need to have enough money to ride it out.  As always, the rich get richer while everyone else gets fucked in the ass.  Regular Joe is forced to sell his house because the factory shut down &amp; he's out of work.  Some rich motherfucker buys it off him &amp; then starts renting it back to Joe when he gets a new job.","1422749500"

My total system uses about 140w under load and very little heat and noise. Don't listen to anyone who hasn't used or built a similar system. Name a game and you can play it with the right settings. Performs just like my Lenovo y410p with a gt 750m in it. I do plan on putting a handle on mine as well.

If you want to call their goal of power ""selfish ego"", then I guess you can but it's an inaccurate representation. I think you're making the mistake of personifying a state's actions. They were simply seeking power/security. The only way they could do that is by destroying our navy and gaining access to our resources. They tried. They failed. They would have also failed if they had never attacked us. Like I said, this was there only option. No state acts without an achievable goal in mind. I challenge you to name one exception.

For example, dual wielding axes.  Rather than the second part of axe #1 making you swing the main hand axe downwards, you instead swing the off hand weapon downwards.

Swords, you slice with the off hand once in a while.

Maces?  Club 'em.  It's just an animation, changes nothing from the original axe mainhand swipe down.


I would very much like to see the offhand dagger be used by a necromancer once in a while.  Otherwise she just flails her right arm around like mad, and lets the left one flop around other than once every 45 seconds.","1422749514"

"asexuality","t5_2qv0q","At least to my own definition, spot on! I'm a child of the Internet, and I've grown a taste for sex, but I still consider myself asexual (not interested in participating). 

For many people (myself included), it's very weird finding the asexual community and recognizing yourself as an asexual, when you still experience arousal and don't dislike the idea of sex itself. So it's a really nice little word that has the power to reaffirm some of us in our asexuality, helping us become a true part of the community. Sound silly but to me it's one of the most useful I've ever encountered.

For the wtfromantic, I learned it yesterday xD Basically it means that I do not perceive borders between friendship and romance. To me, there is no point where a friendship becomes something more. It's all friends in different degrees, with different rules and relationships.","1422749514"

Then at some point they stopped coming every game. It could be something like, once new account gets over ""x score"" then the regular supply drop chance happens. When people have a k:d of .001 cause of all the reverse boosting they have done and still don't get a supply drop every game, I don't see how it could be based on skill when the game is going to see them as having the lowest skill of anyone, but we never once heard a reverse booster talk about all their supply drops.

From 2 months ago I asked about this cause I was getting supply drop every game http://www.reddit.com/r/CodAW/comments/2nhndf/i_can_tell_you_how_to_get_a_supply_drop_every_game/cmdpat8

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Brawl was the first of many things for me. It was the first (and only) midnight release for anything I'd ever went to. It was the first ""tournament"" (gamestop lol) I had entered for a video game. And the result of that tournament and the sleepover following it resulted in the first time I ever fell asleep in class (it was just chinese school so no big deal lol). So for that, I give my respects, brawl represented a distinct period in my life, and I can't say I wasn't hyped out of my mind for that game.

I have a few stories in regards to the game. The first, was one before brawl was even released. A friend and I decided to make up a story about how there was a ""brawl demo"" being released on the wii and told all of our other friends at gym one day. As the days passed more and more people found out it wasn't real and obviously confronted us. At the end, only one friend remained absolutely clueless, and we kept taunting him about how amazing this new demo was and how much it blew melee out of the water. He believed us all the way until the gamestop midnight release/tournament, and imagine our faces when he actually won that tournament. 

The second story is more disappointing. After screaming our heads off and catching various things the gamestop employees threw out to the crowd--I got a super mario galaxy commemorative coin--it was finally midnight. We could get the game we were all looking forward to. It was like when harry potter had its 2ndary explosion after the 3rd book and everyone was looking forward to the new goblet of fire. We went home to a friends place and played brawl literally until 9 am when we had to leave. I remember distinctly that we somehow unlocked sonic within a matter of games, and I could never unlock him myself. But something was off. The more we played, the more it became clear. The game was slow, and you could airdodge out of ANYTHING. Before brawl, we regularly had biweekly sleepovers where we would play melee and talk about girls and do stupid shit all night. Brawl killed that. And for that I will forever resent that game. Even as a casual, the differences between the games were GLARINGLY obvious. I make this sound like it was a decision or realization that occurred overnight, but really it was over many months, I even attended a chicago local for brawl (it was finally my chance to play on even ground!! wopeee) and organized conference calls so we could play online. But the spark wasn't there. 

Brawl, was boring as shit. Fuck you sakurai.

* According to oanda.com, 1020 EUR buys 811.308 GBP.
* For 1000 EUR + a 20 EUR fee, Western Union say they will transfer 727.23 GBP to the destination.
* 727.23 / 811.308 = .896367348
* 1-.896367348 = .103632652 -- meaning 10.36%

(There must have been a rounding mistake in my previous calculation.)

Note that oanda.com takes the *ask price* for the GBP. If you exchanged currency with a friend, it would be fair to choose a [mid-price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_price), which would be a little lower than the ask price.","1422749516"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The lane wasnt terrible except that Sneaky could burst 80% of Piglets hp in one burst. This usually happened when Xpecial barely was out of position or tried to roam (Xpecial loves to roam). If they just relaxed and didnt try to do too much they could have just farmed up and let their mobile teamfight comp to win. 

Trouble was C9 outsmarted them in pick ban hard with the Lulu ban -&gt; using Liss flex pick first -&gt; baiting the Jarvan Gnar pick -&gt; instalock Kalista Annie -&gt; baiting Leona pick to counter and adc had no clue thinking Vayne at first then eventually Sivir -&gt; use the Liss flexibility to go Irelia against Gnar and round it out with Vi -&gt; Ahri counter but doesn't help much 

To answer your question for laning its like any losing lane just chill, think of it like a Janna Vayne lane. You just try to survive lane doing your best while getting poked hard. Dont leave Sivir by herself and dont get greedy being far out going for 1 or 2 more farm just wait till it pushes. Sivirs abilities make her autopush so dont use abilities. Annie wrecks early lane hence why support Annie has been nerfed a lot. Annie is super strong lvl 2 so hide but at 3-5 she doesnt get much so this is probably your best chance to do anything but their burst is probably too much. At 6 like you said its over. Out of laning you hope you have a Vi or something to get Kalista and you just use Sivir as a carry. If Sivir only has a Ghostblade then you are out of luck.","1422749518"

.


 Hey Professor (Dr?) Carroll...

I've  few nits to pick with the entry on Transcendental Meditation...

.

First, the TM organization IS a 501(c)3 not-for-profit org. The From 990 is available online. I've listed the 2012 Form 990s for all the major TM-related orgs in the USA that I can think of (there's relatively minor ones I didn't bother with). As you can see, the organization isn't super wealthy nor do the officers make wads of cash:

.

http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/043/043196447/043196447_201212_990.pdf

Maharishi Foundation USA. 

Net Assets: $4,182,012 Net Revenue: $805,586 Highest paid officers: Robert Cohn $42,000; John Hagelin $30,000

http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/364/364519393/364519393_201306_990.pdf

Global Country of World Peace. 

Net Assets: $48.6 million Net Revenue: -$1,985,695 Highest paid officer: Robert Wynne $30,000

http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/421/421315493/421315493_201306_990.pdf

Maharishi University of Management. 

Net Assets $37.6 million Net Revenue: -$543,030 Highest paid officer: John Hagelin $116,850; Keith Wallace $28,078 (note that Hagelin makes nearly 8x as much as the President Bevan Morris $15,000 and most professors receive minimal  stipends + room &amp; board and perks https://portals.mum.edu/RelId/663764/ISvars/default/default.aspx?RelId=663764#facultysalary)

http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990_pdf_archive/830/830436453/830436453_201306_990.pdf

David Lynch Foundation. Net Assets $2,763,392 Net revenue: $296,627 Highest paid officers: John Hagelin $42,000 Bob Roth $117,869


The largest assets in the TM organization are overseas in India, and the press enjoys covering the ongoing battle for who controls it:

http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/maharishi-mahesh-yogi-rs-60000-crore-fortune/1/201925.html

.

Controversies in India aside, it should be obvious from the IRS Forms 990 that the USA organizations are dedicated to doing what they say they are dedicated doing, and even the most ""flush"" of TM executives are middle class. You can see from the ""Maharishi Foundation"" revenues from previous years that the TM organization hit a low point, financially in 2009, the year the old monk died, with gross revenues of $3.726 million compared to gross revenues in 2012 of $12.26 million.

.

Second, the Skeptic Dictionary is kind of mocking about the involvement of TM in schools, but with the advent of the David Lynch Foundation, the TM organization gave up on trying to get schools to pay directly for TM instruction and instead accepts money from wealthy donors to teach TM for free to interested schools. About 500,000 students and other groups have learned TM for free through the David Lynch Foundation.

The success of the project in the US can be seen by this 7-year retrospective on how schools in San Francisco that teach TM are doing, released a month ago by NBC:
http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nightly-news/meditation-curbs-violence-at-san-francisco-schools-378464323951

Similar projects are on-going around the world. Various national governments have taken note of the striking changes in students in their own countries who learned TM (similar to those reported in the S.F. schools) and are now negotiating to have their own people trained as TM teachers. In Brazil, where President Rousseff herself practices TM, the government is talking about training 48,000 government employees to be TM teachers, one for each public school, so that all 45 million public school kids have the opportunity to learn TM for free.

In Africa, where 100 million people are thought to have PTSD, two recent pilot studies caught the attention of international relief agencies:
http://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/africa.html

The results convinced international relief agencies and NGOs to conduct their own research to see if TM really does have such striking effects on PTSD. The first such study will be published shortly, and the DLF now projects that by the end of 2018, about 10 million people will learn TM for free, taught by employees of public schools, prisons, relief agencies, etc., who have been trained to teach TM as part of their regular job.

.

Finally, TM research has been ongoing for 45 years. In 2013, the American Heart Association reviewed research on many forms of ""alternate therapies"" for hypertension. In their section on meditation, they said that TM was the only practice they could say that doctors could recommend to their patients as an  adjuvant  (secondary) therapy for high blood pressure, while all other forms of meditation failed to get a passing grade, pending further research:

http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/04/22/HYP.0b013e318293645f.full.pdf+html

[see summary on meditation, page 6]

This has prompted a greater interest in studying the health benefits of TM, and new studies, in collaboration with researchers who aren't TMers, are ongoing or about to start.

.



Anyway, just a few things to consider using to update your page on TM.

How is the community when it comes to dungeons? I played for a few months after launch/beta, but I was pretty busy so I didn't get to level 50 until maybe a month or two after launch. I was pretty damn good at playing my class, kept up with the best AMPs and tactics, consistently had the highest dps/most interrupts, but there wasn't a good resource for learning the dungeons at that time. Being on afternoons meant I played when the rest of the server was asleep, for the most part. It seemed that people already had established methods (ie, exploits) for running dungeons, and not a single group was willing to do boss fights the proper way without cheesing them. Nobody ever spoke up to say ""Hey, this particular mob should be interrupted."" If a single person died, they would all leave the group without a word because it wasn't a gold run anymore. It just felt like if you weren't there for that initial 2-week period where everyone was new and learning the dungeons together, you were fucked and could never get the chance to learn them properly because nobody wants to bother explaining a single thing about them. I don't need to be babied, but things were exceedingly hostile in the random dungeon environment here.","1422749523"
"keto","t5_2rske","I've never heard of keto chow but if you are just looking for fast unsustainable weight loss I suppose it would work. You will definitely lose some muscle with that amount of protein. It would be better to reprogram your brain to want the right foods for you while you also lose weight. It won't be as fast, but you might be able to continue your new healthy eating habits for the rest of your life. 

Drinking one chocolaty tasting shake throughout the day does not help you to learn to crave fat instead of sweets. It's a gimmick and will most likely not lead to healthy eating habits that will actually help you keep the weight off.","1422749523"

I think that is a kind of rash assumption. The thing with screenplays is that they have to be as concise and finely tuned as possible, considering the strict use of time available for both shows and films. Editing is key here. As probably most of the people here agree, Martin could sometimes really use a more strict editor. Sometimes his ramblings don't offer any narrative or thematic value to the storytelling. But the fact that he writes 1000-page tomes allows him to get away with this. I'm not saying the show or the books are better written, I'm just saying that stating that books are harder to write than screen-/teleplays is a fairly short-sighted comment. I get the sentiment, because Western culture has a history of iconophobia, but the fact remains that literature and television are just two very different beasts which can in no way be compared in terms of 'difficulty'.

Check credentials, ask around about him - email models who've worked with the person before. 

I am a female photographer and used to shoot fashion/model photography (mainly younger girls trying to break into the scene) I took every precaution to make sure the model (and her parents) felt comfortable.

Bad luck I thought, but nope, that wasn't the case.

I've spoken to other former members and they say the same thing. Everything was just ignored, and the same dull, repetitive photos and videos kept coming.

That's the central misunderstanding a lot of people have with Sarkeesian. People think her goal is rail off a list of games she thinks are **SEXIST**. They expend so much energy trying to prove her wrong by explaining why a certain game she brought up ""isn't actually sexist"". 

To them, sexism is only a thing that exists in ""sexist individuals"".  Hencewhy the Gator's favorite way to combat sexism is to loudly and repeatedly declare that they ""aren't sexist"". ","1422749529"

"Lyft","t5_2uz8x","What state are you in? Did you get the ticket in the same state you're licensed in?

Either way, the ticket will not disqualify you for Lyft, especially if it is the first. I was approved to drive for Lyft with 4 minor moving violations posted since 2011 (minor speeding and ""defective equipment"" which is how negotiated speeding tickets get disposed of in Colorado.)

Unless you can prove you're not guilty (the signs weren't properly installed, for example), your best course of action will be to contact the court about pleading guilty with an explanation. This is your fight. This will open the door for a plea bargain with the city attorney, who will probably offer you a reduced violation given it's your first moving violation in such a long time. Your clean driving record speaks to your safety; there's not much else you have to say.

Of course, this is very generic information, and you need to know what's done in your state. Maryland courts, for example, offer ""probation before judgement"" which basically lets you pay the fine and ""suspends"" the conviction, effectively not writing it to your driving record. This is offered to first-time offenders, and is available in other states too.

My advice: do contact the court about your options before sending in a check. I recommend you do *not* plead not guilty unless you really feel you can defend it in court. If you lose a not guilty plea, you'll get points, the max fine, and court costs (and a lost afternoon.) If the writing officer doesn't show in court, you may get an automatic dismissal, but that's not a safe bet.

If you're out of state, things are different. States all talk to each other now but they may not record a conviction on your home driving record. A plea bargain may be available by mail.

All things considered, if you waited until the court date to pay the fine, the conviction wouldn't be recorded until then. If you applied for Lyft now, it would be nowhere to be found...

Good luck! Learn your options and go in for the fight. You'll be okay to drive regardless. =)

Become more unavailabe. Randomly refuse to answer calls and texts and take some time, maybe even days, to reply. Act as if nothing's happenend. If she asks just tell her ""Was busy.""

When being out with her, compare her to other, more skinny women and exaggerate her looks. ""You are just so much sexier than her.""

See if your city has any local places that you can rent out for cheaper than an actual venue. You would have to cater yourself but you can do it cheaply if you plan it right. 

Don't forget about looking for cheaper dresses too, for bridesmaids and such. If you are ok with lower quality dresses check out aliexpress.com. I got one bridesmaid dress from there and overall turned out really great.

For most women, the attraction is in the mind not the body. While a 16-yr-old girl might have perky boobs and butt, she's never lived on her own and most often hasn't come to terms with her sexuality. Once a woman's been in the big, bad world a few days, the difference in confidence and capability is palpable.

The advantage is Nexus has way more mods available to load and it's better at managing load order. You can also get another program to manage your load order in Nexus, which is modified by users to ensure compatibility if possible. Overall it leads to an easier modding experience I feel, and superior end result.

&gt;

&gt;In [financial markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_markets), the __mid price__ is the price between the best price of the sellers of the stock or commodity [offer price or ask price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask_price) and the best price of the buyers of the stock or commodity [bid price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_price). It can simply be defined as the average of the current [bid and ask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_and_ask) prices being quoted.

&gt;In some cases, the mid price will be rounded up or down to the nearest ""tick"" (the nearest valid tradable price on the exchange system) for convenience purposes, and therefore not be the exact average.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","In the US, a movement to emphasize clarity and brevity in professional writing began after WWII, and accelerated somewhat with the similar ""Plain English"" movement in the 60's and 70's.  (I think something started in the 80's in the UK, but I'm not sure whether it developed).

The reaction (and in some cases, overreaction) against the passive in US English is part of this (although there are reasons not to use the passive in certain circumstances anyway).

Emphasizing clarity and brevity wasn't always the goal of English; Alexander Pope wrote in a Ciceronian style which was admired by a lot of people at the time. I've discussed this with some German academics, and, while this is anecdotal (although it corresponds with a lot of academic writing I've read in German), they tend to find a certain beauty and sophistication in not saying things with the simplest possible construction.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","I don't see what children have to do with it, but let me tell you a bit about that, as a father still married after almost 20 years to the mother of our children.

After you're done pumping in sperm for keeps (she's probably done having your children) her love for  you goes cold.  You are replaced in her affections by maternal love for the kids.  She does love the kids more than you and always will.  (I saw this with my own parents and some talks with my mother near her end of life, married over 50 years to my father.)

This is natural and normal.  The guy, evolutionarily speaking, is probably supposed to leave, kill mammoths, and find a new pussy for his next ejaculations, while the women raise the children.  But we value monogamy.

I just attended a 50th wedding anniversary for some people we know.  They've had a good and very interesting life (and maybe much more, their health is good.)  Someone asked him what it was like to be married to her for 50 years.  He said wearily that it didn't seem like a day over 49.

You still have this to come in terms of your experience, but in a world where things, time and emotions are limited, the devotion to children comes with costs.","1422749544"

If a deck is non-competitive it means that you can't reliable win with it, which means that it is non-functional. If you are consistently losing in quick play, it either means your deck is not good or you are getting matched with players that are better than you. 

If you don't want to play a meta deck, play a deck that can beat a meta deck. If you want people to gimp their decks so that you should feel ""encouraged"" to play more then you need to make an argument as to why people should care if you are ""discouraged"" from playing.","1422749546"

They want to hire people who will be focused on getting the job done. They do not want to hire people who will be in aw if Ortiz is warming up near them. Let me put it this way: If I were hiring, the last thing I would want to hear about is how much you love the team. I would, however, want to hear about how you are interested in preparing and working on a Major League field. 

At the end of the interview, they'll ask if you have any questions, tell them: ""I did a lot of research on this job, and the one thing that I couldn't find anywhere is pay. What's the standard (enter position title)?  

Source: Relative works high up in sports organization.

"eu4","t5_2uqat","If you're going for achievements in ironman,westernize early,it gives you the edge,and ally Austria,they're a very useful ally that you should try to keep unless you start to carry them through every war they fight. If that happens,ditch them for a better ally,I was lucky to get Bohemia from the start.Oh,and ally France after Austria,you'll need them.

Now,some basic tips


1.Do missions like ally and marry Lithuania before taking the ""take Warmia"" one,

2 . Feast upon Hungary. It's inevitable since they ally the Teutons,and they are your first target.Your targets should also be the Livonian Order,Riga,Wallachia and Serbia and co.

3.During the first war with the teutons,take Chelmo,Danzig and Warmia(have claims on all of them)

4.If you can keep the Jaggiellon dynasty,do it.They have better stats ,don't know if the same goes for a dynasty that already got elected once,I still keep the Jaggielons.

5.Take only what you have claims on,you're going to deal with rich provinces and conserving points is important,especially with Poland,since it gets events that increase tech cost

6.Don't change cultures,it's a waste with your traditions. Just get humanist ideas to deal with those.

7.Get influence ideas. They're good for you,since you're gonna have a lot of vassals(since you need adm tech 10 for the commonwealth and so you need adm points). You'll also find the +2 diplomatic reputation useful.

8.Get quality and aristocratic for the winged hussars

9.When you fight the Ottomans,make sure your armies and Lithuania's armies(if no commonwealth by that time) are double their armies and that you have the same(if not better)military tech level.If you,however have formed the Commonwealth,since you'll surely have more men than they do if you swallowed Hungary(at least 60k),you just have to catch them on another war in Asia and you win

10 . If you westernized,Russia will be easy(if you haven't tried to kill it early,in which case you should've been successful).

11.If you want an absolute monarchy,accept the privileges (you'll get it when you see the event), then wait for the Pacta Conventa to fire(think that was the name),and then around 1600 there should be an event where you have to fight thw rebels or pacifu the Sejm. If you want a monarchy,hope you can kill 127 rebel stacks

Well,that's it. If you make it past 1650,you're fine","1422749547"

2. I've never thought he was an asshole about it, but that's just me. It's mostly just envy IMO.

3. The ""deflated ball"" ""controversy"" was against the Patriots, which is why it became a big deal in the first place - any other team it would've been just a footnote, but the Patriots have Spygate as a blemish.

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","&gt; Yes, but when governments dictate a minimum wage this cannot be an option. People therefore lose their jobs.

At this point you not reading [the first link]( http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/09/why_dont_wages.html) is becoming an obstacle to discussion. The minimum wage is not a very important cause of downward nominal wage rigidity in the real world (to the extent that it does have an effect, it only affects people making somewhere near the minimum wage), it's largely because of psychological factors - from both employers and employees - that cannot be avoided. Not everything is the government's fault.

&gt; Preferable to who? 

Anyone who accepts the argument that falling real wages are less bad than unemployment in tough times.

&gt; America didn't become the greatest economy in the world during inflationary times. It built its economy during the 18th and 19th centuries which were overall deflationary periods of great growth and falling prices.

Deflation won't have much impact on long run growth, for better or worse. That's determined by real factors. Deflation just makes the short run more painful than it needs to be.","1422749553"

Even if you feel pressured to eat something that is hard to calculate, you can just choose the worst-case scenario and eat the loss.

That's good. Mine are too dopey to even do the running part. This person's dog was startled though and we don't know why it reacted the way it did, but, as I said, there's no suggestion anywhere in the legal filing that the dog even made contact, if indeed it even tried to bite.

&gt;The reason? it was properly trained to be non aggressive.

Fair one. The problem here is that she didn't run up behind your dog though, she ran up behind one of the other 525 million that exist in our world.

They aren't all going to be nice and chilled and when you live with dogs you know that simple rules help maintain balance.

&gt;Police dogs are only taught to be aggressive because it is a requirement for their job.

Not all, some.

&gt;Police dogs who inflict significant damage on non-aggressive individuals are put down and their operators are disciplined for failing to keep control.

I disagree. If the person has approached the animal and acted in a certain way they're no longer considered to be non-aggressive. They don't just put down animals that cost £12,000 to train because some eejit pulls its tail and gets a nip, y'know?

There are plenty of sources, links, articles, magazines, whatever you want on this matter. 

Secondly, given the secrecy surrounding executions the Islamic Republic gets away by labeling people with regular crimes while hiding the real reason. They have done this many times in the past, see for example [Zahra Bahrami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahra_Bahrami) who got a fake drug charge on her. Other political prisoners have been executed with fake charges, see [this](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/iran-carrying-out-secret-executions-disappearing-political-opponents/). See the [1988 executions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_executions_of_Iranian_political_prisoners) where a lot of people was executed purely for their political beliefs under cover of 'fake crimes':

---

&gt;The __gyrfalcon__ (*Falco rusticolus*) (/ˈdʒɜrfɔːlkən/ or /ˈdʒɜrfælkən/), also spelled __gerfalcon__, is the largest of the [falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon) species. The gyrfalcon breeds on [Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic) coasts and the islands of North America, Europe, and Asia. It is mainly a resident there also, but some gyrfalcons [disperse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration) more widely after the breeding season, or in winter. Individual vagrancy can take birds for long distances. The gyrfalcon is dispersed throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, with populations in Northern America, Greenland, and Northern Europe. Its plumage varies with location, with birds being coloured from all-white to dark brown. For centuries, gyrfalcon has been a precious hunting bird, highly valued among the Vikings. It is the national symbol of Iceland.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Is your argument that watches serve no functional purpose other than fashion, or that they serve no unique functional purpose other than fashion?

Because it seems you're making the case for the later, but saying your argument is the former. If your argument is the former, then clearly watches *do* have a functional purpose other than fashion: telling the time, which is something that you acknowledge they are good for.

So I am going to assume that your view is really ""watches serve no unique functional purpose, other than fashion"".

Watches do still serve some unique functional purposes, when the right contexts are considered. Here are a few:

How about checking the time when it's socially unacceptable, and/or otherwise impossible or impermissible to check another clock (including your phone clock)?

You're a college student, and this shouldn't be that unique of a situation, especially in smaller classes with professors who *really* don't like to see phones in class at all. For example, sometimes you have a test, and would really like to gauge how long you have or have been at it. Sometimes during said test, the clock in the room isn't functioning, or isn't readily visible from where you are sitting, or simply isn't present in the first place. How do you check the time? You wear a watch, that's how.

Another example of this case I can give you from when I was in college was when I was working as a tutor. For one on one sessions, it's pretty helpful to be able to gauge the time you have left and the pacing of the session, so that you can wrap things up relatively neatly and on time. Constantly pulling out a phone to check the time is distracting for a lot of students, not terribly professional, and much more inefficient than just checking a watch (and laying a phone on the table is even more distracting, with incoming texts, emails, and other alerts).

Or how about a different case, checking the time when you're not conveniently located near civilization / an applicable power source? If I'm on a 5-day backpacking trip, I am going to turn my phone off, because I need to conserve the battery. Turning it back on just to check the time and get an idea of the actual pace is pretty silly, then turning it back off again is pretty silly, and significantly detracts from the phone's primary purpose during this period of time (which is for emergency use only, during which, you will want as much battery power as possible remaining). Checking a watch is much more efficient, and does not detract from the primary purpose of your phone.

I'm also not necessarily convinced that the end goal of fashion can't be construed as a functional purpose. As a species, we're pretty obsessed with status, and clothes/jewelry can have a large impact on that perception, which in turn can have a pretty large impact on how other people treat you. It's certainly harder to quantify, but if you wear a watch that in part suggests high-status, people will treat you more favorably.

"TomorrowWorld","t5_2we8h","Dreamville is the name of the camping area at TW. There are different sections to Dreamville, though.

There is general camping, where the vast majority of the 40,000 attendees reside during the festival. This is basically a free for all. Where you set up your tent is totally dependent on when you arrive. There aren't really marked off camping spots so most groups end up pretty much on top of each other (we're talking tents literally touching). This area is referred to by some as ""gen pop"" or  ""District 9"" if you've ever seen the movie it's really a good description.  It costs $60 for a Dreamville pass, with the Full Madness ticket, total is $407+fees.

The Easy Tent and Dream Lodge sections (they are not together, easy tents is one section, dream lodges another) are housed within Dreamville, but each has its own entrance area where your wrist band must be scanned. This prevents people who have not purchased an easy tent or dream lodge but are staying in Dreamville from accessing those areas. People who purchased easy tents or dream lodges can access all the rest of Dreamville and hang out in general camping as much as they want. Currently, 2 person easy tent packages are sold out and only 4 person easy tent packages are available. These run $602/person. 

In my honest opinion the extra money for easy tents is 100% worth it if you are flying to Atlanta and don't have the option of bringing a bunch of camping equipment. It is also 100% worth it if you would like some sort of comfort. All of the stuff is set up for you when you get there and you can choose to take it home with you if you want, or you can choose to just leave it (so right there you've got the convenience of not having to carry in, set up, and then break down and carry out all of your equipment. This is important because it is a LONG walk from the parking lot, often referred to as the trail of tears). In addition to avoiding the extra work, you get bathroom trailers with real toilets and sinks (as opposed to porta potties in gen pop which get absolutely horrific as the weekend progresses), showers are included in the price (as opposed to 2 tokens/shower in gen pop), and there are food vendors in the easy tent area (as opposed to walking a mile to the marketplace). You get to keep the tent, air mattress and sleeping bags that come with the easy tent package, and since they are all set up by the TW staff each easy tent is regularly spaced and not right on top of the tent next to it.

If you live closer to the Atlanta area, or are planning on driving to TW, and you already have a bunch of camping equipment, and you don't mind some extra work and some nastiness, then save your money and get general camping (the Full Madness+Dreamville ticket). If you don't have equipment or it's difficult to bring it with you, or you are very particular about your hygiene and bathroom facilities, I'd suggest going with the easy tent option. The tents and air mattresses and sleeping bags alone are worth the extra money you'll spend if you decide to keep them, and the convenience, in my eyes, is priceless.

I heard a ton of horror stories from people in general camping about how filthy and disgusting it was and how bad the porta potties and showers were and how they never had toilet paper and how terrible some people's neighbors were. I didn't have any of those complaints while staying in the easy tents and I'm planning on doing that again this year.

When you take that really rough poop on Sunday morning after 3 days of debauchery and less than adequate nutrition and water intake, you will be very happy you spent that extra money, I guarantee it.

Go to The Gear Page if you need more info. They probably have a larger knowledgeable community there. They try every tube for no reason other than they are never 100% happy with their sound, and they seem to have too much time and money to waste on guitars and gear.

You should save all the transformers too. Just take the entire chassis out. Some people may want the chassis and transformers.

You will need a multi-meter if you want to find out if the tubes are still usable.

Re-bias your amp if you use the power tubes. The preamp tubes will be good for any tube amp. 

It is posible the tubes are worth a little money, but not much even if New Old Stock. Again, I think they are Russian, not RCA, GE, Sylvania, Tung-Sol, Raytheon, Ken-Rad, or Mullard.","1422749572"

Who was this man to come in to his home and refuse his drink and his roof. For a short insane second he thought about beheading him there and then, returning the favour for Galbert but that was just the bit of his father in his brain talking. He could do it though, they hadn't broken bread inside. Guest right hadn't been invoked.

He could hear the murmurs of the crowd gathered and saw that many of his men had armed themselves. The twenty men on the walls had their bows drawn and both his brothers had unsheathed weapons. But Elric raised his hand. A simple gesture saying don't do anything.

He eyed Moose. ""I hope you have a good reason for returning my envoy's head like this. Speak quickly for you have wasted my patience with your bread and salt farce"" ","1422749573"

Either way, I have tried to avoid it as much as I can because the whole thing has seemed so ridiculous in the grand scheme of things. 

So, here are the main points, I guess:
1.  Sexism is bad.  I am not sure why this still has to be argued.  
2.  Whether you call yourself a blogger or a journalist, you should disclose your conflicts of interest.  To do otherwise ruins credibility.
3.  There is no such thing as a gaming community, anymore than there is a  TV watcher community. There is a group of people with a similar hobby and have some similar interests, but other than that, there are as many opinions about games as there are games.  To lump them all into a community is a marketing shorthand that really has no relevance outside a small subset of the overall group.","1422749574"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt;The only sources we have for how strong the in lore thu'um is the ancient nords, and they're incredibly biased.

That's just simply not true. The Thu'um is mentioned in various different contexts. One example from a slightly more reliable source would be the Sermons of Vivec. 

Also here's how I read that statement:

&gt; Those parts of lore hurt my position so I'm just going to ignore them. 

But you don't get to do that and on a whole you don't get to ignore things in TES citing things like bias. That's ridiculously ignorant to the way the lore is developed. There are numerous examples in the lore of the Thu'um doing ridiculously powerful things like [Barfok destroying strongholds, Ysmir throwing cities into the sea](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_9), and [Miraak and Vahlok tearing Solstheim from the mainland](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Guardian_and_the_Traitor) 

MCU Thor has not displayed anywhere near that level of power and has many examples that he would get thoroughly destroyed by much less.

He's coming back for us. ""Grinding"" they call it. Something about our hides making the best armor. No remorse, no pity, no guilt. Like so much chaff before him. He swings the blade. We die. But not for much longer...

The elders grew smart. Realizing we could never really hide from them. Instead, we set up fake villages. Populated them with our friends and family, and prayed they would last. They didn't. But for every village found, our caves went unnoticed. We hid in our caves while those around us suffered...

Not for nothing though. It turns out their precious ""system"" could be used against them. None of them read the rules it seems. Nothing was stopping us from ""grinding"" ourselves. We found other groups we could hunt. Only the strongest were allowed to participate. Battle after battle, war after war, all in secret.

The day he came for my village was just like any other. The swing of a blade, bodies dropped. But we were ready. In the distance a faint sound grew.

This is contradictory to the official dispute you filed with us.


&gt; I understand him in not trusting me [I wouldn't trust me either if I were him, 99.9% of hackers, were hackers.] 

It has nothing to do with ""trust"", its clean cut, the stats show you have cheated twice thus you have been banned a twice (1 week ban then perm ban).

&gt;I was digging around finding my files that I wanted to keep, and I ran a search for [.mp4|.mp3|etc. media files], and in there I seen some more footage I must have taken of that match. The initial youtube upload HERE [2] shows only 1:00 minute of gameplay. Now obviously I could have turned off my cheats before the last minute. In a sheer chance of luck I did find more footage from that game, so as I am typing this I'm currently using the professional tools at my disposal [Windows Movie Maker] to throw the two 4:00 minute clips and the original 1:00 minute clip into one video, and I'm going to upload it in a private link for you guys on YouTube. I'd really love to get help with this issue, as you can see I was not hacking, and the whole reason I've started upgrading my PC WAS for Battlefield 4, when this new CPU arrives, I won't get to do what I really wanted. So I'm hoping someone here could help me.

We work on a delayed ban system so it is very likely it wasn't your last match that caused the ban. The issue about uploading footage (and edited footage at that) is that 1. Most cheats have the option to hide ESP etc in videos. 2. It is hard to date and time the footage, it could have been record at any point. 3. Its an edited video, you could easily remove anything that maybe slightly suspicious.

At the end of the day you chose to cheat and even after your first ban you tried to continue to ""play under the radar"" it didn't work and you have lost the privilege to play BF4 online with others. ","1422749580"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","WotC's never figured out that reprints of high value cards need to come out *frequently* and in *very small numbers*, like 1-2% of the current supply per year.

Their problem is that they want to package these cards in big, marquee products, in order to sell large-print-run sets. They can't do that, though, because they have *years* in between these sets, but they don't want the immediate impact to be too high. So it's like a roller coaster.

Most recently, with Modern Masters, after the huge ominous multi-story climb on the first hill (clack, clack, clack), the players got a glimpse over the top, expecting a commensurate drop, only to be disappointed/relieved to see about a 10-foot hill followed by a much more slow climb.

Then they realized it was a ski lift, not a roller coaster.

And no one pointed out that they really should be looking for an exit ramp instead.

Prior to the 1980's,  FCC monitoring posts across the US were staffed 24/7, actively monitoring for violations.  Now I understand the monitoring posts are remotely controlled and are only brought online when there is a specific complaint of a violation. By having lax enforcement the  FCC is unwittingly sending a message that violations of radio laws are not as important as they used to be.  Can you blame anyone for receiving that implied message and then forming an opinion that anyone who still believes in the rule of law is just an old cumudgeon?","1422749584"

If a pickrate is consistently low then calling it a trend will not be an argument that a hero doesn't need a buff, because niche picks have to work on their own, a good example is how Synd explains that picking Techies didn't exactly work in favour of having Techies picked more since any hardlaner could have done the same thing. Naix also is only picked by Newbee at Tier 1 matches, a good hero shines at least as a niche pick, given how counterable and unreliable a position 1 naix is, we are not calling for a huge buff for these heroes, but rather some stats or scaling changes.

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","I played DA:O when it was new, and there was a lot to like about it.  There was a lot to dislike, too-- I was one of those who felt that it fell short of what Bioware had accomplished with the BG series.  (Although a huge improvement over Neverwinter Nights.)

The RPG mechanics were scaled back in scope from the AD&amp;D ruleset they had previously used, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  But with a more focused scope, you would hope that the class/ability balance would've come out better.  And, failing that, the game really should've given the player clear information about what each ability did (i.e., show me the math).  With only vague descriptions and no opportunity for re-spec, character building in the early days was a lot of frustrating guesswork.  (Fans cracking open the game files and developing mods fixed this eventually, but it shouldn't have been necessary.)

I absolutely hated the importation of an MMO-style ""threat"" mechanic.  The combat would've been soooo much more satisfying if you protected your squishies via effective tactical positioning with some kind of Engagement or AoO mechanic, rather than making all enemies idiotically default to attacking the biggest lump of metal (or rock!) they see and allowing Fighter classes to learn unexplained mind-control powers.  The gameplay was OK, overall, but it could've been great.  It also got tedious at the end.  I offed my first Warden at the endgame largely because of how sick to death I was of the gameplay by the time I plowed through all the waves of samey Darkspawn on the way to the Archdemon.

As for the writing, it was disappointingly conventional.  Hints of interesting-ness and ambiguity in the setting and in the better side-quests (mostly Orzammar), but the core storyline was one of unambiguous good defeating unambiguous evil.  Yawn.  The best writing in the game (which was really good, by the way) was all the lore hidden in Codex entries that few people actually read.  (Also, Sten.  Largely because he was mostly a walking Codex entry on the Qun, one of the more weird and interesting bits of backstory that Bio put in the game.)  ","1422749589"

"Netrunner","t5_2td0c","I feel like, as runner, if you put +Handsize hardware, IHW, and Plascrete all in the same deck, then you DESERVE to be pretty safe from meat damage flatlines.

In general, if there is a particular strategy you are worried about, you can put enough cards in your deck to not have to worry about that strategy.  So far, Fast Advance is really the only strategy that doesn't have enough card-support to counter it, [part of why it has been so popular] and that is probably going to change once we get Clot.

So no, I don't feel like this is a bad change.  (or even much of a change, honestly - there are no shortage of other anti-meat damage cards even without IHW...)

2. Depends on where you live. Generally $10/gram is ""good"" where I live (Northeast). 

3. I'm 6' 130lbs. My first time smoking I probably had .2 or .3 g and I was higher than the clouds the whole night and most of the morning. Generally you'll want to start off slow. Smoke a little bit, see how you feel, smoke more if you please :)

4. Pipes/Bongs/Glass *generally* use less weed. I say generally because some pipes have massive bowls that will be way too big for your first time. When I started smoking, I would ask the guy I picked up from to roll all my weed into joints (I couldn't roll back then). Most of them are happy to do it, at most they'll ask for like $5 extra (mine did once). Joints/blunts are generally regarded as the most wasteful method of smoking, since the end stays lit and some smoke escapes off the end. The reason people like both is because they each give you a different type of high (for me, blunts and joints give me a very heady high, where as glass is an all-around body high). 

5. **Inhale**. I was lucky enough to smoke with some pretty experienced stoners my first time, and that was the #1 thing they taught me. A good way to make sure you're inhaling the smoke is to take a hit, then take another ""hit"" of fresh air to make sure the smoke goes all the way down into your lungs. 


Overall, I'd say just go into it with an open mind. Weed is an amazing thing but it's not for everyone. Make your own decisions about it and you'll enjoy your stay in the land of the trees :)

I come from a lower middle class family and had to take out loans to go to an out of state school (no school in my state).  I had to take out the full loan amount to help pay for cost of living.  I graduated with 200,000, due to interest it is now 250,000 and I graduated 5 years ago.  I am on income based loan repayment, forgiven after 25 years but then you pay tax on that.  What I pay now doesn’t even dent the interest.   If you go to an instate school on all loans and work as a gp, might not be that bad, but if you are single, things will be tight.  Assume 60-70,000, minus 20% or so for taxes and 10,000+ a year in loan repayments (on regular payback).  Doesn’t leave you with a lot to play with.  I am 35 years old and I still live like an undergrad.  I don’t own a house, my car is 20 years old, I can’t buy new clothes and I don’t go on vacation.  

I worked a lot during undergrad and grad school and was able to do well acadmically.  I would have not been able to work during vet school (I looked for work during summers but w/o success).  In your first 3 years you are in class about 40 hours a week and then really have to study every night to keep up (much different than undergrad).  Your school may have teaching animals that you are expected to help care for as well.  Once senior year comes around you cannot work.  You need to be available 24/7.  Additionally, many of the fun extracurricular activities take place at night or on the weekends.

Vet school websites list their cost of attendance, which goes up every year. Also consider cost of living around the vet school.  It is much easier to live in Ames, IA than Davis, CA (sperlings best places, good place to compare).  

I love having the knowledge that I have but vet school is the worst financial decision I ever made.  I was deciding between vet school and med school, should have went with med school even though people are gross.  If there is anything else that you think you wouldn’t mind doing, then do that.  RNs make about the same or more than a new grad going into small animal practice.  Nurse specialists and physicians assistants make more than most vets. Vet schools keep increasing their class size and new schools keep popping up.  There are too many vets.

"EvilBrainstorming","t5_2wi11","the problem is, if he has not done anything to you.... it is not revenge. It is being a douchebag. 

Not that being a douchebag is not fun. But what you are looking for, for the perfect evenge, is something that answers every step of his way. that is disposable, and incrimintating, and that allows you, even if you are caught, to stand there, and go, what are you looking at me for? wouldn't you have reacted the exact same way? 

From an adult standpoint, it makes sense to tell the nice policeman if your ""friend"" is getting himself in trouble. you will not meet a single adult who disputes that. 
But from a still mentally young point, you have the version of the tattle tale. 

So, your big excuse, when caught, should be, ""I know I am kind of unpopular, but he, the one that got caught with 4 kilos of grass in his jeep, was allways nice to me. I did nbot want to have anything bad happen to the boy. ""

The big picture is, that with things like ""lets ruin his college application"", you count on not being caught. Because as an adult, I can tell you one thing: 

This could have a huge influence on his life. 

So, the one thing you have to watch is, is it really worth it? Can I make this seem understandable and logical to an adult? 

Just as an example: 

Lets say he calls your friend a crispity, crackly coon; a jerry curled schwarzer, and a jungle bunny, whose big black bubba lips got blisters from sucking on the wellfare crackpipe for too long.

Now, most people would freely understand if you do something of equal cvalue, and for example call him an inbred wellfare baby that is not able to wipe his own ass because for most of his life his daddy has been paying all his bills, and that he is trying so hard to come out of his daddies shadow that it seems ridicullous to a lot of people, when he is notr busdy fucking his sister to keep the bloodline pure. 

Most people, on the other hand, would not understand it if you shot his dog for this. 

This is why there can be no general reven ge plan. No, this is a cool way to take revenge. 

Revenge, that means a bloody vendetta, where blow is weighted up with the responsive blow. If he destroys your bagpack, and then gets caught ""Stealing"" from your bagpack, then hell, people will understand the response. But much more importantly, he will not be able to complain, without looking like a stupid oaf. 

I could get you a couple of dozend ideas in your direction, but without that initial spark of what he had done to you, I would say most of them would put you in more danger then put hiom in embarassment. 

So, if you want more, write specifics on what he did.

But, for immediate relief I grab a tennis ball or a lacrosse ball and sit on it. Yup, just plant your booty right on it and hold 30-60 seconds. Right in the meat of it. It sucks and it hurts but then you stand up and woohoo it's feeling better. Also lay on your back and put your legs in the air. Pretend to do bicycle motions. That's the repetitive movement everyone is talking about. You may find you need a pillow under your lower back for support reasons with his.Then you should try to get yourself a foam roller ( target, walmart, dicks sporting goods, etc) and roll your IT Band ( side of your thigh). If you can't afford one or need immediate relief lie on your side and have your husband rub oil or lotion on your thigh (outside) and use his knuckles and light pressure to work the band.

I know you wanted to avoid the football museum (one can always learn something in a museum even if the topic isn't one's favorite, btw) but you should have put your own sociality first (knowing you're socially challenged and not good at reading texts/finding places....don't do this to yourself!)

They didn't stay that long at the museum.  You would have had a lovely day - and as it was, they were probably irritated having to wait here and there to try and catch up to you (it does get wearing, and when the people aren't your family, you can't expect as much from them - you need to *make* friends, not challenge them).

But don't worry.  There will be lots of other chances.  Next time, stay with your group.  Don't be quite so picky.  Put up with an hour of an activity that the rest of the group wants to do and soon they'll be honoring your input (instead of seeing you as the difficult one who can't remember plans or read texts).  

I agree that choosing simpler social plans would be good - but look how much you learned from this more complex one?  You *can* go to new cities with new friends, you can learn to do this - but again, do what many of us do when dealing with ADHD and stay together with your group until things are more cemented and everyone knows your quirks better.

The sunken one is either part of the water or landmass, I forget. The HC/FZ UFO have their own bubbles that are part of the city model. This is the ""forcefield"" you can stand on. Basically a collision box for the UFOs to sit in. That's why they will never fly or move from their spot. The spots they're in cause the effect, while the UFOs do the noise/weapon/light/force effects. My guess from what I know of how it all works is that because the HUD effect comes from the collision thing and not the UFO within it, it would take changing stuff in the map to remove it. Instead they just more or less copied the sp map for mp, so the effect and sunken UFO stayed. Rather than removing the effect of the collision model and the sunken UFO. ","1422749602"

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","I'm 23, and for the past ten years my biggest insecurity has been my skin.  
  
The first thing I feel like mentioning is that my skin is beyond sensitive. It's incredibly easy to mark. Scratching my skin after a shower will make it look completely mutilated. A light hickey will look like a gunshot wound. I think this is one of the reasons why my facial skin is like it is, and I've gone through so many years being insecure about it. My biggest issue has always been discoloring, particularly under my eyes. Back in high school there was a night I hadn't slept well, and other students asked if I had been in a fight, because it looked like I had gotten a black eye.  
  
Acne has never been a problem, but I've got some very noticeable blackheads on my nose, which is also, coincidentally, constantly red. I've never really used any proper skincare products, but as an adult now, I'm getting tired of using makeup to avoid looking like a junkie. Googling gave me a million different results, and with no expertise or reference, I thought I'd come here. The things I *have* tried would be drinking high volumes of water, getting proper sleep and cleaning my face. While those things do help to some degree, it's never anything major.

One is from the point of view of a random throwaway character and one is from Brienne, who we've followed and care about.  It's a no-brainer to me to delay the LSH reveal until the scene with Brienne; it will make it more impactful.  This improves Brienne's whole storyline too because you can build up the mystery of the hangings over the course of her riverlands journey and then cap it off with the LSH reveal and her hanging Brienne.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; Your wikipedia article doesn't back your original claim that the overwhelming majority of violent crime in general is committed by males. Not only is it limited to one specific, narrowly defined category of violent crime,

Yes, murder: generally speaking the most violent of violent crimes, the crime most diligently pursued, and the violent crime with the best available statistics.

&gt; ... it also mischaracterizes its source's source, as according to feminist arguments on the topic of sexual violence, the Justice department tracks convictions, not perpetration, and is therefore not a source for perpetration stats."" 

If what you say about DOJ statistics is true, yes it only reflects convictions, but convictions, at a 9 to 1 ratio, is sufficient to  prove males are 9 to 1 more likely to murder unless you want to argue that female murderers are not found as frequently as male murders are, or are not as diligently prosecuted when found. 

Either way you have to show your argument true (or even likely to be true), you cannot just hand wave and say that it is. 
 
&gt; That is, unless you're willing to abandon all feminist-quoted stats on sexual violence in favor of the Justice Department's 1 in 820 stat.

Murder and rape are very different crimes: where someone has been found, and deemed to have been the victim of a homicide, there's an investigation; where a rape is reported the police and prosecutors, generally, cannot be bothered to investigate and/or prosecute (presumably for the difficulty, lack of resources and success rate).

About unnecessary male violence in war: no, I don't concede your point; the practice of rape in a war setting is as old as war is.

Here is a relatively recent, and especially egregious, example: http://tinyurl.com/3xfugjk

""Estimates of the total number of women raped during the (Bosnian) war range from 12,000 to 50,000."" 

http://tinyurl.com/mwu9epzar

There's more, much, much more, but you have the opportunity to take the point, or show it not true, by now.

Elsewhere, and fortunately for your argument, what constitutes ""violence"" in all your other cites lack detail - those that are available anyway (archive.acf.hhs.gov/ fails to load); one can, however, gain a perspective of what is deemed ""violence"" in these cites by reading 

""In other words, 67% of one-way intimate partner violence was female perpetrated.""

One cannot help but be left with the impression that, for some (political?) reason 'harsh language', or its like, is deemed to be ""violence"".

One can curse, wiggle, deny, or cite cotton candy, but the fact remains: there are 9 male murderers for every female murderer.

I always help the offcoming nurse tiding my patients up. 2 is better than one. Once a nurse was hesitant to help me as I was finish my shift and I made a very obvious ""request"" that he help. Which he did. But his mannerism clearly showed this was an ""inconvenience"" to help. Which was bullshit. my shift was over. i wasn't getting paid anymore.

Reduced mana - Conductivity - Arc, will get swapped for HoT when one drops.

Arc - Faster casting - Lightning pen - Spell echo, in Geofris for +1

"gaming","t5_2qh03","This brings up a good point. I've been playing Skyrim (actually attempting to do story stuff this time rather than just sandbox around as a thief/murderer and actually trying to stay realistically chaotic-neutral) a lot recently after playing nothing but ARMA 3 for nearly a year.

I'd just started missing ARMA for the hell of it to mess around with single player before moving onto Skyrim and I thought modding ARMA had its complications! Jeez! 

The point is, I just started modding Skyrim for the first time ever these past couple of weeks and even after ARMA modding taught me the importance of load orders, conflicts, and even basic scripting and C++, this post has made me come out of my state of being jaded and actually made me realize and come to terms with the fact that modding Skyrim actually is scary :(

 It's a huge job and I feel like there are still so many placebos and fixes out there for me to sort through. I've tried everything out there and I still get freezes and random CTD's, even with two different types of ""memory fixes"" that didn't solve the issue. I have an i5 4690k Haswell, 250GB Samsung EVO SSD, 8GB RAM, and an MSI GTX 970 4GB. It's almost to the point where I've just accepted that I'll have to play with random freezing and crashing, even though I've turn d off pretty much every interesting mod that may be script heavy and limited myself to mods that alter textures or models of the environment and characters. I would almost be willing to pay someone to install the game for me, fix my issue, or tell me how to get the most bang from Skyrim graphic-wise with my system and not crash.

Just in-case someone can help, I'd like to note that one issue I've noticed even with my grids set to 7 is bad LOD on distant trees. They can't be more than 200 meters or so away from me and the trees turn from blocks/square textures into trees in front of my very eyes, sometimes with a stutter. I'm using pure vision ENB, followed a video guide that was an hour long to install it along with its recommended addons, and have a few other popular addons for characters, armor, and weapons but stayed away from anything that changed the bones. My uGrids is at 7 as I'm using a modified version of the ENB's recommended ini's and this is my second or third install, first being Real Vision and the second, third, and so-on has been Pure Vision. I use BOSS, LOOT, Nexus, TES5Edit, and Wyrebash (sp?).

[EDIT] Apologies for getting carried away. I know this is off-topic and there's a sub-reddit for this sort of thing, I've just been frustrated and I guess I had to vent lol. I didn't mean to seem like I'm trying to beg for help or hijack the thread.","1422749624"

Basically in your story you assumed the close and held frame in the face of some ridiculous LMR's.  Read up on the PUA literature on LMR's.  You may need nuclear level tactics on her LMR's.  Lord have mercy.

&gt;I threaten to get the duct tape out if she doesn't shut up

Now that's what I'm talking about.  Hold frame.  Blow through the LMR.

&gt;She was asking what was wrong with me several times...

Again, hold frame.  Hold it to the bitter end.  I think there is a good chance you are at least over the hump meaning it could get better from here on.

There could also be a period of testing by her.  Of course that is best minimized by continuing to assume the close and keeping her fucked good and hard.

Currently the biggest windmill is 164m in diameter. As material silence, structural and flow simulation get better this will get beaten.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Animated Films have more detail (more voxels, which are 3-D pixels, if you didn't know), lighting effects, shaders, etc. As others have mentioned, some 3-D animated movies from as far back as the early 90's outdo many games today. Games are optimized to run on consumer grade hardware, animated films are created on workstations that might be more expensive than your car, and are designed to run on 4k theater resolutions. A modern 3-D animated game  title only has to run on, at minimum, a $350 piece of hardware.

For Example:

Toy Story 3 Movie:
http://trailers.apple.com//705/us/media/galleries/disney/toystory3/toystory3_img10_720.jpg

Toy Story 3 Game:
http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4563716417_1fddd7cee0.jpg

Pretty big difference if you ask me.

tl;dr:
Games have to run on consumer-grade hardware, and render based on actions in the game. Movies are made and pre-rendered on professional-grade workstations, with more power, therefore, they can have more detail, but take longer to render.

"ShingekiNoKyojin","t5_2we2n","I think Rod's implication here is Eren needs to die, because you need to destroy his CNS and kill him. That's why he's telling her it's not simply ""eating Eren"" (she could bite his arm off), it's why it's ""bite through his spine"".

Yes, you can take out someone's spinal fluid and they'd be okay, but try delivering that 10mL of spinal fluid to a mindless Titan. They'll eat you for sure. There's no safe way to approach Titanstoria, *and* you're letting a mindless Titan rampage through your Walls because you cannot afford to kill her.

Besides, if everyone has already figured out that spinal fluid can be extracted without killing the host, why would everyone automatically assume that the Reiss family didn't also think of this? A lumbar puncture can produce 10mL of fluid, but what if it requires 150mL all at once?? We only know what Rod tells us, and he has admitted exactly the opposite of ""I've told you everything I know"".

I would hate for the dramatic tension to simply be solved by ""hey, gosh, silly we can just stick a needle up Eren's spine and feed that to Titanstoria! Heck, why don't we all just become Titans and inject each other with Eren's spinal fluid and we'll all have the Coordinate power too!""

You all obviously sound like very intelligent and tech savvy people, I want to propose some steps you might try to get the ball rolling.


First of all you are in possession of the greatest tool humans have ever created: the Internet.  You literally have the resources to learn everything there is to know about Social Anxiety Disorder.  Even if some of the information you need is behind paywalls chances are you can obtain a copy of the information from other sources online, digital copies of textbooks, lectures, and even the DSM can be found at no cost.


I say this especially to those of you that cannot afford or cannot push yourself to see a psychiatrist or psychologist.  Become an expert on your disorder, research what types of symptoms and types you personally exhibit, learn more about your particular flavor of SAD than even an accomplished psychologist does.  Learn which treatments there are both counseling and medications.  Make a game plan then find a way to get the specific help you need.  Generally a psychiatrist needs to see you only once to get a diagnosis and write a prescription and many will agree to refill so long as you see them a couple of times a year and explain the other less expensive forms of counseling you have found.

There's a wealth of avenues you can take for counseling and ways to utilize the techniques you have researched.  You could find a friend or family member that you are comfortable with and teach them what you need, you could find someone to help you via a support forum, somewhere you can communicate via text so you can  remain anonymous and avoid triggering your anxiety.  Please don't ever give up!","1422749634"

They had a donation drive a while back and I gave them... I think it was $35-ish. They sent me a cute little talking plush version of their mascot as a thank-you.

Also, I own tons of indie T-shirts and have bought books from some of my favorite online comic strip artists, like Randall Munroe's XKCD.

This thread has the facts.  No BS.  For your freakin buddy, OP, here's the story on eating the thing.  With a bonus explaination why no ketchup.

++++++++++++++++

A Chicago dog is all beef Vienna brand. Heated in warm water, never boiled. Set into a Mary Ann brand sesame bun. 

You order it ""gimmie a dog with everything."" This gets you all of the following: a thin line of mustard, a spoonful of nuclear green relish, a spoonful of diced raw onion, a dash of celery salt, a slice or two of tomato, a quarter spear of dill pickle, two sport peppers. A good counterman does this with a graceful dance, puts it down on a paper square, rolls it, and hands it to you with a smile. All in 15 seconds.

Unwrap the dog as soon as you can. It has been sitting in hot water and is quickly turning the bun to mush. You can take off the sport peppers (little green pepper shaped things) unless you know what they are.  Also you can set aside the dill pickle slice.

Hold the dog up in one hand and push down the tomato slice(s) with the index or third finger of the hand holding the dog. Or a finger from your other hand. Graceful like.

The reason the tomato was sitting up high is the stiff bun at first would break if the counter man pushed it. Now that the bun is softened by the dog, you can slide the tomato down a little bit.

Nibble the end of one of the sport peppers to see how/if you like the kick. If it is OK, push one or both back next to the dog. If it is too spicy, take a bite of the dog to sort of rub off the burn.

Eat the dog from the end that's sticking out from your fingers. So the uneaten end is sort of cupped in your hand. That gives you good control of the thing in case it starts getting messy.

Nibble the dill once in a while if you took it out. Take time to notice and appreciate the contrasting sensations of warm, cold, soft, snap, sweet, sour, bland, spicy. Time the pickle nibbles to end with the butt end of the dog &amp; bun. You can leave the pickle on, but you risk poking your nose with it, which is inelegant.
A properly dressed and eaten Chicago style hot dog does not have to end with you needing a hand or face or shirt wash.

Bonus lecture: Why no ketchup? Because: 1) The tomato slices deliver the clear flavor of tomato which ketchup's heavy texture clouds. 2) The nuclear green relish provides a stronger hit of sweetness than ketchup. 3) The downside of ketchup is that it speeds the bun's descent into mushiness while masking flavors and adding unnecessary sweetness.

We can't do much during these miserable winter days, but we can make and eat a decent hot dog.

Final opinion = do what you want. It's your dog.

PS  Tell you friend to try an Italian beef.  Which has its own contents and eating style.  And is not a French Dip.

Yuri: I just had in mind the best nickname for that Swablu we caught. We should have called him *Swag*lu.

Me: I think I will actually need some caffeine, coke will not have that much of an effect on me.

Worldly dating is the process of finding a partner that is 'sexually compatible' with you, then when you find when you're compatible with, you move forward. Obviously, taking that path will lead to a relationship being built on sand. Courting, on the other hand, is when two Christians begin 'courting' with the intention to one day get married. If you have no intentions of wanting to get married soon, then my advice is to not try to pursue her romantically or you will likely ruin any sort of friendship. Holding hands, kissing, the title of bf/gf is not worth ruining a Godly friendship with the opposite sex. If she's the one for you, you'll know down the road. Last thing I'll say: To me, your post indicates the Holy Spirit is telling you not to pursue her romantically. I pray the Lord reveals His truth to you on this, God bless :-)","1422749643"

I think you are best off writing a script specific to your circumstance. Either to do the conversion or to clean up the website conversion.

Note that JUNOS allows terms and comments. Use these to carry forward the actual Cisco ACL lines onto the JUNOS config so you can demonstrate 1:1 translation.

Personally, I'd call out management's request for a direct migration and rip the ACL into fwbuilder and clean it up prior to the move (edit: that is, clean up the policy whilst still on IOS, then do a 1:1 move). In the long run this ACL shouldn't be managed by hand, so do have a look at fwbuilder.

At the very least with the move to JUNOS get some traceability of changes. eg, have a script to refuse commits which don't have comments starting with a issue ticket ID.","1422749650"

No, it was prerendered. It's always ""live"" footage of the game, yet the game never ends up looking as good as it does when it's first presented. 

The guide that enables ""E3"" graphics still isn't even close to E3 graphics. If you compare the particles, lighting, wind, and environmental effects, it's nowhere close. All the guide does is enable better shadows and shadows on certain objects that weren't previously shadowed.","1422749653"

And then, of course, there's also Hand Axes, which are generally considered the best weapon in the game. His Sword rank, especially if you promote him early, might not even be at A yet.

For the Cavs, yes, you'd need to put effort in. Duessel is the exception among the Cavs though. He starts with A axes, and is considered one of the best characters in the game on Ephraim's route.

It's like a combination of Letters from Whitechapel and A Touch of Evil (or similar games), only I feel it does it better at being than both games. Only downside is that it's very long (took 4 hours including teaching me). My game ended with me fighting Dracula, each with only 1 life point left. Came down to the last die roll...

**Alchemists:** Fun game, I love how the app works with it and the puzzle solving element of it. I can't wait to get my own copy though I worry after reading some reviews with the re-playability of it.

**Rococo:** Worker placement game about being 18th century dress makers. I enjoyed it and would play again but not in my Will Buy list.

**Cockroach Poker:** Little bluffing game I bought on a recommendation. It's hilariously fun and the art is adorable.

You might want to consider tanking or healing, imo. The game plays very differently. I couldn't find a dps spec I liked- I liked my hunter well enough to raid on her in SoO, but didn't want to keep maining it and couldn't find a replacement. I switched to healing on disc and then switched to holy spec, and it feels awesome. I feel like I'm contributing to the raid group a lot more than I did when I was on my hunter. 

I would really suggest tanking or healing at high levels, especially if you've tried both ranged and melee dps and neither has clicked for you. Otherwise maybe try a rogue/feral druid/monk class? They do play differently than both cloth casters and melee plate. ","1422749660"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Huh? Does Maliki allow opposition parties? Don't answer that.

He didn't. The US forced it. Maliki was a terribly brutal dictator, and he spent more effort on purging Sunnis than on actually fighting insurgents and their backers. Your ignorance strikes again. I disproved your other points, including your strawman with that book that was about an extremely different matter than how terrorism has exploded in Iraq once the US came in and overthrew everything and creating anarchy, hence creating the environment.

**Also, if anything you said regarding this had any basis, then Iraq would have become a peaceful place in 2003, not the most violent place in the world.** But of course, your point about this has zero foundation and in fact the preceding regimes kept the nation stable, kept the terrorists in their spider-holes, and built up Iraq to come to the top of the developing world by 1990. 

Then again, you talk well of Maliki who brought Iraq into complete ruin and made it one of the top 5 most corrupted countries in the world. Shows how much you know xD

&gt;Okay? What does this do at all to refute my point? US IS DEVIL! US IS DEVIL! Great, now that we got that out of our system and are in agreement there, what does that have to do with what I said?

Because I'm calling you out on your hypocrisy. The US had an overwhelming role in creating an environment to push people towards extremism, yet you're in completely denial of it.

&gt;No one said it did. What are you, his mom? Awfully defensive.

Nah, it's just that people like yourself are incredibly ignorant about anything to do with the Mideast, and it gets annoying really fast. People don't know a single thing about Iraq before 2003, and even what they do know since 2003 is extremely limited and misconstrued. 

&gt;Again: Okay? What does this do at all to refute my point? US IS DEVIL! US IS DEVIL! Great, now that we got that out of our system and are in agreement there, what does that have to do with what I said?

I made the point that terrorism in Iraq wasn't a big issue before 2003. You said that book is proof of the opposite. But that book has nothing to do with that matter at all. Instead, it has to do with how the US should approach Mideastern policy, and it should do so diplomatically rather than committing all sorts of barbarisms and destruction. If anything, the book proves my point that the US has been a prime catalyst in developing an environment for extremism to prosper, as I've also mentioned in previous posts.","1422749661"

However, thats beside the point. Even if he sees a doctor, a persons nature does not change on a dime. Its a long process. 

Your best bet, imo, is not to ""fix"" him, but to alleviate your mom's burden. 

To that end, the best approach I can think right now is to give her the financial wherewithal so she can stand by herself. Financial and social wherewithal. So that she does not have to depend on him.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","I think what OP's getting it, is that it seems that a pretty good amount of the /r/atheism posts that filter into /r/all are more anti-religion than anything. 

It's a little off right now because quite a few of the ""top of all time"" posts are regarding Charlie Hebdo, but if you take out those covering that one event, you'll see a lot of the top all all time are things like:

-Muslims look at a lot of porn

Jews delay plane for religious beliefs

Jewish paper crops out women from photo

-Cartoon poking at hypocrisy of war compared to gods' peace-loving attributes.

-The costs of megachurches


I mean, take this with a grain of salt because I don't frequent /r/atheism and aren't aware of what's normally posted there. And that's also not to say that any above topics are insensitive or offensive in particular, or aren't worth talking about. I think it just looks like, based on what hits /r/all, that /r/atheism looks more like anti-religion than atheist and OP is asking why that would be default.

Before anyone says ""well atheism kind of is anti-religion"", I'm talking about the posts in particular. You don't go to /r/Christianity or whatever and see a lot of posts about how Islamic or Atheist beliefs are ruining this or that.","1422749671"

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","**(I should probably state very specifically and loudly when I'm playing Devil's Advocate.)**

While in general I agree, I want to point out that Florida, in particular, may have vagrancy issues related to its climate, resources, and tourism economy. Or at least that's the perception of its inhabitants. 

After all, it's one of the few places in the continental US that a person can be in little danger of dying from cold weather, year round. Lots of places have unguarded fruit trees. Canals, lakes, and rivers are fish-able with hand lines that cost only a couple of dollars to put together. Same with the surf if you're on a coast. Then, of course, snow-birds and tourists can be both extremely wasteful and generous. If I were going to be homeless, Florida sounds like a good place to do it.

So if you live in South Florida and feel like homeless are streaming in from further north, do you feel like it's fair to pay for local safety nets that serve several states' worth of homeless?

Or if you live in some state further north, are you going to pay to take care of the homeless from your state that end up in Florida? (And is that even a plausible proposal? I doubt it.)

South Florida took quite a hit from the recession, too. The rural areas, in particular, aren't rich.

I'm not saying there are no answers, or that all of the things I said above are necessarily true, as opposed to a public perception. I'm just saying that it's a complicated issue. In light of those things it probably seems pretty just for a South Floridian to not wish to pay the bill. And one (yes, heartless) way to avoid that is to make the area less hospitable to homeless people.","1422749671"

"GamerGhazi","t5_33oia","Can I just put in: I don't have a Reddit account, nor do I want one.  Occasionally I generate burners, like this one, in order to drop in a brief comment:

I lurk all three gg hubs (8chan, KiA, &amp; here).  Not once, EVER, have I seen a single thread on 8chan which was 
a.) clearly a Ghazi, dropping in
b.) trying to claim or prove that 'GG is all just harassment.'

What would be the point of such a thread?  Who honestly believes any 'channer is swayable (new word!) enough for such a thread to accomplish anything?  

Personally, I'd hope I'm much more effective with my actual activities on 8chan, which primarily consists of decrying random posts with ""shills!"" and ""hi 'Ghazi!""  That and encouraging the poor saps to waste their time and effort in harmless endeavors instead of active harassment.  I'm particularly proud of the sea lion.  

As the movement has died down, not even channers believe the false reports of ""happenings"" any more.  It's grown sadly moribund over there.

"Documentaries","t5_2qhlh","I was browsing some brothels websites in Nevada, one had only Asian girls, the other had Russian girls. All immigrants. I would have had to drive to another city to pay for an American girl. Outside of Vegas, cities in Nevada are hundreds of kilometers away from each other.

Had a similar experience in Brussels. All the girls in the red light district were from eastern Europe. Had to try my luck in a bar in order to bang a Dutch girl. ","1422749673"

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt;- Maybe you could do a mini contest between the final 8 or 16 members of this contest and the Best Girl contest, so we can all figure out the real champion of /r/anime!

Actually, I wanted to create a new contest that is similar to that except it will be a bit different.  I just debating what I should call it.  The Best of /r/anime Contest, /r/anime Popularity Contest, or The No Restriction Contest.  However, I am also debating if I should do it or not.","1422749674"

So medications for depression and anxiety, understanding suicide, figuring out what makes people happier and more productive, knowing why some relationships enrich lives and others lead to spite and violence, enabling children to learn more effectively, etc., all of that is inconsequential? What the fuck do you consider to be important then?","1422749674"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","The presenter doesn't provide his audience with enough information to understand what these people are talking about or why they believe what they believe.  For example, the host of the show where the gentleman mentioned the Muslim no go zones refuted his statement on air and apologized for any insensitivity.  The gentleman who made that statement was referencing events that happened in the immigrant burroughs of Paris in 2005 during a long series of riots.  

The idea is just to make other people look like mentally inferior jerks who are motivated by irrational fears and hatreds so you don't have to consider their perspective, have empathy for them and can instead feel good about being so much better than everyone else.  This show isn't about spreading information, it's about persuasion by withholding information - just twisted humor from a cynical asshole, probably best not to take it seriously or let it influence your worldview.","1422749675"

Grom with taskmaster is 12 for 10.

Fon/SR is 14 for 9.
