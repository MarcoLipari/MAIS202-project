"PMDD","t5_2tokr","You don‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt) need to be in a crisis to deserve to take action toward maybe feeling a bit better than you do right now. But I hear you - it makes sense to me that it feels extra risky to take that step when you‚Äôre not even certain that the provider you see will believe you. 

To answer one of the questions you asked:
I always knew that I had painful periods, but I didn‚Äôt associate the drastic increase in depression and anxiety symptoms I felt every month with my period until a therapist I had when I was 16 pointed it out to me. I brought my symptoms to my pediatrician at the time: she was the one who formally diagnosed me. At first, she prescribed me continuous use birth control (birth control, but you skip the week of sugar pills and start a new pack/ring/patch/whatever immediately). This made a massive difference on its own (happy to tell you more about how it works) - she prescribed an antidepressant on top because I was still having mood swings, and that was helpful too. 

Other thoughts: In your case - if you‚Äôre seeing a provider and you‚Äôre not confident they know what PMDD is, you could consider bringing up your depression/anxiety symptoms separately from any other cycle-related pain you may experience. If you‚Äôre hoping for medication, doctors are pretty quick to prescribe SSRI antidepressants (first-line for PMDD) for straight up depression/anxiety. 

Given that you haven‚Äôt been to a doctor in a while, I don‚Äôt know if seeing a startup telehealth provider would be the best option for you. The quality of the provider on these kinds of sites (especially the smaller, less well-known ones) can be pretty significantly variable. (If you‚Äôre committed to telehealth, I‚Äôve had a decent experience with Teladoc.)

In case you haven‚Äôt already come across this - I found this map of federally supported community health centers. Health centers like the ones listed here are likely to frequently work with patients who are un- or underinsured to help them access care: https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov. Is there a location near you?

Getting bloodwork done can be helpful, but it isn‚Äôt necessarily necessary. There are very likely medications that a doctor would be willing to prescribe without having bloodwork done. If I had to choose what to spend my healthcare dollars on, I would definitely prioritize a safe medicine over bloodwork. 

Apologies for the infodump if any of this isn‚Äôt helpful! And feel free to PM me if you‚Äôd like to practice roleplaying what the conversation might look like or to workshop how you want to explain what‚Äôs been going on. üíïüíïüíïüíï",1656633600

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think term limits should be removed because they hinder a president's ability to enact their policies. A two-term limit means that a president has to accomplish everything they want to do in eight years, which is often not enough time. Additionally, presidents are often more effective in their second term because they have gained experience and knowledge about how the government works. Also if a president is not doing well they can be voted out of office before the usual 4 years is up.",1656633600

I don't know if other ones are better but I find the one that comes with my star tracker to be impossible to use because I can never see the stars I need. It's made harder by the fact that in the southern hemisphere there is no bright star next to the celestial pole like northern hemisphere people get.

[Carmack &amp; Milos, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5349724/)

The primary author of this review is a board-certified urologist.

Maintaining foreskin hygiene is easier than brushing your teeth. Male bodies are not inherently any dirtier than female bodies. The ideas in favor of male genital mutilation of children are absurd outdated myths, and more and more people are waking up to them and are going to call them out.

If a person is capable of cleaning their teeth, anus, and other body parts, they are more than capable of cleaning their foreskins.

Relying on circumcision as protection from STDs is absurd; circumcision is not effective protection, condoms must be worn regardless if having sex with a partner who may have an STD. Or you could simply choose to be abstinent or monogamous.

The fact is these possible ""health benefits"", which can be achieved to a far superior degree through other, less invasive means like condoms and basic hygiene, are post-hoc rationalizations for a cultural practice. I've spoken with many Filipino men who regret having been cut but were manipulated into it at a vulnerable time in life and didn't have access to all the relevant information.

This insanity has got to end. You are not doing anything good; you are injuring children.",1656633601

2. \[&lt;\] component ---&gt; \[OR\] component ---&gt; \[Relay\] component
3. \[Relay\] component ---&gt; O2 generator

The greater than component is the trigger, the memory component is the set-point. If it reads a value at or under the set-point, the greater than will output a signal to the OR component, which then tells the relay to power up. Once powered, the oxygen generator activates. 

Once the oxygen levels go above the set-point, the greater than component stops sending a signal altogether (no false output). The OR component reads no signal, and after a two-second delay, sends a false output to turn off the relay, powering the whole system down. 

This can be scaled up to a max of ten greater than components (aka ten rooms) per OR component, and 5 OR components per relay. 50 rooms, total, more than you'll probably ever need. Probably.

Hi /u/blondehurricanexxx!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

`A.  You are actually the MILF in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the MILF's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

* New and low karma accounts cannot be verified. If you've only been on reddit for a short time, have low karma, and/or you haven't done much NSFW self-posting on reddit, you'll be asked to build up your posting history for a month or so before verifying here. Posting nudes isn't for everyone, and we want you to ""get your feet wet"" by posting in some smaller subs before you jump into the deep end of the pool.

Show as much of your body as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to show your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

-The /r/MILF Mod Team

"Georgia","t5_2ql6n","Hi there fellow politics and geography nerd. Ya, I was just working off the assumption that the new GA 6th along with the 11th are not competitive and won't be later in the decade either. I don't think OP wants to wait for just the potential for a competitive US House race in 2028 or 2030. According to the Princeton metric it is a D 41% R 59% with the 11th only being 1% more competitive. So I just disregarded the US House districts with my overlays and just did regions were the GA House overlapped with the GA Senate competitively. The only 2 spots being the south part of Johns Creek and the southwest part of Sugar Hill. I used that US House non-competitiveness assumption because the 2016 to 2020 elections were really an outlier in terms of vote swing, and I don't think that trend is going to continue, but most likely regress. The voters made such a huge swing that I don't think there is much more room to grow. This massive swing was from negative partisanship and extreme hatred of Trump. Negative partisanship (how much you hate the opposing party) is the most compelling reason people vote. People vote nowadays to keep the other party out of power more than vote to put your preferred party into power. And additionally, even though a high percentage of people call themselves independents, in reality, the vast majority are just lying to you. Its just more negative partisanship. They don't identify with a party so they claim independent, but year after year they vote for the same party anyway in order to keep the party they don't like out of power. Swing voters don't really exist anymore, so I think that D 41% to R 59% number is pretty maxed out.",1656633604

"HorrorGaming","t5_2w4bb","Sounds like you‚Äôre a survival horror guy! Unfortunately for folks like us, there honestly isn‚Äôt a *ton* in recent years (especially on modern consoles) that fills the traditional survival horror vibe besides Resi 7, REMakes 1 and 2, and Resi 8 to a lesser extent. But there are a few games here and there I‚Äôd recommend‚Äî just note that most of them aren‚Äôt first person, if that bothers you. 

Puppet Combo games always deserve a massive shoutout here. On PS4/5, we have Murder House and Nun Massacre. Murder House is more aligned with traditional survival horror gameplay, but both are great. 

Tormented Souls is one of the coolest survival horror games I‚Äôve played in a long time. Very very traditional Resi style gameplay, absolutely awesome game, highly recommend it. There‚Äôs also a couple other similar traditional survival horror games like Song of Horror. The Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water remaster that recently came out is pretty solid too, but admittedly that‚Äôs one of the weaker games in the series. 

I also sort of recommend Evil Within 2. I love that game, but it‚Äôs not *quite* Resident Evil. It‚Äôs closer to it than lots of other modern horror games though, so maybe check that out at some point.  Evil Within 1 is a pretty good game too, but it‚Äôs more just a Resi 4 style action horror situation. 

If you‚Äôre willing to go back in time to some old games, however, there‚Äôs a practically endless stream of Resident Evil clones that are super worth playing. Silent Hill 1-3 should probably be at the top of that list. PS1/2 games can be pretty easily emulated on PC and current gen Xbox.",1656633604

If you scroll through that sub you'll see my hope posts average 4x the upvotes of the usual ""hot posts"" of the day. In war subs, people want to see war things. And dead bodies usually mean winning to most people and it fuels their fervor. For some it's morbid curiosity, Like rubber nicking at a freeway accident; others are filling a need. Either way, your opinion isn't NOT valid, it just has no place on this sub, Like maybe you dont either. 

I'm gonna point out to you that this post is marked NSFW and the images are blurred out until you click on them. You literally read the title, clicked on the post and then had to click on the images and scroll through them to see them before you started complaining.

Because when the President publicly states his policy prescription, it's a signal to the public - i.e. me, and you, and all the relevant constituents - to put pressure on those lawmakers, to call them, to write to them, to visit their offices even, and make them know that there is a motivated sizable number of people who demand they take action. 

My point is that ultimately we're responsible for the politics we have. If we keep pointing fingers outward from ourselves and absolving ourselves of our civic responsibility, we get the milquetoast presidency we see here.

This makes them a pretty risky breed currently because there are many breeders breeding APBT, American bulldog, staffordshire, bull terrier, and other game instinct dogs into them. American bulldog is a common cross in a lot of XL or ‚Äòextreme‚Äô build lines. What makes American bullies even more risky, is that if someone says theirs made a great family dog there is a very good possibility that it is *true*. Because they‚Äôre such a grab-bag of different dog breeds, you literally have a 50/50 chance of getting a normal dog, or a dog that‚Äôs going to have extreme prey drive that will turn on humans if not sated.

saying that a traditional database can be modified to work on a distributed consensus model in the same manner as blockchain, without sharing the core features of blockchain, is a really silly thing to say. the only reason someone would say this is if they didn't actually understand the technologies they're talking about. i'm trying to be open-minded here, so if you do actually have some incredible algorithm hidden up your sleeve then now is the time to reveal it. but if your next response is another half-baked assertion without proof, or another attempt to catch me saying something incorrect so that you can yell ""aha! i win"", then i'm just going to ignore it and move on.

I (21M) got out of a relationship a couple months ago and decided to start seeing people casually. I met this girl (20F) on bumble we can call her Nancy. Nancy and I started to chat and really hit it off. We were both really clear with one another about the nature of our relationship and decided to just enjoy being with one another hanging out and maybe getting frisky if necessary. I chatted with her for about a month and we had lots of genuine fun with each other.

Nancy introduced me to her friend group, but in particular Josh (19M) We all got along just fine. about a month into our fling she texted me that she wants to stop because she was getting serious with Josh and wanted me to respect her new bf. I was understanding, albeit bummed, but the conversation was very civil and we remained friends after since we just genuinely enjoyed each others company. I was still invited to outings and hung out with her friend group and her with mine. After our conversation it was a bit awkward at first but we eventually got used to being friendly 24/7. honestly shes really understanding and down to earth. a great person and friend.

Now here's the problem. She started dating Josh after our fling ended officially, but she was seeing both of us and one more guy as no one was official. That all stopped when she got with josh ofc. a couple days ago I was out with her friend group, she wasn't there, and me and the boys were drinking. One of them brought up the fact that josh was lucky to steal her from me because shes a great person (obviously lightly jabbing at him as guys do) he looked really concerned and turned to me to ask if I had ever been with her before.

I answered yes and told him we were casually seeing each other for about a month before we stopped. I honestly wasn't thinking about it and just answered truthfully. he then asked if we have had sex before and I questioned why that mattered as she was with him now. He said its his girlfriend and he needs to know. I said yes a few times but tried to highlight that we really hung out more than had sex. He honestly looked horrified and excused himself before disappearing for the night. I didn't really think much of it and kept drinking. 

Nancy texted me the next day pissed off that I told him and I didn't have to say we had sex. I told her I answered honestly and I didn't mean to cause any problems between them. Apparently he didn't know we had gotten physical and just thought I was someone she was seeing but she lost interest in. now he's not showing up to anything if Im there and the friend group is split. Some say it wasn't that big of a deal and that he asked and insisted, others say I could've just lied and said no. Which honestly felt unnecessary at the moment. 

I feel bad for him since it must be weird for us all to be friends now. AITA?

Predatory behavior should never be accepted in any relationship, even of its casual sex. Calling all couples looking for a female third predatory is way over the top.

"AMD_Stock","t5_3fr05","Micron Technology stock is trading lower after the memory-chip maker said financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter ending in August will come in well short of previous Street estimates.

While analysts had expected a soft forecast, investors may be surprised by the severity of the miss, which suggests a sharp slowdown in consumer tech-hardware spending that could have ramifications for other chip companies.

Micron saw particular weakness in demand from China. Micron chief business officer Sumit Sadana said in an interview that the company‚Äôs revised guidance reflects a 30% reduction in the company‚Äôs revenue expectations from China from what it had expected just one quarter ago. That change, he says, represents about a 10% reduction in overall revenue expectations for the quarter.

In late trading, Micron stock is down 3%, at $53.75.

For the fiscal third quarter ended June 2, Micron (ticker: MU ) posted revenue of $8.64 billion, about in line with the company‚Äôs forecast for $8.7 billion, give or take $200 million. Non-GAAP profits of $2.59 a share were a little ahead of the company‚Äôs forecast of $2.46 a share, give or take a dime. Non-GAAP gross margin was 47.4%, within the guidance range of 47% to 49%. Wall Street consensus estimates had called for $8.63 billion in revenue and adjusted profits of $2.44 a share.",1656633607

On one hand he never finished higher than 11th in points (missed the playoffs a couple of years he probably should have been in) yet won at Daytona, Talladega, Indy and Charlotte. Sort of like a modern version of Sterling Marlin who mainly won at plate tracks along with wins at legacy tracks Charlotte and Darlington and also Vegas and Michigan. They both have 2 crown jewel wins, similar plate race win records (5 vs 4), and wins at Charlotte.

I feel like Vickers could have been at that level and would have had he not had his health issues but I wouldn't put him quite at McMurray territory either simply because of prestigious events JMac actually won. Brian's first few Toyota years were rough also so those were some lost season's for him that didn't help.",1656633607

Interesting, not sure if I believe some of this but if they want to sprinkle in F4 characters I think the Thing is a good place to start. He‚Äôs the most noticeable at a first glance (unless Johnny is on fire but still). I also think he‚Äôs a favorite amongst kids but I could be wrong. 

What ever the excuse for the transformations MCU can always say ‚Äúthey were in a lab trying to fix the changes‚Äù to explain why they didn‚Äôt show up for other catastrophic events. Like Spider-Man they don‚Äôt need to do the whole back story over again, it can always be brought up in conversation or as a flashback. 

Still it feels odd to me that the first time we see the thing, already transformed, and comfortable enough to be in a court room (not that he would have a choice if subpoena‚Äôd) I could see a Defamation case against a company that he accused caused the transformation but then why not the rest of the group?

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"370z","t5_2uqfc","Cheapest option with good results is to build your own.   Rough list of parts:  10AN radiator ($50-$100 depending on how big, recommend going as big as you can to make it worthwhile), about 12 ft 10AN hose (recommend PTFE, ~$60), 4x 10AN 90 degree fittings (~$30, look for PTFE specific ones if you go with PTFE hose),  thermostatic sandwich plate plus 2x 10AN fittings to whatever ORB size the plate uses (~$50-$150, price ranges but I would spend at least $50 on one with good reviews).



If you have one of the later Z models with the OEM oil cooler I highly recommend removing it.   Doing that further dropped my temps by another 10 degrees and frees up space so I can use full size oil filters again.  Also you can remove the metal coolant lines for it and route your new lines through the drivers side, much neater/easier IMO and no chance of the sway bar hitting your fittings.   You'll need a 09-13 oil filter stud (Nissan Part #15213-31U00) and two 1/2"" reinforced silicone bypass caps for the coolant lines.  I think HPS sells them for an exorbitant $15 each but worth the peace of mind.

These people may be extremists, but they are not a ""extreme wing of the Republican party"".  They are not outliers.  Just one single Republican voted against one of their confirmations.  And only because her vote didn't matter.

This narrative is false.  It is cover.  This isn't ""Trump's fault"".  Its not a takeover.  It's what they told their voters they would do.

The Republican party did this.  The Republican party has openly said for many years that they were going to do this.  And they collectively all worked together at every level of government to make all of these things happen.

All of these Republican controlled state legislatures all of a sudden magically knew to create illegal laws that Republican governor's knew to invest tax money into defending in court.  All in the same year.  Almost like they all suddenly *knew* they had the court.

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","there are certain areas of the Netherlands which have shrinking population and many vacant homes (krimpgebieden - shrinking areas). Then there are other areas which are anticipated to have a shrinking population in the near future (anticipeergebieden). In these areas, easy to buy a house, and social housing has no waitlist (compared to 5-10 years in high demand areas). These regions are officially classified by the government.

In some areas like Delfzijl where absolutely nobody wants to live, it's easy to find a nice home for under ‚Ç¨200k. Either an unrenovated terrace home or modern flat, for that budget. Like I said, super cheap area. But FYI even in those areas you still need to bid over asking price, usually ‚Ç¨30k-50k is standard if you really want to get the house

As an example, at my last job I was typically getting a very early start to the day, had an uncertain access to lunch, and would be doing manual labor for most of the day.  So, eating a heavy breakfast at around 6 AM was critical to make sure I had what I needed to make it through the day.

I can't explain it, it just stopped working for a cool minute. Restarted the PC and it was dead, I thought it bricked itself somehow.

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

&gt;Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

&gt;‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

&gt;Ôº∏ What does this mean?

&gt;‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

&gt;Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

&gt;‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

Edit: this does not usually apply to cars if it's a larger set, or if you live in an area where your garage is blocked by setups or equipment, which is much of the set area.

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you may be violating PP ToS.

No issue.  After renunciation, you can apply for a POC.  A POC card will allow you to buy/own property, use bank accounts, and work.  Just can't vote or do other citizen-specific things (civil service, etc).


&gt;Pakistani citizenship for future children

Depends:

If you are male, then your children under 21 will lose Pakistani citizenship when your renunciation is complete.  They will have the option of reacquiring it at the age of 21 though.  They can get a POC card so the impact is limited.  

If you are female, the renunciation only applies to you, not your children (they can retain Pakistani citizenship).

If they change the laws later (for example, Norway recently started to allow dual citizenship), there may be other ways for your children to acquire Pakistani citizenship without losing their other citizenship.",1656633613

Well, it depends on what you mean by ""run with them"".  If you mean that he won't go find some other girl, and have sex with her, then I think it's very reasonable for you to ask for that.

Alternatively, if you expect a young man that's not having sex to also not masturbate than you're asking for too much.  That stuff has to come out one way or the other, like poop does.  That's why I compare them so often.

Have you ever met someone obsessed with pooping, who thinks about it all the time?  I haven't, and I doubt you have.   You know why?  Because people poop when they have to, and it's a complete non-issue.

Do you know how to get someone to obsess about pooping?  Do you know how to get someone so they they can think about NOTHING else other than pooping, and they maybe even consider killing themselves?  That's right, tell them that pooping is wrong and they should do it as little as possible, preferably not at all.

That's how you drive someone nuts.  That's how you make someone think about something ALL the time.  That's how you create people that want to die (because they loath themselves) and hate God.  Tell them that God wants them to not do something they literally have no choice about doing.",1656633613

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","No, as I said, pregnancy is a protected class like sex, gender, religion, race, etc. It‚Äôs not a protected class for ‚Äútheir body their choice.‚Äù If I recall correctly, part of the justification for making pregnancy a protected class was that it‚Äôs a branch of sexism. Only people with uteruses would ever face this kind of discrimination in the first place, so discriminating based on abortion ‚Äústatus‚Äù is tantamount to discriminating against (primarily) women. 

Putting that aside for a second, though, I don‚Äôt think that vaccination status is on the same level as pregnancy.

1. Anybody can be unvaccinated. It‚Äôs not as though discriminating against unvaccinated people is discriminating pretty much exclusively against men, or blacks people, or Christians, etc. 

2. There are unobtrusive alternatives which make being unvaccinated pretty easy. You can claim exemption, you can homeschool your kids, you can watch Netflix at home instead of at the theater, you can order your groceries delivered, you can opt to get tested weekly, etc. The only time I‚Äôve ever seen it be ‚Äúvaccinate or lose your job‚Äù has been where you pose a substantial risk of spreading disease to the immunocompromised. There‚Äôs no other option for pregnancy. You either abort, or give birth. 

3. Pregnancy is not contagious. It solely affects the person who is pregnant. A pregnant person can‚Äôt spread their pregnancy to people around them. A deadly virus absolutely can, which is why vaccine mandates are necessary in the first place. They‚Äôre a matter of public health.",1656633614

Its mostly fetch quest or walking to an NPC so you get a cutscene. Sometimes the story between the fetch quest is good I have to give them that and the instance quests are sometimes good.

There is truth in your statement about people are anti-abortion until they or a loved one gets pregnant. Because I was once there. 

Many things made me re-evaluate the belief I grew up with, the main catalyst being on a mission trip I was researching the country and read about the consequences of abortion being illegal there. I realized regardless of how I felt in abortion I wanted to live in a country where it is legal. 

I've further come to see how the need for legal and safe abortion access is important and how there are so many factors it's too difficult to anticipate all the scenarios and make complicated and detailed laws.

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","&gt;When you portray killers asking for DeadHard nerfs as Crybabies going ""REEEEEEE-"" it's kinda hard NOT to think it's gotten you a little pissy.

Right, killers complain non-stop about a perk that's actually not that big of a deal but I'm the crybaby, got it.

&gt;So in short, you're using the ""you just suck at the game"" Argument here.

Yes because if you actually make an effort to play around Dead Hard you will find it's not that big of a problem. Instead you asked for a change, which you got, and I doubt you will actually end up liking it as it seems even more busted than before.

&gt;We DO play around it. It's still an annoying mess of a perk. Nobody wants a Good mindgame spoiled by fucking hitting E.

You really don't because if you did you wouldn't be complaining that hard. But even if I take this statement at face value, maybe then stop expecting a hit just for ""winning"" a mindgame which isn't that impressive of a thing. Which BTW the new Dead Hard does this exact same thing so how you can make this complaint but then say you're fine with what it changed to seems contradictory.

&gt;And THAT is the fucking problem. You just admitted it right there.

Yea and there's also a million cases where I'm killer and, usually due to my power or a perk, the survivor is put in a lose-lose situation too. Yet killer mains will sit here and say it takes skill to hit someone through a wall with Pyramid Head's quake attack even though it's the EXACT same thing where there is nothing the survivor can do. I guess it's only a problem if survivors do it though?

There are also scenarios with other perks where it's unwinnable for the killer. Hop into a locker with DS there isn't anything they can do. Bodyblock a hook near and exit gate with Breakout, there is nothing they can do unless the came prepared with Agi/Starstruck or something. I don't get why all those scenarios are ok, no one complains about them, but Dead Hard is such a huge problem. Sure it's used more, but like I keep saying if you actually address the core issue of map/tile design that could be fixed without changing the perk in any way, AND it would have a much more meaningful and positive impact on the game overall.

I've seen both Das and Whale and I even commented on their videos. Oh wow, look some popular content creator hates Dead Hard too. That validates your opinion, if you say so LOL. Whale makes good points but at the same time when you watch the video at least HALF of the clips he could have played better and got them. A lot of them are him just whiffing, which is what Dead Hard is designed to do it wasn't even for distance. All the content creators think the same, it's an echo chamber, on top of the fact that they will jump on any popular topic for clicks. I'd take their opinions with a grain of salt.

Dead Hard isn't the problem, it's a symptom of the problem, and the problem is map/tile design. What they did to Dead Hard is not going to fix anything, it looks like it's just going to make complaints worse since half of them are about the fact that a survivor can press a button to dodge a hit ***which is exactly what the perk is supposed to do***. So no I don't feel sympathy for killer mains because it's obvious they just don't want to get better or use their brain when the play. The agenda for most if very clear, then they jump on this ""for distance"" bandwagon too because why not if they already just hate the perk for what it is?",1656633615

I highly recommend you find a new terminology for the word 'staking' as there is no such thing as staking on Stellar or a way to stake Stellar tokens using the Stellar blockchain. Not only is it misleading, it confuses newcomers who may not have fully understood the Stellar blockchain.

Plus we have a domestic supply shortage of infants, a government corrupted by the wealthy and Supreme Court judges who were unfairly appointed because Republicans hijacked the process and Democrats are inefficient and feckless. So of course the majority of Americans, who approve of allowing a woman to have control over body and life, will now have to deal with the death thralls of the crazy Christian right-wing who wants to make abortion illegal on a federal level, demonize any LGBTQ person until they're too scared to be in the open, deny people birth control, and widdle away first amendment rights.

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

Finally, please make sure you read the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

If you were right, then every building built would have a lot of parking. But when you remove parking requirements - the actual number of spots tumbles down.  Highly recommend this book to learn more: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_High\_Cost\_of\_Free\_Parking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Cost_of_Free_Parking)

It's because parking is actually not that necessary. Lots of people live like I do e.g. no car. And most people are willing to just car-share/take transit rather than pay the enormous amount of money to have a personal parking spot.

LA's laws are actively going to be changed. I've been helping canvas for some initiatives to change it. But safe to say: this building is going to destroy the climate because LA city council wants it to.",1656633619

"MadeMeSmile","t5_2uqcm","I know a triplet that is a model, there's two girls that look identical, and their brother looks exactly like them but obviously a guy.

So did they have one pair of identical twins and a well then I'm confused.

I guess I could Google them, but they're famous and their brother isn't, so I doubt there's a lot of info on it.

But there's definitely 3 of them, the two girls look identical for sure, and the guy looks damn close but has short hair and a goatee so looks different due to that but he looks pretty close.

I guess my question is, how they there be three identical triplets where one is a male. Are they just triplets that look a lot alike? Seems unlikely when I look at the girls, it's impossible to tell which is which.

**Edit:** Did some research, and they're the Herbert twins if you want to take a look, but they are triplets, they just promote themselves as twins because it gets them more social media exposure being two hot girls.

Their brother was definitely born with them, and looks exactly like them, here's what I found.

""It is not uncommon for triplets to be dizygotic, which occurs when two separate eggs are each fertilized, and one of the fertilized eggs then splits into two. Essentially, two of the triplets are monozygotic (identical) twins, sharing the same general DNA characteristics, while the third triplet having been conceived with a different egg and sperm has a unique genetic makeup from the other two.""",1656633619

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Let me tell you about an interesting compliment I received last night.

So I met someone on Tinder a couple weeks ago and she is absolutely a wonderful person.  A little shorter than me, curvy, with the brightest hair and prettiest makeup you've ever seen.  We have met twice so far.  But unlike most people I talk to on dating apps, the topic of sex didn't come up at all...until last night.  Not that we weren't attracted to each other by any means, it's just that we decided to take things slow and steady - and so far it's going well!  We haven't even exchanged nudes or anything - the most she has seen of me is a shirtless pic or two, and the most I have seen of her is a bit of cleavage and her stomach (more on that later).

Let me preface this by saying that I always want my partner to be comfortable with what I'm doing.  Often I can sense if they aren't vibing with something, but I always ask just to be sure.  Whenever I get intimate with someone I'll always ask if they are comfortable or if they want me to go farther or touch somewhere else, and most women seem to appreciate that.

We were chillin' at her apartment on her sectional last night.  Somehow the topic of spooning came up, and she asked ""Do you wanna try?""  Of course, I said yes, and assumed the Big Spoon position.  I joked that I was in a better position to kiss the back of her neck, and proceeded to do so.  Then I went around to her cheeks, neck, and forehead after she communicated that she loved it.

Since my hands were already on her stomach as part of the spooning dealio, I asked if I could lift up her shirt a bit and rub her stomach.  She gave me an enthusiastic ""yes"".  After just kinda stroking her tummy for a while, I decided to try something I'd heard about and started hovering my fingertips above her skin, gently tracing them around both her stomach and her sides.  She LOVED this.  She was getting a little squirmy and ticklish which I found super hot (right before this, she confessed that she got ticklish when she was in a ""certain mood"").  

But she wasn't done yet.  She figured that since I made her squirm, it was her turn.  She found my ticklish spots fairly easily.  Of course I had to restrain her and grabbed her by the wrists to stop her vicious assault.  Then I called her a brat (because she is!).  She didn't deny it, but said something interesting: ""How did you know?""  I explained that it was obvious from how she was messing with me.  Honestly I half-meant it as a teasing little insult and half-meant it as a kinky type deal.  It meant both things.

Now here's what I found the most interesting.  After all that went down, we were chatting about how we were teasing each other and whether or not everything had felt comfortable.

And she just goes ahead and says ""I think you'd make a good Daddy.""

~~And then we fucked the end~~ My ears perked up at that and I asked her to explain.  She said that in terms of the aftercare and making someone feel comfortable, it was a natural fit.  Obviously that opens up a huge possibility for a relationship, but more than that I take it as a huge compliment.  At least to me it implies trust, skill in caring for others, and helping someone explore their passions while nurturing them too.  I hadn't ever really considered myself as a fit for that kind of role, but hey, if she thinks so then I'm willing to give it a shot.",1656633620

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;Yeah, the point to rigging an election is to ensure that the person that you rig it for gets the most votes.

Absolutely. You've hit the nail on the head there. But there's another very important part to rigging an election, and stay with me here, because this is complex - you have to *actually do something which in some way affects the election*. 

Some person or persons have to take some concrete action which in some way, *any* way, materially affects the chances of someone. Without that, it's just a bunch of people saying it's rigged because they didn't like the outcome. And if that kinda rings a bell, again, it's because that's what Trump's been doing since November 2020.

Both sides having fundraising agreements doesn't affect the election. Wasserman-Schultz calling Weaver a liar in a private email doesn't affect the election. Therefore, these things are not ""rigging"" the election.

I'd also point out that I mentioned that he did not get more votes in 2020 as well - may we then assume from your response that you're saying it was also rigged in 2020?",1656633620

When I brought it up to my insurance company they said I needed a note from the state dept. that patrolled and cleaned that road proving i hit a foreign object.  The dept had no record of cleaning anything from the road that night so I had no proof that the damage was not my fault.  So I was stuck footing the $3k repair bill.

Bacterial and mold contamination in almost everything.  I am not trying to be a Debbie downer, but even your jars that you said colonized perfectly look contaminated. Generally the grains shouldn't stick to the glass. 

Start from the beginning, get your sterile tek down. Are you working sterile, still air box, PCing etc? Alcohol or bleaching your SAB and tools, flame sterilizing your metal tools etc... being clean and sterile is EVERYTHING. If you don't have clean agar and grain, you are just wasting time and energy. 

Your setup will work great for gourmets (once you get the sterilization down) But cubes do better in a tub, no need for them to be in the tent. I like modified monotubs or modified dubtubs. If you get everything dialed in, you can set and forget them until you are ready to harvest. No misting or fanning unless it absolutely needs it (but you should get it dialed in so you don't have to).

Those people don't matter to the film's bottom line at all. Blaming the groundskeeper or the mailman for hypothetical lost interest or millions is silly as hell. I've *already* addressed that upthread. It's such a ridiculous premise to attempt using as justification for something that is, so obviously, on the face of it, ridiculous as fuck. 

The knee-jerk desire to reframe the scenario so that the corporation indulging their paranoid, thoughtless corporate horseshit is SMART, ACTUALLY doesn't hold any weight, for me. I don't see any reason to go along with that.

I think my biggest problem is if I do upgrade, I really want to take a step up, which puts me in the $500-$700 range (as opposed to the original $190 that I paid for the ender 3 in 2019), and is just a pretty big commitment (even though I've already proven to myself that I'll use it!).  That Kickstarter for the AnkerMake M5 was really tempting and I really should have pulled the trigger on the early bird special at $429, but $599 feels like a lot.

"battles2","t5_4390db","Layering generally doesn't do too much against bomb tbh, though a lot of lower HoM players often die to fmoab insides if you play r18 right. 30 health fcerams aren't easy for 2 clusters to handle, and if they do defend, it's often with an overdefend that costs several thousand dollars.

Tack farm ice shouldn't have an issue with moabs/fmoabs, and a bfb should warrant buying a couple overdrives under embrittlement and a mael.

"NFLNoobs","t5_326ue","Rural and Suburban America (all those spaces between big cities) is overwhelmingly Christian.  There are thousands and thousands of high school teams in all these areas where the vast majority or their entire programs are practicing Christians.  It's just extremely prevalent in this sport.  

A lot of people don't want to acknowledge it, but most ""football"" sports have a very Christian-heavy origin that has a lot to do with this phenomenon.  All the footballs: Soccer, rugby, American Football, etc...these are all sports that were created and cultivated in school systems in England and the USA, which were also Christian schools, where religion was a focal point of education.  If you look at the origins of all the footballs (which at one point were all the same sport), you'll see multiple references to Christianity, and sport being used as a way for men to achieve or pursue the ""manliness"" that God/Jesus expects of men.  Basically, sports in school were pushed as a way for boys to become ""Godly men.""  The reason why football (the original) was used as that bastion of ""Christian masculinity"" was because the original football was a full contact sport: Tough, brutal, physical...something that reinforced society's expectations of ""masculinity."" 

Today, Rugby and Soccer have shed much of that influence, but that's also because they're very globally-played sports...thousands of people around the world, of many religions play them.  American football does not have the same reality.  It is still overwhelmingly played by Americans, and most who have access to the sport are overwhelmingly Christian (there's an intersection here of religion and socioeconomic status).  American Football simply hasn't faced the conflict of religion as part of the game like other more globally played sports have been.",1656633624

"ibs","t5_2s3g1","Has anything else changed in your life? Many meds have gastrointestinal side effects. My IBS also seemed to come out of nowhere, but I've noticed that coming off birth control has seriously decreased my symptoms. Not a medical study, but I've heard other people reporting gastro trouble on BC as well. 

 I'd always been sort of lactose intolerant, but started experiencing worse and worse symptoms (including pain so bad I thought I had arthritis in my joints and back). Pinpointing the trigger foods has allowed me to get back to a more normal life. No garlic and onions (trigger my inflammation pain), no beans other than canned in small amounts (rib-cracking gas pains), and no sugar alcohols (the -tol sweeteners). 

My best guess would be your matcha might have had a sweetener since macadamia milk is low FODMAP in that serving size. It could also be ""stacking"" aka many small doses of trigger foods adding up.

I'd definitely recommend having some Gas-X on hand to stop those terrible pains. 

Keep in mind that people don't tend to turn to support groups to report that everything is all good, no problems, life is normal. This is a biased corner of the internet. Things will normalize for you, you'll adapt, and you'll avoid those painful moments for the most part. Things will get better, I promise you.",1656633624

As there has been little love for it it probably won‚Äôt ever be included unless people all around the world really start competing in horseshoes. There is also quite a bit of luck involved, even at the highest level (depending on the rules) or, (using a different rule set) the skill ceiling would be too low as at the highest level they would be hitting shot after shot after shot, which would all count as 1 point. Comparing it to, for example, shooting you have a gradient and it‚Äôs very rare for two shots to have the same amount of points whereas here all hits would count the same.

* a compilation of footage from the on-stage camera the boyz use throughout the performance.
* an HD copy of the ""Gamers of the Night"" lyric video (what plays on the screen as they perform the song)
* (there could be easter eggs, but I haven't found any)

I was inside the building in the sunken village which has the tent in it. I bunkered up behind the tent and when the first two rushed in (with the MDR and a vpo), I dropped the first guy with a headshot from my AK-74. 2nd guy headpeeks to the left and fires a couple shots before I manage to tap him in the forehead. Queue guy number three who manages to see me through the window and get a shot on me with the Rem 700. Blacks out my arm and I'm red basically everywhere else. I manage to lie down and crawl into the corner to heal and as I do so he starts peppering the walls trying to wall-bang me. As soon as my bleeds are patched up, I hear him moving towards the entryway and so I move up just enough to barely see outside, waiting for them to silhouette against the light. He pops through and I swing, but I run out of ammo. He takes another few wild shots inside as I jump around like a mad man while I reload. As soon as I can I return a few shots and he moves out of my view to get to his friends bodies. Poor man had just emptied his mag. As I recognize his error, I hear him open his inventory.

"nonmonogamy","t5_2rc24","This may be fine or it could be bad, but it probably depends on how he talks about it. Some people just aren't really all that jealous, so getting over infidelity isn't that hard. Other people find it a fundamental betrayal of trust. Other people find it somewhere in the middle.   


And then there are the reasons people cheat. Some people cheat because they're assholes. Some cheat because they're lonely. Some because they connected with someone when they needed to and it turned sexual. Some because they needed validation. Some because they crave novelty. And sometimes its because they really want to end the relationship they're in, but they don't want to be the one to pull the trigger.   


If this guy is bitter about his wife cheating, it may be a sign that any relationship with him will be dramatic. If he's largely fine with it, different story. If he also cheated, that may be a good sign - but if he totally blames the wife, probably not.   


And they're reasons to stay together also matter. Be wary of the ""it's for the kids"" thing because if the only reason you're bothering to salvage your relationship with someone is because of a 3rd party (even shared kids), you're done with that person. if it's because they love each other and are just fine with not being monogamous? Different story.",1656633625

Given the anus is a muscle not every guy is fit to take every kind of dick which is a bigger deal than it sounds. Not every guy on the street is a porn star or kinky enough to be a size king so there's some hesitation there as well.

It also takes a mountain of prep work to actually get ready for anal (unless you like poop in which case, uh, good on you I guess). So for example on a late night, or after heavy drinking or the morning after I'm just not in the frame of mind or mood to get up, clean out and then fuck. Mind I keep forgetting condoms so that might help a bit but for the most part most of the guys I've been with we've stuck to oral.

A ‚Äúpretense‚Äù is an understanding arrived at ahead of time.

The ‚Äúpretense‚Äù can be the social convention at play or the polite public reason for something to occur, while also sometimes implying there‚Äôs an actual deeper reason that is not stated.

‚ÄúFalse pretense‚Äù means one party is being disingenuous when they are stating their reason for doing something ahead of time. While a ‚Äúpretense‚Äù that conceals a true motivation might be a sort of white lie one tells to play nice, a ‚Äúfalse pretense‚Äù gives a greater sense of malicious deception. For example, ‚ÄúThe CEO called a board meeting under the false pretense of corporate restructuring, instead announcing that the company had declared bankruptcy.‚Äù",1656633626

As for your case about Bennet if you‚Äôre pairing him with Tigh you wouldn‚Äôt want to bring electro anyway you‚Äôd probably bring a hydro unit. It‚Äôs true that introducing a reaction might not be gain, but since given how much stronger current reactions are when compared to Geo it‚Äôs pretty safe to assume a triple reaction would out more damage than a double Geo Dendro flex team (if you‚Äôre adamant about using Tigh as an example I would simply say he‚Äôs one charged dps user, there‚Äôs still a lot of other DPS play styles that don‚Äôt require Jade Shield (Childe, Ayato, Raiden, and if we assume Cryo has reactions with Dendro as hinted above we could also include Ganyu and Ayaka, and even if they did need a shield it would be from Diona due to EM share to Dendro and Elegy buff). A double Geo Tigh Yae team sounds cool, but we still don‚Äôt know the numbers on any reactions yet.

I think we play similar so I would say go for Japan cruisers. You need to play like a ninja for them to work but the fires are great and you get to play with legit torps every now and then.

Des Moines is a whole different play style but the guns are 5.5 second reload. Haven‚Äôt touched my DM much though just because I‚Äôm trying to pad my damage for the cruiser emblem as sad as that is lol
DM can be huge for a control point push though because the USA line you get radars later on at like tier 8 and 5.5 sec reload you can eat up destroyers but battleships over pen you and that‚Äôs never fun.

That‚Äôs just from my experience so far. Once I get Hindenburg and mess with those for awhile I‚Äôll grind up another line ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

He's on an upward trajectory which is what you want to see in a promising prospect, but the fact that he was ice cold against AAA level pitching just 2-3 months ago means he probably isn't ready for the largest talent jump in professional baseball from AAA to the majors. 118 OPS+ is nice if you're putting up those numbers against major league pitching, but he's doing that against mostly AAAA guys and roster filler pitchers in AAA. Teeing off on the kind of lefties you find in AAA like Thomas Szapucki and Locke St. John doesn't mean you're ready for Clayton Kershaw and Josh Hader.  

  &gt;I don‚Äôt care about the Ks if he puts up those numbers.  

  That's the problem, BABIP drops sharply from AAA to the majors so he's very literally not going to put up the same numbers in the bigs if you're tacking on an out on strikes 1/3 of the time at the plate. All other things equal, he's going to strike out MORE in the majors than in AAA just on the basis of better pitching and there's absolutely no amount of power that makes striking out 40% of the time stand up (just look at 2022 Joey Gallo if you don't believe me).",1656633629

It doesn't hinder their efforts to obtain power by demoralizing the anti-abortion base because it leaves in place the opportunity to ban abortion nationally, giving the anti-abortionists a concrete goal to rally around. The only way in which it threatens conservative power is that it is a very mask-off moment for the court, which is the conservative movement's primary weapon. Kavanaugh thought the trade off was worth it, Roberts didn't.

Yeah, I see where you are coming from.

This could increase, decrease, or be a wash for moral in either party, and that is yet to be seen.  Your position is a valid and thought thru position to take.

Like you, when half of my family (the crazy religious half) became pro-Trump I was incredibly angry and resentful.  And then eventually I had a need to understand why things had become the way they had been.  These are people who volunteer, take in children with mental disabilities, and otherwise are ethical.

Two reasons stand out - one is resentment as covered a bit here: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/blame-the-bobos-creative-class/619492/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/09/blame-the-bobos-creative-class/619492/)The second is part of (the crazy part) of my family is a one-issue Roe voter.

I don't assume people are acting in good faith and that is not my desire.  The Republican Party has lost its values and is irreparable.

But it is important to understand why people act the way they do, regardless of if that is not in good faith.  People tend to think they are doing the right thing, even when what they are doing is incredibly harmful.   Understanding the root of their decisioning process, even if it is completely nuts, allows you to understand what you are up against, and how to pick some people off to your tent.  Sometimes a very small number of people makes a big difference.",1656633629

Imagine being hit in the face with something like that!!! I don't believe for a minute that Ronnie Watts ""didn't care."" I can't imagine everything going through his head. 

His daughter-in-law, who he didn't necessarily like (at all) but probably didn't want anything bad to happen to was missing. His 2 granddaughters who he clearly loved very much were missing. He had to take a 3.5hr flight from NC to Denver, he was worried about his DIL, granddaughters, and son...and then to hear this....and know his son is likely going to prison for the rest of his life...

"ShuumatsuNoValkyrie","t5_vzop7","&gt; Sure someone as reputable as Thor would make him start off more serious but he wouldn‚Äôt use Tandava karma right off the bat

I mean honestly I would say a similar think about Thor. He doesn't just start with Thors Hammer, and instead only uses it if the opponent really pushes him to his limits. On that note, I don't really see how Thor would be able to use Thor's Hammer without Shiva possibly dodging it using the Treasure of Svarga (Which unlike Tandava Karma, is a move he can safely preform) and rushing in to hit Thor. Thor's fight with Lu Bu was very weird in that it was a fight of respect. Both opponents waited for the other to use their strongest move, and Thor even waited for Lu Bu to mount Red Hare despite having the ability to kill him right there. But I don't think a fight between Shiva and Thor would necessarily play out like that, for Shiva to wait until Thor winds up Mjolnir Thor's Hammer (Oh yeah, also Thor's gloves how could I have forgotten them, there is no evidence that they would get broken for Thor to use an awakened Mjolnir, since Lu Bu only broke them because that was his valkryie's ability). I honestly think, we need to know more about both of these fighters (especially Thor) in order to arrive at a better answer. 

But yeah, I think it's fair enough to think that Thor would win more times, although I think the opposite",1656633630

Basically the American critic made some comment about Finnegan's Wake and Burgess blustered: ""**Of course** I understand Finnegan's Wake!"") Likewise blanking on the US critic...iirc it was the famous-in-literary-circles-African-American/Creole writer? Shit, this is going to do my head in--I'm thinking his first name was maybe Augustus or Augustine? I think WSB was said to have put a ""curse"" on him after he murdered ""Western Lands"" in print. Burroughs saw him as the ""Assayer Of Scribes"" which I believe was a prestigious title in the the Third Dynasty of Ancient Egypt-almost a state censor, if you will. Apparently the critic lost his prestigious position at a  very large newspaper afterwards.

"finalfantasytactics","t5_2w6ny","Yeah and that‚Äôs part of why it‚Äôs the worse translation. You not liking the WotL dialogue doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs objectively a better and more cohesive translation. 

You say it doesn‚Äôt fit the tone. I don‚Äôt understand how you can come to the conclusion that bland, modernized and Americanized dialogue fits a Medieval fantasy setting better than dialogue that is written in a more traditional olde English style. 

The mods really just need to sticky two threads on this sub, one for each translation, for people bitch on and ban this topic because these conversations are always so tedious. 

You like the original. Good for you. You liking it doesn‚Äôt make it good and you disliking the WotL translation doesn‚Äôt make it bad. Things like inconsistencies and spelling mistakes make the original bad. A cohesive tone and style as well as more accurate translations make the new one better. No one is saying you have to like the WotL version. But your assertions that the OG is better, fits the game better, or fits the style of game better are all wrong.

^(By: Cynthia Hand, Brodi Ashton, Jodi Meadows | 512 pages | Published: 2016 | Popular Shelves: historical-fiction, fantasy, young-adult, ya, romance)

&gt;Edward (long live the king) is the King of England. He‚Äôs also dying, which is inconvenient, as he‚Äôs only sixteen and he‚Äôd much rather be planning for his first kiss than considering who will inherit his crown‚Ä¶
&gt;
&gt;Jane (reads too many books) is Edward‚Äôs cousin, and far more interested in books than romance. Unfortunately for Jane, Edward has arranged to marry her off to secure the line of succession. And there‚Äôs something a little odd about her intended‚Ä¶
&gt;
&gt;Gifford (call him G) is a horse. That is, he‚Äôs an E√∞ian (eth-y-un, for the uninitiated). Every day at dawn he becomes a noble chestnut steed‚Äîbut then he wakes at dusk with a mouthful of hay. It‚Äôs all very undignified.
&gt;
&gt;The plot thickens as Edward, Jane, and G are drawn into a dangerous conspiracy. With the fate of the kingdom at stake, our heroes will have to engage in some conspiring of their own. But can they pull off their plan before it‚Äôs off with their heads?

Here's a second link if the first one doesn't work:

Thoughts?

If it is, an 8 wk course of doxy (an antibiotic that is very commonly used for skin issues) might help.

"Desoxyn","t5_3ho6g","It heavily depends on the country and there's no getting around doing a fair share of research (even for more common controlled substances, let alone Desoxyn). Some places to try:

\- [https://www.incb.org/incb/en/travellers/country-regulations.html](https://www.incb.org/incb/en/travellers/country-regulations.html) ‚Äî based on voluntarily submitted short standardized forms. even when present, these are often not entirely filled out, but they will have phone/email of a regulatory body of the said country

\- the country's border police website

\- the country's health ministry / controlled substances office website

\- it's likely the above will not have a lot of useful information, so you might want to email these respective offices

\- your local embassy of the said country ‚Äî you could call or email them, they might be able to get you an answer sooner than contacting these department by yourself

In general, you would want to clarify all of these things:

\- is it acceptable to bring medication X into the country as a tourist? (depends on the country &amp; their controlled substance schedules. some may lump methamphetamine into the broad amphetamines category, some may have special scheduling for methamphetamine). reiterate that methamphetamine is a valid prescription medication in your country

  \- in case of Desoxyn, I would unroll this as two separate questions: 1) are amphetamine-based medications like Adderall permitted? if no, there's no point in digging deeper, if yes... 2) is methamphetamine treated differently than \[dextro\]amphetamine

\- is it necessary to obtain any permits or authorizations beforehand? (some countries will require this for all or certain controlled medications, some countries will only require this if you're trying to bring a greater-than-normally-allowed quantity, etc)

\- does the medication need to be declared in the border? (countries like Canada require you to declare all controlled medications when crossing the border, otherwise you're ""smuggling""; in contrast, for EU countries, you usually don't have to)

\- are there quantity limits? (usually limited to a 30 days' supply)

\- what other documents are required? (often, you'd need to carry an official letter from your doctor stating that you're bringing Y quantity of X medication which you need for the Z condition)",1656633634

"notinteresting","t5_2u0xf","Story time because some how an image of a fridge cured my 2 year writers block, I used to write better but I'm working with a picture of a fridge and a couple shots of whiskey so bare with it. The fridge is tired of not being cleaned out. It's tired of all the old expired food and absolutely disgusting freezer. We are witnessing it in it's last moments as it remembers the good times. The time when it was installed and loved. It's original owners took great care of it, and the memories stuck on the fridge had entered the fridge's mind. It watched a young family grow up, from the mom grabbing ham and cheese for a sandwich to the young adult son coming home absolutely wasted searching and searching through the fridge for anything to eat. Unfortunately after the daughter had gone off to college both the mother and father where shot in their home. Luckily the son was away but now he had to pick up another job and lost a lot of his free time just to get by. The house got messier and messier, the son got more and more depressed. Alcohol was his only joy, but it was tearing him apart. To make matters worse, 3 months later the son's sister was brutally raped and murdered. The son had no one left. His drinking got out of hand so his friends had left him, and due to awful people he had no family left. A week later he quit his jobs after having enough money for what he needed to do. He acquired a gun and went into the house. He downed some Whiskey hoping to go with at least a little euphoria. However, as he approached the fridge what he saw killed him inside. Pictures of his sister, young and happy, and then older and excited to head off to college. He saw pictures of his parents, just married and so many other happy family photos. He couldn't take it, he fell to the floor on his knees and screamed. ""WHY! WHY WAS MY FAMILY TAKEN AWAY FROM ME! WHY?! WHY!? WHY?!"" At this point he was crying very loudly, while repeatedly screaming why. He had already had a bit to drink, but he needed more. He slammed down every memory on the fridge. All the lovely photos, the childhood drawings, taken off and slammed as hard as possible on the ground. He yanked the fridge door open and grabbed the Gentleman Jack, his only comfort left. He took the lid off and chugged the bottle as fast as he could, finishing it concerninly quickly. He slammed the bottle on the ground, causing it to shatter instantly. At this point he wasn't crying, the emotion was out. He silently walked over to the couch, feeling a void of emotion as big as the void in his heart without his family. He grabbed the gun he had purchased, and set it on the table. He started loading the clip, one bullet at a time. He only needed one, but hoped maybe the liquor would kick in if he took his time. It did kick in, but it wasn't enough. He could tell he was drunk but the emptiness was still there. He loaded the gun and cocked it back, and proceeded to stumble his way back to the fridge. He fell to the ground where he had thrown all the memories of his family. He held the most recent family photo and looked at it for a while. Imaging the good times they shared allowed him to smile for the first time in a long time, before he once again started crying. He didn't have the energy to scream anymore, he didn't have the motivation to try anymore. He grabbed his loaded gun, cocked it back, aimed it up the roof of his mouth and shot it. Looking back on this the fridge thought it was upset due to the poor upkeep, but it realized something. What it was really upset was losing those who loved it. Yeah the ice maker has been broken for about 5 months, but does that really matter from all the great times it saw and was able to feel through the front of the door? The fridge inched closer to the edge, ready to be with the family it loved once again. Also side note: I can't believe the first thing I write after taking such a long break is about an image of a fridge LMAO. Maybe I do still have that creativity I thought I lost...",1656633634

"slowcooking","t5_2s64w","Not OP, but I make a vegetable crockpot lasagna for my vegetarian daughter and we all love it. From The Modern Proper. I skip the mushrooms.  We use a spicy Arrabiata sauce. 

Using fresh basil is a must, as is placing a clean kitchen towel between the lid of the crock pot and the lasagna. I cook on high between 3-4 hours and overlap the noodles each layer (break them to size). Hope someone loves it as much as we do. 

Ingredients

‚Öì cup basil, chopped

15 oz container ricotta cheese

2 large eggs

1 tsp salt

1 tsp garlic powder

¬Ω tsp ground pepper

25 oz jar pasta sauce

1 lb box lasagna noodles

8 oz mushrooms, sliced

2 small zucchini, sliced

2 small yellow squash, sliced

2 cups spinach, roughly chopped

16 oz mozzarella, grated

8 oz fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced parmesan, to taste
 
Method

In a medium bowl combine the basil, ricotta, eggs, salt, garlic powder and pepper.
In a 5 qt crock pot spread ¬º cup of pasta sauce and top with a single layer of uncooked lasagna noodles. Follow by spreading ‚Öì of the ricotta mixture.
Next layer a third of each kind of vegetable (mushroom, zucchini and yellow squash) and top with ‚Öì of the chopped spinach and then ‚Öì of the grated mozzarella. Lastly, layer with 1/4 of remaining sauce.
Starting with the dried lasagna, repeat all of the above steps two more times. Finish with a layer of dried pasta, remaining sauce and a layer of fresh mozzarella.
Place a clean kitchen towel between the lid and the slow cooker to catch any excess liquid produced by the steam in the crock pot.
Cook on high heat for three hours, until the noodles are tender and the sauce is absorbed.
Finish with fresh parmesan cheese and any extra basil you have on hand.",1656633635

Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.

No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.

You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.

Do you have a degree in that field?

A college degree? In that field?

Then your arguments are invalid.

No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.

Correlation does not equal causation.

CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.

You still haven't provided me a valid source yet.

Nope, still haven't.

A man is driving through the country on his way from Florida to California. Looking at his fuel gauge, he decided to stop at the next gasoline station and fill up. About 15 minutes later, he spots a station and pulls over to the high octane pump.‚ÄúWhat can I do for y‚Äôall?‚Äù asks the attendant. ‚ÄúFill \`er up with high test,‚Äù replies the driver. As the attendant is searching for the gas cap,  the driver points out it is behind the left taillight.  As the attendant fills the tank, he's eyeing the car up and down.‚ÄúWhat kinda car is this?‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúI never seen one like it before.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù responds the driver, his chest swelling up with pride, ‚Äúthis, my boy is a classic Cadillac.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat all‚Äôs it got in it?‚Äù asks the attendant. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù says the driver, ‚Äúit has everything. It‚Äôs loaded with power steering, power seats, power sun roof, power mirrors, 8 speaker stereo, rack and pinion steering,disk brakes all around, leather interior, digital instrument package, and best of all, a 9.4 liter V8 engine!‚Äù‚ÄúWow,‚Äù says the attendant, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs really something!‚Äù

 ‚ÄúDon't forget the windshield.""

"GreatXboxDeals","t5_38xm9","SO. The genre is extraction battle royale.

Birds eye view:

You spawn on a map filled with dangerous and loud npc monsters that you have to take out or avoid while ALSO avoiding or killing other players. On each map you find clues that point you towards the location of a bounty.

A bounty is a boss monster that you kill and collect a token from. Once you have a token your objective is to extract/leave/survive. Extracting is the endgame. Extract and you win even if there are other bounties or players on the map.

Details:

Its a battle royale so if you die and have no teammates, you lose and lose your hunter and loot. Loot is everything from guns to consumables like grenades. You can also find items that grant cash or extra experience. Those are fun to find lol.

If you lose a hunter, you get a free one for each round you complete. If you BUY a hunter, you get loot along with them that kind of match the cash you spend.

Aggressive play is rewarded but smart play results in some of the most satisfying gameplay you can find in a shooter. Outsmarting sweats is the most fun. Im talkin lvl 37 prestige players that do nothing else. lol.

Overall:

Its a fantastic game that allows you to be tactical, sneaky, loud, quiet. Lining up shots feels good and playing at 60 fps now is amazing. There is a learning curve but the less you care about losing the better in early stages. Just enjoy the atmosphere and depth.

Edit: And yes, its strictly multiplayer! Sorry.",1656633640

Ms Marvel: Introduce Kamala Khan, Cosmic Storyline

Thor LaT: Cosmic/God Storyline.

Some shows are just character introduction, only Loki so far has been signifigant to furthering the current plot. All the films from Eternals onward have been more important. Eventually the Cosmic/god storylines and the multiversal ones will crossover, probably with Kang the Conquerer or the F4.

The folks I'm chatting with see it as the best outcome for a horrible necessity.

Ideally, we stay in the Pac forever, but it's becoming more and more obvious that this is untenable. The Pac is dying. Larry Scott really did a number on it and combined with a general west coast culture shift away from sports in general, I'm not sure it can survive.
There are SC fans who felt that their media draw (not their performance... goodness knows not that) has been just about the only thing that's kept the conference viable at all over the past decade or so.
I make a point of going to an away game every year. There's no denying attendance has been down everywhere. USC UW had tons of empty seats the last time I was up there in 2019. That just didn't happen before. They still have good fans in the Pacific Northwest. and yet...
It's just all been too much: The bad kickoff times, the secondary networks, the refusal to give up on the P12 network, the awful AWFUL refs who are determined to ruin every game they call by making it a ticky tacky slog... It's all added up to less eyes, less fun games, less fans, and less money.

We see the Pac as gutshot. What we're excited about and find amazing is that USC is leading instead of following. That NEVER happened. The Pac has a really goofy schedule because USC refused to give up ""The Weekender"" trip to the Bay Area every year. We are stodgy, old, and tradition soaked. I was CERTAIN we'd go down with the Pac's ship.  We're really happy to be out in front of the train wreck for once

So yeah, we hate the move, but we see it as necessary and are therefor thrilled that we're actually doing what is necessary to continue to compete.

Me personally:  I am not excited about trading away games in Seattle, San Francisco, and Boulder for Minneapolis, Columbus, and Lincoln.",1656633640

When you have a kid slamming your face in the bathroom and flushing it, when you have someone slam their fist into your gut/groin, when it's actually done in a setting you have no control over... That's the only time you get to bitch and moan over it. 

Edit: teabagging is just a silent taunt used for when you can't speak in game.

If you don't like the simple act of teabagging, which came about because most of our games didn't have emotes in them hence the use of the crouch function; because most competitive games like cod and halo had crouch, then don't play the game.

If you don't want the N word abused in chat, stay off Mordhou

If you don't like teabagging, stay off shooters.

If you don't like someone saying your gear is shit, stay off MMORPG's.

If you don't like kids, stay off amongus, fortnight, five nights at Freddy's or what ever other game they're playing. 

You're not forced to play any video games, unlike the kids whose dad's throw them in little league to live out their dreams through their kids. You know, the ones whose dad's won't stop taking them after they say they don't wanna do it.

For some small background, I (16f) already have a pretty rocky relationship with my dad (45).. Well, last week i heard my mom (42) and her fianc√© (50m) come home with her sobbing. And if any of you have eastern european parents, you know that if they can‚Äôt bottle up what they‚Äôre feeling then something serious happened. As someone who‚Äôs very protective of her i rushed downstairs to find out what happened.. 
Turns out my dad has been lying to her for almost 10 years about paying off the money he owes to the govt, which means the money she‚Äôs supposed to get back has been going towards that debt. Instantly called my dad and called him things like a fucking liar, a pos, and many other things. He began to say i shouldn‚Äôt talk to him that way. i think this is where i might‚Äôve taken it too far when i told him he doesn‚Äôt deserve to tell me what to do because he isn‚Äôt the one who raised me or acted like a parent and all he has is the title of ‚Äúdad.‚Äù

So, AITA for going off on my dad?

It becomes interesting because it probably comes down to saving throws - and the elf is really useful because it grants advantage against charm. The Rune Knight triggers the Stone Rune (of which they have two) to tell the Zealot to chill - but it's a charm effect. On saving throws after the first, of course, the Storm Rune is handing out disadvantage (canceling the elf). But there's still that first save, and the question of whether the barbarian spent their ""free"" feat for proficiency in wisdom saves.",1656633642

Das Rotfahren mit dem Rad ist damit vergleichsweise eine Lappalie, und m√ºsste dann eigentlich weitaus weniger kosten. 

Wenn wir von Faktor 10 ausgehen, was noch konservativ ist (durchschnittliches Rad mit FahrerIn: sagen wir 100kg, durchschnittliches Auto: weit √ºber 1 Tonne bewegte Masse) m√ºsste das Rotfahren auf dem Rad dann 20‚Ç¨ kosten statt 200. 

Was es kostet ist mir aber eigentlich auch egal. Leute sollen nur um Himmels willen aufh√∂ren, diese Dinge moralisch gleichzusetzen.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I'd like to start off and say I appreciate your responses and engaging honestly with me without vitriol.

I can agree on your first point that we do have a disconnect at that point. I think a developing fetus that has a reasonably good shot at living and developing into a healthy human being (personally I still consider a fetus to be human) should be granted that chance. They are conscious after a point and can move and kick and start to do things. Even if we disagree on personhood, there is a stage where a fetus is more of a person than a zygote, and it's a grey area, but it's incredibly uncomfortable to say anyone has the right to kill them without due cause. I can undertand the reasoning that if you don't want them it will reflect on their upbringing and life, but that seems like a copout. Should we also exterminate people in poor environments who will never lead happy lives? Because that seems like the same type of reasoning, just without the bodily autonomy argument. I've said it before probably, but if you conceive a child, by bringing it into existence I think it kind of does have a right to have a reasonable shot at life.



Regarding your next point, if it's only about risk to others or how by birthing a child you choose not to relinquish responsibility, couldn't that also apply to an unborn child?

And regarding your last point, c'mon after a certain point a fetus is more than a clump of cells. Or by that same logic we all are clumps of cells. Why is it ok when it's still depending on you after you created it? Children have rights to the bodies or rather life and labor of parents.



I don't think we're ever going to come to an agreement, but I'll concede that eaely term abortions before way consciousness or some other benchmark are not extremely immoral, but there has to be some point you admit the fetus is more human than not. What if abortions were only allowed in the early stages?",1656633646

Have you tried an audio soundtrack? Audio can be powerful on its own; with a doll, I think could add a lot. Find some masturbation videos (with no male voice to intrude) to play for the sound. There are plenty to choose from, depending on what you like to hear.

Fiddle with the angles. Maybe try using a pillow under her butt in missionary, or a stack of pillows under her torso in doggy, to adjust the angle slightly.

Anyone I‚Äôve met (with one exception) who is genuinely wealthy has only been generous to people in their circle.

I thought of that because you mentioned empathy, and I think you‚Äôre right that truly wealthy people generally lack it.

Finances are an entirely different story and you're trying to conflate the two. You've never had a right to not pay something you're responsible for. A woman aborting isn't about her responsibility to the fetus, it's about her right to her body.",1656633646

At one point my ex and I moved into a nice townhouse he said he had rented as a surprise for me and that a friend had been staying there first cause she had nowhere to go. Outside phone calls he said were to his brother, became very secretive, then my mail key disappeared, and other stuff. Turned out the woman that had been staying there was someone he was dating behind my back and rented a townhouse (that was MUCH nicer than the apartment we had) for her and her kids and him. They broke up, he moved me in, then they started talking again and then a year and a half or so of misery and confusion followed for me.

You are struggling with a medical condition that requires assistance and he basically told you to kick rocks and figure it out yourself. So you did. He didn't want anyone coming over so you left to somewhere that would provide the care you needed.

He is a grown man, he can fend for himself, ESPECIALLY after shutting down and ignoring your SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITION. 

I know it sounds cliche but please reconsider your marriage. This is not the kind of behavior you should expect from a spouse. Whatever happened to ""in sickness and in health?"". My boyfriend of one month sprinted through Walmart two minutes before they closed to get me painkillers for my throat infection, drove me to the ER at 3am, and then held my hand and supported me through the whole ordeal. He went out to get my favorite flavor of ice cream every day (I never even asked, he just wanted to) to help sooth my throat. If a man that I had just started seeing off of Tinder will do all of that, your husband can at least try to pretend to care.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","**YTA.** There is a time and a place for the kind of immature shenanigans you and your ""friends"" indulge in, and your wedding (anyone's wedding) is not it. ESPECIALLY, when your wife had already communicated to you her discomfort and upset at said shenanigans. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the breakdown message I get from your own words;

You don't respect your wife

You don't care enough about your wife to even give her one solitary day (her wedding day) to behave as if you care about and respect your wife

You're immature and easily led and your ""friends"" have far too much sway over your behaviour (and not in a good way) and you bow to peer pressure at the drop of a hat

You're too immature to be in a serious relationship and shouldn't have bothered getting married

Your wife would be well justified in getting an annulment 

&amp;#x200B;

If you think any of these statements are an unfair assessment of who you are, then you should reflect on the attitudes, choices, and behaviours you show to the world to give that poor impression of you. and if you really care - you'll do something to change those things. Coz from where I'm sitting your own words are so very damning of yourself.",1656633648
"awfuleverything","t5_346d4","In [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/vo5cp4/poor_child/iec8te0), you singled out the line ""there's literally 0 scenarios where it's justifiable to compromise their vegan diet"", but it was in an entire section that had quotation marks around it, and a **not** in front of the quotations, and you just conveniently left that **not** out

Likewise, in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/vo5cp4/poor_child/ied3x8v), you claimed I said the following, and you put the entire phrase in quotes:

&gt; ""Not every single baby absolutely needs to be vegan because they can drink breast milk and there's literally 0 scenarios where it's justifiable to compromise their vegan diet"" 

But in [my original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/awfuleverything/comments/vo5cp4/poor_child/iec7wdq), it doesn't show up like that because the entire part after the word **not** is in quotes. I was pointing out that I did **not** say the part that follows. 

Removing the quotes and lumping it all together makes it seem like the **not** only applies to the first half of the sentence, and that I genuinely meant the second part. But if you keep the quotes in, it shows that the **not** applies to the first **and** second half of the sentence

So if you want me to split it up, it would read: 

&gt; I said ""Babies should be vegan for the first several months because breast milk is vegan"". I did NOT say ""Every single baby absolutely needs to be vegan because they can drink breast milk"" and I did NOT say ""there's literally 0 scenarios where it's justifiable to compromise their vegan diet""

It's like if I commented the math problem -1 *(2 + 3) and then you kept representing it like -1 * 2 + 3",1656633648

"romancelandia","t5_397xyk","I was just trying to use the lecture hall example to show why Horny Wednesday could be considered inappropriate because people seemed confused about what the objection to HW was. I was trying to show how some topics can go beyond the boundaries of a relationship even if it's not explicitly sexual, since there are a lot of comments asking how HW could possibly be a problem for anyone. The boundaries of the relationship most subreddit members have to each other (including those who aren't part of the group that posts frequently) seem closer to classmates than friends to me, and I was trying to show how what might be okay for friends isn't always okay for classmates, again purely as an analogy for the issue some people have with HW. The classmates analogy is also meant to show how not wanting to discuss certain things with other people isn't about shaming them, it's just about the type of relationship boundaries you want to have. 

Regardless, I have never been advocating for anything other than getting rid of HW (and not continuing with Smash or Pass, but again, for reasons unrelated to sexual content) and keeping the existing rule against discussions of people's personal sex lives. 

I understand that you and some others interpreted my posts to be asking for something broader but I'm trying to make clear now that that's not what meant.",1656633648

As the husband of a new mother, your number one job is to take of her so she can take of the baby. You need to spend time reinforcing to her that you find her beautiful, to not worry about the baby weight or any other issues he may have with her body right now - those are battle scars from creating life. Don't get frustrated, even if you find yourself saying the same thing several times a day. Consider what must be going through her head and be the supportive husband she needs right now. It's going to be tough for a while, and your needs - whatever they may be - will not be adequately met for some time. Accept that now, do your best to put on a strong front, and be her support. It will pay off in spades down the line.

They're not very open to new players or old players that haven't played in a while. I remember trying to find a crew a few months ago on the Discord and nobody would let me in despite being Pirate Legend with more than 100 hours in the game. Everyone was saying only Legendary Sea Dogs can play with us, and when I pointed out that I'm comfortable with PvP, and I cannot get to LSD because arena has been shut down, they did not care.

"BloodOnTheClocktower","t5_ioxkd","&gt;Why do you think it's an objective fact? I've linked to words from the creator of the game himself. I haven't heard you rebuttal that point.

What's to rebut? The quote you've posted states the purpose of madness, but says absolutely nothing about whether ""breaking madness"" is ever cheating. You also say that ""no one is arguing whether players can or cannot say whatever they want""...and yet, that is what this entire discussion is about, you can't have it both ways.

If the rulebook and the games developers are not sufficient evidence for you, and lacking any amount of evidence that ""breaking madness"" is ever cheating, there's really nowhere else to go with this conversation.

I suppose for anyone who wants the extra reading, here's one of the more recent comments from Evin, only 10 days ago, explaining how ""breaking madness"" away from the Storyteller is not cheating. [https://www.reddit.com/r/BloodOnTheClocktower/comments/q5s2w1/comment/hg7mzmt/?utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/BloodOnTheClocktower/comments/q5s2w1/comment/hg7mzmt/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&gt;For players breaking madness, it's not cheating to break madness and it's not cheating to try and hide your madness breaks from the Storyteller.

If this and the rulebook still does not suffice for you, hopefully it will for others. I will kindly cease participating in this discussion now.

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","New terms sometimes help define a concept as old terms become too loaded and prevent people from listening.

Reading that article, it seemed at first that right after using the term, the author wanted to wrap globalism, nazism, communism and all the other ""isms"" into the term.

But, I'm glad I stuck with it. Eventually I learn that it's a term dealing with the ""liberalism [that] emphasizes a concern for the aggrieved and underprivileged."" Okay -- so, that's like how we have so much emphasis in Human Resources on microaggressions and sending non-minorities (e.g., white privileged old white man dudes who said something that pissed someone off, or, didn't say something the right way, or, needed to be taken down a peg) to have a talking to by HR. Yes. The people NOT in charge who enjoy white privilege but, not to a great extent, who join up with disgruntled Republicans because of the identity politics and the other overly sensitive stuff.

We don't do a damn thing to change the police. Or the economic status quo. Other than to swap deck chairs and complain about racism and sexism that didn't have much impact. Sorry -- that will get me in trouble with people who have been traumatized. But, basically we've got people with REAL traumas, competing with people who have trauma allergies. You know, like someone who smells a peanut and breaks out in hives? Someone who excessively ""mansplained"" that one time or said ""you people."" 

Yes. I know. What passes for liberalism now is basically the complaint box at HR.

&gt;This ‚Äúliberalism‚Äù dimension of managerial liberalism is merely a performative ideology. 

So, now I'm getting the picture of how someone is given a whole bunch of keys instead of a raise and a new title that sounds important -- and THAT is the change we can believe in.

Of course -- backtracking to nazism, communism, etcetera -- THOSE don't seem to care much about the aggrieved minorities -- one puts them in a compound for labor, and the other for training.

Yes, but bureaucratic paternalism fits -- why not use that word?

Fourth Political Theory. Well, I do appreciate allowing for different societies to organically express themselves. I'm not a fan of trying to fit square pegs in round holes to create unity.

Well, I hope it's going the right way, and they aren't trying to find new ways to sneak in the old racism. 

&gt;of people finally sufficiently awake to make one last effort to regain their freedoms and reassert their unique cultures. 

What is stopping anyone in America from having unique culture, other than chain stores?

&gt;The greatest vitriol among the stormtroopers of the managerial class is reserved for those who ‚Äúsuperficially‚Äù represent as one of these identities but reject the collectivist dimension of that identity.

Yes -- I can definitely see this and I call it out to liberals I'm interacting with. I think the word they are searching for here is ""cultural appropriation."" When someone not of a ""shared experience"" of their own heritage, strays off the reservation to ""cosplay"" as another group. Why, is that an insult? What about people are in my group that I find embarrassing? In essence; how does any individual represent anyone but themselves if we believe in free expression? 

&gt;but, returning to our main point of discussion, also the specific contours of the Russian military incursion into Ukraine.

Yeah, that was the weird bit in the beginning that I was curious how they could explain it...

&gt;Let‚Äôs leave aside whether your sympathy for such mistreated people (assuming they truly are mistreated) is merely the product of your own specific culture or whether it taps into some deep human universal empathy for the suffering (perceived or otherwise) of others

We are on the razors edge here. I can agree that ""different but equal"" can mean that some lady in a hijab doesn't feel diminished by it. We associate it with the paternally abusive societies -- but that doesn't mean the ""different roles"" follows the ""lower status"" of women in certain cultures.

In an aside, they also explain their issues with WEF; https://thecirculationofelites.substack.com/p/february-23-2022?s=r
While I see that Europe might want to disrupt the US -- also Russia does. And the same goes for religious extremists who know that suffering and chaos lead to more people in church. 

&gt;If the term ‚Äútotalitarian‚Äù gets up the hackles of some4, it certainly seems fair to describe it as a global administrative structure of social engineering governance, backed by mass propaganda and surveillance, and surgical coercion.

""surgical coercion"" -- exactly why I think that privacy rights are the only way to have a Democracy and it's ultimately, the most important issue. Not JUST because of scam artists, recruiters and those looking to extort want your data -- it's because this is the key to manufactured consent. People barely understand that they aren't making most of their decisions consciously, much less how manipulated they are. If they get some fairly good AI going, then every human could be assigned a ""watcher"" and then in their benign social engineering, someone can work a way to recruit that person into a specialized cult of one -- one AI handler. Playing them like a music instrument. From this, data points will be used to chaotically control everyone into the right vectors of a seamless, managed society. Whether this is a horror or not depends on who controls the reigns - but the problem is; the reigns. NOBODY should have this power -- until of course, we have a  benevolent uber mind. Yeah, reading sci-fi, those can fail in exciting ways as well.

Anyway. I don't like plans that try an domesticate humans instead of empowering them.

Yes. This is the nightmare I worry about. You've got fascists like Murdoch and Koch, against dominionists, bankers, anarchists and now ""do gooder management"". Like I've tried to tell people who have simple conspiracies; it's a mess -- it's everyone with a faction all at once.

However, I wonder if this group isn't simplifying things a bit to fit them into this world view of managerial class. They seem to leave out disaster capitalism, simple greed, and those who just want to see the world burn.

In other words; I can't get into Tony Blair's or Justin Trudeau's head. Mostly because, all of media is constantly fitting things to ""stories"" and narratives of what they have in their heads.

The protests in Ottawa were fit into some liberal ""MAGA"" narrative -- and helped by those in the USA who wanted to adopt them. I had no idea what the real issue was, and perhaps, maybe a lot of the people who joined in didn't know why they were party-protesting. It might have looked like fun. It might have been a collective farting. Here I'm reading that it was about this ""great reset."" And -- that is probably a watch word now and getting a hundred spins on it.

&gt;It turns out that there are large parts of the world, still, that want nothing to do with managerial liberalism

As far as I can tell, that's just the ""right to marginalize gay people"" in Russia. It's just turning back the clock to 1950's American culture and saying ""this works for me."" WHAT wonder is Russia preserving and what does that have to do with bombing cities in Ukraine, pray tell? Staying out of debt with the World Bank and IMF -- that I can understand.

I think that he's someone who has a ""garbage in-garbage out"" problem. The issue with fields of inquiry like UFO's is that they only possibly exist at the ""long tails""... That is, it's almost certain that 99.999% (pick your number of 9's) is just wrong. But Vallee is someone who tries to take in everything and ""pattern match"", hence ""garbage-in-garbage-out.""

"Unexpected","t5_2w67q","Full story (I already posted this on another subreddit):

Rehan had a double whammy of electrocution leading to drowning. He had a cardiac arrest and lost consciousness. It was the presence of the doctors and nurses in church that were able to provide with immediate resuscitation. He was pulseless for over 40 minutes. Rehan was transferred to Pune Adventist hospital where as per government rules the incident was registered by the hospital as a police case.

He was stabilised and transferred to a larger hospital where he was put on a ventilator. His clinical condition was critical with the heart functioning at 14% and water in one of his lungs. His condition deteriorated with early signs of multi-organ failure. 24 hours later Rehan regained consciousness. He is still in a critical condition but is showing signs of improvement. His renal function is improving and his heart is functioning at about 55%.

His neurological status shows evidence of recent memory amnesia He does not fully recognise his parents or sister.

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

Finally, please make sure you read the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

If meal prep works better for you, then it‚Äôs really quick and easy to add to things like meat sauces, rice, or curries. I also buy things like pre shredded kale (for smoothies or saut√©ing) and baby carrots for snacking to save time. Another trick is making good sauces for meals. I make rice bowls with veggies and protein 3-4 days per week, and just switch up the sauce depending on my mood. 

Also, if you can manage, having one day where you prep bulk veggies/snacks that you can use throughout the week may work better with your ADHD. Alternatively, even though it‚Äôs a bit more pricey, just buying the pre-cut veggies might work better for you!",1656633654

The checksum is only used on the UI level of wallets. Once coins are sent, only the requirements are recorded on the blockchain. 


Most often the requirements for the BTC to move are either ""provide me a valid signature with a private key that corresponds to this specific public key X""; or ""provide a script that has this hash X and evaluates to true"".


So if you sent to an ""invalid"" address (you made a typo on the requirement part and your wallet ignored the checksum mismatch), you locked those coins with requirements that you won't be able to fulfill. It's infeasible to calculate the correct public key or script hash to satisfy the requirements. The BTC will be locked forever or until hashing / elliptic curve is broken.",1656633655

Furthermore, long run correlation can be done using long run historical data but short run dynamics cannot necessarily be done, this is the point of bivariate garch models with an evolving correlation. 

Finally, impulse response functions aren't a bad idea but they only give a sense of what happens to the mean, not to the volatility. Once again, if we want to know what happens to the volatility, we're gonna need a garch model.

"linux_gaming","t5_2r2u0","Tangentially related: I find these days it's quite useful for to be able to ""install ancient packages""....  well, to a chroot.  Nice lightweight alternative to full container or virtual machine or emulation, given it's not for security just binary compat for games.

Think various game binaries that were released natively for linux in the 32-bit era that were compiled against ancient library versions and are pretty unlikely to be ever recompiled for modern 64-bit linux distros now, since the devs have long since moved on or gone out of business.  Feels weird to call stuff from the early 21st century retro, but I guess it might be by now.

So the [schroot utility in debian](https://wiki.debian.org/Schroot) is very handy for this. 

With that, you can run latest Debian 11+ but have an old 32-bit Debian 9/Stretch or even earlier chroot that you can drop into to run old stuff. All without cluttering your main install with weird old 32-bit compat and libraries. Yes, even though ""multilib"" has long meant you can have both 32-bit and 64-bit at once in your main install in theory, for such, uh, recent-retro gaming you now also need *crazy old versions of* 32-bit packages in some cases, and that's becoming very messy ...if you don't simply wall them off in their own ancient-distro chroot.",1656633656

You need to talk to him about what happened so he understands what he did and that it wasn't okay. From there work on better communication, and he needs to take responsibility for how he treat you.

"Scams","t5_2qrt0","AutoModerator has been summoned to explain the Amazon review scam (credit to user SuwanneeValleyGirl). Amazon review scammers are trying to buy 5 star reviews without looking like they‚Äôre buying 5 star reviews. A long time ago, sellers could offer free or discounted coupon codes to buyers in exchange for an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù review. [This practice was banned in 2016](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/innovation/update-on-customer-reviews), replaced by Amazon‚Äôs Vine program. [FTC rules](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2009/10/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials) also dictate that any reviews or product promotions obtained in this way have to be clearly labeled as such. To get around both the FTC‚Äôs labeling rules and Amazon‚Äôs ban, there are websites and private Facebook groups that link together shady sellers with people willing to sell positive reviews. These shady sellers are usually Chinese, selling cheap products that would otherwise not receive positive reviews (or many purchases at all) naturally. They gave you those strange instructions of clicking [this] first, then clicking [their product] to make your selection of their product look more organic to the algorithm. You pay for it in full on Amazon, then are reimbursed via PayPal (which Amazon famously doesn‚Äôt use) to hide the transaction. If you don‚Äôt like the product, they do the return on Amazon to make them look like good, true-to-their-word sellers to the algorithm. But most people will just take the PayPal refund and hand over the 5 star review. Here‚Äôs an excellent [article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/her-amazon-purchases-are-real-the-reviews-are-fake) describing in-depth how this process works. One should never trust an Amazon (or other merchant's) review - carefully research the products they purchase instead. Of course, there‚Äôs always the chance that an Amazon Review scam is just a scam and they‚Äôll just take your money and run.

Sexual attraction affects your sexuality, you probably aren't asexual if you feel sexual attraction, that said, feeling horny does not count as sexual attraction in that sense, and Asexuals can still feel horny, or masturbate, they just don't feel sexual attraction towards people. Plus, I'm pretty sure there is even a variant of Spiromantic for asexuals, so you may not even be disqualified from aseexuality if you feel sexual attraction towards someone if it's rare.

Por suerte aun tengo contacto con mis viejos pero la soledad realmente tiene su efecto en mi. Desafortunadamente, no es tan facil ""Hacer"" amigos asi como asi. Simplemente no se como hacerlo, y a menos que tenga una raz√≥n practica simplemente no salgo. La soleda realmente te oxida mal los elementos para socializar.

"TheMotte","t5_vkedk","Turkey officially, petulantly announced that they must be called T√ºrkiye _in English_ by international organisations. I presume Erdoƒüan gets a little power-chubber by insisting Anglophones break our own grammar and vocabulary. Because to be clear: the letter √º does not exist in English orthography, and it's unclear to most native speakers how to pronounce it. There is already a word in English for that country, and it's ""Turkey"".

This narcissistic invocation of the logic of the brand-name (Turkey _owns_ their own name, not you, the speakers of English; much like Coca-Cola can decree how their brand is to be capitalised, Turkey _has a right_ to refresh its brand with a cool new unpronounceable taste) is not √ºniq√ºe to Turkey. The same insecure small-dick energy can be found in people who give their kids common names with stupid spellings (to the stupid, all complexity is inscrutable; the English pronunciation of Ralph is no less unreasonable than substituting the letter y in a name like Brandyn, etc.), or indeed teenagers who insist they should henceforth be called ""Snake"" or ""Dragon"".

Tragically, my own country did the exact same thing in the early 20th century, for the exact same ""big little man"" reasons. Ireland insisted on being called ""Eire"" (the Irish-language name for the country) _in English_ for a couple of decades after getting independence. Thankfully, national levels of taste and self-awareness rose enough for us to ditch this at the tail end of the 1940s. Nowadays, fossilising an ancient and forgotten bit of mockery, the only people in the world who ever still refer to Ireland as ""Eire"" are... the English. And I have to concede, it's a pretty perfect (if unaware) bit of mockery on their part; like calling the same teenager ""Snake"", with a straight face, two decades later at a chance reunion.",1656633659

"WinStupidPrizes","t5_3k2t0","Only partially. The earth's speed is not the same everywhere along the globe. The earth is rotating about its axis, so the further you are from the axis, the faster it goes. So for example if you move from the poles (close to the axis) towards the equator (far away from the axis) the earth accelerates underneath you. If you're stuck to the ground in your vehicle, so like a car, this effect doesn't do anything noticeable because the direct contact with the earth will drag you along. When you're flying, this direct contact isn't there, so there's a noticeable effect of the earth accelerating (or decelerating depending on the direction) underneath you. That is called the coriolis effect. So unless you fly perfectly perpendicular to the earth's axis of rotation, the earth is always accelerating / decelerating relative to you when you are flying forwards.",1656633659

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I am from a developing country. Our parents started trade unions that headed the fight for independence. If you want higher wages, better standards of living, comfortable life you need allies.

This means instead of antagonizing your customers; you talk about issues and win them into the fight with you. You help them understand that this fight is not just about you but is also about the freedoms of the children they bring to the restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, entertainment parks. Instead of fighting as a small group of servers, it‚Äôs you fighting as a subset of workers.

This fight is not new. Sadly, the lessons of the past seem to have been lost. Or the message has been distorted. 

We are all part of the 99% of humans who are not filthy rich. But we are so busy fighting for beans we don‚Äôt see that a hundred people hold more wealth than whole continents. 

You are so seething mad at a poor mother trying to treat her child, yet I heard one man made 50 billion and paid no taxes. 

When we stop feeling empathy for each other; the customer for the exploited worker and the worker for the struggling customer then we would truly have lost the battle.",1656633659

The use of ""girl"" is a shibboleth for misogyny. People who use it to refer to adult women tend, in my experience, to have more regressive views of women. That's one of the reasons it isn't socially acceptable in my circle.

We're back to my original point -- it sounds like the people in your life tolerate a higher baseline of casual misogyny than the people in my life. That baseline varies depending on all kinds of factors. You probably live in a more conservative area than I do.

You also probably aren't seeing it because you are a man. When men IRL call me ""girl"" I usually cringe and bear it, unless I think it's worth the argument. But it does affect how I see them. A man who calls me ""girl"" is not a friend and I do not respect him. In a professional setting, he would get talked to.",1656633660

I‚Äôll probably leave a birthday card at his place setting because that‚Äôs a nice touch and then once midnight hits and we‚Äôre done with the ball drop and Auld Lang Syne, I‚Äôll probably throw a special cocktail at him and get people to cheer for his ‚Äúfirst‚Äù (legal) drink or something like that.",1656633660

True, depends on what your company offers but if one is available it's pretty nice. Tax deduction for contributions, can normally be invested and gains aren't taxed when used for medical expenses. And if you don't use it for medical expenses it essentially turns into a Traditional IRA at age 65.

Republicans have no problem with this. A married Republican senator can get caught smoking crack with a trans prostitute and conservatives will protect him. 

Photos of Al Franken (during his days as an actor) are published showing him pretend to grope a sleeping costar and his fellow liberals demand he resign. His costar went on a bunch of talkshows and said he acted inappropriately and used tongue during kissing scenes. Ok all of that sucks, but none of it was illegal. We should have accepted his apology, told him don't do anything like that again, and moved on. Instead we took a great ally and flushed him down the toilet.

* /r/guns is a sub for talking about guns. It's not a sub to dump gun photos for karma. That's what /r/gunporn is for. That's why we require a descriptive comment ‚Äì to start a conversation. If you're wondering what to write, picture yourself at a party. You just met someone and you want to show them your photo. What do you say to them as you get your phone out?

I idle my bike for 2 minutes max at night (5 mins during daylight hours). The bike is tested at 92db. I live in a lane way with eveyones house very close. 

Never had a complaint. Spoke to neighbours and there are no concerns. 

Either OPs vehicle is louder than stated or his neighbours are shitcunts.",1656633662

If you need to scare one away, make lots of noise, be very loud and make yourself as ""big"" as you can. Be cautious at twilight and dawn. Make noise if you're out at night in the pitch dark.

Sorry for bad grammar and small vocabulary and such. I am not well versed on the English language

Background:  
I(20m) grew up with my aunts and they basically took care of me and adopt me since I was a baby. Aunt A basically is my aunt and mom who financially helped me, Aunt B on the other hand became a mother figure to me that took care of me while I was sick.  


I am now on my 3rd year of 4 years in college. Aunt A and B are great aunts and moms, I couldn't say it less. But problems arise when I opened up to them that I have saved up cash and that I will buy clothes for myself (indoor and outdoor clothes). I still have clothes though but mostly are worn out. I opened up to them also that I want to buy 2 shoes since I only have 5 shoes: first is a newly bought 120$ black shoes for school, second and third are blue Nike jogging shoes that was given to me by Aunt C when I was still in 8th grade high-school, and a red Nike running shoes when I was 10th grade, fourth is a vans bought also by Aunt C, fifth is a worn out Sperry topsider (can not be worn again).  


We are in the mall a week ago. I am with a cousin when we watch a movie on the cinema while my Aunts are there for a haircut and I have some cash left on my wallet that time and decided to ask my aunts (or moms since we are very close like really close) that I will not go home along with them and decided that I will stay for a bit longer and go window shopping, and that I will maybe buy my own clothes with my own money. Aunt A was furious by the looks on her face upon hearing those words. She told me that I have too many clothes and shoes that I don't need and wear and that I can use them.  


I plan to save more money and buy my own clothes without asking for her permission in the future. I have a plan on my mind that I will follow.  


1. Save up money using allowance, etc.
2. Will buy clothes based on quantity instead of quality (thrift store instead of mall)
3. Buy clothes without asking permission

Thrift stores near our place sell good clothes, and I chose this instead of malls since I will be going for quantity and most of the clothes I will buy will be only for indoor. But I get why my aunts wouldn't let me buy clothes since most in shops are pricey and some produce bad smell over the time.

I love my moms, but AITA if I will buy my own clothes with the money I had saved up?

"hockeyplayers","t5_2vs1b","when stickhandling, make sure you're cradling the puck on each touch - start with the basic fronthand to backhand to fronthand etc. motion, and aim to get it as smooth/gentle as possible. start slowly. then learn how to do it with your head up. then increase the speed of it.    
after this, you can learn how to rock the puck from toe to heel and heel to toe. the best stickhandlers often times use circular movements with the puck, and they can do a lot of it with their head up.   
  
once you've become fairly competent at stickhandling with your head up and dekeing people out, start trying to pass the puck underneath people's sticks/blade - the gap between the heel of their blade and their skates. in my opinion, I feel like this tip is a natural step from getting good at stickhandling with your head up.  

important notes:  
- learn how to do all of this with only rolling your top hand wrist. when actively stickhandling/cradling/toedraging, let your bottom hand have a loose grip, allowing the stick to swivel inside of your hand (unless you're shooting the puck, your bottom hand should have a loose grip most of the time). this means that your top hand, wrist and arm will need more muscle.  
- your default stickhandling position, your top hand should be a little extended from your body/torso. if you do the manly bicep flex and turn it upside down, this should be the approximate position of your top hand. it will allow for more circular motion with the puck since your top hand won't be cramped/crowded by your torso.  
- you never want a 'choppy/violent' motion when stickhandling.  
- learning how to keep your head up while puck carrying will improve your game drastically.",1656633663

The leak was a dirty move to put pressure on the player to sign and as it stood he did miss a few preseason games or start of camp or something like that. Fans were worried he might hold out for a long time but that leak pressured him to sign.

I don't know who leaked it but the team culture problem didn't brew overnight. The Benning regime screwed their players on a pretty consistent basis whenever it suited their needs for leverage.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","That's what I'm talking about, they didn't try to ruin an entire holiday. They were not empathic to their stepsister in that situation, situations that are - granted -  not an isolated incident. 

But you address one situation at a time, extrapolating that to an entire vacation is in itself an escalation. (And it's - in part - that escalation that caused the backlash afterwards by the girls and their mom).

That's the difference in what possible examples I put forth (ofcourse being an outsider, there would be different consequences that might work better). 
A very direct cause and effect, but also a limited time frame, after which there needs to be room for recovery and returning to the normal business of the day, whilst not forgetting that lesson and providing the chance for them to make amends.

By bringing them back and then continuing the holiday without them the timeframe was very long and the recovery and making amends (doubt that's an apt translation for the Dutch term I'm thinking of but close enough) just wasn't there. 

Yes, consequences are punishments, I'm not saying they aren't. But there are differences, as for instance the ones described above. 

Another big difference is you crack down on intolerable behaviours, not intolerable people. Since people are not their behaviours. (Even though in these heavy situations we tend to lose sight of that, we ourselves are also human after all.)

Also not saying sending a strong signal that their behaviour was far out of bounds wasn't warranted, I'm trying to answer the question posed by the dad, as backed by scientific research. 

As far as the last paragraph goes, I feel I'm missing the point you're trying to make. Ofcourse I'm agreeing to what you wrote down, since it's part of the point I was making.

2. In general they have one PPV every month. The rest are house shows that will get uploaded to Stardom world. Sometimes one a week, sometimes two and sometimes even three. 

3. im not fully caught up but I think Natsupoi and Tam Nakano are still feuding, that‚Äôs a great feud. Also there is PPV in like 10 days i think and their biggest tournament the ‚Äû5 Star Grand Prix‚Äú starts at then end of July. Tournaments are the best ways to get into a new promotion.

I just started watching Stardom half a year ago and I can assure you that you will have a great time learning about all the wrestlers, factions and Stardom itself. If you watch the shows you will easily get into all the characters very quickly.   Have a great time!",1656633666

"TOR","t5_2r36m","Both exit and middle relay IPs are publicly accessible. Even though middle relays don't relay traffic to the internet like an exit relay would, some malware/spam lists lazily group together exit and middle relay IPs together ('This IP is running Tor'). This is usually due to a lack of knowledge/laziness/carelessness on the part of the list maintainer.

This *may* result in your home IP being treated like an exit relay from the perspective of these blacklists even though you are only operating a harmless middle relay. This can mean you may be outright blocked or constantly prompted for CAPTCHAs even if you are not using Tor if a website has a WAF/Firewall/ACL that uses such lists. I've been in this situation before and now I only run bridges on residential connections and keep middle/exit relays with Tor-friendly hosting providers. Bridge IPs are still 'public', but they're not mass-crawlable/listed like other relays, so the exposure and risk is much smaller.

Another general reason is that a person's home Internet connection may not be sufficient to host a relay (unstable connectivity, unstable power, extremely slow, etc.) - VPS/Colocation providers generally have better power and network connections compared to the average residential-type connection.",1656633666

This is also a word I used earlier, so you've definitely seen the word before. However you glossed over it because you didn't know what it meant. Which is what happens when people use specific terminology when it's not required. If someone says ""a pedo just moved into the neighborhood"" people know to protect their children.

"Battletechgame","t5_39c47","The only time I've ever ejected a pilot is when I could not get to extraction.

I can remember two distinct missions. One was the story mission for the Argo. I got on top of a ledge and couldn't get back down when my jump jets were destroyed.

Another was a smash and grab rescue of picking up a guy and extracting him. My heaviest mech was a shadowhawk and it was supposed to be easy. So easy that I picked min salvage and min money for more rep. Darius failed to notice the 18 enemy mechs, (at least 3 of which were heavies) plus some turrets and vehicles. The default commando I just got and hadn't had time to weapon swap became the star of the show.

The commando sprinted ahead and grabbed the guy. But could not turn around or would get cut off by reinforcements. The map was mostly a wide canyon road. The commando had only one choice, forward. Which was this narrow ~2 hex ledge above the road on the far side only wide enough for 1 or 2 mechs. The rest of the lance JJ hopped along the mountains on the other side. They soaked incoming damage from the bigger enemy mechs below them while shooting at the far side ahead of the commando. Clearing out most light mechs blocking the commando's path. Some the commando just ran past. It was too narrow for them to turn around fast enough to get back shots in before I was out of range. That high path lead all the way to extraction.... I thought.

There was a clear path down from the ledge to extraction. Which was on the far side of the road closer to my mountaineers. Except it was too close to the edge of the map and the commando, (the *only* mech without jets) could not get down. So I had to eject. That mission was very memorable. That crazy run'n'gun was the most fun mission ever. I got ~6 kills too. One was even a double kill when a stray shot blew the head off a heavy. Though having to eject for a bullshit reason at the end spoiled the pure beauty of that mission.

So ya. Ejection is only when I cannot complete a mission otherwise.",1656633667

None that are secular

&gt;

No secular reason to consider a fetus alive

No secular reason to value the rights of the fetus over the rights of the mother


&gt;Then the argument is pretty much ‚Äúwhen is life first conceived‚Äù and the only thing that can really be argued there is personal viewpoints. 
&gt;

Which are not secular

&gt;You think life begins at breath, they believe life begins at conception. 

Secular ""life"" includes the rights of personhood (taxes, police protection, family law, etc)

Religious interpretation of life specifically denies the fetus these rights, because theirs is a spiritual definition of ""life""

I say far left, because people use that and other terms interchangeably and progressives are part of that far left. 

Also just to answer the accountability question, all you have to do is look back to 50 years ago. This is when the civil rights movement, the Women's Liberation Movement, and the Stonewall Riots were all gaining momentum and we were on course to make actual changes into the constitution. There was enough fear that there would be a revolution in America that our leaders actually started giving us things we were demanding. Both parties caved to the will of the people. The way people paint history would have you confuse non-violent for non-action. We need leaders who are going to stand up and take action, or they need to get out of the way. We shouldn't be afraid to make our leaders miserable if they are failing to protect our lives. Boohoo! If you wanted to be someone important with no responsibilities, go somewhere else.",1656633667

"BeAmazed","t5_363r3","I mean, it's categorically inefficient. That is just the nature of how energy moves from one system to the next. There are always inefficiencies. Its just making essential nutrients with excess calories. And honestly, it's not producing many more than what you'd get by eating bread. Bread already contains most essential amino acids, and any other amino acids that bread lacks can be found in cow's milk, cabbage, onions, garlic, parsnips or herbs - all of which were available during the Irish potatoes famine, because the Irish potato famine only affected potatoes. 

A woman can also only produce max like 1-2L of milk a day if she was recently pregnant. Considering the size of an Irish family at the time, that is not enough to sustain them with essential nutrients. So IF they only had access to bread then yes, everyone taking a sip of breast milk every day would delay the effects of nutrient deficiencies.

But the way the OP comment is phrased made it seem like this was a common thing, and that's definitely not true. I think it's safe to assume that virtually every single human being on the planet would prefer to eat some boiled cabbage or some onions or some garlic or some herbs or some cow's milk over drinking their mother or wife's breast milk every single day.",1656633670

However i'd say buying things like corleonite for 655 later on is acceptable since grinding it won't really make you gain powder, similar thing to refined mithril and titanium, you will have slightly less mining levels, but losing on like 40-80 fortune because of the low mining level won't be as significant

Any loud noise - stereo, the sound of hair dryers and hand dryers in public bathrooms, windows being wound down in the car while driving, all of it has her clutching her ears, eyes slammed tightly shut, crying about how loud it is. We cover her ears while she drys her hands, don't wind windows down, got rid of our barely-used hair dryers. Anything we can do to make life easier for her.

My sister and our dad also have audio processing disorder, but for them it manifests as words not processing properly so they think we said one thing when we said something completely different, which is easier to accommodate a lot of the time.

As for your food issues OP, that can easily be a sensory processing issue. And if it's not it could be a food intolerance or allergy. I had undiagnosed celiac disease for years, which manifested itself as gagging on foods I liked the taste of, and random vomiting from eating and sometimes just smelling certain foods. Other foods I'm allergic to also caused vomiting after eating it.

"treedibles","t5_2t3z8","I just know the volume of my candy molds and how much gummy solution I need to fill those molds. I know how potent my rosin is from lab testing, so it's pretty easy to figure out the correct dosage with basic math. So I guess this isn't really an answer to your question, but what do you need a website calculator for? For instance I have a mold with 380 cavitys, each cavity holds 1.3 ml of solution. 

380 x 1.3 ml = 494 ml.

So I know I need about 500 ml to fill all my mold cavitys. In this instance I want each candy to have 5mg of THC in them. We will say the rosin I'm using is 80% THC.

380 x 5 = 1900 mg. So that is how much THC I want to add, but my rosin is only 80% thc so what number times 0.8 = 1900? To figure that out we divide 1900 by 0.8

1900/0.8 = 2375 mg

So now I know that I will need to add 2.375 grams of rosin to my gummies solution, totaling around 500 ml and my gummies will be pretty accurately dosed at 5mg per piece of candy.

It worries me a little that you suffered from severe depression as there have been some known cases where people that were doing fine got into trouble again because of their experiences. I guess it depends on how confident you feel right now and maybe also on the nature of the cause(s) behind your depression.

"UKPersonalFinance","t5_2wkka","So I work in the industry and the answer is there's no money in it.

I bought my first houses 6 years ago which earn well and I'm currently buying another which I think I'm overpaying on by ¬£5-¬£10k given the recent market dip. I manage myself and do all renovations and repairs myself too. 

I mainly buy old commercial buildings which I can convert into flats or houses for HMOs. The house I'm buying is tenanted, I won't evict them but will convert to an HMO once they leave. There's a bit more money in HMOs but with interest rate rises and energy the margins are getting tighter. In all honesty I have no idea how new investors are making money in the standard BTL market other than the long game. Whilst I think the market is going to drop in the short to medium term I plan to hold for 10-20 years so I'm not too worried whilst ever the mortgage is covered and there's a little left over for additional expenses. When the market drops I'll try and buy more with a better margin and better capital uplift.

I think the key to the industry is having a bread and butter income that allows you to keep investing for the capital growth. Those who depend on an income from property have it because they bought years ago which now allows a decent margin.",1656633672

Based on the fact you're using monitors -- if they're really not loud, I think you may just be noticing the tinnitus.

It's a thin are brains try to ignore if we can stop thinking about it -- but the nature of doing audio work is we tune in to what we hear, which makes you notice it.

"benzorecovery","t5_31r5h","I hear that friend! They get you through the bad times, but sometimes the bad times last a while...

First move would be to drop the alprazolam completely. Substitute it with the same dose of clonazepam. On the low side, say 3mg a day, depending on your tolerance level.

To implement the liquid taper take the steps I outlined above, but you‚Äôll need to use 20ml of water for a 2mg pill. That will make the concentration 0.1mg per ml. Don‚Äôt forget to shake well before use. Keep refrigerated. 

You could try a cut of 0.1mg (1ml liquid) per week and see how you get on. Make sure you write down your schedule and doses. If you find withdrawal symptoms appear when you cut you could shift the cut date to make it so your worst symptoms are at the weekend or a time when you are less stressed and can practice self care. 

Just to be clear I‚Äôm not a doctor although I have some training in medicine and personal experience with multi substance abuse and withdrawal. 

Good luck. Life will be better without the benzo fog.

If things are very far apart I would probably just get a car, but I guess I just assumed that since it‚Äôs smaller that things would be in walking distance.

Luckily I live next to the downtown area where all the shopping centers are so everything is pretty close in terms of shopping. Everything else though is a 15-30 min drive. I‚Äôm 45 min out from the actual city of LA, but that‚Äôs close enough that my bf and I accidentally drove out there looking for an ice cream shop and didn‚Äôt realize it was taking a little bit to get there until we were about 40 min in lol.",1656633672

At the time, there weren‚Äôt really a lot of open world games and the closest games to open world at the time I experienced were probably Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, and Pok√©mon. When he described Fable it blew my mind and my Grandma and Aunt graciously let me pre order it, too.

I was very hyped and when I got it, I really liked the game. It was probably my first ‚Äúadult‚Äù rpg, but I remember being let down there wasn‚Äôt quite the freedom promised. Still, I have great memories of that game. 2 and 3 never captured the feelings or fun I had with the original.

Then I got Morrowind shortly after and THAT was a game changer. I probably never even did a quest, but I spent hours and hours exploring and using my imagination to immerse myself in the world. Really started my love for open world games.

Still, OG Fable  was a very important game to me and it has a ton of personality",1656633673

"BobsTavern","t5_27vr4u","I like the kaly buff to 2/1. If dragons maintain a nadina minion. They start to become a groundshaker like class. Lower health with high attack. The 2/1 also balances with whelp smuggler (although I‚Äôm sure no one would really keep it around with kaly) but on top of that. Dragons have both a divine shield minion and a shield buster. The new pyrospawn is better now that it‚Äôs just that dragon that pops shields, but overall I don‚Äôt like the mechanic. I like the idea of a cleave though but I don‚Äôt think it should pop the shield before attacking. I also think if dragons are built around battle cries, there should be more units with a battlecry attached. Or give them brann interaction so it‚Äôs every time a battlecry is triggered not minion played. 

Elementals should move lightspawn down and increase the avenge number. It‚Äôs enough to get the ball rolling while not being broken. Djinni to 5 is good, but also should be reworked to ysharaj hero power. Put elementals in hand and then try to summon them. As it stands the golden version is usually not very good as no board space. I think elementals stopped winning as much due to the prevalence of Leeroy and mantid. 

I don‚Äôt feel demons are that weak, I like the direction they moved to with consuming for stat gain. I think there should be a card that whenever they kill a minion and survive they gain some stats permanently, stealing life essence from the target.

Pirates need a shield popper. There are infinite stats but without selfless and baron they tend to trade 1-1 and in Murloc games they get out traded due to the stats. Usually pirates aren‚Äôt end game. They are infinite economy to roll and collect your end game build which i think is poor design. Thematically, maybe pirates get a card that allows you to change the tribe of a minion to pirates. They leave their old life behind! Which opens a lot of weird synergies while enabling wild Eliza builds.",1656633673

Like 5 years ago i joined a band and the singer was obsessed with them in a respectable way- not in the friend logo wristband from hot topic way- and i decided to listen to their discography.  Glad i did! Maybe it‚Äôs that i got into them later and so all their stuff isn‚Äôt yet overplayed to me, but i think it holds up better than most classic punk.

**All posts must include your age in the title** before we can post them on r/Selfies.  This post we didn't see your age in the title so we removed it. The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post** so this post can't be saved.  You can however **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  

Now if you think this is a pain and why do you have to do this, it's because you aren't verified here at r/Selfie.  When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them, and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested. Just see our Wiki on Verification and you'll have spiffy new flair in no time!  https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/verification

Me, Clarence Thomas and Will Smith are all black men but we mostly certainly have vastly different worldviews. 

Coalitions are important for building political power and winning battles, but if the person standing next to you has a completely different set of win conditions in mind...there are gonna be problems.

There's a reason why the right, *globally*, are coalescing around stripping the rights from trans people. It's something they seem to universally agree on and they know some wins will help bolster the confidence of their coalitions.",1656633675

Your post was removed for not following the proper title format. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *[FS/FT/GA/LF] - LOCATION - $PRICE - title*  

Example: [FS] - Location - $42 - Stuff for sale

# **Make sure you include the hyphens**

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

1. Use only LF, FS, FT, GA as tags (looking for, for sale, for trade, give away)

2. Use [] around the tag, so it looks like [FS]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.

3. For multiple tags, only use /'s, so it looks like [FS/FT] or [FT/GA]. Don't use . , \ | - : ; ~ or anything else.

4. If you are posting a discussion or PSA, please use a [PSA] tag at the beginning of the subject.

5. Your location must be included after your tag.

6. Your price must be included after your location. 

* If you are selling multiple items, please use a + after the lowest priced item.  **Example: [FS] - location - $5+ - multiple items**

* If you are giving something away, use the giveaway tag [GA] 

* If you are are posting LF, FT or LF/FT, a price is not required.   **Example: [LF] - location - stuff**

I am an EMDR trained therapist and here‚Äôs the thing - you always tailor resources to the client. I have a couple of clients who can‚Äôt visualize so we use other tools.

"saskatoon","t5_2rbq2","Cultural appropriate are modern and evidence based interventions/treatments. Part of backwards thinking is that cultural solutions aren't modern. 

A lot of the current intervention models are based on the western medicine model. It's very much a nail meets hammer approach, you treat the problem as soon as it pops up with the best treatment you can find. Pain, here's a pill. Addiction, go to treatment. Depression, pills plus therapy. There's a certain holistic and preventive approach that goes into cultural based interventions. 

It's more than that though. A lot of mental health and addiction treatment is based on American treatment models, cultural appropriate are based on the issues that addicts/homeless folk in Saskatchewan face. Having someone who speaks your language, has overcome similiar trauma, and who recognizes your struggles are all strong parts of evidence based best practice. 

On top of that too, outside of medicine, modern solutions are based on cultural or historical concepts. Modern counselling for example is adapted from Greek philosophy. We haven't reinvented the wheel in the past 100 years, we've just adapted it to the modern era.",1656633678

3 maps

4-5 pieces of gear

per mirror DLC. That is all part of the primary endgame activity (chaos chamber) so there is a reason to play it again other than just doing it during playthroughs and farming the few pieces of gear you want from it. Is that low value? The BL3 headhunters were $3 and were a single map, 1 boss, a big chest, and cosmetics. Considering 99% of the time I spend playing Wonderlands is CC, anything that expands on that and gives me more gear to make builds with is a good deal.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA, but here's how you negotiate this particular problem without upsetting your fiance or making her be stubborn about the name on principle just because you don't like it.

""Honey, I think it's very touching that you want to honor [Bob] by naming our kid after him. It shows that he means a lot to you. I just don't want our kid to feel forced to live up to [Bob]'s name, yeah? I've heard stories where kids named after another person get messed up by it because they feel like they can't live up to the memory. So how about this: we name him [Robert] instead, to still honor your friend but to also give our son his own name without the pressure of having to live up to someone else.""

Substitute Bob with the actual name and Robert with a name similar to the actual name (one that you are comfortable naming your son).

Option B is suggesting Bob be the kid's middle name (to honor Bob) and having a different first name, but for the same reasons: so the kid doesn't feel pressured to live up to Bob's legacy.

(Also in case it's not obvious, I'm pretty sure you're not going to get out of naming your kid 'Bob' in some way. It sucks, but that's how it is. Mom signs off on the birth certificate, and since you're marrying her then you're automatically added to it since marriage = assumed paternity. So the best thing you can do for yourself is to not argue about how Bob is a heroin addict and a terrible role model and instead change it to you want your kid to have his own legacy and not live in the shadow of someone else.)",1656633680

"autism","t5_2qhs6","it just sort of feels like everything just feels sort of ""off"" and i get super antsy. like imagine being in a plain white room with nothing interesting and it's super super super quiet and numb and dull and your body is just itching to *feel* something and do something and hear something, and you start feeling uncomfortable in your own body because of it and it sort of feels like you're about to tear apart. that's what it can feel like for me sometimes anyway üòÇ mostly it isnt that bad bc usually i'm able to get good sensory input, and i actually start doing stuff without even thinking, like twiddling my pencil and tapping my feet and touching different materials and making sounds with my mouth or playing with my hair or imagining things. unfortunately that also sometimes includes subconsciously chewing the inside of my mouth or picking my skin off lol. but yea a lot of times it just feels like my body feels wrong physically and just generally bad, and then once i'm doing things that are sensory regulating i feel solid and calm and heavier. for some reason i always feel sort of light when i'm not getting enough sensory input, like gravity is not pushing on me enough, like the opposite of being compressed, or like when it's really bad like something is trying to claw its way out almost and comes out in the form of this energy that makes me need to shake my hands or punch something or just go aaaaaaah. lol now that i think about it, all this really is hard to explain and probably doesnt make much sense. but yeah not having good sensory input is like, it can be painful, or it can just feel mildly bad or ""off"", and i feel really antsy a lot of the time. 

the thing is like everyone needs some amount of sensory input or else they start feeling really bad, like sensory deprivation is a torture method, even neurotypical people need an amount of sensory input (and kids especially need it). but the kinds and amounts of sensory input i need are all very specific and not met naturally by most environments which is why i have to customize everything. i'm both sensory seeking and sensory avoiding, which most people are, don't know if i've actually met anyone who is only one (maybe someone out there tho who knows). and my ability to handle bad sensations is actually pretty dependent on me getting enough good sensations. like if i've just had a really great workout, i can handle hearing a motorcycle go by, or putting on jeans. but if i havent had any good sensory input, i'm already on edge, so those things can fling me into a meltdown pretty quick. like imagine that same plain white empty noiseless room, but there's an occasional dripping sink. oh my god i think anyone would lose their mind lol. it's like that.

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","1. Yeah, you don't have to let him sit there. Golden Knight hits faster, though. 
2. Rocket kills Executioner and Sparky because it is a hard counter to them. It doesn't kill Hog because A. That is a stupid trade. and B. Hog will die to the tower if you rocket it. And Sparky isn't a pseudo-win condition, its a good push pressure.
3. Why doesn't Rocket kill E-Golem? It can kill Exe and Sparky.
4. I never said use a vulnerable building. For Hog, you can use Skarmy, and if they Log it, then you can place Cannon. If they lightning it, that means they dropped 12 Elixir (impossible) so then you can literally Fireball the Hog, and still be at an Elixir Advantage. You are so fking dumb tbh.
5. You don't HAVE to use just Troops. That is just you being whiny about your loss. Hog Rider + Ice Golem = 6 Elixir, so P.E.K.K.A isn't unreasonable, as you can get counterpush value. And it is easy to place stuff right. So you either get a positive trade, screw up and lose the Tower, get a counterpush for +1 Elixir, don't have good counters (your fault for having a crap deck), or you go overboard on Elixir. Normal card interactions. You were exaggerating.
6. For the 12 Elixir example above, that means you let them get to 10 Elixir without placing anything. Pressure them with your WC.
7. If you count as those WC's (3M Doesn't count, but we'll do it anyways) you get 7. 9, if you count Mortar and X-Bow.
8. Count the bottom ones, you get 12, or 14 if you don't count Mortar and X-BOW.
9. Don't call me the dumbass when you can't even fucking count you stupid circus clown.
10. There are more non-charging, slow, melee WCs than the others.
11. You can use Skarmy, Cannon, Inferno Tower, Tesla, Rocket, Goblin Drill when placed well, 3M, Ice Spirit + Tombstone.",1656633682

Throw fire on the heart when it ""sneezes"" and spawns more zombies and a feral. Dispose of the feral (dropkick and then execute with Powerhouse or Gunslinging headshots or something). If necessary, back into zombies with your car as it causes virtually no damage... You can even get the feral this way sometimes.

Repeat until the heart is dead. You can also plant remote explosives like C4 ahead of time to detonate as the heart sneezes after you've thrown fire on it... Sometimes this allows you to kill it in 1 cycle.

Best case scenario... Make a Bloater follow you so he pops close to the heart. Detonate the Bloater gas with any fire or explosive... even a road flare. This is a 1 hit kill to the heart, even in Lethal.

Good luck.",1656633682

""The Ever After may not be quite as unknown as they first assumed"" Then what was the point of the Djinn telling them to ""not fall""? It definitely feels like a contrivance and they are still writing on the seat of their pants despite having 2 years for this and already greenlit Volume 10.

""They must overcome some of their toughest challenges yet - the struggle of their own identites""

Stop! I already know this will not be done well at all. Any decent writer would use Volume 6 to Volume 8 to have them tear into themselves and the fact that they ultimately caused the fall of Atlas, the destruction of Mantle and got thousands if not millions killed(screw off, those places are fucking huge, that's millions) due to their actions. But we all know it will be some made up nonsense that will pretend to give them some depth and that's it.

""And whether or not they're equipped to stop Salem""

What the fuck you mean?! You mean they flipped out at Ozpin for that but they just kept going and didn't think of any ways to do it? Yes, I know they shouldn't have a typical way to stop Salem outside of ""Silver Eyes 2"" or some shit but this REALLY should have been done around Season 6 then when they bitched out at Ozpin for ""hiding secrets"" and have themselves a few episodes to actually wonder if they SHOULD continue doing this journey rather than immediately force everyone to Mantle right now.

From what I hear, Airbnb's customer support is pretty bad too. Stories like a host canceling last minute, then they have nowhere to go, and they can't reach a real person at Airbnb to help are the most frequent. You can imagine the outrage in that situation.

If not, stick it back in the dirt or in a pot and care for it. Over time it will probably send out root shoots that become more bulbs.

Bulbs are also pretty forgiving in general, so if you just want to relocate it, you could dig it up and do so, but I'd probably wait till the flowers die off and the seeds are ready to drop (if it makes any).

This is simply one more step in a centuries long genocide, one that we should be fighting with equal vehemence and fervor until every acre of land that once belonged to a tribe is returned to them.

I think I enjoy operating the Fuji cameras more, which is nice when shooting for fun and personal work.

"DCUO","t5_2rzg0","Might has a higher base value than most stats, thus it will retain quite big numbers even when you don't build it. On my prec dps loadout for example, with everything specced into precision and even artifact bonuses giving me around 10% prec, my might is at 90k whereas my prec is just at 70k. I haven't checked how that ratio looks like on my healer, but aside from that it could also just be your artifacts giving you a percentage bonus on might, such as trans or strat card, which further bumps up its high base value. As for dominance on healers, as a general tip, your only source should be OP items(the ones you rank up with resources). It doesn't scale nearly as well as restoration plus the values things like base mods provide are abysmal ontop of that. For all intents and purposes it's a tank and controller stat. 

Also keep in mind values like 100k might and resto are major whale/no-life/day 1 player territory, and not the baseline.

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","Funny how you stated that you know sooooo much more than me, but provided no insight as to anything, except for some random given f√±, a crass attempt at pretending you know more about infinity than philosophers, and you cite you're working with math but can't use an extremely common colloquial synonym for mass division?

All concepts of 0 make just as much sense in their appropriate applications, as provided in my above comment, but you just want to hand-wave away thousands of years of conceptual theory.

&gt;Why would any number over 0 be evenly dividing?

Because of the same reason that infinity is ""a concept and not a number"" according to you.  Because infinite nothings can fit into nothing, but if you're looking at it like ""fots"", then only one can exist so it's 0/0=1, because inherently you cannot have more than one empty set (if there were more inside of the concept to take apart, then it wouldn't be empty and thereby you're not dealing with the empty set).

&gt;But i somehow doubt that you meant fots with your comment (or you watched a few Numberphile videos and suddenly think you understand maths)

Just because you're conceited?  

&gt;(Again, having to explain that to you shows how little formal education (from a university, any textbook, ...) you actually have)

Your formal education has obviously failed you with common conventions.  What's with the ellipsis after a comma? But keep on with that attitude for having passed the first few weeks of your courses, mate.

Funny thing is, set theory is exactly what I was referring to.  I also happened to learn that from reading, which you obviously have not done much of either.  As long as you can regurgitate information, it's close enough to thinking for real ‚Äì right?",1656633685

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","""Freudian slip."" I'm typing on a phone and corrected my error within a minute of writing this, this isn't an argument and it's immature.

""Neither Orthodox Jews or Conservative Jews hold that life begins at conception. Which is the root of your argument; so you using the Hebrew Bible to support that position is antisemitic.""

This is simply incorrect. 

""Both also allow for abortion in cases that ASm does not.""

The Catholic Church allows for abortion if it's the result of surgery saving the life of the mother this is the position of Orthodox Jews, once again you are incorrect.

""But good job using people your church helped genocide as a shield!""

The majority of Christians in Nazi Germany were Lutherans this is another ad hominem attack and once again demonstrates the weakness of your own argument that you have to resort to name calling.

""ASm removed Gregory XIV‚Äôs exception for abortions of unformed fetuses; because unformed fetuses did not have souls. This is one of the bigger parts of the change. So either Gregory XIV was wrong or Pope Pius IX was wrong.""

Gregory didn't make an exception for the sinfulness of early abortion he instituted a lesser punishment for earlier abortions than late abortions after Sixtus made the punishment uniform. How the church punishes the sin and whether or not it is a sin are different questions. The prescribed punishment for a sin is not a matter of dogma. Again ASM did not create doctrine regarding the sinfulness of abortion, it just changed the punishment, now being automatic excommunication regardless of stage of development. Gregory was mistaken because he believed in a theory of gradual ensoulment, that the body was formed over a period of several weeks out of a woman's period blood and a man's seed. But with modern medicine we know gradual ensuolment is not the case, we know that a new being is created at conception with unique DNA. That said abortion was still regarded as a sin whether it was early or late and always has been throughout all of church history.

""A part of tradition, which if properly translated and accurate, contradicts Scripture.""

On what basis do you say that your interpretation is more correct than mine. Either scripture doesn't contradict tradition or scripture is self-contradictory and one should look towards tradition for truth.

""It discredits its relevance to the discussion on the Catholic position on abortion since it didn‚Äôt inform said position. Also the entire Papal structure is based on the Donation of Constantine (and acknowledged post Donation exegesis and historiography) so even if it was inauthentic the Catholic Church has made it clear they‚Äôll still use it.""

But it did inform the Catholic position because the Catholic position that abortion is a sin has not changed from the apostolic age. Again you have not addressed the other sources in the tradition that I cite. And no the papal structure is not based on the donation of Constantine the Pope having temporal power over the papal states was. Prior to the alleged donation of Constantine are things like Pope Clement's letter to the church in Corinth where he corrects a church that has fallen into error despite a living apostle being closer to Corinth. Furthermore rejection of papal authority alone doesn't get you to your view because if you just reject people authority but nothing else in the tradition you would be Orthodox who also have the same view on abortion. None of these arguments are arguments against the didache itself being part of tradition or influencing tradition or documenting tradition.

""I said your theology was antisemitic due to the way you were using said Scripture."" 

Oh c'mon as if there is a difference between saying ""you are racist"" and ""your beliefs are racist""


""The punishment for murder is death. The punishment for damaging property is a fine. Augustine talks about this at length.""

Children in the Old testament are the property of their parents and could be killed by them for their disobedience without facing any penalty. Children were murderable in the Old testament that doesn't mean it wasn't murder. Deuteronomy 21:18‚Äì21.

""It does deal with the forming of an organism with life only happening at first breath."" 

But this isn't the formation of a living organism. It's the resurrection of a dead organism having already existed and been given life before.

""This is just dishonest.""

It's interesting how you have cut the other verses you quoted that refer to tendons and skin at the same time. Yes breath came into them so did tendons and skin it is not the breath alone that made them living things or not.

""No I reject shitty eisegesis rooted in supersessionism.""

Once again members of the Jewish community hold this belief it is not rooted in supercessionism.

""As I already have stated you have not countered my three Scripture; tradition can‚Äôt over rule scripture; or especially tradition that is often side by side with slavery apologia and rooted in a society comfortable with marital rape.""

No actually you failed to address my counter arguments to the ones that you cited and you have not countered the scripture that I referenced. Will you also abandon the tradition on the Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, or the Canon of scripture because they are alongside unpleasantries? Also the church has never affirmed these things in any formal way.

""Again not a single one of your passages say life begins at conception. All three of mine say that life begins at first breath."" 

None of your passages say that life begins at breath they talk about life and they talk about breath but they do not link the two. All of mine refer to intimate knowledge of personhood by God prior to birth. Even if life did begin at first breath would you be comfortable murdering a child at 8 months and 3 weeks of fetal development on the grounds that it hasn't breathed yet?",1656633685

Something like Lonzo/PWill/Vooch 4 FRP is a nice haul for the Nets. Likely better than what else is on the market or just as good. Maxi/Thybulle/Harris seems just worse.

Then you trade with the Lakers, get 2 FRP and WB/THT.

The original 13 colonies were, to a reasonable degree, separate entities. The Senate was part of the compromise that brought small states together with the large states - the guarantee that their voice would be heard in at least part of the government.

But later on? States were routinely added in pairs to maintain the pro-slavery and anti-slavery balance in the senate. That's how we get crap like ""North Dakota"" and ""South Dakota"". They weren't split because there were existing independent cultures that happened to split in a perfectly straight horizontal line. They were split to maintain the balance of the Senate on the issue of slavery.

The senate as it exists today is an inherently anti-democratic organization shaped by the desire to maintain slavery. If we as a people actually cared about our democracy we would reform the senate until it was practically unrecognizable.",1656633686

By contrast, more novel forms of anti-racism, such as those espoused by Robin DiAngelo or Ibram Kendi, have an ever-more complex set of language and theory that finds bias almost everywhere and a common humanity almost nowhere.

"neighborsfromhell","t5_2yf7l","I've gotten to the point of not caring if I parent other people's kids if they just let them act like wild animals. I'm fine being an asshole now because people are so inconsiderate that they live around other people. I wasn't like this before up until a recent string of bad neighbors. There is three apartments for a total of 11 kids that the parents send outside in the middle of 12 apartments to scream their heads off for about 10 hours a day. Not a single parent watches all these kids to make sure they aren't screaming, throwing things at people's walls, or thinks to take them to the park to get their energy out. 

One apartment will leave four kids plus sometimes cousins totally alone for hours with no parent home and another works at home and sends three kids outside for her shift as a baby sitting service. There is another couple kids too, but I'm not even sure where they live exactly. After four hours of nonstop screaming I will open my door and tell them that other people live here and the screaming is not necessary. My boyfriend works third shift and has to sleep during the day.This happens everyday and they still don't get the hint not to scream. Other neighbors hate the screaming too, but my boyfriend and I are the only ones willing to tell them to quiet down and it's not ok to scream.  They scream so loud you hear them with the windows shut, a loud floor fan that sounds like a jet engine, and our TV on. The neighbors and us used to enjoy having the windows open on nice days, but that is long gone. We've talked to the parents, but they don't care to parent hence the sending them outside. They even let them litter and throw their snack wrappers, water bottles, and toys where they please. Parents use the guise of kids will be kids to be shitty parents and not take care of their kids now in days.

I totally feel for you OP. Should be able to enjoy peace in your place of living.

There is literally nothing that indicates this. Barbara LITERALLY has 1 ‚Äúhint‚Äù that this could be the case: Ulti zoom.   Ning doesn't even have that. 



The video got revealed at around release, much later  than the closed betas.So, much later than the ‚Äúscrapping‚Äù happened.    From the video format is has, changing ning to ganyu/xiao(since those 2 had similar files during release, especially xiao) would be less than half hour work but they decided to not, even if they had no files, the concept wasn't hard and they spent more for less. Considering the budget they throw on everything around art/cinematic/music  it was clearly not half assed choice like someone might assume

Ning was clearly intended to be there even after she was ""demoted/scrapped"" to 4* which means one and only thing: That video was never made with 5* in mind.

This is what your title should look like:
&gt;    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
&gt;    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**

At least under my legislation rules, eye protection for patients is required so I also offer sunglasses vs clear glasses and I‚Äôve have a few long-term patients admit they choose sunglasses simply because it makes their eyes feel less awkward. 

Your provider(s) are 99% of the time focussed on your teeth and only look at your eyes if we‚Äôre directly talking to you, or if you seem like you‚Äôre in pain. 

Seriously though, do what makes you comfortable. Whether going to the dentist is a good, or meh, or terrible experience for you, the last thing we are worried about is where you‚Äôre looking.

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","Well first, the person you're talking to should be asked if they would ban all efforts to increase the population of hunted animals, such as state run deer farms and land management that does things like clear-cutting forests to give deer greater ability to forage. If hunters were truly only begrudgingly hunting to control a population, surely they would be against those things.

Then, ask them if they would support efforts to temporarily or permanently sterilize individuals rather than kill them. There are several methods of doing this, and it's hard to imagine that the wildlife would prefer to be shot with a bullet and killed over shot with a dart and sterilized.

On the big island of Hawaii, there is an invasive deer population. A proposal to put out food with sterilization drugs was shot down by the hunting groups there. The actual perceived problem of the deer could have been eliminated in one generation of deer. Instead, the hunters made sure the long-term problem persisted so they could ""solve"" it temporarily with violence.

Hunting is just a different form of exploitation

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. Your post should contain more than 35 letters.**

There's been sequels for several anime in the last few years that likely wouldn't normally have happened in the anime-as-advertisement market because of completed source material, already high popularity/merch sales, etc. It'll probably be quite a while longer before we can reliably predict that a series will get additional seasons because of overseas viewership, but for the top-tier series at least it is trending in that direction.",1656633688

So I ask again, you think it‚Äôs a good idea to intentionally have less than $10,000 in your bank account? You think all of these people spending big on weddings instead of making a down payment have a bunch of money in a retirement fund? 


&gt; Telling people that your version of the rules are the only ones that matter and anyone who disagrees with you is irrational is just crazy.

I didn‚Äôt make up the idea that &lt;$10,000 is not enough to weather massive life events. Especially not in the US where healthcare can destroy you and companies can lay you off at a moment‚Äôs notice. I didn‚Äôt make up the fact that over HALF of Americans between 55 and 65 have NOTHING saved for retirement. They‚Äôll be working until they are too feeble and then they‚Äôll be sent off to the cheapest nursing home in town. 

&gt; Not everyone is in the same financial boat that you are.

I‚Äôve made no comment about my own finances. Everything I‚Äôve said is general advice. 

&gt; Not everyone wants to own a house

They want to pay rent until the day they die? By the end of their lives they‚Äôll have spent enough money on rent to have bought a house two or three times over. I know the buying situation is bad *right now* but to suggest *never* buying property‚Ä¶

&gt; doesn't mean that everyone else in the entire world is obligated to obey it as well.

Reddit should start their own country. Think about it: it would have a much higher IQ than most other countries. We could ban tik tok and fortnite, and every computer sold has to come with Minecraft preinstalled. We could also ban emojis too.

We all have very good ideas about society and government, so I think we would be far more efficient. I've seen so many posts with so many good ideas, not to mention our country would be the most progressive and other countries would look to us for direction. We would easily become the next superpower. If everyone left America for a new country, we would easily surpass America.

We could make Keanu our president and have PewDiePie on the flag. It would be the most wholesome country too!

Those are just some ideas I have and my own opinion.

*Fakespot analyzes the reviews authenticity and not the product quality using AI. We look for real reviews that mention product issues such as counterfeits, defects, and bad return policies that fake reviews try to hide from consumers.*

*We give an A-F letter for trustworthiness of reviews. A = very trustworthy reviews, F = highly untrustworthy reviews. We also provide seller ratings to warn you if the seller can be trusted or not.*",1656633689

"Therian","t5_2s72d","Do all Therians have a past life: No, they do not they may just be spiritually connected or just really connected to a certain animal.  
  
How do you figure out what animal(s) you were: Mainly being connected or can relate to an animal a lot.  
  
What exactly is a Therian: A therian who believes by all means except physical they are an animal they are connected to.

"ESObuilds","t5_30no2","I know I commented elsewhere but a heavy armored Templar also reminds me of some new world bruisers. I know I tanked on New World either SB with hammer or GA and Hammer but for a while I was always on the point for wars with two others with the same build. When I came back to ESO I found myself liking my Templar as a PvP fighter. With the right setup any class can beat out people but I run a heavy build of medusa pieces with cyrodiils light and the monster pieces change out for a damage shield a mother ciannit set is great even if you jab at the air the dmg shield will activate. Can I fight 20 people like a tank could, nope, my skill/rotation isn‚Äôt meant for that could I defend a flag with maybe 3-5 yes, and heal myself as well. 

Though I main a DK tank I have better experience being both a support role for my groups and pulling ball groups apart. I do use a bruiser like build with my Necros, though by far the Stam necro is my favorite I use to really enjoy last year my magcro with crimson/harbingers but they nerfed that so far into the ground the sets are pretty much useless. 

Overall any class could be a bruiser, it honestly comes down to your play style and what feels right for you. I‚Äôve seen so much since beta on this game and the changes. 

But again a bruiser build you should try the different classes and see what rotations of abilities you like. Then from there you can make it a bruiser with passives, armor and CP that work for you.",1656633689

His expectations for them are not the same for each, and his response is over the top. A start would be a discussion about having the same household rules for each kid. Bedtime is the similar, and rules the same. So confusing for the 6 year old, and I would jealous too.",1656633689
"TheMajorityReport","t5_36goq","It's a completely mental system. In the UK supreme court judges have to retire at 75, there are 12 of them and they don't all serve for every case, and most importantly politicians aren't elected on the basis of who they will appoint. In fact they're not really even appointed by the prime minister, they're appointed through a commission which has to consult with senior judges and various other people.

I am very politically aware and I literally couldn't name a single member of the UK supreme court and I'm sure that's true of 99%+ of people. We could do a lot better on a lot of areas and our constitution is a joke but this is one bit that's ok.

Ezra Klein had a great podcast with Jamal Greene, author of Where Rights Went Wrong where he talks about a lot of the problems with the US court system. One of the main ones is that the US approach to rights is absolute, whereas in many other countries rights can be balanced against each other.

I also feel like the US is the only country I know of where big ethical and culture war questions are dealt with through the judicial system rather than through legislation. Is there any other country where gay marriage and abortion were legalised through the supreme court?",1656633689

"medicine","t5_2qhff","US DEA regulations completely prohibit refills on Schedule II Controlled Substances.  

Up to five refills are allowed on Schedule III, IV and V Controlled Substances.  There may be state rules that limit those refills further.  For example, in California refills on CIII, CIV, and CV drugs are limited to a maximum of a 120 day supply.  That means just the refills may not exceed a 120 day supply, not counting the initial fill. A 10 day supply may have five refills, but a 30 day supply may only have four refills. 

It is typically allowable to provide a patient with several prescriptions at once for a Schedule II drug.  Most states require that each prescription be marked with a fill date, to prevent all of them from being filled at the same time. This means simply labeling one Rx as ""June"" and another as ""July"" is often enough to comply, although sometimes an actual date is needed, and is probably a good idea anyway. The prescriptions must of course be signed and dated on the date that they are written (no post dating allowed), but the fill date will dictate when they will be filled. This can also be done with eRx prescriptions using the Start Date to label each Rx.  

Not all states allow a 90 day supply for Schedule II Controlled Substances, but if your state does then it may be an option, assuming the patient's insurance will cover it.",1656633690

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","My homie, lemme throw some numbers at you. You've realistically only had about 1 to 4 years of youth where you've been able to do what you want without parents organising it. Your youth has only just begun, and won't end until you let it. I'm 32 and still play games all weekend.

I spent my teen years playing World of Warcraft. If it's what you enjoy then it's meaningful. Don't associate meaning with what's good for society or corporate production. If it gives you peace, then the activity has meaning.

The friendships you make in highschool rarely make it into adulthood. You may keep some, but you'll make solid connections with people outside of the toxic cesspit we call highschool. Online friends are valid friends. Work friends are valid friends.

True adventure doesn't begin until after highschool. When you are free to go and do things like travel and sightsee. Solo travelling is amazing, I spent 2 months backpacking through Europe at 22 and never felt more alive.

You don't need a ""meaningful"" career either. A job serves only to pay your bills and fund your true lifestyle. A lifestyle meant to make YOU happy, to hell with everyone else.

Don't be ashamed of what you do to make you happy. Be proud that you are taking these positive steps to protect your own mental health. Doing that will give you the confidence to socialise a little more without fear of judgement.

Travel and make friends like that. Talk to people online in games or book clubs.

Your youth has only just begun. Nothing has been wasted. You got this homie.",1656633690

To lighten the mood, another question: have you ever watched any TLC medical type dramas? Back when I was a kiddo I loved Mystery Diagnosis and Untold Stories of the ER. I caught an ep recently and the acting in USER was amazingly bad. Also, apparently Dr. Pimple Popper has a show? Thoughts on that?

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","&gt;Russia was not prepared to sit by and suffer the death by a thousand tiny cuts, that so many other countries and cultures have accepted as they‚Äôve slowly seen the erosion of their culture and sovereignty. 

Well, making sure that Ukraine isn't US friendly doesn't really accomplish that. What is Russia doing to provide for this ""non managerial"" culture? It's merely managing one old fashioned culture.

&gt;China, India, Pakistan, Georgia, Serbia, UAE, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, to name some noteworthy cases, at the time of writing, have declined to join the pile-on.

Oh, he's describing the BRIC nations. Nope. India has a lot of cultural divides. China is busy putting people into reeducation camps and forcing a monoculture. Pakistan has modernism versus retrograde theology. UAE still wants slavery and seems into money. Mexico is just run by a few rich families warring with drug cartels and ignores the concept that spreading the wealth and more education and shared destiny would help them overcome. Brazil is run by a silly man, making life stink. And, I haven't taken the pulse of the others. NONE of this is a collection of like-minded, ""against performative socialization"" whatever. They are just the team trying to compete with the ""multinational conglomerate"" that has the USA as it's bouncer. The main directive of the USA is ""get them to use the US dollar, access to cheap resources and labor."" That is why we have aircraft carriers.

This article was interesting. But, I think this writer is trying to give a narrative to something that isn't really the driving force. This ""be nice to each other Human Resources"" crap is just something that happened in-between the real machinations. And -- it's a hell of a lot more of a rosy picture than what is going on with the Putin and Oligarchy alliance in the USA. What they want to do is to sell this concept of ""liberty"" and balkanize the USA while others want to loot during the chaos. It sounds good to people who think their culture is under threat, but they want something more intellectual to point to. I get it; a lot of these liberal groups are annoying. However, it's not nearly like what it was for minorities who got lynched -- so, don't be a baby about it fellow white dudes. This is NOT a struggle to endure. We've got a bigger struggle with people feeling alienated and being angry all day long while at the same time, feeling like they don't have power. It's an explosive mix that can turn ugly. People who can be pointed at a target, given some semblance of a cause, and do damage.

My opinion is, these ""managerial elites"" are not setting the secret agenda. These nations are NOT driven by Human Resources. It's darker than that. This is just the annoying thing that replaced lazy liberalism in the social sphere. The wealth gap is something measurable and real -- and so, bombing Ukraine won't do a damn thing about that -- but, pushing for more digital privacy rights. Pushing for election reform. Pushing for cross-country unionization -- THAT sounds like a plan.

Well. This was fun. Part of the interesting things I used to run across here on WOTB.

"Presidents","t5_2qwlm","Trump is below those 3 because he is by far the most corrupt, the only one to incite an insurrection against our own government (vs just letting it happen), and even worse it was to keep himself in power against the will of the people. In doing so this upended the 220-year tradition of peaceful transfer of power that Washington and Adams so wisely established and was a hallmark of our republic. His effort fortunately failed, but that is without precedent in this country, and I fear could have long-lasting consequences. This isn't even mentioning the fact that he repeatedly downplayed and spread misinformation about the COVID-19 threat, which politicized what should have been a unified response and caused more deaths than would have happened if we had a president who handled it with a basic modicum of seriousness. 

I probably would have ranked Trump somewhere around 30-35 if his presidency had ended in 2019. But those last 365 days sealed it for me.",1656633691

"JobFair","t5_32ex8","I'm very late to answer this, because this is my alt account that I rarely use, but, all of those answers depend on who you work for and what you do.

Some companies are home every weekend, some are home every couple of months. There are drivers to love what they do and drivers who hate the fact that they have to do this. As far as pay, however, if you've been in the game for 10 years and you're not somewhere in the mid to upper middle class income brackets, somebody is robbing you.

The only thing that I can advise is, if you want to go this route, pay very close attention to the economy, because our job depends on it. If you feel like it's a safe bet and the boat will float you for 10 or 15 years, get down, spend a year or two learning everything you can, and then buy a truck. And don't lease it from a trucking company. Actually go out and sign your own lease or buy your own out right. That's when the money starts.

i've grossed over 150 K this year. Definitely didn't take all of that home, but with operating expenses and taxes, but I'm looking at a year where my take-home pay is around 100 K, and this has been an extremely economically weak year. That's all I can say about it",1656633691

I took my cat there last month when I wasn't able to get an appointment with my regular vet for weeks, but I didn't think I needed to go to the emergency vet. When I checked in I was told the approximate waiting time was 3 hours (this was also reflected on their website when I left my house).  I was able to return home to wait until they texted me (they give you a 20-minute window to return). The care was excellent. I think you're best served the earlier you go in the day.

If you want to play Kum Faya Kun with the environment, shift the bloody film city out of the SGNP surrounding zone. Film city covers a larger area and is closer to the core of the SGNP. The shed area has no unique flora, fauna or any animal which depend on that area for survival. While the location where film city is located is a literal travesty on the environment because those are land which still have leopard sighting once in a while, if there was no film city, it would be a full on ecological zone for the leopards.

Also note while the Metro Shed will be of benefit to everyone, the film city is practically of use to only the bollywood. Shift those Bollywood fuckers to Kanjurmarg at their own cost because shifting the shed there is a burden on the tax payer for no tangible fucking return.

While we are at it, we can raze the travesty of Royal Palms, it was the NCP and Congress which allowed a fucking building colony within the very centre of a eco sensitive zone to come up, if the builder didn't run out of cash, he fully intended to build a golf course there. It's on 999 year lease which I honestly want the govt to take back because so far of the 240 acres of land which has been given on lease, only 90 acre has been constructed on. As a refrence point the Metro Shed will only use 70 acre of land. So just just withdraw the royal palm lease and boom you have double the amount of land that the metro would use up and do hardcore eco preservation and replantation project there.

Even the eco argument doesn't make sense because as i pointed out, shifting will cause atleast a 3 year delay with billion of dollars worth of budget over run and will set back the carbon impact which the metro could have saved by 15 years atleast. 
 
See that's how you fucking analyse and find a solution you ecomentalist numbnuts. So far none of you guys have given a valid economical and environmental reason not to put the shed there.",1656633691

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","The black company is one of my favourite audiobook series. Probably what got me into audiobooks in the first place.

The first trilogy is a good and complete story.
And the books are short and sweet.

The storytelling style is very well suited to the audiobook format and the voice actor does a great job especially with the accents of the various characters and not just the narrators voice.

It follows a mercenary company that becomes enlisted with the Villain as she campaigns to restore her ancient empire. The narrator is the physician and analyst (chronicler) of the black company.

All the characters have colourful names and personalities so it's fairly easy to follow once you get pass the first chapter.",1656633693

"PokeInvesting","t5_3epbkb","Not really the reason. The reason is yes it‚Äôs a reprint set BUT it offers nothing interesting. Different holo pattern isn‚Äôt enough to get peoples attention. Legendary Collection is a reprint set and is considered one of the greatest sets of all time. Why‚Äôs that? Because it offered something interesting: never seen before (and never seen again!) firework reverse holos. They also chose better holos for Legendary Collection. Base 2 chose a group of shitty holos. LC had more sets to choose from, but imagine if Base 2 was, say:

- Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise, Mewtwo, Articuno, Moltres, Zapdos (Fossil or Base doesn‚Äôt matter), Aerodactyl, Dragonite, Gengar, Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Snorlax and then like Charmander, Charmeleon, Squirtle, Wartortle, Bulbasaur, and Ivysaur as reprints but holos similar to how LC did Dark Persian and Dark Vaporeon. And then maybe a secret rare Mew that is a holo reprint of the Japanese Fossil Mew that was only released as a promo in English?

Pretty sure the set would be received just a wee bit differently. It‚Äôs all about contents, and the contents of Base Set 2 are just meh. Also everyone hated Base 2 when it was released because it seemed like some cheap knockoff of the sets that were already out (which it basically is). A lot of nostalgia is tied to the early WOTC sets, and base 2 missed the mark. No one was particularly fond of it back then and that hasn‚Äôt changed with time 

Pretty sure the set would be 10000x more popular than it is today.",1656633695

https://contentfac.com/copyright-infringement-penalties-are-scary/

Another one, payout 3k eventually. 

Yes a lawyer will take and win cases like this. A lawyer will take pretty much any case they think they stand a chance of winning. And copyright violation is pretty clear and pretty easy.



Edit- 
Deleted account replied to this informing me the photo in the article was registered and once again calling me stupid. 

My rebuke 

Yup. The photo referenced in the article was registered. I am aware. 

And if OP was more malicious, they could have registered the copyright to the photo, which they legally hold, and then find a suitably predatory lawyer to sue. 

Statuette of limitation on copyright violation is three years. Plenty of time to do so, esp since copyright registration takes 3 month on average. And since filing is $45‚Ä¶well it wouldn‚Äôt be that hard to turn a profit on the lawsuit.",1656633695

Surely there are SOME things that someone else could say about themselves or do that would make you ""harass"" or challenge them publicly, right? 

Assuming your answer is ""yes, I would challenge someone publicly if they expressed X"" 

then I'll simply respond: 

then we agree that it's ok to confront someone. It's just that we disagree about what warrants such confrontation.

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","Non consumerist capitalism is much more like things looked pre federal reserve and before things like the great society.

In a system with hard money where local banks issue their own currency, and where there are less national regulatory schemes, individual localities have much more leverage and much less incentive to act in ways which are destructive long term, and its much more difficult for large entities to raise capital without demonstrating sufficient community benefit or likelihood of making a return on investment that benefits local banks and local citizens.

Modern consumerism is a consequence of Keynesianism and big government spending, not private ownership of capital or free markets.

There are reasons Keynesian economics developed, and there are problems related to local first economies (Keynesianism addresses central bank problems, and central banks are there to solve problems with local stuff like coordination/exchange rates and smaller and more vulnerable risk pools), but consumerism is essentially a deliberate goal of the federal reserve system, as the idea is to get as much money out there into the hands of businesses to make stuff and for people to buy stuff so as to keep employment high.

That is the wrong way to look at things, imo. Low employment is always consequence of some underlying factor, whether it‚Äôs stingy business practices, mismatched skill sets, more incentive to remain unemployed, social issues like depression/opiod abuse, some kind of supply chain shock, a disruptive innovation, whatever. That underlying signal gets muddied if you just throw money at it, and big actors scoop up a lot of the capital the fed throws out at a smaller and smaller set of essentials given how efficient so many areas have gotten.

But consumerism is artificial, deliberate, and tightly related to the federal banking system. It‚Äôs not a natural consequence of free markets.",1656633697

"TerrifyingAsFuck","t5_31d92","&gt;6% of all dogs in the US are pit bulls, Pit Bulls are responsible for about 75% of all dog bites and fatalities.  
&gt;  
&gt;People post these because people need to see the damage these monsters can do. People see ""dog attack"" and think it's like a retriever. You get bit and bruised, maybe some blood if it's really bad.  
&gt;  
&gt;No, when pitbulls snap people lose life and limb. It's not even remotely uncommon for someone who was mauled by pitbulls to have lost multiple limbs. They do not stop.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were bred to maim and kill and that's what they do.I watched a video of a pitbull pull a poodle through a fence and quite literally rip it's head off the poor poodle trapped in the bars.Three pitbulls grabbed another pitbull through a fence, and proceeded to rip it's entire head off and continue mauling the dead body.  
&gt;  
&gt;Huskies like to pull. Collies like to herd. Pyrenees like to guard. We can all admit these things. What do we think the breed bred to kill likes to do? They were bred for gameness. What's that you ask? What makes them dangerous. It means they attack until their target is dead, and ignore any and all pain or distractions. Being gored by a bull, or having its head stomped in, they were bred specifically to ignore that and keep biting. I've seen pitbulls eat a metal bat over the head from a full grown man like it was a fucking gnat. A pitbull attacked a small girl once (I know, very rare story), and she was saved by her father. What did he have to do to get the pitbull to let go? Stab it multiple times in the stomach, which didn't work. Stab it in the neck, which didn't work. It took slitting the animals throat and stabbing it repeatedly for it to let go of the girl. No other dog breed on the planet will do this.  
&gt;  
&gt;These are not fucking pets, they're animals bred to kill.Pitbull attacks look shockingly similar to bear attacks. They have a tendency to go for the face and throat.Pitbulls make up 6% of the dog population and singlehandedly maul more people than every other dog breed on the planet combined.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is misinformation, that pit bulls are good pets. Nanny dogs? Complete and utter shite that is not true in any way shape or form. It's impossible to tell a pitbull apart? Because shelters have lied to people for years, 93% of pits go unadopted at shelters, 99.3% showing aggression.  
&gt;  
&gt;So they rename them, throw away their paperwork showing their bite history, and call it a lab mix or Shepard mix and pawn it off on some poor family who thinks they're getting a loving family dog, that eventually rips their child's face off because poor bubbles got startled by the baby breathing.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have never seen any other breed snap with such little notice. No growling, no barking, nothing. Their tail stops wagging for .3 seconds or they sniff in excitement and then they're ripping someone's arms off (many many occurences) or they're viciously attacking a infant that was in its crib. A pitbull will run across 3 lanes of traffic to latch onto the face of a 8 year old girl for absolutely 0 reason beyond its instincts telling it to do so. You would not fucking believe the rate at which people lose a arm or leg when attacked by Pitbulls. Many victims left with ""nothing but the bone"", if their limb is still attached.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't even get me fucking started on the amount of pitbull owners who lie and go to vets who lie as well, and skirt breed laws. No he's not a pit, see he has floppy black ears he's a lab mix! Mixed with what? Uhhhh..",1656633697

Both the Obamas, and especially Hillary, were vocal about supporting her for politics early on...then not so much since the Oprah interview.

American politics get incrementally more surreal each cycle, so anything is possible, particularly if all she had to do was show up for photos (we know she loves that) and allow her advisors to handle the logistics (we know she doesn't love that.)

The thing is, it kind of looks at this point like she has some very real cognitive and emotional disorders, resulting in irrational thinking and decision-making, coupled with wild control, hostility and cooperation problems.  She spends all her time trying to control a global internet.  These issues are preventing her from getting any work done, or achieving any actual accomplishments.

On the one hand, SHE would never quietly go along...plus the tedium regarding all the work, even for VP, are quite similar to boring Royal duties she LOATHED, all except for the part about charity versus self-promotion, so yeah, that part might be the box-ticking she needs....who knows.

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","&gt;It doesn't matter. That's how statistics work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Because you don't understand how statistics work.

1. A **statistical weight** is an amount given to increase or decrease the importance of an item. We disagree on the importance. I am leaving the data raw. People can make their own conclusions regarding it.
2. This is the complete data from the CDC. This data set is as **representative** as it gets. The data isn't a sample but the entire reported set.
3. Nuclear medicine in your link reference is far beyond the scope.
4. The data doesn't speak of **influence** so there would be no reason to weigh anything regarding influence.

&gt;The data is insufficient. You won't be able to draw conclusions from it because we haven't seen the full effects of the abortion bans yet. The numbers can be weighted but there isn't currently anything to compare the weighted numbers to.

This is what the data suggests right now. You're stating it's impossible to tell how it will be in the future. I agree, I only listed the **present** **data**. You're looking beyond the scope of what I wrote. I'm not cross-analyzing to predict possible outcomes, I giving the raw data.

He made sure many more firefighters died by refusing their repeated requests to upgrade their fucking radios so that they'd actually work in the towers and other suboptimal situations.  He also blatantly corruptly awarded a no bid contract for new radios that didn't work, and they were forced to go back to the failing analog radios they originally had - all of which got people unnecessarily fucking killed.  

He also idiotically overrode the advice of the NYPD and put their command center in the WTC... because there's no way anyone could have known that the towers would be a likely terrorist target.  Not like it was already bombed once less than 10 years prior or anything like that, right!?  Fucking scum.  

Hey, while we're talking about scum and 9/11, everyone would do well to recall that Trump's first public comments just hours after the attack were to muse about how his building was now the tallest in lower Manhattan (which in true Trump fashion was a fucking lie).  While the city was still shut down, and the WTC was still on fire, this piece of shit's only thought was a self-aggrandizing, flat out fucking lie.  

**""It was an amazing phone call. 40 Wall Street actually was the second tallest building in downtown Manhattan and it was, actually before the World Trade Center, the tallest. And when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second tallest and now it's the tallest""**

I've seen people say well what did you expect when a player turns her down about kids and what happens with that. Fair enough, but I wouldn't consider her a great spouse on a personal level then.

I dont understand the decision making from psyonix esports here.

Is this segment for the players? Like do they want to show off their individual personality? Do they hope that people get some sort of emotional attachment by seeing players ""humanized"". Do the players genuinely enjoy media day? Is the segment for the audience?

If its any of those then why not try to be more personalized? Instead of watching each team do basical the same pose, hearing the same music, watching the same cuts, in the same set with the same props.

Honestly though, maybe I'm fully disconnected here and the players or audience enjoy it. However, the amount of players who have come onto Rizzo's stream and said ""oh god I looked stupid"" and the chats ""cringe"" spam might suggest otherwise...

Its pretty harmless at the end of the day at least.",1656633700

Basically these are the trend setters, these are bands laying out what we expect everyone else‚Äôs albums to feel like, and these are the bands people will talk about when they bring up 2018- 2022 deathcore. 

My personal favorite is hands down Sanctum, but it‚Äôs feels very much like an OG release as opposed  to a modern take on deathcore (A Hill To Die Upon is a very close second). I also hold Signs Of The Swarm near and dear to my heart.

On the bright side, the stick isn't actually any more fragile. The plastic is good quality and it's been pre-emptively greased. Its only worse than the original stick in using a potentiometer instead of an optical sensor, but the mechanism alleviates some of the most common ways that can be a problem. The switch to a gamecube stick kills a lot of the potential range and flexibility of that stick as well, and makes it a lot less accurate even in the NSO emulator. You're much better off keeping it as is and not worrying about it.",1656633701

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","There's no perfect cure. Sorry, but it seems like you genuinely desire to change. And that's one step in the right direction. 

I used to have a lot of anger at home because my home life was difficult. I was never good enough. My efforts weren't recognized. My emotional needs weren't met. I got angry at myself and those around me. I used to break things, hurt myself, and go on massive throwing stuff out sprees. And I'd regret it a bit later. For me, decluttering my physical space helped me clear my head.

Now, I don't live at home, but it's been brought to my attention that I get irritated easily.  And I must admit this to be true.

I channel my negative energy/emotions/thoughts through:
1. Working out - lifting heavy, turning emotional pain into physical gain.
2. Walking - gives me time to think and reflect, gets some fresh air.
3. Clean/Organize - cleaning/organizing physical spaces helps me clear my head or mental state.",1656633702

This doctor has sent me for an x-ray, ultrasound, the colonoscopy, has done comprehensive bloodwork (I had the CT done at Urgent care). He told me he's willing to exhaust every possibility with me to figure out what is going on with me and get me back to something that resembles ""normalcy"" (Although if it is IBS I know that that may be harder to do)",1656633702

They have a very differnt body shape compared to most dogs and grow very strange (getting a lot of height untill 1 year then filling it in) the big chest will make them look skinny since it's bigger (like, it goes down way more) then most breeds. This was breed to make the bark louder.

This isn't personal, it's business.
You've spent years studying to be good at a specific task, and if they want your services, then it comes with a price.
If they can't match that, and you already have other interviews lined up, making sure you are polite and professionally excuse yourself, should not be a problem.
If anything this would show them you stick to your guns, you know what you want, and you're not afraid of speaking your thoughts on it. 

The recruiter making a vague post about it is unprofessional. They didn't set the interviewers expectations correctly, and payed the price. They shouldn't try to ""pass the blame"". 

I would suggest just in case you didn't mention it to that recruiter :
Mention to the future recruiters that you have a figure in mind you are looking for, and that you would like to save time if they can't even give a range during the interview. 

This way the recruiter is already aware that even a ballpark Range of the pay is an important thing for the interviewer to mention. 

Good luck in the future interviews and jobs ahead.",1656633707

Domestic wire transfers into your Fidelity account are considered fully collected upon receipt. Bank wire instructions are very specific, which is one way you can tell which deposit method you are using. The instructions you would have needed to provide your bank can be found at the link below.  
  
[Information needed to wire to your Fidelity Account](https://www.fidelity.com/cash-management/information-needed-wire-to-fidelity-account?urltype=https://)  
  
On the other hand, electronic fund transfers (EFTs) are much more common for everyday money movement. Typically EFTs have a collection period of 2-4 business days, but can take up to 6 days. We do allow clients to purchase securities using uncollected deposits ‚Äì subject to security type and daily limit restrictions.   
  
[You can read more on the ways to deposit money to your account here](https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/deposit-money)

If I set it to 5000, I might get 10%, which is 5X as large!  Not to mention all the other parameters (tree depth, learning rate, etc) that need to be adjusted.   For neural nets, it's similar.   Even for some linear models where the only parameter to adjust is the size of the ridge parameter, if the model is data starved, increasing ridge can mean a 2X or more increase in performance.

Unless the Darius player uses their mana carefully, Garen will always regen back while Darius will have to back eventually to restore mana. A lot of high elo Garen players just try to bait n burn Darius' mana down. His Q's ability to cancel of slow effects combined with phase rush makes it almost impossible for a darius to catch up to him without ghost. I'm not saying that Garen will win for sure.

I took a class on addiction and my professor had worked at a rehab. A cocaine addict said cocaine calmed him down, made him focus. That's not what cocaine does. Turns out he was self medicating.

"PrequelMemes","t5_3i60n","I mean. Finn got smoked, and was in a water-oozing bubble suit that he decided (as a former imperial janitor, mind you) to wear while frantically scrambling down the corridors of a major flagship immediately after waking up. 

Rey literally force healed some people who I think she herself stabbed? But but I donno I didn't watch that one. 

Poe survived literally getting blown out of a hangar, through some blast doors, and across a hallway when the Raddus got torpedoed (much like most of us got blown out of love with the franchise when Ryan torpedoed the characters and universe that his enabled his trashpile of a movie to exist). 

Phasma maybe got hit by a lightsaber at some point also?

Smoke somehow couldn't? 

All I know is I read some leaked scripts and, after I thought even a little bit about TFA, and then how Ryan Johnson fucked up #2, I couldn't bring myself to watch the last one. 
Gotta vote with my dollars, you know?

So yea, there's just all kinds of shit that makes me sad for this, and other series, but the lightsaber treatment, their ""shock value and spectacle first"" scenes, and their unwillingness to actually write characters and plots that don't require other characters to suddenly forget that they can force choke, or that Tie Fighters and Imperial walkers exist, or that people somehow are starting to survive ""fatal"" lightsaber wounds.

I donno, the force was best utilized as a way to sort of explain plot armor a little bit, but now it's just full on contrivance and hand-waving. Just like everything else, lightsabers are basically nerfed out of the universe.

Explosions, falls, being cut in half, stabbed, ejected into space, hit with a blaster, crashing a spaceship at full burn, being IN a spaceship that gets blown up, etc etc etc etc etc.",1656633711

Wrong. Completely wrong. Many disasters have happened and many people killed because people engineer things poorly.

That‚Äôs just what the guy is doing. Getting himself by. One car, one person doing this.

What I told you was to think about the actual mechanics of driving with two feet on the wheel, and having to work a brake and an accelerator with your feet, as well.

I also relate to the traits you mentioned such as your eating and multiple special interests you mentioned - I am researching autism often and find it‚Äôs been a constant in my life for a few years. I‚Äôve even been wondering if it‚Äôs a special interest of mine to research autism and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/vedvf5/sometimes_i_think_hmm_maybe_one_day_ill_get_over/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post sums up all my feelings about it right now üòÖ

I wish I could give you advice, but I want to tell you you‚Äôre not alone. It can be hard to see so many autism realisation stories end with a sense of everything clicking, when sometimes it can be a struggle to shift the world views of not just ourselves but our families when it comes to understanding autism and us, and not invalidating our struggles.

Hi /u/prettyclity!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

&gt;####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

&gt;* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

&gt;* Don't post or claim to know someone in the photo unless you can verify permission to post the photo.

&gt;* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

`A.  You are actually the MILF in this photo`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the MILF's permission to post this photo.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

* New and low karma accounts cannot be verified. If you've only been on reddit for a short time, have low karma, and/or you haven't done much NSFW self-posting on reddit, you'll be asked to build up your posting history for a month or so before verifying here. Posting nudes isn't for everyone, and we want you to ""get your feet wet"" by posting in some smaller subs before you jump into the deep end of the pool.

Show as much of your body as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to show your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

-The /r/MILF Mod Team

But by your claim it‚Äôs what started the war, so why wouldn‚Äôt it be instrumental? Unless the war was actually just over slavery and race. 

&gt;The government has been officially against slavery ever since the 13th Amendment was passed, and I have not seen any evidence to show Mason supports slavery. 

Which James Mason are we talking about? James Murray Mason yes? 

&gt;Slavery was abolished in the US, those opposed to this would write against it, many of those were Southerners. 

Yes and my point is that slavery was the cause of the war. 

&gt;The tariff was designed to give the government more money, but Southerners were opposed to it, as it harmed them. It would likely have been forgotten about, but as they seceded, it became a chance to punish that action, as well as finance the war. 

Yes but it did not cause the secession, and had they not seceded it probably wouldn‚Äôt have gone through is my point. 

&gt;The first five websites under the search term ‚ÄúEnd of 1857 Panic‚Äù either say it ended in 1859 or do not say when it ended. 1 (‚Äô59) 2 (‚Äò59) 3 (Unspecified) 4 (Unspecified) 5 (‚Äô59)

"poker","t5_2qhix","Pretty big 3-bet pre.  I'm assuming you're 3-betting bigger because you're 300BB deep, but I would think you would also then want to polarize your range a big more and A5s is a pretty good hand to just flat from the BTN rather than bloating the pot in position.  Remember that, as a general rule, you want stacks to be deeper post flop when you're in position.

As played, I like the 20% c-bet on this board.  This put's most of V's range in a tough spot where it's difficult for him to defend properly.  He will most likely fold too frequently or call too frequently but will almost certainly not respond optimally.  Just be prepared to call a raise because the smaller you size the more often your opponent should raise you in theory.

Turn you can size up a bit more.  That 9d is going to give a lot of his flush draws a pair so it's very doubtful that he would fold those hands now.  As played you bet less than half pot.  I would be sizing up to maybe 60% pot.  You're in position, so you can always check back river if you start to feel like it's too likely you're up against a better Ace.  With 2 flush draws on board though, best to get the value now and forego a bet on the river.  This bet should bet $200-$240 IMO.

River you should also size up.  Again, You're betting less than half pot here.  If V has a very strong Ace he's NEVER folding to a bet of $400 or $450.  So you're just losing a lot of value sizing to $225.  As played, due to using mostly small bets and being somewhat close to the top of your range. There is absolutely no way you can fold here.  If this guy has KdQd and backdoored a flush then that's good for him.  But at this point I would expect him to be raising a lot of hands for value as he probably thinks your less than half pot bet sizes mean that you've been going for thin value (which you mostly have until you ran into a straight on the river).",1656633712

I‚Äôve DEFINITELY worked retail jobs where I‚Äôve heard managers talk and act like that, as if you want to be doing their job in 5 years or honestly care enough about it (most people don‚Äôt, they just need to pay bills or get health insurance like me). 

Though I have met many Manny‚Äôs in customer service‚Ä¶ like at my job now, I work with a unfunny and strange dude like Manny who comes around time to time. And other people find him weird too. There‚Äôs people who never came back after working a week or month, and I‚Äôve had conversations with people who acted like the burger flipper guy (the one who said he had grease in his ears) and I‚Äôve definitely fake laughed like Buffy and felt awkward. 

The scenarios depicted aren‚Äôt ones people have necessarily been in, but they are relatable because there‚Äôs people like that at those jobs. Meanwhile, at many office jobs I‚Äôve worked at, I‚Äôve never worked with anyone who acted or behave like coworkers via retail/customer service. Office jobs are usually more keen on having certain personalities getting hired. And they‚Äôre usually more career driven so you‚Äôre not going to see as much turn over (unless management is shit). And usually when someone in the office is totally abnormal or you can‚Äôt work properly with them management gets involved, and when someone does quit over personality clashing or an issue everyone in the office takes notice. Where as retail/customer service doesn‚Äôt give a shit how weird you are as long as you do the job and get there on time, they‚Äôll hire you on for 100 years even if you‚Äôre very Manny like. That‚Äôs my experience. I find the portrayal to be very realistic.",1656633714

"steelers","t5_2r526","MASON SUCKS!!! LETS TRADE HIM FOR A 5TH ROUND PICK!!! /s

Its rediculous some fans honestly think the Steelers drafted Oladokun to be QB3 as if they are going to go into the season with 2 rookies at QB one of them being practice squad talent level. Hes very obviously being used the same way they used Dobbs the past few seasons to prepare the defense to play against mobile QBs who use RPOs and rollouts.

Also if Mason sucks so bad, how are we getting and draft capital in return for him? The depth chart will very likely remain the same heading into the regular season the same way it did in 2018 when Mason was drafted and Dobbs was QB2. I still expect Kenny to get his chance by week 14 but i dont doubt Mason will get a chance to start if Mitch gets injured or struggles too long in the offense.",1656633714

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Mine is a [REDACTED] who is in the process of taking over a world my PCs were sent to save. It has locked the world away from the gods who might be able to stop it, essentially rendering clerics and paladins into less useful fighters. I can't say too much in case this gets seen by a player (they don't have a clue yet). But they just reached a new phase in the plan, the actual invasion is about to begin. 

My players have been scrounging for clues about an enemy that hasn't even visited this world yet. Obviously they have found nothing directly pointing to the BBEG because it's a complete unknown, until next session... But they've found out alot about the immediate situation. I'm proud of their investigative skills and attention to detail.

I'm actually sorry I can't put more details here at the moment, but I'll be posting more about it when my players know more.",1656633714

The reality is many MANY people with autism are just as functional as anyone else and can go their whole life without people even realizing they're on the spectrum.

"LeopardsAteMyFace","t5_3jp3p","at least capitalism can create a system where there are doctors, nurses, beds, hospitals and machines to save lives. prior to capitalism we had monks with leeches. your choice

why yes indeed, same as with affording food, clothes, cars, houses, free time and so on. the more your work is worth to people on the market, the more money you make which in turn will give you all the other things i mentionned. that's the single fairest system POSSIBLE. being rewarded for good work is widely agreed upon to be the best way of educating children and animals, too. obv this also applies to adults, otherwise we wouldve learnt bs as kids.

i assume you speak of the usa. anytime anyone brings up the single most corrupted country in the world that finances the single largest military in the world which is spread out to such a degree that not even your own government knows how many military installations it has abroad (and yes, this is a fact, the pentagon couldnt answer this question and not primarily for reasons of secrecy) i have to shrug bc i do not care for such corrupt countries just as i dont care for dictatorships of any kind. show me a decent country and you'll peaque my interest.

""we value money more than people""? spoken like a founding father, wanna tell me where you buy your cheap slaves? jokes aside, i dont. maybe you do, as you just admitted, i do value my friends and family, but any drug riddled maniac at the train station? heck no. some of them legit scare me. be nice to me and i'll be nice to you, it's a fairly simple concept, yet people dont understand it these days and feel entitled to everything, even to the love of people.

you do end it on the most important point, though: corruption. the government should have no say in the economy. it's the only way of conquering corruption. the more the government has power over the economy, the more corruption you have. take a look at the soviet union, one of the most powerful countries ever with one of the most government involvement in the economy. what did it result in? reduction of gdp over decades, collapse of the country but most importantly lots and lots of oligarchs, sth the world hasnt seen before at that scale. that is precisely where the usa is headed towards. free market capitalism would be the solution, the more power you give the government the worse it's gonna get, mark my words",1656633715

"DetroitBecomeHuman","t5_3ajb0","In terms of misogyny, I mean more so that the women are treated differently in the fandom than the men are rather than a hatred of women and sort of how women are mostly left out. I mean like why is North treated differently than Gavin and labeled as violent despite the fact we never see her push or pressure Markus into doing anything violent and she only commits violent acts to ensure her safety and to ensure that the revolution will be successful. But Gavin actively pulls out guns on Connor multiple times, and even suggests roughing up Luis Ortiz's android to get a confession out of him, he's clearly trigger happy. People do like detective stories a lot and I agree with that but I still don't get how a blank slate of a character can get and garner so much attention.  


When I say racist, I mean he's prejudiced towards androids and often goes out of his way to humiliate, belittle, and antagonize Connor and uses him as a punching bag. Most of the officers if anything leaves Connor alone, don't act out on their prejudice or dislike, or respect him to a degree. But even then Tina doesn't do anything to stop or discourage his bad behavior and treatment towards Connor and to me, he likes having an audience who won't say anything or will encourage him and his prejudice toward androids. He didn't know androids were sentient but he felt content enough to abuse, humiliate, and otherwise treat this android like crap for no other reason than simply existing. But even then what about the fact that he bullies Hank for being an alcoholic, probably even knowing why he is one? I don't mind characters who are assholes, he plays the role well but I don't understand why the fandom acts like he isn't or that his bad behavior and him being an asshole is cute or something to romanticize.  


I do agree that this stuff will pose a lot of questions and I don't expect people to immediately accept it but I don't think it was a good choice to demonize them and view them as a threat especially if you go the peaceful route. But I don't mind people redeeming him, what I do mind is when people often have him with Connor who he's not hesitant to shoot multiple times and humiliates him and belittles him. What I do mind is people thinking that because he has depth that it means he's not a shitty person who will screw over other people to get his own way or to move forward and act as though he's not privileged. It's the fact that he's treated like a king and has fics written about him even though he treats most of those around him like crap but then some fans have the nerve to say that North is violent and that she's a bitch and mean and she pressures Markus into being violent when they openly like someone who is trigger happy and attempts to murder Connor.

Edit: He is also not worried about his job or shouldn't considering that cops rarely will ever be fired despite great negligence and if they have many compliants and do their jobs correctly. Hank as much as I like him would have been fired if it were any other job and same with Gavin.",1656633715

"ManchesterUnited","t5_2r3io","And potentially also cleanse the dressing room from the stench of some of these guys. In fairness I genuinely think a lot of them came because they saw the ‚Äúwe can help you increase your reach for your clothing brand side hustle‚Äù part of Woodward‚Äôs sales pitch as a way to counterbalance whatever they thought. The thing about getting what people want, is not everyone who gets that remembers they‚Äôre actually there for this other job that slowly but surely they couldn‚Äôt be arsed about. 

So the entire stench of that way of being needs to be turfed. And then they need to bleach the f*ck out of it. 

That‚Äôs the main reason I think we should be ok if this FA youth cup winning side becomes the conveyer belt that feeds the starting 11 for the next couple of seasons.

EA totally screwed up with C&amp;C 4 and then the only C&amp;Cs they released up until the original C&amp;C/RA1 remake was failed browser games and a really bad mobile game. The browser games weren't even just the mechanism to open up a more advanced application. They were so bad.

All they had to do for the browser side is basically make a massively or group multiplayer version of C&amp;C 3 Kane's Revenge Global Conquest (or Firestorm's and Red Alert 2's World Domination), where the strategy layer is played in the browser and the tactical opens up a client to play essentially a C&amp;C 3 skirmish based on the units and points invested in the area.

I'd say what fans want are mostly in this order:

Generals 2

Tiberian Sun Remake or C&amp;C 5 essentially be a Tiberian Sun 2

Red Alert 2 Remake

======

C&amp;C95 and RA1 remake is all well and good but I'm certain it wasn't on the top of the fan's preference lists. EA needs to hire lead game designers that are fans of the franchises they make and let them have a lot of creative control.",1656633718

He did everything the franchise asked him to do, almost takes out the eventual champions on his own after both of his buddies go down, via one of the greatest individual series ever, doesn't complain. Probably ""wins on his own"" if they're healthy. Then Buddy A goes bonkers with conspiracy stuff and doesn't play, and Buddy B fails to rehab, from injury and then demands a trade, leaving KD as the sole person loyal to the team and his contract out of those 3. Never complained all season, never talked crazy about anyone, just showed up and played. Whatever has lead to him asking for a trade now is likely far more,  Kyrie tells him he won't re-sign after the year no matter what, desires to play for the Lakers,  Simmons is meh. Never wanted Nash as coach, but was loyal to him, did his best to protect him.

Watered down to the degree that they knew they didn't have money for light rail now but did want it later, and needed something higher capacity than a bus yesterday.  So, busways to put a BRT on was the mode that ticked all the boxes; reserve the space for high capacity transit now and get some points on the board with BRT.  Its compromise is what makes it the wish.com version of light rail in this application, and honestly makes it a model BRT system for the US.

&gt; The fact remains that ‚Äúhaving a car‚Äù should be the freedom people have, not ‚Äúhaving only one car‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, what you‚Äôre writing sounds good in comparison to other places, but the bar is simply way to low in many countries. For many families, owning ‚Äúonly one car‚Äù is either a massive financial burden or not possible because of disabilities. I personally don‚Äôt trust myself behind a steering wheel with the medication I have to take. If I‚Äôm being told ‚Äúa family needs just one car‚Äù, I clearly wouldn‚Äôt feel welcome. I need to get to work and want to get to nature by public transport. But maybe that‚Äôs just a problem with the ad, not the system. Either way, having only one car isn‚Äôt a good line for a public transport ad.

Well, context is Eugene/Springfield is tightly packed (roughly a quarter the population of Tulsa in one fifth the space, walking from downtown to the edge of town is very easy to do if you have to due to a problem on EmX when it's too late for LTD Bus to be running as an alternative), and surrounded by 100+km of either very rural agribusiness or pristine wilderness in every direction.  Owing to its location in a very rural part of the state, if LTD Bus and EmX don't reach it, and Amtrak can't get you to a connection, you're either going a very long distance, decently off the beaten path well out of the city or both.  If you have no reason to venture out of the immediate area or maybe one of the larger adjacent exurbs half an hour's drive away also served by Lane Transit Bus, then living without a car is entirely possible.  And thousands do just that there.",1656633722

also getting over my finnish learning obsession. if something finnish comes my way, i'll be interested but i'm not seeking it out right now. 

today i found a youtube channel of some japanese guy dissecting and cooking fish and other similar animals. there was one where he skinned and cut up an alligator. half an hour long video and i didn't take my eyes off for a second. usually i tend to be on my phone while watching stuff.

been recently thinking about trying out some abandoned craft as well. i think polymer clay would be a fun one, hopefully my clays are still ok to use..",1656633722

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Assuming you actually have a good experience *in* Bozja, perhaps.

I have not had a good experience in Bozja.

After repeatedly dying and having to go back to camp because no one came to revive me, thus repeatedly losing all the progress I'd made that day, and struggling to find even a single group willing to take me along with them, I've completely sworn off it unless I have an active group of personal friends there to help me.

You will most likely be unsurprised to hear that I never finished any Eureka or Bozja relic weapons, because I had such massively bad experiences in Pagos and the Southern Front that I just said, ""Nope, f@#k this, I have better things to do with my life.""

Which is why I'm really, really dreading whatever the new relic weapon quest is going to be. Because you know 100% for certain it's going to be another goddamn FFXI-like open-world mass-player grind, and it's going to be just as frustrating as both of the previous two were. At least with the Anima weapons, I could grind those just by playing the game, rather than feeling like I have to throw away dozens of hours on a frustrating, sloggy, dull faceroll against a zillion FATEs that will do literally ***nothing*** for me beyond the relic weapon progress.

IF--and this is a BIG if--IF you can get a gaggle of friends to go in with you, then it can actually be interesting. The Lost Actions stuff is kind of neat, and allows for some unusual combinations that can't really be pulled off elsewhere in the game. And, assuming you have Lost Actions that actually help you, some of the Critical Engagements are neat. But I literally haven't even gotten to Castrum Lacus Litore, because it was so goddamn *frustrating* constantly struggling to do things eternally by myself.",1656633722

"Deuxmoi","t5_2rqcm8","Key word there being usually. One of mine started peeing outside the litter box a couple years ago, and right away we rushed her to the vet thinking it was a UTI or kidney problem. Only to be told there's absolutely nothing wrong with her physically. We took her a couple more times since, and it's always the same answer. We've tried every method under the sun to reduce stress, and nothing makes a difference. We even got one of the hella expensive automatic litter boxes because it's literally always clean and that's supposed to help with stress in multi cat households. For a couple months there were no incidents. Then we bought a ramp accessory because the entrance is a bit high and we wanted to make it easier for our senior. Problematic Fav then decided that the ramp was a much better place to pee than actually in the litter. She will literally put the whole front half of her body actually in the box, but leave her back half out so her pee still gets all over the ramp ü•¥ Then she gets in the window to watch me go outside and hose the ramp off.

She's just a piss terrorist, and nothing will ever change that.

(This isn't all that relevant but she peed on the ramp literally as I was reading this thread so I just had to vent for a sec. If there's anyone else here with a piss terrorist, I'd like to form a support group.)",1656633722

"hotas","t5_32txt","You also asked for other space sims. There aren't many.

Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen and Evochron Legacy come to mind.

Other space flight games that are more arcadey:

* Chorus (even if they spell it Chorvs). That game plays better with throttle and stick. No thrusters. It does not seem to play well with the Logitech 3D sticks, but no issues with my Gunfighter Mk.III MCG and Virpil T-50CM3 throttle.

* Rebel Galaxy Outlaw. Also better suited to stick and throttle. Make sure only the controllers you want to use are plugged in or you will have some annoying behaviour for menus. Not every control can be bound in the settings.

* Star Wars Squadron. Also better no HOTAS.

* House of the Dying Sun. HOTAS as well, short, but fun.

* Everspace 2. Still in early access, but it plays well with HOSAS. You can bind everything to your sticks, multiple binds are possible. For example, you can bind the throttle axis to your left hand stick and to the throttle.

* Everspace 1. Binding to HOTAS or HOSAS is finicky, it can be done, it is playable, but the experience is also not amazing. I picked that one up after Everspace 2 for something like 6$, so still got my money's worth.

* Freespace 2 with mods. Still a great game and you have plenty of mods to bring the graphics to modern quality.

EDIT: To keep an eye on for when they release.

* Fall of Nova - landing ships in space with 6 DOF

* In the Black

* Hunternet Starfighter

6 DOF underwater: Aquanox Deep Descent. Was recommended by another member of this sub. Looks interesting, mixed Steam reviews though. It is on sale right now, so should you decide to pick up, you won't lose a lot of $ if you end up not liking it.",1656633725

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It literally is. Since 2018/2019 independents and activists have been calling everyone in the plant based movements to help fight the meat and dairy industries because they are paying everyone in Brussels to support these stupid moves.

This is not new. They are starting to see that it's going to be difficult for people to keep living in their cognitive dissonance with climate change and obviously people who will make the choice to switch to a plant based diet to be more consistent with their views - in this case help the climate/environment cause - will see how easy they can just pick the plant products alternative to the animal products.

[There was the package drama that they had been working on for a long time for instance](https://gfieurope.org/blog/amendment-171-plant-based-dairy-restrictions-threaten-eu-sustainability/).

If you are from the EU, you should follow some of your fellow independent citizens who work in or near Brussels. It's a constant fight to stop lobbies there, I know in France there are some, some scientists who had a change of heart and who used to work for the industries and they dedicated their life to help debunk falsified documents/papers that the lobbies produce.

If you are from France or Germany, I recommend checking ARTE documentaries, there are quite a lot on lobbying around here.

What I'm saying is people like to hide behind god for this because it is powerful and requires no further explanation. Your thoughts might be against your families rules, but those aren't identical with what god says. The true disrespectful thing would be not researching what god wants, or at least my anti-authortarianism says so.

Now I notice this was mostly on a previous comment. Apart from god, some people believe an embryo is a valid human for some reason, so of course they are disgusted. I for example don't share this belief.",1656633728

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","&gt;I said rape being the exception. I wish people would stop using that. 

Why, because it dismantles your entire argument?

&gt;Im speaking to those that use abortion as a selfish tool to avoid the consquences of their actions.  

I see nothing selfish in acknowledging reality and making the best choice that you and your doctors deem necessary.

&gt;And yes when you engage in sex youre opening the door up for a new life. So yes it is a door you open up at will any time you lay down and engage in sex.

Says who? You? Lol

&gt;You arent a child. You know the consequences of sex and what will happen.

Interesting usage of the word ‚Äúwill‚Äù. I‚Äôve been sexually active since I was 16 and have never been pregnant. I‚Äôve had a very active sex life with many different people and have not ever even had a pregnancy scare. When ‚Äúwill‚Äù this consequence happen? 

Plus, going off your logic of ‚Äúallowing‚Äù a foetus into my body, I have every right to remove them from my body too. If they‚Äôre an entirely separate and autonomous person, they‚Äôll be just fine without me. 

If you think that women should lose their human right to bodily autonomy when they‚Äôre pregnant, explain why and back up your claims, don‚Äôt resort to childish slut shaming.",1656633728

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I meant human life in general. Most people agree that taking another life (murder) is wrong. The pro-life people are saying that this protection of life also includes unborn children (fetus).

That‚Äôs where a lot of heated discussion stems from. The definition of life will determine whether if the fetus receives the same protection as a 1 day old infant (if you harm an infant there are legal consequences).

The inconsistencies also pose a problem. E.g. in Virginia you were able to get an abortion up to end of second trimester (~27 weeks). However, in the same state of Virginia, if a pregnant mother gets into a car crash due to a fault of another person and her child miscarries, the person at fault of the crash can be charged for wrongful fetal death. Meaning that the fetus would have legal ‚Äúpersonhood‚Äù and receive the same protection that are granted to all people. The person at fault would be held accountable for the loss of the fetus just as if it were any other occupant of the car.",1656633730

In that case, you haven't had your thyroid checked. You've only had pituitary hormone TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) checked. TSH must be tested along side FT4 and FT3, with blood draw first thing in the morning when TSH is at it's highest daily level during waking hours, for accurate diagnostics. 

""Normal range"" of TSH can have both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. TSH on the high end of ""normal"" combined with thyroid hormones that are too low in range, or are below range, is hypothyroidism. TSH on the low end of ""normal"" combined with thyroid hormones that are high in normal range, or are above range, is hyperthyroidism. You can also have Hashimoto's (autoimmune hypothyroidism) or Grave's Disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism with the above correlating levels. 

Complete thyroid lab tests are: FT4, FT3, TSH, TPO/ab and TG/ab. If one of these tests is left out, you could have undiagnosed thyroid disease brewing.

It's kind of hard to advise because I'm also just learning landscapes. I really like Jocelyn Carmes work so I'd go in that direction but idk if it's what you want or if it's good advice but it's what I'd try.

I think the lantern is weird, it's floating somehow and seems almost like a teleportal or something because it mixes the blue background inside (I think it's pretty cool actually but it's not really clear what the intention was and why it's floating on his back like that). The thing on his shoulders feels round and it's not clear what kind of thing it is. The arcs on the right seem like they should be far in the distance but if you follow the ground from the figure, it seems like they are just tiny.

Another thing might be that the edges are not so defined. The square thing in the middle for example, has kind of soft edges. And there's inconsistent edge sharpness on the buildings. The perspective of the stairs also looks strange to me, and the stairs are not so straight.Also, there's some kind of halo around some objects (like the arc) but it feels like a painting artifact. The buildings (especially on the right) lack definition and details.

I think in general, it could be better if it was cleaner, more confident, the shapes sharper and some parts more detailed I guess. And then you could also use some textures to better sell things like shrubbery and stone.

And I think it would be supercool to have a shallow depth of field with bokeh fireflies. The bokeh-ness of fireflies would increase with the distance, giving it a cool depth effect but then you'd probably lose detail in the buildings (which could save you a lot of work on the background but would also change the focus more to the figure, so that part has to be more engaging).

It could be also pretty cool to make a more van-gogh-y style but I don't know how.",1656633731

‚ÄúWhether smoking marijuana causes lung cancer, as cigarette smoking does, remains an open question.67,70 Marijuana smoke contains carcinogenic combustion products, including about 50% more benzoprene and 75% more benzanthracene (and more phenols, vinyl chlorides, nitrosamines, reactive oxygen species) than cigarette smoke.67 Because of how it is typically smoked (deeper inhale, held for longer), marijuana smoking leads to four times the deposition of tar compared to cigarette smoking.71 However, while a few small, uncontrolled studies have suggested that heavy, regular marijuana smoking could increase risk for respiratory cancers, well-designed population studies have failed to find an increased risk of lung cancer associated with marijuana use.‚Äù

"lostarkgame","t5_34jq7","Kinda depends on how many characters you have and how much you do on each per day, right? You get 30 per chaos dungeon or guardian raid, so 120 per character if you do everything. What you want to buy per week is gonna vary, but in my case I also want T3 + non-tiered stuff (except for the cocktail food item), specifically including all kinds of T3 books. Which by my count is 3635 coins.

So you'd need an average of uh... 17.31 dailies per day to cover it, which means 5 characters and you can skip 2-3 of the dailies per day. If you don't want to do the boss fight but are up for doing the idling quests every day (assuming they give 100 for each which I think is correct?) you would only need to do 7.31 dailies per day. So 2 characters and you could skip sometimes skip a daily (due to how rest bonuses will help); obviously a lot easier if you have more than 2 at that point. Though you'd also need to find 2000 extra coins at some point to cover the one-time trades for the legendary cards and the headbands, so you'd probably want to do the boss a few times anyway. (Oh, and this week's got the lost day, so there's that to consider too.)

tl;dr: you probably need to do idling quests + the boss fight unless you're someone with a lot of alts who really loves doing tons of chaos dungeons and guardians every single day

They stole about $800 in products at each location, which are individually each under the CA felony limit for grand theft, but which aggregated to felony levels

The point here is that everyone jumped on the bandwagon when there are 24 countries who ban it all together and in Europe lot of laws are changing to allow for abortion, which means it is possible for countries to revise abortion laws.

"NUFC","t5_2s6ya","Lots of people seem to to be stressing about us signing a RW.

Howe is obviously a big fan of Fraser. He pushed the wee man straight back into the side and played him at every opportunity.

Add in the fact that Fraser was excellent as he got back to match fitness. People seem to forget that he was nominated in the PL Team of the Month before he got injured.

And Almiron has the raw material for Howe to work with and (further) improve if ASM loses form or fitness and Fraser has to switch to LW.

And Murphy is a hard working and willing backup RW.

Compare this with the striker position. 
If  Wilson gets crocked, having a demon winger is not going to compensate.

Sure, if a modern day Arjen Robben came up for sale at the right price Howe, or any other manager, would want him, but       if we have that sort of big bucks to spend, IMHO, it would be better spent on an out and out goalscorer.

I agree that Richarlison is a better player than Firmino, but your justification is not right. There are hundreds of examples of players not starting over their worse counterparts at national level. Jesus and Richarlison are relatively different styles of players, they play different roles for Brazil, Tite might like one of them more from a personality stance, etc. We can't decide who is better based on national team roles, think about France and what would happen with the way we rate those players.",1656633733

"Rabbits","t5_2riv8","TLDR; probably ear infection? change in antibiotics seem to be what made the difference, but could have also just been time? It's so good to hear your old bun is doing well, too! Providing details in case someone else can benefit.

I also worried Eris had had a stroke. They seem to be rare in bunnies, but yeah, he's an old boy, so... He tested negative for e. cuniculi, all his other bloodwork was normal other than some evidence of inflammation. He is a lop, and has had ear troubles in the past, so I suspected it could well be an ear infection. He didn't really improve at all on the first antibiotic he was on(Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and my vets were also reluctant to keep him on abx for more than a few weeks, even though I had read some bunnies just stay on them basically for life. So that is part of why I agreed to a CT. (and in the meantime got his abx extended because we had to wait a couple weeks.) I was so worried about that whole process, but he handled it really well. 

There was evidence of middle ear infection/disease, but his inner ears looked ok, which was such a relief! He is missing some teeth, (maybe congenital) but nothing was inflamed in his mouth. (he wasn't eating hay or much pellets at that point) He also had a mild heart murmur, and seems like he has some arthritis, so we extended the CT to also look at his neck and chest. Unfortunately, he did have some masses in his lungs. without doing a needle biopsy, there is no way to know if those are tumors or granulomas related to the infection and therefore might also respond to abx. Just keeping my fingers crossed on that, but glad to know to keep a close eye on his breathing.

so, at that point we switched his antibiotic to marbofloxicin(which had to be compounded by a specialty pharmacy) and increased his meloxicam dose. after about two weeks on that is when he was clearly starting to get better. At first I thought I might be imagining it, but our vet was so happy when she saw him for a recheck! So we added another two weeks of the abx, since it seemed to be effective. We'll keep him on the meloxicam for life, but we go back to the vet tomorrow and I suspect she'll want to try discontinuing the marbofloxicin. I'm nervous about that, but it would be nice if his gut could recover and he only needed to be bothered for meds once a day!

Ha! i love the kiddie pool solution. Eris is also on a very understandable litterbox strike and most of his space is covered with puppy pads and faux sheep skin. He had to have a couple butt baths and a sanitary trim, because he wasn't able to get into the right posture to keep himself clean, but that's much better now, too. I had gotten him a box with a very low side I feel like he could likely get in and out now that he is doing better, so I might try reintroducing it and see if we can slowly get back into good habits. If he can't, we will keep doing what we are doing, but it would cut down on the cleaning, which he also dislikes. :)

  
Throughout this whole thing, he kept eating his herbs and greens (and treats...) really well, and the vets kept asking me if I was \*sure\* he was 12, both of which gave me so much hope. I did some supplemental feeding early on, but we both found it pretty stressful. He is eating his pellets and some orchard grass now. (tried \*all\* the hay options...) His poops are getting better. In addition to being way less curled and titled (though his tilt was never super pronounced), he is more active, does a lot less head scanning, or circling when he is moving around his space--though still some. He is more relaxed and often sleeps flopped or stretched out again. He expects many more pets than he used to, and I am happy to oblige. However long he has left, I am so thankful to have had these bonus months and to have him feeling like himself again.",1656633733

True, they do want the players to want the character, but it doesn't mean the player has to want to fuck them. They can just be cute, they could have fun mechanics, an interesting personality/story. Not everything is for unga bunga jerkoff time.

Potassium table salt substitutes are about to get banned as well.

Despite all these measures, I don't believe that the unbombable snowman is truly unbombable. A skilled chemist with a lot of patience could still use nitrogen from the air, refine certain chemicals from ash, aquire sulfide compounds from a wide variety of possible sources and even obtain useful compounds from urine and feces. Once this stuff is processed and purified, you've essentially pulled yourself up by your own bootstraps and can make virtually any type of high explosive you want.

His nurse, told me that he did ask them to let him know which dr I was scheduled with and he did communicate with them what he wanted done. Because he did not want me to have to wait a month. 

I will also say, I felt like it had to be really urgent because the appointment where I found out I had a brain tumor I had scheduled a month out, because his schedule is usually fully booked.

Think of the planets as tools. The more planets you have in a particular house, the more tools you have to work with whatever experiences you have in that house. Try to steer clear of making worst-case scenarios associated with your chart. Think more in terms of best case, especially if you have a lot of planets in the 12H.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","‚ÄúAs a matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, Roe borders on the indefensible. I say this as someone utterly committed to the right to choose, as someone who believes such a right has grounding elsewhere in the Constitution instead of where Roe placed it, and as someone who loved Roe's author like a grandfather. . . . . 
What, exactly, is the problem with Roe? The problem, I believe, is that it has little connection to the Constitutional right it purportedly interpreted. A constitutional right to privacy broad enough to include abortion has no meaningful foundation in constitutional text, history, or precedent. ...
The proof of Roe's failings comes not from the writings of those unsympathetic to women's rights, but from the decision itself and the friends who have tried to sustain it. Justice Blackmun's opinion provides essentially no reasoning in support of its holding. And in the almost 30 years since Roe's announcement, no one has produced a convincing defense of Roe on its own terms.7‚Äù

Also? You pray about it. You ask for God's guidance. You think abut the kinds of things you're looking for in a wife (like common values. One of the big ones for me priorities: God &gt; me &gt; people &gt; work &gt; everything else. So I know to avoid people with another order like workaholics.) 

The main thing is to trust God. He knows what is good for you. He created you, so He knows what you like and what you don't. Your future wife won't be *exactly* what you might dream up for yourself because God did not design marriage to replace Him. And she's still human. However, she will be amazing if she was handpicked by God.

I honestly don't even pray much about this anymore because I'm trusting God and His timing. I feel like I've gotten pretty good at pick up on red flags and noticing when someone's values do not align with mine. So that helps, but nothing beats God's ability to find the right person for me. 

Try not to worry about it. God's timing isn't likely to line up with yours (it certainly didn't line up for me. üòÇ But God was right), but it is always perfect. Whether you realize it now or not. He knows what He's doing. 

Be grateful for where you are now. There is a lot of freedom in singleness. There are a lot of benefits. Enjoy them now because one day, they will be gone and (God willing) you will never get them back.

Make the most of your life. Pray. Trust God. Go outside with other people. That's the best you can do. She'll be worth the wait. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1656633736

What I saw was not ""some"" animation struggles. ""Some"" animation struggles doesn't cause everything to drop to 2fps. Nor does it cause everyone to go off-model so frequently.

What I saw was not an ""interesting take"" on Enterprise. Unless you think ""Shadow the Hedgehog"" (the game) was an example of good writing. Akagi was also completely dumbed down as a character.

I honestly could not tell you what the plot even was, so I wouldn't consider it ""coherent"". Then again, I quit after the bath episode because I just didn't care to see where it was going after that rubbish.

Just because there are things worse than it, doesn't mean that it doesn't deserve to be called out for being trash. That's like saying ""you can't call Star Fox Adventures bad because Sonic '06, Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric, and Superman 64 were worse"". It's a logical fallacy.

Also, just to make you aware, but the word ""objectively"" cannot be used for your opinion. And calling the first AL anime ""fine"" is your opinion.

IDK too much about Saitama, but I'd bet the damage he'd do to Luffy would be less due to the force behind the punch and more about any heat generated through friction, which wasn't present in the Zeus/Adam bout from what I recall.

As for why not all kids in foster care are adopted, there are some issues that come with some of those kids that wouldn't apply to a newborn. You have to be capable and willing to deal with some serious trauma and the effects that it has had on those kids. Another issue you have to consider is that with domestic adoptions you often have the potential for the birth parents to come back and either try to get the kids back, or demand to be a part of their lives. The US gives a lot of rights to birth parents, even horrible ones.

All of that is accepted and dealt with by tons of people each year, but adopting an older kid out of the foster care system is a whole different animal from adopting a newborn child that was going to be aborted.

You could also try a supercav ciws, but I find anti torp-torps tend to work better because of the usual volume constraints on a sub hull.

Mary sad and alone correlates to the next where she's with Granny Goodness and Eclipso, itself a refering to her corruption in *Final Crisis*.

Lex; there's blood on his hands, which may be him feeling responsible for some of the events happening around that time. Maybe J'onn's death? Can't remember what he was up to around then.

In the first, Diana and Superman foreshadows the death of Batman. Himself in the image was a reference to *The Ressurection of Ra's Aal Ghul*, which happened around that time.

KC Supes has the Atom in his hand, who returned in one of the Countdown Arena book, iirc. Black suit Supes is Superboy(man)-Prime.

The crime bible is next to Lex.

Black Racer's broken ski's is the Death if the New Gods.

Lots of stuff in the first to parse out and remember.

I think  the  *Brightest Day* teaser is far more straight forward since all the characters were features in that story.",1656633739

Its creating a panic and hysteria for something that is not a problem. Not to mention any current day parent grew up with internet (so they know how to explain to their kids and what to avoid) + notion that watching horror movies, violent games and whatever else religious Karens were shitting themselves at didnt ruined their lives, so theres no excuse to fall for this kind of zealot bullshit anymore. 

Anyone who still tries to censor the internet with muh children as an excuse to censor everybody else in the process is not just a bad grifter: its a pretty incompetent one.

The worst is when they dont get what they want they will even spread misinfo and pseudo-science that even a 4th grader would debunk because they know pseudo-moralism doesnt work as much nowadays (just like their twitter equivalent may ask for censorship for similar fallacies instead of admitting they are scared of genitalia and want everybody to be as babified as they are using their kids as a mere excuse since they couldnt give two shits, they want it censored to sanitize for themselves and have a way to control and opress others). Even in this thread youll see them appealing to misinfo and tribalism to justify bs censorship as if were back to the 30s or the whole world should be forced in a zealot extremist country because some Karen is angry she didnt get laid and needs to project on everybody else. I miss when they at least were explicitly bible thumping to justify this mess instead of making bad excuses, but bad excuses were always a thing also (religious evangelic zealots would try to grift parents into circuncision of their kids over the excuse it was ""healthier"" when the true reason is that they thought it would take away sinful pleasure in their later lives)",1656633740

#**About Me:**

Want to submit to a real domme? Get a session with me and I will emasculate you, break you down, wrap you around my finger, and turn you into a good little mommy‚Äôs boy. My specialty is VERBAL domination and my expressive face. My services are incredibly personalized and intimate. I will use my words to exploit all of your kinks.

**While I am strictly a domme I am also very fetish friendly. Do not contact me for masturbation or submissive shows. No nudity.**


&amp;nbsp;


**Specialties:**

humilation, blackmail, financial domination, homewrecking, SPH, forced intox, CEI, feminisation/sissification, forced bi, strap-on, chastity, foot domination, erotic hypnosis


**I do not do sensual domination (fucking you/touching you, etc.) nor do I masturbate or perform vanilla (regular old sexy stuff) shows.**

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Services:**

**Have four things ready when you contact me: type of service (kik, rate, audio, etc.), fetishes in the session (generic ‚Äúdominate me‚Äù will not suffice), the length of session, and which of my payment methods you will use.**

&amp;nbsp;



#**Cock Ratings:**

I‚Äôm a size queen and brutally honest ‚Äì don‚Äôt expect any cock worship. All of my rates are clothed and I will use your name if you‚Äôd like. You can send up to five pictures to give me the best view of what you are (or aren‚Äôt) packing. I break down every category that makes or breaks your dick and then give you a final 1/10 rating. There are two options depending how deluxe you want it.

*	**Instant Cock Rate - $30 for 4 minutes**


I film these on my phone (vertical) and send them off to you right away via telegram or a dropbox download link. I don‚Äôt edit these at all, they are spontaneous and simple.

*	**Deluxe Cock Rate - $100 for 8-10 minutes**

I film these on my HD camcorder much like a custom video and will superimpose your dick pics (picture in picture style) so that you will know exactly what I‚Äôm referencing as I break your rating down. Deluxe cock rates are delivered within 24 hours via a Dropbox download link.

#**Kik:** 

Kik id: qcownsyou

Second of all, I'm proud of you for realizing what was happening and not allowing him to reel you back in, especially during a time in which your head isn't clear in the first place.
I'm sorry how he is additionally making things a lot more complicated. You need to take care of yourself, you cannot focus on really any relationship right now, let alone an abusive one that will drain you even further. This will take a lot of time and that's normal. Your body and mind are going through a lot, let them and heal, rest, treat yourself, love yourself. You deserve it and I'd like to think your father would have wanted you to take care of yourself as he took care of you when you were a baby. Truly, you deserve to take care of yourself. That can be a nice walk, buying something cute or just being lazy and eating a family size pizza.
You won't enjoy it with your abuser around. You've made the right decision.
From experience that my abuser, knowing my insecurities and the incredible pain, even self-hatred and guilt I probably will always carry from the death of my father, was willing to go so far as to say that I deserved that he died. 3 days before the anniversary. That was one of the last boundaries I had and she shattered it.
I'm not saying he would go as far, but it seems that some don't have any boundaries. You're right. Don't go back. Love yourself, my dear. You deserve it. I wish you all the best, hugs and love. Take care of yourself.",1656633741

Fascism is basically the successor of national syndicalism since it is heavily inspired by Sorel who also inspired Mussolini. HOWEVER this does not mean Fascism is a leftist ideology. 

George Orwell wrote about this in ""What is Fascism?""

&gt;I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.

It's the same problem when us rightoids accuse anyone of communism (because many don't understand what communism is). I get very annoyed by this tbqh. 

I also hate it when rightoids say Fascism is a leftist ideology (it isn't). But it also isn't conservatism. 

TLDR; Fascism was dead the moment Mussolini was dead. Stop calling people communists/fascists when they aren't communists/fascists.

"Costco","t5_2rsgr","This is a type of Danish white cheese often described as a Danish feta. It's not a true feta, obviously. Feta made only in Greece can be legally called a true feta. Try the Kirkland imported Greek feta. Costco carries a few feta style cheeses such as this one which is very detached from any feta. The French import Valbreso is one example. Tnuva feta which Costco also carries hails from Israel. It's very briney with an intense creaminess that's a little strange. I've seen Bulgarian style feta at Costco before. It's got a middle ground with its brineyness and has a strong sheep's milk flavor. It also isn't a true feta due to regulations, but it's much crumblier and drier than Greek feta. 

Now to answer your question. I have tried this cheese before on sample. It's like a simple farmer's white cheese in a compressed almost feta like form with a mild brineyness and cheesy flavor. It's hard to describe from memory, but it's like panela if panela didn't have a firm, rubber-like quality to it. I suspect it would work well with a salad or sliced in a sandwich. Bit of salt, bit of milky goodness, hint of acidity from the brine.

check the healing tab on my act overlay and, lo and behold, mf had **0hps** on lvl90 warrior. not a single cooldown besides rampart and vengeance(?)

the most terrifying part was that it was their only lvl90 job. they only had like 2 other unlocked at a max of lvl60. oh and they had ilvl580 crafted gear for their left side, minus a lvl86 weapon, then had lvl86 accessories. lvl89 monk had their lvl80 left side on so i was already wary but god damn i got outta there fast.",1656633743

They are marketed as an EV company but produce only hybrids. They are very good at managing their costs so they have great margins and a decent bottom line especially when compared to the other ""EV"" companies. And then there is the problem. Real EV companies spend a lot on R&amp;D and their expenses are higher because the main cost is the battery and all the premium stuff like suspension that they need to spend on because the cars tend to be heavier, the brakes tend to be bigger as well. Even when you consider EV players who have PHEV and China BYD and Geely are better investments than Li. They have both PHEV and BEVs on the road and they are lightyears ahead in tech.  


Grizzly's attack on NIO is completely fabricated with no truth, JPMorgan released a memo countering all the BS they tried to spew. Grizzly claimed the battery leasing company was front loading NIO with 7 years of leasing revenue but what it is like with all leasing companies they are buying the underlying asset which in this case is the battery and it equates to about 7 years as the break even point.",1656633743

Malenia's moveset for the most part isn't that bad either, but her OP moves give her a huge edge. And even though her standard attacks aren't that bad, the amount of freedom she has in chaining them together in different ways for as long as she wants, gives her more variety than the Black Knives have. And that means you have to be more attentive.

Even when it comes to Malenia's weaknesses, like low poise, I'm pretty sure Alecto's not much better off.",1656633744

While AC has some really powerfull tech, I feel like the sheer quanity of what you described makes me think AC just doesnt have the defencive or offencive power to win this with technology alone. Even if they send out Rensa who is a cyborg wich can replicate the power of Accelerator, I doubt she will be able to deflect ALL the attacks

AC can blow up the planet if they are desperate, but idk if this will mean stalemate or nah?

&amp;#x200B;

For Round 3

Accelerator doesnt really have a problem with magic. He had some problems with Aeon of Horus magic (wich is basically a special version of magic used by Aliester and some other characters wich is better then all the other magic), but it was long ago.

This post specifies peak Accel, wich means its Platinum wings Accelerator, who has pretty much full knowledge of magic, won a fight against a nerfed Magic God, can rip souls out of bodyes (he did it to one of the most powerfull characters the Great Demon Coronzon), planted a new ""Tree of Clonoth"" wich is a third tree after Tree of Sepiroth and Tree of Qlipoth, and basically completely changes the laws under wich the world operates (wich is really fukin vague and the actual effects are yet to be seen in the story, but thats how its described) and more.

And yeah thats the problem with Peak Accel. He had 1 appearence currently, in wich he did a bunch of vague af shit. So we cant really know what he can and cant do unless he uses his Platinum wings again at some point.

I dont really see how would he get into the Ascendant Realm thing though. So yeah Oryx wins.",1656633747

^(By: Nick Harkaway | 531 pages | Published: 2008 | Popular Shelves: science-fiction, fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, dystopia)

&gt;The Jorgmund Pipe is the backbone of the world, and it's on fire. Gonzo Lubitsch, professional hero and troubleshooter, is hired to put it out, but there's more to the fire, and the Pipe itself, than meets the eye. The job will take Gonzo and his best friend, our narrator, back to their own beginnings.

    It's the country-fried truck endorsed by a clown!

    Canyonero!
    12 yards long, 2 lanes wide,
    65 tons of American Pride!
    Canyonero! Canyonero!
    Top of the line in utility sports,
    Unexplained fires are a matter for the courts!
    Canyonero! Canyonero! (Yah!)
    She blinds everybody with her super high beams,

"tacticalbarbell","t5_3bvmb","I think there's a lot of grey area here. It's going to come down to your fitness baseline and recovery ability. For some people that would be too much but some can handle it. 

From a very general perspective though, most E sessions (especially in BB) shouldn't be hard and shouldn't eat up a lot of recovery ability either. If you're sticking to the recommended heart rates for E sessions you can probably stack BB with sport training and be fine if you sleep and eat enough, assuming you have a good fitness baseline. It's what comes after BB that I think will be harder to manage. The HIC sessions will definitely require you to spend some of your recovery capital and so will more intensive strength sessions. 

It's hard to say ultimately. There are some examples in the books of guys doing 2-a-days with unit PT in the AM and then TBB in the PM and as he says in the book those guys have earned that recovery ability by building a good base of fitness. I do that myself with unit PT in the AM and my own training after work and I've been largely fine although there are times where I've had to dial it back, like if I'm training for a running event I sometimes need to dial back my strength work to like once every 5 days to accommodate 50+ miles a week on top of unit PT. But we all have to kind of figure out how to live in those grey areas by trail and error. But I can confidently say the human body is capable of a lot more than we often think if we turn off the fear and go for it. 

Maybe that ramble helps. I hope so.

Edit: if you just do one long E session a week then you're getting close to Black Pro. And I think that is a reasonable compromise too. The BJJ sessions will range from E to HIC but probably more on the HIC side when you're rolling. So if you wanna go spartan with programming maybe consider Fighter Bangkok with one E session and no other conditioning because you might get what you need from BJJ.",1656633748

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","My girlfriend is as safe. I locked up all the meds with a padlock. But she has mentioned that if she really wants to commit suicide again, she will do it some other way. 

She has accepted Jesus as her lord and savior. I believe her. I don‚Äôt think she wants hell. She has been so sorry every time she‚Äôs tried to commit suicide but then again, I i worry that she can snap and hurt herself once again or else that pad lock wouldn‚Äôt be there . 

Her abuse is always towards herself. She goes into a isolated place when she has tried to commit suicide to make sure my kids aren‚Äôt preview to it. She freaked out at the possibility of my kids seeing her as she was (in an od state) and begged not to call the cops because of this. She gives my small child so much love and she tries with my pre-teen. He has Asperger‚Äôs and he‚Äôs a little hard to get through. We have our own story with my kids. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs seen. His mom (my ex gf) used and cooked meth with him and my then baby. We hadn‚Äôt been together for years. My small child was the result of a bad decision one night, although I‚Äôm thankful for my baby boy that came form it and took him out of harms way as soon as Cps caught up with her and swabbed her. My oldest  was getting therapy his self but was turned away and sent to some place for autistic kids. I‚Äôm aware aspergers is on this spectrum but this place was horrible. I stopped taking him. He was not fed all day and was left with young kids that were in college. It was doing no good.


Never has she lashed out towards me or my children. That‚Äôs where I draw the line. If my kids ever physically were in danger, I‚Äôd have to end the relationship. 

What I see now is either some odd coincidence of me being mysteriously ill since she‚Äôs been back from what my dr finally admitted ‚Äúmay just be a new disease‚Äù after I‚Äôve been through so many Drs with a constellation of symptoms that doesn‚Äôt make sense. They wanted to put it on my mental health so bad but I finally agreed to go to all the mental health Drs and my psychiatrists literally told me ‚ÄúI think your docs need to get off their ass and find out what the hell is making you sick‚Äù. Between him and all my testing which has confirmed disease of some sort, I‚Äôm lost. I hope I‚Äôm not dying but I accepted I may be. I need to call the priest to my house for confession and Eucharist. It‚Äôs been a few months. He mentioned he gets really busy during Easter and I didn‚Äôt want to bother him anymore. I took up a lot of his time during my gfs last suicide attempt.

"HentaiAndRoleplayy","t5_3zthc3","""Hey Snow! Look here, it's you!"" Said a young man, shouting in a library as a nearby librarian shushed the man along with a few readers. ""S-Sorry..."" The quiet atmosphere slowly returned as ""Snow"" hovered toward the young man who called her. She hovered nearby carrying that cool aura about her. The young man pointed at the picture showing a Froslass picture, taken from a mountain. It appears from the picture the Froslass has detected the photographer and has given them quite the shot. Snow smiled as she moved her hand onto the page and glided across it as if to pat the Froslass in the picture. ""Look here. It says that this hauntingly beautiful Pokemon can be found in the snowy mountains of any region. Though they're more commonly found in the Sinnoh region. These Pokemon were said to have been women who rebirthed into a Froslass after perishing and take men who they find handsome to their icy dens. Never to be seen again.""

The fact sent a chill down his spine thinking about such a silly thing. He then turned to the Froslass and smiled. ""That's a silly thing. You haven't done that to me when we first met. Or am I not handsome to you?"" Said the trainer teasing Snow as her cheeks flushed a light sky blue color as she quickly faced away covering her face. Of course she found her trainer to be handsome but she wouldn't do such a thing. ""Hah I got ya. Still I'm sure it's just an exaggeration. No way Froslass used to that right?"" Said the man as he returned the book back onto the bookcase and went on his way. Froslass shook her head as her species has never done such a thing.

At least not the modern day Froslass. The Froslass of old have done such things. Luring in unfortunate scouts and hikers with her cries and taking them to her den. Believed by the people who knew the hikers to have become ice statues or worse. Sometimes the Froslass would come down to human settlements during terrible blizzards and take advantage of the kind humans generosity and knock on their door. Should they be foolish enough to open would be met with a gust of her frost breath. Freezing a human solid and taking them with her into the mountains.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heyya, hope you enjoyed the intro! I decided to do a little prompt about the Froslass specifically more focusing on it's Dex entries about taking hikers and other people who came across it. Of course we'll be excluding the whole freezing you solid and turning you into an ice statue bit. This'll be a short term RP set in the past. Now who are you? Are you a Scout hiking up a mountain? Maybe a villager taking shelter during a blizzard who foolishly opened for a Froslass?

I'm looking for those who can write 4 pc lines, which I believe is also 8 lines on mobile? Somewhere bit above ~8. If you can write more then great! The RP will take place in pm's. I don't like using chat for rp's as I only use it for messaging and other such things. Now onto kinks and limits. All kinks are optional so feel free to add/remove any.

Kinks: futadom, non-con, anal/vaginal sex, anal/vaginal creampie, blowjob, deepthroating, handjob, thigh job, tit fucking, mild hyper cock (8-14 inches) and throatpie

Limits: death gore/guro, blood, piss/fart/scat, feet/foot kinks, leather/latex suits, pain kinks, diapers, vomit, toiletplay, watersports and anything above my hyper limits.

That's everything! Send me a pm or chat if interested. Any comments asking me to pm/chat you will be ignored. Vague messages that don't tel me what rp you'd like to do will also be ignored.",1656633750

"BoardwalkEmpire","t5_2s0gm","1. Richard - For a minor character in S1, the writers did Jack Huston justice by giving more depth to Richard. Despondent, romantic, hopeful, deadly. Excellent character. 

2. Capone - I love Stephen Graham, and I loved his portrayal of Capone. IMO, his scenes saved S4 for me. Explosive and funny, but serious when needed. 

3. Nucky - Boring answer, but I thought Buscemi‚Äôs role of the protagonist was phonemonal and underrated in the vast sea of HBO characters. His speech to Margaret in S1 when his ex-wife killed herself is some of his best acting to date.

4. Chalky - Until S4, he was #2 for me, but I hated the storyline he got in S4 and didn‚Äôt find S5 to fix any of its errors. Loyal ally to Nucky, and Michael K. Williams nailed the role (rip). 

5. Jimmy - The MOST interesting character from the show. I know Michael Pitt had some behind the scenes drama and Dabney Coleman‚Äôs health issues pretty much changed the outlook of his character, but he stole every scene he was in. The show would have been insanely impactful if Jimmy killed Nucky in the end.

My favorite antagonist was Gyp, but I also have big soft spots for Eddie, Eli, Van Alden, Owen, Rothstein, and Lansky too. So many great characters. 

It‚Äôs a shame that non of the female characters were well written. Margaret was great in S1 and Sally Wheet was cool, but the show didn‚Äôt do its female roles justice.",1656633750

But I do want to offer a critique of something you said in this comment. You say the therapist suggestion includes ""...back away while reassuring them they could reach out."" That could just mean back away from being in communication with him, or at least communication with him about heavy stuff, for the time being. But instead you translated it into ""back away from the relationship."" you took it as your cue to bring up an end to the relationship. I think you reached that point too quickly. You could have backed away and given him time to come around. (Though I understand it would be painful while you waited to find out if he would come around).",1656633750

"Healthygamergg","t5_26y265","i mean, in jungian psychology the process of individuation involves taking all the different architypes and subpersonalities/spirits in your sub-conscious mind and communicating with them and coming to some sort of unified goal. have them all work together instead of waring against each other. maybe you've done something along those lines and all the parts of your psyche are working in harmony together and so in essence it's now just 1 voice. and maybe if you start to repress or deny one of the parts of you, you'll split again into multiple voices like you had before? idk, just throwing out guesses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't know if I've reached a new level of enlightenment or overcome my psychosis.

overcoming psychosis and individuation and enlightenment are all a movement towards the same thing. i'd say psychosis is probably a very low level of consciousness where you're completely fractured and all the different parts of you are doing their own thing and trying to take lead and repress the other parts; while buddhahood/enlightenment is a very high level where you're completely tranquil, silent/peaceful, and present, with no internal noise/friction. individuation moves you in that direction towards enlightenment and away from psychosis. basically in my view, it's the same thing. my guess is that it's a movement in the right direction.

another example can be an elbow, if your elbow is clicking, you feel it, like there's some friction. then there's something wrong with it, but if you don't feel it at all and it makes no noise at all, then it's in perfectly healthy and functional condition. the only concern would be if the reason you found silence is because you tried to ""kill"" parts of yourself, because if you did that it'd probably come back with a desire for vengence. but it sounds like you weren't doing that at all, you were doing the opposite, you were trying to make peace and work in harmony with those parts and fulfill their wants (without overindulgence). and so i'm guessing it's a good thing. i'm not 100% sure what it is that happened. but i'm guessing it's fine, or maybe even good.

or anohter way to put it. if 10 people say the same thing at the same exact time, it might sound like 1 person said 1 thing, or a beautiful harmonization. but if 10 people are saying different things and are arguing, you'd clearly hear 10 different voices and it'll be a little chaotic. if those 10 people sit down at a table and have a meeting where everyone is heard and their needs are met, then they'll all be happy and satisfied and will be on the same page. therefore they'll all say the same thing since they've come to an agreement. i'm guessing all the people in your psyche are probably all happily working together.",1656633750

Maybe shaving half and keeping the rest, or only having the back shaved and having designs cut into it when it gets longer, or maybe cutting it short at first, then shaving it. 

It could also be that you don't have a head for being bald. Some people do not look good without hair and you may be one of them. Maybe he sees that but you're blinded by desire. 

You could also fall asleep with gum in your mouth or do something else to your hair that forces you to cut it off. I'm not sure about how concerned you are with hair health but perming right after bleaching would solve the problem. That's how my friend lost her hair",1656633750

5.	you blamed Trump for lack of trust

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","&gt;this idea that if you love them enough, they will not mistreat you. Life does not work like that.

I know this, but it is both comforting and discouraging to know that I did all I could to be a good boyfriend, but it still wasn't enough. Before this relationship, I never had kissed someone, let alone had sex or anything remotely intimate with a girl. 

&gt;Second, everyone receives love differently. Look up love languages. Some women like compliments, others like gifts, and others like when you do things for them

Maybe that's the problem. I was kind and open about her with these things, and did everything she asked of me. Perhaps I gave too much too easily, and far too soon? We didn't have any useful boundaries and I was giving up on my personal ambitions. When I started to see my decline, that's when I ended it. Perhaps I just did too much for her, and she got bored of it. Should there always be a chase in a relationship? Not toxic chasing for needs to be met, but a playful tension to keep things interesting? I was very quick to make corrections and adjustments  in the name of keeping things simple, comfortable, and easy.",1656633751

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","The voters didn‚Äôt get better at understanding advanced metrics overnight. Westbrook had a historic season that hadn‚Äôt been seen in 45 years prior. Him continuing to do that however made the voters expect him to get a triple double thus taking away the ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù of the whole accomplishment. Jokic wasn‚Äôt set to certain sigma where he was only good at getting a certain accomplishment repeatedly like Westbrook. Again the voters weren‚Äôt educated overnight on how advanced stats work. Westbrook won the MVP because of shock value and by the time the next season rolled around that shock value wore off. It‚Äôs 100% comparable to Ohtani‚Äôs current situation. We aren‚Äôt talking abt how they won their MVPs, we are talking abt the voting system and how both of them are known for a specialty that no one else in the league could do at the time (Russ with his triple doubles and Ohtani with his pitching and hitting).",1656633751

&gt;A confused pigeon has turned up thousands of miles away in the US after getting lost racing back to Tyneside.

&gt;Bob set off from Guernsey in the Channel Islands three weeks ago on the 400-mile (644 km) route to Gateshead, which was supposed to take 10 hours.

&gt;But instead of heading home to Tyneside the four-year-old was found at the home of a puzzled Alabama resident.

&gt;Owner Alan Todd believed Bob took a wrong turn and landed on a ship where he crossed the Atlantic.

&gt;The bird, who is said to be worth more than ¬£1,000, is currently being cared for by an animal shelter in Monroeville, Alabama.

I'm aware that pigeon fanciers are an odd bread, but how can a homing pigeon, that ends up 4000 miles away from home after getting lost, be worth over a grand",1656633752

Anyone can do any kind of activity in their free time. And it is quite common for people to actually immerse themselves in activities/stuff that would be ""related to"" their lower functions, especially during childhood. Another way to find hints about your type would be to look at what you usually struggle with/ignore/forget/dislike the most. Everyone has a very unique personal experience in life, so generalizing functions/types down to very specific activities isn't relevant nor useful when it comes to typing. I personally don't feel close to any of the common conceptions of what my type is, and it did make me doubt multiple times, but as I said, even if I can't confirm it, I believe I'm close to the idea of what my type is.",1656633752

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","I think in a way, what‚Äôs portrayed in the right side of the meme does happen, just not at all in the twisted way they try to show it. Meanwhile the left side isn‚Äôt at all accurate to my experience going to school ‚Äúbefore the woke times‚Äù, even though it tries to portray it as the norm.

When I was in school it was definitely common for a teacher to share some things about themself when making an introduction at the beginning of the year. And no one ever responded like on the right side of the meme, wondering the relevance to the class. It was a teacher‚Äôs introduction at the beginning of the school year, it‚Äôs relevant because they‚Äôre the teacher of that subject and you‚Äôll be spending a good deal of time learning from them.

Aside from this made up concept that teachers should never discussed anything aside from the topic at hand, what‚Äôs the part of the intro from the teacher on the right that I‚Äôm supposed to find offensive? All I can point to is the non-binary part, the rest isn‚Äôt something to get triggered over, especially if it were phrased more normally.

When my teachers introduced themselves, they‚Äôd often say how long they had been teaching, maybe why they got into teaching, maybe what sports team they like, and maybe say something like ‚ÄúI live over in &lt;town&gt; with my wife and I have a 5 year old son‚Äù. It shouldn‚Äôt matter if the person saying that sentence is a woman, it didn‚Äôt suddenly become a groomer sentence because they‚Äôre gay. The right side of the meme tries to make it seem like a weird thing to reveal, as if teachers haven‚Äôt revealed the gender of their spouse for decades.

All that leaves is the pronouns. Given that schools and society at large are making an effort to make trans people feel more accepted, it‚Äôs also not that strange to share pronouns at the beginning of the school year. And even if someone finds it strange, it‚Äôs about as low an impact sentence as it gets. Literally just ‚Äúmy pronouns are she/her‚Äù and then it‚Äôs never needed to be mentioned again the rest of the school year. Was someone just groomed because they heard that sentence? Did society fuckin collapse because a teacher uttered those words, words that have no impact on most students but make trans students feel more comfortable? Or is it just too irrelevant to share how they should be referred to, and every teacher should be required to merely state their name and then begin reciting from the textbook?

So what am I supposed to be terrified about in the right side of the meme? That teachers share a couple sentences about themselves at the start of the school year, as they‚Äôve done for years? That in that intro, the gender of their spouse was revealed, something that‚Äôs also been shared for years? That they shared their pronouns, something that‚Äôs hardly uncommon in large organizations these days, has no impact on most people but makes a group of people feel more comfortable? Or the mention of non-binary, something that doesn‚Äôt even make sense here since the her pronouns aren‚Äôt they/them and wouldn‚Äôt even be said in reality?

I swear this meme is just ‚Äúpronouns scary‚Äù and the right eats it up.",1656633753

However, while it might pain me to see this happens, I also understand that the *""""""idiotic""""""* reasoning SEGA gave is pretty much just basic supply and demand concepts...  I personally have a hard time getting why people call this reasoning *""idiotic""* when clearly, the logic behind it is pretty friggin' sound to me... The higher the demand, the more you supply.

As a business, SEGA simply won't make more outfits of a specific type when only about 10%-15% of the total customer-base is using those outfits and cosmetics, it just doesn't make sense business-wise and would be a waste of money since the return on investment is simply not gonna be there.

Again, **I know** the pain, and it sucks major donkey kong dongs, but the harsh reality of it is... it's simply how Supply and Demand works, doesn't matter how loud we keep screaming, it still won't change until those metrics eventually changes themselves, and sadly, those are consistent across the entire gaming industry...

Because the point it makes about privilege. The comment I originally replied to said a huge chunk of people can't buy homes. How big is this chunk? 

&gt;It, again, goes back to the time when the dollar went further. When people say boomers they're not talking about the average person they're talking about those who have power.

Okay, still talking about my mom, and not the people in the present making $60k/yr

&gt;Idk where you live so maybe that's why you were able to afford a downpayment. Which is awesome. However where I live I make more than most and more than half of it goes to rent alone and I can't work a second job because of external circumstances. Moving is an option if the jobs are there, one can afford to do so, and the environment works for it. 

Not doxxing myself, which makes this hard to talk deeply about. Cost of living is pretty average with the nation. Pre-covid, a 2bed was $1250. Post covid, much harder...

Anyhow, you kind of went sideways with this. I made a statement, that people around me are buying houses at a similar rate to when my mom and that generation. Because of my firsthand experience with people such as myself and those in similar situation as mine are buying houses, I asked a question.

My question, what portion of people, and specifically what groups(generations) can't buy houses. That's an important question, because the original statement makes it sound like 30%+, a drastic number. If that number is closer to 5%, it's a huge difference, and less worrying.",1656633754

We've all upvoted that video a hundred times and it never stops being great.

I used to coach soccer until my daughter advanced to a higher level, and I always made sure I had something for every kid on the team after the game - a slice of pizza, a popsicle, hot chocolate and a donut on cold days.

i had to go to a different country for a funeral, driving in my aunties car with my other auntie in the back, my sister was sitting beside her on the way up. once we had to go home i refused to sit next to my auntie in the back.

she had gotten very drunk after the funeral, going to other peoples hotels to get even more drunk after she had enough. the next morning she had peed from head to toe and didn‚Äôt get a shower afterwards, making her smell really bad. i didn‚Äôt want to sit next to her and she burst out in tears, saying i hated her.

i had always been sarcastic and everyone in my family knows i am, so i didn‚Äôt understand why she was so surprised by this. she kept crying until my other auntie told her to calm down, then telling me to sit next to her.

i ended up sitting next to her, she stank but i put up with it. i didn‚Äôt say a word to her on the way up, getting out at a garage to get away from her smell. my other auntie apologised for siding with her instead of me, i forgave her as she had always been close with me.

after we got back i haven‚Äôt said a word to her since, everyone seems to be on my side but i want to see a perspective outside of the family, AITA?

"tennis","t5_2qiq1","I'd personally say that the better option on the poll would be (that would satisfy everyone):  


*""Prefer it to stay as it distinguishes from the rest of the Slams, however not to be as strict on colour underneath white""* to help the women better. As I understand the argument from women, and think it's better if Wimbledon found a solution to give players a ""duty of care"" for them.  


That way everyone wins.

Gotta remember in Britain we used to care about dress code a lot, even going to some nightclubs you had a particular dress code you had to have before they let you through the doors.

Traditions at Wimbledon are slowly changing anyway, so eventually they may drop it. But for me I kinda prefer this as commercialism kinda takes a backseat to the tennis.",1656633754

But, yes, I have noticed I can be walking outside on one of my safe routes and feeling quite relaxed but then see someone on the path ahead and instantly want to go home. There's always a slight expectation that people are going to do or say something that makes me feel wrong somehow. Like I shouldn't be there.

"GreekMythology","t5_2tm3w","Yes. If I were to give my two cents, I'd also note that before Apollon, the oracular seat was held by the three goddesses in succession, till Phivi/Phoibi gave it to her grandson as a birthday gift. 

Also considering that the name Delphi (most probably) comes from *delphis* (Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜœçœÇ), meaning 'womb,' which in the proper context, usually refers to the great mother (goddess), in the sense that she's bearing the great father, e.g. Hathor and Ra.

This is also in accordance with the hypothesis of Pythia inhaling vapors coming from the chasm beneath the tripod, i.e. coming from Ge, in order to get into the oracular state.

Finally, correct me if I'm wrong, it seems that Apollon is the only (or at least one of the quite few) Olympian(s) who has the feminine features, as being described/depicted as a Ephivos/Ephibos (·ºîœÜŒ∑Œ≤ŒøœÇ), in the sense of being (quite) young, pretty and ""girlish."" In this regard, he's quite the opposite of his twin sister Artemis, whom she has the epithet Arsenomorphos (·ºÄœÅœÉŒµŒΩœåŒºŒøœÅœÜŒøœÇ), meaning 'of masculine form, or look.' 

To wrap it up, in my humble opinion, the association of prophecy with the feminine deities in general, and with the Delphi and Pythia in particular, is not in contradiction with Apollon being the god of prophecy and oracles.",1656633756

I wouldn't mind some stuff like Borreload needing a Dragon monster for it's summon or Baronne a Warrior or Wind, but archetype lock just makes the already good archetypes better while making worse archetypes not able to compete. 

And worse, it can even affect how to make those monsters in their own archetypes, if for example I needed only Rokket monsters to make Borreload, then suddenly Rokket Tracer + Chamber Dragonmaid/Black Dragon Collarserpent couldn't be used for it, and those are cards that tend to go into the same deck. In fact, a lot of really strong boss monsters through the years were irrelevant because even their own archetypes couldn't summon it because of extremely specific summoning requirements. Up until the release of Dragunity Couse, Dragunity had no reliable way to summon Dragunity Barcha due to it needing extremely specific materials (that weren't even archetype locked), so between 2011 and 2019 the card was effective unplayable even though it was supposed to be the ""boss monster"" of Dragunity.",1656633757

HOW IT WORKS:

- 1 song per comment.

- 1 comment per song. If you see multiple comments with the same song, please only upvote one of them.

- Whichever has the most upvotes wins the nomination.

- TPR does some covers, so cover suggestions are an option, but please try to suggest ones TPR might actually try (i.e. from bands they love, or tracks that fit their sound/style).

- Acoustic performances are also an option and count separately to their studio counterpart. Meaning both versions can make the setlist.

- Try to really think about how you would want the show structured. What order of songs would flow well, highs &amp; lows, etc.

- DO NOT DOWNVOTE SUGGESTIONS",1656633757

Thats because 70% of a soy plant is leaves and stems and other fiber that is NOT IDEAL FOR HUMANS TO EAT. Its byproduct that is UPCYCLED. 

And the worlds animals diets are not 70% soy. Statistics are tricky like that. 

Your own sources that make this claim do not actually incorporate the actual percentages of bushels that are used for what, nor whether the soil being farmed is suitable for human grade food (soil is tested before planting btw, and hard climates make the soil unsuitable for human grade crop, so they grow industrial or feed grade based on the quality of it.) 

Next you literally deny the fact that the worlds arable land is extremely limited, and in fact we will need to pasture more as climate change gets worse. We will HAVE to use cows and animals to save ourselves from famine. And to recover soil that has been horribly degraded by artificial fertilizers and pesticides and over-farming.

Diana de Madame is absolutely insufferable. I love a good villain but she's just such a dry dick about it. 

Crystal's family is adorable

I love how Erika is just there to be completely wasted and do nothing else üòÇ

Garcelle and Sutton are everything. I love how they both took big gulps when Momma Madame showed and they both commented on her fucking up Garcelle's name in that bizarre text",1656633757

**Title:** [USA-IL] [H] iPhone 11 Pro Max 64GB - Unlocked [W] PayPal

**Username:** /u/flamethrower128

**Body:**

Hey there, 

Asking Price: **$410** Shipped to anywhere in the USA.

[https://imgur.com/a/izxtEqX](https://imgur.com/a/izxtEqX)

I am selling a used iPhone 11 Pro Max with 83% battery health. (after a full day of 'heavy' use I'm still left with about 20%)

There is only one audio issue, and it's ONLY when on a phone call. 

When on a phone call, you need to:

A) put the phone on speakerphone OR B) Wear headphones.

It's a strange issue, I am not sure why this started happening.

Everything else is in 100% working condition...cameras, speakers (music/videos), charging port, etc. 

There are NO CRACKS in the glass. Factory unlocked for any carrier (see last picture)

Repairs: None.

Thank you and feel free to contact me if you are interested! I will ship same day if you make your payment by 2:00 PM CST.

I received a few records (good mix of genres) in the mail this week. 

Finally received the oldest preorder I had, Ghibli Tape. Then not far behind it was Soothing Breeze. Both your average LoFi hip hop beats. I did enjoy the Ghibli tapes much more than this LofiGirl release. Although Soothing Breezes still had its moment. Was also greatly surprised they cut it at 45RPM. 

I was lucky enough to grab the Brandi Carlile from the drop after they cancelled some other orders (over limit or international) a couple weeks ago. Been getting more and more into her lately.  This record did not disappoint. She is a hell of a singer/songwriter.

Dour Candy was a welcome surprise. Just recently got into Billy Woods solo stuff and have enjoyed it quite a bit. Haven‚Äôt given this a spin yet, but it‚Äôs up next this evening.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","You are building up resentment, and you are losing your feelings for her. She seems to be with you because you can help her with her career. Is she with you because she loves you and cares about you or because you can help her with her projects. You have mismatched libidos, at best, at worse, she has lost physical attraction for you.

Also, the reduced sex and the anger and arguing are red flags that she may have someone else. Not saying she does but those are definite red flags. But, it really doesn't matter, you need to look at what this relationship is doing for you.

The arguing, the lack of sexual attraction on her part lead to drama. As you said you couldn't avoid the arguing if you tried. Maybe it is time to move on and let her move on. Don't stay in a relationship because of how it was, stay or don't stay for how it is NOW. If you decide to stay in this relationship maybe Couples counseling with a good unbiased counselor would help.

&amp;#x200B;

Good Luck, Stay Safe, Stay Strong.

Edit to add, maybe do some investigation, There are so many cheating stories on reddit that start out just like you describe.

While I was working I was spending my nights learning 3D programs and after 6 years of moonlighting personal projects and working full time I found out one of my friends worked for a studio and got in as a junior artist. It was tough to change and the only reason I ended up in the industry is thanks to covid or I probably never would have been able to switch. Thankfully enough the transition was smooth but it can take people years to end up at a studio. So the advice I'd have for you is to learn as much as you can before making the switch to hit the ground running if you can.",1656633759

Companies with public status also tend to have a favorable outlook with private and public investors when looking for alternative funding. This is also true for lending and supply companies, so public companies are likely to be able to get good financing options.

ETA: I did this with two platonic friends.  He &amp; she were spending a lot of time at his parents' house (complicated family reasons); his mom started dropping hints, wondering what was up, and he had to tell his mom flat out that it wasn't like that, and nothing was going to happen.",1656633760

Even if you just took a glance they‚Äôre far more likely to help if they feel like you‚Äôve put in effort already. 

Poor management of interns is common. Frequently newer managers or first few times managing interns often assign overly complex tasks but usually you get support to make progress in that case. 

If there‚Äôs someone else to seek advice from on team make sure to ask them (another resource you can mention trying to tap) and if your manager isn‚Äôt the manager of your team try escalating and saying you feel like you‚Äôre not receiving support needed

Frankly you have to advocate for yourself a lot and be very clear with trouble you‚Äôre having and why to management. Try to leave a paper trail to justify I attempted to receive help x amount of times but wasn‚Äôt successful. Being self-driven and well-documented usually is a huge boon for your odds of return.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Sounds like you were doing good. You gave her lots of affection, were emotionally available, spent time together and formed happy memories. I think any normal girl would be pleased with that. Yet she disrespected you by talking to all sorts of other guys. That is in no way your fault, it was her selfish choice. And you were right to leave. She told you she wouldn't commit unless certain conditions were met. But I'm willing to bet she wouldn't favor you even if you did change for her. If you think back and genuinely can't recall times where you actually hurt her or anything, then you weren't the problem here. 

Someday a girl will come along who appreciates the things you do and the kindness you show her. As a general rule, just remember to treat her like a fellow human being and not put her on a pedestal.

"FermiParadox","t5_38g9n","Since the milky way is ""only"" 100k light years wide, and a civilization may have had upwards of 10 billion years to colonize it, it's likely easy in an astronomical sense.

If a civilization just traveled at 1/10th the speed of light and took 1000 years at every new planet before colonizing the next, it still works out to be possible to colonize the galaxy in something like a hundred million years -- fast enough for some to have done it 140 time over by now.

"Wales","t5_2qhrl","More like the Wales Act 2017 rolled back parts of devolution by creating a huge list of reserved powers, some of which were previously devolved, despite the UK government‚Äôs PR being all about giving Wales more power.

The Welsh government can no longer pass laws in these areas because the UK government suddenly decided it didn‚Äôt want those powers to be devolved any more. The Welsh government weren‚Äôt taking advantage of some kind of loophole when they wrote the trade union law, they were simply taking advantage of the powers they were given, only for the UK government to take those powers away, simply because it wanted to. 

The UK government is ‚Äúreasserting it‚Äôs legal rights‚Äù in the sense that they have the legal right to do, well, basically anything they like so long as they write a law about it. Parliamentary sovereignty means that they can rewrite the rules as they see fit, there is no real separation of power in the UK.",1656633762

As I understand it that limited abortions to what was *then* considered viable; the end of the 2nd trimester (27wks). 

I'm not arguing Roe *should have* been overturned, what I'm saying is that what we need is another similar ruling /(over-over turn?) that replaces it... maybe with some allowances for both sides to not feel utterly screwed (and not keep flipping it every few years). 

The alternative is that it stays a state decision, and people just move to where their ideologies align... and states have to deal with the possibility of a reshuffling.",1656633765

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The amount being paid is a separate issue altogether. Many men can't afford the child support, and many women can't afford to drag a man to court for paternity and payments owed. It's a wash. 

My point about vasectomies is that it's a way for men to opt out without needing to have gotten a women pregnant and thus removing their own risk. Financially, it's a big price tag upfront, but cheaper than child support. Women can't have a hysterectomy or have their tubes tied as easily since many doctors won't perform them at will. So that's a plus on the men's side in terms of bodily autonomy. 

I'm not saying that anyone should abstain, I'm not entirely sure where you got that from. I believe that anyone involved in procreation is accepting of the risks therein. Abortion does not need to have a reason other than the will of the woman going through it, and many of them go through it because the man involved in getting them pregnant is uninterested in accepting his half of the risk, and if abortion is under attack, men should not be allowed to opt out financially at the very least. If women cannot walk away from a pregnancy, then men should not be able to as well. If women have the right to bodily autonomy, and choose to carry to term, then anyone involved in the conception should be responsible for it unless all parties agree not to.   

We can talk about overhauling parental rights here until we're blue in the face, but my point is that one side is uniquely at a disadvantage due to biology and to compare abortion and anything else, even vasectomies included, is to undermine the issue entirely, to my mind. It draws on anger that men face for feeling shafted when it comes to responsibility and easily draws a line to disliking the idea of freedom that they see women have with the idea of abortion, as if it's a 'get out of jail free' card that they can't play.

"NewRiders","t5_3hdbs","You are not alone. I (26F) have severe anxiety in my daily life. Naturally some of it carries over into riding. I went down (lowsided) making a hard left in a parking lot several months ago when I was brand new and have lasting nerve damage and knee pain from hitting the pavement and rolling. What was more lasting was the fear from then on of making left turns, or any normal tight turns at moderate speed. I'm still getting over it, and I am riding on the road now. I have less trust in my bike's traction than I should because of a mistake *I* made.

I dropped my bike (and myself lol) in a parking lot last week going to get lunch. Before I remembered to get up and turn off the bike, I just laid on my back in pain and embarrassment for a good 5 seconds. I was in a bad mood for the rest of the day. I let that experience ruin my good time, which I regret.

Also, it took me a long, long 8 months to get to riding on the road. I admire you for having the courage to be on the highway so soon. I couldn't do what you did!

I wish we could ride together because no one seems to have the same kind of anxiety as I do. Everyone I talk to has been riding their whole life or is super relaxed and just naturally good at it. It makes me feel alienated.

Edit: I also second what someone else said, go for a quick errand. Nothing more. Just the comfort of something mundane and familiar you do in your car, but on your bike. On my first solo ride I went to my favorite coffee shop. I got some practice, wasn't overwhelmed, and still felt accomplished.",1656633766
"depression","t5_2qqqf","No, we are not. I am living with a depressed girlfriend and i swear to god i am believing more and more that depressed people's sense of happiness is fucked up. No, we're not happy. Life hits us as well. Am i happy if i win the fucking lottery? Yes, i am. For a few moments, after that an idiot will cut me off in traffic and bam, the happiness is gone. 

What you remember of being a good life without depression it's just a desire. Not being depressed doesn't make you happy. Not at all. Not even close. 

The other thing i've managed to learn is that you never find people that cannot afford to be depressed to sink into it. I'm an example of that. If i'm going to get depressed now, i'm losing my life. There's nobody to support me, nobody to pay for me, i cannot afford a mental illness. I find intrigueing how mental disorders often come from affording to have one (i don't mean that disrespectfully, i mean that as in someone that picks up depression, has to have in the back of his mind the safe net as well, hence otherwise, if you know deep down you cannot afford it, you won't go there)

On-topic again, still no. It's just a slimy fucked up life everyday and we just find senses of joy throught it, that's all. We just... Enjoy a cigar, enjoy a walk, enjoy being disconnected.

Deco has handled this whole negotiation poorly, all they had to do was just be honest with all clubs involved earlier and this impasse would've been prevented , with him going to his desired club and for less without a bidding war, win-win. 
Instead now there's a conflict of interest between an agent/scout and the agreement they had made too prematurely because they banked on Leeds being relegated.

I can mostly understand why some fans are on edge, following the Lukaku saga, however, either way we should end up with a right winger and seem to be in a steady position contrary to popular belief.

Barca have been forced to re-enter the market with a higher bid being the standard, and if they conform then that means Dembele is out of contract.

Her cute high pitched voice has become annoying to me. She constantly wants attention and is constantly chattering. She talks for no reason sometimes, just to talk about nothing. It's very draining. 

My new fiance also drained my battery at times and I explained to him the importance of ""me time"". He too is a chatter box. I feel over stimulated with too much  noise, and he is a very energetic person. He's an extrovert. 

I learned that listening to nonstop chatter drains me. I become annoyed. I do not enjoy the constant sound of someone's voice.

I d understand if the criticism for the party was uncalled for and made no sense, but the things he brings up are completely reasonable. Also just by listening to 3 of his past 9 videos today, he EXPLICITLY says not to vote for Democrats and Republicans and he clarifies that he has said this for the past 6 years now (since 2016). 

https://youtu.be/9g6nLZBY-QQ

Here‚Äôs a video that he posted yesterday where he explicitly says what I just told you in the first 30 seconds. Also, why does Jimmy have to go after Republicans? Everyone knows they‚Äôre pieces of shit and you also have 5/6 mainstream media corporations going after R‚Äôs every single day, while also pandering too and protecting the Democrat party. Why cover something when everyone already knows about it? Where else do you hear about the buying off of D‚Äôs politicians by corporate entities? Definitely not on CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NPR etc. 

And yes, you keep saying Jimmy only pushes culture war BS, even when I listed off many reasonable topics that have nothing to do with  the culture war.

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","Yeah, sure - let me tell you my theory on it. 

So, as far as I am concerned, the labor market is fixed the way we practice it. 

People's liveliehood is ultimately tied to working. No work, no food, no living inside, right? 

This leads to a massive oversupply of labor all the time. Markets generally seek an equilibrium, right? The labor market can't, because sellers of labor are forced to sell their labor no matter what. They have to, because if they don't, they lose everything. If this were to happen in a commodity market, companies would fold up until production reached a point where it could command a profitable price. When people fold up though, their lives are over. 

This wouldn't matter if humans didn't have basic needs, but since they do, it does. 

This, over time, has led to scenario where the ""free market"" value of labor just isn't known. Most people don't even think of it is being a product or service sold on a market at all. 

That's because with markets, generally, the seller determines the price of the product they produce or service they offer, not the buyer. The way our labor market works - buyers actually get to dictate the price of the service they're purchasing, which makes the labor market seem like something other than what it is. 

Anyway - this massive oversupply of labor has led to.. well, a massive oversupply of labor, meaning that a lot of it is very, very, cheap. In fact, much of it is SO cheap that it costs less to buy than it does to produce, and then the government has to step in and subsidize it ( think of all the ways it does this - they're plentiful ). 

This means companies have been accustomed to a labor market flush with cheap labor that never really goes away. This leads to inefficiencies and massive waste of labor hours, because they really don't value it. It's like milk at a processing plant.. the stuff costs nothing, so, if some gets wasted, is it really worth the cost to try to not waste it? A lot of times the answer is ""no.""

If you think I am wrong, think about how the Federal Reserve fights inflation. They do it by increasing interest rates until company's demand for labor starts to decline. Once there start to be a good # of unemployed people, everyone has to accept even lower wages, meaning they have less money to spend. Decreased money means decreased demand, which theoretically reduces prices of consumer goods. It is manipulation of labor demand.

To give a personal example, I did a solid 45 minutes of work today at work. There was nothing to do. It was dead. 7 of us sat and did basically nothing. But, we are all compensated so little for our time that none of us really WANT to leave, despite the fact that it was a beautiful day. We have bills to pay. Our employer doesn't want us to leave, because we cost so little that it is meaningless to them.

Currently, the Federal Reserve is increasing interest rates. My company has 150m in debt from a Federal Reserve bank. What do you think is going to happen when those interest rates get too high? Well, I'm going to lose my job, and join the ranks of people trying to offer labor for sale in a market that is utterly saturated with it, because I can't just fold up.",1656633767

"HPReverb","t5_yf22y","I posted an explanation about this on Discord before - I'll post here too.

Short version: it doesn't do anything

Long version:

\- This video is asking you to change some settings prefixed ""Stereo"" and ""RHW"" in the Nvidia driver. These settings are tweaks for the software support of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia\_3D\_Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_3D_Vision) glasses, which is a product over 10 years old and has nothing to do with VR as we know it today.

\- These settings were used by the 3D Vision software to re-create stereoscopic images from 2D images. Nothing in SteamVR or OpenXR uses these settings.

\- The string ""VRdirectx"" is used to select what application executable the Nvidia settings profile is applied to. In fact, ""VRdirectx"" has nothing to do with Virtual Reality, it corresponds to the name of the executable for the game V-Rally 99. So when you enter those settings for ""VRdirectx"", you are instructing the driver to apply the settings if and only if an application called ""vrdirectx.exe"" is launched.

\- Nvidia discontinued support for the 3D Vision software in their driver in 2019 (see Wikipedia link above). So effectively, these settings aren't even read by the driver anymore.

On all 4 counts described above, these options are doing absolutely nothing.

Some people reported seeing a difference, but it's quite likely just a side effect of using the Nvidia Inspector tool and resetting other values to their default in the process, and had nothing to do with the unused, discontinued settings for V-Rally 99 running on 3D Vision glasses.",1656633768

"NuclearRevenge","t5_ryjkl","Tampa and surrounding areas can be weird when it comes to real estate. And it surprised me a bit coming from upstate New York

But with the amount of waterfront property, waterfront adjacent property, historical neighborhoods, and downtown/marketplace type areas. It makes for some unexpected property values.

Instead of like a lot of areas where you will have almost entire neighborhoods separated by income level. There are a lot of areas where you will have houses that are high 6 figures to low 7 figures. Then the house directly across the street with an identical floor plan can be low to mid 6 figures.  Then just 1 or 2 blocks away it could be high 5 figures to low 6 figures.

And just to complicate things even more. Because a lot of people want to live as close to the water or downtown as possible. You will have condos being built that change entire neighborhoods.  And prices can go through the roof. Just as an example a friend of mine purchased a house around 3 years ago for like 65k or 70k.  And the 2 houses to the east of him have identical lot sizes, similar square footage, and similar floor plans.  And someone bought both of them for 90k 3 months after my friend purchased his, and they wanted his as well but he wouldnt sell.  They literally just put a coat of paint, and cheap vinyl snap lock flooring and a little over a year ago both houses sold for like 290k each.",1656633768

"sydney","t5_2qkob","The trick is to understand what a ""flood watch"" is compared to a ""flood warning"". 
Of you read the flood watch alert, it goes into more detail. These can also be found on the BOM website, or the BOM app (the superior weather app in any case).

""Flood watch""
Conditions are right to maybe get a flood, it's too early to tell and we can't be precise enough about smaller enough areas that it would matter.
Keep paying attention to the news and think about what you would do in case of flooding.

""Flood warning""
It's going to flood in the next 24-48hrs. 
Here is exactly how high it will be at your area.
Get ready and if necessary gtfo.


That's the difference. It currently says minor to major because different areas can have very different experiences depending on their local situation.
Windsor can flood and downstream can be dry.


Important: Both kinds of alerts get updated regularly. Especially Flood Warnings can get worse over time as more data comes in. So stay alert and on top of it.


If you are at risk of flooding, you should have a plan. Where do you put things to keep them out of the water? How long will it take you? Are you at risk of being cut off? When does this happen relative to your local rover gauges? How much time do you need to get out before that happens?

So I imagine the windshield would have a rubber gasket too. And judging by the bends at the end and how long it is compared to your bed I would say it just might be part of your window gasket if they actually put one on the windshield from the factory. It would be replaced if it came with one. so your mind should rest easy knowing it's not important to the sound dampening or shock absorption of your truck. When I did work for a dealer I have seen that in the past where they would put the pulled stuff in the back and toss them out when they are done with the vehicle.

Well how many of those 7 hours were put to good use?

- Breakfast break
- Morning Tea Break
- Lunch Break
- Afternoon Tea Break

Don't forget Solat Jumaat and Smoke breaks too.

Your direct supervision should either be a licensed engineer or someone with an ABET accredited degree and 10+ years of experience.

For me, I think the constant pressure to not ""be gay"" societally and my own natural unease with other men just made realizing that very hard. Men, even as friends, have always made me uncomfortable to some extent, so picturing being intimate with another guy just seemed so... uncomfortable. Maybe this isn't the case for you, but I figured I'd share since it does sound similar to how I felt.

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","I think it's fair enough to be seriously worried though, not only is the Dobbs decision itself a major blow to bodily autonomy, it has a wide range of potential ramifications. The right of over half of the population to make healthcare decisions about their own body has already been taken away, there's no reason to think it can't be eroded even further.

Alabama has already put forward legislation to try to forcibly detransition all trans people under 18 for example, directly referencing Dobbs as their justification. There are already reports of women being denied prescription medication they rely on because it can be used to overdose and force a miscarriage, there are already women trying to buy unsafe doses of OTC meds that are known to lead to possible miscarriage along with a huge host of extra side effects. The right to make decisions about marriage leans on the very same clause of the constitution that Dobbs attacked; neither same-sex marriage or interracial marriage have a ""long standing tradition"" within US law (which is what they argued abortion rights would need in order to stay protected- the right to interracial marriage is only 5 years older than RvW was). The right for disabled people to be free from institutional influences on their reproductive rights comes from the same clause; there are lots of people still living today who were forcibly sterilised by the US government because of a disability, and the protections against that are looking weaker now.

So yeah, even if you don't imminently need an abortion yourself, you should be very worried.",1656633772

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","""An artist's limitations are their best friends."" Paraphrased from Frank Lloyd Wright.

I'm sorry, but I have to call shenanigans on your first assertion. Characters are _absolutely_ made at random all the time. The NPC you didn't expect your party to notice. The shopkeeper in that town they adopted as their favorite vacation spot. The endless list of lute-curious hookups the bard keeps making. Even when I'm writing long-form fiction, I find places in stories where I need _somebody_ and I don't already have anyone in mind, but I don't need anyone in _particular_. There are all kinds of possible spaces in all kinds of different narratives in which characters aren't _crafted_ so much as _grown_.

And I can't speak to your creative process, but that's pretty much what I do what I do when it comes to gender, sexuality, ancestry, lineage, and the like. I have demographics for my cities and countries, and I can do some basic math. Why _not_ let the random people the party meets be random? Sure, I get characters with complex personal stories, but I doubt they're any less convoluted than some real-life folks' histories I know.

As for creativity being stifled, I'd say I feel the opposite! This has encouraged me to find new ways of thinking about the characters I make and forcing me to rethink aspects of my world to be big enough to encompass all this variety. My players certainly haven't complained; I routinely get compliments on the complexity and depth of my NPCs and the variety of backstories they encounter.

And what does ""thematically appropriate sexuality"" even mean, anyway?",1656633772

I can go to a store and buy a whole pack of hot dogs for 99 cents and a pack of buns for 99 cents, so that's $2 for 8 hot dogs.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt; The problem is that your simple explanation for determining the amount of simple labor is absurd on its face.

Why is that?  What else would you think ""simple labor"" means?  Surely you do not imagine that we are somehow magically endowed with skilled labor, but instead, when we're born, have little more than the basic human faculties corresponding to our physical and mental constitution as a basic human.  It is only through application of such that we develop skills either in the present, or historically.  But even those skills which are developed through history, as a process of iterative improvement throughout generations and passed down through various mediums, still needed to be built from ""simple labor"" and the acquisition of such through those mediums still must start with simple labor of learning how to read and write, basic arithmetic, first scientific principles and experimentation, etc.

&gt; Skilled labor doesn‚Äôt add some tiny fraction of value that is massively eclipsed by rudimentary simple labor.

I have no idea what ""massive eclipsing"" you're referring to.  20% difference doesn't seem particularly ""tiny.""  In either case, it's an a simple hypothetical example to explain the principle (since you're clearly struggling with the basic concept).  Nothing, in principle, would prevent certain forms of labor from constituting multiple times more relative to other forms of labor.  Surely this can all be compounded by the fact that the more specialized the labor, the less its labor costs would be dispersed across a broad population of laborers as the populations would become increasingly narrower.  Also, like capital, a given form of labor which goes into the production of skilled labor, can itself be compounded.

&gt; I hope this is just some dumb ass thing you came up with rather than something you were taught.

You just pissed cause you got owned like a noob.  Betting you had serious issues with ""word problems"" in math when you were younger too.  If it takes Betty 3 hours to make a cake now, but by practicing a certain technique for 10 hours, she can reduce that time to 2 hours, how many cakes will Betty have to make before she saves time by practicing?

They do that by presenting evidence of the term being used in relevant documents in multiple ways. If that turns out to be the case, they then turn to extrinsic evidence. They look at statements made by the people who wrote the law and derive intentions, they look at the usage of the word in industry, they look the context and stated goals of the law. Eventually they come down to a decision based on that.

Yeah, they do this process in **litigation**. A hugely expensive, highly time consuming ordeal (I know, I've been involved in a fairly big litigation (&gt; 1M at stake for the whole case, though my portion was only 40k). It took two years to litigate.

Like, litigation is literally about the most expensive legal situation you can be in.

Sure, lawyers can do it, but it's exactly what I am saying above - it introduces ambiguity - which are only resolved during court proceedings, which are fucking massively time consuming and expensive.

That's literally been my whole point here.

Hey, how about not be fucking condescending, eh? I didn't ""learn Javascript yesterday"" - I'm an engineer with about a decade of experience. I have, as I said, discussed law/programming with a lawyer (who I've linked to here), who specifically said he felt that programming and the law worked similarly.

&gt;
&gt;Judge Gorsuch: Senator, again, I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed. The reliance interest considerations are important there, and all of the other factors that go into analyzing precedent have to be considered. It is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was reaffirmed in Casey in 1992 and in several other cases. So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.
&gt;
&gt;Grassley: What about Griswold, which was decided a few years before Roe, the case where the Court found constitutional right to privacy? Can you tell me your views on Griswold?
&gt;
&gt;Judge Gorsuch: Senator, it is a precedent that is now 50 years old. Griswold involved the right of married couples to use contraceptive devices in the privacy of their own home. And it is 50 years old. The reliance interests are obvious. It has been repeatedly reaffirmed. All very important factors again in analyzing precedent.

Yeah Griswold is doomed.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","The earplugs and Xanax are meant to be used BEFORE you get confronted. They help you ignore and walk away from confrontations. Which is 90% of de-escalations. Just avoid the entire situation.

At no point did the person I responded to mention allready being shot at. The idea was ""confrontation with people going off the handle"". At no point there is there a mention of a gun. Therefor there is no need for a gun. Just walk away or avoid it before hand.

In the situation where there IS a gun there are several options:
1. The gun is aimed at you. Congrats. Game over. Don't bother reaching for your own. You'll probably die. Just hand over money or comply untill you get a better chance.

2. The gun is not aimed at you, but the wielder can see you and other people are in danger. You have a chance here. Be quick, be deadly, don't fire more bullets then needed.

3. The gun is not aimed at you, the wielder cannot see you and other people are in danger. Act swift but thoughtful. Take your time to aim.

4. Gun is not aimed at you, wielder can see you no other people are in danger. Same as number 2. Unless you have a good avenue of escape without him getting a shot off. Best not to take chances.

5. Gun is not aimed at you, wielder cannot see you, no other people are in danger. Just GTFO. As a civilian, this is not your problem to deal with.

Now to adress the ""good guy with a gun myth"" REALLY quick. There is no evidence to back up this claim. There are EXTREMELY rare occasions where it just happens to go right. But for all of those cases there are multiple involuntary dangerous discharges, people getting shot by police because surprise surprise cops don't know by instinct who the good guys and the bad guys are and multiple instances where collateral damage by ""good guys"" was worse then the damage the shooter did. That's why bringing a gun into that situation might be a bad idea.

Also:
Almost the entire fucking world has basically said: it's a bad idea for civilians to have guns. Numbers back this up as well. For all the people carrying guns, you's expect america to be a really safe nation. But it isn't. It's almost as if introducing guns into any type of situation is going to make it more volatile.

So basically having a gun as a civilian is a really bad idea unless you're really really good with them and you show extreme restraint in it's use.

Now I can go through the numbers with you on how many gundeaths and self injuries there are vs ""times armed civilians saved lives"", but I assume you can do that research. And please please please don't ""trust you gut"" on this one or say ""it doesn't sound logical"", because if you have been raised in a certain frame of mind, without having the objective scientific data: it will feel that way. That's how they get you.

So trust me when I, as an small arms and CQB instructor tell you that arming civilians is usually a bad idea, because half of them have no fucking clue what they're doing, a quarter are gonna Rambo it up and be even more dangerous, another bunch are mentally unstable and a danger to themselves and others and maybe a few percent will be responsible gunowners.... and maybe they don't need to be gunowners.

It's as if your implying that someone can't be discriminated against here because in other places someone might be discriminated against more. Discrimination  is still Discrimination. You take away other peoples truths when you overlook their challenges.

He settled on a town called Deadwood and wrote one of the best pilots ever written for TV.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","""Delta 8"" is short for [delta-8-THC](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Delta-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol), which is slightly different from [delta-9-THC](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#query=delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) that is the main active ingredient in marijuana. If you look at the 2-D pictures I linked, the top right corner of the molecule has a hexagon with a line against one of the walls - the location of that line is slightly different for the two molecules.*

All drugs have a specific shape to them, and that shape interacts with parts of our brain. The delta-8 shape is *very* close to the delta-9 shape. So close that they affect your brain in almost exactly the same way as far as we can tell. This is different from other synthetic weed, which have [completely different](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/JWH-018-benzimidazole-analog) chemical structures and affect your brain VERY differently. 

Delta-8 is legal because of the [2018 Farm Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2) which says that hemp farmers shouldn't need to worry about getting busted for growing marijuana. Basically, anything that hemp plants naturally make is legal as long as the final product has less that a certain amount of delta-9 THC. Since delta-8 is found in hemp plants, it is completely legal (unless specified by state law). 

Delta-8 does not grow naturally in large concentrations, so instead it's made by converting it from CBD oil. If you see bud that's labeled delta-8, it's just sprayed on, and to editorialize, should probably be avoided; concentrates and edibles seem much more reliable. 

Finally, while it is legal, it will probably still make you fail most drug screening. If you can convince whoever gave you the screen to do a real lab test you will pass, but most employers who drug test just don't give enough of a shit, so don't think you're safe if your employer regularly tests. 

*Probably a bit beyond ELI5, but chemistry is cool: The lines represent bonds between carbon atoms, so that second line that moved between delta-8 and delta-9 represents a double bond. Carbon atoms involved in a double bond usually have flat geometry compared to atoms with only single bonds, which usually have tetrahedral geomtry. Moving that double bond means a flat part becomes no longer flat, and a previously not-flat part becomes flat. That's why the 3D shape is slightly different.",1656633778

"Borderlands","t5_2r8cd","Ah, I see. I find that Berserk usually lasts long enough on its own to provide decent healing without the need for any investment (pro tip, equipping a Centurion class mod before Berserking will regenerate health the fastest), so I don't bother putting any skills into the Brawler tree when I play gun Brick. The only two Berserk related skills I go for are Bash (more useful than any tier 1 Brawler skills) and Liquidate (I run Blast Master, so might as well). Die Hard usually gives me all the health I need. Since Brick relies more on shields anyway, anything more than half health is good enough.

I play Brick extremely aggressively as well, so that kind of confuses me. I decided to run Old Haven as a level 69 Blast Master Brick just to make sure my memory of his gameplay wasn't messed up, and I could go through the entire area just stomping directly towards enemy's firing my gun. I had a 3000 strength shield boosted to around 4400, Unbreakable would regenerate 528 of that per second when it activated, but with Juggernaut active, 4 or 5 Lancemen couldn't even trigger Unbreakable before I had killed them all. A few instances of FFYL kept my health and shields topped up. The only time I went down twice in a row was against a point-blank Badass Defender backed up by 3 or 4 other Lancemen, and Rocket Launcher spam easily solved that once I decided to stop testing my guns. Regardless, I don't treat Unbreakable as some sort of saving grace, but as just more shield strength. Excess damage will get through the regeneration, and once Unbreakable triggers I start setting up for a Second Wind. The beefy Pangolin shields take forever to recharge, so getting them all back for free is the fastest way to get going again.

Anyway, if you used a Titan class mod to try and boost Unbreakable, that encourages a significantly more cautious playstyle, Unbreakable chaining. 9/5 in Unbreakable regenerates 108% (the game lies, Unbreakable regenerates 12%/s, not 15%) of your max shield strength, which refreshes Unbreakable, which allows for infinite shields. A Brick running Titan is best played cautiously, tanking with his massive shields but paying close attention to his shield strength to make sure he can get behind cover when Unbreakable triggers. It's an interesting twist on how Brick usually does things, and much more effective than using the increased regeneration to tank. If things go wrong and Unbreakable leaves you with low shields, than it's FFYL time.

In my experience, offensive gun Brick's work best by facing danger head on, not even trying to avoid damage. There are very few enemies that can actually threaten to kill you, so eating everything tends to be very effective. Those few exceptions do require a little more caution, but it's nothing that some smart gameplay and/or a few rockets can't fix. Titan Brick's will use cover a little more often, but only when Unbreakable is about to trigger. Melee Brick's are the only ones who make heavy use of cover, since if you get shot too much you can't move, and if you can't move you can't hurt anyone, and no matter how much health you have it's only a matter of time until you die at that point. Especially since Melee Brick's don't have good gun damage boosts, so going down can be dangerous even with Die Hard backing you up.

EDIT: One last thing I want to mention, I find the problem with Brick's defensive skills isn't really them being weak, it's Brick being too big. Brick is massive, so massive he can't properly crouch behind low cover, and that size means he gets hit a lot more often. It makes sense since in a team a Brick that can act as living cover is pretty useful, but in single player it results in Brick eating so many bullets it can become difficult to move or even aim. This is why I emphasize facing damage head on, because Brick genuinely can't avoid damage.",1656633778

 Kushida only went to such extreme lengths in Volume 5 because of a threat from Yagami, who threatened her that he would reveal her secret if he didn't expel Kiyo and Suzune.  Then Suzune, the one Kushida hates the most, stood up for Kushida in front of the whole class.  She broke her word, but still defended Kushida, praised her abilities and sincerely praised her communication skills.  And Kushida just burst into tears when she saw her nemesis go and protect her, and sincerely acknowledge her abilities.  Kushida thought that her mask could never be liked, but Suzune understood and accepted it, just like Kiyo accepted Suzune back in the day, and Kiyo accepted Sudou.  Of course, as Kiyo mentioned at the end of the exam in Volume 5, this took a toll on Kushida.  Then in Volume 6, they talked, Suzune shamed her, lowered her pride and dignity, taunted her.  And I think Kushida's change was very logical and well written, because Kushida couldn't be who she was before.",1656633778

And what the hell do they think people are there for when being interviewed for a job‚Ä¶ shits and giggles??

NTA. If the salary isn‚Äôt suitable, then d we go waste anyones time buy beating around the bush? And anyway personally I wouldn‚Äôt want to work for anyone/any company that views it in such away, with that personality in regards to this, because you know full well they will at some point mess you around, or fuck you over with pay, and will likely try to squeeze the life out of you while paying you as little as the can get away with.

Never trust employers that stumble around the discussion of wage/salary, even if salary that‚Äôs discussed is not suitable for someone involved, nonetheless it should always be discussed with no pissing around. If the employer pisses around in regards to the questions of salary, then just walk away because if not then that behaviour will most definitely be shown in further scenarios down the line, even with stuff that don‚Äôt involve money‚Ä¶ it just shows that you‚Äôll be dealing with a setup that will rather mess folk around just to get what they want instead of just being upfront about things, and it could be a wide variety of scenarios‚Ä¶ not just were money is concerned.

Big red flag, I would‚Äôve walked away as well.

Edit: also, 15 minutes is sufficient enough time in an interview to have the question of salary be asked and to be answered honestly and fairly by the employer, if there‚Äôs no straight answer to that or even an estimation that would suffice in some cases, then yeah, I‚Äôd be gone.",1656633778

Only recently did it finally pass and it's in the works. Seems disingenuous to include this, unless there's something I'm missing.

Also, it's not that conservative rural areas are given more weight in Congress. It's that rural areas are given more weight, by design, and they tend to lean conservative. This weighting isn't new, nor is it a secret. Originally it started with states rights, small states didn't want to get dominated by the will of large states (slavery was also a big reason but that doesn't apply anymore). That's evolved into avoiding city culture dominating rural culture. Voting power was never supposed to be directly proportional to population, we wanted a diversity of opinions in government.

Also, both parties are gerrymandering. Republicans are just better at it. I agree it should be illegal but there's no reason the Democrats can't win the gerrymandering battle.

Edit: Also, the cap issue is misrepresented. Wyoming is one of only 3 states to have a lower population than the average populace per Representative. In other words, there's roughly one Representative for every 760k people by Wyoming only has a population of 560k. So yes, their Representative has a little more power than your average CA representative, but it's by necessity. Are we really going to complain about Wyoming's one representative? How many does CA have again? OP also neglected to mention the underrepresented states with 900k population but still only one Representative. Honestly a lot of this post seems very disingenuous.",1656633779

"VirginityExchange","t5_37f87","So you have to ""crush"" _at least_ two virginities and convince these fine people to pose with you before you can post offering a ""crushing"".

I have to say it seems odd to me. It sounds like very few people if anyone will get that verification unless you DO prey on virgins. That means scouring the subreddit messaging people, numbers game... there is actually something unsettling about the concept of ""V-Crusher"" being a seperate status. Why not limit it some other way? A specific tag in the title, and no more than one post every week or even month. I don't know.


I'll be honest, I lost my virginity thanks to this subreddit. They posted and I sent a message to present myself. Knowing them, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't/couldn't have gone through that verification process despite being a very respectable and pleasant person.

I imagine many people here might be too shy/uncommitted to post and would be more inclined to message privately a person of their choice. I believe it to be the better course of action for women particularly who get such an overwhelming response.


I don't know. I was tempted to post here to ""return the favor"" given my experience and how I wish things were for me. I don't intend to repeat the experience, it's more of a stars aligning and if I truly believe I can help a particular person with similar struggles/anxieties. The way the verification is though, it is simply impossible.

Then one day an old friend Of mine dropped of a box of broken laptops for me to tinker with, at the very bottom was a broken 2011 Mac book pro. (bad HDD) I had an extra 256 ssd so  slapped it in and googled how to do an internet recovery .  after a while it was up and running .  Then I loaded my AMP sim in to Garage band and it just worked perfectly zero tinkering.. I was shocked! Until that moment I've always been super anti Apple..   I have since built a Hackintosh that didn't break the bank and works really well. I only use it for My DAW.

it just works, this is why people buy them.

I don't think anyone could cope with 12 straight hours of screaming, so give yourself some grace, but we can try to find some solutions

If you can afford daycare, do that. Children often cope best with 2-3 days.

If you can't afford it, look into financial aid in your country. I know there's also some kind of  Head Start program in the US that supports certain demographics (I'm not US, I just heard about it)

If you slip through the financial gap and have no support system, go to a library. Most have children's story times.

Are there any mother's groups or playgroups in your area?

Have you checked for any underlying cause of the screaming? For example a medical condition or a developmental delay? If there's a delay, there are early intervention programs that would at least give you some connection 

Finally, you mentioned your husband isn't speaking to you. I don't know your husband but I work with family violence, so just asking - Do you feel safe? Do you have access to money? If not, a women's refuge will support you",1656633780

Sure thing, I've got more suggestions for you.

Julien Baker is the Queen of sad. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdBu21i9aEE&amp;ab_channel=MatadorRecords) is the song that introduced me to her. If that is your vibe, check out her album Sprained Ankle. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agawN3Nq5Ng&amp;ab_channel=Pitchfork) live performance of hers is also phenomenal... I've watched it a dozen times...

Phoebe Bridgers is the other queen of sad. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sfYpolGCu8&amp;ab_channel=PhoebeBridgersVEVO) one of her most popular songs. If you happen to see a friend listening to her a lot on Spotify, ask if they're ok.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb3nGYGQ0J4&amp;ab_channel=JulienBaker-Topic) is a collaboration that the queens of sad did together. It's ethereal.... If I have headphones on and I close my eyes I feel like I'm floating listening to it. The lyrics are so sad yet it makes me so happy. Hard to explain.

And one more for good measure. Gotta throw something [uplifting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4iMiIZo2LU&amp;ab_channel=LadyBri-Topic) in here. This has been my morning vibe for the week.

Enjoy. Let me know which ones you like :-) If you're into it I've also got a handful of spoken-word-poetry that got me through some tough days.",1656633782

No attempt at nuance is made for any of these... except psychopathy, which the writer notes has a medical definition that differs from the definition he's using. So obviously, if they wanted to be nuanced, they could've been. They simply chose not to be when it came to masochism, sadism, and addiction.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","First, let me offer a suggestion from my time in Planescape: Make the contract over something absolutely minor and unimportant. Just ridiculously so. I'd suggest something like ""exclusive rights to a road through the Feywild for the period of one week"" or ""Payment to be received as one of the \[completely meaningless and seemingly worthless\] 'New God' statues Vecna made when he failed to remake the world in his image"" during *Die, Vecna, Die!.* A baby is just *way too big* for either of the factions to have not checked the fine print and realized what was at stake. 

But make it clear that the devils and angels are willing to go to *war* to settle the contract, and may in fact *have* to, upsetting the entire balance and quite possibly tipping the entire Outer Planes to the Abyss, as the devils would lose the fight against them thanks to splitting their forces.

The whole thing is just... well...

OK, here's my honest opinion. The baatezu (devils) are too wrapped up in the Blood War and fighting the tanar'ri (demons) to give two craps about the fey as a whole, and the archons (angels) are mostly focused on evolving up the ladder to solar status and then merging with Mount Celestia itself, which is why they make such good servants for the gods who can grant that.",1656633783

Older review article that describes it as putatively a matter of having an inner experience of emotion that is actually a direct reflection of what the other person does (the reason for the use of ""mirror"" in ""mirror neuron""):

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010214002314

Lamm, C., &amp; Majdand≈æiƒá, J. (2015). The role of shared neural activations, mirror neurons, and morality in empathy‚ÄìA critical comment. Neuroscience Research, 90, 15-24.

&gt;One of the major conceptual findings of Singer et al.‚Äôs ‚Äúseed study‚Äù, which was probably also one of the reasons it had such a strong impact, was the observation that empathy recruits similar neural networks as the direct experience of the emotion one is showing empathy for. Confirming similar work in the domain of disgust (Wicker et al., 2003), their study showed that the anterior insular (AI) cortex and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC according to Vogt, 2005 but in some studies and in most initial work referred to as anterior cingulate cortex, ACC) were activated when observing the pain of others. This finding has since been confirmed by numerous subsequent studies, as documented by image-based and coordinate-based meta-analyses which have quantitatively integrated and summarized the available data (Fan et al., 2011, Lamm et al., 2011). Notably, AI and aMCC are part of the so-called pain neuromatrix, the network of brain areas that is activated when one undergoes painful stimulation oneself (Derbyshire, 2000). Resemblance between neural activity during direct emotion experiences and specific aspects of empathy (in particular motor resonance, see discussion below) was also observed in studies using other methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG), motor evoked potential transcranial magnetic stimulation (MEP-TMS), and even presurgical intracranial electrophysiology (e.g. Avenanti et al., 2005, Bufalari et al., 2007, Hutchison et al., 1999, Perry et al., 2010). The similarity between neural activations for self- and other-related emotion experiences has motivated the interpretation that recruiting mental representations that normally underlie direct emotion experiences is a central mechanism enabling empathy and affective resonance. In other words, it has been suggested that we are able to understand and share the emotions of others by (partially) processing them with our very own emotion system(s). This has also fostered interpretations placing processes such as simulation and self-projection at the core of empathy ‚Äì mechanisms of empathy that had already been proposed before the availability of functional neuroimaging evidence (Gallese and Goldman, 1998). Importantly, this view of empathy as a simulative process did not emerge in a vacuum. Rather, it was influenced by similar findings and interpretations in the motor domain, such as the discovery of mirror neurons, and claims that these neurons, which fire both when the individual performs an action and when it observes its execution by others, lie at the root of understanding others‚Äô actions (see Ferrari and Rizzolatti, 2014, for a recent review). Similarly, in social cognition, simulation and self-projection have been interpreted repeatedly as core mechanism of mentalizing, i.e., considering others‚Äô beliefs, intentions or thoughts (Goldman and Sebanz, 2005, Mitchell, 2009). We will critically discuss these claims and the available evidence for it below.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;These observations have led to the introduction of terms such as motor empathy and cognitive empathy, pitting them against affective empathy. However, it seems more useful in terms of conceptual clarity, and more in line with the definition of empathy as a phenomenon of affective sharing, to see motor, somatosensory and cognitive processes as key mechanisms (supported by distinct neural pathways) of evoking an empathic response, rather than as disparate components of the empathic response itself. For instance, we have recently demonstrated that the same network of AI and MCC thought to underlie the affective component of empathy can be engaged by distinct ‚Äúmotor‚Äù and ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù neural routes (Lamm et al., 2011). While evoking affective empathic responses by means of pictures of another person's body parts in painful conditions recruited parietal and premotor structures related to action observation, showing participants abstract visual cues that indicated the occurrence of painful electrical stimulation engaged brain areas related to mentalizing and perspective taking. 
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;As outlined above, there is compelling evidence that similar neural structures are activated when empathizing with someone and when directly experiencing the emotion one is empathizing with. However, what role these shared activations play in empathy is much less obvious. The range of possible explanations parallels the diversity of viewpoints in the debate on the functional role of mirror neurons that we will discuss in a later section (Csibra, 2008, Gallese and Goldman, 1998, Hickok, 2009, Uithol et al., 2011). Just as scientists have disagreed on whether mirror neuron responses serve action understanding or reflect action understanding, affective neural responses, such as the activations in aMCC and AI during empathy for pain, could either be interpreted as a route to understanding others‚Äô feelings on a more elaborate level, or as a mere sign of it.

There's more to the critique, but it's from what I can tell a pretty comprehensive overview of what mirror neurons might or might not represent or how they might or might not relate to empathy.

On a more everyday level outside of an fMRI, empathy is a capacity that most but not all kids develop through experiences of emotional attunement from an attachment figure.  Papers, books and youtube videos from Bessel van der Kolk, Dan Siegel and Peter Fonagy offer some different conceptualizations of this process that I think are more or less mutually compatible.  Kids who experience emotional activation within a normal range, who then have that recognized and reflected back to them by a stably present and caring adult, will tend to develop the ability over time to name both their own emotions and the emotions of others *as well as* to experience the commonality in inner states that some of that other research on mirror neurons is talking about (whether or not the current conceptualization of mirror neurons works out to be exactly the right description of the biological mechanisms).

"TheBoys","t5_2t2xg","I think the themes Kimiko and Frenchie are struggling with *are* related to the rest of the show. They're faced with the same dilemma everyone else is: bad things are happening, what are you going to do about it? Is it your responsibility to act? Do the ends justify the means? Should you work with bad people to accomplish your goals? How far is too far? How much collateral damage is acceptable? What makes you a good person or a bad one? Should you change who you are, and do you have the strength to do so? Etc.

I'm not sure why screen time off by themselves makes them irrelevant. A lot of characters, over the course of the show, have had their side arcs and then they intersect with the rest of the plot later. We followed The Deep when he joined a cult, and A-train with his attempts to stay relevant, through many scenes that were away from the rest of the cast. Those scenes still had a point.

I'm not arguing for you to like it of course. To each their own taste.

On a side note, I'm not a fan of Nina either but that's for a personal reason I can't fairly criticize the show for. I do like her dialogue with Frenchie, constantly taunting him about his past and telling him he can't change. I feel like this is all very relevant to what's going on in the rest of the show. But as for her actions being a little unbelievable in context... yeah I can see that criticism.

Maybe there's more to Nina that we don't know about? Doubt it, but there are two more episodes and probably several more plot twists to come.",1656633784

I purchased rescued produce from an organization that buys produce that spent too long in storage for grocery stores to be able to resell but are otherwise fine or maybe with minor blemishes. It is 30 kilo/70 lbs of produce every week for around 15 USD and last week I got about 8 cups worth of cherry tomatoes that were in good condition.

If you look up lacto fermenting online people really go overboard but basically its 2 tsp to 1 quart. I had the bell pint jars so I put a heaping spoon of kosher salt in each,  filled it with tomatoes, covered them with distilled water and added star anise, mustard seeds, coriander and basil, then just let it sit 2.5 days.

I kept fucking with it so I messed up one of the non-tomato jars but otherwise they came out really great. The tomatoes tasted pretty fresh and the juice was like sour pickle juice with anise flavoring, really good. I'm going to blend them into a cold side next time incorporating some of the juice. Also I need to figure out a good way to keep anything from floating, I'm thinking some screens in the jars 

Despite how much I wrote, it was really easy lol",1656633784

"SWlegion","t5_3nqdi","I suppose I should have explained my plan for this list. I'd split my force into three groups, which would each go after different objectives.

Jyn + pathfinders, Sabine + Clan Wren, and officer + troopers.

&gt;You have long range comlinks on clan wren

So that I can issue orders to clan Wren from Jyn or the officer, if need be.

&gt;Pathfinders can be good but infiltrate too far or too early and they can be wiped turn 1

I've played with pathfinders a lot, and I'm very aware of this.

&gt;You have a med Droid (who wants to be r1 to use) and a r4 gun on the same squad

My idea behind that is this squad would act more as a support for the other two. The two squads with Z-6s would be out in front, taking the brunt of the fighting, with the med droid squad hanging back to heal, give aims, and still lay down some fire. Admittedly, that may not actually work out that great, but it sounded good on paper.

&gt;grenades seem good, but are rarely used. By the time a unit gets into range 1 of my rebel troopers, either somethings gone wrong or I'm sacrificing them to slow down a more expensive unit. 

The particular grenades I'm using are smoke grenades. They allow you to put down a smoke token, which improves the cover of any unit whose leader is in range 1 of the token.

&gt;Apart from Sabine and Clan Wren, everything else is a white defense dice unit. Which means they will die.

Not necessarily. Jyn and Pathfinders have danger sense, which in my experience works really well, especially when paired with duck and cover. Also, Jyn and the troopers all have nimble, which when combined with vigilance (which Jyn has to use on herself, and the officer provides for the troopers) means they *always* have *at least* one dodge token. And then there's the aforementioned smoke grenades.",1656633785

These people are just trolls, antipsychiatrists who are just holistic naturalopaths at heart, coming up with all of this horseshit to make as much sense as possible, but they are fucking nuts. Anyone who sits there and babbles to me about how how there is no evidence schizophrenia is a fucking brain disease? Are you kidding me? I'm just atypical? How about all of the evidence about how schizophrenic people have different brains and different inflammation and immune gene activity in the brain, that's not biological evidence? What they mean is, we can't test you for it definitively, but they act like, there is no evidence sz people are different. 

Honestly the words and disease concept are not going to help me be accepted by my peers any more, the problem is that my peers are fucking stupid, and stuck up, and judge anyone who is a liability to them for any reason for any length of time, unless you have a cure for that, stay in Japan, don't need you. All of my progress in life came from using the disease model and treating it and building myself up, resilience, all of my wasted years were when I was anti psychiatry, trying to be holistic, trying to think of myself as just atypical, but they act like there is no harm following their way. Doing something stupid when you could be one of the lucky ones who DONT have really bad side effects AND have a life correcting reduction in symptoms, that makes you a victim of people like this, which I consider myself to have been. 

These are science-based matters that need debate, but these are the same old clowns who have been called out by their peers for antipsychiatry for years. There are people in every field of medicine who are against their own training, doctors, nurses, there are always people who think natural everything is best. I've had enough of these fancy assholes.

Possible AOTY: Ugly Season

Very good and growing in impact: Big Time

Very good: You Can‚Äôt Kill me, Once Twice Melody, Glitch Princess

Good but losing impact: Crash, Laurel Hell, Preachers Daughter, Bronco

Good at first but lost steam fast: Dawn FM, Caprisong (this one kills me, as it would actually be good without the interludes - especially the ones that are part of the songs, and a more fleshed out Pompemousse. I still listen to Magdalene weekly), Mr Morales, Muna

Actual disappointment: Dance Fever, Chlo√´

Current most anticipated: Maggie Rogers and Tove Lo 

It‚Äôs been a very weird year. Need another 2019 where every month there was an album that was literally too good to handle (NFR, Magdalene, All Mirrors, Pang, titanic rising, IGOR, heard it in a past life - I could go on for ever)",1656633786

"Dachshund","t5_2qpj2","My mom buys her dog the roasted marrow bones you can get on chewy. I don't know how to post a picture here, but I can post a couple links. They don't get left out all the time, just to keep the dogs quiet/occupied at certain times of the day and then are returned to the cupboard in the evening. The dogs know the routine and are cool with it now. They bones last weeks and never get buried this way!

The main criteria for a good dog bone, in my opinion, is something not so small it could be swallowed whole and something that will not splinter, splatter, or slime all over. [Here](https://www.chewy.com/bones-chews-made-in-usa-roasted/dp/114674?utm_source=partnerize&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=1011l93523&amp;utm_content=0&amp;clickref=1101lvVf2QE2&amp;utm_term=1101lvVf2QE2), [here](https://www.chewy.com/barkworthies-collagen-9-inch-braided/dp/330502), and [here](https://www.chewy.com/bones-chews-made-in-usa-cotton-rope/dp/114657) have all been big hits. 

My dog is also somewhat in love with [this dental toy](https://www.target.com/p/arm-38-hammer-treadz-gorilla-dental-dog-toy-l/-/A-80170251), of all things. You can smear peanut butter on it or in it and it must have a really satisfying mouth feel because he'll go at it for hours. Lasted six months so far with nearly daily use. I have to take it away afterwards or he will obsess (and probably destroy it). 

One other thing I've learned (the hard way), is if you have more than one dog you'll need more than one bone. Oh, and if this is an 'occupy the dog while on a phone call' sort of treat, make sure to take the bone back POLITELY afterwards or the next time you give it to him he'll go berserk.

His name was Clover.

A great wizard visited a friendly kingdom.  The King had a young jester in training named Zifnab.  He showed exceptional deceptive skills utilizing weak trinket type magic.   The Wizard met with Zifnab to ask him where he learned the trinket magic.  Zifnab said that he had read a book that taught him the basics and then he developed the magic on his own to suit his jester training.

The great wizard felt Zifnab had great potential and requested the king release Zifnab to him to enter training as an apprentice.    Zifnab was trained for years until one day his master died.   Zifnab was then on his own.

After years of solitary life, Zifnab decided he wanted an apprentice.   Given he lived a solitary life, he decided to summon an entity from the Shadow Plane and use his magic to shape him into what he wanted and to control him.

Zifnab enjoyed books and grew fond of the idea of Leprechauns and summoned a demon from the shadow plane and used magic to shape him into the look of a Leprechaun and named him Clover.  He hoped to have Clover as both a Wizard apprentice, but also a his jester.

Early in Clover's life, Zifnab didn't have any issues controlling Clover.  As Clovers grew into his training, he got stronger, so did his propensity to make play practical jokes.  Many times the jokes he played were mean spirited and often times, outright dangerous.

After a few years, Clover no longer wanted to be Zifnab's subject, so he tried to kill Zifnab.   A huge battle took place and Zifnab was finally able to force Clover back to the Shadow Plane, but the damage was already done.  Zifnab was dying.

Zifnab sealed Clover away and hid the book with the knowledge about how to summon him.

Two hundreds years later.  Zifnab's book was found and the young son of a local Baron decided to summon this Leprechaun Jester so that he could have his own magical subject.

So, now there is a very powerful evil Leprechaun who thinks he's funny (jester) running around the countryside.

I am new to darts aswell (3 months).

When I first started, hitting the 18 and 12 contributed a lot to my average score. As I get more accurate, I am hitting 20 more often, but a lot of those 18's and 12's are becoming 1's or 5's.

My dart average decreased for quite a while (seems to be flattening now). However, whilst my dart average was decreasing, I was hitting more 20's, 1's and 5's (and less 18 and 12s) - so my darts are getting closer to target and less darts are going wide. 

Once I start moving more of those 1s and 5s into the 20, my average should start increasing again.

Aiming for t19 would be the quickest way to increase my average (it's a more forgiving part of the board). But I prefer to keep plugging away at the t20.",1656633787

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","God, this is my worst fear about my current three year relationship. I think it became easier for him to just agree with me whenever I say I don't want kids, since he knew I would get upset and suggest that he find someone else if he does want kids down the road.

It was originally his goal to have a wife and kids, then it changed to ""whatever happens, happens."" When I brought up getting my tubes tied, he freaked out at first and bingoed me by saying ""my friends originally didn't want kids and now they have them,"" suggesting that I'd change my mind. He's also made comments about how his parents DEFINITELY want grandkids because he's an only child and ""the only one who can pass down the family name.""

Unfortunately, all those situations happened over a year ago and I didn't dig into it deeper into it at the time. Now he always tells me he doesn't want kids, but I can never tell if he's being honest or if he just wants to avoid conflict.",1656633787

‚Ä¢ Lineage: GSC x Larry OG

‚Ä¢ Bred by Sherbinskis x Humboldt

‚Ä¢ Cultivated by Prohibition Cultivation 

‚Ä¢ Sourced from Prohibition Farms 

‚Ä¢ üëÄ
‚Ä¢ Visuals - medium sized nicely trimmed buds are of a medium density with a slight squish and a slightly sticky exterior while inside they are perfectly sticky and greasy feeling. Made up of dark purple and black with hints of olive green and lighter purple throughout and plenty of wild looking long and thin reddish orange pistils that is all topped by a thick layer of frosty trichomes with tons of clear and amber outer heads still very visibly intact 

‚Ä¢ üëÉüëÖüî•
‚Ä¢ Smell/Taste/Burn - a nice gassy nose with a slightly sweet but more so peppered cookie type profile with a hint of citrus and once busted has some sour earthy terps and gas in the mix. The terps translate perfectly to a sweet, spicy and slightly funky cookie base that is nice and gassy and has the sour earthy terps coming through on the exhale with hints of citrus. Joint burn great and quickly build up a small oil ring while producing a clean white ash 

‚Ä¢ üí®
‚Ä¢ High - pretty evenly balanced from the start with a dreamy and euphoric head stone that quickly helps calm the mind and eliminate stress while coupled with instant relaxation from head to toe that increases gradually. Quite lazy but not exactly debilitating and for those with higher tolerance this one can be used during the day but I recommend it for late afternoon/evening use 

‚Ä¢ üéØ
‚Ä¢ Overall this is another one I always enjoy from PF and this batch was no different. Great looking bud that as usual from PF is heavily frosted in trichs, nice cookie terps that translate perfectly, clean and greasy burning to a white ash, and a well balanced high that is of medium/high potency",1656633787

"bulimia","t5_2tmc8","my ED is pretty bad and i've been suffering for many years with it, going on at least 7 years now. ive been binging about every other day for a couple weeks now. i dont want to binge but it is all i constantly think about. this is probably due to lack of food in my house and life stress. when i dont have access to regular meals, i go a bit nuts and get the urge to binge a lot. 

my craving for potato chips has been constant for years. no amount of just eating a regular portion, abstaining, or giving in, knocks out the cravings. in the past, ive managed to abstain for months and the cravings still never went away. 

it sort of seems like my ED has a mind of its own. during those months of abstaining, i would have days where the cravings were super intense, then days where i could distract myself from it. i think it has a lot to do with just having access to regular meals. 

my recommendations are, focus on eating regular, balanced meals. recently when i do have access to food for meals, it makes me feel so much clearer. i would even eat a meal if i wasn't necessarily ""hungry"". just toast and eggs for breakfast, even though im never hungry for it. im pretty sure i messed up my insulin resistance so my body isnt good at telling me when i truly need nutrients or not. it helps to just be able to eat regular meals.",1656633787

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","1) others have covered it. The 100 hours is there to give you time to learn the game.

2) farm them when you are able to. Or when you have no other choice. Most of the heroes you‚Äôve listed don‚Äôt want to farm neutrals until their nuke is maxed. Supports generally don‚Äôt farm neutrals and will only farm waves when no one else is around.

3) yes bring more regen out if you‚Äôre low. It‚Äôs generally a good idea to send out some extra regen the first time you use your courier. Also, hit them back with your own spells, poke them first. 

4) you don‚Äôt want to completely ignore the lane creeps but generally the later the game goes, the more you want to stick together. It‚Äôs very hard to win teamfights in dota when you have less heroes in the fight. If the wave is not an immediate threat to tower and your team is on the other side of the map, then you should be with your team.

when i was trying to grind out the main story quests on rise maybe about a month ago, i ended up messing up my wrist pretty bad playing on ps4 controller. i already had early signs of carpal tunnel before then, but playing mhr several hours throughout the day actually put me in a wrist splint. still wearing it now, and havent really opened up mhr in a while either. i really dont think using controller for this game is a good idea anymore lol, so im wondering if anyone who plays on m/kb can give me any advice, such as certain keybinds to change, etc etc.

for reference i play HH, i have a logitech MMO mouse (G604), and i am right handed. splint is on my right hand as well.",1656633788

If you can find places around to do a simple day hike, my husband takes my kids to different easy hikes and they call it ‚Äútraveling.‚Äù  The kids will ask him if they can ‚Äúgo traveling.‚Äù  He will take one kid or all 4, depending on who wants to go.  They pack a lunch from items we have at home. The only cost is the gas to get there. 

We also did a lot of camping when we lived around Salt Lake City, we knew the mountains well and there was a ton of free camping space.  You may have a friend or family member that could loan you a tent.  Even if it‚Äôs just ‚Äúcamping‚Äù in the backyard or the living room it‚Äôs a fun experience your child will remember fondly.  

I‚Äôve seen a lot more splash pads in surrounding cities and those are free and fun.  If your child attends school during the year you could ask the teacher to give your contact info to a friend of your child to set up play dates.",1656633788

"Gloomhaven","t5_3hpmt","The only enemies that can be damaged by the traps in that room are the bears, which could probably be done in one spot. The rest of the enemies have flying though, which means they cant trigger the traps. Also ranged attacks really fuck up the funneling strategy. Although getting the ranged enemies adjacent will block the bears atleast however they will fly away and let the bears forward, meaning that i would have to repeatedly hook them in and to do before the bears move in. Once the bears are in however they will be forced to stay at range and i wont be able to stop the bears. This scenario is grim lol",1656633788

"FantasyBookers","t5_2wgtc","Decline age varies by worker, it's something you can set when you create them, or have it be randomized. The good news is they start slow, so once the slide begins you have a bit of time to milk them before they really start to crash land. If the game is telling you Hogan's skills are on the decline, you likely will be penalized in match ratings for his age and having him as your champ is a gamble, though short term should be ok. Just be sure to use him to make your next guys up because he doesn't have much time left. As for product, if you are three years in you should be able to safely change it, but go slow. Changing the hardcore aim is going to fundamentally alter your booking and media opportunities, so cranking it way up out of the blue will rock the boat dangerously. You might see less advertising money, or an entertainer like Hogan might go from 85 to 75 in-ring performances overnight because the fans don't want to see that kind of worker as much.

I'm somewhat in the same situation and I can see it may seem like you aren't not improving and that you are slowing everyone downbut honestly that's overthinking for the most part.

And think it rationally: you are a valuable income for your dojo like everyone else, why would they kick you out?
Hell, probably an untalented guy is even better since that means you'll need more time training there than usual and that equals to more money for your sensei.

Buddha preached against caste system. So buddha was born more than 2000 years ago.

&gt;Caste privilege allows them to shield themselves of ugly realities and wont bother about being responsible

You are right. Which is why they are evil. 

MLK could enlighten white folks, who belong to a different race. But oppressor caste Hindus oppress own in India without any remorse for 2000+ years. Oppressor caste Hindus make white folks look like angels. There is no other religion in the world which institutionalizes oppression like Hinduism.

&amp;#x200B;

Colonialism saved India from clutches of evil oppressor caste Hindus. That is just a fact. It was purely because of colonialism that a dalit like Ambedkar was able to get an education against the wishes of oppressor caste Hindus. It was due to colonialism that Phule was able to get an education from the Scottish missionaries.  Phule went to educate other oppressed castes and even Brahmin women, against the wishes of oppressor caste Hindus.

Colonialism had positive outcome for India, having freed 100s of millions of oppressed caste Hindus and at least getting some reforms towards equality.",1656633790

"traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns","t5_2uog0","I had to answer questions to a trans-affirming medical practitioner in order to get HRT. Informed consent but still a barrier in place to make sure people didn't transition or start that didn't need to.

Initially ... I um ... lied? I didn't feel anything dysphoric, I was actually at the point of not feeling much of anything besides an amount of joy in presenting as a different gender online. I just knew common experiences for dysphoria and ... tailored my answer because I knew transitioning was something I wanted. Once on hormones ... yeah ... the dysphoria hit in equal measure with euphoria.

Now I'm not particularly recommending this, depending on your country the questions can be involved, and if you get caught in a lie it can be ... bad for you. But I was on deaths door, ready to knock hard and walk through, so I took a last ditch action that by all analysis seemed to be the correct course to at least try living a bit longer. My dysphoria was repressed along with my euphoria, I couldn't honestly answer why beyond 'I want to'. Turns out, I'd told myself 'I'm okay' when I wasn't enough times that needs became 'wants'. I didn't need to dress in womens' clothing and feel like a woman, I 'wanted' to. I didn't need to be gendered she/her, I 'wanted' to. I didn't need help when seriously injured, I *'wanted'* to.

What I've learned is sometimes we don't have answers until we take actions, sometimes we just have feelings we can't describe that sum up to what this image accurately describes until we begin taking the actions that give context to those feelings. We don't always ***know*** things, but we have to be prepared to admit we were wrong in the face of blind discovery just as much as we hope we're right. Sometimes we have to run before we can crawl, and that is just ... life. It's taking a risk to find happiness. 

For me, all I could truly explain if I dug deep down and tried, wasn't that transitioning gave me more, it's just that being as I was somehow ... maybe ... felt less?

Later, that flipped and I need to get new pills soon and if there's still an E shortage where I am I'm going to lose it.",1656633790

You definitely shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned that Brenda goes to church with you. It‚Äôs not remotely relevant and is not evidence of her being a good person. It‚Äôs just an unrelated fact, neither good nor bad (though most people here will take it as a mark against her). 

I really sympathize with you because I believe in the importance of family. My brother and I are very close because that‚Äôs just his personality, but we‚Äôve still gotten each other through some really horrific times, and I know he‚Äôll be there for me, albeit stoically, if I need him. I would be devastated to not have him, his wife, and their boys in my life. 

However, while I support your intentions, your approach was so wrong. 1) You shouldn‚Äôt have tried to have this conversation with him surrounded by family, 2) you should‚Äôve backed off when he got upset, 3) it sounds like you went right to ‚Äúyou need to reconcile‚Äù without asking *what* they need to reconcile. You‚Äôve never heard from him why he hates his sister. You owe that to him. 4) WTF is up with asking him to move home? It sucks that he lives far away, but lots of families do that for one reason or another. And he has a life there now, his wife has a life there. That‚Äôs an insane thing to suggest.",1656633791

For piranhas, I think it depends on your meta. If you go up against a lot of marines fusions are better.

With stealth suits, units can not do more than one action a turn. I suggested the cuts for points. If you were going Aerospace you should keep shield drones since they have to hang there asses out waiting for action to complete. RND complete at end of your turn so no need for shield drones to survive longer.

If you want more bodies for blocking, drop the piranhas and go for more kroot and kroot hounds if able. I think crisis loaded with burst and flamers don't give a lot of anti-tank support.

"DollarGeneral","t5_2xwae","1) Labor hours. 117 a week is not enough especially while the truck schedule is random. My store gets 2 dry trucks a week because its an old store and stock room is tiny. Lately they've come one right after the other. We are always in stock mode playing catch up with no time to do resets on time. The SM needs to be managing all of action items, fresh, vendors, resets, paperwork/admin plus stocking. My Lead Key and ASM are also getting burnt out. It is exhausting even with a great team. HATE Tuesdays. Just send us new strips every week or get shelf strips that are electronic and do price updates from corporate. We can hardly keep up with them and its going to get more ridiculous as inflation continues to climb.
 

2) Agee with most of the comments written already. Labor hours, 145 is the minimum that makes the store run well. We need to have 2 days off a week, actual holidays off (or PTO). Morale, doesn't corporate realize we all know they are off on all holidays and the fun cutesy videos actually do the opposite to morale? Keep fixing distribution. Give a fixed percent employee discount on every purchase. The 30 percent is a really good perk, but it would be nice to buy my daily (or twice daily) energy drink/lunch at a discount. Salary needs to be bumped up.

3) My team and community/regulars first. Love them. The products we sell (i know some will disagree) are actually decent and I find it super fun to see what new things we get. Wish more was made in America but no one has that anyway. I chose to leave a corporate job of 20 years and even my worst day at DG isn't near the worst in my old career.",1656633793

Nobody is arguing that swfs can't be annoying, not one person has said that.  And no, groups of friends in dbd aren't some magical entity that's so much more oppressive than other games.  If anything they're less oppressive than shooters with clear objectives.  4 people rolling up on B as a coordinated group is a lot harder to deal with than 4 people that still have to operate efficiently and independently like in dbd, in dbd one weak link can easily drag the entire team down while in competitive games like shooters or LoL someone else can pick up slack while the weak link gets their shit together.   Some of the craziest shit I've faced up against as killer has been against solo or duo players.  People at the top tier of DBD need zero communication because 4 top tier players know what needs to be done and can act independently.

Once it's empty check the tank again. Fill with new fuel, replace the fuel filter, and see if it runs.

But it's nonsensical to expect other ex-soviet countries to be off-limits to NATO troops, since the USSR dissolved without any such foreign troop treaties or laws, and absolutely crazy to expect countries that were never soviet, like Sweden and Finland, to be off-limits.  If Russia wants a guarantee that weapons and troops will stay a certain distance away from Moscow, it should offer concessions in return.

I try to find my identity and culture among the people I was born and grew up with. I feel DNA is such a small part of what makes us, us.

(Also, afaik, we did evolve from fish, so who gets to say your beliefs are wrong :p it doesn't seem so far fetched that some human groups evolved independently, not when so many other species seem to have done so. this is totally a side note, but sometimes we can be so focused on Euro-centric science that we forget that other people have been existing in this land perfectly well way before the settlers came)",1656633795

The previous mayor Dee Margo is a well known Republican who used to be a state representative. They've all taken votes on items for or against in tandem.

City representatives can't vote raises for themselves. The city charter has to be amended first and that is by voter approval only. They can vote to give the city manager a raise though, which is causing controversy.

I work downtown and I've walked a plenty. Being a lifer here in El Paso has shown tremendous improvements than how it was decades ago. So the city has definitely changed. I don't necessarily agree with everything they've voted for or against, but expecting my rep to vote exactly how I want every time is foolhardy.

I'm just glad city elections are nonpartisan because then hyperpartisan fanatics like yourself would just vote for the party instead of ideas.

"3d6","t5_2wkux","I just finished a campaign as a stars 11/twilight 1 and it was fantastic. I definitely felt the loss of access to 6th level spells until the very end. However, the extra utility the cleric dip provided more than made up for it. Super dark vision for the party was a tremendous help. Loading up healing word, sanctuary, etc with cleric slots freed me up to take more situational Druid spells that I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have prepared. And the extra cantrips (toll the dead, sacred flame, word of radiance) meant that I had an optimal cantrip no matter what the enemy was and could conserve spell slots better. My guess is that your party comp should really drive the decision. Also I didn‚Äôt take the dip until later, prob around level 8 or so if you‚Äôre stuck at lower levels it might be better to hold off",1656633798

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","&gt; diferen√ßa entre Bolsonaro e Mussolini √© o n√≠vel de poder que cada um conseguiu pra implantar as barb√°ries que defendem. Seu modus operandi, entretanto, √© frente e verso o manual dos fascistinhas. Voc√™ pode at√© falar que ele √© neofascista, mas isso a√≠ √© um debate um tanto quanto vazio

Voc√™ n√£o mostrou que o Bolsonaro √© fascista segundo as defini√ß√µes mais cl√°ssicas de fascismo. Modus operandi e semelhan√ßas n√£o significa muita coisa.


&gt; Por causa dos irm√£os nazistas que se auto-declaravam socialistas? Lol. Voc√™ t√° equivalendo duas coisas que, historicamente, s√£o incompar√°veis. o n√≠vel de apoio que os liberais historicamente deram aos fascistas √© diametralmente oposto aos posicionamentos dos socialistas, que sempre foram alvos de ataque da ideologia fascista

Ent√£o o fato de liberais n√£o terem sido perseguidos por nazistas significa que liberais apoiavam nazistas?

Se for assim voc√™ pode falar que qualquer grupo que n√£o foi atacado por nazistas √© apoiador de fascistas.


&gt; Quem derrotou o fascismo foi a Uni√£o Sovi√©tica. O ocidente estava apoiando o Hitler pra sair na porrada com Stalin at√© que Hitler decidiu atacar eles.

N√£o. A Blitz a√©rea da Alemanha na Inglaterra come√ßou em 1940, a opera√ß√£o Barbarossa foi de 1941.

A pol√≠tica de concilia√ß√£o da Inglaterra com a Alemanha foi por ningu√©m querer come√ßar uma guerra mundial d√©cadas depois da primeira.

Os EUA nunca quiseram se envolver em guerras na Europa, era a pol√≠tica deles at√© a Guerra Fria. A Doutrina Monroe previa justamente isso.

E n√£o, a Uni√£o Sovi√©tica n√£o derrotou o fascismo.

&gt; Muita roupagem bonitinha pra falar que liberal apoia fascista.

Arrow √© um ganhador do Nobel. N√£o √© roupagem bonitinha, e sim pura ci√™ncia.

A n√£o ser que voc√™ negue a ci√™ncia, o teorema de Arrow √© uma das teorias importantes sobre decis√µes coletivas.",1656633798

My bet is that Christ will return when at least some of mankind has learned what Christ tried to teach. So far, I don't thing any of us fully understand (especially the part about not judging others). Just my 2 cents. Nobody knows &amp; everybody should be ready for Christ's return.",1656633799

"shittyrainbow6","t5_3h1lw","Given that the current R6 timeline takes place in like 2025 I think it's fair to say they just fell to massive obscurity after Bartlett or were wiped out entirely by Team Rainbow. Kinda sucks they were just written out in such a shitty way like that but given that it's been ten years in universe and the current plot line there probably wasn't a good way to keep them in the story and relevant.

As for Six lore wise it's explained she resigned her post and took a job as secretary of state under the President leaving Harry as next in line who up to that point worked under her as a psychoanalyst.

IRL wise I think it's just that Ubisoft either couldn't get/the actress simply didn't want to return to roll. This is evident by her literary never appearing once in any post-launch content or advertising at all. She was only doing the roll during the game's initial development and then dipped before Operation Black Ice.",1656633799
"philadelphia","t5_2qh24","I don't drink Philly tap water untreated. It tastes nasty. I have a counter top filter system, a Multipure, that was well worth the expense. (I think when I got it a few years ago it was $300, plus I buy the removable filter for it each year, which is $85). Previously, I used another cheaper filter but I had a lot of problems with it.  I read a lot of things over the years about Philly water and they weren't good, but whenever I mention it to someone, they say ""no, Philly water is great"". So I expect to get downvoted and a bunch of folks will post that it's great.",1656633799

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Whatever the matter with the transcripts (never heard of the guy before I saw this video), I think he raises very important questions, about how corporations and corporate systems will be allowed to steer the discourse, for instance.

But from this video alone, he doesn't seem to make any outrageous claims. He's totally open with that it's his definitions that differ from the other people he mentioned, and he says there's no disagreement regarding the scientific facts. And he very rightly points out that we don't really have a very developed language with which to talk about sentience or consciousness.",1656633799
