What if the music evolved as the story did? It would be kind of cool to do a song where the form was more of a story-esque arc that started off in one place and then went from there - less of an AABAAB form, and more of a musical journey, somehow. 

Some songs by Tenacious D does something similar to what I have in mind; specifically songs like Kielbasa and Tribute, songs that never quite return to their starting points.

To be fair she has this coat she was wearing that she loves because she found it on sale and us so warm. It's thick wool, long and kind of a grungy green. Any ways she was sooo upset. A real blow to her confidence. If she weren't such a sweet polite woman she would probably have told then to fuck off. End of story: she kept the dollar. ","1375315209"

It could also run dungeon defenders, and that's a pretty demanding game.

Obviously more power than a phone, but I assumed the phone would just run the game really badly and get really hot. And then I realised he couldn't possibly be emulating them because Borderlands 2.

&gt;you can be assumed to not ever be fully able to consent.

Absolutely.  The report noted (and I quoted) that *all* sexual contact between prisoners and guards is illegal and viewed as staff misconduct for that very reason. 

However, I'm talking about willing vs unwilling sexual contact, which is an important distinction despite the fact that no legal consent can actually be given.  Would you deny that a a 17 year old kid who wants to and willingly has sex with his 25 year old teacher would be much less traumatized than a 17 year old who was forced to have sex with his 25 year old teacher?  Both cases are very illegal, but the distinction is important for the minors.

The survey questions very clearly lay out descriptions of unwilling sexual contact through threat, intimidation, coercion and bribes.  Do you think that the inmates are unable to distinguish between unwilling and willing sexual contact?

&gt;Was that not obvious?

It was somewhat muddled by the fact that I had already acknowledged that all sexual contact between inmates and guards is illegal, and thus you were taking swipes at air.  I tried to clear up the comment in case you actually had a valid point I hadn't already made.","1375315214"

&gt;Cat-facing is a physiological disorder of tomatoes. Cat-face originates in the early stages of flower bud development and is the result of abnormal development of plant tissue between the style and ovary which results in misshapen fruit. Other impediments to flower bud development can also result in cat-facing. The syndrome is related to unfavorable growing conditions, in particular several days below 60 F when the plants are young. High levels of soil nitrogen and excessive pruning aggravate the problem. Accidental exposure to phenoxy herbicides can also lead to malformed fruit. Cat face is more prevalent on large-fruited, fresh market tomato varieties. Good growing practices, especially temperature control, should be followed in greenhouse production of field transplants. Excess nitrogen, aggressive pruning, and accidental exposure to hormonal herbicides should be avoided.&gt;[source](http://extension.umass.edu/vegetable/diseases/tomato-cat-facing)","1375315216"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Or perhaps that they're actually mature minded and are thinking towards reformation instead of punishment? 

Essentially sending someone to ""prison"" doesn't rehabilitate them, they're forced into an environment where they're up against even worse examples of the crimes they're guilty of and they end up being much more horrible than they were before. Once they get out they're still the same person and end up in the same routine as they were before they ended up in jail. 

Reformation and rehabilitation is the idea that you provide prisoners with the tools for their own liberation, that given a skill set and ethic that allows them to function without resorting to crime they can provide for themselves a lifestyle which will be much more effective in preventing them from being repeat offenders.

&gt;My reaction to that? The fact that they ruled out the prisoners' island as a solution says to me that they don't have the balls to actually solve the problem of toxic online communities because they're too optimistic and have too much faith in the good in people because they think the other person is too shit to treat like a normal person and deserving of toxicity.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","&gt; ""1. Their system is closed.""

Yep. That's their philosophy. Why?.. because controlling EVERY aspect entirely END-to-END means they can ensure tight integration and reliability. Example:... When you wipe the hard drive on a Mac and reinstall the OS... YOU'RE DONE. You don't have to hunt for Drivers. You don't have to worry that some component won't work. It's all tightly integrated and built into the OS. DONE. Awesome. 

&gt; ""Software and hardware are hard to work around on all devices.""

Not sure what you mean by this. Apple devices work well with other Apple devices. The end-to-end integration makes it all work seamlessly together. That's the beauty of it. 

&gt; ""2. Their products are overpriced. I know that a lot goes into the design work, but the manufacturing process is quite cheap. Their profit margins per unit sold are incredible.""

Guess it all depends on what you (personally) value. I've had many Apple products over the past 5+ years and they are all still working beautifully. Performance, Dependability and beautiful hardware. Worth every penny. 

&gt; ""3. It costs more to repair a product than to get a new one.""

If it's under warranty.. it costs you nothing. If it's NOT under warranty, you take it to an Apple Store and get a quote. Pretty straightforward. I've worked in the PC/Windows Support business for about 20 years.. and I'd rather deal with Apple repairs any day of the week than fight DELL or Microsoft or HP or Toshiba,etc. Nightmares, ugh. 

&gt; ""4. It's very, very easy for Apple products to break.""

Not sure why you think this. I've got a 2007 Mac Mini that's still running strong. Still got my original iPhone 3G running great. iPhone4 still running great. 2007 Macbook still running great. If you take care of your equipment (no matter what brand it is).. it works great. 

&gt; ""5. The manufacturing process doesn't benefit Americans at all, neither is it ethical to work the way Apple factory jobs work.""

Which is true of EVERY technology manufacturer who outsources to China,etc. Why single out Apple ?... 

&gt; ""6. Apple is putting nothing back into the community.""

They make great products that have historically been aimed mostly at Education and Home.... What's not to like about that ?... 

&gt; ""7. Apple isn't as innovative as the hype says.""

Throughout Apple's entire history they've done things differently than the typical generic white-box PC. How is that NOT ""innovative"" ?.... 

&gt; ""The iPhone was the only thing since vintage Apple, and the first was an unfinished product. Flaws galore.""

You do realize that Apple's design philosophy is to ""start simple"" and iterate &amp; refine to improve the product,... right?... (opposite of approaches like Microsoft that tries to launch a product with 300 features that don't reliably work)

&gt; ""8. Apple rejects innovations from its community to put out its own stuff first, even if it isn't as good. eg. The Google Maps fiasco a while ago.""

I'm not even sure what this means. What ""Google Maps fiasco"" are you talking about?... When they changed from Google Maps to Apple Maps?.. that was a fiasco?.. Wow.. you have low standards for the definition of ""fiasco"". 

&gt; ""9. The hype and rumors are unprecedented.""

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","&gt;&gt; Pregnancy is - statistically - very safe

&gt; No, it's not at all. Especially not in the 3rd world... due to VERY high maternal death rates. 

Ok, let's do the maths: [according to the WHO](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/), 800 women a day die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications.  That works out at 292,000 per year.

The [world birth rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate) is 19.15/1000 people per year, or (given 7 billion people in the world) 134,050,000 births per year.

If we're charitable and assume the births that lead to maternal deaths are even included in that ""total births"" figure, that means that *even including third-world countries*, the percentage of births that result in maternal deaths is just 0.2%.  That's 1 in 500.

Now don't get me wrong - that's still too high, and we should still be doing everything we can to bring it down, but in terms of mortality rate it's comparable to [taking up hang-gliding](http://www.healthymaniswhatiam.com/health/your-chance-of-dying-from-various-sports/) (1 in 560 chance of death), and people do that for *fun*.

You need to have *five* kids before your chance of dying in childbirth is even comparable to [your chance or dying in a car accident](http://www.livescience.com/3780-odds-dying.html) (1 in 100), but I don't see you posting long effortposts about safe driving or extreme sports.

Don't get me wrong here - I'm not arguing pregnancy-related mortality isn't a serious problem, and I'm not arguing more shouldn't be done about it.

I *am* arguing, however, that you've chosen a spectacularly bad opportunity to try to push your particular agenda on the issue, and that compared to things *many people do all day every day without even thinking, and for far less reason, reward or benefit*, pregnancy is actually *comparatively* safe.

Not *absolutely* safe, but well within the bounds of what normal, reasonable people are happy to risk without batting an eyelid or even thinking twice about the risks.

&gt; What I'm saying here is not irrelevant, because if hijacking and ""hacking"" something that exists mechanistically within women causes as many side effects as it does, then the notion that a male pill will be around any time soon seems dimmer still.

FWIW I think you're now arguing the same point as me, but choosing to phase it differently.

I'm saying ""the female pill's mechanism is comparatively simple and safe compared to proposed male pills, which is why male pills are not yet available"", whereas you're saying ""female pills and pregnancy are potentially hideously dangerous and scary, and hence male pills are *even more* potentially hideously dangerous and scary, which is why male pills are not yet available"".

The thing is, my comment is a *relative* one, so there's no actual point of contention between our positions at all.","1375315217"

Other areas they win at: You can bring in dogs, have a pint, play games (they do trivia and euchre nights), and most of their staff is cool.

Add that to online demos and sound clips and you can make a better decision looking for stuff. Maybe know what kinda sound you're after, the budget etc (cheap, mid budget like Barber, expensive like Wampler, shit expensive like I won't even mention), then you're all set.

"Ubuntu","t5_2qh62","This is not a phone that is being marketed at the masses nor is it a phone being marketed at those who don't want to give up 800$ all at once, it was compared to F1 racing. I fully understand the lack of lower price points below the cost of a phone as well. They said this is an opportunity for those with in the community who want to buy a low production extremely high quality device developed by Canonical that showcases the cutting edge of the proposed software and hardware abilities. They set the number at right around 40,000 for the production run and that's been the goal all along to sell a year in advance around 40,000 phones. The $20 dollar level which is essentially a minimum donation to the cause is a nice treat at a low cost for those who want to see this technology get pushed but can't afford this device, but I think it still misses the point of the campaign. If there are 40,000, well now more than 40,000 due to the new price points, people who want to get a limited quantity phone at a high cost then Canonical will create that device if not they will continue to work on the software so it can be placed on production model phones in the future. If you can't afford 800 for limited production phone than this campaign isn't for you, in the same way if Apple made a limited edition Iphone5 you and I probably couldn't afford it. 

If it was a $600 phone it would be a different story, but for $800 it's a hard pill to swallow especially this early in advance. 

I also think we will see Ubuntu Phone/Ubuntu for Android available for purchase on a device in the coming year or two just that it will come from a large manufacturer who uses an already existing android phone production line and then loading the software on to it. That's really where Canonicals goals are with Ubuntu not in a low production high cost device.","1375315220"

"Explainlikeimscared","t5_2xiog","Starting a blog is easy: you pick a free hosting platform, pick a username and blog name, sign up for an account, and write. Google around for lists of writing prompts or questions if you feel like you don't know what to write about, and if you write every day for long enough, your brain will start organizing your thoughts into the form of posts habitually.


To get around your insecurity, you might want to publish your first blog under a false identity -- possibly even an identity who has interests that you don't fully agree with. That way you can practice your writing skills without feeling like any criticism of your writing is criticizing you as a person. If it's well-received, you can connect the blog with your ""real"" self later on. If people don't like it much, you'll at least know that nobody you respect will ever know about it, and so it can't change their opinions of you.

So, starting just any old blog is pretty straightforward. All the paraphernalia of ""successful"" blogging is what's difficult to get: followers, ad revenue, good discussions in the comments, and so on. If you want lots of followers, it'd probably be helpful to focus your main blog on an interesting topic and then tactfully distribute links to your posts in forums related to that topic.

(Of less relevance to Judaism, there is a huge number of parallels and references to the Old Testament in the New Testament, and you need to know your Old Testament well to understand the depth of the symbolism in the new). Of course there is also a strong reliance on tradition to understand some of the nuances as well. A little more trippy is that post-Jesus development of Judaic tradition has a lot of meaning when Christians see it (for example, some of the changes to the Passover meal a few centuries after Christianity first emerged, like the breaking of the middle matzoh). I guess it's to be expected between two religions that share such a large common history.

Yes.

&gt;I don't accept the premise that raising minimum wage necessarily results in a loss of employment.

Then you are laboring under a misconception. Businesses do not employ a magical number of persons and then say ""OK we're done."" They hire the amount of persons they can afford to pay. If you raise the minimum amount someone can be paid you are necessarily causing people on the low end to loose jobs and preventing people who are not yet employed from getting jobs.

They DO instigate play with me, leg jumps and such, but its just that Arlo (neighbor pet) really loves to. He is a happy, healthy guy that is totally cool without a buddy.

[Prohibition and Public Health By HAVEN EMERSON, M.D. (1932)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/TheSurvey-1928dec01/15-19/)

and the relevant charts with the data

http://puu.sh/3QDSv.png

The solid line is population while the dotted line is death from alcoholism. See the steady incline as a result of population growth. Notice between 1915 and 1920 you see a decline in alcoholism anyway. Note the rapid incline immediately after prohibition begins and during the prohibition years.

http://puu.sh/3QDQh.png

Again, this one just shows the same thing but with cirrhosis related deaths as well. Plus it breaks the chart into 3 groups (pre-prohibition, war-time, and prohibition) making it easier to see the decline then rise in the chart.

http://puu.sh/3QDTJ.png
http://puu.sh/3QDTU.png

These two charts highlight a decrease in deaths by alcoholism during prohibition years. This ones the one that will trip you up if you don't realize what's happening. The declines are the results of the previous years sharp declines not the same years because alcoholism itself was actually increasing during most of those years. Combine that with people not wanting to incriminate themselves for breaking the law and it's easy to get skewed results. There's probably something to say about the states these surveys were taken from in regard to prohibition as well but we hardly need to go farther to prove the point. The fact remains clear that prohibition isn't what caused a decline in death rates, alcoholism had already hit an all time low leading up to the beginning of prohibition. Prohibition managed to happen during years where death rates were going to be low anyway due to unattributed factors and this is used as an opportunity to spin the positive effects as being due to Prohibition. Meanwhile alcoholism is actually on the rise as a result of prohibition.

So now tell me what you believe based on the same evidence. Was it actually how Mr. Moore says it was, or was there more to it than that?","1375315229"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","**Olenna Tyrell defeats Littlefinger**

The white weirwood door of the High Hall opened with a sudden creak. Two tall guards strode into the hall, flanking the aisle, identical in height and clad in identical arms, armour, and surcoats. *Green*, Sansa observed, *green with gold roses*. *Could it really be....it is...*

Olenna Tyrell entered the room, her servants following close behind. Sansa looked up to weirwood seat of House Arryn, and observed Littlefinger as he stood up and then walked down the few steps that lay before it. Sansa was used to visitors...but the Queen of Thorns? It was like a ghost of her days of court, come back to visit her...

""My lady,"" Petyr said with a wry smile, ""you are most welcome at the Vale of Arryn...""

""Vale of Arryn, is it? I see no Arryns. Tell me, are they hiding behind the drapes, hmm? Perhaps under the carpet?"" The Queen of Thorns was clearly as prickly as ever.

""Our young Robert is taking a nap, my lady, please forgive his absence. As Lord Protector of the Vale, I give you his welcome. We so seldom have guests this high up in the sky.""

""So I noticed, Lord Baelish. I had to ride up in a cage to get here. I felt more like a bird than a rose."" Sansa noticed the old woman shift her gaze from Petyr to her.

""Sansa, is that truly you? Of course it is, my dear. I hope this man has been treating you well; I've heard it can get awfully cold and lonely up here in the Eyrie. Tell me, where are the lords and knights of the Vale?""

""My lord has been treating me very well, like his own daughter. Our bannermen are off on a foray against the Mountain Clans."" Sansa had been instructed to say those words to any questioning guest. In truth, the lords and knights of the Vale were off in their holdfasts, plotting - but none could outwit Littlefinger, she suspected. 

Lady Olenna turned to her retinue, for a brief moment. ""Leave me"", she said ""Not you two, Left and Right. You two will stay.""

""You won't be needing guards here, my lady"", Lord Baelish assured her.

""Perhaps not, but I am quite fond of my two men. As you say, though. Left and Right, stand outside the hall."" Sansa remembered them from King's Landing as well. Erryk and Arryk they were named, or Left and Right, as the Queen of Thorns called them. They stood at attention, their hands on the hilts of their swords, and then turned and marched out, their steps falling in perfect unison.


""Sansa, my dear, should you be here&gt;"", Olenna asked, but Littlefinger answered for her. ""You can speak freely in front of her. Now, tell me, Lady Tyrell, what do you think of the Vale, and this , well, *stout* castle.""

""We can beat around the bush all day, Lord Baelish, and all we will have to show for it is a ragged shrub. I won't prevaricate. I've come for Lady Sansa.""

*Me?* Sansa thought. *What could she want of me?*

""I'm sorry, I do not understand"", Littlefinger replied.

""What is there to understand? I am asking for Sansa. My granddaughter is the Queen, you know, and my son, Lord Puff Fish, the hand.""

""I'm afraid that...""

""There's no need to be afraid, Baelish, unless you plan on doing something rash. Sansa is to marry my grandson Willas. We arranged this quite some time ago, though we never got 'round to it. Tell him, my dear.""

*Willas? But that was ages ago?* ""It is true"", Sansa muttered, confused. She did not know quite what was going on. ""I was to marry Willas...but then...""

Baelish took up her sentence. ""But then the Lannisters married you to the Imp. So that...""

""That they did, Lord Protector of the Vale."" Littlefinger looked sour. He did not like to be interrupted. ""Well, the Imp has agreed to annul his marriage, and will allow my grandson to wed the Lady Stark, as was planned. Now that his lord father is dead, he feels ""emboldened"", as he put it. He seems to have grown quite friendly with Garlan, and it was them who made the deal. The fact that Garlan saved his skin by slaying that brute of a man known as the Mountain certainly didn't hurt.""

""Arrangements have been made, I'm afraid."" Littlefinger rarely seemed angry. This was one of those rare occasions.

""And arrangements can be broken, or have you missed what I just said?""

""I will not just give you Sansa...""

""Who said anything about giving? Surely Sansa can decide for herself.""

""I am her uncle, by marriage. I am Lord Protector of the Vale.""

""Ah, yes, Lord Protector of the Vale. How the small have risen. But just look what a state the Vale is in - it is no secret that your lords bannermen plot behind your back. They don't take kindly to being ordered about by an upjumped jackanape such as yourself. All the meanwhile, the Mountain Clans raid all along the roads. You have no army, my Lord.""

""I have gold."" All of Littlefinger's courtesies were gone now. ""Gold buys...""

""Men, yes. Tyrion Lannister figured that out. His father made him Master of Coin in your stead, before he was taken by illness, don't you recall?""

""Yes, I recall, I was there when it occurred.""

""You do think we are all simpletons, don't you? To you, we are all just Moon Boys with grand titles and names older than that of your own. Well, your replacement figured out your scheme. How many gold dragons did you leave the realm in debt? Six million dragons, was it? Or eight?""

""The Kings spent the coins, I only found them.""

""Oh yes, and no doubt Robert and Joffrey were stupid enough to let you *find them*. Cersei too, as long as you borrowed from her lord father. Well, Highgarden's vaults aren't quite so deep as those of Casterly Rock, and we keep track of our coin. For the throne to be in so much debt, Robert and Joffrey would have had to be staging tournaments every few months. My son, the hand, may be an oaf, but when Tyrion brought him those ledgers and his maesters looked them over, he was certainly none too pleased with what he saw. Your scam has come to an end.""

""You seem to forget, Tyrell, this is *my* castle.""

""The Eyrie is yours, is it? Like Harrenhal? I thought this was the Arryn's seat? And I'm sure my son will find Harrenhal a new owner. Perhaps a Frey. Lord Walder has more sons than a stray dog, no doubt one of them will jump at the opportunity to hold that cursed heap of stone.""

""I will not let you leave with Sansa. Guards!"" Sansa looked at the door, but no one came. ""Guards!""

Sansa gasped...

""By now, I suspect that Left and Right have taken care of your guards. Them, and the rest of my retinue.""

""How could it be? You only had two dozen men?"" Sansa heard herself say.

""Did I?"" The Queen of Thorns was smiling, Sansa could see. ""Who told you that? Those knights in charge of those little keeps that guard the path up the mountain to this hovel of yours? Sellswords, more like."" She turned back to Littlefinger. ""You of all people should know that sellswords can be bought. Oh, but you never imagined that someone would match your price. As Master of Coin, you controlled the the four Keepers of the Keys, the King's Counter, the King's Scales, and the Royal Mints. Not to mention that half the tax-collecters, harbormasters, and customs sergeants in the realm were in your pay. Well, the Mint of Lannisport was easy to get control of, as was the Mint of Oldtown. Gulltown was another matter, of course. That is, it was another matter until the Lords of the Vale - Royce, Caron, the whole lot - decided that it was time to end this show of yours. Oh, did I forget to mention -  their armies are surrounding the Giant's Lance. I should imagine that they have stationed archers and billmen in every pass by know. Those Mountain Savages that the Imp knew were certainly useful at ""preventing"" your scouts from reporting our advances. Them and that Lord Bronn of his... he originally wanted to assault this place with climbing spikes, like some wildling raider."" 

""Now who are you calling a wilding"". The door swung open again, and in stepped a cluster of Tyrell men-at-arms, but leading them was a grizzled man in a shirt of ringmail, his right hand resting casually on the hilt of his sword. He too Sansa recognized from King's Landing. ""Last time I was here, some old knight tried to kill me This time, it was half a dozen guards. It seems this place doesn't like me much. Oh, Lord Baelish, I was instructed by my patron to give you this message: 'A Lannister always pays his debts,' he said. There was something about a dagger, too, but I can't quite recall what it was.""

The Queen of Thorns stepped forth.

""Sansa, my dear, I think you'll be coming with me know. You too, Littlefinger. I trust you won't mind a few chains?""","1375315230"

"ClopClop","t5_2skff","&gt;Do you like real live ponies, or only cartoon ones made to look human?

The cartoon kind exclusively (non-anthro). As for real life, I grew up with my family owning a stable and after years of shoveling horse shit I can say with certainty I have no interest in performing anything sexual with actual mares, stallions, or geldings, although I recognize not everyone necessarily shares my position.
&gt;How did you get into this ""fetish""?

I saw images of cartoon my little ponies depicted with sexual organs doing erotic things, and it aroused me. I then got a boner and proceeded to masturbate. This is the intended trajectory of internet porn. 

&gt;Was it related to watching MLP as a kid? 

What, you mean the show that played in the 80s and 90s? I think my sister watched it sometimes but I never really saw it.

&gt;do you feel the show is in itself specialized to a certain degree and has in a way guided you into this subreddit and love of MLP erotica? 

I don't think the writers or artists ever intended for me to masturbate to their creations, no. If that's what you mean.

&gt;Is the MLP fan base really ripe with people who find the characters at least sexually arousing?

I don't think anyone here is qualified to answer this because we are all limited to our own personal experiences. But from my own interactions, more often than not, most adult fans (be they male or female) find at least one character in the show appealing in the same way they would as if the character were entirely human. Whether this is strictly platonic or romantic or even sexual, is entirely dependent on the individual (beauty, eye of the beholder, etc.). 

I find it fascinating and I believe this says a lot about our mate selection process, and how our social wiring (e.g. mirror neurons) is 'tricked' in media from certain cues that results in us having fondness for fictional characters, and in some cases extreme fondness or attraction. It's interesting that characteristics like certain personality traits, ""cute"" features, etc. can elicit emotions within us from characters who aren't even human. What was the question again? I dunno, probably. It's hard to keep yourself from jacking off when you see Twilight Sparkles ass.

&gt;Any other information on how you learned you liked this sort of stuff.

I first saw it on 4chan, like all extremely questionable pornography you'd off yourself if a family member found it on your computer. But that wasn't really where it started, since feral furry porn was always hot to me. I used to go to a website callled yiffstar a lot when I was younger and look at the porn and read the erotica section for it. Later on /v/ introduced me to kemono loli and shota and after a few years of jerking off to that, the step towards Pony porn was only natural, especially since a lot of kemo pixiv artists starting drawing it. I'm not really sure what else to put here. People say the internet (namely 4chan) erode away at sexual normality but I don't think that's very true, I think we have the bizarre sexual or otherwise inclinations we have to begin with and we only discover them since the internet exposes us to things we just never knew we liked before. Kind of like a Russian KGB sleeper agent in the cold war hearing the code word that activates them and then they kill their maid or something.","1375315230"

Okay, to that end you're totally correct. The OP's investment might have been wasted when it comes to secure communications, but personally I thought we were talking about the concepts here. The ""data transferred"" part of the question had me thinking too deeply about what he meant, I guess.

First off, there's the idea of *headroom*, the space between the top of the subject's head and the top of the frame. Right now, that space is about equal with the distance between the subject's chin and the bottom of the frame, you want that space above the subject's head to be smaller, so that the subject's eyes are about a third down in the frame.

Second, you want the subject to be looking *into* the frame, in this case, place the subject on the left side of the frame, so he's looking into the empty space. That space on the left behind his head is wasted, you want to avoid that.

There will be a gap that you need to get across, so instead of searching the environment, looking for things to use, you'll turn around and, oh, WOW, guess what? They'll be a GIANT plank of wood RIGHT THERE behind you for you to use. And you know the odd part? It looks exactly the same as every other plank of wood you used before it. Apparently there are just loads of massive planks of wood that are sturdy (not rotting or anything), look the same and are brilliant for getting across big gaps. How, uh, coincidental.
And I thought that this was a survival horror game? Then why are there well placed ladders and planks of wood everywhere you go? Where the hell is the surviving? How come Joel never has to go into a house and use his brain and pull out a table or a bed or a fridge and use that to climb up somewhere? What I'm saying is there is zero innovation or invention here. Nothing even remotely unique. It's bland. It's pointless. It's totally lame. And the game never seems excited about any of it either.

"tolkienfans","t5_2r6jm","&gt; Fist of all: I think it is madness (if not impossible) to make movie adaptations of Tolkien's books that stay true to the essence and nature of Tolkien, therefore this should never be expected by fans of his works.

I disagree; certainly it is possible to make excellent films that are more true to Tolkien's work than Jackson's. Indeed, in many ways Ralph Bakshi's much-maligned version was truer to Tolkien, despite its obvious other flaws.

Really, there's nothing *that* special about Tolkien's themes; they are commonplace in many films. They may tend to be neglected in action-adventure films, but then, *The Lord of the Rings* is not an action-adventure novel.

&gt; I think the movies of LotR are the best movies ever made.

That's an awfully high standard to hold them to. As adaptations, they are terrible, and even if you can somehow forget the source material, they're not, IMHO, particularly good *as films*. They have their good points — the look and feel, and the score, and some of the casting — but I can think of lots better films, even within the genre.","1375315244"

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","this is kind of me, and i have felt this way in the past, the reason being that i know i and probably a lot of women, we grow up with a lot more female relationships than male relationships, when i was younger boys were always a bit of a mystery to me, going out with them, having sex with them, there's always a bit lost in translation, a bit of a hurdle. but girls? i've had some of my girlfriends since first grade i get them much more easily and especially when i was younger i found them much more relatable. 

as a bisexual person, it was easier for me to just act straight, cause why not? i'm not going to have a big dramatic, tearful coming out to my grandparents  and then go date a boy. i like girls in general but i'm not promiscuous by my nature and i've never met a lady who i clicked with in a way that made me think ""girlfriend material"". so it never came up and it's not something that i feel the need to flaunt, but that doesn't mean it's off the table!

but a few years down the road, if i break up with my boyfriend i could very well see myself looking back over my relationships and being like, ""i should try dating women"" and maybe it would be a good thing for me!

nonetheless, if you ""suck at dating guys"" you probably suck at dating everyone, and need to examine more than just your sexual preference.       ","1375315246"

I'm not just making that up, [here's the link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaywalking), check for yourself

&gt;Also, I was focusing on the correct part of the quote. 

No you were not, the quote was ""illegal or reckless crossing of the road,"" you quote-mined the ""reckless crossing of the road"" fragment when it continued on to give examples, specifically the one I used.

&gt;It doesn't matter that it originated in the US. We know it's illegal, so what descriptor does that leave us with? Reckless.

The law for jaywalking defines specific circumstances of a pedestrian crossing the road that are illegal as well as the blanket term ""reckless crossing of the road"" in order to encompass more than the finite number of circumstances listed, the example I gave is one of the former. 

&gt;Again, you are arguing against yourself and constructing a rare scenario ...

You *asked* me to construct a scenario, this argument stemmed from me originally claiming that just because something is against the law does not mean it is intrinsically dangerous/wrong and you challenged that, I provided an example of a illegal act (jaywalking) that is not dangerous in order to demonstrate my point. 

&gt;... in order to make jaywalking seem totally safe and okay.

I agree.  It's disturbing for atheists to make common cause with christian islamophobes.  I've seen Dinesh D'Sousa try (and get away with) this in debates.  He'll make some slam against Muslims and get his Atheist debate partner (in this case, Hitchens) to go along with it. It's ridiculous.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali is an out Atheist, but because she's so virulently anti-muslim (and I don't blame her), she finds a nice home at the conservative, not-at-all-atheist American Enterprise Institute (which I do kind of blame her for).

It does feel  ridiculous, as an Atheist, having to stick for the absurdity of Islam.  I just have to remember that what I'm doing is not favoring or supporting Islam *per se*.  I am merely denying the majoritarian religion from picking on the minority religion.","1375315255"

If we have good social skills, we will have better relationships with people we encounter. Naturally, those that care about us will support us as we pursue our goals, as we will theirs. 

For example, a student in college who has good relationships with his professors and fellow students will find support and resources in them. They will help him with his learning goals.

There are many ways to build social skills. The best is to find something that you are a little bit uncomfortable with (like having a conversation with a stranger at the bus stop) and practice, practice, practice. The key to getting better is to find where you are a bit uncomfortable and put yourself out there. It's the only way to get better.

The distinction you're making is what I call ""style"" vs. ""system"" (terms I made up) -- the style is the mechanics of whatever movements, the system is how that knowledge is passed. I've known a number of excellent martial artists who can't teach for shit, and a number of excellent teachers who weren't particularly stellar martial artists.

""Fighter, Not Art"" being a fallacy, that's just nonsense. If that were the case I could walk in to any school, get the magic pixie dust sprinkled on me, and because it's the system and not me, I'd go from zero-to-hero in no time flat. You can't possibly believe that.

We could legitimately argue which system imparts useful skills most quickly, thus being the ""most smart."" My vote goes to Krav Maga... certainly not wing chun, which is glacially slow in comparison.

We could also argue over which style has produced the greatest fighters (when they were at the pinnacle of their ability, blah, blah, blah). That's unknowable.","1375315258"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; I busted my ass to earn my two degrees

Did you? I ""busted my ass"" to earn my degrees, too, but only in the stupid whiny sense that students mean: I was never below the poverty line, I was never in any real danger of being made unemployed the next day, I didn't have a family to support, I never had to work nights just because if I didn't *I wouldn't be able to eat next week*. I didn't enjoy living off beans out of a can, but I could do so easily knowing that I was going somewhere. Anyone who's flipped burgers for fifteen years would have killed to be in my shoes, sitting in a cushy library reading books enduring an awful lot of fake stress about tests and deadlines and things that don't matter. What happens when you have a family to support, bills to pay and no social mobility?

&gt; I think that merits something.

I've had a fantastic education. That is many times its own reward. I loved it. People are jealous of me just for that. How could I possibly think that having been lucky in early life *entitles* me to being lucky in later life too? Now, I can't blame you if you went into education for the monetary benefits - you're in the majority (of students) there, and it's very sensible. But let's flip the situation around: do you really think that uneducated workers *don't merit* a liveable wage?

&gt; I disagree that professional chefs have it easier.

I never meant to imply that it was a *less skilled* job, just that it was a *less crappy* job. A professional chef might have job satisfaction, whereas a fast food worker might go home at the end of the day covered in grease and cry about where their life is(n't) heading. If you're a chef, you're employable and respected; if you're a fast food worker, you're throwaway and deemed worthless. If you're a chef, you get your own kitchen; if you're a fast food worker you're lumped working with spotty incompetent 16-year-olds forever.

Even if the wages are pathetic, the chef has the easier life. Not just in work, either: imagine you're looking for a girlfriend/boyfriend or trying to make new friends. Do you command more respect as a chef, or a burger flipper?","1375315263"

"electronicmusic","t5_2qmh1","ATB: 9PM (till i come) and PPK: resurection were two of the oldest tracks I can remember falling in love with.

It all started when I was 9 or 10 (2003 I think) and we got a new school bus driver. He changed the radio station from our beloved pre-teen pop hits station to the local dance station. We were resistant at first, but I quickly fell in love. I've been a dance music nut ever since. 

As well as I can remember, my musical taste has progressed thusly (a list in semi chronological order, earliest to now)

ATB - 9PM (till I come)

PPK - Resurection

IIO - Rapture , at the end

Motorcycle - as the rush comes

Alice Deejay - Better off alone

4 strings - Take me away

Milk inc. - Whisper




Then I started to find some weirder stuff, and loved it.


Trentemøller - Moan , take me into your skin

Wisp - Beadumaegen , Ealdgewyrht , loophole (This guy is still one of 
my favorites, and his newer stuff is pretty technically fabulous)

I Monster - Heaven

DJ Shadow - midnight in a perfect world, building steam with a grain of salt

Portishead - Dummy (album)


I discovered massive attack at this point, and have loved them ever since

Massive Attack - Mezzanine (album)

Telepopmusik - Breathe

Röyksopp - Remind me

Basshunter - Dota, Boten Anna. (gotta have your Basshunter phase.)

The prodigy - Always outnumbered, never outgunned (album), Invaders must die! (album)

Nine Inch Nails - with teeth (album), Year zero (album), the downward spiral (album)   --- not really electronic music, but hey, it's influenced me along the way

Jeckyll &amp; Hyde - Free fall (I really liked this one, not sure why it stuck with me, but it did)

Wezz &amp; Fisher - Roll the drums

Ali Payami - Audio Driver

Discovered Deadmau5 at this point, and instantly fell in love. Discovered Boys Noize at about the same time too.


**COLLEGE HAPPENED**

Skrillex phase.

Fell out of the genre for a good portion of my first year at school due to many reasons, but my buddies convinced me to buy tickets to EDC in 2011, and good god, did that reignite my fire.

Aug 26 2011, nearly died in a car accident.

After recovering for a few months, I began to dig into all the mainstream dance music I had missed out on since going to EDC. Never looked back.

Found: Armin van Buuren, Wolfgang Gartner, Bassnecter, Bingo players, Dada Life, Above and Beyond, Afrojack, Infected Mushroom ect.

Learned that I loved most genres, but had a soft spot for trance.

Found Aly and Fila, BT, Markus Schulz, Ferry, Laidback Luke ect. 

EDC 2012, not quite recovered from the car accident (went in a wheelchair, had a fucking blast)

Sorta burnt out on electro house after a while, and started getting into tech house, minimal, techno. (still love my trance though)

EDC 2013.

Found Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Digweed, UMEK, Chris Leibing ect.

You know, that's actually really hard to answer!  I think it *might* be a bit simpler if the universe is infinite, rather than finite and weirdly shaped.  So by occam's razor, the infinite universe would win.  But it's really just a guess.  

On the topic of multiverse theories, I'm not sure if anything I add will be particularly satisfying.  It's not ""science"" because we could never test it--experimentally, it is exactly equivalent to an interpretation that only involves one universe.  And both interpretations are pure speculation.  I wouldn't even go so far as to say that I have any sense of intuition either way on this, because I don't mentally classify the two different interpretations as being distinct from one another.  Given that nothing about the two interpretations is observable, I'm not sure in what way they could even be thought of as distinct.  ","1375315270"

Still, this is a nice graph and gives you a pretty good idea how well to expect a given GPU to perform on this game.

90% is high bro.  really high.  most people you meet won't be worth two seconds of your time.  a very very small percentage of people will be worth some of your time and almost no one will be worth as much time as this girl seems to be by your definition.

sure, you may find that 100% girl.  you may get struck by lighting.  that's actually a lot more common.  at 90% you're already dealing with super rare outliers.  ENFPs are something like 1 in 2000, so you will need to meet 2000 more girls who are attractive and the right age/demographic just to meet one more girl as good as this one.  i don't know how many new people you meet in an average year, you could probably work out how long it will take you to meet one.

life isn't about 100% certainty.  it's about making the best decisions you can without knowing what you are doing.  you never have all the information.  all you ever have is the balance of probabilities.

also, both of you, know that everything ends.  enjoy what you have and cherish it because nothing lasts forever.

i'll finish with a question.  if you knew that you couldn't be together forever, that circumstances beyond your control were going to rip you apart, how would you choose to spend the short time you do have with each other?","1375315274"

They cut nicely the first few times and now they're shitty, yet my folks think they're the best knives ever.  They also got a second set free that they gave to my sister and brother-in-law for Christmas and I just sort of chuckled at their misfortune.

I use knives made of a really high quality steel that cost $50 each that I sharpen regularly and I feel like I'm going to cut my hand off every time I'm back at my parents' house and use their shitty Miracle Blade knives.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","* While a 6 month emergency fund for you would be only $3k, I'd be inclined to keep the entire $5k in savings because it feels like your expenses don't directly map to the possible emergency spending needs.

* Does you job offer a 401k with matching? If so, get the match.

* Open a Roth IRA with Vanguard. You can put in $5500 this year. Put it in the Target 2055 retirement fund. You can put money in for 2013 until 4/15/14. I'd spread your contributions out between now and then (e.g. $611.11/month for the next 9 months) so you can start paying down your loans at the same time

* Everything after that should go towards loans.

If you have any egregiously high loans rate, say over 7%, you could forgo the Roth. But otherwise, while the Roth may not be mathematically the right choice, I think starting a retirement savings habit from the very start is worth it. And being in such a low tax bracket right now makes getting money into the Roth particularly compelling.","1375315277"
"reddevils","t5_2rxse","1. As said the entire summer by several redditors. Letting Marchisio go would be like us selling Fletcher in his prime. It serves no purpose, and makes even less sense considering the amount of years he's spent with Juventus.

2. No. I'd prefer it if we gave the ones we have a chance. Evans has been very good the past 3 seasons, and has grown more mature, more leadership qualities and been very consistent. Smalling has impressed a lot, but been injury prone. And Jones is yet to have a good run of games at one single position. All three of them are good enough to play many important games for us. Rio/Vidic could be good for 2-3 more seasons if they go the Giggsy route and get picked for specific games and keep their bodies in shape with Yoga and a strict diet. I giggle at the thought if Vidic in yogapants though.

That said, a new CB wouldn't be *bad* for us. Just not a top priority.

3. Who? That depends how you see it. I try to keep my expectations in check. People that think Zaha is going to rip the league apart from August to May are probably not going to be correct. But I expect him to be brilliant at times, perhaps a bit inconsistent, but definately match-winning performances at times. That is not going to mean that his season was disappointing to me. I don't ""expect"" any of our players to be disappointing to be honest. But I stand by the opinion that our LB is our weak point in defense, as many of the goals we concede comes as a result of our two main LBs last season were out of position or slow at tracking back. That, as well as depth in midfield. If Carrick gets an injury, I don't think Anderson/Cleverley are going to have the calm and consistency to carry our midfield for say two or three months. A new signing is going to be very important.

If a computer had a feature that was broken, you'd consider that aspect to be inferior to other computers that have it functioning.

That being said, we all have inferiorities.  Many of them don't inconvenience everyone around us.  I don't care if you're deaf or blind or a paraplegic, because these things don't inconvenience everyone around them.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Personally, I do not mind LFR.

I first started playing WoW in late BC where I got to max level and would have to sit at the city all day long to simply look for a dungeon not to mention raid. Being a n00b back then, no one would want to take you on their raid cuz they want experienced people.

LFD/LFR provide a means for people who has no experience whatsoever to learn a fight before even hitting the normal raid. People who intend to do normal raid would certainly look up the fights before LFR so that they can see what the mechanics would be like and how they could optimize their rotation/priority during a fight. However, there is also a down side of it. The extremely low difficulty would make new ""raiders"" think ""oh is that it, I can do that"" and also because people now do not need to join a guild to raid, they will ditch a guild any time, most of them would not stick around for progression.

Our whole guild quit during early DS because it was a joke and the challenge simply wasnt there. Half of the team coming back in MoP and wanted to start raiding again. We got frustrated really quickly trying to recruit raiders to fill the rest of the team. We had people who claimed that they have such and such experience and for some reason they became casual for a period of time and had only done LFR so far and would like to start raiding again. We had so much issue with them and turned our whole gaming experience upside down.

They get so used to things being handed to them from LFR, they are not optimizing their rotation/priority/glyph/talent to suit different fights, they are not paying attention to mechanics which will ultimately kill themselves or even cause a wipe. After that raid night or a couple of raid nights like that, they will eventually leave thinking ""fuck you, you are shit"" without thinking twice if the problem was coming from them. At the end we had to merge with other guilds to get our progression going.

The other issue I have with LFR is that, people do not care. Like someone said before, I pride myself for bring my best game no matter what, if everyone is like that in LFR there wouldnt be so much issue. I recently leveled my druid healers from level 85 to cap. I did a few LFR on MSV/HoF/ToES which were fine cuz most people out geared the content there, but when I moved to ToT thats when I had the issue.

I was undergeared for the raid (47x) as I rememeber, I know I was being bad but I do pull out my best skill to compensate for that. Anyway, on Megera I felt as if I was two healing the crap with another healer (forgot class). We both did around 60-70k hps while 4 disc priests in the raid was doing merely 25-35k hps. Out of curiosity I look at my Skada and found that none of them even bother casting anything but attonement, not even spirit shelling before/during rampage. I also checked their ilv and they are between the 515-525 range.

Out of frustration, I said in raid ""We have 4 disc priest and no spirit shells were casted?"" and then 4 of them ganged up on me and goes ""They cant be fked"" and told me to stfu as no one died.

This kind of mentality in LFR is exactly the reason why I do not do it when I could help myself apart from it being boring. I would rather pug with people who might not down a single boss for 3 hours but trying their best to progress than having anything to do with those douches.","1375315287"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This sounds incredibly outlandish, and I still find it hilarious looking back, but I used to be a train hopper, and was one time asked by my three fellow road dogs to shoot a porn for them, while we were on a moving train with 5 other people. I'm not sure if this applies, but I thought I would share, its about as ""porn like"" as I can think, since I was actually shooting an amateur porn.. of hobos. Anyways, we were riding on two freights that were connected, in two ""buckets"" we call them. We were passing around 2 60s of whiskey, when one of the three pulls out a camera and starts asking the rest of us if someone would like to film them going at it. No one volunteered. This wasn't normally something I would've been down for, but I was half in the bag and thought, what the hell right? yolo as fuck. Anyways, I climbed up onto the two connecting parts, and took the camera, wobbling this way and that, trying to keep a steady aim, honestly, at some points, I wasn't even really paying attention. It was my buddy, and his girlfriend, and my other buddy getting a blowjob from her, while her boyfriend gave it to her from behind. We sped through the Quebec country side in the middle of the day. It was beautiful out, the sun was shining, the other guys (and dogs) were chilling in the other bucket, and I was just sitting there, filming, having whiskey passed to me periodically. They told me they were going to put it on the internet , and would let me know, so that I could watch my awesome porn shooting skills, but we parted ways sometime after Montreal, and I never heard about it since. Somewhere in the internets, my lost hobo porn video exists, I know it. [Here is a picture of me on that train, just before it all went down - the one chugging the bottle.

Trial by Declaration (2nd tab on the page). You fight your ticket by mail. This forces the officer who wrote you the ticket to have to write a long letter defending his ticket and he gets no overtime pay.

you have to pay the ticket up front, but if you lose your trial by declaration, then you get to have another trial in person (trial de novo).

Most of reddit is? I wouldn't say that at all. I think people here are just living in the real world and realize that what we want and what will happen are totally different things. The problem is that the vast majority of consumers aren't concerned with people being able to earn a living wage, if they were we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

&gt; The mindset is, if you work at McDonald's, you're a fuck up and deserve to be on food stamps.

Not really. The mindset is that McDonald's will do what they want and if consumers really cared about a living wage they would go somewhere else to eat. There just isn't a silver bullet solution here, and believing there is one will likely fuck things up for a lot of people.","1375315293"

The crazy thing is I was floating above my body in spirit looking down at my body. I was really sad that I was dead, and I didn't want to be dead. So I went down and put my spirit back into my body and willed myself to come back to life. The next thing I know I was living, and breathing in my body. The weird part is I was uncontrollably crying in a girls arms, who was on my team. I just had tears pouring down my face while she was holding me.

"Heroclix","t5_2sec4","&gt; Do any of you discourage players bringing their extras to play times to give out to folks?

I can't see how a judge or even an owner could get mad at someone for this.  I do think its stepping over the line to openly advertise for selling your heroclix in the store without the owner's approval, but trading and giving your stuff away is just being courteous and an awesome person.

&gt; Most of our tourneys are like a $5 buy-in with a booster as the top prize

While I do think this is absolutely fine and can still result in a great atmosphere, it's why supporting one's store in the first place is so important.  I've seen first hand the process that happens when players are so accustomed to prize product that they entirely forget about how the store manages to acquire those valued figures.  This leads to players buying all their stuff online or through trades and the store ending up with excess product that never sells.  The owner loses money, and just to make up for the excess product that he can no longer sell, he starts charging an entry fee for people just to play.  

It's an unfortunate circumstance that I hope most stores can avoid, and one that can be averted only through understanding/effort by both the ownership and its customers.

Just make sure you don't go overboard trying to support the store.  It's good to buy product from them, but don't feel like you have to buy product equivalent to 4 other people just to make sure the store keep selling heroclix.  That's a sure way to spend heroclix money inefficiently.","1375315296"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was a couple months shy of my 13th birthday then, and about to enter 8th grade. This was when fights with my parents first started to get really bad, and I was often worried about striking a balance with them; how do I make them happy, but maintain my own freedoms and stand up for what I think I deserve? 

On this particular day I was probably worrying about whether a fresh start in school would actually see me getting my grades up (spoiler alert: they stayed average). I was also at the height of my first serious crush, and was finally starting to make separations between who was and was not ""in my league."" I started developing friendships with kids who were bad influences as far as my parents were concerned. Finally started picking up some profanity and ""deviant interests.""

 I am a much better person now than I was then. I have since learned to better pick my battles, worry less about what other people think of me, don't be afraid to stand up for myself but still maintain some tactfulness and be considerate of others, and better arrange my priorities. Reflecting on what my life was ten years ago actually makes me moderately uncomfortable because, while I have changed, I still sort of feel like I have grown less than I had wanted to by now.","1375315299"

In the last three years, with 38 games played, Aberdeen have finished up the season with 38, 41 and 48 points.  If they got any worse at all, surely they'd be relegation candidates?  Then again, there's improvement there and they seem to be one of the few Scottish clubs that aren't in dire straits financially.  By reputation, I would say they're probably Scotland's third club, and with Rangers gone...I can understand the fans wanting second place finishes.  

Scottish football seems to be a fickle thing, though.  One year Hearts are finishing third, then two years later they're 10th.  Is that normal?","1375315299"

Buckskin Gulch / Paria Canyon – Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness Area http://climb-utah.com/Escalante/buckskin.htm

At one point, you might be asked, ""Is this man in the courtroom?"" and then made to point out which man in the room is your attacker, and for me, doing this helped. It was no longer my shameful secret, and I knew then for myself that I was right and he was wrong and it was on me to make sure he was punished, not to
mention ensuring my sister and I were safe from him. After realizing that, it was much easier to look at him as I told the court what he had done to me. I replaced my terror with anger as well as the realization that I was not the damaged one, he was. I wish you the very best in this ordeal because it's emotionally draining.

Only I believe we expect too much of it and are too anxious to bestow upon things names that are an expression of their nature.  The immeasurable advantage which language offers to thinking consists, it seems to me, in its constituting signs for things rather than definitions of them. ...  The word should be, not a definition, but merely a sign for the definition that is always the changeable product of the collective labor of researchers; and it will always remain so with regard to such countless objects of our thinking that the thinker will grow accustomed no longer to regarding the sign as a definition and will in the end unconsciously transfer this lack of signification also to those signs that truly are definitions.  And this too is, it seems to me, quite right.  For, since the signs for concepts cannot be definitions of them, it is almost better to forbid any of them at all to be a definition than for the sake of a few signs that really are definitions to procure a false reputation for all those others which are not. ...

"Yogscast","t5_2sg86","First off, please don't take karma too seriously, and often even talking about downvotes and your karma (number of upvotes you have) results in people downvoting you (like the first rule of fight club). 

I suggest reading through the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) to get a handle on how things work around here. Basically if your comment adds to the discussion then people will upvote you. If it takes away from the conversation (maybe it's completely off topic, maybe someone is trolling, maybe the grammar is off) then people will generally downvote. But if you disagree with someone's opinion and it's still adding to the conversation, this really isn't grounds for downvoting them. 

But reddit also has a complex algorithm so that it messes with the upvote/downvote totals so you can't really tell what the real amount of people upvoting and downvoting you is. This happens, for instance, when a post gets older. 

Anyways, as /u/President_toom pointed out, the best way to learn is to keep an eye out for whats happening, watch what people are posting and how they are contributing and then try to engage with the community yourself once you think you've got a handle on it.

Does this mean I don't like these films? Of course not, but we should really distinguish the difference of what really happened, to what a movie is.

"wow","t5_2qio8","&gt;All I pointed out was a clear and evident fact. As raiding has become more open and single-play oriented. And with the addition of increased cross-realm zoning, subs have clearly dwindled. From over 12 million to 7.7 million.

You cannot **prove** this. You can't state something as fact, when there's nothing to back it up. You can make the claim, I guess, but that doesn't make it true. To be fair, it's not like Blizzard is really open about this sort of thing, but there are a few things they have commented on --

You can't sit there and ""state"" as a ""fact"" that subs went done because raiding became more accessible -- that's insane. Could it have contributed? Perhaps, though I personally doubt it (given that raids have historically been a minority of the wow playerbase, I would find it hard to believe that millions quit for that reason).

It's not a ""Fact"", it's nonsense and I'm tired of seeing it. I don't mean to be so rude but it gets really old. You're free to make the correlation, but it doesn't make it true. ""Welfare"" Epics happened in TBC and subs skyrocketed (heh, people are STILL bitching about them). Yet you'd have to be crazy to try to make that argument. I personally think that extremely difficult 5mans, and the normal raid difficulty of Cata helped to destroy many guilds and caused many to leave -- yet even if I come across many with similar stories while playing; I don't feel it's fair to make such an argument -- for all I know more people raided in Cata than Wrath. At the end of the day, only Blizzard knows for sure.

Until Blizzard confirms stuff, all we know for certain are the things they've told us -- one of them is what type of players use LFR (that would be a fact). Your claim, on the other hand, is just an opinion -- trying to assert something to fit a narrative. It would be like my claiming that wow got 12 million subs because they added welfare epics to the game in TBC, or that they got 12 million subs because the horde got elves, or because they added arena or whatever; sure those things corresponded but it's silly to make such an argument.

Something else to consider: Stuff we/you don't like (CRZ or LFR or whatever) might actually be positive for the game. After all, to use a page from your book -- CRZ was introduced, and since that time WoW lost less subs then then they did previously ;)","1375315307"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Your assumptions here make some pretty big leaps.  Boys who are 18 and have 17 year old girlfriends whose parents had a gripe, or a girl who makes any kind of claim or accusation, etc... these kids end up on sex offender lists too, by no real fault of their own, but some fine line in the law. You've jumped straight to 'he's a fifty year old male and touches babies' without knowing the situation. It could very easily (I see this often as a high school teacher around kids 16-18 years old) have been something blown out of proportion; there are also females on the registered sex offender list.


I am not a rape apologist or anything like that. But I think humans are humans and everyone has a story and we can't blanket statement any of them - hover parents, hands-off parents... even sex offenders.


And he (if OP is in fact male) is right, statistically everything about our world today suggests that the US is actually safer from crime than it was before.  You have to think about how much technology has broken down our barriers of privacy and our personal bubbles - it's hard to get away from the media who wants us to fear the outside world, and to rely on them to tell us what to think and feel about everything.  Before the internet, particularly, it was a lot harder to find these stories, and not all of it got reported.

Generally this is not recommended and for good reasons, but for kernels it should be fine. I had 3.11 running on my Debian desktop for the new AMD power management support.

&gt;*what history? Imperial Japan raped and murdered ***all*** Asians during ww2...*

That's not true. Definitely not towards the Taiwanese. They built much of the infrastructure for the first time, Taiwanese were allowed to participate in government for the first time, for the first time they got a decent education and some Taiwanese got so affluent that they even owned private planes. Women were getting close to equal rights and the pop songs of the day were about woman's suffrage that people listened to in cafes in the early and mid 1900's.

In contrast, under the Manchu and Qing, the Taiwanese would revolt every 2-3 years because they got horrible treatment as extreme second class citizens. The ROC government massacred tens of thousands and disappeared countless more that we don't know until this day, along with the second longest martial law period in history.

Again, it helps to not generalize history. That asshole you hate from high school? He probably had friends too. That popular kid you liked in high school, probably treated some people horribly.  Not everyone treats everyone the same way.","1375315309"

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","Ya, since OP was talking about raw milk... much of the difference will probably come from not being homogenized either. Cooking it in any way will basically pasteurize it, so there won't be much of a difference. Drinking it as is, there will be more variance between batches since it's not homogenized. I'd also imagine the taste being different, but you have to try it to see if you notice it.","1375315310"

"networking","t5_2qkaf","If it is bad SnR from your modems to your CMTS in your basement, the issue is in your network and not your ISPs.

Splitters are the bane of cable modems, you lose ~4db signal on every splitter. unterminated jacks on splitters can also introduce some RF noise that lowers your signal even more.

If you are in the Northern Hemisphere, and it is summer, high temperature can also hurt a system, but that usually causes the signal to be too high for the system.

is downstream SnR also horrible? you might have to log into a modem to see this easier (depending on your CMTS) I believe default address on the motorola modems is 192.168.100.1 (you would have to be behind the modem to see this, they by default do not allow you to see the page from the 'WAN' side of the modem)

Is your system a single upstream and downstream, or how many channels are you running.

You say you have CATV running on the same coax.  Could there be interference from a adjacent TV channel that may be overloading the signal?  

What kind of modulation are you using on your upstreams QPSK or 16QAM, if 16QAM could try dropping to QPSK if you are having modems continuously go offline.","1375315311"

1) The government does not require a member of the public to use a public restroom.  Cameras to be installed.

2) The government doesn't require a member of the public to live in a house, apartment, condo, or any other domicile.  Therefore, cameras to be installed.  Don't worry, they can watch from outside...or from the drones they will be flying everywhere in a few years as soon as they work out the logistics.  It's in the works though.. because terrorism.

Having said that, I usually just use greyscale for any charts that have less than ten series - it solves lots of problems for my colorblindness, and if anyone needs to print the chart there's no risk of losing data from reproducing on a b/w printer. 

For charts with more than ten series I often struggle, but will use shades of blue, shades of orange, and shades of green which isn't always pretty, but reduces the risk of confusing series (for me at least).","1375315311"

She thought it was fucking hilarious and boy, was she smug about it. :)

Well, most beat'em ups are kinda like that. The difficulty setting just sets the upper and lower bounds and the AI adjusts itself to your playing style (within these bounds).

For example, if you completely own the first few opponents in Killer Instinct and demonstrated your advanced skills while doing so by using extremely varied moves/combos and counters/breakers, the game would become *way* more challenging.","1375315311"

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","I don't think they have a win second mindset, they aren't afraid to approve money to make the team better, such as the recent Felix extension or the 2008 season when they ran one of the highest payrolls in MLB. It's more that they haven't spent money as wisely as they could have, or made the right trades. The Bavasi years screwed our farm system to the point where this is probably the first year it's back to full strength. And while they are one of the few teams to run zero debt, all credible accounts say that they aren't running it for profit. Racking up debt can get a team into a really sticky situation, like with the Dodgers or Rangers before the current regimes in those places took over. Also allows them to spend in times such as this year when they reportedly are running a payroll higher than they can sustain based on preseason project revenue. And this is backed up by the fact that the Mariners are receiving/received revenue sharing for the first time in a long while, maybe first time ever.

If *government* screws up, you basically have to suck up the cost and keep on plugging.  

Mistakes of this caliber are found years, sometimes literally decades, after the mistakes were actually made.  There is therefore not even a cycle of learning from mistakes that can occur, unless voters are educated about the history of it all.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Pretty sure that isn't what they meant. I read the statement 'cool art' as aesthetic, and it is at large what Bioshock games have been very good at, producing a pretty unique and involving aesthetic.

I don't think it is a statement on games as art so much as it is stating that the DLC is not playing to the strengths of the Bioshock series of games, nor even what the majority of Bioshock fans would want out of DLC. I tend to agree, though I am very interested in the 2 part DLC coming up with the Noir detective story type thing set in Rapture. Seems like it would play to the strengths of bioshock more effectively than an arena mode.

* [[rec]^2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245112/reference)
* [Retribution](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0843302/reference) is also quite good, though not as good as the other ones in this list, it probably has some of the most uncomfortable encounters between a person and a ghost that I can recall.

I would also highly recommend [Mama](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2023587/reference), which is not a foreign horror movie. ","1375315317"

There is however the topic of: are dairy products even healthy in the first place? The China Study opened my eyes to Casein(protein in milk) and it's links to cancer, so my views now are a lot less lenient for things like this.

The same sentiment goes with freegans. I get what you're doing, and I agree with the whole thing 100%, I just think a more medically informed decision would be to avoid all animal foods in the first place. To me meat and dairy is the cigarettes of our generation. We had doctors promoting which cigarette was better last century, now we are going through a shift as well, and slowly western medicine is catching up with the resarch. But just because something is free, and/or you found it in a dumpster, dosen't mean it is a good idea to eat it. (Again I'm not hating on dumpster diving, just that moment where a fellow human recognizes pasteurized cow breast excretions combined with preservatives and artificial flavoring as food in the first place. I think it's not the most informed decision for your health. I want all vegans to live the most thriving and optimal lives. No milk from giraffes or whales, or kangaroo milk, or mouse milk or cow milk. I mean I wouldn't even drink human milk, I'm 26.)

I recommend everyone to subscribe to nutritionfacts.org for GREAT plant based research. I went vegan for health reasons, and I'll absolutely stay vegan forever (enhanced obviously by ethical side of not participating in exploitation), but I feel like we need to stress this more and more often. Dairy and meat cause diseases, and plants cure them.

Current Job Title: Software Developer II  


I had a crappy GPA out of university (2.5) in BS Comp Sci so my offers weren't particularly competitive. I got stuck doing work on old COBOL systems when the project I was originally hired for got cancelled.   


Fast forward a couple of years and I changed jobs, started as a Software Developer I and working my way up since then. I spent my first year or so working on asp.net and some legacy VB6/COM+ components. These days I'm developing in .NET, worked on a variety of projects and am well versed in web services, asp.net, sql, and windows ce development (kiosk style apps).  


I'm getting promoted in a couple of months to a III, so that should get me a nice pay bump. Unfortunately my company moves at a snails pace in terms of advancing tech so I think I'll need to leave to keep my skills up to date.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I think before you can lose weight you need to really examine WHY you over eat. You say you have anxiety and suicidal thoughts you blame on your weight, but the cravings and night time binge eating you described sound stress related. It is stressful to be 13 to start, and I know from experience that being overweight at that age can make things incredibly  stressful, lonely, painful etc. However, aside from your weight problems are there other things going on in your life? It sounds like you could really benefit from speaking to someone. I was insanely depressed at your age and honestly psychologists/counselors etc never worked for me. Luckily as I got older I developed more self awareness and strategies for coping. Maybe formal counseling sessions would work for you, maybe not. If not I strongly suggest trying to confide in someone you trust, someone who can talk things through with you. If you can't find that continue to reach out to online communities like this one. 

About your bully, if things like this are happening regularly it needs to stop. No one has a right to put their hands on you. Don't be afraid to call the cops for fear of what other people will say about you. If you're being bullied in other ways (verbally, cyber bullying) that's just as bad, and there's no easy way to deal with it. I was bullied for years, however that changed when I was just as aggressive back. Stand your ground. 

About the pot (saw the other post) I don't condemn it, but if you are using it as a coping mechanism it's just going to make things worse because you won't ever deal with the real problem. I have no idea how much you smoke or how often but pot can cause anxiety problems especially with people who smoke a lot. Some people don't realize the connection between their anxiety and pot smoking until they stop smoking..something to think about.

Now for issues more directly related to food:

It's tougher being your age and trying to lose weight because as you said you have so little control over things like what is purchased for groceries. I'm 23 and have my own place, I NEVER buy junk food when I'm at the grocery store, but there are SO many nights when I'm like 'man I wish I had a bag of chips right now', so I understand its not easy when it's in the house. Try and see if you can get your grandpa to purchase healthier snack options. I personally like things like yogurt (good thick Greek yogurts like chobani are the best, as they are the most filling) bananas, and triscuits with hummus (still fairly high calorie but personally I'll eat less of those than chips because they are more filling and not as flavorful) 

Try and get busy. It's easy to boredom eat. It's easy to sink into apathy and not do much...but try going for a walk, coloring (I know it sounds dumb but it's soothing lol) read, volunteer...be creative. Just find things to do that you enjoy.

Exercise. I hate conventional gym exercise, I really really do. It just does not work for me. Instead I swim and hike...I'm exercising with the added bonus that I enjoy it. 

Calorie count as best you can. Keep a food journal of some form, because it makes it easier to evaluate your eating habits. I have an iPad and I use fitness plus, most foods (even dishes from fast food places) are on there. An alternative is myfitday.com..the  food database isn't as extensive, but it's a good alternative. Or just go old school and write it down (never worked for me, I'm too disorganized)

I weigh myself daily. Some people say weekly..but it's a matter of preference. Just be sure to weigh at least weekly. Record your weight along with your food.

Take pictures! This becomes more fun as the weight starts coming off and you can see the difference between photos. 

Don't give up! It's going to be an uphill battle at first. You can't lose weight until you begin correcting all the patterns and habits that led to you being overweight. it's not easy to change your behavior, but you can do it. You won't be able to wake up tomorrow and fix everything all at once...focus on one area at a time and try not to be frustrated with yourself for not being perfect.

At 13 I was 5'3 and almost 170 lbs. Now I'm 23 and 138. YOU GOT THIS! 



Good luck!

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","I think frame size is the size of your skeletal (frame)-- how big your bones are and how far apart they are whereas your clothing size is determined by both your frame size and how much muscle or fat you have on top of your skeleton. Someone can be small framed and chubby (Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones) and a larger clothing size.   Smaller framed people are on average smaller clothing sizes but large framed doesn't equal skinny and big framed doesn't equal chubby.

People sometimes use wrist size to determine frame size because people don't have much fat in their wrists.

SLUTWALKS AREN'T ABOUT SAYING ""I LOVE SLUTS."" SLUTWALKS ARE ABOUT DECLARING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET WEARING WHATEVER SHE WANTS, WITHOUT PEOPLE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT SHE IS A ""SLUT,"" THAT SHE WANTS ATTENTION, THAT SHE'S SEXUALLY PROMISCUOUS, OR THAT SHE IS LOOKING FOR TROUBLE. 

Have you ever seen a slutwalk, or photos from one? No one is carrying around signs saying ""I love sluts."" The focus is about how **no one** deserves to be raped. The focus is on the importance of enthusiastic consent. The focus is on respecting women regardless of how they are dressed. No one is talking about whether or not they ""love"" sluts, because that's not the fucking point of the demonstration.   ","1375315325"

"baldursgate","t5_2t07j","Regarding your point about level 1 letting you get a handle on the characters better, I disagree.  With so few skills available by the time you reach max level, you never really get the sense for what a Mage, a Sorcerer, a Thief, a dual or multi-classed character can do.  Especially with the smaller hit point pools, it's very easy for many classes to be one shot throughout the first 10 to 12 hours of gameplay.

Regarding quest order, I would suggest something along the following in an unmodded game:  1) Aerie and the Circus, 2) Free the Slaves, 3) Sewers and Llilarcor, 3) Slaveship, 4) Shadow Thief Docks Quest (make sure you have a mage with Breach for the first of Edwin's quests), 5) De'Arnise Keep with the Umber Hulks.

[Regarding defeating the Umber Hulks, there is a way to get my them without fighting them at all.  On the main floor of the keep, if you exit the front doors, you will find yourself fighting an Otyugh.  Thereafter, you will see five dogs.  If you kill them, they will drop bones.  Put those in your inventory and head back inside to the kitchen where a troll normally stands ready to kill a servant.  Make yourself a full portion of dog stew.  Save it.](/spoiler)

[When you finally head downstairs and defeat the trolls in the first room just before the umber hulks, keep your main party back and conceal one character possessing the stew with either invisibility or straight stealth.  Have that character enter the umber hulk room and proceed south towards the jail cells.  In the southwest most area, you will find a large grave where you can put the stew.  The umber hulks will all flee towards it, and you will be free to proceed.  Be sure to close the doors behind you!](/spoiler)","1375315325"

Cairns is still pretty backwards when it comes to I.T. Most businesses are in the 'Break-fix' mentality rather than getting a managed I.T. solutions. They don't put much value of their IT infrastructure (until it blows up in their face).

With your fiber background, get in contact with [Skilled](http://www.skilled.com.au), also there are a number of local Fiber companies/contractors. It appears the NBN is beginning to roll out here so it might be a good time to get your foot in the door. Also have a gander into places in Brisbane/Syd/Melb that may require a remote network engineer.

Townsville/Mackay/Rockhampton all have better industries/infrastructure than Cairns, and I've seen alot more new positions rolling over being advertised, so it might be an idea. 

Best thing to do is trawl the Seek and Careerone, like Gawdor mentioned. I'd go as far to say $30k is entry level pay. If you're skilled and experienced then I'd be aiming for $45k-$55k entry. 

But, in saying all this.... Good Luck

As far as your product, is it a e-cig? I see that its a vaporizers, but arent e-cigs vaporizers? I really didnt see the word ""e-cigarettes"" anywhere so this confused me on what exactly the product is. If people are hesitant on the identity of the product, it might make them sway away from purchase. 

There are a ton of e-cig products. I know a kid who recently launched a ""hookah pen"", and he has been doing pretty well in this saturated market. 

Here are a few things he did. 

Made a vid of him demonstrating the product. He made a 15 min vid of him using it, reviewing it, and cleaning it. Surprisingly the simple vid gained some attention from youtube. It also helped the uneasy buyers to commit once they saw it in use. 

Have other's review your item. For example, there are a couple of popular youtube channels that devote their time and energy to review various ""electronic cigarette"" products. Contact them and have a review done of yours.

I recently started seeing this kid's hookah pens in various gas stations in our area. Either he contacted a distributor and got them on board. Or he simply went gas station to gas station asking if they would buy his item wholesale or if they would offer him a consignment deal. This isnt very hard since most gas stations are privately owned. Simply go to some of them and see what they say about holding your product. 

Just wanted to share some thoughts. I love the eCommerce world and did substantial research for the e-cig market.

I work inside sales and had been going to jigsaw, data, reference USA, you name it for leads. I would run searches for customers that I thought would be a good fit. I would rip through the whole list in a day or few days and be left with empty pockets.

I decided to get analytical. I looked up the top 3 customers of every successful sales person on my team and pulled every smidgen of information I could from our system and the internet on them. How much sales revenue, exactly (I mean exactly) what industry they are in, how many employees do they have, are they urban or suburban or other, etc, etc, etc. 

I took this information pumped it into excel and realized what I thought (and most other people in my company thought) were good customers or potential fits, simply weren't. I was wasting a ton of time calling less than ideal prospects. I refocused, ran new lists and started closing people like mad. Things have been good lately. I hope this helps.

"TrayvonMartin","t5_2tsst","Again, I'm not surprised if whites buy more (in total) rap albums or songs.  They make up over 70% of the population; it's to be expected.   I'm talking about influence.  

A good number (maybe even the majority) of black kids seem to pattern their behavior, demeanor, and style after the hip-hop artists they listen to.  I don't see this same influence on white kids.  

And, again, I'm only using rap as an example.  I'm not in favor of censoring rap or otherwise impeding anyone from releasing rap albums.  All I'm saying is that there is a distinct difference in the pattern of behavior we see in black and white people - specifically young black and white people.  Surely you see this?  When you hear a story about rioting and looting, is it not mostly black people?  If you look at crime statistics, why do black people commit crimes in numbers far greater than their percent of the population?  It's not institutional racism.  

&gt;There are plenty of white artists that are horrible horrible human beings, and It's not up to me to prove that to you. 

Yep.  That's sex, drugs, and rock and roll for you.  I wouldn't want my kids emulating the lifestyle of Ozzy Osbourne.  The difference is behavior and influence.  Whereas Lil Wayne (or whoever) will do something on TV and you'll see black kids emulating it the next week, I don't remember white kids emulating Ozzy when he bit the head off a bat (to use a very old example).

&gt;you always have more violent crimes when you have povety This is a short short interview with tony Bouza http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz_X4b4f0Lg#t=01h21m54s

Exactly my point!  What is conditioning black Americans - specifically young black males - to behave in such a violent manner in such numbers?  Something is causing it and I can't see how you can just blame poverty.  Numbers wise there are more white people in poverty than black people.  Why, then, are youth crime statistics not more proportional to the population makeup?  

If white people are 70% of the population (it's around that number), I would expect them to make up 70% of the crime.  That's not the case.  Black people, for example, are about 13-15% of the population yet are arrested (but not necessarily convicted) of almost half the murders in this country.  ""Poverty"" isn't a reason.  Conditioning is a reason, but what or who is conditioning them?  For young black males, I would start with the fact that the average black boy doesn't have a good male role model growing up.

I can see him feeding his CFs as they come past him or turning players to create space, but surely he'd just be marked out of the game?

There's a decent amount of info out there that suggests you need about 1200 calories a day for your internal organs to work properly.

Also, you'll lose a lot of muscle mass.

You'll also hear about something called ""metabolic damage."" Some experts swear it's horrible, lots of others claim it isn't real. The idea is that with so few calories, your body slows down essential functions of your internal organs to retain as much mass as possible. Obviously, internal organs operating at less than ideal levels is bad. And since your body is trying to retain mass, it will slow down weight loss.

The only real study we have on this was done around WWII on guys who were down to dangerously low bodyfat levels, and they had pretty bad side-effects. The details are [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Starvation_Experiment).

You didn't mention your weight, but for your height and activity level, 1500 calories a day is probably the minimum you want to hit.","1375315338"

I fidget a lot with my hands. I like to doodle, click pins, play with things, and my leg bounces constantly, unless I'm aware of it and want to stop it.

Focusing royally screws up my ability to learn. Not to sound self-righteous, but I'm above average intelligence and I know it, and that's probably the only reason I haven't failed most of my classes. But I have a lot of problems paying attention to lecturers, especially if they aren't that interesting, and I lose focus on what they are saying and drift off into my head. By the time they come back they are on something else that built upon what I missed, so I'm completely lost. In grade school I failed advanced algebra like twice because I'd get so flustered and give up in class. 

When it's really bad I can't focus on my reading very well and forget what I just read, so I don't understand what I'm reading so I have to read it over and over just to get it.

[shifting the burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof) - YOU are doing something more, killing sentient creatures. You are the one who needs to prove this stuff.

[Naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy) - you claim it is normal and natural *and therefore good* - nope. Not a proper argument.

[Appeal to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority) - you are claiming that you are this totally qualified PHD in foodology.. and that's why we should believe you? Even IF it is true, this does not exempt you from having to provide proof.

i don't like the end-run around the failed charges either, but let's not confuse this guy with someone who's completely innocent.  if we are to believe the part of the story where he gets screwed over liquor, we also have to believe the part where he taunted the DA with being able to ""do it again if he wanted"".

if anything, this is a story about why not to taunt the DA by admitting your guilt off-record.  shady or not, she did technically go through legal channels to ruin his life, even if it wasn't on the original charges.  the guy was a moron, a douche, and perhaps a rapist.  she was a zealot with the law on her side.  what kind of dumb fuck taunts a lawyer?  a DA no less.

I find one metric for measuring how efficient my launch vehicle is launch vehicle mass (sans payload) /  payload.

For a rocket getting this under 6 seems pretty difficult.

For a hybrid with disposable air-breathing stage, 2 is fairly easy, and going lower depends largely on how much you want to abuse the air intakes (1 intake to 1 engine is more realistic).

For an SSTO (ie. the only bit that separates is the thing you want in space which you haven't used in any way on the way up), 2 seems to be about my limit, depending on size/mods/cargo bay/etc.

A select pro can probably consistently hit a 9 iron 165 yards. A par 4 should average 400 yards. So 165 and 165 is 330. Thats a 70 yard chip with a 9 iron, which I bet they haven't practiced, ever. Then they have to make a putt, probably average distance of 20 feet on a green that isnt smooth and is slow. Thats just par 4s, so 10 holes are going to give them trouble. Probably best Id give would be 5 over par if he keeps out of bunkers. 

Then there's par 5s. Same predicament as par 4s, we'll say that's 2 over

 Par 3s can range from 100 to 200 yards and generally have more trouble around the greens than the other holes. Lucky to leave them at 1 over.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I think the main issue with the Wii U is that they are sort of missing a major market, and that's why I don't think they are really going to do too well this holidays. 

The Wii sold a hell of a lot of consoles with the casual crowd. These were people like your mom, who brought the Wii, and a Fitness Board, and used it about twice before letting it collect dust in the corner. Now, they have no reason to buy another console. Their copy of Wii Fit still works fine, and non of these new games on the Virtual console will interest them, plus if anything they have moved onto tablet gaming, so they're out. 

Then, you have the other type of casual crowd. These are the ones who buy Call of Duty and FIFA every year. Now, among this crowd grew the idea that the Wii was more for kids, pushed primarily because in the last generation they didn't have many 'hardcore' games (compared to your Gears of War and Uncharted on the other consoles), and because their mom owned one, so they're out. From people I've talked to in this crowd, the Wii U isn't even an option that comes up when talking about consoles, only the PS4/X1. 

So that is two big groups of consumers pretty much out of buying a Wii U. Combine this with the PS4/X1 launching this holiday, and you'll have a lot fewer kids putting them on their Christmas lists. So, the Wii U might not do as badly as last year, but they'll still be miles behind the competition, and you'll have to question how they'll fair in the coming years.","1375315360"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Anarcho capitalism doesn't assume or require people to be good. On the contrary, the fact that some people are evil is why we need anarchism in the first place. If everyone were good, we would have good governments. But there are evil people and working for the government (as policemen, soldiers, bureaucrats, politicians, etc.) is where they can live out their immoral desires to the greatest extent.

The reason corporations in a free society would not be able to act like governments is that corporations ultimately derive all their money, and hence their power, from satisfying consumer needs. Walmart cannot force you to buy their products, so they cannot just do whatever they want. If the CEO of Walmart tortured kittens in his spare time, people would be outraged when they found out, and much fewer people would shop at Walmart.

The government is not bound by such considerations. People are forced at the point of a gun to pay for the ""services"" government provides. You don't like your government to run a concentration camp, firebomb civilians, or throw people in prison for smoking a certain plant? Too bad, you have to pay for it anyway.

Personal health issue she isn't comfortable talking about yet - loosing weight suddenly could be part of it. But, who knows maybe she's pregnant and just concerned about not doing it right (although taking a prenatal vitamin and eating healthy should be enough).

In the end, you can't force them to eat what you want them to. Even if there's no ulterior motive than she misses cheese. You can either accept it and keep dating her, or not and end things. I'm sorry because it doesn't sound like an easy thing to face.","1375315374"

For example, Maps sometimes uses location data (and therefore battery) even when you're not using it, so I Greenify it. The app is not broken or badly programmed (though they've done stuff in 4.3 to make it use less battery), it's just going to use battery in the background. Similarly, Facebook is dogshit so I Greenify it so that it doesn't hog resources while backgrounded. In this case Greenify is a happy medium between uninstalling because it's crap and keeping it to use occasionally.

Examples of apps you don't want to Greenify would be apps that you *want* to run in the background, like chat apps (they use battery because they're keeping you logged in - if you Greenify them they won't work) and apps that are well-programmed and use very little battery when cached (this should be most apps, i.e.: browsers, reddit apps, cameras, etc.).","1375315377"

The first two iPhones, for instance, ran at 400MHz, but the SoC was capable of, and rated for, 620MHz. That didn't mean it was a 620MHz phone, though; jailbreak hacks which clocked it back to 620MHz tended to cause overheating-prompted shutdowns and unreasonable power usage.","1375315378"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","You sound like a mid player. 

Top doesn't roam if they're ahead and haven't gotten tower. They roam from behind. It's just too far to do anything in the other lanes without losing a lot of cs or turret. 

If you have tp then roaming is fine since you can just tp back top or tp to another lane, kill and go back top. 

If you're ahead top you need to ward up and shove hard. This should draw the jungler top which helps lower pressure elsewhere on the map. 

Once you have tower you can start roaming. 

If you're behind staying and being denied is risky and a waste of time. You're better off trying to catchup in other ways such as trading top tower for mid tower. Or getting a drake for top and then freezing. (if you can safely farm under tower and scale better than you're opponent; irelia- then farming under tower is fine key word is safely)

EDIT: do note I don't mean you can't invade enemy red/blue as your roam. Pushing top into tower and invading the buffs(even just to ward and then come back later) is definitely good if you're ahead. Just don't lose waves to tower by spending time in their jungle. Also, it's mostly general advice, a kill+tower mid is obviously worth more than denying top cs. ","1375315389"

There are many of us who are not happy with the state of the game or with EA or Maxis practices or business decisions and can still have a mature conversation about it.

At this point many of the trolls left this sub. Those who still make an appearance here and there get downvoted quickly. I think the community is mature enough that it sort of governs itself.

&gt; It's a big time in Max's life. He's college bound with his friends and finally free of his embarrassing father as he strives to be a top contender for the X-Games. Unfortunately, Goofy loses his job and learns that he cannot get another job without a college degree. To his son's mortification, Goofy decides to join him in his campus to get that degree. Desperate to distract his father, Max talks him into joining the competing Gamma Fraternity team and introduces him to a wonderful librarian who shares his nostalgic love for 1970's pastimes. Unfortunately, things do not go according to plan as events put this father-son relationship to the test.

The tools are real and they are there and they are making a gamble that with experience he will put it all together. He has the leverage because if they didn't take the gamble then somebody else would. I mean they could have let him go into RFA and just match any offer but a lot of the time committing without being forced to does a lot for chemistry and making a player feel wanted. I absolutely see him reaching his potential and IMO he might have the highest ceiling of any current PG in the NBA. Yes he hasn't reached it yet but as I said before if you don't pay him somebody else will and you're out of a potential franchise player. I will agree 80 million does seem pretty steep for what he has accomplished but the Wizards clearly believe in his potential.

Are you comparing these backpacks to womens' luxury brand purses (Louis Vuitton, etc)? Those are expensive mainly because of the brand name. Yes, they might use somewhat better materials than cheap handbags, but much of the price comes from the brand name. On the other hand, the cost of these backpacks can be attributed mainly to their superior materials and quality construction and not so much to brand name or hype.

If the Saints are playing that Sunday, the bar area is cordoned off and reserved for Saints fans.

I only made it out there once when I lived in the area. The food is good. Not the Ritz on Canal Sunday brunch good, but worth the money. Especially to get to watch the game around a bunch of folks from New Orleans or the Gulf South. Especially to get to watch the reactions of the church folks as you order rounds of drinks to celebrate things like the kickoff, not having to listen to Cris Collinsworth announce the game, stuff like that.

Distance from Atlanta? Who gives a shit. Everyone lives in the suburbs, anyway. It is on the NW side of the perimeter near where 285 meets 75. There are no hipsters. I repeat, no hipsters. So this is your alternative to Little Five Points.

They / the enemy purchased Master Yi in the store. You can access the store at the top right corner in the Client. Then you click on champions on the left side. Search ""master yi"" on the search bar.

 Now you can buy him, either with RP (These are Riot Points, you need to pay €/$ for them) or IP (Influence Points, you get those by playing.)

When you purchase them in the store you can play them whenever you want -- except when a teammate already picked him. 

Levels only unlock runes and masteries. (You can access those on your profile &gt; runes / masteries // you must buy runes with IP at the store) Only buy Tier 1 or Tier 3 runes. Dont ever buy tier 2 runes, they suck. 

You can google for example ""Shyvana guide"" and you will find which runes and which masteries are best suited for shyvana.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Speaking from Latin America, there were multiple accounts of Westerners *living* within Native American contexts. Assimilation, I suppose, is a degree of what you'd consider assimilated or not.

Hans Staden, for example, was a German mariner who was shipwrecked with a Portuguese crew off the coast of present-day Brazil in 1548. He was captured by a group of people he refers to as the Tupinamba in 1552, who also allegedly practiced cannibalism. He was held captive for three years, (no thanks to the French, who he notes were allies to the Tupinamba, and refused to recognize Staden as not Portuguese, perceived to be enemies of the Tupinamba). He finally escaped in 1555, and upon arriving home wrote *Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen* (roughly translates as: True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-eating People in the New World, America). A translated source would be Neil Whitehead's titled *Hans Staden's True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil* (Durham: Duke University Press, 2008). 

It was one of the first accounts of practiced cannibalism, and while there are questions about how exaggerated or not these claims were (in particular, see Arens, William *The Man-Eating Myth* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971)), I hesitate to say ""assimilated"" because if you read the account, Staden (according to himself) stays true to his Christian, European roots, and attempts to convert the Natives towards Christianity, rather than accepting their values as his own.


A more familiar account might be that of the first people in Yucatan. Geronimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero were sailing in 1511 when they were shipwrecked, and ended up in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. While Aguilar stayed true to his religion (he was a Franciscan Friar), Guerrero became a famous war chief, and allegedly fathered the first mestizo children in Latin America. Aguilar would later escape, and meet with Cortés and be instrumental in translation during the colonization of Mexico in 1519. Part of this story is recorded in Fray Diego de Landa's *Relación de las Cosas de Yucatan* which is translated into English best by Alfred Tozzer, and published by Harvard Press, 1941.
 
They are depicted as such: ""Of the two, Aguilar was a good Christian and had a breviary with which he kept run of the feast-days; and he was saved in the year 1518 on the arrival of the Marquis Hernando Cortés. Guerrero, since he understood the language, went to Chetumal, which is Salamanca of Yucatan. There a lord named Nachan Can received him and placed him in charge of the military affairs; in which he distinguished himself, gaining many victories over the enemies of his lord, and he taught the Indians to fight, showing them how to construct forts and bastions. In this way, as well as by adopting the habits of the natives, he gained a great reputation and they married him to a woman of high rank, by whom he had children; and for this reason he did not try to escape, as Aguilar did. On the contrary he tattooed his body and let his hair grow, and pierced his ears, so as to wear earrings like the Indians, and it is probable that he became an idolater like them"" (Tozzer's translation, page 8). Other accounts of this are available in Mayan, but Landa's depiction is probably the most reliable for a Western source.

More anecdotally, I seem to remember Pope Innocent IV around 1245-6 sending delegates towards the Mongols, and possibly them posting accounts about their interactions within a Mongol-based context, but I also could be completely making that up.

Two sources with other Captivity sources are Sayre, Gordon M. ed. *American Captivity Narratives : Selected Narratives with Introduction* (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000) and Castillo, Susan + Schweitzer, Ivy eds. *The Literatures of Colonial America : an Anthology* (Malden: Blackwell Publishers, 2007).

&gt;What if the screws don't line up?

They will line up. Don't worry about it.

&gt;How easy is it to connect the front USB?

Consult the motherboard manual to locate the header (jack) and you just plug it right in. Most front panel connectors are keyed and bundled into one plug, so you just plug it in and go. The bitch is front panel connectors like Power LED, Power button, Reset button, etc. ASUS makes little jumper bracket things to make doing that a lot easier though. (Note: They can only be used on ASUS brand motherboards)

&gt;How intuitive is installing the PSU?

4 screws. Done.

&gt;How easy is it to screw-up installing the processor?

Fairly easy for a beginner. The CPU is delicate and extremely sensitive to electrostatic dissipation (static electricity). It takes **much** less electric energy to fry a CPU that it does to physically feel a static shock on your finger. [Here is a comment I made yesterday regarding installation of heatsinks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1jehq3/cpu_heats_to_120_celsius_as_desktop_boots/cbdvpj1)

&gt;Does the processor come with that thermal paste?

Yes, but don't use it. Buy Arctic Silver, the tube will last forever as a little bit goes a long way. Don't use the factory heatsink.

&gt;Some sites offer extended warranty, should I do that?

If you want to, sure. Never a bad idea protecting your investment.

&gt;What if I got all the right parts, installed them properly, but the thing just doesn't turn on? Is it possible to return all the parts or did I just make an expensive mistake?

Anything is possible. It takes someone with a bit of knowledge to diagnose problems with new parts. If the thing just doesn't turn on at all, well it could be a bad PSU or a bad motherboard. I have been pretty lucky in my lifetime and only had one DOA motherboard, which was probably 7 years ago (never bought Gigabyte again).

On that note, you will find a lot of brand loyalists in the PC building community. I am guilty of this, although I was a die hard Intel/nVidia fanboy for a long time and I'm currently using an AMD FX 8120 CPU and ATI Radeon 6870 video cards with great success. Find what works for you, and **read reviews before you buy**.

Good luck!","1375315404"

Luckily, my car has ABS, DSC, and traction control, so it was easy to avoid, but he then spent the next 2 miles harassing me from in front.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;why should we support this kind of business practice?

I think people at the other end of the business supply chain have no freakin clue how a business works.

A corporation like McDonalds - or any other shareholder owned business - exists to maximize its profits for the shareholders. Now shareholders is a scary term to most people, but its important to realize what shareholders are - they provide the initial capital for the business to run. McDonalds effectively ""owes"" the shareholders the return on the investment.

Think of it like this - You are a successful business owner, you pay your employees well, etc. The business is good and now you have 2 options - you can live the status quo, or you can expand. However to expand you will need more money - more than already have.

So who is in the position to give you that money? Investors. You go public, have a huge IPO, and you are rolling in cash. You can now afford to expand - and it works wonders! Everyone loves your business, and you are now making a lot MORE money.

And now the investors are richer too because of it, after all they get first dibs on the returns you make because they are the ones that originally funded you. They invest in you more and more because - you are making more and more profit, and the cycle continues. If they like you, they keep their money in your company, if they don't - they take it out. 

Given this state of affairs, it becomes obvious to maximize for profit. Now this does **NOT** mean to pay shit wages. If you can increase wages, and that increases profit, then good for you. But in the case of McD's, increases workers wages doesn't mean anything, so no one does anything.

Now to your last question: **why should we support this kind of business practice?**

At the end of the day, you don't support this business practice, shareholdes do. They have the cash, so they have the power. If profits were somehow effected by the low worker wages, shareholders would fight to increase worker wages.","1375315408"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Good is an adjective and describes nouns. Well is an adverb and describes verbs. This gets a little mixed up when using linking verbs. Verbs without direct action (Is, Are, Was, Seems, ect [compared to action verbs: swam, runs, climb, drive, ect]) can be described by an adjective.

Examples:

* ""How is the dog?"" They're asking about the dog, not his actions, so the correct answer is ""Good.""

* ""How are you doing?"" Do is an action verb, so the correct answer is ""Well.""

* ""How are you?"" are is a linking verb, so in this case it's acceptable to say ""I'm good.""

"running","t5_2qlit","Well, I think you can probably get your ready time down. For me, it doesn't really take any longer than with running: change clothing, put on cycling shoes, grab helmet and gloves (they are with the shoes), fill up water. Jump on bike. I guess I pump my tires up about once a week or so. I'm not really anal about it. I ride a touring bike, so if the tires a a bit under-inflated it really isn't a big deal.

I know what you mean about it being easier. I feel the same way. I can crush myself when I run. This is very hard to do on a bike for me. Maybe I'm lazy. Maybe running is just harder than cycling.  Maybe I'm more motivated to push it when I run, but I relax more on the bike.

Ultimately, none of this matters. You can't run any more (my sympathies there--I've basically given up running because my IT band has just been way too problematic. But I CAN hike and I can bike!)  Focus on what you CAN do. Be realistic about the running--you are giving up something that you love, and it is OK and normal to feel a sense of loss. Allow yourself to mourn the passing of this dear friend. But also be thankful that you have a bike, that you can ride and enjoy it. And maybe you can like hiking too...There are many paths to fitness and enjoying life.  Perhaps in giving up running you will find a new (or renewed) appreciation of some other activity!","1375315413"

As far as you know she left you before she banged the guy, so even if she had feelings for him before she did the right thing. What else should she have done for you? 

It sounds to me like she gave you plenty of reasons why she broke up but you're saying they're all ""pretense"" just because she went and fucked some other guy immediately after. 

Honestly, if I had a bunch of reasons to want to break up with my SO I'd be pretty much over the relationship by the time I ended it...so she had plenty of ""closure"" that you don't have because you weren't over it the way she was. So her fucking the other guy a few days later was because she wasn't attached to you for a long time before she ended things. It's like, it was the straw that broke the camel's back...it wasn't like she out of the blue decided she didn't love you anymore although that's how it feels to you. That's not how it felt to her.


&gt;""She told her parents that I was a drain on her time, money and energy and that she had had enough of me. She told me that she had to work on herself and be alone, that she needed to find her identity and really care for herself.""

Honestly it sounds to me like she let you down in the easiest way possible and these issues she addressed with her parents are the real reasons. Have you actually asked yourself honestly if you WERE a drain on her time, money, and energy?

I think she did you a favor by saying she needed time for herself. She could have been more honest and direct with you but for all we know she may have been. She might have told you what you needed to do to not be so draining on her resources but maybe you ignored that too, since you're saying now that her reasons for leaving are ""pretenses.""

Fred and George are my FAVORITE characters. I remember reading an article about the fact that when they were filming the death of Fred in the movie, the director cut but Oliver Phelps (who plays George) wouldn't stop crying because he was actually picturing James Phelps dying.

Also marketing is what convinces your mother to switch, obviously if that was a marketing strategy being used, it wouldn't be effective.

"LesbianWriters","t5_2y1vy","A couple of grammar and style pointers for you:

&gt;the *Soccer Team* bake sale

 The soccer team isn’t a proper noun, so no need for capitalization.

&gt;So here I am, *this flower spinning* between my fingers.

I would rearrange the phrasing to ‘spinning this flower.’ Otherwise it reads like the flower is spinning itself, instead of the narrator completing the action. 

&gt;“Thanks.” I *did not know* what else to say.

This sentence is a repetitious mouthful of mono-syllable words. I’d change the ‘did not’ into the contracted form ‘didn’t.’ The sentence will flow smoother and have some syllabic variety!  

&gt;I was stunned, a *me shaped* statue holding a flower.

This should be hyphenated to ‘me-shaped’ instead. By adding a hyphen, you signal that—together as a single unit—the two words are both working to form the adjective. (This is known as a phrasal adjective, for the curious.)

&gt;...called me strange for not *capitulating.*

This specific word choice strikes me as out of place. Based on the rest of your character’s word usage throughout the story, it seems too formal. I would replace it with a synonym that your character would be more likely to say. Ex: surrender - give in - yield - submit - succumb. 

Keep up the good work!","1375315418"

They held the old woman partially responsible for spilling the coffee on herself, only awarding her $160k to partially cover medical costs. 
 
However, due to the evidence that McDonalds had been trying to cover up a whole bunch of similar burn cases,  they decided to take punitive action against them as well.    
 
The award? $2.7 million. Sounds like a lot of money, right?
 
How did they arrive at that number? That's the profit McDonalds makes *from coffee* **over two days**.

"literature","t5_2qhps","Beckett isn't really trying to ""tell"" us anything, and that often is what gets people tripped us up on his work in my opinion. If anything, he often times tries to show absolutes of pain to indite them. Beckett is not telling us to take control of our lives; if anything, the play is about the necessity of continuing on despite our goals and control constantly being taken away, or even being illusory. Pozzo and Lucky are there both for laughs, and as ""bad examples""; Pozzo ""succeeds"" by making Lucky an abused slave, but in the end, they pass in and out of Estragon and Vladimir's conversation like everything else.

*Murphy* is a work of his that uses a lot more familiar comic techniques, but is certainly transitional to the period that begins with *Godot.* You might find it easier to read, but even so, it's kind of like the *Romeo and Juliet* effect; there's a lot there that's just there for laughs, and if you're only looking for ""deep""-ness, you'd be better off strapping in and just reading the Trilogy of novels. They're purely Beckett's own style (with some hints at Proust early on). 

Pozzo would be part of the Solipsism ""theme,"" which I admit, is more common in the other works. If it helps, Edna O'Brien has a fantastic short ""primer"" to Beckett in [this one article](http://web.archive.org/web/20060326090208/http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,,1727372,00.html) that mostly covers the later work.

Cleave doesnt work to dmg Weaver's scarabs, but hitting a scarab can make you cleave other normal units. So if you have cleave and is fighting weaver whom tries goes invis with low hp around you.. just hit the scarab and you might get lucky and kill him.

If you play Magnus and have Clockwerk Goblin on your team, blink in and ulti then skewer the enemies into Cw's cogs. Every enemy you caught will get manaburned, dmged and knockbacked.

Svens stun does only trigger linkens if you target the hero. Need to stun an enemy hero that has linkens? Just throw the stun on a creep or hero that is close to him.

You can afford to buy Circlet + Wraith Band recipe + Ring of protection and still have 130ish gold  left for reg. This is a decent starter for safe-lane as an agi carry, if you know the lane will be easy (let say trilane vs solo syllabear). It allows you to pick up slippers of agility and sobi mask from the sideshop to finish your Ring of Aquila without having to use the courier :)

Manta style has a small window when activated that allows you to dodge any spell with a projectile when you are being ""transformed"" into illusions.

Spells stolen by rubick does not have the spells normal cast-point. This makes for some spells being way more powerful on Rubick than on its original hero. For example: Leshrac stun and Fissure

MWO at the core has wonderful core gameplay and the technology behind is has really evolved (netcode, hit reg and movement code). A lot of changes were very good. Ghost heat wasn't and the stale meta game at the high end isn't very fun. The Devs have already stated that the 8-queue is failing to find a match at ~30 to 40% of the time. There are problems. They could be as easily solved as the SRM fix. Which was done against the wishes of Paul Inouye. And that FIX was the key to more brawlers. 

What we still need is something along the lines of more PPC Heat, lower PPC/Gauss RoF. Add some more hitpoints (more on lighter Mechs). And MWO is nearly perfect. Yes it's that easy.


The Ghost heat mechanic could still be used for a Mutator Gamemode (see how it's done in L4D2) to spice it up now and then. ","1375315440"

He's looking at how our basis of understanding is still grounded in faith, bloody good, accurate, constantly questioned faith but still faith. This I believe is also what OP is trying to discuss, how does the religious and scientific community differ in the FOUNDATIONS of their knowledge, not how they handle challenges to those foundations. This of course get's complicated fast since the things that the 'religious' community believe were almost all founded on principles before even the conception of the scientific method.

They will be a higher rank than what they deserve. Hence the ranking system isn't working. If I go 35-16 every game but still lose I will NOT rank up.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Needing a loan doesn't always mean you are living lavishly. I have had to take out a good amount of loans at a state school every year, because while getting the top amount of money for my high school grades/ACT score, along with the pell grant, I don't get THAT many scholarships. Plus my parents can barely pay their own bills, let alone help me, not that it's any fault of theirs. I lived on campus two years, earning my own money with an on-campus job to help buy my own new clothes, pay for eating out, paying part of my phone bill (I pay the extra data cost I added to the bill when I bought myself a smartphone), etc. My loans went to tuition and sometimes books when I didn't quite have enough.

I know that's not always the case at all (and that you don't necessarily mean that in all cases, don't get me wrong), but not all of us use loans for frivolous things. 

I probably could have gone somewhere cheaper and gotten a full ride (or close to it), and I hate having loans but I love my school and wouldn't trade my experience so far for anything.

I do agree with your last paragraph though. ","1375315445"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Mr Shanklin, I actually have a lot of respect for you.  I have a lot of respect for anyone who adopts voluntaryist views, because it shows intelligence, imagination, humbleness, etc.

I actually went through a period where I thought like you.  I hated statists, I hated all cops &amp; troops (I still do).  But I don't consider them enemies that deserve death (except in rare circumstances - probably far more circumstances than 99% of people out there).

I agree with you that socialism is a wicked disease of the mind that's hindering human progress and happiness.  I feel like I was born 600 years early, like I live in the medieval ages and everyone around me is barbaric and vindictive.  We will ultimately win this.  But the way to win is to propagate the ideology as much as possible.  It's how the early Christians spread their religion.  Be fruitful and multiply.  That means avoiding death, imprisonment, and government attention.  Keep a low profile.  Have lots of kids and raise them with voluntaryist ideas.

But if you get killed, imprisoned, etc. **you will be forgotten by history**.  You will just be another statistic.  Another skull on top of the mountain statists have already created.  Another warning sign to future rebels.  When I was in high school (government-run) learning history, we learned about a few ""anarchists"".  Most of them were actually socialists (with the exception of Emma Goldman).  But they tossed them in there to confuse us about true anarchism.  Basically we learned that anarchists are drama queens.  They throw themselves in front of horses and trains, bomb innocents, and generally flail around like muppets.  What brought me to anarchism was Ron Paul and Mises.org.  When I read Rothbard, the eloquence, intelligence, cogency, reasonableness, etc is what won me over.

You have to be more sly about how you convert people.  Don't just outright tell them the conclusion - ""All government is evil!""  You have to lead them to the lake you want them to drink from.  And that requires they follow you through the woods.","1375315446"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;  it is that the system doesn't give any room for people to change.

What they could do is set it up as an score. For each report you get (and are found guilty of by the tribunal), you lose a point. If you are at -5~-9, you'll get matched with people who have -5~-9, if you are at -10~-14, you'll get matched with people who are at -10~-14, and so on

Now, each... let's say two days (in which you have logged into the game), your score increases by 1 automatically, and for each ""friendly"", ""teamwork, ""helpful"" or ""honourable"" you get, your score also increases by 1.

That means that simply by playing and not being reported/not being guilty, you'll eventually get out of that place.

It could also have a positive score; someone with +5~+9 could, for example, receive 5% extra ip after each match. That would incentive players to strive for a positive atittude, so that they might reap the benefits. Of course, this score would also decrease at 1 per day playing, until it rested back at zero, and maybe a low cap, so that a player could not just accumulate +30 with his friends spamming him up and keep acting like a jerk.","1375315448"

* Organize a lan party with free pizza and soda at a university and have an open invitation; Give them codes, and record all data.
* Invite the interesting and committed people back, for more pizza and soda and games, maybe incentivize with a bit of cash or prizes for tournaments or draws for games and goodies.
* Find dedicated people willing to become pros, study that group's metagame through time.
* Personally ask highly skilled gamers from similar games to play.
* Do an online open beta that uploads play metrics. Participate in Feedback Friday.

After that it gets harder.

* Statistically analyze the data
* Extract valuable information
* Decide on rule changes

Then back to square one. The data you have is old. Acquire new data then extract valuable information then decide on rule changes.","1375315451"

I don't think I could narrow it down to two things. My grandmother (paternal) is the *most* amazing woman I've ever met in my life.  My mother walked out on my father, my four siblings and myself when we were all ages 3-12.  At that point, my gramma took early retirement (at a terrible loss), and dedicated her life to us.  I still feel terrible about it because so few people LOVE their jobs and she literally loved it...so much.  Anyway, my Dad had to work numerous jobs to support five children.  Therefore, my gramma cooked, cleaned, went shopping, took us to our extra curricular activities, and so much more.  She's a selfless woman who dedicated (and still dedicates) her entire life to her grandchildren.  Another great thing about her is how she's 79 and still gets around like she's 50.  She has cats, and chickens. She cleans the chicken coop, throws hay, plants an acre garden, mows her lawn and her neighbor's.  She knits and sews blankets and hats for the children and the veterans at the local hospital.  I went away to college, and my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer.  She didn't tell me, 'cause she didn't want me to stress and be distracted from my studies.  There's so much more, but I don't want to write all night.  I love her, with my whole heart.

The ones who would make new accounts are probably the same ones who switch accounts to make sure they aren't shadowbanned, since they know their comments should get some sort of response.

"mildlyinteresting","t5_2ti4h","Yeah certainly credit does aid productivity. I've also found that there are a lot of ways to get comparable results that are usually passed over by people. For instance, I recently bought my first vehicle, a motorcycle, cash down. The insurance is cheap (on the scale of an entire year of motorcycle is what you'd pay for a single month of car), maintenance tends to be cheap and loss common because they're simpler machines. There's also extra risks but something like 50 percent of all motorcycle deaths are due to intoxication and 45% were unlicensed, and 95% were self trained so if you're sober, took a safety course, and have a licence you're doing pretty well. Anyway, the thing is I do have transportation, and sometimes it's a little rough (wearing all my safety gear can be a bit of a bother sometimes) but in the end the money I save and put towards paying off student debt is better spent. 

I remember reading somewhere that the American electrical grid which was laid out as part of the New Deal is about 30 years overdo for an upgrade. It was only meant to last a number of years and we've exceeded that by a large margin. Something like 15% of energy in the wires is lost due to degradation I've read.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sorry, I think this has gotten a little off track. Your original comment was comparing modern perceptions of pedophilia with ancient Greek perceptions of pedophilia, right? Then someone responded to your comment, saying that it wasn't a very good comparison, and giving an analogy about the treatment of women, saying that just because we don't have records of women suffering due to the lack of rights, doesn't mean they didn't. Then you responded to *that* comment saying that ancient Greeks treated their women well.

I know you did not intentionally compare the treatment of women in ancient Greece positively against the treatment of women in modern times. What I'm trying to say is that A) that's what it sounded like, given the context of the conversation, and B) since that's not what you meant, the comment was actually completely irrelevant. To say that none of your statements came close to being a part of the bigger debate going on is to misunderstand how conversations work. You responded to a comment about the bigger debate with apparently relevant (though largely untrue) information. Perhaps your intention was for that to be an aside, but because it was directly relevant to the comment above it, which *was* part of the main debate, that's not at all how it came across.","1375315463"

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","You can give the player incentive to wear the pumpkin - whether via enchantments or attributes. Perhaps a MovementSpeed attribute modifier, as a light source would make you feel more comfortable running around?

You can even combine that with a debuff, i.e. have the player have the slowness effect at all times, so the pumpkin becomes the only way to move at normal speed. Imagine turning your flashlight off and being too scared to move.

It would be amazing if you could inflict the player with blindness status at any time when they aren't wearing their pumpkin-flashlight, but sadly that's only possible if this is a map where the player can't get hurt (i.e. you'd track the player's health, and have the pumpkin raise their max health). If it's a map where the player can get hurt, it may be a bit too cruel; blinding them when their health goes down to 10 hearts or less.

&gt;“The wicked know that if the ill they do be of sufficient horror that men will not speak against it. That men have just enough stomach for small evils and only these will they oppose. He said that true evil has power to sober the smalldoer against his own deeds and in the contemplation of that evil he may even find the path of righteousness which has been foreign to his feet and may have no power but to go upon it. Even this man may be appalled at what is revealed to him and seek some order to stand against it. Yet in all of this there are two things which perhaps he will not know. He will not know that while the order which the righteous seek is never righteousness itself but is only order, the disorder of evil is in fact the thing itself. Nor will he know that while the righteous are hampered at every turn by their ignorance of evil to the evil all is plain, light and dark alike. This man of which we speak will seek to impose order and lineage upon things which rightly have none. He will call upon the world itself to testify as to the truth of what are in fact but his desires. In his final incarnation he may seek to indemnify his words with blood for by now he will have discovered that words pale and lose their savor while pain is always new.” 


&gt;""Every man's death is a standing in for every other. And since death comes to all there is no way to abate the fear of it except to love that man who stands for us. We are not waiting for his history to be written. He passed here long ago. That man who is all men and who stands in the dock for us until our own time come and we must stand for him. Do you love him, that man? Will you honor the path he has taken? Will you listen to his tale?""

Most people born in rough areas are born more rough, those born in rich areas are more socially cultured and ignorant of others strifes. More often than not we're merely a byproduct of our surroundings, people adapt to be what they need to be. If I was born in a more violent world I'd grow up to be more violent, if I was born in a culture where rape was acceptable I'd more than likely be a rapist. People ignore that the mind is weak early on and can be coached to become nearly anything, we're less people and more animal than people want to admit. There's way too many people who are just followers, they hear what they hear and it is then there opinion. Think along the lines of all the pot smoking redditors, they are just byproducts of american drug culture, barely even considering they could be funding shit like this. They are adapting to get what they want, if they are buying drugs and supporting gangs and criminals that could be just like these guys in 20 years time they don't care. They just want there drugs, they just want to follow in the steps of the culture around them and sure they may have there own compassion now and again but more often than not they're just lucky that was a cultural thing too. 

People can be far more than what they are, honour, dignity, virtue, charity etc. But there's very few who are smart enough to mix that with a real distaste for crime. They'll buy there drugs because warning signs like these don't matter to them, just like the zetas who have bred there own horiffic criminal culture of ignorance.","1375315469"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","Narcissists are surprisingly superficial.  This was a very shocking thing for me to realize.  

&gt; The reason I say this - and you have probably experienced it, is when they are hurtful for so long but suddenly they are as kind as shit.

Yes, I know what you mean.  This can be done for various reasons.  Sometimes it is to reel you back in, because they realize they may have scared you off with their abusive behavior.  They need to lure you back, so they can kick you some more.  Sometimes, I think, it is done to keep a victim confused and accepting the abuse, so they can get the few treats the narcissist randomly doles out.  

&gt;Why lie then? When everything is going your way? When there wasn't any, well, gain in lying?

There is no gain that *you perceive*.  There is some gain that they perceive.  It may be something ridiculously petty.  It may be so that they can live up to the legend of themselves they have built up in their own mind.

I have seen narcissists shoot themselves in the foot over and over with lying.  They can't seem to help themselves, even when it is ultimately going to hurt them.

As for animation cancelling?  This isn't considered a bug in other games.  I don't see why it should be here.  The *animation time* is not the *reload time*.  If the actual *reload time* isn't shorter, you are not *abusing* anything to make it shorter.  It is not your fault that Hi-Rez can't sync reload times and animation lengths.

A better measure something like ""how wide is the rpm range where the bike makes 85% of it's peak torque"".  Also important is where that range starts.  For general street riding, making decent torque at low rpms, and having a wide rpm range where the motor makes torque is fairly ideal.  

To try to answer you stated question, 80nm is a decent amount of torque.  Not a huge amount, but more than enough to pull away from a stop light faster than almost any car in existence.","1375315474"

Other than him and the other two guys (safety Kiy Hester and WR Adonis Jennings), it's a good class, not a head-turning one though. Plenty of three-star guys, some good runningback talent to supplant Huggins in the backfield, and some reloading on defense, but nothing stellar other than our big three.

There are, however, some very big targets still out that we're hoping to reel in. We have most of the class filled up already, but if we can get a couple of our big remaining targets, we'll be easily pulling in the best class in school history. The biggest one we're gunning for is five-star offensive tackle Damian Prince out of Maryland, who has Rutgers on his top schools list (he also hails from the same high school as our top receiver Brandon Coleman, which will hopefully help our chances). Two other five-stars that Rutgers is pursuing are DT Thomas Holley and WR/DB Curtis Samuel, both out of different schools in Brooklyn. In addition, top NJ four-star RB/WR Noah Brown, from my rival high school in my hometown of Sparta, has Rutgers on his short list, though many see him as leaning more towards Ohio State and potentially Alabama. 

If Rutgers can snag anyone from that pool of Prince, Holley, Samuel, or Brown, it'll be a great class top to bottom. Pull in more than one, it'll be an amazing one. Get all four, it'll be the best we've ever had.

There's even a part of the game where the soldiers spraypaint a message on the wall saying ""DIE FREEMEN"" complete with the misspelling of your last name. 

When i beat that game I didn't understand the story so much... but I felt like I had gone somewhere and done something. There really hasn't been a game thats made me felt the same way since then and I still enjoy playing it today.

Lying to people about trying to get the pets adopted and then euthanizing animals in the back of a van out of a fishing tacklebox is anything but minimizing pain and distress, and dumping the bodies in trash bags is absolutely contrary to their professed belief to respect the dignity of animals.

"AllThingsTerran","t5_2tfht","NB - this is the opinion of someone in Silver :-)

I think Terran has to be played aggressively. You have to fight on your terms, in the places that you want to fight.

Although SkyTerran is powerful, I think AirToss is nastier, and the Zerg tier three units are also hard to deal with. Also, unlike Zerg, but like Toss, the Terran player has to spend a lot on production before they can get a high throughput of units. A big Zerg unit switch is very hard to deal with.

But what Terran does have is reapers for early scouting, and other options including scans, cloaked units, and flying buildings for later scouting. Terran also has medivacs, which are useful for most of the game. (I don't know if warp prism harass will become more standard in future, but Zerg only rarely put units in overlords.)

So builds aside, I think the Terran player's basic plan should be to put their opponent on the back foot ASAP, by dropping in weak places. They should stay aware of their opponent's tech and unit choices, and try to stay ahead of them.

As someone in the, err, less valuable leagues, I have to force myself to go attack, as I am sometimes afraid of the losses I'll suffer. But if you leave a two-base Toss alone, they'll just come over the top with carriers, colossi and archons after 20 minutes.

So more than any other race, I think you have to get in your opponent's face and stay there. Timing attacks and drop harass are your friends.

But I'm in Silver, so I'd be pleased to read other people's opinions :-)","1375315489"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Most OD pedals are placed before your amp's pre-amp section. (that is, between your guitar and the amp's instrument input, and NOT in the effects loop). Most people tend to put it after compressors. If you don't have an effects loop, the OD also usually goes before time-based effects such as delay and reverb. 

If you have a tube amp (which will really make the TS-9 shine), fiddle around with it for the best sound, but the most counter-intuitive setting on any overdrive pedal is to dime the volume/level dial and completely shut off the drive/gain dial. This will boost your amp into breakup, without coloring your sound too much.","1375315490"

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","&gt;And should I be putting in the crystal/honey malt in addition to the grains in the recipe, since they don't add ferementables?

To be clear, either of these *will* add fermentable sugars. They'll just *also* add a lot of unfermentable sugars which will contribute sweetness. They can either just be steeped, or added in with the 2-row and wheat malt in the mash. A lot of people feel that honey malt contributes a stronger honey flavor when it's mashed rather than steeped.

&gt;And the rice hulls...are they basically there to fluff the mash a bit, so that it extracts and sparges ok?

That's one of the purposes. Wheat malt doesn't have a husk around the endosperm the way barley does, and the husk from barley serves to form a natural filter in the mash tun to keep particulate out of the kettle. To compensate for the lack of a husk on 40+% of your grist, rice hulls are added. 

Some people find that this isn't actually necessary since wheat malt *does* have a pericarp that can act similarly to a husk in the mash. Honestly I rarely have trouble with wheat the way I expect to with rye, but it can still gum up and cause a stuck sparge if you aren't careful.","1375315490"

Against a melee lane, where you're already at an advantage, you're really not going to do anything different.

Against a lane that outranges you, you'll mostly want to build tanky enough to survive incoming damage, because your R will let you close the gap and melt their face off. If it's a burst lane, you just have to get a ton of health and MR to survive it (Archangel and BV are your best friends!), then go all out while their skills are cooling down. R will heal back a lot of the burst damage your took. In a sustained damage lane, like against a Marksman top or mid, use E for pokes (it still bounces, so you can still hit stuff outside the cast range). Wait for them to overextend, then use R for the burst of speed to rush into range for your root and try to burst them down.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Generally the go-to underwear is a thong because anything with more fabric on your ass is in danger of being seen, but that is mostly just for class. For performances you almost never wear any underwear. Why even risk interrupting the lines of your body with the lines of your underwear? It looks tacky and unprofessional, not to mention ruins the illusion and reminds people you're just human, not the magical swan or fairy you are pretending to be.

On the point of tampons vs. pads, you are correct in assuming tampons are really the only way. Do you really think a pad can cover it when you're doing a 2nd position split? Additionally many girls I know get their period very infrequently and irregularly, and very few I know choose not to get it all via birth control (though they probably have other reasons besides just it being impractical for dance).","1375315495"

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","When making preseason conference standing predictos, i really like to project which games each team will win.  Makes it more fun.

1. Oklahoma State 8-1 (@UT)

2. KSU 7-2 (@UT, @OSU)

3/4/5. Oklahoma 6-3 (@BU, @KSU, @OSU)

3/4/5. Texas Christian 6-3 (@OU, @OSU, @KSU)

3/4/5. Baylor 6-3 (@KSU, @OSU, @TCU)

6 Texas 6-3 (vOU, @TCU, @BU)

7 West Virginia 3-6 (@OU, OSU, @BU, @KSU, @TCU, UT) 

8 Texas Tech 2-7 (TCU, @OU, OSU, @WVU, KSU, BU, @UT)

9 Iowa State 1-7 (UT, @TT, @BU, OSU, @KSU, TCU, @OU, @WVU)

10 Kansas 0-9

-Oklahoma State will start the season 9-0 and be a legit nat'l champion contender.  Until UT derails that trip in Austin.

-OU will start the season 8-0 until they lose 3 out of their last 4.  Bob Stoops' britches are getting warm.

-This year's Bedlam game will decide the conference.  Much like 2 years ago, us K-State cats fans will be Boomering our collective asses off, but they'll let us down.  

-Total logjam in the middle.  UT was a solid team, but not solid enough to get the job done.  Unfortunately, playing @Baylor and @TCU is too much for a quality longhorn team.  6th place.  So long Mack. 

-Notice all the @s among the losses.  This projection has everyone ranked 6 or above holding serve at home.  That's pretty crazy, but i'm sticking with it.  Homefield is a huge, huge, huge advantage in the big 12 imHo.

-Disappointing seasons for GQ Swagger. ""I knew Mike Leach, and you sir are no Mike Leach!""

-KU goes 0'fer again, tying turn of the millenium Baylor for the longest losing streak in the Big 12.  Their only shot at winning was WVU at home, and well, what can I say?  KU just blew it.  Shame.  Maybe they'll take out ISU in 2014?

This is still a democracy. A democracy influenced by money, but still a democracy. When worse comes to worst, logic still always prevails to money if the money is trying to buy something real bad.

I think most libertarians, including myself, aren't very concerned with privatizing money in the short term because we realize it is not politically feasible and partially because the financial system is so corrupt. I also think most libertarians are for reasonable regulation of financial markets and I know that they are for harsher punishments of financial institutions convicted of fraud and other crimes. 

Another issue I think people confuse the libertarian position on is Citizens United and corporate political speech. I am not willing to say most but many libertarians are against citizens united. I think until we have corporate and financial corruption under control giving corporations unlimited political speech is near suicidal.

A big part of the reason libertarianism is not more popular is because people are misinformed about the predominant positions of libertarians. That and horrible leadership in the Libertarian Party.","1375315499"

Not doing work for or advising a party (even one who appears to be deserving of and clearly in need of legal assistance) does not make the court biased, it makes it impartial.  In this case, no one was harmed by the clerk's action, and I think that we should all be glad that an innocent man's name was cleared. However, one does not have to think to hard to come up with scenarios where a clerk's ""help"" could have troubling (or even disastrous) implications.  The court is the neutral balance in the middle of the legal system. I sure hope it stays that way. If you are concerned about overzealous prosecutors or inadequate post-conviction representation, the fix is not to have the court act on behalf of defendants, but rather to provide defendants with either better access to representation or simpler processes through which they can help themselves.

Just because they are more than that, does not mean that you can't have opinions about components of the relationship

&gt; She is not just a sexual object, but she feels worthless because she defines her worth to her husband as sex.

As I explained, this conclusion is projection. I read it about worry about how the relationship might affect her (in her sexual life and how much she could trust her husband) but you might be right. She also said she felt porn was degrading to women and this bothered her (presumably a trust issue again).

&gt;Her husband does the same damn thing she does, which is watch porn.

This point I understand. But what I am really arguing about here is not so much about her particular inconsistencies but - why shouldn't she allowed to have her own stance within her relationships? And why does this get labelled as ""illogical"".

&gt; Seriously, you don't respond by shutting away your emotion, quietly becoming more and more insecure, and eventually exploding

This wouldn't have worked in any higher divisions, but without coordination, the enemy team panicked. All 3 outer turrets went down. 3 enemies went bottom, but because of some amazing disengaging by our duo, their time was wasted as top lane and mid took out the inhibitor turrets. We continued to split push, and after a decisive teamfight, we pushed the rest of mid and top down and won. Easily the biggest comeback I've made, and it rocketed LoL to become my favorite game.

Quite the opposite:
You're arguing a business owner should cut back on expenditures, that's not the right model.   A business owner should raise his/her prices. If everybody else has to pay their workers more, there will be enough capital flowing to allow one's business to continue to prosper.

And no, that doesn't negate the reason to raise minimum wage: because the prices are higher, the margins are lower, and business owners are more likely to fail. Because thrifty people earning low wages now have more wages, they will be able to save up faster and start more businesses. The intent of lowering the minimum wage is to increase economic mobility, not necessarily just standard of living.

I'll recant my argument if you can cite an example when a raise in the minimum wage negatively affected the US economic mobility (or growth at all for that matter).","1375315520"

Downloading things straight to the pi should be straightforward if you sort out internet access. You say ""no LTE"" so I assume you mean when connected to Wifi?

Two Way Wifi is doable with one if you don't mind not doing it both ways simultaneously. Otherwise, I think you'll need 2 dongles, yes.

Bluetooth seems doable. See [this guide](http://rootprompt.apatsch.net/2013/04/23/raspberry-pi-network-audio-player-pulseaudio-dlna-and-bluetooth-a2dp-part-3-bluetooth/) for at least the audio streaming part.

The GUI will be somewhat dependent on the hardware, depending on if you were thinking of going touchscreen or not, how many features would be available via that display, etc. I was looking at a similar project and was going to use [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) for the gui bit.

So, ambitious, but not impossible.

You might take an approach from the 'agile development' land. Figure out a relatively simple feature you'd like to have, that would be useful to you if that's *all* you had, and get just that working. You'll learn a lot, and even if you decide to stop there, it'll still be useful.","1375315526"

How slow would the spin cycle have to be to be only 1g?  297 RPM.","1375315528"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Hey. &lt;3 I felt embarrassed when I was your age for weighing just over half what you do. I can't imagine how it feels. It must be taking a great toll on you. It sounds like you've already had just a ton to deal with, which sucks for someone so young. I also think you're in a situation where doing a few simple things, step-by-step, are going to greatly increase your chances of succeeding in fixing this particular problem.

**First**, I encourage you to reach out to someone you trust and tell them you want to talk with a therapist. A good therapist is basically just someone you can talk to. It's like having a good friend who doesn't ask anything of you. I think maybe that can move you in the right direction and increase your chances of success.


**Second**, marijuana is not a physically addictive drug. Knowing this... you gotta stop smoking it for now, man. Personally, the legality of the drug for consenting adults totally makes sense. But the studies are out there -- if you get into weed any younger than 20-21, you're going to suffer. Your mood regulation needs to develop, your hormones need to develop... everything needs to develop, and weed is screwing with it. By stopping the drug consumption, you are increasing your chances of success.


**Third** on the to-do list is dealing with hunger. At your age and size you shouldn't be dieting the same as someone who weighs 200 or 240 pounds. You gotta do it right. Calculate your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure [here](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/calculators/tdee-calculator.html) (be honest!) and subject 500 calories from it. That way you're still fueling your body while losing 1 pound a week. Start slow and count those calories using [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) or another calorie counter. By starting slow on your calorie deficit and upping the deficit as you gain confidence, you increase your chances of success.


**Fourth**, as for cooking being an issue, all you really need is a microwave. It's not ideal, but I live in a situation where I don't have a stove or oven, just a microwave. Lots of fish (which is great for you) is frozen and microwaveable. My friend introduced me to the Tyson Deli Market packaged chicken which are microwaveable. And in the absence of that, there is cold cuts, though they're not ideal. I recommend doing meat just once a day and making it fish or chicken. As for your grandfather... it's way easier to apologize than ask for permission. Just cook him a good meal and see how he feels about you cooking afterwards. Be persistent. It's worth getting this under control now. It's worth the work. You convince him you're willing to work, and you can get in on those grocery trips and control what's coming into your home.


**Fifth**, screw the idiots trying to get a rise out of you and get out and enjoy the summer weather. Even if it's walking to do your errands. Walk to the book/game store. Walk to the coffee shop. Walk to the grocery store. Walk to school. Walk circles on a track with music. It doesn't matter where. Low-intensity steady-state exercise like walking and power-walking is one of the best ways to reawaken your metabolism and lose the weight. Plus, exercise gives you a high -- you feel great afterward. I use the phone app [Cody](https://www.codyapp.com/) for exercise, but it's iOS only. MyFitnessPal, Fitocracy, or a number of others will also work for recording your progress. If you walk an hour a day, fuel your body with fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, and cut the weed, I can pretty much guarantee your chances of success as long as you continue to push yourself.


**Tips for dealing with hunger**:
WATER. Get your hands on one or two good, reliable water bottles and fill that sucker several times a day. I have a 24 oz water bottle, and I try to fill it 6 times a day. Water keeps you full, so you can more easily tell when you're having fake hunger pains and when you're actually hungry. There's a difference.

GUM. Chewing sugar-free gym keeps your mouth occupied and smelling fresh.

TEA. Tea is fantastic. Yogi makes a blueberry green tea that actually tastes delicious (I hate green tea, but this is good) and it has caffeine and other stuff in it that help your diet. I also drink their detox tea -- it has a bit of licorice, sarsparilla and other ingredients that can help make you feel better, taste some sharp flavors without eating, and feel full (even though I don't think it REALLY detoxes :P). Sometimes I do a chamomile tea an hour before bed, too.

SLEEP. Regulate your sleep. You're still young -- you should really, really be getting 9 hours a night. Chamomile tea helps. Don't look at screens for an hour before bed -- no cell phone, no laptop, no TV. Read. Reading just a regular paperback book helps a lot. Treat your body right and it will treat you right.

RECORD AND REFLECT. Keep a journal. I recommend at least starting with a written journal, so you can read it and turn the pages and feel the effort on the page. It can be about whatever you want. Your mood changes from day-to-day, how much exercise you're getting, food, all of it, none of it, doesn't matter. Just keep a record and don't forget you're on a journey.


This is a big journey. It's the journey of the rest of your life. It doesn't just end after a week, or a month. It took me years to realize that. I just want to let you know that, because it is hard. Your body will try SO HARD to trick you into thinking you've failed. When the scale stays the same. When it goes up. When all your friends go out to eat and you're at home thinking you're missing out on life. When you get an A on a test and you can't have pizza to celebrate. When you let a cheat day turn into a cheat week. When your body tells you, ""well, you already screwed up today, might as well just eat crappy for the rest of the day!"" We've all been there. It really sucks. But it's just your scumbag body, trying to justify eating like crap. Fight it with EVERY ounce of your being. Sleep it off. You'll get a new day to fight tomorrow. And you will conquer.","1375315531"

1. I'm a black guy, no that doesn't make me an expert by any means, but it gives context to my statement.

2. A lot of black guys don't care if their white friend (or friends of other races) say the word ""nigga"". However, ""nigga"" and ""nigger"" at this point have separate meanings. With the latter being much less common. Generally speaking, when someone says ""nigga"" it's a term ranging from neutral to endearment, whereas ""nigger"" (which requires more effort to say) is used when it's actually supposed to be a racial slur.

3. The reason behind that latter statement is that, at least in my experience and the experiences of the minority friends I have, ""Nigger"" is a term that's almost exclusively used by racist old men who think minorities are inherently ineferior.

Riley used ""niggers"". His teammates are probably going to have a problem with that. They know him, so the fall out won't be as bad as it could be, but he is gonna have some problems going forward.","1375315531"

They are actually separate things. Gnosticism speaks to what you purport to ""know"" and theism speaks to what you believe. So, for example, you could be a agnostic atheist, or a gnostic theist, or various other combinations.

The bottom line is: If you answer the question ""Do you believe in God(s)?"" with any response aside from ""Yes"", you are by definition an atheist. Now, you could be still be agnostic, but that's another question.","1375315537"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","You're assuming that purchasing narcotics on the street will be the same as it is now.  But it won't be.  Once you decriminalize the possession of meth and heroin, you don't have to go to a gang member to buy that stuff ... you just go to your corner drug store.  So to buy it ""illegally,"" you just buy from someone who went to the drug store last week.  What's to stop someone from going to the local Walgreens, buying a lot of meth, and then reselling it to their buddies at the local college?  Sure, that will be illegal, but it won't carry with it the same lengthy prison sentences that it has today.  It will be like selling unstamped/untaxed cigarettes or selling alcohol to minors.  By making drugs easy to acquire legally, you'll also make them far easier to acquire illegally.  So yes, I think a lot of 20-year-olds would rather buy from their frat buddy rather than go to the drug store, watch a 10-minute video on the dangers of meth, and sign a bunch of documents.  They'll want meth NOW and their friend will provide that.

No, indigent people do not get billed afterwards.  They either pay what they can (depending on the jurisdiction, up to 10% of their pay) or don't pay at all.  Medical bills in the U.S. are extremely high, so these costs end up getting written off by county hospitals, and the cost is passed along to taxpayers.

My point is that in the U.S., food is not just inspected, but adulterated food is not *permitted* to be sold.  A company cannot sell Salmonella infested meat, even if they label it appropriately.  Do you support current U.S. laws and regulations that forbid the sale of food that contains harmful substances like Salmonella, whether or not the food includes warning labels?","1375315538"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Good, you like government sources. Let's calculate affordability of houses, taking median house prices, median incomes, and 30 yr fixed rates, and see what % of monthly income it takes.

 - Monthly median and mean house prices cover Jan 1963 through Jun 2013 at http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/uspricemon.pdf

 - Historical median income from http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/, table H3, All Races, March of each year 1967 to 2011
 - Monthly fixed rate 30 year mortgage rates from 1974 through 2013 from http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.htm
 - Monthly CPI from Jan 1963 through Jun 2013 from http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0?output_view=pct_1mth

All reputable govt sources.

Median wage accounts for unemployment rates, job types, and job participation rate, so let's look at median wage versus median house prices, taking into account mortgage rates.

Now, looking at overlap of data, we can compute from 1971 through 2011. If you can find data for 2012 and 2013 then we'll do that too.

Compute monthly payment as a percent of monthly income, and we find for year and rate that we are at historic affordability. If people could afford houses in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, they can certainly afford them now. So it is a incontrovertible fact that houses are more affordable now than almost every year that I can find data for, and certainly through 1971. If you want I'll post the whole spreadsheet and you can check it yourself.

In fact, taking your 51K median income, the June 2013 median house price of $249,700 from the Census data, and the 4.07% June 2013 mortgage rate from Freddie, you get a monthly payment of $1202.20 which is 28% of income, a lower amount of monthly income than 41 of the past 43 years.

**In the past 43 years (since 1971), only two years (2011 and 2009) had a price lower than right now for a house when comparing median house price to median income, taking into account mortgage rates**. 

Care to extend this analysis or present more data and compute this yourself?

"books","t5_2qh4i","Look, I have no insecurities as a reader. I'm fairly well-read for my age and in fact, I teach literature. I'm well aware of ideas like intertextuality and allusions. I read A LOT and I like it when other people read a lot. 

I get very frustrated by people who put down other peoples' book choices. I think as a book-lover, one of the worst things you can do (and are doing) is make people feel bad about what they read and enjoy. No one should be made to feel inferior about their taste and when you claim a book like Harry Potter is lesser because of some criteria that doesn't matter to 90% or more of readers, that's exactly what you're doing. And if it's your only criticism of a book, your argument is quite weak. I don't disagree that books range in quality, but what about writing style, character development, pacing, tone, syntax, structure, historical accuracy, accessibility, dialogue, or symbolism? Does none of that matter to you? Because in many of those departments, Harry Potter fares very well. Are references really the only thing that matter? That sounds like a reader with really screwed up priorities. 

I don't know if you've read the books, but they are excellent stories that brought a lot of people to love reading. Furthermore, whether or not a book references other literature and whether or not you deem that as important, there is so much more than that to a book. If that's your only qualifier for whether or not to read a book, then I doubt you're the reader you claim to be. And while it may matter to you, most people just don't give a fuck about whether or not a book references the canon. Books are made to be enjoyed. You can enjoy them however you choose to, and if canon references are part of that, then good for you. But I remain unconvinced that it makes a book superior or that a book is lesser because it lacks them. 

For the record, I like a lot books that you would deem worthwhile. I read a fair amount classics and am, in fact, a great defender of teaching them in the classroom. I also enjoy a lot of mainstream stuff and YA fiction. I just think it's really shitty of you to go around acting like any book that doesn't reference other books is automatically a piece of crap, especially when you refuse to read them in the first place.

"politics","t5_2cneq","One of the biggest things that unionization is good for.

Look back on manufacturing jobs. Those weren't skilled labor by any stretch of the imagination. With very little variation, most were difficult steps broken down into easily performed tasks. Hell, I'd wager that most fast food workers work as hard if not harder than their grandfathers who worked for GM or Kodak or GE.

But, because of unionization, the collapse of the robber baron era of the late 18, early 1900s, and a shift in the ideals of business, we saw a huge middle class. Add in a world war or two which destroyed the manufacturing capabilities outside the US, and we had a recipe for growth and prosperity. Employees made fair wages, valued at what they did for the company. But now, it's all about bigger checks for the shareholders. And that's it.

And, even worse, thanks to greedy-ass baby boomers, who benefited from their parents and grandparents generosity in creating social programs and subsidizing their educations, have systematically stripped those programs because they don't want to fund them. These are the same people who have pushed the various versions of supply side economics onto the American populace.

And worse, it's getting popular again thanks to their children, who are too stupid to see that it's the same thing that's been destroying the economy for decades.

Few things honestly scare me, one of them being the impending economic collapse when the debt, low wages, and income disparity becomes too much and everything just falls apart.

Taken from Curtis Crabtree's practice notes

""Wednesday was perhaps the strongest day of practice so far from Wilson. He threw a nearly perfect ball up the right sideline to Tate over the outstretched arms of CB Brandon Browner for a touchdown in team drills. Wilson followed with a strike to WR Chris Harper up the right sideline as well.

Perhaps his most impressive throw came on an improvised play shortly thereafter. Wilson broke out of the pocket to his left and motioned for McGrath to go deep toward the endzone. Wilson threw a strike of approximately 65 yards on the money to McGrath in the endzone, but S Earl Thomas raked the ball out of McGrath's hands at the last moment.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","&gt; It's common notation for third base line extended.[1] If you ever had any umpire training, you would recognize it, but you don't know the simplest things about umpire mechanics, so you don't.

No I don't have umpire training... The condescension is funny though. Talk about sounding like an 8 year old. Terribly sorry that some of us actually play the sport. (See, I can condescend too).

As far as your videos go, apparently you didn't watch them yourself. First video, catcher isn't blocking the plate. The throw is inside, he dives across to try and tag the runner. No blocking of the umpire's view at all, he's good.

Second video, the catcher is ONCE AGAIN on the inside of the plate. Not blocking the plate from the umpires view AT ALL.

Third video, umpire does exactly what I said they should do. Don't really know how you though that one was a point in your favor.

Fourth video, if the runner tries to slide instead of trucking Posey, the ump would have been miserably out of position and would have had a very difficult time making a good call. 

Your last video isn't even the home plate ump calling it. It's the first base umpire who obviously wouldn't have had enough time to get over to the other side anyway. So again, makes no sense.

&gt; Just stop. Take a breath, admit you didn't know how play at the plate mechanics work at the major league level, and learn something.

Dude, you realize this only makes you sound like a total and complete fucknut right? Doesn't help your argument in any way.

&gt;I agree with you, 3BLX is a bad starting point for umpires 

And then you continued to condescend and tell me that I know nothing? So in essence you're saying that you also know nothing. Solid logic there, chief.

As far as your MLB mandates go, calling a play from the right side of home is only viable in swipe tag situations. On a play where it looks like there will be a collision, the umpire is supposed to move towards the third base side of home. That's the rule I've found on site google spit back at me when I looked this up.

&gt;but that is what MLB mandates the umpires do so it's stupid to criticize just Jerry Meals when every umpire has been doing the exact same thing for years.

But it's clearly not. None of the plays you posted proved anything you were arguing. The only play that was similar was the Posey play, and he could make an easy call because the ball got knocked out. You can see the umpire flinch and panic when the collision happens, jumping to the right to get out of the way. He wasn't moving into position, he was flinching and, according to your own precious umpiring rules that even a cursory google search showed you're wrong about, he was out of position on that play.



EDIT: Case in point, the Sox game tonight. Watch the sac fly play. Catcher's blocking the plate, what does the ump do? HE MOVES HIS ASS TO THE 1BLX TO MAKE THE CALL.","1375315550"

"EDH","t5_2scee","Well if you're just starting out, you have a lot of learning ahead of you.  I'd recommend following the template I laid out with probably the Mimeoplasm as general.  You're going to want a few black wrath effects (Mutilate, Black Sun's Zenith) which will help immensely versus indestructible humans and Krenko.  A few black tutors will help you find these, and a selective amount of counterspells will help stop the Niv-Mizzet guy's most powerful cards.  That said, remember, the goal in a four-player game isn't to be the most powerful -- it's to win.  A lot of times the strongest player gets killed by the other three, and there's a huge art to the politics.  I'd recommend trying to keep your budget under $100 for your first draft, and then spend the remaining $80 as you figure out cards to cut or add.

Actually, the only cards at this point you should spend more than around $2 on are going to be the ""shocklands"" (e.g. Breeding Pool), since you can get them with Farseek and other such cards.  Further, there is no EDH deck that doesn't want those, so they're a reasonable investment.

Also, that ""the workers drove Fords they built themselves' line enshrined Ford as the 'car or truck of the American people', a concept they still use and hearken to with their 'built Ford tough' concept. 

In general, stimulating an economy (speaking in insane generics) requires money to move through the economy. If the money is all pooled in one location and does not circulate, than there is no elasticity to allow for growth. Think of it as starting a fire through friction. The stick must move freely and vigorously (like the money through the economy should) in order to produce an ember (new products/innovations) that can spur a fire (economic growth). 

TL;DR Ford hated unions, and paid well to ignore them. The workers buying cars was probably true, but has been spun by ad-speak for years. Economies must be fed the blood of virgins... no, wait... that's Cthulu. ","1375315554"

I don't think this is true, although you make it sound like it's quite logical. The fact is that if you have really high sensitivity, then you're limiting what parts of your body you'll use. In long term, this could cause some injuries, because moving the wrist to the sides while keeping the forearm still is not healthy. But, assuming that you can avoid injury, you're still limited to wrist movement and finger movement, because anything bigger will be too much.

The thing is, with lower sensitivity, you don't just use bigger muscles to move your arm, as that'd indeed be slower, as you say. But this is not what happens. What actually happens is that you use *more* muscles in combination, which in theory (I say in theory because of course it depends on the skill of the player) you have more resources to both be precise when needed (by using less muscles) and just as quick as someone with higher sensitivities for any practical purposes, simply by involving larger muscles in combination.","1375315555"

&gt;The problem of the contribution of cosmic rays to climate change is a continuing one [we don't know] and one of importance [could be significant], In principle, at least, the recent results from the CLOUD project at CERN provide information about the role of ionizing particles in ’sensitizing’ atmospheric aerosols which might, later [later as a caveat?], give rise to cloud droplets.

In other words ""we don't claim to know but this could be important and the results are consistent with GCR's being an inherently important catalyst to aerosol formation.""

&gt;Our analysis shows that, although important in cloud physics the [CLOUD] results do not lead to the conclusion that cosmic rays affect atmospheric clouds significantly, at least if H2SO4 is the dominant source of aerosols in the atmosphere. 

While they say that it does not lead to the conclusion, they do not rule it out either.

&gt;An analysis of the very recent studies of stratospheric aerosol changes following a giant solar energetic particles event shows a similar negligible effect. Recent measurements of the cosmic ray intensity show that a former decrease with time has been reversed. Thus, even if cosmic rays enhanced cloud production, there would be a small global cooling, not warming.

Maybe looking at a single event is not the best way to rule out GCRs being non-negligible on this or any other timescale. 

Here's a more recent paper finding a significant (though ""small"") relationship with cloud cover

http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/10941/2010/acp-10-10941-2010.pdf

Interestingly, that abstract starts with ""The effect of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) flux on Earth’s climate is highly uncertain.""

Besides, the CLOUD team leader, Kirkby, says as I quoted above ""You have a cooling effect with certainty. But we have no idea how big this effect is. It might be small, but also very large. Maybe it is so large that it compensates for the effect of additional CO2 in the atmosphere. We do not know."" Surely he is the best authority on their findings?

"Games","t5_2qhwp","A little late to the comment party but I wanted to add my opinion on the subject.

I get the feeling people's threshold for what irritates them has been overly sensitized over the last decade. I love Bioshock. I can't explain what it is. I freaking hate horror! I hate scary movies, I don't ride roller coasters, I get legitimately pissed when my girlfriend takes advantage of the fact and constantly scares me day to day.

On a whim years ago I had no money and no games to play and my roommate just happened to borrow a copy of Bioshock from a friend. He hadn't even played it and it had been almost two weeks since it was in the house. I figured, what the hell and popped it in. Well, years later I can't explain my fascination with it but I am just crazy for Bioshock. I had an emotional reaction when I beat Infinite. I have never in my life experienced that feeling and it's hard to describe. I beat the game, looked at the credits, put my head in my hands, and I cried for a good 5-10 seconds. I have no clue why. If I had to guess I would just say that the sum of all the parts was greater then my mind could handle and I had to let some of the pressure out.

With that said I have been well aware of the Season Pass and choose not to purchase it. I choose to pay full price for them separately because I think they deserve it. I bought Clash last night and have yet to try it, but that doesn't matter I already know I'm going to love it. Bioshock Infinite is one of the most beautiful and engaging experiences I've had. I legitimately loved the combat system, I thought it was great. Max Payne 3 still holds the record for the absolute best gun play in a game I've played (shooting people in that game feels strangely great, the guns physics and the way the enemies react is unique) but Bioshock Infinite was still top shelf. I'll gladly choke down some more any day. I'd pay ten bucks just for the voxophones alone.

Now, would you all kindly stop and appreciate the fact that if your a Season Pass holder you still would have saved $5.00 overall and $10.00 if you didn't want anything to do with it. It's essentially free and it's primary focus is to stop the gap in time between now and when the Episodes hit, hence it being directly called a ""stop-gap"" by King Bioshock himself.","1375315564"

You can play terran many ways, marine/tank or mech or marine/mara or marine/wm or marine/mara/wm and you can throw helbats into the last two for vs zerg

vs toss it's mainly marine mara or some mech comp. with ghosts vs templars and vikings vs cols. Not sure if people use helbats anymore.

 vs terran it's mainly marine/tank with or without mara or marine/mara or helbat/tank/viking with thor if you need help wit air superiority (dont mass vikings) 

and ravens and thors and helbats get thrown into comps depending on what you're doing and the point of the game. Turtling till mass ravens bc is a thing. You can really do a shit ton of shit with terran.

edit: mech is basically vs zerg, helbat/tank and some thors usually only needed if he makes mutas(good idea to get like 4 incase they try a switch as most will) and ravens are a good late game unit for killing swarmhosts and hsm shit. Also, pdd blocks mutas if they mass mutas.

vsprotoss you need thors and vikings for sg and a lot of tanks for gateway, helbats are buffer units so you want to retain gas units. need ghosts if he gets templars and might want them away way, ravens are good for pdd and hsm clumped vrs. I dont use wms much but pretty sure they are useful when going mech vs protoss iunno really. ","1375315567"

You can interpret the events of Holy week any way you like.  But the Jews wanted Him dead, and the Romans didn't cooperate.  They wouldn't have gone to the Roman government except the authority of the Jewish courts didn't extend to capital punishment.  They needed Roman permission for that.

But Pilate didn't even want the case.  He found a loophole that gave Herod jurisdiction.  Herod found Jesus not guilty, and returned Him to Pilate.  Pilate was not going to enforce the laws of the Jews.  He knew he was wrong, but he  feared losing the confidence of Rome more than he feared making an unjust sentence.

You can spin the events all you want to make Jesus look like a seditionist.  But nobody appointed by Rome found anything wrong with Him.","1375315567"

This relates to edgy, unpleasant stuff in the kink and pornographic fiction communities as well: when do you go from your kink is not my kink to your kink is not okay to your kink should be illegal? It's regulation of drawings, words, and fantasy. Either side of the fence makes me queasy.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","yes, and it hurts my soul

why does nobody care that the current FPS standard alienates me? and I'm not alone. and I'm most definitely not a hardcore gamer. I hate that word. I just like a type of game that nobody makes anymore.

and I do know why, but every time me or someone smarter than me points it out, it gets drowned out by bullshit reasons why the modern standard is perfectly fine

when it's actually kinda really quite horribly broken on the most basic level. Because all they're making anymore are console shooters. Take 8 buttons and 2 analog sticks and you have to remove dozens of well-working mechanics because the input method of specified home hardware can't handle anything resembling finesse. And it reflects in the gunplay, level design, resource management, variety and a million other nuances; and they dealt with those glaring problems mostly by reducing everything to a bare minimum of functionality.

and that drivel becomes ""best shooter"" and ""best game"" all the time, but something like this, which used to be perfectly well-liked for all the right reasons, is now ""niche"" and will never make a big impact anymore, even though it almost objectively plays a thousand times better (the type, even if not RoTT specifically). It's just that nobody notices because everyone's used to that one type of shooter. It's like if BitTrip Runner was the only kind of platformer still being made and everyone's fine with that.

Sixty fields per second is sixty distinct pictures per second. This provides high temporal resolution. Moving objects are captured every 16.7 milliseconds, which translates into smoother motion. This makes a huge difference is sports, but is also perceptible even in content with slow moving imagery (e.g. soap operas).

The engineers who came up with NTSC were smart enough to know that images that are 16.7 milliseconds apart will have an advantage in temporal resolution over 30 Hz video that is non-trivial to the human visual system. However, 60 Hz created more demands on the video cameras, the CRT's and communication channels (i.e. bandwidth) than does 30 Hz.  They could have solved the problem by operating at reduced resolution, but they were clever enough to come up with a different compromise.

With interlace, two sequential images are captured with a slight spatial offset. For imagery without motion, this has the effect of providing spatial resolution equivalent to the pixel count of *both* fields added together. For imagery that is moving, the spatial resolution drops to that provided by one field. But the temporal resolution is 60 Hz. This compromise works well since the human visual system also has spatiotemporal limitations. Fast moving objects are seen as blurred by the human visual system, so less spatial resolution for moving images is a tolerable limitation in a video system.

A format that provides thirty progressive frames per second doesn't have the clever spatiotemporal tradeoff of sixty interlaced fields per second. For stationary imagery, they have essentially the same spatial resolution. But for moving imagery, 30p formats will have motion artifacts. 

With respect to terminology, saying interlaced video simply consists of ""interlaced frames"" is not technically incorrect, but completely misses the point. In the analog world, interlaced fields were captured separately, stored separately (on tape), displayed separately, etc. In fact, there are different conventions for how to compose an ""interlaced frame"". Some equipment is ""top field first"", some is ""bottom field first"" and some equipment is configurable for either. In an analog editing environment, mixing up these two conventions is considered ""bad"". But the mere existence of these two conventions makes it clear that interlaced video is composed of *fields* and that *frames* are  an arbitrary construct.

As video transitioned to digital in the early nineties, there were those who wished to discard the concept of interlace (especially in ITU-T). This was a well-intentioned idea, but was impractical for a variety of reasons (which are left as an exercise for the reader). In order for video compression to work effectively with interlaced content, the concept of ""field pictures"" had to be included in compression standards. (Yay MPEG committee.) So a old 60 field per second analog signal could very well be shared today as 60 compressed field pictures per second.

For relatively stationary imagery, compression standards also included the ability to do frame-based compression of interlaced content. I've never seen a system that does frame compression of interlaced video using the ""bottom field first"" convention, but I don't know that it's excluded by the various standards. All the equipment I'm familiar with is top field first.

Video compression standards typically have adaptive field/frame encoding, but they vary in details. I'll skip that topic for simplicity.

Getting back to terminology, it doesn't make much sense to speak of ""fields"" with respect to video that is inherently progressive. (The weird corner case is 24 fps or 25 fps film transferred to NTSC or PAL, but that's increasingly becoming ancient history.) For content captured, produced, transmitted and displayed in progressive formats, it's never in a field format. That would simply be a lot of work with no benefit whatsoever.

To summarize:

Interlaced video consists of 60 (or 59.94 since the introduction of color to NTSC) interlaced FIELDS per second. There are conventions for treating two consecutive fields as a frame, but fields are the basic building block. (Oh, and it's 50 Hz in some parts of the world.) Interlace provides a nice tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution that is convenient when bandwidth is limited. 

Okay, on to the issue of display. Almost all displays being built today are progressive. A lot of content is still interlaced. What to do? The makers of televisions include de-interlace capability in the display. The makers of computer displays do not. (At least I've never seen one that does, unless it was a TV/monitor combo.)

In the TV signal path, there are sometimes multiple options for de-interlace. The broadcaster may de-interlace interlaced content carried on an otherwise progressive channel (1080i or 480i commercial carried on a 720p channel). Some satellite or cable boxes may have de-interlacers. Most TVs do. Doing de-interlacing well is a hard problem. Some de-interlacers suck. Just taking two fields of interlaced video, sticking them together as a ""frame"" and displaying them on a progressive display would be characterized as a de-interlacer that sucks ass.

Because of the de-interlacing issue, content intended for consumption on computers, tablets and phones is NOT transmitted in an interlaced format. Interlaced content is de-interlaced somewhere along the way (e.g., interlaced content uploaded is automatically de-interlaced during ""preparation"" by the video hosting service). Increasingly, content is presented over the internet is 30p, for a variety of reasons.

* the hardware and/or the software of the client doesn't know how to deal with 60 fields per second
* the bandwith required for 60 progressive frames per second is too high
* people involved in ""internet video"" don't understand that 30p ain't the same as 60 fields per second
* people involved in ""internet video"" don't have trained eyes and are unable to grasp the plainly obvious and horrific artifacts caused by low temporal resolution (hell, a lot of companies still use CMOS sensors for video cameras despite the horrible ""jello vision"" caused by non-simultaneous capture of pixels (unlike CCD sensors))","1375315594"

Actually, there is plenty of research to suggest that even the most insignificant similarities in identity lead to preferential treatment and group-mind.

[Social Categorization and Intergroup Behavior](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420010202/abstract) (Taifel, Billig, Bundy, &amp; Flament, 1971), for instance, showed that people automatically become attached to even a completely arbitrary descriptor; boys were tasked to estimate the number of dots in clusters that were displayed briefly on a screen in front of them. Afterwards, they were randomly told that they were an over or under-estimator. Following that, the boys were asked to distribute small sums of money to two other boys, one from each group. Invariably, they gave the boy from their group more money. 

In fact, they did this even when it meant their boy got less money overall (e.g. they chose to give their boy 5 cents and the other boy 1 cent as opposed to giving both 6 cents, the numbers are made up but that's the gist of it).

Meanwhile, belief (or lack thereof) in god is not an arbitrary identity. It is something that people care very deeply and very personally about. It stands to reason that, in the right context, these people would band together to ""fight the other side"", as Maalouf would say. 

&gt;So... Christians? Muslims? Such people don't usually just call themselves ""Theists"".

When I refer to a type of identity, such as ""theist"", it should be apparent to you that I am referring to any such identity that could be classified as such. It doesn't matter if they call themselves that; they fit into the category of what I'm describing. Ultimately this is a silly question on your part because specificity in this instance merits us nothing; I could enumerate, in great detail, everything that could make one considered a ""theist"", but it would not change what I had said, nor would it provide to you any additional illumination, because you already know what such enumeration would entail. 

&gt;Regardless, the point stands. There have been no lynch mobs for people who believe that the earth is flat, that the moon landing was a hoax, that 9/11 was an inside job, and so on and so forth. Fringe beliefs are extremely common. It is not nearly enough for you to suggest that belief in god could become a fringe belief. You have to explain what cultural force would drive the population to attack people for it when they don't attack people for other fringe beliefs.

They don't attack people for other fringe beliefs? There is daily judgment of these people. Buzz Aldrin punched a guy in the face, for crying out loud. Keep in mind what I actually said:

&gt;there will be lynch mobs (or, more likely, disenfranchisement) for theists

More specifically:

&gt;(or, more likely, disenfranchisement)

I'm not necessitating lynch mobs, and on the other hand it is very obvious that these people are judged harshly. Imagine trying to run for office as a flat earth society member, or a moon hoaxer; you'd be laughed out of town. 

In any case, the driving force for something to become part of our identity is that we feel threatened because of it. 

To quote Claude M. Steele again, ""I am thus proposing something simple: the sense of having a given social identity arises from having to deal with important identity contingencies, usually threatening or restrictive contingencies like negative stereotypes about your group, group segregation of one sort or another, discrimination and prejudice, and so on, all because you have a given characteristic"" (p.74, *Whistling Vivaldi*)

Even the stupidest, most arbitrary threats (for instance, the 'threat' posed by the other arbitrary group of boys) are enough to lead us towards discrimination and the adoption of a social identity. Indeed, even the minor differences between the gnostic atheists and the agnostic atheists are enough to make them group together and go out to ""fight the other side"". 

Could that become a lynch mob? In the right cultural context, there's a possibility. I'm sure you're familiar with blood feuds, for instance. These are cases where distinct groups become engaged in violence against one another solely because of their identities. The right kind of spark can set that situation off. Similarly, this is reflected in the conditions of gangs today, the mob wars of old, the lynch mobs of the past, and so on.

These, however, existed in cultural contexts where violence was rampant. Will this be the case at some point in the future? I do not know.

However, it is also worth pointing out that violence has been directed from atheists towards theists in the past. Consider the Soviet Union, for instance: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union

Those policies, I think, show that atheists are not immune to the same sort of mindset that leads to violence against themselves.

&gt;My point is that you already said you ""know"" that some gods are not possible. From the perspective of a person who believes in a god that you ""know"" doesn't exist, you and I are no different. Why would my perspective be more likely to result in this person's persecution?

The importance of a grey zone is that it provides the ambiguity necessary for contrasting identities to avoid feeling threatened by one another. When I see an indication that a person is a theist of some kind, I don't automatically assume that they are wrong, because (not knowing what their beliefs are) they could hold a rationally consistent worldview. You don't, for instance, assume that every religious person you meet is a fundamentalist. 

They have the safety of ambiguity. We don't have to clash in a ""don't ask, don't tell"" sort of way; I have no reason to assume that they are wrong, and thus think less of them, and they have no reason to assume that I am doing such. This prevents the threatening of either identity that tends towards social strife.

In your case, in your worldview, you would assume that they are wrong.  There's no identity safety in that situation. It creates an identity contingency that they have to deal with (specifically, your judgment). 

Or, to tie back to previous things that I've said, it helps to prevent the development of a ""the other side"" dynamic in our society. When the groups are less clearly defined, ""the other side"" still exists, but is much less powerful of a concept. Additionally, as I quoted before:

""For it is often the way we look at other people that imprisons them within their own narrowest allegiances. And it is also the way we look at them that may set them free.""

When we provide people with identity contingencies such as our judgment (something which you are much quicker to do than myself), we set the stage for their identities to become more important to them. The lines between groups become clearer, people hold that part of themselves closer. 

&gt;Your argument for possibility of a god hinges upon it being broad and ill-defined, but individual people believe in narrow and specifically defined gods, usually ones who have intervened directly in our history. These people don't care if you accept the possibility of a god they don't believe in.

I have met and know many individuals who have concepts of god that are not so flawed. If you have met only this other kind of person, then that is unfortunate.

Left Click = FoT

Right Click = Sweeping Wind

'Q' = Exploding Palm

'W' = WotHF

'E' = Mantra

'R' = Blinding Flash


The first question you should ask yourself is whether you are used to using right click all the time, for some, like me, I can't use it that often, it hurts. If it doesn't hurts for you, ALWAYS use FoT on right click so you don't accidentally pick up loots. If it hurts, then put the least use skill there, which is sweeping wing.

The most important thing is to have WotHF, Mantra and Blind right next to each other, you want to be able to press these 3 very quickly just like the CM Wizard 123, you want to put WotHF on 1, mantra on 2, and blind on 3 because of the timing. Then in the future, you will never forget to press them and it's the BEST way to press them. having one of them on right click will loss maybe 1/4 of the seconds and over an hour fight, you can lose a lot of times.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Student loans in Canada are fairly forgiving (from the government, not the bank), and a student debt for a college education will be tens or thousands less and paid off much faster than a university loan. 

For example, my sister went to university, graduated from her program with honours, and now works as a night supervisor/pharmacy tech in a popular pharmacy store and has a ~40K debt, from the government loans. I am going to college, shorter program, and will likely not graduate with honours. I will only have ~20k in debt, if that, and I will be able to get a job in my field much faster than her. 

Still, she is in 'repayment assistance tier 1' and so her payments are smaller than they normally would be, though she can still apply for another loan. Soon she will be in 'tier 2' which means she can't take out another student loan, but she will also get to pay much less per month and will have a chunk of her debt removed. 

Additionally, while I am in school, my loan does not gain interest, nor does it during the summer months between semesters.

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","When you say ""road bike"" are you talking about for racing or just for riding around town? You can get a fine working bike on Craigslist for $500. You don't need clipless pedals and shoes unless you are a real road warrior. Get some cages if you want the more secure feeling. Don't try to put together something yourself, it will be more expensive (imagine building a car from parts). 

I don't know where you live or what your size range is, but here are some Seattle examples:

Worry less about the brand and component set and more about how it fits and feels on you.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt;You frustrate me. My patience is great but not infinite. I have shared quite a bit with you, and ultimately my patience ran out when you started blowing off my scientific arguments.

When I started blowing off your scientific arguments? I have tried to respond to most of your arguments, but I am not a perfect being. If you would communicate clearer what it is that you find inadequate about my arguments, I could've addressed it sooner. 

However, as I expressed earlier, my frustration is that you don't express these things clearly. Most times you respond to great lengths of my writing with short, single sentences. When I pressed you many times to revisit a certain subject or else to respond to one of my questions, they went unanswered. 

&gt;The checkmate argument I have is that scientific theories are considered knowledge despite the fact that they have exactly the same flaws as knowledge that there is no god, namely that we have no way to know that we've done enough experiments or the right experiments. Your argument for what makes them different is ultimately arbitrary and subjective.

Again, this is dismissive. You say my arguments are arbitrary and subjective, but you responded to them with, for instance, this post:

&gt;Hopefully that will shed some light on that subject.
&gt;More than you know, but probably not in the way you think. It demonstrates clearly that you've not listened to a word I've said and that you'd rather just attack a strawman.
&gt;And then that business about atheist lynch mobs... can you pass that shit over here? It must be strong.

And meanwhile my post before it was ten times longer. You never provided your argument for this; instead, you ignored me.

My distinctions for knowledge are not arbitrary. If we take your argument at face value, it implies that there's no distinction between knowledge and an assumption, which, as I've said before, is not a solid basis for knowledge.

Scientific theories have, in general, objectively fewer flaws than the argument that there is no god, as I have demonstrated time and time again (and to these demonstrations you also have rarely responded directly). There are more observations, more sound (i.e. more tested) reasoning, and fewer logical errors (for instance the ones you didn't address despite my pointing them out several times). 

If you want to ignore the concept that an argument can become more refined and less flawed, you must admit that your sense of knowledge is basically meaningless. 

&gt;Furthermore, you demonstrate lack of scientific understanding and then condescend to me when I try to educate you. Repeatedly you back your way out of saying something inaccurate or something that fundamentally misrepresents the problem by accusing me of just getting bogged down with semantics. Well, semantics are important. It is how you are understood. If you don't use the right words, how am I to know that you are speaking imprecisely rather than incorrectly?

Your tone has consistently had condescension. As I elaborated upon earlier, my frustration is that you take these ""knowier than thou"" stances that serve no purpose here to progress your argument. The only reasoning I can see is to make yourself feel better, when, for instance, you call me stupid for not understanding an irrelevant and technical distinction between two ideas, despite that fact that you clearly understand to which one I am referring. 

When I express my frustration over semantics, it is for that reason. It shouldn't matter to you if I write ""disproof"" one time instead of the lengthy ""provides reason to doubt the certainty of"", when, if you had been reading my argument, you would understand with what meaning I meant the word. It shows to me that you're only skimming for irrelevant things that you can condescend to me about instead of attempting to process what I'm saying, especially in combination with the fact that you proceeded to ignore most of my arguments after pointing that out.

&gt;And furthermore, the scientific argument I gave is airtight. I pointed out all of its flaws, showed how knowledge is fundamentally limited, and put knowledge in a consistent context. That you continue to give semi-coherent rebuttal suggests to me that you misunderstand something I've said. Either you misunderstand what I classify as knowledge, or you misunderstand what it means for us to be confident in a scientific theory (this much seems apparent)... or perhaps something else. It's hard to know what it is when you come back speaking about science as if you are an authority and then proceed to say profoundly unscientific things.

That you continue to ignore my ""semi-coherent rebuttals"" shows to me that you have no real defense to them. Your faith in your ""airtight"" argument is blinding you from your obligation to refine, reconsider, re-examine, etc.

You have an obligation to hold your scientific philosophy, as well, to those acts. Because what I say is not strictly science does not mean it is strictly wrong, or that there is nothing of value to consider within it.

 I have asked you to explain your beliefs so that I could better understand your arguments. You did so for a while, but then apparently became frustrated with the fact that I did not automatically know everything about your system of knowledge, or your beliefs, or whatever else. If I misunderstand something, surely it would've been cleared up if you had not become so smugly uncooperative with me.","1375315602"

"cad","t5_2qwha","I was confident in my solid modeling and drawing after about 3-6 months working, and surfacing a bit after that.  I had a year of classes before getting a job while in school, which really only served to teach some of the commands.  CATIA was the first parametric program I used, before that it was just Autocad.

The parts i'm working with are all injection molded plastic, small interior components.  The problems with surfaces a lot of times its tangency issues so I have to disassemble them and rebuild the bad parts of them, then fix the issues caused by the disassemble command to the customer's tolerances, then check the part for rapid inflection and ""ripples."" Then I make the B side and solid model the rest of the part.

I think if you are designing parts currently in another system, once you learn the commands and how things are structured / linked in CATIA you will be okay.  I've never used solidworks, but I started using UG NX about a year ago and it translated easily.  I'm not an engineer so the biggest part for me was learning drawing practices, GD&amp;T and manufacturability.  How to most efficiently do stuff in CATIA just comes with time.","1375315604"

One of the reasons it's illegal is the same reason it's illegal to not wear your seat belt.  Everybody thinks you'd just be hurting yourself so why force people to do it?  Because what happens when somebody gets hurt?  They go to the hospital.  Even if they can't pay for it the hospital still has to treat them.  Insurances don't wan to cover people who are unnecessarily putting themselves in harms way either.  Same thing with doing what these guys are doing.  When they get hurt, somebody's going to have to deal with it.

The more important reason, which is even more obvious then the first reason, is they're out on public roads and highways with other motorists traveling at high speeds.  If they fall off in front of somebody that person now has to swerve to avoid hitting them and their bike.  Imagine what would have happened if one of them fell off in front of all those people on the freeway (or whatever major road that was).  A lot more people would have gotten hurt than just them.

**TL;DR:** It's illegal (and should be) because other people can end up suffering from what they're doing too.  If they were the only people who had to deal with the consequences of their actions it would be perfectly legal.","1375315605"

Breathing with your mouth may cause temporary dryness of the oral mucosa (the mouth) and the respiratory epithelium which lines the tract through your larynx and into the lungs (respiratory epithelium also lines the nasal cavity and upper soft palate). And thus may cause temporary discomfort until you wake up and appropriate salivation/fluid lubrication commences.

Yeah, that shit sucks. I'm an E-4, let me do a quick explaining.

Let me explain it really quick
______________

Left is what you make and receive:

* Base pay is before taxes
* BAS is for food and stuff and extra stuff when you get to your ship like uniforms and snacks and crap, it's really just extra money, looks like a lot, it isn't.
* I get BAH because of a special program I was allowed to take advantage of and being single. It's automatically sent to my rent payment though.
* Career sea pay, exactly as it says.

______________
The Middle column are deductions:

* Federal taxes - Yeah, that's a lot.
* FICA (both) - You need these, and they force you into it. You want them because full coverage is VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD.
* SGLI (Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance) - This is what you pay into if you die and your family gets your money.
* State Taxes - Some states you can get this stopped, not recommended to stop it since it's like a HUGE bonus when they new year rolls around to April. It's nice, quite.
* Meal Deduction - Automatic payment for food. You'll use your CAC for meals most of the time, until you get to a ship.
* **TSP - This is big! REALLY BIG AND IMPORTANT! PAY ATTENTION HERE** - This is your investment program, there is a lot of research to this and it's pretty intense, research it. This is a great way to make A LOT OF MONEY.
* Debt - They gave me this... I have no idea why. It's really dumb. That was my last payment.
* Mid-month-pay - This is a deduction for your first pay-check. The entire LES (leave and earnings statement, which is what this is, part of it anyways) comes out on the 25th of every month, unless it's the weekend. This deduction is just to show what's left of the end column.
* MGIB - (NOT PICTURED) This is the program which allows you to go to college for ""free"". Don't go with post 9/11 go with this, if you haven't gone to college that is, if you have do this for the children you have/might have some day. GO MGIB, NOT POST 9/11 IT IS A TERRIBLE OPTION. **And you can always go from MGIB to P9/11 anyways, but you can't go the other way.**

______________
Left Column:

* Tot Ent - Total money given to you for the month.
* Tot Ded - Total taken from you, lovely numbers.
* Tot Alt - This is my BAH, and automatically taken out.
* Net Amt - Total left after all of it
* Cr Fwd - The dollar value of all unpaid pay and allowances due to reflect on the next LES as the +AMT FWD.
* EOM Pay - What you got on your last pay-check of the month.

___________________________


**Some facts fun things to know!**

* When you get (if you get) to basic, the time will come where people from Navy Federal will come to your Compartment (the living space you and your division of 80+/- people will live in) and give you a presentation. **Don't think, sign up with them.** They offer much better every thing, and you will always get paid and paid a day early, even if the 15th falls on the weekend or a Monday, you will get paid Friday prior.

* **E-3 makes about 1714.35 EOM pay is 638.47 and MID-MONTH-PAY is about 609.49, it flip flops and stuff. It's weird.**

... MORE TO COME AT SOME POINT.

Also, feel free to ask me anything else.

Now, imagine he had the balls to talk to her and the looks to get her number. And imagine him having enough game to get in bed with her. That would make him a pedophile, wouldn't it. Only because he's terrible at telling ages. Now imagine if she *actually* did tell him she's 18.

You're talking about some really personal, possibly embarrassing things that are going on that you really wouldn't like getting out. Especially to your parents, just because either you're not comfortable with them knowing or whatever, you've been there you know what it's like.

But now imagine after you get done talking about the really embarrassing stuff, your parent walks up to you and tells that they just listened to the entire conversation. Then they bring up the really embarrassing and private thing that you really didn't want to be brought up. How would you feel? Chances are you'd feel violated, hurt, like you couldn't trust them. That's how we feel.

Now I can see if the kid was into all sorts of drugs and other bad stuff like that, but most of the time they're not. It's just an unprovoked invasion of privacy. And quite frankly, I don't like that.

And don't bring my parents into this. They have done a fine job in raising me. You're questioning 17 years of work because I told you to ""shut the fuck up"" because you were being stupid? Seems legit...","1375315612"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Critical thinking is dangerous to the process of controlling the message but absolutely crucial in being part of an educated electorate, something this country sadly seems to be lacking.

This isn't something new. Religion has been used to keep the population docile and prevent embarrassing questions from causing the powers that from becoming part of the public dialog. After all, how can you question any decision from a man who is said to be the direct descendant of God or the gods, as the case might be.

Today we face a very different challenge, massively financed  and organized, public opinion manipulation firms. These companies have no other purpose than to influence the opinion of those who can be swayed. They have no ethical boundaries and are only motivated by money. They will carefully sculpt and market test every combination of words with which to present a point from and then recommend the best solution to a put a political point (or a product) in it's most favorable light.

As an example, if you were a telephone company who was constantly hearing complaints from your customer about bad service, you could launch an ad campaign where a group of obviously smart people would walk around testing your service by repeatedly asking ""Can you hear me now?"" into their cell phones. After all, this is exactly what you would expect these engineering types to do, right?

[Here's a link](http://www.psrast.org/propaganda.htm) to a reasonably good article which describes the process.

Don't kid yourself, there's a lot of money at stake here and more importantly power - for those who crave both. From what I can see, such people are not hindered by any sense of right and wrong, as long as what they are doing is bringing them closer to their goals.

The question is, how far are they willing to go and what are they willing to do to stop critical thinking from derailing their process. What I do find interesting is that the common wisdom used to be to keep these engineered message away from two-sided discussion as it was likely that their message could be debunked - but the Internet has changed all of that. I suspect that this is causing this industry fits of discomfort and I am proud to be one of the many who are providing them with that service.","1375315613"

In fact, it only seemed to encourage them. Then, I really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. Even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, neck, chest and hair seemed to have no effect.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Fair enough!  I agree that the overall story arch was relatively ""standard,"" but that's okay - plenty of good stories are just variations of classic ones.  What matters more to me, at least, is the way the characters react to things and change over time.  For instance, it felt like a really important moment when Ellie started carrying a gun, and I just eat that shit up.  [Joel's decision at the end made perfect sense for his character, and it's pretty neat that they could make it so understandable, even while being competely morally acceptable.](/spoiler)

I thought their action gameplay was really impressive - it might not have any brand new flashy innovative features, but it's wild how streamlined and elegant they got it to be.  They took the best parts of their existing Uncharted combat model and mixed in some other elements from games like Deus Ex (behavior-and-awareness-based enemy encounters) and Resident Evil 4 (item rationing combined with precision-focused aiming).  I love that the molotovs and health packs are made from the same ingredients, too...that can be a tough decision and it makes the system feel really well thought-out.

the carbon build up is something you see in cars that are rarely taken up to speed/revved high. if you do take it up to speed often, then it may be related to the injector problem.

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","Exactly. Now I'd say it'd be a little extreme for a woman to say you were stalking because you were checking her out.... but.... 

I have an experience with being stalked.... Sort of.

I had this friend that was always miserable. And one day I got tired of listening to him complain and was busy with another friend anyway. So I ignored his texts.... which turned into 100's of texts.... then phone calls... tons of phone calls... followed by tons of voicemails..... All of this in the span of a couple hours since I ignored his text. At this point I'm pissed off and a little concerned about his mental well-being....

(I did, a couple times tell him that I just didn't want to deal with it today.... his messages were all like, ""What did I do? I'm sorry! WHY."" Like really whiney.)

The friend I was with at the time went with me to the corner store by myself to pick up some drinks when I get a text again, but this time it says, ""I see you."" Now, I should note that my friend lives on the other side of the city, so it wasn't a coincidence that he ended up near the corner store by my house. This just didn't feel right. This was behavior that I would never expect from him, so it made me concerned.

I freaked out and hid in the store for a while. When we felt like he was gone, we got in my friend's car to go home. We took some back-alley way because we were legitimately worried...

And he showed up in the parking lot in front of my place.
I started screaming at the top of my lungs, basically telling him that what he was doing wasn't okay, and hoping that anybody nearby would hear in case we needed help.

He started crying and left. I never heard from him again.
It certainly wasn't a repeat offense, and looking back on it from a less-feeling-threatened position, I can understand why he might've thought what he was doing was acceptable.

I've since forgiven him, but he won't make eye contact or respond to me when I speak with him. I imagine he's embarrassed.","1375315616"

well I want to clear this up, because you are misunderstanding my point here which is that even if you don't require the double the amount for a household of two as a household of one, you will still receive double so long as you aren't married.

&gt;How so?

Just meant to say it's a derivative of NIT.

&gt;No such distinctive exists either under EIC or the proposed NIT, its benefit is graduated such that it never disincentives earning more or working.

I won't go into the proposed NIT, because I'm unclear as to which proposal you are referring to. But EITC has the effect of lowering the number of hours worked by taxpayers who are already in the work force, especially by those who fall into the regions where the tax credit is constant or being phased out, due to the negative income and substitution effects.","1375315620"

"haskell","t5_2qh36","&gt; In particular, there is nothing you can do with a monad that you couldn't have already done without the monad— and that includes IO! 

I'm trying to figure out exactly what you mean by this.  You could mean:

1. That in a technical sense, Haskell code using the IO monad isn't actually ""doing"" the I/O, but rather building up values that represent composed I/O actions.  This is true from some perspective, but it's hardly a useful perspective.

2. A set of I/O combinators and primitives could have been provided without actually being an instance of the Monad type class or working with the corresponding syntactic sugar.  This is also true, but really doesn't help a Haskell programmer, unless they care to re-implement their compiler and standard library to obtain a different language.

Neither of these seems to justify that I/O can be done just as well without monads, at least in the existing Haskell language.  Is there some meaning I've missed?","1375315621"

It can also be seen in response to prior revolutionary movements, especially the SI, in abandoning the study of means/ends, form/content while emphasizing the content of struggle especially, although, and I'm not quite sure of this, I believe some still do emphasize form over content but that may be the difference between CT and left communists.","1375315621"

The people that run them are assholes.

There's no need to beat a dead horse. We know all that, and unfortunately, nothing will change.
Doubling wages will not work.

If you double the wages then working at McD's will no longer be an entry level job. Yes, many people in America that work there are not using as an entry level job but that's a different problem. If the wages are higher than more qualified people will come knocking for the job. Then there are even more unemployed, uneducated people in the unemployed workforce. This is why the minimum wage cannot be increased drastically until the middle class unemployment wage is lowered. The situation is not that simple. The higher the wages the more educated and qualified the basic worker needs to be. The problem is not the corporations, it is the institutions. If societal institutions change corporations will be forced to change. The converse is not true. More capital must be invested into education for economic growth. Plus, McDonald's are, for the most part, independently owned and operated and outside of the the immediate influence of corporate Ronald McDonald.  ","1375315622"

Cornell is different from the smaller Ivy's, absolutely, but it is the best school in the Ivy League for most areas of engineering as well as for computer science. It is the best school in the world for Hospitality, Architecture, Viticulture and Veterinary Medicine and everyone associated with these fields knows it. The law and business schools are fantastic and undergraduate education for all of its colleges is highly regarded by employers.

As someone who spent time at Cornell, Yale, and then Stanford, guess what: no one dresses differently at these schools. No one dresses like this album at Yale or Harvard or Princeton.

While I agree that the fashion at Cornell is generally unimpressive (at least among men), it's not unusual for an Ivy League school or for any school in the US.","1375315623"

How can we still let money in, but mitigate its corrosiveness? Things like the Fair Election Act are a good start. I'm not saying we should take out ALL money, but we need to figure out a way that makes wealth's power more proportionate and spread out, rather than heavily pooled at the top.

That being said, I can definitely see why most men don't like it. You really put yourself out there, but it's really all about the context: if you're drunk, the dancefloor is at least semi-crowded and you enjoy the company of the people around you, it's no problem having a good time.","1375315642"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","First of all you gotta make sure the DM is on the ruse so when you have to bless a PC he will add the appropriate bonus but not take it in account, maintaining the charade. Otherwise you won't be able to go very far. I didn't read the new rules but in d20 I'd advise you to get some ranks in knowledge (religion).

It's a good idea to weight the pros and cons or belonging to a pre-existent monastic order or making up your own. A well know church will give you more weight when you trying to impose yourself but you might encounter a few REAL paladins or clerics that might call you on your bullshit. A made-up god/church will give you more room for improvisation and more liberties (""I can't surrender my weapons, my goddess demands that I always have steel close by"" or ""my chastity vow? oh no ma'am you are thinking of the holy illuminated knights of St.Karras, I'm a member of the Divine Enlighted knights of St. Karras, a much more progressive order ""), but people will be less likely to be afraid of curses from a god they never heard of.

On the subject of stealing from your friends, remember that popular thieves and scoundrels in fiction seldom steam from THEIR friends, they might steal from others, embezzle funds, get a larger share that they should, pocket a valuable item or bauble without telling the rest of the party (yes, YOU, Baggins), but they don't really fuck their friends over (and get to stay friends after).

Now that you have set up your cover, here's some suggestions for your ""?"" from the ""1. disguise as paladin 1.? 3.profit!"" plan.

Sell fake fake blessings and potions. Not fake healing (it's harder to really know if a dragon's protection potion is fake until it can be actually tested and by then...), sell indulgences, threaten people with excommunication, real priests in the real world did this all the time and some still do.

You could also be a paladin inquisitor. ""These book/maidens/scrolls/silverware are impure and tainted, I must take them for cleansing/burning at my church lest you want to be burned alongside them. Don't worry I'll write you a note."" Not that true paladin or not that's a quick way to have a very upset mob chase you away from the city.

Getting invited into rich nobles and merchants houses will also be a bonus and give you many opportunities. ""thank you for your kindness mayor/guild master/Sir. taking me in was truly an act of piety, that doesn't go unnoticed by my god. I would rather sleep under the more humble abode of a simple inn but my order forbids owning money except those I receive as a donation and I couldn't beg enough to pay for a place at a stable or a hot bowl of soup. Allow me to repay your kindness with a prayer and a blessing.""

Also it's very very important to figure out how to maintain your charade.

Paladins can heal, you can't. Explain that you belong to a more martial order and your god does not allow healing ""Aren't my god's blessings and will enough to help me defeat my enemies?"".
Paladins can (don't remember this correctly) repel the undead. Wave a holy symbol in front of one, roll a dice and let your GM tell your party that you failed. Failed at too many rolls? Shout at your god in the sky why has he forsaken you. (Maybe even scream that you only broke your celibacy vow halfway). 
Get a paladin-like sword with the adequate holy bonus and enchantments, most of the time a NPC paladin could be replaced with a guy with good combat bonus, holy sword and armor and few players would have a way of telling the difference.
Party members want some sort of blessing, bonus? Try it on them and when it doesn't work say that your god is very strict and perhaps doesn't think of your friend as worthy.

Then the next day she (ex-gf) was asking about the size of my wiener. She had been coming onto me on and off, she would get frisky with me occasionally and talk about how she wants to fuck, but then change her mind as if I took a second too long to act or suddenly had a change of heart because of her baby daddy or something. Then she says something like ""I'm not into you, I never will be, I love my 'husband' (just a baby-daddy who got deported for beating the fuck out of her and being an illegal). I know what you're going to say, I have terrible taste in women and I know it.

So next, the ex-gf texts me and says she wants to see my penis really, really bad of course. So she comes over while on break at work and says 'whip it out'. I have never done anything like this before, so across the apartment I unzip my pants and drop them, I'm terribly shy. My dick is hanging out of my pants -semi hard- because it isn't sure what to do either. She looks at it, and blushes then says ""I thought it would be bigger."" I don't take it personally; my dick is actually pretty large, and anyway she tells me that I should be a porn star so I assume she was just teasing me. I ask if her if she wants get naked too because I wanted to see her ass. She insisted that she can't because 'she's married'. I pull my pants back up and we laid down for a little bit on my bed quietly looking each other in the eye and I ask her if she's feeling horny, she says yes and then I ask her if she plays with herself, ""not really. I have kids, no time for that anymore."" I look at her and glance down at her pants, and ask if she needs 'a hand' but she says no.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","No. The fate of a particle is based on size. Basically, if it is ""large"" it is moved out by cilia, if it is small it is eaten by macrophages, and if it is tiny it is absorbed by some unknown method.

 Particles 100 µm or larger are not typically drawn into the body by inhalation because of their size. Particles in the size of range of 10 to 100 µm are unable to make the turns and impact on the nasal hairs, nasal mucosa, or mucus-covered ciliated epithelium in the bronchi and bronchioles. Soluble particles simply dissolve,while insoluble particles are transported up the conducting airways by the ciliated epithelium and swallowed or expectorated.Smaller particles less than 10 µm in size are generally able to travel into the pulmonary part of the lungs (the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs), where gas exchange, or respiration, occurs. Thus, particles that reach this part of the lungs are called respirable particles and, if deposited, are typically removed by particle-eating cells called macrophages. These macrophages transport the insoluble particles either to the lymph system or to the ciliated epithelium in the bronchioles. The article “Particles in Practice: How Ultrafines Disseminate in the Body” raises questions about how ultrafine particles smaller than 100 nanometers (or 0.1 µm) are able to be absorbed into the body and distributed in the cells. They do not appear to be encapsulated by macrophages and seem to be entering cells and transported throughout the body by other, yet unknown,mechanisms. This has significant implications for the potential health effects caused by particles in this size range

I fell absolutely in love, decided Jews were my favorite thing in the entire world, and moved to Crown Heights a year later. Also joined a massive Hillel, got on the board for their Koach section (which is probably why I have such a Conservative slant), and by then I already felt so Jewish that conversion was really the only thing left to do.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the idea. I'm just trying to broaden the purpose and scope of games.

However to counter your original argument that is not how you win at war thunder. Having four people on one enemy is the worst idea ever. It is NOT how real pilots work, either.

Sure real pilots may have multiple members to a squad, but they have one guy (typically the outermost attack first, when flying in formation)attack one enemy. The second guy is there as back up in case the first didn't get the job done, and to cover the first guy's ass in case someone else comes into play. Rinse and repeat through the formation that each person is covering the one before him in line. You should never have a full squad on one enemy, because that will open up the air for one lucky enemy pilot to get a possible four free kills.

Furthermore having a squad is not what keeps you alive. Playing smart is. If you keep your altitude up you'll have room to maneuver/bleed energy and get it back. You'll also have a better idea of how far everyone is, and you'll be mostly un-challenged. Especially with boom and zoom fighters this is a good idea to stay more reserved, and pick only easy targets, or just fly around waiting. There's nothing wrong with waiting for an opportunity.

If we don't get unlimited fuel or amenities, the really cool ship Spock used in the first new Star Trek movie (jellyfish). It's the ""fastest ship"" and looks cool as hell, plus it has a dark matter drive so no need to refuel. And it seems small enough to park in a driveway, but big enough to live in if need be. Since it's so fast, I'd use it to explore the universe, since anything slower wouldn't work out very well.

If we get the amenities but no fuel, any of the large ships from Star Trek. Holodeck, replicator, and teleporter are a golden combo.

If we get fuel but no amenities, the Bistromatic from hitchiker's guide. Can be unbelievably fast or slow depending on distance, since it works like a pendulum. Plus, really cool way of running it.

I think you're getting Callaway mixed up with Ping. For starters, Callaway (and most other manufacturers) only recently started putting serial numbers on clubs. His X-14 irons won't have any. Secondly, the only way he'd get a replacement X-14 6 iron is if they had one in their used club collection...but that would come at a cost. Callaway discontinues all of their clubs after a certain point, unlike Ping, who will gladly reproduce any club they have ever made (with the exception of the BeCu clubs). That being said, if he wanted to get the irons re-shafted, he may have to send them back to Callaway anyways, depending on how capable his local repair shop is.","1375315666"
"Gaming4Gamers","t5_2x2wj","From my extensive reading into the issues people carried about the XB1, it seemed more centered around the ""you can only use it in very limited regions/no such thing as used games/good luck those of you demographically unable to get good internet""

To me, those points didn't make for an interesting console, but rather one I want nothing to do with. However I do get your point as there were some really cool features about it. I was looking forward to seeing them integrate the Kinect a bit better... who knows how that could have helped an integration with the Occulus Rift?

But yeah, it really didn't help their cause the way Microsoft PR seemed to always say ""if you want a better console, just use your 360!""","1375315666"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Your reason for cheating was the drugs, and your previous outlook on the relationship. Her reason apparently was the shittiness of the relationship at the time. Drugs wear off in a matter of hours. Confusion resulting from the emotional turmoil of whatever this rough patch was, doesn't wear off like that. So I get what you're saying about how much more awful it feels that she planned this out at least a little bit, but I don't see THAT significant of a difference. It seems she too came to the same realization and changed outlook on the relationship.

For me it would really depend on the context of this rough patch, which could be any number of complicated things. I'll take a stab at it though. I'm gonna guess that this rough patch passed when you sobered up and decided you wanted to marry her, and everything's been great since.   Perhaps at this bad time, you were together for 7 years and as far as she knew never going anywhere forward, its a tough place to be in and you have other suitors promising you they wouldn't fritter away your life thinking they're too good for you, or whatever may have been said. Not that thats what happened or excuses cheating, but when you have someone messing with your head and you're stressed out about how committed or dead-end your relationship is, its different from when you have some direction. I don't know, its up to you how you feel about the full picture.","1375315668"

It can do everything.

Pick a langauge: emacs has support for it. In fact, one of the first programs to get support for new languges - like [ruby](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/Matz_Ruby_how_emacs_changed_my_life.html) - is emacs. You can use it as an [IDE](http://ecb.sourceforge.net/screenshots/index.html) or as a simple text editor.

You can make it look as [pretty as you want](https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/a35f101607c4eb69ef635628429a5477b717309e/687474703a2f2f73332d65752d776573742d312e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f6772617068656e652f6772617068656e652e706e67).

Some folks are talking about vim here. The nice thing about emacs is that you can make it use vim's [keybindings and mode of operation](http://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home). I can switch between them depending on what I am doing without much thinking at all.

Seems like your health is more important than your religion but that's another story.

Not to be lost is how great it is that you've lost such a significant amount of weight. 

You might try to vary the protein to fish and chicken and you might have to stop before you're full. 8-( I think it's pretty clear these days that eggs are not the awful bombs that have been promoted in the past. However, since your lab tests show elevated protein you might want to find a substitute - perhaps a couple of non-fat jello or other desert type products.

Maybe something with a bit more carbo. I enjoy Special K High Protein cereal (well in the US) with a non-carb milk product (like almond milk) for a total carb of about 15g. Perhaps a good low net carb bread substitute (tortillas or pitas). Not sure if this fits into your plan.","1375315673"

A full time job is very advantageous and takes away more stings than you might think. Learn the three realities: to cook, to manage money, and to not do drugs (including alcohol and smoking). Any landlord in the world will take you on if your personality is ambitious, positive and reasonable. You don't have to bear with it.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Except McDonald's did not ask you to subsidize anything.  If you raise the minimum wage, they will have to raise their prices.  Not as many people will eat there.  They will lose money.  Because YOU decided they needed to change the way they do business with their money.

If you have a problem with food stamps, then end food stamps.  You don't put a system in place, and then get pissed off when a company works within that system.  If you have a problem with that system, then change it.  

The only reason there is very little ""does"" or ""will"" is because most of the people clamoring for change won't put their money where their mouths are and just shop somewhere else.  Everyone's happy to bitch about Walmart and McDonald's, right after they get done buying cheap toilet paper and Big Macs.  That's the crux of the free market argument, that the impetus is on YOU to spend money where you see fit, not to just demand that everyone else bend to your will so that you can shop there guilt free. 

Here is in western NC.  Yes, we have a minimum wage, but the companies I'm talking about have voluntarily agreed to pay a ""living wage"", and are certified as such.  As a result, they do very well because people want to support a business that they're happy with.  Here's a link:

http://justeconomicswnc.org/living-wage-certified-employers/

It's not really a slippery slope, because the argument for each is the same.  You don't think it's fair that a company can pay less than what you deem acceptable, even if they HAVE to in order to stay afloat, so why would you think it's ok for them to lay people off entirely when it's between that and bankruptcy.

Again, I know you guys think you're sticking it to big bad business, but a lot of much smaller places are going to suffer miserably from such a change.  Places that just can't afford to do that are going to go under.  And a lot of employees who were quite happy working for $7.25 an hour are going to be jobless.  

What if I personally am happy working for $7.25 an hour?  I certainly loved the $5.15 I was getting when I was 16.  I'd sure as hell rather have that than no job.  So if I'm willing to work for $7 an hour, and someone is willing to pay it, who the hell are you to get in the way of that, when you have absolutely no stake in either side of that agreement?","1375315675"

The only F2P thing I could think of that would not be a problem for most people would be special housing items that the player had in a room/s that only they could access.

Having said that, I think taking the opinion that we are 'lucky' because of their decision is taking it too far, it's simply good game design because it's a focus on the game not the money.  In that regard it gives them a market edge and I think that will pay off for them.

Blizzard games are very steadily progressing towards the F2P/money making aspect, and I don't touch there games any more because of it.  I even had a deposit down on D3 and never bought it because of the AH.  There's plenty of reasons why F2P is a good idea for some games and companies, it allows smaller developers to put out excellent games, like Path of Exile for example, and some addictive ones, like Farmville.","1375315676"

Kids who grew up without parents and wanted to belong to a family.  Remember that when you write your first charge sheet.  Don't get sucked into the powerpoint warrior bullshit.  Listen to your SNCOs - they're the ones who will train you in real leadership - but recognize if you get a bad SNCO that you should learn what not to do from.

I assume the same thing. Cryptozoic probably now has exclusive rights to distribute the game in the States, at least.

Given how much attention the game has received, I bet the license is more valuable than one for a typical game by a published designer like Keith Baker.

&gt; Along with that they would then sell future copies of the game with a percentage going to the owners of the property until the debt was repayed.

And I also am an experienced psychedelic user.  To me there are many core features of the psychedelic experience in the meditative experience, the first is no sense of self or ego, a sense of interconnection with the world and an accompanying sense of bliss or a transcendent kind of happiness, the next is the experience of an eternal present and no sense of time.  The feelings of spaciousness and no boundaries are present in both, and you also pay very close attention to everything in your experience like on a psychedelic, there's also that feeling of lightness, floating etc.  the main differences are that on psychedelics you have sensory effects that are not present in meditation, meditation won't give you visuals or enhance your senses.  Also psychedelics can effect your thought process in ways that meditation doesn't, although meditation does tap you into that creative flow that psychedelics are so great for.  Meditation also has an MDMA type element to it, atleast for me, it gives me a great body feeling, but without any of the speedy stimulant aspect of MDMA.","1375315677"

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","The exaggeration of your wording borders on outright dishonesty or just a lack of experience with laptops... I got my M17x R4 in September of 2012 when it was still new. The specs were i7-3610QM, HD 7970M, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Blu-Ray, 1080p screen, etc. It cost $1.4K refurb. Right now these laptops should be cheaper since the new Alienware lineup came out.  Since then I upgraded the laptop with a free 256GB Patriot SSD I got from work. I have three slots for SSDs and/or HDDs. Four slots for RAM, for a max of 32GB (hell, I didn't even need the 8GB RAM, but I didn't have a choice to customise the laptop because I bought it refurb, not CTO). 

If I wanted to, I could have gotten an M18x R2 with CrossfireX dual 7970M and a faster CPU for as low as 1.9-2K - again, refurb. The GTX 680M was more expensive, but notebookcheck.net did note that the 7970M kinda won out in the updated benchmarks following the new 13.x drivers (though SLI still remained superior to CrossfireX). These GPUs can be upgraded too, thanks to very easy MXM 3.0 standardisation of Dell mobile GPUs. 

Obviously if the buyer is uninformed, they may end up paying 3.5K because they were stupid and ordered from the wrong places. But you can do that with desktops too. The best desktops are custom-built, so people who assemble them know a bit more than the average person who buys pre-configured laptops/desktops. However, they're a miniscule minority in the computer world. Lots of people, for instance, make the mistake of maxing out CPU but getting a crappy GPU. For gaming you need the best GPU money can buy but a mid-range i5 or a lower-end i7 is easily more than enough for every game out there, perhaps with the exception of shitty-optimised PS2. 

Now, I have had rigs that I built myself in the past, but I found that the lack of mobility killed them for me, since I always move and always travel. Cheaper for me to have one laptop than a desktop beast-rig and a good laptop. Though quite honestly, I work with computers so I own around 50 or more laptops at any given moment. None come close to the Alienware unfortunately. I wish the Sager/Clevo custombuilts were better, but they really aren't due to their lousy body quality and their high cost compared to used/refurb Alienwares. 

***
EDIT: 

Desktops still win out in terms of raw performance, but I did the calculations when I was looking for a gaming laptop and I figured out that unfortunately I wasn't really saving through buying a desktop. To get an equivalent of an M17x R4 in autumn of 2012 you had to spend (using eBay 2012 prices, mind you, not the more expensive Newegg ones):

* $300 on an HD 7870, 

* $350 on an i5-4670K or an equivalent Sandy Bridge i7, 

* $150-200 for a good mobo, 

* $100 for a PSU, maybe more if you wanted one that won't catch on fire after 4 years as I've seen some do

* $150 for PC3-12800 RAM of the M17x R4

* $100 for HDD, 

* $100 on Windows 7, 

* $150 for a cheap 1080p monitor, 

* $50 for a webcam&amp;mic

* maybe $50 for keyboard and mouse (or more if you want a nice keyboard with neat lighting effects for nighttime like the AW keyboard) 

* $100 for speakers to equal the quality of the Klipsch ones in the M17x R4

* $150 for a sleek case 

* $50 for a sound card to equal the Recon3Di on the M17x/M18x

* $50 for a wifi card to equal Intel Centrino Ultimate on the M17x/M18x

* $50 for a Blu-Ray drive 

...and then you had to ship the components too. I like putting stuff together, but some people don't. Oh, and it's far easier to have a free 1-year warranty on everything than to not have one. Not that I care about warranties personally. After all of this, you would have a pretty heavy setup that you would never be able to easily move. I dunno, it's not for everyone I guess. ","1375315681"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You can see [the view from the 6th floor](http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth49539/m1/1/med_res/) L.H.O. had a clear direct shot.

On top of that, after the first shot the car's speed slowed from 14mph to 8mph, roughly. (As stated in *""Men of Courage: JFK Assassination Evidence, Discoveries &amp; Suspects.""*) So moving target... but only an 8mph moving target in the direction of his line of sight. So it was stacked in his favor.

**WARNING:NSFW/NSFL** [And here is the stabilized Zapruder Film](http://youtu.be/jWHdEeHNbXY?t=17s) where Kennedy gets shot the second time (*seriously, this is a cleaned up and stabilized version of the Zapruder film, so it's much more graphic than what one might be used to seeing on The History Channel like 4 years ago before Pawn Stars was a thing*). At the 9 second timeframe it goes through the neck and hits Governor John Connally in front of him. I do not claim to be anything close to an expert, but to me that front headsplosion looks like the result of an exit wound. Not the entry point, which it would be entry if it were from *the grassy knoll.* Then again... it's a human skull. What might be typical or supposed to happen doesn't mean that's how it's actually going to respond. I see what looks like an exit wound, which makes me have to assume the bullet came from behind. Which is where L.H.O. was located.

Unless there's some evidence that points otherwise, even though L.H.O. getting off a killshot with a ""crappy"" rifle might be difficult the evidence I've seen points to that being the most likely scenario. Now whether or not he's a lone gunman gone crazy, or hired to do that, or what have you... I have no clue haven't done any research into his motives. And the guy being let in with a gun to kill him at trial thing is sketchy, yeah. Or any of the other quirks about the issue, really hasn't interested me too much so I haven't dug into them. But overall the bullet that killed Kennedy could absolutely and most likely did come from The Snipers Nest. That's what the evidence points to so that's where I'd put my money.

**edit**

Just to add some more evidence I've come across to address some of the repeat questions from this.

&gt;""*Why didn't he hide behind the seat after the first shot*"" 

has been asked a bunch. I didn't know the full extent of Kennedy's medical problems, but as others have stated, Kennedy was apparently suffering from chronic back pain and during this event he was wearing a [back brace (as seen here)](http://jfkassassination.net/russ/m_j_russ/brace.jpg). I've read about him taking pain pills, but didn't know just how bad he was suffering from his pain. This back brace seems to have prevented him from crouching down low to hide. 

&gt;""*Back &amp; to the left, back &amp; to the left*""

Again I fall back to hard evidence and science. As stated earlier, the 6th floor window had a clear line of sight on the motorcade. On top of that there was a group who decided to take it into their own hands and kinda [recreate the situation WITH LASERS!](http://youtu.be/R5JDhi4URds?t=6m29s) This shows based on autopsy data of the wounds Kennedy suffered where to place the laser and the plausible angle of trajectory, and it leads back directly to the 6th floor window. This really nails down that yes this was the position that the killer used to target Kennedy. Was it L.H.O.? I don't know, feel free to argue about it. But it is pretty conclusive that there was no grassy knoll gunman, OR if there was it didn't matter because it was the two 6th floor window shots that killed Kennedy and those were the only bullet holes he had in him.

To add to that with regards to my comment about how the Zapruder film shows the damage of an exit wound, thus the back of the head must be the entry wound (where the shot came from). This looks to be corroborated by [evidence of the entry wound at the back of the head.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/JFK_posterior_head_wound.jpg/446px-JFK_posterior_head_wound.jpg) This shows a very clean and distinct entry wound consistent of a bullet. Exit wounds tend to be gnarly. Which is why the damage looks so severe in the Zapruder film, [it really was like a head explosion with pieces of skull completely breaking off](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/JFK_skull_trajectory.jpg/457px-JFK_skull_trajectory.jpg). Only they stayed near because of being attached to the skin, so they flapped over instead of flying away. I was going to link to an image of the actual autopsy showing how bad the fragmentation was and the size of the hole... but yeah it's pretty damn graphic. If you really really need to see it, just google image JFK Autopsy. But you don't need to, it's fucked up.

So yeah, Kennedy autopsy shows 2 bullet holes in him. Both from a rear trajectory specifically. And he indeed wore a back brace which sadly prevented him from crouching down to hide after the first shot.

&gt;""*But 3 shots in 6 seconds? That's not possible, and nobody has been able to replicate that...*""

Firstly, the exact timeframe of the shots is disputable. The Warren commission states it's possibly as little as 5 seconds from 1st to 3rd shot, and analysis of digitally enhanced Zapruder film footage suggests it can be up to as much as 8 seconds total. 

There has been [Ballistics Research done to test how fast and accurate a marksman with a Carcano rifle can be.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_rifle#Ballistics_Research_Laboratory_tests) Both U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory and CBS News did independent testing with numerous participants. Just about all of them could hit a target down range 2 out of 3 times in under 6 seconds. So this just solidifies even more plausibility to whoever was the gunman at the 6th floor window to being physically capable the shooter.","1375315683"

With the long-distance aspect of the relationship, there's a layer of abstraction over the jealousy/insecurity/possessiveness issues that makes it all easier to deal with for now. Maybe that'll carry over to later when it's actually right there in my face, but I honestly don't know yet. I do know how I *want* to feel about it, and if suffering for a day or two and then writing an essay is a repeatable coping/learning strategy, then I have a lot less to be afraid of.","1375315686"

&gt; Luke Davenport is the 13 year old son of Paul Davenport, the President of the United States, and first lady Linda Davenport. Ill tempered Agent Woods is the secret service agent in charge of Luke. Woods is fired after mistreating Luke in front of media cameras. Woods is then replaced by former boxer Sam Simms, who won a boxing title in 1977. Sam is eager to take the job-even though no one else wants it. Everyone thinks that Luke is just a brat when the only thing Luke wants is to just fit in and be like every other kid at his school, the Georgetown Academy. Sam almost gets fired when Luke gets decked at school by school bully Rob MacArthur. This is when Sam decides to use his boxing expertise to teach Luke how to fight. Luke has his eyes on classmate Katie Warren, but so does Rob. Katie agrees to go with Luke to an upcoming school dance, so Sam teaches Luke how to dance. Rob is also at the dance, but this time when Rob tries to deck Luke, Luke turns the tables and decks Rob. Sam is then fired for taking Luke to the dance without permission, although Luke had the permission of his parents, but secret service chief Morton didn't want Luke leaving the White House grounds while Luke's parents were on the campaign trail. Luke runs away anyway to meet a friend that he has been chatting on the internet with. The meeting is set to take place at a local mall,where Luke discovers that his secret friend is a now psychotic Woods, who blames Luke for his firing and wants revenge on Luke, but not if Sam can help it.

Of course, I nearly got killed in a head on collision from a car that needed to turn between blocks going the opposite direction. So, in the future I may go back to left lane riding.  It seems like the safest option, which for cyclists is often the most important factor -- what has the lowest chance of getting you killed.","1375315687"

They sell in bulk, require membership, and essentially have a business model that simply cannot be used to target less wealthy people. Trader Joes is the same way, except they sell their relatively expensive brand of foods exclusively. On top of that, there is no economic model that would suggest the market could support more than a few Costco-styled retailers.

So yeah, you might save $400 on a trip to Walmart, but most of the people who shop there do so because they can't afford to buy at Costco whatsoever.","1375315687"

The Big Bang was the start of time and space, was it not? If not you are just asserting that time and space started before it with no evidence.

No matter how good Killzone is, Battlefield 4 and COD Ghosts are monsters compared to it. This is why I think it doesn't have the wow factor it deserve.

All in all. I am not attacking you or the console you are going to buy. I'm trying to have a fair judgement. I have a pre-order on both consoles at the moment but I will probably cancel one when I have more informations (release date etc...) and buy the other next spring.","1375315694"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt;That's why I included the extra context.

As much as you love using that word, context doesn't work the way you think it does.  Context doesn't change what 'is,' it gives insight to why it 'is.'  Context doesn't change that Flacco is statistically average, it gives insight as to why he has been statistically average.  Context doesn't change the fact that the Cowboys blew their season in week 17 the last 2 years, it gives insight as to why they blew it.

&gt;Would you expect Flacco to put up Brady numbers, or Brees numbers, or Peyton Manning numbers(in Cam Cameron's offense)? 

I wouldn't expect Flacco to put up their numbers if he were inserted into their respective offenses, much less in Cameron's. He would come the closest replacing Brees in NO with Payton at the helm but still isn't as accurate a passer.

&gt;Did I say that he was better than them? 

You haven't said otherwise and while I don't think you're that blind it wouldn't be much of a surprise if you did tell me you thought he was.  So let's get definitive, what QBs are better than Flacco out there?  I'm curious how high he sits for you and it will probably provide me with more wholes to poke in your arguments.

&gt;The 3 rookies did play well, but it's hard to tell after one season.

You mean like it's hard to tell which Flacco we will get after 5 games of ""unsustainably efficent"" play? You mean like How I've said more than once that one year of play isn't enough to judge a QB and 5 games isn't even close to enough? But I thought QBs ""improve.""

&gt;I said that his rookie year has little weight when it comes to projecting his future performance. 

More DISinformation! Call the DISinformation police! Quick! You said ""games from his rookie season have almost no weight."" Not a huge difference, but a difference nonetheless, and according to you before there's no room for error in these things.

&gt;The more recent games are given more weight because he's a developing QB. This is obvious.

Never argued that, just that you give entirely too much weight to 5 games which you yourself call ""unsustainably efficient.""  

&gt;You wouldn't give much weight to Tom Brady's statistics from his first couple of years if you were going to project his performance next season.

Tom Brady is going into his 14th season and has proved for the last decade that he is elite. He has a sample size considerably bigger than Flacco's last 5 games. What I would do with Brady is look at his last 5 years to project his future though.

&gt;I'm still not even quite sure what you're talking about, but it certainly wasn't disinformation. Use words correctly.

You made an inaccurate statement. When I did that you insisted I was willfully spreading DISinformation. Just following your lead.

&gt;Oh, the guy who performed decently enough for one season on a team with one of the greatest defenses of all time? Yeah, that's totally the same thing as a sustained winning performance.

But we're talking about what age Super Bowls were won at, right? Or does that only count when comparing Flacco to Romo.

&gt;Wow, quite a definitive statement. You must be an expert. Wahhh, you're picking and choosing what to ignore. Wahhh, ""your opinion is always right and everyone who disagrees is wrong so it's perfectly ok for you to do this yeah?""

Please, explain to me the relevance of age in this situation then. Flacco won a Super Bowl at a younger age than Peyton and Brees too, does that make him more successful than them? Ben had 2 by 26, what do we take away from that? Elway was 37 before winning his first, what's that mean? I just don't see how age is relevant to how good a player is but I'm willing to listen to you explain it.

&gt;he also has regular season wins, and INT %, and solid statistics in most other categories (yardage, YPA, win probability).""

Yardage and YPA is only solid if you think being average in both is solid. As for WPA, no I actually didn't know what you were talking about. I don't use Advanced NFL Stats much and have never put a lot of stock into that stat.  But if you want to use it let's go down that road. First off, it's important to note that this is a cumulative stat, not a percentage or averaged out number.  It measures the Win Probability Added by a QB looking at each individual play and it's impact on the game.  Am I wrong in equating this with your previously mentioned ""maximizing win probability,"" which ""is all that matters for a QB on a given team,"" put into statistical form?  So the fact that Romo ranks above Flacco in this stat means he's better then right? In 2012 at least, and that's including playoffs, giving Flacco an extra 4 games to catch up in a cumulative statistic.  In fact, 2010 is the only season Flacco ranked ahead of Romo.  Romo played in 6 games and the Cowboys as a whole were terrible.  That's the year Wade was fired midseason.  In the last 5 years Flacco has played 93 games and accumulated an 11.24 WPA. We're back to the only argument you have for Flacco over Romo being wins and INTs. 

Can I also point out that in 2008 Flacco was in the negatives for WPA in both the regular and post season. While he hasn't been in the negatives in the regular season since then he also hadn't posted a positive number in the post season before 2012.  Your stat is kinda supporting my previously stated opinion that Flacco isn't really the reason the Ravens had been winning in the post season his first 4 years.  Still want to stand by this stat?

&gt; And ranking career statistics among all active QBs is a horrible way to project future performance.

You're the only one trying to project future performance.  I'm analyzing actual performance.  I've made this clear multiple times and you keep assuming my statement of how a player has done means I think he will never do better.  Assume what players will do all you want, but they are who they are until they prove differently in my eyes and Flacco hasn't proved anything yet.  Just shown potential.

&gt;Lol, ooooook. Now who's ""overusing context"" and ignoring what they don't like?

I'm judging all 3 QBs on the same criteria looking at the same 'context' for each.  You change yours to fit your opinion.  Just like with judging QBs, consistency is key.  And just like Flacco, you have none.

&gt;And you ranked Flacco 15th and off of your top 100 players list, not top 10. 

Again, I never definitively ranked him. I did say 15 was an arguable rank but also called it ""harsh."" I also said 9th was an arguable rank for him but you apparently missed that part of the sentence. Realistically I'd put him around 10, maybe 11 I think.  In no specific order I have, Brady, Brees, Rodgers, Peyton, Romo, Ryan, Eli, Roethlisberger(quickly falling due to injuries), Newton(his running gives him the nod over Flacco's slightly better passing).  Those 9 are the tier one and tier two guys to me.  Flacco is in 3 with Stafford, Cutler, and Schaub, and I'll even say his post season puts him at the top of that tier right now.  Then there's the 3 rookies and Kaep who fall somewhere in that fall into one of those three tiers but don't have enough games played to be 'officially ranked' on the level of those other guys.  So that puts Flacco at a solid 10, 9th if you want to take Cam's running out of it.  Like I've said before, no matter what I say about Flacco all you read is how much I think he sucks.  I could call him the best QB to ever play the game and you would find a way to take offense to the statement.

I definitely left him off my top 100 list. After Ryan none of the QBs I listed above made it.  I tried to not go QB heavy as I assumed many others would, and apparently did, in favor of ranking some non-skill position players higher.  If you don't like it, volunteer for the list yourself next year.

&gt;Jesus, stick to your statements you pathetic cop-out artist. If Flacco keeps improving and winning I just know that you're going to weasel out of owning up to anything.

What statements have I exactly gone back on?  You've misquoted me a couple times and I've corrected you, but I've never gone back on anything that I'm aware of.

&gt;If Flacco keeps improving and winning I just know that you're going to weasel out of owning up to anything.

My opinion of both Eli and Big Ben have changed for the better over the last 3 years and those are two teams and players that I actually dislike.  If/when Flacco improves I'll be happy to acknowledge it.  But wins aren't going to be what changes my opinion.

&gt;I said that Peyton won the Super Bowl in his 9th season, I'll add that he didn't win a playoff game until his 6th season, and his 4th playoff run. Romo hasn't made the playoffs for three seasons now...if he was making the playoffs and losing every year, while performing at an MVP level, then the comparison might make sense. Again, not saying that Romo is bad. He's made the playoffs in 3/7 seasons, and won a playoff game.

Exactly, Peyton is a much better QB and took that long to win a playoff game and then the Super Bowl.  Doesn't mean Romo won't win one, just shows that lack of playoff success isn't directly related to skill level.  It's got a lot more to do with the team around the QB than the QB.  The Cowboys as a team have plenty of problems, many of which show themselves when it matters most.  Romo isn't clean of responsibility for those problems but he is about as low on the list as anyone.  We wouldn't have been a 3 win team last year without him.

&gt;There you go, leaving out facts again. The Cowboys finished 8-8 in both of the last two seasons, is that supposed to help your argument?

What difference does it make what the exact record is?  The only important 'fact' here is that they were playing in a win and in situation in week 17 of the last 2 seasons and lost both. 

&gt;And sorry, but Brees is better than Romo without question.

I agree.  Which is why I've said Brees is elite and solidly the number 4 QB in the league.  Swap the two out and Romo is the elite one though.  That's just my opinion.","1375315694"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I'm not even being disingenuous here, but ""atheist Jew"" sounds like an oxymoron to me. You claim to not be fully on board with this circumcision business, yet you would still do it to your son for no better reason than it's been done for thousands of years? At the risk of getting off topic, marijuana has been around for thousands of years, yet possessing it in most countries will get you locked up, yet it's okay to slice up a kid's dick simply because of of an antiquated ""tradition? In and of themselves, which is worse? As for your mother's potential reaction to a grandson with an intact penis, what could she really do about it? What's it got to do with her? What's more important, your mother's opinion on something that, ultimately, is none of her business or your son's opinion about his own body? My own grandmother hasn't seen my penis since I was about 6, and I'm 30 now.

A few months ago I watched some documentary where this Jewish couple decided they couldn't, in good conscience, harm to their son. The wife's parents were interviewed and they said things like they felt  physically sick and they couldn't sleep. The wife's aunt said that any Jews who don't have their son cut have psychological issues. Granted, I'm not Jewish, but this seemed like bizarro-logic to me. The people who *don't* want to alter their son's penis from it's natural state are crazy?! A grandson with a foreskin was the cause of insomnia?! I do my best to be tactful when dealing with matters like this, but you must understand, from an outsider's perspective, this sounds insane. Men who resent being circumcised are often sneered at and told to get a life, but you tell me, who is more in need of a life, a person who is pissed off about something that was done to their body without their consent, or a person who is anguished that this something wasn't done to *someone else's* body?","1375315694"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I found it to be more of a commentary on how children don't really have a need to identify people by their skin color. To a child around the age of 5, who still can barely say their ABC's and add 7+13 this kind of states the lack of a need to identify race. When we grow older, we start seeing differences between people that we wouldn't have noticed as we were children. The notion of racism is that it is mostly taught. Yes, people can have bad experiences with any one of any race that would make them fearful after those encounters, but generally speaking that isn't where racism stems from. 

I mean take a look at what some one commented earlier. 

&gt;[Conejator](http://www.reddit.com/user/Conejator)

&gt;What did you expect? ""The one with the watermelon and fried chicken eating, twerking crack whore nigger bitch who stole the green dress""?

A child would never be able to make such a statement. That entire sentence is full of racism that was created by racist people. These stereotypes don't exist outside of racism, and for good reason. They can't exist unless people make negative comments in an attempt at belittling an entire race. A child wouldn't be able to just make these racist statements, they'd have to hear it from some one else. 

The fact that she said ""the one in the green dress"" is a reminder to everyone that realistically they're both two different princesses and that their race doesn't change that. I mean, they're both people. Adults are the ones that use terms like ""the black girl"" because we've grown up to see people based on their skin color. Young children haven't had that kind of information pressed onto them yet, which is reflected by the statement, ""The one is the green dress."" 

I mean look at this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/FbyGYQY.jpg). It is of a child in a KKK outfit acting curious about the riot shield held by a black cop. The kid is too young at that point to be able to make a distinction between race. Prejudice is learned, not instinctual. 

I grew up in a lower-middle class suburb of Columbus. When I was about 6 my next door neighbor moved because the neighborhood was getting ""too dark."" The family that moved in next door was black, and I became friends with them and would play with their kids. I went to my mom's house last year to pick up a moving truck with a couple of white friends that kept calling the neighborhood I grew up in a ghetto because they saw black people walking the side walks. Most of those black families were more well off than mine, yet it was a ghetto because the majority of the people they saw were black and the houses were old. Not run down, just old. As old as the houses they grew up in, in the more white suburbs. Racism has many faces, and it gets its start by identifying people as being white or black, and not as people. Once your child understands the difference between races, it is important to teach them that all races are equal, and the judgments you place on people should be based on their character and not on their skin color.

I personally find this post to be a ""Look at me, I'm a good parent, my kid isn't racist"" kind of thing. I'm still able to understand how viewing different races doesn't really need to have a place unless you're talking about social differences. I personally don't see people as white or black, unless I'm asked to describe what a person physically looks like. I don't think this makes me better than any one else, I just don't have a need to identify people as being the black one or the white one or the asian one. ","1375315698"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; That's absurd. Ofcourse there is objective truth in what the constitution means.

No, people are free to believe whether or not something is constitutional based on their method of interpretation. Whether or not it is constitutional depends on which method of interpretation you follow. As such, it is subjective.  

&gt; Some things written in the constitution are somewhat vague [unfortunately], that doesn't mean we can pretend anything in it means whatever we want it to mean.

Well, we can do so. It happens quite commonly, even in SCOTUS opinions. However, I agree that we ought not do that. 

But, it does not follow that Original Intent means ""we can pretend anything in it means whatever we want it to mean.""

&gt; Original Intent stuff does seem like judicial activism, yes. It allows people to use their own opinions, and project those opinions on the people who wrote the constitution, opening the door for the constitution to mean anything.

By using original literalism, you are using your own opinions as well. Namely that the text should be read literally. Doing so, thus, is just as ""activist"". 

&gt; So now money is or isn't speech based on our perceived intention of the writers of the law? Okay, we'll go down this road.

No. Are you reading what I am writing? What is the point of discussing something, if you don't listen to what the other person says? The first thing I wrote to you was, ""Of course, money is not speech.""

It is a question of if we should treat money *as though* it were speech, for purposes of the First Amendment. I cited a principle by which to make such a distinction. 

&gt; Are we now saying that regulating the ability for people to give money to politicians could abridges their freedom of speech?

Yes. That is what SCOTUS said in Citizens United. And despite the court was split on the decision, everyone agreed with that fact. Those who supported the government, simply argued that the abridgment was justified. They did not argue against based on a literal meaning interpretation. 

&gt; If yes, doesn't that mean people without much money don't have free speech rights [or at a minimum, have significantly LESS free speech]?

In the same manner that people without houses lack Amendment III protections. And people with less stuff have less Amendment IV rights. 

In an event, the Bill of Rights and specifically Amendment I are enumerations of negative rights. [A negative right is a right not to be subjected to an action of another person or group—](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights)a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or coercion. A positive right is a right to be subjected to an action of another person or group. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder.","1375315699"

I have never understood the decision to force people into sitting at the computer watching the screen when looking for a game, if something, that's what makes people complain about the long queue times even more.

"Tucson","t5_2qmno","Here's a couple of perhaps lesser known trail etiquette tips judging from what I've seen out there:

* Hikers going uphill have the right of way.  They can certainly take a break from their climb to wave those coming down on, but the way is theirs to give.
* Slower hikers have the right of way, meaning it's on the speedster to find a safe place to pass (on the left), but it's polite to stand aside and let faster hikers pass when you know they're behind you. The same applies to groups.
* Say ""Hello!"" A simple greeting helps to make the experience all the better, where as a sourpuss on the trail can sometimes be a real downer.
* Keep your dogs on a leash. It doesn't matter how good they are with people, hikers may not be comfortable with them. Plus, it's usually not allowed by the forest/park anyway to have them off leash.
* Do your ""business"" at least 200 ft. off the trail. Nobody wants to analyze that scat.
* Leave the stereo at home. Personal audio is one thing, but the wilderness doesn't need a pop/rock soundtrack.
* If you go off trail and mark your path with ribbon, cloth, etc. take it with you on your way back. It can be confusing to people looking for a trail.
* Take only photos, leave only footprints. A common saying, and it needs no explanation.

Anyways, those are some of the more common faux paus I've seen.

"Beatmatch","t5_2syix","It's obvious you don't work for a company that makes things.

Behringer makes a lot of products.  We have something like 500 different products in our catalog, and that's not including Midas, KT, Turbosound, etc.  When a company makes that many products, priority has to be placed on those projects - because you can't work on everything at the same time.  In the case of CMD specifically, the project was delayed so priority could be placed on our X32 products.  Now I know that sucks if you're interested in CMD and not the X32, but that's how it works out sometimes.  As the Product Manager for the CMD controllers, no one was more disappointed then I was.  To set things straight, the delay was more like 9 months - not a year.  But it wasn't because of problems in development.  MIDI controllers are simple things, and Behringer knows quite a bit about how to make them.  Our controllers have been used by performers ranging from Richie Hawtin and Tim Exile to Daft Punk.

Your other point is price versus build quality.  The biggest reason we can put out something like the Studio 4a at $200 when everyone else would charge $300 or more is because we own our factory, and we buy the components used in the manufacture of our products in quantities great enough to get substantial discounts.  For example, the CMD controllers use a Texas Instruments TUSB3200 IC.  If a normal guy went to eBay and bought one of those chips, it wold cost them new around $10.  If a medium sized factory made 2-3 products based on the TUSB3200 and bought 20K of them a year, they might get the price down to around $5 a chip.  We have 20 or more products based on the TUSB3200 and might buy 200K of them or more at a time, and get the price down to $1.50 a chip.  That adds up quickly.  Also, just the fact that we own our factory means we don't get charged overhead on production and materials (adding up to at least 20%).  Companies that use contract manufacturing get hit with that overhead (that's where the factory makes their profit).

I hope this helps clear some things up.  If you have any questions about the CMD controllers, I'll be glad to answer them.

Shepherd would have two Krogans, which are a species that threatened a galaxy that was more advanced then them, the only way to take them down was to create a bioweapon specifically catered to stop them. Grunt and Wrex are no slouches themselves when it comes to being warriors, the claymores they use would more than likely kill a spartan in one shot. On top of this Krogans are roughly 7 feet tall and weigh a ton in armor so they're basically Spartans but the Krogans have redundant organs making them even hard to kill, Krogans can also go into a blood rage where they don't feel pain.

Very powerful biotics, Liara, Samara, Jack etc. the Spartans could do jack shit to stop the biotics, warp tear apart things at a cellular level. Stasis would stop the Spartans in their tracks. Kaiden killed his trainer with a single biotically fueled kick, Jack punched through heavily armored robots using her fists and biotics.

Legion can use snipers that have enough recoil to break a humans shoulder, this would rip right through the Spartans shields and armor. We don't even know if most of the Spartans weapons could get through their shields.

Tali once again could basically shut down the electronics in their suits, once that's done those suits are basically half a ton of sitting duck waiting to be taken down by weapons that can fire faster than the spartans can hope to react.

On top of all of this Sheperd is a brilliant soldier, tactician and depending on the class sniper, biotic, tech what have you.","1375315713"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","So you are married to a short girl who works out all the time.  She's ""normal"" weight according to the BMI standards but ""fat"" in your eyes.  And it sounds like she's always been this way (though perhaps getting more exercise now)?  

As an actual fat short girl, I can tell you that it would honest to god take me at least 4 hours a day of exercise (I already eat healthy) to get to a 100 lb weight, which is low normal.  It took me 2 hours every day to get to where your wife is currently.  Since it sounds like ""supermodel"" isn't her full time job and *this is how she was when you married her*, I'm going to echo the sentiments of others here that suggest the problem here is you.

If you cannot see yourself ever finding the attraction to her again, I strongly recommend leaving.  This isn't fair to her.  She's busting her ass and doing the best she can and you can't get it up for her, knowing that.  If you want to work on it, perhaps you two should go to couples counseling and work through this.  

I assure you telling your rockstar, accomplished wife that you think she is overweight when all health indicators say she isn't' is a huge recipe for disaster.","1375315721"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;The big bang? Not even science is sold on the big bang. It could have been a quantum zero point field, a big chill, a big bulk, time might not actually exist and so there might not actually be a beginning. Let's not conflate science with dogma.

Those words you said don't actually mean anything, not to be rude but you don't know what you're talking about. 

The Big Bang describes the period of inflation and the expansion of space. It's backed up by radiation from the CMB, the observation of the continuing (and accelerating) expansion of space as seen in the redshifting of light, specifically of Type 1a supernovae, and also the presence of heavy elements. It isn't a theory describing origins, it describes the process of inflation, conflating the two causes some confusion. 

The confusion about time and beginnings ultimately stems from the notion that time and space are linked. Questions which ask what was 'before' the inflationary period are ultimately meaningless, as we have no (current) way of knowing if there even was a 'before', we know that time as we perceive it 'began' at the Big Bang. To my knowledge, there has not been any exodus, as you put it, from the BB model, to say that science isn't sold on it is quite disingenuous, it's by far the prevailing theory. ","1375315722"

The whole match came down to that quadra in river anyway, hard to judge the comps quality. You'd be hard pressed to find a comp that can come back from a huge mistake like that, baring some season 2 clg.eu miracle happening again.

It was scary, part of the whole BDSM thing is exploration.  That is why trust is so important.  

I really think you should chalk this one up in the ""win"" category.

You learned something about yourself and your partner was there help you.  You make it sound as if he was really supportive, and for that you should be really grateful, that he understood what you needed and gave it to you.  (Stopping and the after care).

Now you know about yourself that you didn't know before, that there is something that can really scare you, and you know what that fear feels like.  And you got all that without being hurt.

It seems like your partner is pretty darn trust worthy an maybe you can ask him to help you explore this aspect of yourself even further if you want.

&gt; King Louis XI is a wise and old king and Frollo is the Chief Justice. Frollo gazes on the gypsy girl, Esmeralda, in the church during Fool's Day and sends Quasimoto to catch her. Quasimoto, with the girl, is captured by Phoebus, Captain of the Guards, who frees the girl. The courts sentence Quasimoto to be flogged, and the only one who will give him water while he is tied in the square is Esmeralda. Later, at a party of nobles, Esmeralda again meets both Frollo, who is bewitched by her, and Phoebus. When Phoebus is stabbed to death, Esmeralda is accused of the murder, convicted by the court and sentenced to hang. Clopin, King of the Beggars, Gringoire the Husband of Esmeralda, and Quasimoto, the bellringer, all try different ways to save her from the gallows.

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","&gt;How do you guys justify spending so much on a wallet? I mean, I'm frugal and all that and keep telling myself that I should quit buying cheap Chinese junk over and over again and buy something nice once 

You basically answered your own question. :) BIFL goes under the philosophy that - it’s better to *buy* *once* for the price of two or three than *buy* *two* *or* *three*. An item that’s considered BIFL will last longer than the cheaper/more common counterpart but quality, craftsmanship, and materials generally comes with a higher price (with some exceptions to the rule). The higher price is usually justified by how long the item lasts or how well it does it’s job, plus bonus points for looking good. ""You get what you pay for"" is not an unfamiliar phrase around here. 

Some things just get better with age and this definitely applies to wallets and leather goods in general. As an example, check out these Saddleback wallets [here]( http://imgur.com/a/LzfDf), [here]( http://i.imgur.com/1fVrR.jpg) and [here]( http://imgur.com/a/Vs9Yq). The first two pics are 6 months old. The last one is 1 year. They look great, don’t they? FWIW, the Bellroy wallets don't look as raw as the Saddlebacks when new. No breaking in required. 

I’ve only had my Bellroy for 7 months but it hasn’t worn in any negative way whatsoever. I trust this will last far longer than any of my older wallets. For life? I am in the process of verifying that but I’d be satisfied if my Bellroy lasted 10 years. It may even exceed that. I’d look towards Saddleback’s products if you wanted something that could survive generation or two.

Anyways, I've been thinking about reddit on and off for some time and about how it feels like it's becoming more and more inaccessible to a casual user even when it is becoming more and more accessible to a casual user.  I don't have any proof, it's just a feeling I get sometimes.  

Some guy spends way more time than he should have making some thing, and he's all like 'let me share it on this site' and nothing happens.  No commentary.  No feedback.  No positive or even negative reinforcement.  But goddamn if he doesn't spend 30 seconds putting together some stupid, shitty image macro and all of a sudden he's the talk of the town.

The Mario and Luigi games are quite fun, the Shin Megami Tensei games are great, Pokemon is pokemon, Radiant Historia is awesome, Fire Emblem Awakenings was a great game.  The 3DS is going to be the system that sees new releases and there are some fun ones in the very near future, however if you are just getting it for a plane ride you can find an old ds for quite cheap.  If you do that the megaman games are great, as is Dragon Quest IX or Devil Survivor.

What makes you think the rules in healthy power exchange relationships are arbitrary? If they are, you're doing it wrong. Do you also think the subbie never has any say in what the rules are? Heard of ""safe, sane and *consensual*""? 

If you really do study psychology you can't have studied very long since you're concerned with dysfunction as opposed to function, and you're certainly no expert on DD and power exchange from the looks of it. Besides, afaik very little research has been done on the topic of power exchange relationships, so you can't have read that many studies on it IF you indeed study psychology. Besides, case studies tend to focus on dysfunction. If you do study psychology, you should be able to deduce what kind of effect that is likely to have. 

I think you've read that piece of crap Fifty Shades of Grey too many times. That shit is not only fiction, poor fiction at that; it is bad BDSM.

OOC: You guys will arrive there at the beginning of [Week 5 Beginning] if no troubles meet your way.

*As the Morpheus Pirates begin to set a course due south towards Yukiryu, they find that the winds are favorful and that they would be due to arrive in a couple days.*

*About halfway through sailing their first day (5 spaces south of Chippenford), they notice that another ship was sailing due east of them, about 5 miles (5 spaces). The ship seemed to be moving Southwest.*","1375315737"
"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I had your same problem but nearly as many titles, I did what you did with about 50 or so games with another 50 still not played. I split my steam library into 3 sections, Installed/regular play games for those I always go back to, beaten games that I don't intend to go back to and installed/backlog games that I need to try and play for at least 30 min to see if I'm genuinely interested and those games get moved to the beaten folder if im not that into them. I've also pretty much stopped buying games with the exception of maybe 1 game a quarter that i was looking forward to and is now discounted.

 The days of buying day 1, full price is over for me. Ive cut out consoles almost entirely from my rotation since its usually an even bigger overall investment per game that I'm just not confident about giving me the desired entertainment value that I *now* seek. Maybe I've grown out of gaming over the 22 or so years I've been playing but I do know I still enjoy it, I've just needed to gear back the amount I'm spending on this hobby and getting more out of what I do end up buying.","1375315737"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Virgin won't tell you (for example) what TV package you've got unless you've passed their DPA process, so it's probably for queries like that. It may also be to cover them if they ring you back.

I'd be surprised if it was sent plain text, as back in 2008 they were fined for losing an unecrypted CD that had customer details on it. They wouldn't be the first company to fail to apply lessons learned from that kind of incident everywhere it was appropriate.

As far as passwords and the like go, the system isn't perfect, but they are making changes. The robot phone machine asks for certain characters from your account password now, so I don't think dots would fly now. It wouldn't surprise me if folk are being asked for the whole password later on either because the agent was making sure or wasn't paying attention or the system wasn't working properly that day. 

As for telephone password stuff, the most egregious example I can think of is one used by a telephone banking system - the security question is ""how many letters long is your mother's maiden name?"". Smith, Jones, Davis, Lewis, Scott, McKay, Patel, Singh, Mason, Brown, Sharp, Evans, White, Baker...

One problem is that most ISPs systems amount to ""wish it was two factor"" authentication. In the past I've been ""DPA verified"" by companies by quoting my own address or my date of birth, two bits of information pretty easily secured if my wallet gets lifted with my driving license in it. Passwords are basically fucked anyway - as Randall Munroe observed we've created a system where passwords are easy for machines to guess and hard for people to remember. In an ideal world everbody would get a SecurID token or equivalent, but that'd cost money and I doubt the shareholders would be paying.","1375315738"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","&gt; A woman will not be physically attacked for these things. 

The reason women aren't physically attacked as much is most likely because of the moral qualms most homophobic alphas have with hitting women. That, and the fact that physical confrontation is usually initiated by men to men.

&gt; Which is why 60% of homosexuality-related hatecrimes in the US are exclusively anti-male, and only 11% exclusively anti-female.

Again with the physical violence in relations to gender thing. There are a lot of social and emotional consequences that you seem to be ignoring. In my experience, gay men are a lot more socially accepted than ""dykes"" are. A flamboyant gay will probably have it easier, socially, than a manly woman.","1375315739"

I was actually the forth person and I did get moved to a double after the first semester when asking the RA about what the movement process is like. If you want to get out, don't be afraid to talk to someone about it...if you don't they're likely to move someone else out first. The living conditions were manageable, I think any dorm will seem impossibly small at first but you'll get used to it quickly. Don't be afraid to move furniture around to your and the roommates' pleasure; I think the first night we were up until 2 am doing this (the original layout was abysmal). At one point we even went as far as making an unofficial triple bunk. I'm not sure how they handle lounges, I was in a triple so the other three people stayed after I left. Presumably they would want to move all four people in your room and I don't know if they would move you all at once or one at a time. The plus side is that they will likely want to get the lounges empty before the other rooms. The rest of your experience will depend a lot on your roommates and how well you get along with them but I didn't have any issues; I didn't get a ton of sleep but that's uni.

There are masters meets in swimming pools if you are at least 18 years old. They are all abilities and ages so you will be seeded with people the same speed as you (even if they are 70 or 80). They have short races like 50s and 100s but you should focus on 400 free, 800 free, and work up to a 1500m or 1650y race. Just note the long events (800s and 1500s) aren't offered at every meet. It is rare for anyone to not finish these events so you should at least be able to swim these distances in practice.

If there is a masters or triathlon club you can join it would help you a lot. Swimming is so technique driven and not intuitive a good coach will make you a much better swimmer and faster.

Since you speak the language of the Imperials, I assume you are part of The Consuming, since it is one of the few sects which uses that language of rituals.

"Starmade","t5_2tnkl","while cubes in a cubic voxel world sure seem to be the right thing **this is far from efficient** and its actually **a DUMB power core** design, no matter how popular it is, its still pretty DUMB!

Instead of building cubes along 3 borders you must simply **stack diagonal lines that are all parallel diagonals of a cube**! you just make power cores like the red line: http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.04/brett1.2.gif  Stack them in parallel IF you want it shorter and ""more spherical"" (easier to navigate with but less efficient): 
This is much more flexible for ship design, desired power output, and much more efficient in filling space with most efficient power cores to fill a given DIAGONAL volume. because all power cores fill a most cubic volume while they are also all parallel and as long or as compact as you want them.

You also want to build ships diagonally because this maximizes the paths that armor blocks block and it maximizes the distance between the hull and internal systems from rockets.

You also want to build diagonal because it allows you to put any length of weapons on it that can all have the same distance to its most frontal parts.

You do NOT want to build diagonal because the collision detection gets really busy by a diagonal thin ship that fills a collision block the size of a planet bit that is basically just a long stick, easily crashing servers wen getting near below a planet without touching it, because the collision boxes intersect.","1375315744"

"Naruto","t5_2quts","The way I see it, and this is just a gamer's theory, not anything based on evidence in the manga, is that each element is related to the one it beats in a certain style of use - which means going in a circle, each element would have two primary styles, and depending on if it is fused with an element strong against it or weak against it determines which of those two uses are amplified.

The circle is Wi -&gt; L -&gt; E -&gt; Wa -&gt; F -&gt; Wi

Now, my idea is that Wind and Lightning are both ""sharp"" elements, in that they've been seen mainly used to make other attacks have better cutting power - Sasuke with his lightning infused sword, Asuma with his wind enhanced chakra blades, for two examples.

Going around the circle, filling it in, we'd get that Lightning and Earth are both ""direct"", meaning they're both good at massive damage to singular enemies. Earth and Water are both ""surrounding"", meaning they're good at enclosing friends and enemies to protect or disable them.  Water and Fire are both ""fluid"", meaning that they're both adaptably maneuverable (that is, they both flow from the user smoothly.) Fire and Air are both ""area"", meaning that they're suited to filling large areas to inflict damage on friends and foes in the region. And back to the original, Air and Lightning are both ""sharp"" - they're quite capable at breaking defenses.

So Fire + Air would be a very explosive, area filling attack - as seen by the recent chapter.

Water + Earth would create Mud, which could both armor a friend and entrap an enemy - or to be more literal, Wood Release is the perfect surrounding attack.

Even Water + Fire, which seems counter intuitive, follows the same rules I've outlined - either you get steam, which is essentially amplified water (the stronger of the pair) that can also scald and burn, or you get, for example, Jiraiya's Toad Oil techniques, where the fluidity is maintained while the fire side is amplified.

Considering all that, and remembering that the rules of the Naruverse should keep the elements in approximate balance (that is to say, no single element is stronger than all of the others), I must say that I wasn't joking when I said ""Rasenuke!""

Now, it wouldn't be earth shattering, H-Bomb level of nuke, capable of wiping out entire villages with just one poke in a chain reaction. Instead, I'd imagine it'd be a lot like a very tiny, very explosive attack centered on the opponent's atoms - similar to Deidara's C1 (the microscopic bombs) - that sliced *and* shredded them to pieces from the inside out. And left a respectable crater filled with gore.

And while Juubito seems perfectly capable of surviving being burnt by Amaterasu (former Uchiha resistance? Rinnegan power? Plot armor?), I'm not sure how well he'd survive being turned into a splatter of clotted gunk on the floor.

So, my two cents - we'll see Sasuke grow just enough that he doesn't mind Naruto being a little stronger than him (instead of his usual ""This is how strong Naruto is? I must kill everyone to catch up to him, that asshole!"") and amplifying *Naruto's* attack, instead of having Naruto amplify *his*.

And Juu-chan will actually whimper. And Madara will step back from his fight with Hashirama long enough to look at the resultant artistic smear, smirk a little bit, then go back to fighting Hashi, because even the 10-tails / psuedo-So6P being oneshot isn't givafuck-worthy to him.

Edit: In fact, I can even imagine what the technique would look like.

Naruto, holding up his giant, rotating chakra shuriken. Sasuke projects his Chidori into it, it starts rotating a little bit faster, sparking a bit, and then *vanishes.* Naruto is left with his hand in the air, looking at it puzzled, as Juubito thinks to himself ""The technique was too powerful for Sasuke to match with his weaker element, so it fizzled. That's to be expected, though..."" - wait, Naruto has a determined expression on his face now, and is charged with his empty hand outstretched to Juubito. Cue eyebrow raise from Juubito, he starts to step back, Naruto slams his open hand into his chest...

Nothing. Juubito starts to laugh, then you see a panel that at first looks like he's Kamui-ing. But this spiral isn't his, nor can he control it. With a very quick rotation and a noise summed up as ""squok"", he has been reduced down into a ball of flesh - no big deal though, he knows he can recover from - and then the explosions start.

Cue Sakura, or someone who can be relied on in a pinch to explain the scene to the readers, saying out loud ""The technique collapsed on itself, became so compact that it was invisible to the naked eye. Whoa.""

Then Madara looks over and thinks to himself, ""This Sakura girl could be dangerous in the future, she has the same power as the Sage - the ability to explain everything that just happened in under five panels. I'd better kill her now before she becomes stronger and starts deducing my plans."" And Madara... almost gives a fuck.","1375315745"

I might be wrong in how I search, but lived in a few areas in both manhattan and Brooklyn and never seen a rent regulated unit up for rent. They just dont go up publically or when they do it's not exactly put up for anyone to rent.

I live in a rent regulated building also where there is a mix of both regulated and market rate units. It is a nice mix, I agree. However all the people I see that are in the regulated units have been there for at least a few decades and have no kids that I can tell. So they are paying probably &lt;800 a month for a nice two bedroom right into their old age.

If my building was market rate, in the area I am in I have zero doubt that it would be immediately sold, torn down, and a 30 story apartment building put up. I think it would go the same for most prewar buildings on the UES past 2nd avenue.","1375315746"

Do any of your devices have internal terminators or do you have a cable terminator to put after this device?

Just because it is #255, it doesn't have to be at the end of the chain. 

Another thing to try is see if moving the address as low down as you can. That being the last address in the chain can really be susceptible to interference, like the reflections in the data that are going to be caused by unterminated and incorrect cabling. ","1375315752"

Whether that is a good alternative depends on your view of Smith and Jennings.  If they're worth significantly more than their contracts, I agree that it was a good move.  At the very least, you can just flip them a year later for a profit.  However, I tend to be wary of signing free agents who aren't stars or have the chance to be stars, unless the team already has superstars in place and just needs pieces around them.  The only way to build a championship is with superstars, and tying up a lot of cap room to pay non-stars when you don't have any superstars yet is usually not a path to a championship.

If Grimgaunt was a 15/15 at level 1, would you say that in order to balance him we should take away his ability to get stronger each time a creature dies, or should we maybe alter his attack/health to make him more manageable? You can apply this logic with anyone, and the simplest solution every time is going to be alter their attack/health. There are 2 solutions to stopping packmaster from pumping his board full of strong Uterran creatures. 1, completely get rid of his ability or rework it, or 2. lower his health by 1 point at lvl 1 and 2 so he is easier to kill before he gets off an activation.

Cb = Tb/(5Ap+2Bp+Cp)

From the given information it is now easy to see that 

Ab = 5\*Cb = 5\*Tb/(5Ap+2Bp+Cp)

pretty sure growing pot is more valuable than any other agricultural crop by a longshot

&gt; ...farmers of legitimate crops often complain of marijuana growers sneaking onto their fields and destroying plants to make room for pot. 
""We've got people coming out into the fields cutting out a crop that we've spent every day of our lives for six months working on,"" said Mike O'Banion, a Fresno farmer who found about 11,500 marijuana plants hidden in about 10 acres of his corn in June.
Mr. O'Banion estimated he lost about $10,000 of his anticipated harvest after marijuana growers cut down corn to make room for marijuana. Three years ago, this was hardly a problem, Mr. O'Banion added. Now, ""Just about everybody who grows corn has had something like this.""

Either way most server providers have BF3 pricing very competitive with just about every other game.  If they charge an extra nickel per slot it's still not going to amount to much difference.  And maybe they'll get a backend that doesn't choke so much (doubtful).","1375315762"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Right, because that works well in games like GW2 right? When was the last time they released a major content patch and not just filler/cash shop fodder? They've even said that they don't have a timetable for expansions because they're busy working on the ""living story"" experience. All this says to me is that they're making money hand over fist with their cash shop fodder (aka living story) so see no need to release new content. When their cash shop profits start to wane, that's when we'll see an expansion for GW2. But I can't even see them doing an expansion with the state that the game is in now.

Sorry, went on a bit of a rant there.

Either they have a very small number of people, are purely observational/retrospective (one is an internet survey), or if they are actually an experiment they don't randomize with controls. None of these is a real study I would put much scientific weight on except for the cytotoxicity paper.

"anime","t5_2qh22","I first got into anime when I was a young boy in the 90s. I've already watched shows like Sailor Moon, Mila Superstar, Heidi, Cats Eyes, Missis Jo und ihre fröhliche Familie (yeah, I'm from Germany) in grade school but nobody my age considered those anime at the time. They were just part of the regular morning and afternoon cartoon program together with western animation.

But some TV stations used to air entirely different kinds of cartoons. Those were aired late at night, they were much more detailled, harder to understand, more brutal and realistic and much more grown-up than the cartoons I was udes to. Those were shows like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Blue Submarine No. 6, Jin-Roh or Spriggan. Very different from the shows I was used to and highly fascinating to me at the time.

Keeping up with those shows was kind of hard for me since they aired late at night but I tried to watch as much as possible. Those late night shows were cancelled after a while though and the only contact I had with anime till high school were the typical shows like Dragonball, Dragonball Z, Digimon, Yu Gi Oh and all that stuff. All the boys I knew between the age of 12 and 15 loved Dragonball Z and so did I.

At the age of 17 or 18 I realised that the Internet now made it possible for me to easily access all those late night anime I was fascinated with as a young boy. And thus began my venture in world of anime in earnest. Now I'm 25 and since then I've watched hundreds of shows and movies, seen thousands of episodes and consumed entirely too much anime and manga. 

I tried to quit for some time now but there are always some new shows or old classics that manage to catch my interest and draw me back in again.","1375315765"

&gt; In 15th century Paris, Clopin the puppeteer tells the story of Quasimodo, the misshapen gentle-souled bell ringer of Notre Dame, who was nearly killed as a baby by Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. But Frollo was forced by the Archdeacon of Notre Dame to raise Quasimodo as his own. Now a young man, Quasimodo is hidden from the world by Frollo in the belltower of the cathedral. But during the Festival of Fools, Quasimodo, cheered on by his gargoyle friends Victor, Hugo, and Laverne, decides to take part in the festivities, where he meets the lively gypsy girl Esmeralda and the handsome soldier Phoebus. The three of them find themselves ranged against Frollo's cruelty and his attempts to destroy the home of the gypsies, the Court of Miracles. And Quasimodo must desperately defend both Esmeralda and the very cathedral of Notre Dame.

If I choose beforehand to do that, to pay the worker $1, then I will get 4 and not know that I'm missing out on 0.5.

The only way I would lose money here is if I gave you the product and someone else took the $6.

Really, it's smart business to pay the worker $1 anyway, because if I do so he's motivated to make a good product and stay at the job longer. If I go with the 0.5, I get a pissed off worker who couldn't give 2 shits about the good of the company.","1375315770"

&gt; On a personal note, you should really rethink your attitude problem. The arrogance and ""know-it-all"" attitude of your posts are neither informative or as cute as you think they are, which is why you're being downvoted. 

I find this a little frustrating. I'm just stating facts. What would you recommend? That I pretend not to know the things I know when the facts are not 100% favorable to Riot?

Record sales are around 6% of a band's income. -[source](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/industry_news/industry_analysis_music_sales_are_only_6_of_musician_income.html)

Napster didn't hurt Metallica financially at all. If you watch the interview with Lars Ulrich and Chuck D from Public Enemy on the Charlie Rose show he even states that it's about controlling distribution.

On the Kill 'em All tour, Hetfield held up their newly released album and told the crowd that if you couldn't afford the album to steal it and make copies for your friends (I think this is on Live Shit - Binge &amp; Purge).

&gt;Does a songwriters personal life have to affect how you view their music? It shouldn't.

It wasn't their personal life, it was quite public. They sued their fucking fans for the same practice they encouraged when they released Kill 'em All. Being full of shit is one thing, they did actual financial damage to their fanbase over what was literally chump change to them. Compare their behavior to Radiohead, who doesn't hold their fans in contempt.

While Kill 'em All, Master of Puppets and Justice are still some of my favorite albums, I'm in no way a fan of Metallica after they went corporate. Their sound changed in ways I no longer liked, they started chasing the alternative radio stations for playtime, their attitude changed, their logo changed. Metallica, as a whole, changed.

So you're saying that because I didn't like the direction they took or their attack on their fans I was never a fan in the first place?

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Im going to preface this by explaining that I own several horses and am an avid practitioner of horse archery. With that in mind, we're going to address these point by point:

* What makes horses so powerful in warfare? 

 - A horse is significantly heavier and significantly faster than a human being. A single horse can knock down and overpower several humans with little to no effort. Now imagine a horse that has been bred to be aggressive, a horse that will kick and bite alongside running a person over and now imagine that the horse has a man on top of it with a lance, axe or hammer. Add to that, that this man/horse combo can ride in, run you over or hit you with the riders weapon and be off at a speed of at least 25 mph. Horses revolutionized warfare, in that they were a powerful mobile force.

* What are the chances of a knight on foot defeating a knight on a horse?

  * Generally speaking, very little. A cavalry unit that can charge, roll over a line and get away will be very difficult to stop in the battlefield. By maintaining mobility, a horseman makes himself and his horse a difficult target for grounded opposition. There are exceptions, pikemen and archers, but for the majority of foot soldiers, cavalry-men were a nightmare.

* What best options did he have in fighting the mounted knight?

 *  If preparation time is available, an unmounted army can gain some advantages against horsemen. By choosing terrain in which a mounted force cannot gain momentum, you can prevent a charge. If you have time to bed spikes into the ground you can also stop a charge (unlike the movies, horses will not charge into a bank of pointy sticks unless they had a damn good reason). The tl:dr of this if you can stop the horse, you win.

* Should he attack the horse or the knight?

 * Both are viable targets, the best option is to attack both with one man attacking the rider while the other kills the horse. The horse, is relatively unprotected. Its physiology makes it difficult to armor anything but its head and neck. But if the horse goes down, it will collapse onto the rider and break bones; then you can move in and kill the rider.","1375315787"

The [S1 Evo](http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/images/large/610-1.jpg) pictured (Evo- referring to the class and not the name) was commonly called the S1.

I'd just naturally been thinking the same, that it'd be nice for such an infrastructure or whatever, but I've come up with a question.

How do you stop people duplicating purchases?

The original person then just proceeds to re-download the stuff if needed and carry on as always.)

One simple and obvious thing to do is have always on/connected DRM for such games, but we all know how well that turned out.

One big problem is that consumers want magic, and one top of that often do not realise that such magic does not exist in this world and then with that get quite upset that all the ""pros"" cannot even do the most simplest of things.

It's not a ranking system. It's not about who's best. That's why the baseline is 1600. To establish an average. It's sites like Aoe2stats and such that establish a ranking based on the rating.

"Dakimakuras","t5_2tooy","Copy and pasted from /u/DakimakuraGuy a year ago. There should be a sidebar with information about daki materials.

&gt;For general discussion purposes, there are about 5 different material types (with a bunch of different subsets):
&gt;
&gt;Peach skin: This is used almost exclusively for bootlegs; there is only one circle that I can think of that uses this material. It's fairly smooth, thin in material, has okay print quality. Doesn't stretch. I personally don't care for it much myself, but some people love it.
&gt;
&gt;SK Suede: Similar to peach skin, but a bit rougher in feel. It's usually the material circle use to put out a ""cheap"" cover. I like it even less than peach skin. Doesn't stretch. You probably don't have to worry about this material though, since you want a non-ecchi cover and only circles (generally) use this.
&gt;
&gt;Smooth Knit: Probably the most common for officially licensed goods. Fairly smooth and has a decent amount of stretch. This is where material variations come in; not all Smooth Knits are equal. Some feel smooth when you rub in any direction, while others only feel smooth in one direction and feel a bit prickly rubbing in the other. I'd still personally recommend this material over peach skin, SK Suede and polyester twill.
&gt;
&gt;Polyester Twill: Off the top of my head, I can't describe what this one feels like. Generally, officially licensed dakimakura covers will come in two material options. Usually Twill and then either Smooth Knit/2way-roika/tricot. I honestly can't think of it off the top of my head, but I know it's because I stopped buying it whenever there was another material option.
&gt;
&gt;2-way tricot/roika: This is the largely considered the best material available. There really isn't much difference between the two, and roika/tricot are often used interchangeably. It's usually a polyester/polyethylene blend, somewhere in the 85/15% range. It's the ""smoothest"" material, has a good amount of stretch, can be fairly thick or thin depending on the producer, and is usually pretty durable. Whether you buy legit or a bootleg, I'd definitely say it's worth the premium you pay over other materials.
&gt;

I also strongly urge you to see her (hopefully) psychologist. Express your concerns. The psychologist can formulate a method to open a line if communication between you and your wife where you can express to her your feelings without worsening or triggering her ED.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;A) the ability (and presumed responsibility) of an individual for making their own decisions and B) the necessity of having a ""watchdog"" system being state-run.

A) no full-time working person with a family has time to investigate every single Monsanto (or whoever) subsidiary, remove every product from their grocery list, and find an affordable alternative. Most working people don't have time to keep up with what new artificial flavors the FDA is permitting. 

B) Any watchdog system that wants to be effective will most likely have to be state run. There is no civilian, non-state equivalent that will be able to keep up with the size, scope, and funding of a corporate structure that is already unbelievably skilled at circling the wagons to protect itself. The state has not proven effective at this so far, but that's because the inmates have bought out much of the asylum. 

&gt; My point is that capitalism, (and thus the private enterprise system) is a bottom-up, evolutionary system that is largely successful without any top-down direction. 

Untrue, and especially untrue if we look at the most successful countries and then control for quality of living. There are 0 countries that are employing a capitalist system without top-down direction. That said, the countries that do the best, and have the highest quality of life on average (Japan, Western Europe, perhaps Canada) control corporations and capitalism quite a bit. The countries that exercise less restraint, the U.S., China, (most third world countries): are selling out their resources as fast as they can,  at the price of gutting the bottom 2/3rds of society (by under-educating, under-employing, and imprisoning them) to benefit the top 1/3rd (mostly through moves decided by the top .05%, whose kids worldwide go to school with one another.)

Also, check out the book ""The Shock Doctrine""

&gt;business owners are not disproportionately malicious villains that want to be rich and make everyone else poor.

Actually, according to top-down unrestrained capitalism, that's exactly what they are. That's certainly what major multi-industrial conglomerates hope to achieve. But I think I know what you mean:

It's not about malicious villains. It's that most people in western society tend to do what capitalism does: choose their favorite thing. The absolute highest return for themselves no matter what the cost to others. Like [this].(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQSRPMFDTSs) Unless there's some kind of a law, tax, or misdirection.

"NoPoo","t5_2sej3","I did BS/ACV for about a month and a half. My hair is on the dry/fine/fragile side already, and this just trashed it.

I don't use anything else, and I have a pretty oily scalp naturally! Once every so often if I used a lot of product or if I get paint in my hair I'll use a sulfate free shampoo (again, the shea moisture line is my go to), but I've been doing conditioner only for 2-3 months and seriously, it takes care of the oil. I use a good handful of it, flip my head upside down, and massage it into my scalp. Really massage it around with the pads of your fingers (no nails), that's what loosens all your gunk up, then it all rinses out with the conditioner. Have you ever heard of the oil cleansing method? It's the same principle; oil dissolves oil, and everything rinses out clean. Usually I'll add some more conditioner to my ends and let it soak for the rest of my shower. The really nice thing is, because you NEVER strip your hair with this method, you can do it as often as you want without damaging your hair. I've heard that too much moisture can possibly lead to protein loss in your hair, and that's my next research topic, but you can counteract that with the occasional protein treatment (sally beauty sells cheapo ones).

The key is to go completely silicone free. Cones build up on your hair and you need harsh chemicals to get rid of them; they also keep your hair from absorbing moisture. I had to read all my labels and get rid of a bunch of products, but it's been so worth it! Even my ex noticed how great my hair has been looking, which was pretty fucking awesome.

And I had absolutely no transition period, aside from learning how to properly massage all my scalp.

"summoners","t5_2wenn","So the only unwarranted change to champions I play a lot is the Elise volatile spiderling nerf. The reason being that people can run from it now. The only way to reliably land is is human W then spider Q, and that's not as effective as landing W before Q (there's a teavel time for the spider). To me, it's a huge blow to trading as I would usually do Human E, Q, W, R, Q, W, then rappel away. Without the preliminary W damage you lose a portion of Q damage in spider form since it's %hp missing. 

To add to that, it's still useful as a scout or to zone people out from under towers or farming. It's splash is a little small though. Also, the homing kinda becomes useless if it's not fast enough to catch the champ.

Another thing is the spiderlinf late game nerfs. I think they are way too OP in the early game, not the late game. Late game I believe elise is an assassin, not a prolonged AP aa duelist, so her having the spiderlings die faster isn't that big of a nerf. Her early game power is really strong and that should be due to her spiderlings, not her W.","1375315797"

That's why we see some of the buildings using the bones as walls or being carved from the bones themselves. It's not that the city survived after the kaiju died in it, it's that the city was rebuilt once the kaiju was safe to live around. Granted, that bit is pretty much entirely conjecture, I don't think it was directly addressed in the film

The idea is that they no longer need to see someone committing a crime.  Instead, they can see that you have something which *could* be used for a crime, and then arrest you for something that they think you might do.  You no longer need to commit a crime to be a criminal.  Just having certain items at certain times makes you guilty.

How do you define a ""protest""?  Exactly which items are banned?  What if I was spraying messages on protest signs and I didn't know this was illegal at a protest?  Now, add in New York's random patdown of citizens.  You're passing by a minor protest, a cop randomly searches you and finds your Leatherman.  Now you're in jail.  Yea, the judge might throw the case out eventually, but as cops like to say, you can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.

And that is why I said poverty **and** structural racism, because I knew you or someone else would come along with this strawman.

During that fight, you see the Kaiju grabbing Typhoon's arms one by one and neutralizing the spinny-things. Not because it was a reckless move, but because it knew exactly what was coming.

The Kaiju probably also knew, having a hive-mind and all, what Crimson's and Cherno's moves were, since both Crimson and Cherno had fought other kaiju multiple times.  They didn't know Gipsy because Gipsy hadn't been in action for years.","1375315812"

Also if she or you are putting pressure on you to cum then that isn't helping, thinking that if you don't cum you'll be a disappointment is not a sexy thought.  You need to just go with the flow and experiment to find what feels best for you. Some positions will probably work and feel better than others.

This isn't a long term solution but if you just want to get one in, try this: Don't masturbate or allow yourself any orgasm at all for a week.  By day 7 you will probably be ready to explode and the first women you put your dick inside will get a extra huge load.","1375315813"

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","The worst part of it honestly is that two of my friends are still in town (one sent me a snapchat that showed he was at the other's house) I proposed we all hang out, but he said they were going to a concert. Not the best text to read when you suddenly get hopeful. 

My parents are... interesting. They're strictish Christian parents who don't want their son going out and getting drunk and such (which is exactly why I try to go to every party I can during the school year). I'm not entirely sure if I could go out during the day, probably not (the times I went out to search for people tended to range from when they got home to when it got dark out). My mom wouldn't even let me go out and get the mail last year unless I called her to tell her I was going out.

I'm essentially fairly wealthy as a teenager, when my father died he left me some money (~$4000) and I have about $300 at my house right now.  My parents compared to the families at my school, are relatively lower class.","1375315815"

"wow","t5_2qio8","Everything you described still exists in the game, and can still exist. You want every player to socially interact with each other, as opposed to people they choose to interact with on a social level. You want to force this interaction to enrich the player base, but that was the model for a long time and it was lacking for a large portion of the player base. Which is why they replaced it.

10 and 25 man content are no easier or harder than 40 man. Why is the difficulty tied to people? Why not let people play on the difficulty they want instead of forcing them into content? I just don't understand the need to tell people exactly how to play and experience the game, instead of just playing the way that you enjoy the most. LFR, Heroic, normal, dungeons, PVP, pet battle, LFD, Flex raiding (soon) arena, battle grounds. All of those are viable ways to experience the game, why does somebody picking one over another matter so much?","1375315816"

&gt; In 15th century Paris, Clopin the puppeteer tells the story of Quasimodo, the misshapen gentle-souled bell ringer of Notre Dame, who was nearly killed as a baby by Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. But Frollo was forced by the Archdeacon of Notre Dame to raise Quasimodo as his own. Now a young man, Quasimodo is hidden from the world by Frollo in the belltower of the cathedral. But during the Festival of Fools, Quasimodo, cheered on by his gargoyle friends Victor, Hugo, and Laverne, decides to take part in the festivities, where he meets the lively gypsy girl Esmeralda and the handsome soldier Phoebus. The three of them find themselves ranged against Frollo's cruelty and his attempts to destroy the home of the gypsies, the Court of Miracles. And Quasimodo must desperately defend both Esmeralda and the very cathedral of Notre Dame.

When I left wrestling 6~7 years ago it was partially because all the top guys were wrestlers I literally grew up on and there was no real young talent being pushed.  Now I'm back and it's because they are pushing the young guys and with the exception of Cena, all the top wrestlers are relatively young and all quite talented.

Basically Sting can come, have a stint, maybe retire the belt, but I'd be afraid of keeping him on for too long, or worse, booking the hell out of him at the cost of burying the future stars of the company.","1375315828"

And even then, it makes sense if they were to get less views, if people did as I pretty much instructed them to do: pick a color and stick with that.

My main hope is that once I've finished with it, it's the type of series that people will go back and watch the other color. Someone who's watched Blue start to finish then turns around to watch Red, and sees just how different the game can be.

It's definitely one of my lowest-viewed series (only really rivaled by Superbrothers) but it's really close to my heart, and I really hope more people discover it - more for them to experience the awesomeness of game, more so than just me getting views.","1375315828"

So assume your washer has a 0.5 m diameter chamber, so r=0.25 m. Your centripetal acceleration is

         a = w^2 r

where *w* is your angular velocity, which is 1200 rpm = 125.7 rad/s. Therefore, a=3950 m/s^2  = 403 gs (That can't be right, that's fucking huge. Someone check my arithmetic please?). Do notice this is highly dependent on the radius of the chamber- a difference of a few centimeters can account for tens of gs in the final calculation. 

Onto the second part of your question- when do we get 1 g of force on the clothes. When the machine is not rotating, your clothes experience 1 g (downward, obviously). Spinning it will add a centripetal acceleration, which can only increase the net acceleration. ","1375315830"

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","&gt;Who do you think a good replacement would be?

For Rooney? Really hard one. I personally think we could cope well if Kagawa can stay fit for the entire season and we bought two top class midfielders. Ideally the players we'd want already play for top clubs and would be hard to pick up. I was sad to see us not being interested in James Rodriguez or Joao Moutinho, but I understand that a bidding war with Monaco is not something we would wanna do. I think Marco Reus is one of the most impressive free role attacking left players in the world at the moment, but I don't see him leaving Dortmund. Not this season at least. But he's miles better than players like Lamela and Sharaway at this point.

I was also disappointed we were'nt involved in the Paulinho to England deal, or in any of the young Dutch midfielders changing clubs this summer. A lot of ""player for the buck"". There are still golden deals out there, that probably aren't looking obvious to us, but are possible. 

I am leaning more toward the Kondogbia deal that was rumored a week ago, and I am hoping we're at least trying for Lars Bender/Gundogan/Christian Eriksen if the Cesc deal doesn't happen. 

And even though many seem not to, I'd love Fellaini in if he's the best available option.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Congratulations, and welcome to the club (Marines, that is).  I was in for 5 years, SIGINT guy, got to operate with a ton of cool people, was indoc'd into a lot of cool programs.

You might not care, and you might not take it, but here is some advice.

You are an Officer.  There is a clear difference between O's and E's (Enlisted).

You are a Marine.  The other branches self identify by rank, we don't.  A Marine, is a Marine, no matter if you are a ground Intelligence Officer, an Enlisted cook, or an Infantry Platoon Sergeant.  Stick by your guys, and earn their loyalty.

Do not blow off your NCO's.  They have been in longer than you, and can help you lead.  Do not use them like garden tools (that's what PFC's are for), use them like a scalpel.  Give them your mission or command, and let them choose how they execute that mission or command, do not micro manage (That is what Gunny's and Staff NCO's are for).

Never, ever contradict your NCO's, Fellow Officers, or other Staff ranks in front on your troops.  It shows weakness in leadership, and it makes you look like a fool.  If you have an issue, and it isn't in the middle of a life threatening situation, then take them aside and figure out WTF is trying to be communicated.

When a warrant officer advises you to do something, you should put some serious thought into actually doing it.  The Marine Corps isn't like the Army.  We don't just hand out warrant's.  They have to prove themselves to be technical masters in their fields.  Yes, some do slip through the cracks, but I guaran-damn-tee you that an Infantry or Intel Warrant Officer know's what the hell he is doing.

OCS, TBS, and Bootcamp in general are easy.  Those little humps you go on with 70-100 lbs rucks?  not hard compared to other shit you will do.

Do not be paperwork happy on your Marines.  If one gets in trouble, try to sort it out if it is small.  No need for a page 11 or an NJP if some extra work can be found around the company office or Barracks.

Never be volun-told to do something.  Volunteer for the shitty assignments.  They pay dividends in the end.

Good luck, and happy hunting man.

I don't blame you. I wouldn't want to have sex with anyone who viewed it as a ""sin"" whether they were confessing it to a priest or not. 

I'm bisexual and the first woman I was with told me I was going to ""hell"" after SHE gave me a massage which led into sexy times. Needless to say, more sexy times were not had. Strangely enough afterward she decided she's a lesbian, now I'm married to a man. That was interesting. 

Also, the first man I ever had sex with was catholic, and after me ""losing"" my virginity to him he said ""We shouldn't have done that, because we aren't in love.""
Like that was somehow sinful or wrong even though we both knew full well going into it that we weren't in love.

Back to you -  you don't have to cheat or break up...but just know that if you have sex with him it's going to be brought up in ""confession"" and his belief is that it's ""wrong"" even if he stops bringing it up in confession. 

I wouldn't be okay with that. You don't need to be either. It's up to you whether or not you want to continue with him, but I doubt his beliefs are going to change any time soon.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","1) Ninja. 

Personally, I wouldn't mind it being a tanking class. It would require some balancing from the devs, but it could certainly be done with the right ability set and mechanics.

Having an evasion/absorption tank that offers an alternative playstyle from Warrior and Paladin would be a nice way to give aspiring tanks a variety of options and keep the tank population alive and thriving.

That being said, it could just as easily be a cool DD class with an evasion ""oh shit"" button or a vanish to lower threat by a set amount. Throw in a teleport move and a ranged snare (shuriken) and people will flock for both PVE and PVP.

2) Geomancer

The CNJ class already has a lot of focus on elements (aero, water, earth) and Geomancer seems like a natural alternative path to WHM. Instead of using your rad nature powers for healing, you decide to harness the destructive power of the elements. Instead of the BLM set (lightning, fire, ice), GEO can focus on the aforementioned air (wind buffet, nasty DOTs) or water (make enemy's socks wet) and earth (landslide, earth golem pet) and add in some class-specific mechanic like a floating totem that buffs or dispenses change.","1375315846"

If you're asking about parties having a balanced class selection, all that's really changed with new rpg's is abstracting the idea of a class.  You still fill a role (fighter, mage, thief etc.), it just isn't bound to a class (4e dnd) or bound to your character (shadowrun 4e).  We've also attempted to make some roles obsolete (4e dnd).  All this accomplishes though is an illusion of choice, specialists are still needed.

If you're talking about social dynamics, a 'leader' was probably dropped so as to free up the game and cut down on rules.

Windows might not be set to the appropriate resolution.  This monitor has a native resolution of 1920 x 1080 so make sure it is set to that.  This can also be tied to bad/missing VGA drivers.  Make sure you get the most recent ones from AMD.

The monitor settings are somehow messed up, and that resolution doesn't fit the screen.  I havent seen an issue like this with LCD screens for a while.  Reset the monitor to defualts.  Probably not the problem since the onboard works.

The video card is messed up. RMA
The Motherboard is messed up. RMA
The power supply is messed up. RMA

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Look bud, you might not want to hear this, but any good eating disorder treatment has a strict ""you can not diet within the confines of this treatment"" mandate. Because it's a mental disorder, and learning rewire your brain is hard enough on it's own without also throwing in ""but don't rewire it too much because your husband hates how you look."" I hope you can see why it's conflicting to teach somebody not to be disordered about eating, but also to pay super intense attention to food so their body looks good. Even keto as some others are suggesting is Not Okay. Even being a vegetarian in some instances is Not Okay in eating disorder treatment - because the result is typically very different for a person with an eating disorder than someone without. If she is in the middle of very intense mental health treatment, as you say, I suggest you put this one aside until she feels she is recovered, and then only bring it up in couples therapy (preferably with her ED therapist) so that the therapist can help forestall any backsliding into her ED. The answer is not suggesting she sign up for progresspics or start keto - not if you want her to be mentally healthy.","1375315860"

"funny","t5_2qh33","I don't care about discs that much.  They're dying, something will be figured out. For me, game sharing/disc vs. digital was the least of my problems.  I'd *so* much rather have a console that I can use properly than have the ability to give my buddy an old game.  I acknowledge that it's a problem, just not one for me right now.  I have confidence that something will be figured out. All of my anger comes from all of the other problems with the xbone.  I can argue those points too if you want, I'm just here to say that Microsoft acts like a spoiled brat who blames others when they don't get what they want. Their idea was dumb, rushed, and before its time.  They are arrogant.  Sony falls on its sword when necessary, Nintendo's WiiU has tons of random little features that I never even would have thought to ask of them, because they have people working to provide consumers with features that actually benefit people, in a real, immediate sense.  Reselling comes at the end of a lot of gamer's experiences with a game, it should be dealt with accordingly.

To reiterate, I could not care less about discs or digital games.  I personally don't really resell my stuff, I buy games that I'm fairly sure I'll like, and I love to replay games.  That being said, I still would not have touched the xbone with a ten-foot pole.  So, between Microsoft's shitty attitude and the host of other really, really asinine ""features"" they were gonna shoehorn into people's living rooms, I have zero desire to buy one, and very little respect for Microsoft's xbox division, if not the company as a whole.  Someone up there is hiring these out of touch idiots.","1375315862"

"vinylscratch","t5_2taaz","hey, i've been doin electronic music stuffs for about 2 years, i can give a few basic tips!

i think the bass is a bit too cluttered at times, it sounds like there might be a little bit of clipping in there. i think it might be the piano mainly causing that, but i dunno

also, i think i know why the transitions sound funky. i think if i'm hearing it correctly, your main piano pattern's rhythm looks sorta like [this](http://i.imgur.com/kGfgETX.jpg?1). but i think the main downbeat hits at the part where it's slower (the syncopations). because the beginning of the pattern isn't where the downbeat is placed at the moment, the transitions fall on a beat that isn't the downbeat, causing that weird feeling when you hear it. 

if you move your piano pattern around so the rhythm's like [this](http://i.imgur.com/QlMeqy5.png?1) it might work better. Keep the same notes, just nudge the pattern a bit so that it lines up with the transition points. You'll probably have to move things around a bit to line it up right. Alternatively, you could move all the transition drums (like the crash and the intro of the snare, etc) to line up with the beginning of that slower part. just move them later by two beats and it should sound fine.

I hope that wasn't too scathing! i know i personally don't take criticism well :p but don't be discouraged! you just gotta learn and keep on making!

if you want an idea of what sorts of electronicy musical sounds i make, [take a gander at my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/icedog25). it's mostly old stuff, since i am always too afraid to release anything to the public, lol

Sometimes, having free access to food and water (I use a spigot fountain!) helps lower the apparent value of the food, and over time it can help them learn to relax about it.  Some breeds and individuals, though, seem to have no ""full"" switch.  
Drinking that much water- that is not normal.  I would have his kidneys and blood sugar checked, and consider a lower salt food?  Anyway, I would discuss that with the vet for sure.","1375315865"

"avengedsevenfold","t5_2shpy","Well in my experience with the A7X shows I've been to, if you're planning at being at the front with the rails directly in front if the stage I would say get there plenty of hours before the gates open. I once got to a venue at 8am with the gates at 12pm then  avenged didn't come on till 900pm. I was one of the first people in line and the fist people to enter the venue which meant I was the first at the rail in front of the stage. I picked my spot where I knew Zacky was going to be. That was one of my favorite shows because I recieved like 2 guitar picks from the band, one of which Zacky reached down and out to personally hand it to me it was so amazing!  So if you really want to be at the front rail to see them up close and personal then get there many hours before the gate opens and be ready to endure. If not, then you can get there whenever and fight your way to front but you may never reach the rail because it is merely impossible. ","1375315865"

&gt;It is my subjective view that some people have better taste than others, in the same way that I think some artists are better than others.

Fair enough.  It gets a little sticky when you bring vocabulary like ""better"" and ""worse"" into it, though.  This just makes it sound absolute, and then we get into the whole problem of coming off as accusatory when all you're trying to say is that your tastes don't necessarily jibe with someone else's.  Far be it from me to tell you how to phrase your opinions, though; I am, after all, the guy who used the term ""shitty music"".  

&gt;And if I say that you aren't very cool, it doesn't mean that I'm claiming you are ""objectively uncool."" I'm simply saying that you aren't cool, or that you are lame.

No, you're simply saying that *it is your opinion that I'm not cool, or that I'm lame*.   Just as one man's garbage is another man's treasure, one man's lame may be another man's awesome.

"Dallas","t5_2qnkr","As getfuckingreal said, find a realtor and home inspector you're comfortable with. Especially the realtor; they can get dirt on a neighborhood you might not be able to dig up online.

Foundation issues have been covered, so I'll chime in on HOAs. I think I lucked out in that I ended up with a pretty sane one because I had no idea what to look for when I bought. Disclosure: been in my house for 6 years, and was elected to our board 2 years ago. This is the only HOA I've ever dealt with or been part of, so I don't know how universal my comments are.

Read all the HOA documentation before you buy. Some HOAs have it online, otherwise your realtor should be able to get these for you - they have to be filed with the county so it should be readily available. You want to know what your dues are covering, what you're responsible for, what they're responsible for, and what processes are in place for reporting, complaints, and appeals. I think most HOAs have an external management company aside from the elected board of residents, so you can find out who that is and research them as well.

Two things in particular I'd recommend looking out for in particular are whether or not the board is term-limited, and if the HOA has first right of refusal for home sales. Term limits are good because they help prevent the dynasties of crazy board members from taking over. You do NOT want the HOA to have right of first refusal on home sales because that means they have first crack at available homes and otherwise meddle in the sales. That's a pain in the ass, plus you really don't want to deal with an HOA that's involved in the property ownership/management business.

See if you can find out how much their dues have varied over the past several years. This gives you an idea of how well the management knows the neighborhood and has its needs/issues under control. Helps you plan ahead too and assess whether you feel what you're paying is worth it.

Once you've read up the rules, drive/walk the neighborhood again and see how much it looks like they're being enforced. Be aware that some things may be grandfathered in, and that even if it looks like enforcement is lax, future boards may decide to crack down. If they're not enforcing the rules now, though, I'd be wary. The main claim with HOAs is that they keep property values up by making sure everything is ""nice"". If they aren't doing their job, will it have been a good investment if you decide to sell?

HOA or not, visit the neighborhood at various hours of the day to assess traffic/noise/whatever concerns you may have. Walk around when you're not with your realtor and talk to residents. Be sure to stop in front of any available homes so they see you're thinking of moving there. We've encountered quite a few potential buyers while out walking our dog, and we're always happy to answer questions and give them tips and hints about the neighborhood if they're looking at an available house. We're honest about the ups and downs of the area; we want people to be happy here. I don't want to tell you to run away if people won't talk to you because hell, talking to random strangers can be awkward, but at the same time, most people take a vested interest in potential neighbors. I guess try to assess whether they just keep to themselves or if they're antisocial and judge what works for you accordingly.

I'm not sure if HOA meetings are only for residents or if you could attend one ahead of time if you're concerned, or if it varies by area. If you move to a neighborhood with an HOA, definitely show up to at least a few meetings when you're first there. It helps you meet your neighbors, find out what's going on in your neighborhood, and figure out how things are run. That's actually one of the reasons I ended up on our board - I was well-known in the neighborhood because of that and because of walking my dog all over. I guess that gives you an idea of how laid-back we are if dog-walking and meeting attendance get you on the board. May you end up in such a relaxed place if you end up in an HOA.

Good luck!","1375315871"

I think the crux of the matter is that I, and many pro-choicers, simply disagree that this is either a requirement or a necessary consequence of permitting abortion on demand. Abortion on demand doesn't have to mean you can kill a foetus a day before it's due, By drawing the line at an earlier point in its development I'm happy that we would avoid ""unnecessarily"" killing an almost fully developed human (and certainly avoid ending a conscious, sentient nervous system).

Furthermore I think the ""whatever reasons"" are fundamentally important, and that disregarding them is fundamentally short-circuiting the debate. Carrying a pregnancy to term could have a significant effect on the quality of life of the mother, and if this effect is more than the net goodness inherent in bringing another human into the world (which I do not agree is *a priori* a morally positive act), then I argue that she is well within her rights to abort.

The problem arises when people believe that bleeding red, white, and blue means kowtowing to the government and authority. They cut you a check for god knows how long. I don't blame you for having a soft spot for government. You were conjoined at its teet as it funded your lifestyle, paid with money extracted from people who actually produce things. As it is enumerated in the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, government is formed through a series of offices throughout a series of regions organized by the electoral process to serve the People. It is not serving the people by spying on us, invading our privacy, and diminishing natural rights through force, lies, and through its veils of secrecy. The government is owned by the people, not the other way around. This information belongs to US. To ME. And YOU. If you don't want it, that's fine. It doesn't make the whistleblowers traitors because you aren't personally interested in the information released.

I'm sure there's an r/fascist with a lot of people who would agree with you.

My understanding is this subreddit was formed to point out and laugh at the irony and idiocy present in r/politics as the voices of conservatives/right-leaners/libertarians and any other alternative political leanings to the left-liberal Obama-shaft-stroking madness are drowned out by the overwhelming, angsty, edgy, hipster shitposting kiddies that gravitate there.... and not necessarily a place for fascists.

Besides, perhaps not all analysts are privy to this information. Perhaps Snowden was one of only a few, and those paychecks and pensions sure do seem nice! I guess we'll never know, though, unless he tells us. Because shills like you certainly won't!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This (sadly) is only an almost-revenge story.

When I was in college I worked as a valet, parking cars at a mid-rate downtown hotel. There were ups and downs, but most customers were decent and tipped appropriately. Every once in awhile, though, some audi/bmw/jaguar would pull up, and a middle-aged man with his young trophy wife/girlfriend would step out. And every once in awhile, that middle-aged man would hastily slip me a single dollar while his wife/girlfriend wasn't looking. Or even worse, sometimes it would be loose change.

So, for a couple of weeks, I carried a pair women's panties with me to work, waiting for one of these guys to come along. My plan was to wedge these panties into the rear seat of the car, and just let nature take its course from there. There's no guarantee the wife or girlfriend would have been the one to find the panties. I would never get to see the fallout that may or may not ensue.

Sometimes before class I would smoke a bowl or two and many times when I got there I would look at the carpet...and find myself staring at true visual patterns exactly like I saw on psychedelics. 

Weed is also a regular thing for me so I was hesitant to stop just because I got visual effects...which I didn't even mind :) It took about 2 weeks for me to stop getting visuals regularly, I got them less and less frequently over the next month. The psychedelic thought patterns took about the same amount of time to clear. How much did you take on the trip that triggered your current bout of visuals?","1375315896"

But I'll tell ya - I've dated someone who was really clumsy and it was NOT A TURN ON AT ALL.

"selfhelp","t5_2qho7","I would recommend ""The Gifts of Imperfection"", by Brene Brown. In her books (which are all derived from a lifetime of research), she outlines how we cut ourselves off from connection and well-being because of our fear of being vulnerable.

Based on my armchair analysis of what you've written, it seems that, for some reason, you have a need/desire to act a certain way (you call it ego). For example, when receiving criticism for your wife, it is not enough to simply hear her words, consider them, and respond appropriately. Instead, you feel the need to protect yourself. What, exactly, is it that you protecting? Are you actually protecting yourself, or are you protecting the *image* of yourself? Or perhaps you act this way so that you can continue to maintain the *beliefs* you have about yourself? If this is true, you must ask: is defending these things really worth the connection that you have with your wife?

When our walls go up and we fear being vulnerable, the only thing that we do is maintain our current way of living. We shut down the possibility for connection, which causes us to protect ourselves even more, and the cycle repeats. What is necessary to stop this cycle is to, *in the moment*, recognize what is going on, and choose differently. Trust me, I know what it's like to get caught up in defensive emotions. I've done it all too often, and I've lost relationships because of it. But after a lot of hard work, I've come to a point where, during the argument, I can simply *feel* the tide of ""ego"" washing over me. When this happens, I have to make the difficult choice to not follow that familiar habit, and instead choose the option that makes me vulnerable, and exposes my shame and imperfections to others.

It's a hard road, but it's so incredibly worth it. I second the other comments that say to look into mindfulness and meditation. I find those practices unequivocally invaluable in cultivating the ability to recognize my thoughts and defensive maneuvering as they occur. I wish you the best.","1375315900"

It doesn't surprise me that that was your choice as it definitely stands out as a track that would mean something extra special to you. Thank you for all the great songs you've given me; I've got 10 Day, Acid Rap and even the Lost Tapes mixtape. They are all amazing releases.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Last week, I missed posting the Bonnie Prince's arrival in Scotland, though not the beginning of the Rising. This week in history sees him continuing to try to gather men to his cause and finishing unloading the ship (finished Aug. 3 or 4), called the *Doutelle* in primary sources but now called *Le Du Teilley* (and yes, it for some reason has a double article in French).

Somewhere between his first landing and when the ship was unloaded, we have this little anecdote from Hugh MacDonald, taken down by Bishop Forbes in Leith on June 15, 1750 (or about five years later). The exact date of the conversation is not given:

&gt;Mr MacDonald told me that, when the Prince came first upon the coast of Scotland, he himself was in Edinburgh, and that, in returning to the Highlands, he happened to meet with MacDonald of Kinlochmoydart, crossing the Water of Lochy, who asked him, ' What news ?'  'No news at all have I,"" said Mr Hugh.   'Then,' said Kinlochmoydart, "" I'll give you news. You'll see the Prince this night at my house.'  "" What Prince do you mean ?' said Mr. Hugh. ' Prince Charles,"" said Kinlochmoydart. ' You are certainly joking,' said Mr Hugh; ' I cannot believe you.'  Upon this Kinlochmoydart assured him of the truth of it.   ' Then,' said Mr Hugh, ' what number of men has he brought along with him ?'  ' Only seven,' said Kinlochmoydart.'  ' What stock of money and arms has he brought with him then ?' said Mr Hugh.  ' A very small stock of either,' said Kinlochmoydart.  ' What generals, or officers fit for commanding, are with him ?' said Mr Hugh.  ' A very small stock of either,' said Kinlochmoydart.  Mr Hugh said, he did not like the expedition at all, and was afraid of the condequences.  ' I cannot help it,"" said Kinlochmoydart.  ' If the matter go wong, then I'll certainly be hanged, for I am engaged already. I have no time to spare just now, as I am going with a message from the RPince to the Duke of Perth.' They then took leave and parted.

What did Charles bring? Half a ship's hold filled with French brandy.

During this same time, the Prince sent messengers to some prominent Jacobites in the area, including Sir Alexander MacDonald (brother to Aeneas MacDonald, one of the few men to come over with Charles), the Laird of MacLeod, and Alexander of Boisdale. All felt Charles' plan left a little something to be desired and refused to even answer him. The seven men he brought with him (who became the Seven Men of Moidart to history) also began to have doubts and encourage the Prince to come home. Charles retorted ""I am come home, sir, and can entertain no notion of returning to the place whence I came. I am persuaded that my faithful Highlanders will stand by me.""

All in all, not a very illustrious start to a potential rebellion.","1375315903"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","Nice shot, but I don't understand who you're trying to prove wrong. Chicago's skyline is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful in the world. And our city's urban planning, and championing of open parkland is also used as an example for other great cities all over the world.

You can criticize Chicago for a lot, but we rarely come up short aesthetically. Sorry to beat up on you, but your title is awful. Even the 'caught this shot' makes it sound like it was a rare opportunity. You could snap away for hours and end up with an entire memory card's worth of equally gorgeous shots.

I see one of your other comments where you say you're from a small town and they couldn't imagine living in the city, but you need to know your audience here. Anyway, who cares about convincing slack-jawed hayseeds of our greatness? Let them languish in their own ignorance. We don't need 'em.","1375315908"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Place an asteroid or a space station in geosynchronous orbit, preferably over the equator.  At the same time and at the same rate, extend two cables from the asteroid: a cable down toward the Earth, and a cable up away from the Earth.  Assuming the cable is strong enough (carbon nanotubes might have the necessary tensile strength), it won't fall down.  Why? The segment of the cable below the asteroid would obviously fall down if you cut it at the asteroid (that piece of cable isn't going to stay in orbit; its orbital speed is too low).  The segment of cable above the asteroid would be flung off into space if you cut it at the asteroid (the orbital speed of that piece of cable is much too fast).  *The two segments of cable balance each other.*

Of course, we don't yet have a material in quantity with enough tensile strength.  But we will someday, which will make a space elevator very attractive: energy can be recovered from descending loads to raise the ascending loads.  Even if you didn't do that, the energy cost to raise a load to orbit is but a fraction of what it costs with rockets.  Of course, even if the elevator cars ascend/descend at supersonic speed, say a thousand miles per hour, it would take a full day to make the trip up or down.

Space elevators have appeared in a number of science fiction stories; a classic novel about the construction of one is Arthur C. Clarke's *The Fountains of Paradise.*","1375315908"

I know what you're thinking. ""Dude, that's kind of what a Walmart is like....."" but for a library, this just doesn't work. I want to curl up in a cozy corner and read while sniffing that stagnant air smell. Last time I was there (last summer), I couldn't find a decent chair to sit in. They were all covered with cold, slippery plastic. The lack of cushions appalled me.

Maybe it's just that I miss the old library that it replaced. For anyone familiar with McAllen, it was in the ""Arts District."" Yea, it was crowded. Yea, it was understaffed. Yea, the old turnstiles were annoying. But, damn that smell was the bomb.

In addition, even though they have processes in place, it appears that many low level contractors have the ability to disregard/manipulate those processes, and it sounds like the supervisors even encourage this!

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt; Me and I or not interchangeable. One is right. One is wrong. And it depends entirely on whether the speaker is the subject of the sentence or the object. Taking out the other people/nouns never changes whether the speaker is the subject or the object and is, in fact, the way to test which word is correct.

This is the point you are missing entirely. The OP didn't write an essay. The topic isn't a complete sentence, so there is no way to make a real distinction between using a subjective pronoun or an objective pronoun when you don't have the context of a complete sentence.

You are right when you say they are not interchangeable, noone said they are, but depending on the context of the sentence, one is correct and the other isn't. 

&gt;An easy way of making sure you’ve chosen the right pronoun is to see whether the sentence reads properly if you remove the additional noun

Again, you are missing the point entirely. You can't use this test on an incomplete sentence. If you remove the pronoun from an incomplete sentence, it still reads like an incomplete sentence. You still have no way to tell if the part of the incomplete sentence you have is the subject or the predicate **because it's incomplete.**

&gt;[Use the pronoun I, along with other subjective pronouns such as we, he, she, you, and they, when the pronoun is the subject of a verb:
He went to bed.
We waited for the bus.
Clare and I are going for a coffee.](http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/i-or-me)
 
In the last example, the pronoun I, together with the proper noun Clare, forms the subject of the sentence, so you need to use I rather than me.

It's right there in the oxford dictionary, at the top. If the example ""Clare and I are going for a coffee"" where changed to ""Clare and I are in this photo"" and subsequently boiled down to ""Clare and I"" when pointing to said picture, would it be wrong?

I am a developer at a large PR company and our entire team loves using WordPress! As the goto WordPress expert within our company I can easily say that I personally owe my livelyhood to it. Thank you!

I have two questions for you.

1. As we've been working on larger and more prominent projects with WordPress we've realized a need to improve our site optimization techniques and hosting infrastructure. We would be very interested in one or more of the WordPress VIP developer training sessions. Are these Add On services only available to VIP Self-Hosted customers? We sent them an email two weeks ago and have not yet received a response.

2. This is sort of the reason for my first question... Lately we've gotten quite a few opportunities to do large scale corporate newsroom projects. We've seen some significant resistance among corporate clients to adopting WordPress as a platform. What are the top reasons or resources you would cite to convince such clients that WordPress is a perfectly capable platform for large scale corporate sites?

"beer","t5_2qhg1","I'm supposed to be having a pint with one of the guys behind the Portage Ave team so I will get a sense what they're aiming for, like how I got a good understanding what Farmery was planning to offer several months before they contracted their beer out to Muskoka - Farmery aiming for status quo for now (to raise enough money to be able to build the brewery and brew beers for geeks). I mentioned to Portage Ave that they can't do insane beers right out of the bat, do what most micros/brewpubs do: 3-4 beers right off the bat and 1 seasonal. An IPA, a pilsner or lager, a stout, and something of a middle ground, that will be a great way to start out, and work its way out from there. So many people were expecting DIPAs right off the bat and barrel aged this, sour that.. that's too much at once.

I'm optimistic, Winnipeg's finally becoming a real beer town slowly but surely! Ft Garry and Half Pints have really pushed for change in last 3-4 years!","1375315929"

However, in x men 1, Professor X is confused how magento keeps him from reading his mind, and also charles says that magento and him made the scanning system.

Uh, we've watched your video. We have eyes. The UPS truck was going at traffic speed until YOU stopped him. You've got to be hella dumb to try to play us like fools.

&gt;It is called lanesplitting, fartnuckle. Welcome to California. And if he can't handle a bike lanesplitting, he can leave the state too.

Lane splitting is usually done on the left-most lane when you're trying to get between 2 cars. You, on the other hand, were simply driving down the middle of center 2 lanes (before you reached the UPS truck) for no apparent reason. That's what I meant by driving too close. It's bad practice not to get out of the way once you're in the clear.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Yes, this is an excellent use of volunteers. Usually you see teams from Cisco sanding sheetrock or similar, which is a bizarre skills mismatch. So I agree.

My only quibble is that in this article, and the mindset in general is that volunteer time = monetary donations, which it doesn't. Sometimes volunteer time can be more useful, sometimes money can. Sometimes both are needed in tandem.

In this case, probably both would be needed for true capacity expansion.

When expanding capacity in a nonprofit (which Toyota does, by increasing the number of people the kitchen can serve), you have to make sure you have expanded capacity in all aspects. For example, if Toyota made it possible for them to serve 1000 extra people a month, but the food bank didn't have enough food to do that, then there isn't a net gain, except in a time-savings for clients (which is a good thing, but not capacity expansion for the nonprofit). 

So, the foodbank may have to chase money to get more supplies  to fill the increased level of need. 

None of this is bad. In fact, it's all pretty awesome. Just it's more complex than might be assumed.","1375315939"

It is more complicated than that.  However if we recognize that family is an indispensible economic support and that marriage is an economic support, then all the worry about ""we don't want folks to get married for the wrong reasons"" while well meaning, still pushes poverty.

Also I am not saying all social activists fall in this category.  I am saying that our policies fall in this category.  The illigitimacy rate in poor black neighborhoods is not so much a matter of bad personal choices but a set of policies that makes such choices quite reasonable.","1375315948"

If you bring something new into the game (Bulwark) is because you thought about it and decided it was good, it had a purpose. If you remove it later is because either you didn't think it enough, or because you just don't know what you are doing, in both cases, you are not doing your job like you should.

Whether they are rightfully called an angry mob may have been using hyperbole; but angry is accurate enough. So ask yourself who is the source of their anger? The Governor, the NCGA. From a security standpoint it was dangerous for him to leave the security of the mansion approach the protestors, even if he meant well, because angry crowds are unpredictable. That's what I meant by saying he was dangerously out of touch with the dynamics of the situation. Sure, he had security protection, but what do you suppose the security would have done had the crowd of angry protestors had turned on the Governor. People could have been severely injured, maybe killed, he could have been injured, members of his security detail could have been injured, or the protestors could have been injured. For what, so that he could, as some have suggested, be patronizing to the protestors in order to play to his base. What he did was extremely reckless, or just plain out of touch with the potential dangers of the situation. ","1375315963"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll be Joe, she'll be Cathy.

I was out with one of my buddies several years ago and we decided togo over to a girlfriend of ours house. Her and her friend were known to be a little adventurous from time to time. So we are sitting there on her bed watching a movie (the 4 of us fmfm) when my phone rings. ""Hello?"" Cathy ""Hey Joe. I know you've wanted to fuck me for a while now, given how much you've tried. If you can get here in the next 20 minutes I'll show you a night you will never forget.""... Click. So I jumped out of bed, put my pants on and told my friends I had an urgent matter I had to attend to IMMEDIATELY... at 11:45 pm...
Fast forward 15 minutes, I had been slamming beers the whole we to her house which was a good way out in the sticks, and pulled up to the front. ""Game face bro, game face."" Smacked myself in the face a bit and then walked in the front. 
There was a half empty bottle of wine and a few glasses on the table when I walked in and some music playing on the radio. ""Joe, is that you?"", ""Yeah"", ""I'm in my room, come back."". Walk back into the room and there sits this smoking hottie wearing a sexy little number and drinking a glass of wine. ""Would you like a glass of wine sweetie?"" ""Sure thing babe."" (trrying to be so cool). So I grab a glass from the kitchen and walk back to her room. ""Make yourself comfortable, we gotta lay some ground rules."" So she goes on to tell me this is NSA, nothing bigger than your thumb goes in my ass, and if you want this to happen again you can't go telling everyone. I agree. (This was the only non porn esc part) Back to the porn. We get at it and start the most energetic fucking I had experienced up to that point. I swear my dick was 2 inches longer that night! We make a few transitions, she cums a few times, and then it gets REALLY interesting. She flips me over and starts riding me, then all of a sudden she stops and says ""Don't fuckin move. I have a surprise for you."" Then she runs out the door and across the house.
So I'm sitting there ass naked for about 5 - 10 minutes completely puzzled. Then I hear thundering running across the house towards me. I freaked thinking ""OMG im about to get my ass kicked or something!"" In runs Cathy and her FUCKING SMOKING HOT room mate. The both jump on me. Cathy's eating out room mate and taking it dogie. Switch, room mates eating out Cathy and taking it dogie. Switch Cathy's riding my face, room mate riding my dick, switch a few more times then room mate leaves. So I grudge fuck her the rest of the night, finished all over her face, we are both exhausted, covered in fluids, lubes, body fluid, the works. Wake up next day, Cathy roles over and says ""Had a wonderful time last night cowboy. See ya around."" 
I left smiling for the next 2 - 3 weeks. Never happened again.","1375315966"

Of course not all men supported it, and many fought passionately against it but here's the kicker...those men were feminists or at least proto-feminists. 
        Feminism is about giving women a choice, saying she can be a doctor or a stay at home mom, it's not about saying how women can have both family and career without any difficulties quite the contrary it's incredibly hard and the fact the many women pull it off seems to be something you are overlooking.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","A Bosmer that was raised by a extremely fanatical sect of the Vigilants of Stendarr (who may have had something to do with the death of her family). She reserves a special hatred for anyone of the Vigil and ran away as soon as she could, using her innate ability with the bow and stealth to survive as a hunter and then a hunter of Men (for a profit of course). 

A bad contract on an important Thalmor leader in Cyrodiil lead to an ambush and she was only barely able to escape with her identity intact. A memento from that is a scar under her eye.

Deciding to spy on the drop site for her payment, to ambush those responsible to get answers, she makes her way into the northern mountains near the border of Skyrim and waits. Finally spotting her prey she is so intent on focusing on him she fails to notice the other person sneaking up on her and she knows no more.
Awoken by the rocking of a carriage and a head splitting headache, she tries to remember how she got there, or even her name, but she cannot.

Saved by the attack of a dragon, she wanders into the wilds of Skyrim, naming herself Iriva Mistreaver. After some time and futile efforts to remember who she once was, Iriva stops trying to find answers and starts living a new life, one with a home she built with her own hands and marries a man that doesn't care where she's from or who she was. She even adopts two orphaned children, feeling an odd connection to them. 

For a while, things are good, Iriva goes off on her trips and brings back long forgotten treasure and collects bounties. But a trip to an orphanage stirs an anger in her for reasons she cannot remember...","1375315973"

2. I do but I am not sure if I would enjoy skilling as I used to. Mostly spend my time with friends now.

3. Well I gotta admit I do sometimes but I would rather concentrate on the good things. I feel like I get judged a lot easier when I am Rank 1 but I guess it's part of it.

The chain goes from my PC to 8 Colorpalettes, 4 trackspots, a nucleus, and then the fog machine.  It's address is 101.  What I meant my DMX at 255 was the value that I send to the machine for what is supposed to be 100% output.  Does that make sense?  I wondered if the cable would be a problem, but I was worried that this DMX thing was similar to the Monster Cable hype where you don't really need it.  I think we only run about 150' of cable all together so I was hoping we could get away with using microphone cables.  All of the other fixtures work just fine.","1375315982"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","First, my estimate of a generation or two is likely off. Let me say ""long ago"".

&gt; corroborated by other contemporary accounts.

... which often enough aren't original. I'm not arguing Caesar didn't exist (that'd be bollocks) but that our notion of his existence is based on long chains of first events happening, some being then told and retold before finally being written down, then copied and copied again. It's a far cry from e.g. an experiment to determine the gravitational constant, which anyone can repeat with a bit of effort. But even that requires you to ""rest on the shoulders of giants"" unless you want to work everything out from scratch (only the giants in history are a bit larger and a lot more blurry). That's why relying on history reminds me of hearsay, not because of actual Chinese whispers happening, but because there's no way to find out now if what we deem as authentic is correct, or just internally consistent.

&gt; [...] whose core beliefs rest upon hearsay [...] why should they engage in selective skepticism?

This ignores the rest of us who don't pass on hoaxes, doesn't it? Granted, it doesn't happen that often over here but when it does, there's a reason why I don't share such stuff and it's not laziness or that I couldn't be bothered :).

"AlAnon","t5_2sj6l","Ooo, this is a hard one!  I hope a lot of other people will chime in too with their answers!

I'm not the greatest at boundaries, but one thing I have noticed is that setting boundaries works better when I am more inward focused and carefully examine my own needs, emotions, and desires.  I can't force other people to act a certain way, but I can accept my reactions to their behaviour and find ways to respond that are healthy for me and stay inside my comfort zone.  

One boundary that I have right now is that I'm not going to have casual sex anymore without being in a committed relationship - no more FWB relationships, or sleeping with guys if I know we don't have a future together.  It's an easy one to assert because I'm not focused on making the other person do anything or respond a certain way, I'm just looking after myself and acting in a way that makes me like myself, instead of question what the heck I'm doing all the time.

Another boundary that I asserted once pretty successfully was to give an ultimatum to my husband that I could not live with him while he was continuing to contact and flirt with a girl that he had a crush on.  I stuck to my guns and he moved out.  This was a good boundary because even though I couldn't make him stop being an idiot and doing hurtful things, I did gain some stability and control over my immediate environment - I made the apartment a safe place for me, regardless of the bad stuff that was going on in the bigger situation.  

I also try not to be too dogmatic or black-and-white when setting or asserting boundaries - when I start feeling really forceful or inflexible, it's not a good sign, although they can take courage to assert.  I try to act from a point of inward certainty, to protect myself, rather than from a point of outward pushiness, where I'm trying to get the other person to do what I want.  ""If the other person doesn't agree with me or acts in a way that makes me uncomfortable, what am I or am I not willing to do to look after myself?""  There's a reading about them in one of the daily readers that talks about building fences, not walls - a fence can be taken down or moved around when it's appropriate.

One thing that I struggle with is following through or being consistent with the boundaries.  Early in our marriage, my ex cycled through rush hour traffic in London completely stumbling drunk.  I was really horrified at the time (we had been complete non-drinkers for years at his urging, so the whole thing was super confusing), and apparently told him that our marriage would be over if he binged out like that again.  Unfortunately, I totally forgot about this incident, so of course I didn't follow through the next time he got tanked, which was a couple of years later.  Three years later, he was binging multiple times a week, and drunken cycling accidents etc. were a totally normal part of our existence.  He interpreted my failure to follow through as a weakness, not realizing that I had completely forgotten about the incident.  In hindsight, I overreacted to the one incident and tried to use the ultimatum to make him behave.  I wasn't willing to follow through on my ultimatum later on, and that perceived weakness made it easier for him to ignore, belittle, and continue to push the rest of my personal boundaries in every possible way.  I was also acting like a bully, trying to make him ""behave"" or punishing him for his misdeeds.  I wish I actually had left the next time he got tanked.  :(

Knowing this, I am pretty sparing with the boundaries that I set, and I try to set only the boundaries that I need to have for myself in order to look after myself.  Sometimes it is enough to accept that I can't control the behaviour of others, but I can calmly and politely let them know if my feelings are hurt if they do something unacceptable.  I also get super nervous sometimes when saying ""no"" to people or asserting my personal boundaries.  Sometimes I get carried away and do it in a way that is not very nice.  Hopefully this will get better with practice, because the boundaries that help me look after myself better really feel good to have.

Do you have some Al-Anon literature at home, or could you borrow some from the library?  There is some good information about boundaries if you look in the subject index of some of the books.

Good luck with it!  Please let us know what ends up working in your situation and what doesn't - this is a topic that I think a lot of us struggle with, so we will definifely be able to learn from each other's experiences.","1375315989"

I'll say the first few minutes were 2 quick deaths, 1 from no beads, the other just being over aggressive. 

Overall, it seems nice for quick tanks. The MP5 is great especially with a low mana pool (i can see this being great for a laning ymir). I dont know I'm not that good and definitely don't play herc regularly.. it might need some tweaking but its possible.

As for how deadly a knife can be, even with multiple people drawn down on a person, knives are extremely dangerous in close quarters. A person can be on you faster than you can react - and even if you start popping rounds off it isn't a guarantee that you will stop your target. Bullets hitting the arms, shoulders, and even parts of the legs will not stop someone sprinting at you if they are under the influence of drugs or just have a heavy adrenaline rush.

The leaked info may only be covered for a couple of days to a week before the story is dropped for the latest breaking news, whatever it may be. Suddenly everyone has shrugged the leak off and doesn't give a shit one way or the other about Snowden's whereabouts.

I'd guess a small portion of the public would care enough to find the entire info leak online. Further speculating that a large percentage of this small group would give up due to the volume of info to weed through, not understanding the jargon used or both.

If the above scenario or something similar played out then Snowden would be putting everything on the line for far too few people to do anything about it.","1375315995"

Also you haven't really addressed the point of the OP which was more like ""why is your system any less arbitrary?"" If god wants people to love eachother then why does he want that? Is it because love is intrinsically good in the universe and not dependent on god, or is it because god likes love. If the latter then why? Does god like love because it is intrinsically good or does he like it for no other reason than he likes it. Either way you have to accept that your moral system is just as ""arbitrary"" as ours, or that love is intrinsically good to the universe, which i don't imagine you'll accept because it makes god unneccessary.

windows: wgl,  
X windows: glx,  
apple: cocoa (minimal copy/paste objective c to get a context up with their OpenGL view class).
also you will most likely need to use something like http://glew.sourceforge.net/ to register function pointers for some newer opengl functions most notably the ones used for compiling shaders.   
if you're lazy you could always try GLUT or whats that other newer one called...

OpenAL is pretty straight forward untill you start trying to do complex things like effects, streaming playback, or dynamic audio environments. so you dont really need a library, or you could write one yourself to do simple loading / playback of wav files without much effort going off of tutorials.

option 2 - if you just want to make stuff happen on screen, and through speakers now and dont personally care about how OpenGL or OpenAL operate behind a user friendly layer, or how to do other necessary tasks such as gathering user input, setting up timers, creating and managing sound buffers / sources, etc . something like SDL, would be useful. 

some people will preach not to reinvent the wheel, and some of us believe there is always room for improvement and customization, as not all wheels are ideal for every type of terrain. if you're a beginner you might want to stick with someone elses code just to get the ball rolling and not worry too much about OS the specific stuff, and you will definitely want to use a math library like glm, or http://clb.demon.fi/MathGeoLib/nightly/  ","1375315998"

* Low level players are matched up with other low level players, who will mostly be just as clueless.

* Responding to criticsm positively will in the vast majority of cases stop people from raging at you and reporting you. Don't wait for other people to be nice, be nice first even if you're responding to hostility and you'll be surprised at how many people will turn around their attitude.

* You would have to be *consistently* playing worse than your teammates for it to be an issue, which is unlikely given the first dot point.

It's also worth noting that trains derail on a regular basis and no one is injured. Sure some things get torn up, but generally speaking, it's pretty safe.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Vision Kamado grill, with a full line of accessories (adjustable 2 level spider with drip pan and heat deflector, high quality racks, high quality pizza stone, electronic blower and temp sensor). It's a version of a Big Green Egg, but at about 1/2 to 1/3 the price and IMO a better engineered base unit in a lot of respects. All the BGE accessories work with it, and I got the non-BGE brand versions that are intended to work with a BGE. All in all, it's a BBQ setup that cost me ~$1400. But, I can cook 34hr beef briskets without refuelling, 18hr pulled pork, pizza in 2 min, gorgeous ribs, etc. Theoretically I can my own smoked cheese and even smoke cheese cake! Plus it's a BBQ that should last 20-30+ years.

A full set of Wusthof knives. There are few things as nice as being able to cook with proper knives, ones that take apart foods with almost no effort. Aside from the usual knives (paring, chef's) the fillet knife is a godsend and makes cutting up the costco primal cuts a much easier task. Even went for a set of their non-serrated steak knives! THOSE are expensive. The first time I used them though, I knew it was worth it. No more shredded meat, just nice, perfect cuts.

Bluestar range and Vent-A-Hood range hood. The range is all gas, and has some of the most powerful non-commercial front burners you can get on the market (22K BTU). It's designed for wok cooking, in that you can remove the top of the grill and the wok nestles right on the burner allowing for maximum heat. The range hood is out of this world, and a must have for this kind of stove. It's rated 300 CFM, but pulls 450 CFM realistically. To give you an idea, most hoods for electric stoves pull 100-150 CFM. When I was seasoning my wok with thing drawing at full power you could literally see the column of smoke going up and bending backwards into the hood, it's unreal. And way, way quieter than you'd think! Expensive hoods, but worth it.","1375316013"

So for INTC, the future's definitely going to be dominated by computers, so more computer chips, and INTC is the best in the market. I think of AMD as the cheaper alternative, whoever INTC lefts out, AMD picks up. MSFT is just a safe choice, they won't be gone in the near future and will continue to dominate the computer OS for the ease of use. Chose EA cause I like their games. Picked NOK cause I am confident that their Lumia line will slowly gain momentum on the phone market. The specs aren't bad, in fact, they're top notch quality!

Second, obviously, it's illegal. Doing illegal things is a no no.

Third, it has a lot of long term health issues on teenagers (and adults, but worse on teens). There are things like impaired memory and learning issues, stunted development, reduced fertility, and most importantly **respiratory diseases like lung cancer**. ^[[1]](http://brown.edu/Student_Services/Health_Services/Health_Education/alcohol,_tobacco,_&amp;_other_drugs/marijuana.php)

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;So you are saying they are doomed to work minimum wage jobs their entire lives, no way out, therefore we must force their employers to pay them more than their job is worth? 

Yes. The employers are able to increase the worth of their labor by increasing prices instead of subsidizing their labor through the taxpayers.

&gt;Why not raise it up to $50/hr or $100/hr?

Because that's no economically viable.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","&gt;You make it sound as though all virgins who are over 30 are virgins because they have failed to seduce a woman (or man) and that it wasn't a choice.

Sex is a pretty strong drive for normal people.  If you don't have sex as an adult, you aren't properly socialized or you're asexual.

&gt;Virginity doesn't not automatically equate to introversion, social anxiety, inability to talk to women, etc. 

Barring a medical issue, yes it generally does.

&gt;Sometimes they just don't want to have sex with particular people or don't think of sex as this magical and perfect thing that they must perform/do to be an adult.

This is a rationalization.  There are enough people on the planet you should be able to find *one* with whom to have sex at some point in your first 30 years on the planet.  I never said it was magic or perfect... but it's a natural instinct.

&gt;Also, why does having sex make you more mature than other people in your age group who haven't? 

I didn't say that, precisely.  It's a lack of mature social skills that make you less likely to have a sexual relationship.  'Maturity' can cover a large spectrum of things, and it's possible to be mature in some areas and immature in others.","1375316023"

I got pregnant for the first time at 19, then again at 22, and twice when I was 23. They were all with the same man, and we had been together since we we 14 and 15. The only reason we had not been married is because our first baby was an accident, then we set a date and our losses kept getting in the way. All four of those children I lost after 13 weeks, one I birthed at 20 weeks and got to hold her for only an hour, until she died. 

That man and I split because our depression was a major strain on each other,  and he handled his by becoming an alcoholic. I handled mine by throwing myself into work so I could afford to be on my own, since I pretty much was anyway. 

Then an old friend of mine, that I had known for over 8 years, and I started dating. We got pregnant but I lost the baby very early. We were using protection when we conceived our daughter, who was my first baby to make it to term. We have lost another since she was born, too. 

 I'm so happy that you were super fertile and didn't have to go through as much heartbreak and depression as I did. I'm glad that the decision to have kids early was your life goal, when others picked a different path and have had to deal with the scrutiny of it, and the danger/challenges that comes with having children later in life.

No, having to pay to vote is a poll tax. Requiring proper ID is not.

&gt;Everyone doesn't have to go to the DMV. People who don't drive don't ever go there.

Of course they do. They go to obtain a state ID, which is required to open a bank account, buy alcohol, cash a check, and do numerous other things.

&gt;And when these laws get passed during an election year rather than now like NC is doing, it makes an undue burden.

This isn't an election year. Last year was an election year. This is about as far away from an election as possible. 

&gt;Voter fraud doesn't happen nearly as much as people think.

According to one political faction, the one that stands to benefit most from it. The other political faction disagrees. 

&gt;And anyways, you need voter registration to vote, so that culls fraud pretty well.

How? There are numerous political organizations that devote much time and money to generating bogus registrations. 

&gt;Lastly, voter fraud isn't really occurring (otherwise we'd see a marked difference between votes and polls).

Except it is. That's why people have been caught and convicted of it. The vast majority go undetected though. Also, a large difference between polls and votes isn't necessary to swing an election. Election campaigners already know where races will be tight and a small amount of targeted fraud can be sufficient to swing the results of an election. ","1375316026"

I don't like feeling that I have no choice but to want what I want and fear what I fear. Of course that dislike itself is part of the absurdity as well, I suppose. 

See, I can't escape it. Why are we here and why are we doomed to limitation? If we are an ever increasingly complexity resulting from universal forces and conditions, then we can never transcend our limitations, because we are not in control of ourselves. We are simply playing out the inevitable sequence of events like actors on a stage. 

Is it bad if an actor realizes he's been acting his whole life, and yet, cannot figure out how to stop acting besides stepping off the stage? No method of acting or philosophy of acting can give the actor control over his script. 

Simply resigning to trying to enjoy the stage time as much as possible seems spitefully self-delusory. ","1375316027"

and yes, I agree. Players do report other players if they do too well because they're either mad and are trolling or legitimately think you are cheating. Then again, this system will take into account your total amount of time you are online. Takes into account how many times you are muted, reported for one thing or another, etc.
One bad report out of weeks, months, years worth of playing is going to be nothing. How many people actually go out of their way to report?

Also, this system will force those who do curse and troll to clean up their act or be little shits and play with each other. It'll be hell for them. No one wants to do that. So I expect their to be a better community as well thanks to this new system.

That's just how I see it. I'll have to wait for more info and better details to see exactly how they'll prevent trolls.","1375316029"

I am currently in the process of making a game (something I have always dreamed of) and the Jak and Daxter series is probably one of the main reasons games have always been my passion. The game I'm making is in a similar vein to The Last of Us (and i hate to brag, but I thought of the idea for the game long before TLOU was teased), and it would make me truly happy for the first time in years to know what even one of you guys thing of it. Is there any way I can send you an .exe of what I have so far, just so that you could even play it, let alone give me some feedback? 

I don't want you to give reply with an email address or anything as you would be bombarded by fans, but maybe I could send you a link to download it or something? ","1375316033"

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","I'm aware of this issue. 

* Wargaming compares it some way, and you are forced to accept it. Some spreadsheet told them that 400 credits per gold is balanced between ""spend money"" and ""get upset at ripoff"" - but the actual number ""400"" has little to do with the game.

* I'm writing from -my- perspective, with an average experience per battle at 1000+ this means 50 matches are required without any bonuses. If I platoon consistently my winrate will go from 60% to ~75%. (from my experience tracking session stats). 30 wins was an estimate for the 50K Experience event. You can reduce the number of games to 15 per day and you will still be an order of magnitude away in the result.

* Comparing playing WoT to a Fulltime Job is exactly the 'Apples to Oranges' comparison your mentioned. 

* Paying for a Premium Account is comparable to paying for Credits if one assumes (as I did) an unchanging time-commitment to playing the game. The only possible counter argument is if the credits are considered as an 'extra' (like if I needed them to stock up on ammo, or buy a tier 10 at a discount, etc). 

* The underlying question of my post was how to best spend the money assuming such activity - and my answer is that it's best spent on In-Game purchasing or Gift-Packages that DO NOT include Credits.

That ***400*** is ""the real WTF"" a completely arbitrary number that's at least ***one order of magnitude smaller then it should be***. ","1375316033"

It also explains why it's only Hannibal's workers working on the kaiju carcasses, it makes sense that a black market entrepreneur would keep that secret to himself...and if only one guy knows how to neutralize the stuff then it makes equal sense that the military would rather keep their debt to him at a minimum seeing as once kaiju blood is spilt it's either ""hey let's relocate"" or ""hey let's call Chau"". But again, considering it that deeply is pretty much sheer conjecture :P

"wiiu","t5_2sjnz","&gt;""Nintendo needs to go software only, and get out of the hardware business""

I have never said this. My point is simply that the wii u is currently a dud and it's bringing down the company. Maybe in the grand scheme of things it's a cup of water on the hull of a boat, but maybe it's not. 3ds sales will taper off at some point. There are only so many people who will want one and maybe in a year or 2 the numbers will be pretty low. But 3ds sales are not what is saving the company right now, it's merely a life vest.

I could go on and on on mistakes nintendo has been making and continues to make, but those have been in other threads. Maybe their next system will be on top again, maybe it wont, but it wont change that the wii u is an anchor on their current income statements. 

True that the Xbox lost money on it's hardware.. but it still outsold the gamecube and it had halo to help carry it. The xbox had an xbox game making it tons of money... the wii u has a completely different piece of hardware keeping it afloat. And again, not to go far off topic, but this is one of the wii u's biggest problems. 

&gt;If the planet was on a 1 currency system then i'm sure countless companies would post a loss.

This is a HUGE problem if it's true. I don't know what other companies this would include... but if you are lets say a manufacturing company and you are losing money in your day to day operations but you post a profit bc your country has a weaker currency than countries you are shipping to, then you really shouldn't be in business for long. 

But going way back to the begining.. my statement was that the article that you linked does not mention that the BULK of the income by Nintendo had nothing to do with how they operate or their products, but is based on the fact that when money goes from one country to another, it changes value. Sure the 3ds is doing well on it's own, but the currency exchange is a HUGE detail that cannot be overlooked, and is something that the investors will not overlook and when your investors are scared they start running away and where will Nintendo be then?","1375316042"

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Hmm.  Good points and bad points, which I suppose is inevitable with so much generalization.  Some of the generalizations I'm are not sure I agree with:

1.We all want to be ""Alpha Males"" and
2. One must constantly think about not masturbating if they take up nofap (I would argue that most who are successful do the opposite)

I think you are also somewhat confused by the idea of addiction.  If an alcoholic is drinking because he is ""suffering from depression and anti-social behavior"", usually the first step towards healing is to break (or diminish the strength of) the addiction, which makes him unable to see these deeper issues.  If he can't do this, then it will be very hard for him to examine and work through these other issues.  You can tell him he needs to deal with his depression/anxiety, but as long as he numbs himself with his addiction, he will have a hard time listening.  

I think the same applies for many of us struggling with porn addiction.  That's why the 90 day 'reboot' can be so great.  It allows us to distance ourselves from our addiction, so that we can do all the things you're saying we should be doing instead.  If at the end of the 90 days, one feels like he can use masturbation responsibly (unlike before), well, then he can try to find out.

Lastly, I guess some could fall into the trap of ""unnecessarily labeling themselves an addict"" and feeling sorry for themselves.  However, this has not been the case for me, nor for many others on here.  It is not some kind of a 'blame game'.  It is a realization that, while your brain may be desiring one thing, you have the choice to say no, and to weaken that craving over time. Again, to weaken this craving is to free up mental resources for challenging yourself and trying new things. To me, that is empowering, the opposite of feeling sorry for yourself.","1375316042"

"technology","t5_2qh16","It is meaningless to say ""the pipe is encrypted, not the data that flows through it"". As I already said, there is no pipe that is separate from the encryption. The encryption *is* the pipe. The analogy is that no one can peer into the opaque pipe (i.e. no one can discern what the now encrypted data means). To put it in yet another way, encrypting your data is like putting it inside an opaque pipe as opposed to sending it in the open.

From a technical point of view, a VPN consists of two (or more, but lets simplify) nodes (computers), yours and a remote one. The two nodes arrange a shared secret. There is also an implicit agreement between the nodes that your node will encrypt some data with the shared secret, along with some additional information of where the data is supposed to end up, and send it to the remote node. The remote node then decrypts the data and acts as a proxy: it passes the data it received from your node to the final destination.

It is true that the data travels from the remote node to the final destination without the encryption offered by the VPN. However, you may encrypt the data beforehand and then hand it off to the VPN, encrypting it *again*. This is like having a pipe within a pipe (inside of which is the clear, unencrypted data). This would ensure that, once the remote node removes the outer pipe, there is still an additional pipe underneath (the inner encryption). This is only possible if the final destination knows how to remove the final pipe (decrypt the data).","1375316042"

Any child could see that a week old cut with puss needs to be treated, it's almost instinct. 



I would compare it to a general that sends in 1/4 of his infantry to defend an outpost against impossible odds. Of course he loses all those men. Does that mean it was CLEARLY A MISTAKE? Maybe it seems so at the time, but it doesn't mean it was a mistake. Maybe that general just had knowledge you didn't and this was an unfortunate but necessary part of his strategy.

Maybe he did that to deal a crippling blow to the enemy on another front and win the war altogether.

So maybe, and bare with me on this one because it may be very HARD for you to accept it, but just maybe you have NO IDEA what they do at PGI or why they do it.




So you're going to have to show me the planned development schedule of the whole year from PGI to convince me that what they did isn't just part of the bigger picture and as inconvenient as it is for you that it is necessary for the development of the game.

Now let's be clear, I'm not saying it ISN'T a mistake(It may turn out that it was). I'm just saying that:

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The X-men trilogy, I hated Storm, don't get me wrong I love Halle Barry, but two roles she should have **never** been given, Catwoman and Storm. Storm is a powerful, nature loving, zealous woman with wrath that no one dared to challenge. Halle Barry just didn't present any kind of strong personality for it, and didn't feel like the character. They honestly only gave it to her because she was a big name.

Now if they wanted an actor that had the features and the attitude to best represent storm, I would of without a doubt picked Angela Bassett. There is no angrier woman in the world that compares to the presence she carries on film. Watch her in Waiting to exhale after she lights her husbands car on fire, you'll see the damn there identical sway as the comic book, cartoon storm. 

[The last woman on earth you want to piss off](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGwV4mrOCJo)

Give Angela Basset Storm's mutant powers and they'll have to reclassify X-men as a horror film.

Another person I would of preferred over Halle Barry, Whitney Houston. If she was focused on the role and simply came as herself. That's a strong voice, and a strong presence that would have shook the earth. ","1375316049"

The reason Royal Decree isn't broken in this aspect is because traps have to wait a turn to go off. Spellbooks wouldn't even be tier 10 if they were all traps.

The only way around this is to give it a limitation on WHEN it can be activated. Look at ""Bujin Regalia - The Mirror"" to see how it is a balanced version of Cold Wave for Bujins.

The one you usually hear on TV tends to be a Glaswegian accent, but there's plenty of others; Aberdonian -  my own accent -, Doric (or ""tcheuchter"" if you're from the sticks in Aberdeenshire), Invernesian, Orcadian, Dundonian, etc. 

If you heard an accent from Scotland I doubt you'd call it a British accent, you'd probably call it a Scottish accent. ","1375316063"

For Disney's part... well, that exploitable, family-friendly IP is the entire reason they purchased Marvel. Neither of them feels like sharing.

Disney and WB are massive media conglomerates that view comics as a division of the business that generates IP and fans of said IP for them to otherwise exploit. From the perspective of their corporate masters, neither Marvel or DC are comicbook companies, they're IP mines... and because of that they can no longer do normal comic industry things like cross-company crossovers.","1375316067"

"MAME","t5_2rbl1","I had an X-Arcade tankstick for a while. They use Happ clones, so genuine Happ parts will drop in. I don't recall those having restrictor plates, or even having restrictor plates being sold. 

Story Time: the PCB on my X-Arcade crapped out on me (would freeze, buttons wouldn't register, sometimes hitting too many buttons made the thing not work at all) so I moved on to greener pastures with Hori and Madcatz controllers.. a friend of mine saw the tankstick and HAD to have it. It was so bad, I couldn't even give it away to him. I ended up replacing the PCB with an Ultimarc IPAC and it's been working like a dream ever since. He's certainly happy with it.

Also, if the form factor isn't an issue for you - A lot of people get hung up on doubles controllers with that squashed pentagon shape, battops, and concave buttons - you may want to consider getting something like a Madcatz fightstick. When they go on sale on Amazon and Newegg they can get as cheap as $70. You definitely get more bang for your buck out of those when you consider the quality of the parts.","1375316067"

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","&gt; Am I missing something? The post here on reddit says ""Torah M'Sinai"", the RCA's post says ""Torah Min HaShamayim"". Is there a difference?

Torah Min Hashamayim is the actual term used by Chazal and the Rishonim (including the Rambam in his Introduction to the Chelek). The term Torah Mi Sinai has been used colloquially by many in reference to the specific use of Torah Min Hashamayim by the Rambam in the 8th Ikar of Emunah. By using this phrase, you no longer allow for the range of interpretation that classic Rishonim and Acharonim were willing to accept (like the Ibn Ezra), or for the alternative read in the Gemara (Bava Batra 15a). 

Now, while I personally believe as the Rambam, anyone who would adopt a position like that of the other position in the Gemara or that of Ibn Ezra (that Joshua wrote the last 8-12 passukim or Torah and not Moshe), or who would wish to understand that the Torah was communicated to Moshe over the span of time between Sinai and Choreiv, etc, should not be labeled a Heretic, simply not normative for what has been accepted by the bulk of the Orthodox world today.

That said, I don't believe R' Farber's stated views are within the boundary of Torah Min HaShamayim as previously understood by any authority. As such, he may very well be a technical apikores who's views place him outside of traditional Orthodoxy. This doesn't detract from the fact that he is still a well respected friend and scholar. But one who'd views I cannot lump together with my own, much like Heshel, or Mendalson, or other great minds and Jewish figures who's views took them outside of Orthodoxy, but who's challenges when dealt with honestly, critically, and respectfully, have ultimately strengthened the Jewish community including Orthodoxy.

"running","t5_2qlit","I am a D2 XC/TF assistant coach and work a lot with recruiting so I may be able to help. 
To get a full-ride at a competitive D1 program (University of Oregon for example) his 800 would likely have to be below 1:52. Lots of people can go to D1 schools to run but if he wants to really go to a successful program to focus on the 800 (most 800 runners have a harder time transitioning to help in XC so they aren't always as valuable to a team as a miler or 5k runner...generalizing here, but true in majority of cases), he certainly will need a very positive attitude, consistent times his senior year, and to be able to show room for improvement.

The easiest way to contact most programs is to check their team's websites. Many will have ""prospective athlete profiles"" you can fill out and submit, although most coaches will not spend a lot of time talking to him until the end of his junior year. NCAA has many recruiting rules to stop recruitment from seriously happening before that.

ALSO, coaches can have sway with the admissions process to some extent. They can waive application fees and things like that at most universities (I do not know as much about D3 or NAIA schools). Just make sure he continues to work on his running form and relaxing his face when he thinks he is running hard. One of the biggest issues high school athletes face is over-straining when they run to the point of it hindering them a great deal. 

Best of luck to you and your son. Sounds like you are doing everything possible to help him succeed.","1375316071"

As for your last point, thank you very, very much for the reminder. He loves to run, he loves that it's something he's good at. He's been through way too much in his short life, and running has been his oasis since he was was about 11 years old. It's so easy to push too hard. Believe me, it's a struggle internally. I try to push, tell him to have fun, and just support him.

&gt;Why should [public school] students be charged for food? Should we also charge them for using a chair? How much does it cost to license a chair for a year? $10? What about textbooks? What about printer toner? Library fee? Computer fee? Membership fee? How about we charge per class to compensate teachers?
&gt;
&gt;It's a fucking socialized education system. It's provided free of charge, to provide people with a guaranteed basic level of education and to promote individual and community betterment. It's not about money, and charging for anything like this is completely fucked. Especially charging for food. Shit, in some districts food is profitable. WHY THE FUCK IS ANYTHING PROFITABLE? The whole operation is a sunk cost, and it's morally fucked to try to balance the books like this.
&gt;
&gt;Being adequately fed is a critical component to not only learning (which is the whole point, right?), but also healthy physical development. And, as far as I can see, charging anything for the complete shit available in public schools does nobody any good whatsoever. In fact, I'll argue that it has a not insubstantial negative impact on poor students.
&gt;
&gt;It is my opinion that public schools should provide students with actually healthful and adequate food at no charge. Don't make it gourmet, don't even try to make it appear fancy or interesting, just make it tasty and make a lot of it. People who can afford to will choose to eat by other means, for variety and just to be different. People who can't will be provided with something decent, so that their education is not negatively impacted by poor nutrition.
&gt;
&gt;And for fuck's sake, don't let administrators somewhere choose the food. Or, if you do, put it in their contract that they must eat a minimum number of meals a week there. And hire real people to make real food. I swear, there is no excuse for buying commodity freeze dried crap or whatever they do from some huge supplier.","1375316075"

**Torreto**: Quality entertainment here.

**Bliss**: Well...?

Torreto looks at Bliss. She flutters her eyelashes and looks at Michael and then at the teacups. Torreto rolls his eyes. He then bows slightly*

**Torreto**: After you, Lady Bliss. 

Rachel attempts to walk in through the front gate but it's locked. Torreto jumps up on the gate and begins climbing. He signals Bliss to follow.

**Bliss**: I cant climb that! I'm wearing a skirt!

**Remy**: (Yelling from the teacups) AINT GOTTA WORRY ABOUT EXPOSING YOURSELF RACHEL!

**Bliss**: What did he say?

*Torreto hops down and if forced to assist Rachel up and over. They link hands and take the teacup beside Remy.*

**Bliss**: No! I want the pink one!

*Torreto rolls his eyes as his fiancee drags him across the ride into a pink tea cup*

**Remy**: PINK LOOKS GOOD ON YOU BUDDY! 

The music and the ride stops. All the lights go out. The only thing lighting the area is the moonlight. Bliss whispers to Mike but he disregards her. He looks around a little scared. He yells at Remy as quiet as possible

**Torreto**: Nice going, Remy! 

*Next thing they know Remy is curled up in a ball in their tea cup. He rocks back and forth.*

**Remy**: I can't go to jail man.

**Torreto**: What about living a little?

**Remy**: EXACTLY! I WANNA LIVE MAN! 

**Guard**: HEY!

*The gang turn their heads to see a security guard at the other side of the fence. They all hop out of the tea cups and make their way out. The guard chases them through the vastness of Disney Land*

**Bliss**: Wow this place is big! It seems a lot smaller during the day.

**Remy**: That's because we're not being pushed and shoved every five seconds.

**Torreto**: I hate to say it, I'd much rather be pushed than chased.

*Remy shoves Torreto as a joke. Accidently Torreto bumps into Rachel. Bliss falls to the ground and rolls on the pavement. Her shirt straps are ripped and her lip is cut open. Her chest exposed. Remy's eyes widen. He then feels a slap in the back of his head*

**Torreto**: Dude! 

**Remy**: What!? It's not like I couldn't see them before!

**Torreto**: THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! WHY DID YOU SHOVE ME!

**Bliss**: See what?

*A flashlight shines on the wall about 500 feet away. The three freak out. Remy freaks out. He runs to a near by shop and tries to kick the door down. It turns out the door is a push door and it wasn't locked. That doesn't stop Remy from boasting. Torreto and Bliss follow inside.*

*They hide behind the cash register counter and watch as the guard goes by.* 

**Remy**: That was close.

**Bliss**: Too close. What's wrong with you Remy!? I didn't sign up for this. 

**Torreto**: We're gonna have to find our way back to SplashMountain. I gotta get my computer back. I'm not buying ANOTHER one. 

**Remy**: Shit dude... I'll by you one!

**Torreto**: ... fine. We gotta think of a way out. We can't just walk out the front door.

**Bliss**: Why?

**Remy**: No way we're getting out. Way too secure. It's Disney Land for Godsake.

**Bliss**: Exactly! It's DisneyLand! Not a bank.

**Remy**: C'mon Rach... you don't think they have this place armed and guarded? They're hiding their leader here.

**Torreto**:(laughing) Walt Disney?

**Remy**: Yea... that guy. Legend has it he's under Disney Land... frozen. 

**Bliss**: Well let's find him.

**Remy and Torreto in unison**: What!?!?

**Bliss**: I'd love to meet him! Think about it... this man knows what a lady is and should be. The dude is old school. He's my kinda guy.

**Torreto**: I'm not gonna have my fiancee stolen by a frozen man.

**Bliss**: Calm down! Come on... exactly like Remy said... it's time to live. Okay so maybe we had a little scare just now... but that's understandable.

*Remy is looking around the shop. He holds a ladies shirt in his hands with the words  ""Happiest Place on Earth"" on the chest. He giggles at the placement. He then turns around. He debates whether or not to give it to Rachel who is in need of a new top*","1375316075"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Hi, Neil. Hi, Bruce. I, like everyone else here, am a huge fan of your work, and especially The Last Of Us. I did not think I would play a game that could appeal to me at the same level as the MGS games did, both story- and gameplay-wise, but you guys did it somehow! I'd like to thank you for making a game that we as gamers can be proud of, a game that truly makes the best out of everything the medium has to offer, and is both emotionally gripping and extremely entertaining. With all that said, I have a question I want to ask you.

One of my favorite things about the game is how so much of the story is open to the viewer's interpretation. What's/who's right or wrong, how different parts of the story unfolded and so forth. Watching someone else is almost as entertaining as playing yourself, just to see how different people react to the same situations and how they choose to solve said situation.

With that in mind, where there instances in developing where the different members of the creative team really disagreed with eachother? Did you guys all have your own visions of what the story and game should look like, or was it more commonly agreed upon? If so, what parts of the game were there most friction/disagreement between the members? Where there parts of the game that some of the creators weren't satisfied with how turned out?","1375316077"

"China","t5_2qh2v","I'm also going to disagree here. I don't very much like Taiwan at all. I have to kind of side with the whole Chinese reunification thing, but I'm not sure if I want to ""reunify"" with them. I suppose they're...useful to trade with and stuff...so I guess the status quo is okay.

Taiwan seems too hedonistic, individualistic, and provincial to me. I get this feeling that Taiwanese try to reject the heritage of Chinese civilization and try to focus on local culture - but there's not a very long local history, so they end up having nothing. In most cases when they take influences from places like Japan, they seem like pretty subpar copies. 

Literally everything I find uncomfortable about Japan is duplicated in Taiwan, with few of the things I find refreshing present. As such, I actually vastly prefer Japanese culture over Taiwanese culture. 

On the same point, I think this does kind of make them very Chinese. A lot of the problems I find with modern Mainland Chinese culture are also heavily intensified in Taiwan. I actually think these are related. Both Taiwan and Mainland China are heavily influenced by the culture and ideology of Imperial Japan - Taiwan moreso than the Mainland. However, it seems both are heavily pursuing that angle while the mainland follows a little behind - while Japan itself kind of realized that that whole path was a bad idea. ","1375316078"

If you are serious about marrying your fiance and becoming step mommy, you've got to come to some kind of understanding with the mother of the kid. Part of accepting the role to help raise a child is putting aside your own feelings for the sake of said child. What would happen if for some reason your fiance wasn't able to communicate issues involving the kid? It would be your responsibility to step in and fill that role. You can hate her guts as much as you want (I fucking hate my step daughters mother), but when it comes to issues like that, you have to be able to put everything aside.

As someone who is looking into Orthodoxy myself, I am focusing more initially on the theology and the Church to see if it is something I feel comfortable accepting.

"martialarts","t5_2qkt4","The problem with martial arts, and anything in general is that there is a population average. There will be people at the low end of the curve, the average joes, and the elites. When you look at the evolution of MMA as a sport alone, it is now coming up into its third generation. Royce, Kimo, Ken, these guys were essentially great at one base style that competed at unified rules eventually. I would say the Glory days of Pride brought about a second group of fighters. More informed folk who mixed things up a little more, People who specialized, but were also okay at other things. Also I would consider this the generation that learned to fight with the rules. The ground and pound fighters like matt hughes, and tito wouldn't have been as great as they were in their prime had there been different rules. The newest breed now, Jose aldo, Chang sung jung, Jones, Anthony Pettis, are guys who have more than one base style, but also have mma specific training on top of what they do. And you can really see the difference in methodologies and how pliable this new group of guys are by comparison to Royce in his prime. 

I make that point about different skill sets and different generations because each martial art that is practiced is in a different generation of itself. If you consider mas oyama as the first generation of Kyokushin, along with his thousands of students, where in terms of generation are they at now? When the system got big, they were sacred cows. If you knew karate twenty years ago you were a bad mofo, that isnt the case anymore. What most likely happened was that the guys that stuck with it, who were at the lower end of the spectrum also went on to teach karate, and the quality diluted for the sake of business. This will happen with bjj, and mma as a system. I have no doubt of it. And once the first generation of bjj and mma guys get older and a new perspective is presented to the world in terms of practice I think it would just repeat itself. Where you wonder if having a more open perspective will allow students to think more openly, or whether or not the pool just ends up at this sad average that the great ones just cant look on with joy.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","First of all you should have your bare basics in jungle knowledge, which are runes/masteries and jungle route.

For runes you want Armor seals 100% of the time. You also probably want Attack Speed marks. For glyphs you can bring Scaling MR or Scaling AP depending on your champion and for Quints you can bring Armor pen (Bring 1 armor pen mark along with 3 armor pen quints for max armor pen on jungle creeps), Ability power, or Movement speed. I use armor pen for AD, AP for AP and Movement speed for tanks who's damage doesn't really matter much (Nautilus for example).

Now that runes are out of the way, let's talk masteries:

You typically want 21/9/0 if you're planning on building damage items, taking either the AP or AD masteries in offense and defense vs jungle creeps in the defense tree. (Usually assassin/carry/ap junglers)

For people building tank that also want to do a bit of damage, I suggest a 9/21/0 mastery, taking either armor or magic pen from offense and tank masteries (getting things like armor or less monster damage especially). (Example: Sejuani, Volibear, Hecarim, etc. People that do damage but don't build damage).

For people that don't really do damage and are just walking CC monsters, use 0/21/9 masteries for more buff duration and movespeed and fun stuff like that. (This would be people like Nunu, Nautilus, Nasus, etc.)

Now let's discuss jungle routes. 

You can either smite your first buff (gank at level 4) or smite your 2nd buff (Gank at level 3)

Smiting your first buff, while generally considered to be not as great, is good for junglers who need to quickly farm to 6 (Warwick, Skarner, etc) or when the enemy team is very close to you and you fear they will try to steal your buff over the wall with a skillshot. For this route you want to generally start blue buff if you are a mana using champion (manaless champions can do either). Then go to either wraiths or wolves (Which ever is closer), then do the other camp, then go to your 2nd buff. You can then continue to farm, doing Golems/whatever spawns or you can gank with level 4.

Smiting your 2nd buff (Smiteless first buff) is generally considered the best option, because you can get level 3 before the laners get level 2 and gank extremely early with double buff. For this start make sure you have a strong leash and start at whatever  buff is on the opposite side of the map that you intend to gank at level 3. Whatever buff you start is unimportant, as you will have both very quickly. So if you're blue side and you want to gank top first to snowball your top laner with first blood, start red. Then run directly to the 2nd buff, kill it with smite, and go gank.

Once you have this basic knowledge, the first important skill to master is clearing itself. This is a very easy skill but can be hard for beginner junglers. Make sure that you are able to maintain high enough health to gank, clear quickly and move to camps efficiently. 

I would say the next skill that you need to master is ganking. This is a very complex skill and essentially has no skill cap. You can always improve on your ganking because it involves outplaying your opponent. But there are a few basic ganks

1. Coming from behind where they are. For example, their bot lane is pushed to the middle of the lane. (You are on blue side). you go through their tribush (Ping for your laners) and run past the turret to gank. This gank is very hard to avoid if they don't have it warded because you come FROM their escape route. It is risky, however, because you take turret damage and have lower health.

2. Coming from the middle of the lane. This is the safest option because you don't waste very much time and you don't take turret damage. However, this is also where people ward the most. Make sure to pay attention to enemy ward counts in their items and when they push past the middle just run behind them and kill them. Usually you want to save gap closers for after they flash to guarantee a kill. For example, If im playing Nautilus and ganking top lane I will run past river push and go auto attack/E their laner to snare and then slow them. When they flash I will Q them back into me for an easy level 3 kill.

3. Lane ganks. These are great for when your team pushes into their turret. If minions are past your lane bush (They have to be clear of the bush on your side as well as the middle. Use the end of the enemy bush as line they have to be behind so they dont see you), just run through your lane from behind your tower into the bush. People don't frequently ward lane bushes (Especially in top lane. Sometimes bot lane will.) and wait for the enemy to push or facecheck and surprise jump on them.

Those are just 3 basic examples and obviously there are many many different ways to gank. But this is a good guideline.

Next comes objective pressure and warding. These really go hand in hand. You have the most map presence of all rooles so you have the easiest time warding the entire map. Ward for your laners if they forget, ward your jungle if youre getting counter jungled, ward their buffs if you want to steal them, etc etc. Also, picking up an early oracles is pretty ridiculous for snowballing a lane (Especially with oracles buff). Just run into a lane (especially bot) and clear out all the wards until they run out, forcing them to back or die to your ganks. It's great. But wards in general are very important. When you have wards, you can see if the enemy team is out of position to contest objective and then you can take them. If you have a successful gank, take a tower. If their jungler is top, take dragon (no chance to contest when you have smite and they don't).

Besides that, junglers really don't play much different from laners past laning phase. The only thing is that you have to make sure you're always there for baron/dragon kills and work on your smite skills.

But for early game, just master those basic mechanics and work on always getting your fundamentals better. Then the rest of just game-sense. A very important one is knowing where to be and when. Another important thing is knowing how to balance farming to stay caught up and ganking for map pressure. Practice makes perfect and just make sure you can use your skills you've practiced to make as best of an impact on the game as you can (Which differs every game).

Edit: just to clarify. This is not a checklist, but rather an ongoing list of things to improve on. It would be unwise to say ""I know how to gank now. Time to move on."" There is always a better way to do everything, even for pros.","1375316087"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Okay. So I'll start of by saying that Krauss' conception of ""nothing"" can be defined however he wants to, as long he as accepts (and he does) that it has no relevance to the philosophical conception of ""nothing"", which is the whole issue that he fails to realize/accept. It is interesting from a scientific viewpoint on what preceded the Big Bang, but that's quite different from a universe coming out of nothing in the philosophical sense.

I'll go on to address your post though.

&gt; Classical Theism is itself an assertion, and one that is not used in science.

So?

&gt; If by reject you mean ""claim that it is impossible"", then no, you can't ""reject"" gods as an explanation, nor do we. 

This is fine and is what I feel is the intellectually honest thing to do, it's just that you said the opposite before, that scientists reject God as a possibility. But I see we're on the same page.

&gt;  The idea that this is not ""true""nothing has a major flaw with it. The idea that ""something cannot come from nothing"" is not necessarily proven to be true of the kind of nothing you refer to. That kind of nothing has not actually been observed or tested anywhere in any way ever. It's somewhat of a non-sensical concept, and one that we really can't assert anything about.

It's not so much a ""true"" nothing as ""nothing"" in the philosophical and relevant concept. You actually are arguing my point here; I don't believe nothing (the philosophical concept) existed or exists either - the point is that it's logically impossible for the universe to come from ""nothing"" in this sense. And such is a major problem with atheism, since the atheist needs to claim that the universe has *always* existed in order to escape the problem of claiming it has come from nothing.

&gt; You haven't made any criticisms of his actual claims, just essentially of the idea that ""something cannot come from nothing"", which you claim to be a scientific rule when it is really just ""common sense"" (which usually fails us long before reaching that point in the study of physics)

Show me where I have claimed this to be a scientific rule.

Your TL;DR is fairly interesting. You seem to believe there *was* a beginning of the universe. On your worldview, how do you account for it coming *into* existence which would allow yours to be a rational position?

It seems, from my point of view, you're borrowing a line from Krauss and trying your hardest to outrun the philosophical concept of nothing, which is simply incoherent.

Either the universe has always existed, or it began to exist. You say it began to exist. How is this possible on atheism?

&gt; Just because something was not ""caused"" by something else does not necessarily mean that it is eternal.

That's like saying ""just because something was not caused does not necessarily mean it was uncaused"". It's contradictory and therefore logically impossible. As science is predicated upon philosophy and logic I'd say that's a fairly decent reason to assume you're wrong here.

&gt; Even if you prove that something not eternal (necessary) must have been caused, that still does not mean that God is the only possible cause.

I haven't even argued anything about that yet. I'm asking you, on your worldview, how you believe it was possible for the universe to begin to exist without it having been caused.

&gt; Just because we have not proven that the universe is not ""necessary"" or eternal does not mean that we can't still claim it to be a possibility. 

Your talk of proof leads me to believe that you think we're still talking of science. Science has no domain here as it is just the study of the physical universe. How would it be able to explain how the physical universe came into existence? Any ""evidence"" science could produce would be self-refuting, as it would be physical evidence. That's a bit like appealing to the world around us to prove that the external world around us exists.

&gt; We don't need to explain absolutely everything about cosmology in order to assert that the explanation is possible, so long as it's not proven to be impossible, and it has merit.

Sure. Now show how it's possible without being logically contradictory.

&gt; Even if there is no good secular explanation for something that we are aware of, that does not make the God thing true by default without a good reason to believe it. (argument from ignorance)

Is this a concession that you don't know how it's logically possible that the universe came into existence? I'd say that the notion that ""the universe coming into existence on its own"" being logically contradictory is good enough reason to not hold to it. And this is certainly not an argument from ignorance despite your assertion - you have to do more work than that than simply asserting this to be an argument from ignorance.

But then again I'm going to stress that I'm not arguing for God's existence at this point. You should however 1) quote me where I claimed the concept of ""something coming from nothing"" to be a scientific rule and 2) show me how ""the universe coming into existence uncaused"" is a logically coherent concept.

You should note that I find 1) more pressing that you address than 2), as I won't respond to you further until you address 1). I don't take uncharitibility lightly - I think it's pretty good evidence of anti-intellectualism.","1375316091"

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","One thing that I found helpful when I first started trying to really read films as best as I could was to treat each image like it is being described in a novel. There were films I had read as described as ""rich"" but I didn't really see it when I watched them. But when I started to treat each image like it was being described I definitely started to appreciate what was being communicated. It sounds a bit simple but it definitely helped me learn what each element of the film was doing and what it was communicating by doing so. There are classic novels of not much happening or the story is straight-forward, what's so special about them is how it is told. Films tell us so much with everything we see, from the way people are lit to how they are standing or whatever we are told so much. If you see a shot and then imagine someone was describing it to you it could make up a paragraph telling you things beyond just the story. With novels there is not really a passive way to read them because you have to be engaged enough to appreciate it but with films one can be passive. When we really actively engage with a film by reading each images camerawork, lighting, framing and everything else we can get closer to understanding them. There are so many films that rely on an active viewer to be really enjoyed. 

Another thing is to really think about what each film is trying when evaluating it. Sometimes I see people criticise films about things they're not even trying to do it really bothers me. 

And, just watch as many different films as possible. I'd also suggest stuff like podcasts and reading lots of criticism. Seeing films from other peoples perspectives, even when we don't agree, can help us understand our own taste as well as learn. ","1375316098"

However, don't take a beard trimmer to it, like some may suggest. If the trimmer grips ('bites') and nicks your sack, you **will** cry.


Use some hair conditioner and a nice clean NEW razor. Not a disposable one. A good one in a package from the supermarket for $6-$15 (not sure how cheap they are in America, but I pay $15 for mine). You treat it like your face. Stretch the skin with your fingers, and take it slow. Your sack is a lot more resilient to razor blades than you are probably thinking, but still be careful with it.


I shave both my face and my nether regions as often as each other (half chinese, so my facial hair grows in slow [once a week]), and can honestly say I've nicked my face more than I have my pubic region - which I've only nicked once, and it was with a beard trimmer. Never a razor.


Good luck with the shave, and the surgery, sir.","1375316102"

Well, I have yet to have anyone logically convince me otherwise. The point of a discussion or a debate is to show your knowledge and try to sway your opposition to your own point of view. It's not so different from an military engagement except your positioning is set by history, knowledge, and understanding. Your weapons are semantics, passion, and facts. I have had my mind changed many times on reddit when confronted by a user who knows more about a topic than I do or speaks his position eloquently......and I absolutely love it when that happens because it means I learned something that day and grew a little intellectually or philosophically.

&gt;Have you served on the front lines of any combat zone? And I like the fact that you assume we have personally killed thousand of people. We don't just see someone walking and then shoot at them, We shoot at the guys that shoot at us.

I would never serve. How many wars since WWII have actually been fought by Americans to protect American citizens? If we were being invaded, I would absolutely pick up a weapon and defend my family. We, however, have never been invaded. And no, I don't think any one of you has killed thousands. Collectively, however, you've killed thousands who were trying to kill you after you invaded their homeland and thousands who were not. We were not invaded. We are the invaders who then say that some of those shooting at us deserve death for doing exactly what I would have done: picked up a weapon to defend their home and family.

&gt;You're putting a man down because of a family picture and a uniform he's wearing. I REALLY wish people that have your view point would serve and then see how they feel about things.

No, I'm asking him and other who would follow him to re-evaluate their choices and decisions. I don't hate him. I don't think he is a bad person. I don't know if he is misguided or truly believes in what he chose but I would hope that anyone who chooses a military career would seriously consider whether or not they believe that we should be in Afghanistan and why we should or shouldn't be killing it's people.

I do not support his decisions. I do not think he and others like him are making me safer at this time. And I do not think that invading another country just to get at a few assholes who hate us was a good decision. He should know that some people here don't like what we are doing over there and he should know that some of us think it was his (among others') decision to enlist which allowed our whole military agenda to evolve into what it is today.

Do you actually get additional minerals through mules? As far as I know, you only mine faster. I don't understand why people worry so much about scans ""costing money""... It doesn't matter if you scan or mule, as long as you mine out that base.

obviously you don't get additional minerals through minerals lol. you think mules create minerals out of thin air.

not really that doesn't follow my logic at all because if you never stop making workers you won't have any supply for army, which is what wins the game. my statement was that additional immediate income generates more money to make more production which translates into more units. you actually pretty much never stop making scvs until 70-75 (that's close to your stated 80 number) or so as terran and max out and starting banking at which point you can throw away your workers. this is precipitated on the fact that you have enough OC's to land a lot of mules though. 

making more workers only increases your immediate income, the same way that mules do. except mules use energy and increase your income by a lot more than a scv, they're identical mathematically except the MULES don't suffer diminishing returns (so the constant would be different).

The act was repealed because ""sophisticated financial instruments and policies"" were supposed to prevent the same thing from happening again, and the act prevented corporations from merging and consolidating their operations.

These organisations leveraged their holdings at 30 times the amount they held or 40 times the amount they held, used credit default swaps as insurance on those loans (but it was not regulated the way insurance was regulated) and created sophisticated financial instruments that were used to hide the fact that the instruments were entirely garbage.

The loans could not be repaid, they defaulted, the credit default swaps were called in, they couldn't all be paid because the holders had sold away their obligations on the credit default swaps, often to a long chain of re buyers, who could not be located to pay or who themselves defaulted, the large corporations couldn't pay their obligations and defaulted, and forty percent of the world's wealth - much of which was people's savings and retirements - disappeared.

Basically, it's a putty, comes in ... err, five colors, I think, and I think 2 or 3 different sizes; I use the one-ounce size, about the size of a packet of soy sauce like you get at the sushi bar.  You open the packet, mold it to your needs, let it harden overnight and it becomes a permanent fix.

It's designed to be a permanent fix-er.  So, rechargers for phone and laptops, when it only charges when the cable is held *just so* because the cable starts fraying just at the connector and you think you'll have to get a new one?  Set things up so your phone/laptop is being charged (so you know that the wires are touching), mold some sugru around the connection, let it set -- permanent fix!  Or the handle broke off my favorite coffee mug, and neither regular nor ceramic glue was working.  I put the handle back on, molded some sugru around the break, let it set -- permanent fix!  The arm broke off my glasses and neither tape nor glue kept it in place -- permanent fix!

You can also use Sugru just as hardening putty -- I have a friend who's been using leftover bits to make little half-inch-tall Daleks.  You can mix the colors you can buy to make other colors, and there's at least one person who got that glow-in-the-dark powder and mixed it in for things he tends to use at night.  It's not the perfect fix for every situation, but it's definitely on my go-to list of tools.","1375316112"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","Okay - now the science...
Can science ‘prove’ everything happened in a certain way? Absolutely not – that will never ever happen.  In order for it to happen we would have to create mini universes in a repeatable fashion and be able to manipulate the fundamental building blocks of EVERYTHING.
First let me give a few paragraphs of background information with some history as to how a lot of this came about and the mechanics behind the real reasoning:
String theory came about like 40 years I think.  It originated a long time ago with Einstein if I am not mistaken.  Basically he was trying to get the math to work for his theories, and it worked – sometimes, but not for everything.    He would theorize that there were 3 dimensions – the 3 dimensions we think of, and the math simply would not work.  Finally he added a dimension and said well… time is a dimension!  His math started working and basically most everything he has ever written has been mathematically proven.  Now – you can say its not ‘proved’ but I am using theory and math here.  It’s kind of like 2+2=4  its proven, it works… that’s math we can understand.  
I CANNOT understand the math they are using its way over my head but I can explain the premise behind it.  Basically they added more and more formulas and the math was in theory correct but it would simply not work with 4 dimensions, so they started adding more and more and more… and they ended up with… 11 dimensions.  There are a number of parallels in what I am about to say which I find interesting and I do a fair amount of thinking on these next points.  4 dimensions as we know it plus 7 more (7 levels of hell?  Different dimensions? Can we really have some truth in fairy tales?)  Anyway so all the math started working with 11 dimensions – like down to the absolute T.
One day they finally started saying – well wait a minute… everything works out just so – except NOTHING HAS MASS… nothing has weight!  How?!  Well – that’s how the higgs boson came into play – the whole reason they are doing all these supercollider experiments is to prove how things work on a dimension level – proving that these 7 dimensions exist.  Basically they are saying that the dimensions as theorized exist but unless they find this one particle that grants mass (in some way) people will never be satisfied. 
What they are searching for in these experiments is a loss of energy.  Its mathematically proven that if you insert 10000 units of energy, 10000 units of energy has to come out – well the 10000 units will go different places… kinetic energy, heat, light, etc…  well this is energy transference.  What they are testing is when a particle that has X units of energy actually loses that energy at some point during the collision they are creating (that’s why they need to amp up the energy and the power – so they can truly see/measure that loss of energy, or to be more specific – transference of energy.  Well they are testing to see if one particle in particular will lose energy when you smash these together – that will prove that it is moving from 1 dimension into the next.
What is an example of a dimension?  Gravity! You can think of gravity as both a particle and a flat plane – it is really complex on how the dimensional math works (youtube a couple videos because it’s easy with a diagram – hard with words – unless you are a physicist).  
Now – let’s get to the meat of the science (you will probably need to read this post 5-6 times for it to make sense):
There is a crazy amount of ‘randomness’ In the world, which has to be attributed to just that… randomness.  The whole concept of string theory is that there are particles which are so crazy small there are billions and billions and billions of them on the head of a pin.  These particles are basically circular vibrating strings – all of these strings vibrate at a specific frequency… ALL OF THEM.  How crazy is that and why does that happen.  That is basically the ‘constant’ of our universe.  Thing behave in JUST the right way because everything of this frequency.  Okay – yes I know I hear the detractors now saying “prove it” the crux of it is, I cant nor do I care to get into a debate with you.  Each of these circular strings makes up everything that we know… if this frequency changes – nothing is the same.
You can THEORIZE (and again we start going a billion levels deep here) that there were an infinite number of universes created with an infinite number of different vibrating frequencies with 1 frequency per universe.  Each universe exists for N number of measurable units of time.  It just so happens that each frequency is more or less stable.  And the crazy thing is, the math of everything and how things work and why will be different BASED ON THE FREQUENCY THAT YOUR UNIVERSE OPERATES.  Which means that there will be an infinitely large number of unstable universes being created or destroyed at any point in time, only the stable ones will exist.  
Kind of the whole theory on how many planets we have and how we came to be in JUST the right way on JUST the right planet with JUST the right temperature and water, etc…  That’s why there’s not life on every planet.  The math would simply be different, and it would not work… in other universes im sure there would be a ton of life on a Saturn/Jupiter like planet because the math would be more favorable to that kind of life.
So – now to the ultimate ‘why’ and ‘how’ The big bang… how can this be why can this be.  How could it  explode and then contract in itself.  Well basically think about an explosion under water  what happens?  Well you see things get rushed out in a HUGE HUGE explosion, and it creates a vacuum – and then all of a sudden it starts to collapse in on itself, until it settles back in.  We see ‘big bangs’ here all the time, we just don’t equate them to the big bang.  Think that one nuclear test I the pacific under water where you have this absurd explosion and then a mushroom cloud.
Having some sort of catalyst (no idea what – I wont even venture a guess) would trigger an explosion which is taking a VERY long time to get to the final phases of expanding, and then it will start retracting.  Once we fully retract I do not think we will have another big bang.  I think the ‘math’ and that ‘constant vibration frequency’ will change again and then we will resume going through iterations of vibrations., until we get one that is more stable.
Now – let me give you my single point of stating why I think there is truth in religion.  Ive seen some crazy stuff in my day.  I always said there were no things such as spirits because “something can not both be massless and float through walls, and also have mass at the same time (grab you, hurt you, throw things, etc…)  But understanding the above makes it absolutely plausible.  Knowing there are 7 other dimensions (gravity being one of them) its not farfetched to think that life could exist in other dimensions but not have mass because the math works out PERFECTLY for things to not have mass…  So there could easily be another being that does not have mass (spirit/demon whatever you want to call it) but could manipulate objects, because it can manipulate gravity (one of the dimensions)  Pushing something across the room may simply be creating a gravitational field and moving it away.  Now – one last thing.  Its not necessarily A gravitation field – I think it’s a PUSH not a pull – I think it very well could be the negating of a gravitational field in a certain way to make something move.  Moving something just means manipulating gravity to say ‘there is LESS Gravity on the side pushing it … to move it to where you want’
I can literally write 500 pages about the different concepts of gravity and how they work, integrate it with the big bang, and how certain theories and ideas work, and its perfectly plausible.  
I have no need for god/religion to ‘explain away’ that ‘someone’ did it ‘magically’  and understanding how something COULD happen often resolves itself to understanding whether it is likely or not, and in fact – understanding how MORE things work, by building off of other likely scenarios.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; I think that we should start telling teens about who and where the drugs come from, and how the money that funds these criminal organizations result in the exploitation and harm of innocent people. These lessons should probably be visceral for maximum impact.

A lot of people do get harmed in the drug industry, but exposing children to gang-life wouldn't help. Sure they will know its dangerous but they also know that there's a chance at becoming rich and powerful over that, a small chance but nonetheless a chance. Also with YOLO, and grand theft-auto mixed, kids will easily break thought that morality barrier. (I'm not saying GTA is bad and I've played their old games and I don't care if kids play it as long as they're mature about it. But if reckless kids get it they might not know better.)

On the other hand, kids and teens care about themselves ALOT. If you tell them the effect drugs have on yourself they might be more scared than telling them what happens to the other end in a drug deal.

Edit: forgot to say that I'm not saying that's how we should teach them, we could do both ways but keep the ""Drug effects"" way of teaching strong.","1375316118"

"socialskills","t5_2r275","I suspect there might be some useful nugget in the r/StLouis story. 

For whatever reason personal to your life, the fact that the person harassing you was black was a relevant detail in the story. But the fact that you emphasized or even mentioned his race when telling the story instantly communicates a few things about you that may or may not be true: 

1) you think of ""black people"" as a monotone group, and think therefore that it's a useful descriptor everyone will interpret the same way. 

2) you are unaware or do not care that race is a sensitive issue anywhere, and especially in the United States. There are still many people still alive today who easily remember a time when ""black people"" was in fact a descriptor that the entirety of the rest of society did in fact interpret the same way. It defined everything about their lives. 

3) you do not think about or care how you are being perceived when you talk.

Many people would respond to the negative reaction you received by realizing how you came across, feeling bad about being (fairly or unfairly) perceived in that way, and apologize. If you were kicked out, I suspect it is because the situation escalated because you dug in your heels and focused on how you felt and what you wanted to say, and did not think about how your words and attitude makes people feel - about themselves and about you. Your history of being serially kicked out of things suggests that this may be a pattern.

It might be worth thinking about the fact that when you talk to someone, there are two simultaneous processes happening. One is that you are saying what you feel like saying, and the other is that what you are saying, and the way you are saying it, is making people feel things and building the their perception of you.

So if you could work on one thing, maybe it would be trying to focus a little less on what you are feeling and want to say, and try focusing on making people feel good when they are around you. Compliment people, try to take a genuine interest in their lives and their interests. When conflict arises, consider a conciliatory approach for the sake of social harmony over your need to ""be heard"" and feel 100% understood.

You have no fear of ever dating him, unless of course once hes bought property, and is dating again, you guys meet. He doesn't care right now if his lifestyle is that of anothers, as he is not looking for a gal in that way. So, how can he be a deal breaker if he hasn't laid a deal on the table?? Interesting to post it for sure, but taking it way to serious for a guy who isn't dating, but only seeking friends. 
And PS- He has an amazing job, and is saving thousands of dollars. He has barely any debt, and is getting that paid off. He's doing way better than most Americans. When he is ready to date, that girl will be damn lucky as he will be able to afford to take care of her if she ever needed it. And besides that, he has an amazing heart.

"TalesFromYourServer","t5_2v480","I think your problem is that you think all of these are needed for to live, when they really aren't.

&gt; Car. Gas.

Rarely necessary. Try to find somewhere close to where you work and you won't have to own a car. Alternately, use public transportation, which would be another 20 dollars a month or so depending where you live.

&gt;Heating

Covered in utilities. Remember, you are splitting the space with other people, so this should be pretty cheap. A 2 bedroom apartment split between 4 people has pretty low utility costs.

&gt;Insurance. Maintenance. 

No car or home insurance, as you don't need to own either. Maintenance will be covered by your landlord. 

&gt;Student loans. Tuition.

Neither necessary to live. Also, very low if you are making minimum payments.

&gt;Doctor. Dentist. Medical insurance. Prescriptions. Medications. 

Health insurance will be 63 dollars a month at this income level.

http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#income-type=dollars&amp;income=13680&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=0&amp;adult-count=1&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=21&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;child-count=0&amp;child-tobacco=0


&gt;Clothes. Children

Clothes are a trivial cost. Children are a complicated one, they aren't necessary for living though. And would be better addressed through welfare as not everyone has children.

&gt;tate, federal, FICA, property tax, and sales tax. 

Taxes are going to be almost 0 at this income rate. You can actually request that your employer give you your entire wage and you handle the income tax yourself, which allows you to get the money sooner instead of waiting for a refund. And as mentioned earlier, you don't need to own a home so no property tax. 

Mentioning sales tax tells me you know very little about living as a poor person, because they wouldn't buy anything that has a sales tax attached to it. Those aren't necessities.

So to crystalize.

We have 670 after covering apartment utilities and food. We have to pay for health insurance and transportation. Transportation is 20 dollars a month, or 0 if you can bike to work. Health insurance is 63 dollars a month.

This person on minimum wage still has 587 dollars a month left over for savings. Over half his income. Even if he ends up having to pay 10 percent of his income in taxes(which vary by state), thats still leaves 450 dollars a month in savings and for any health bills that insurance doesn't cover. With a few months savings, you could buy a car if you really wanted to. And you would have enough money to pay insurance and gas. 

You would definitely have enough left over to take courses at your local community college, which would help you get an even better job.","1375316139"

1. It makes your internet faster because it's closer to the atmospheric internet broadcast waves.  
2. It means your neighbors can't access your wifi; the signal will go right over their houses and won't even come up in their Available Networks list.  
3. NSA can't eavesdrop on your internet if your router is that high; it has to be on the same level as their van parked in the street.  
4. You will have less spam and viruses, as they have trouble going uphill into a router.  
5. People using the wifi upstairs in their bedrooms will have faster download speeds because they're closer to the router.
6. It keeps the kids from messing with your internet parental settings. If they can't reach it, they can't change it.
7. Your internet pixel usage will be more efficient because the signal will flow downhill from the router.  
8. It broadcasts a cone of protection around your house, which it can't do if it's lower down. 
9. When burglars break into your home and steal all your computer equipment, they will overlook the router, and then at least you won't have to replace that. 
10. You can download an app to make it function as a smoke detector, too, and for that it needs to be up high; ask any fire department.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Your deck doesn't have a very clear direction. It looks like you wanna sit around with Fog Bank, Safety Sphere, D Sphere, etc and mill them out. In which case, you're gonna want more reliable things than just the Curse and Traumatize

Then you have the Stalkers and the enchantments which don't move your game plan forward. I get you want the Archanist and Silence combo, but that's turn 4 and by then you're going to be really behind on the board. Nothing helps you stabilize. Even if you draw the perfect hand, by the time you play it not only are you on the back foot you are almost dead too. 

I'd suggest going bant so you have access to Farseek. Take out all the auras and creatures b/c that doesn't help you turtle. Take the 1 Jace and 1 Indestructible out b/c generally 1 of's aren't worth much. Take out Silence b/c you're taking out Arcanist. Make it a set of O-rings and D-spheres.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I grew up in a dirt poor neighborhood.  College was one of those things that wasn't mentioned.  My mom worked retail, my old man was a welder, my grandfather worked for GM and then as a welder, too.  College wasn't a thing you needed or thought about.  

Then I got to school and from 5th grade on, it was all any teacher talked about.  

Problem was, by 5th grade I had already made my mind to be done with school the second I possibly could.  

I know a lot of people say their school was like a prison but believe me, mine was a prison.  I won't go into the details, that's a long story and entirely different story at that.  Point was, the educational system had left such a shitty taste in my mouth that I never wanted to see the inside of a classroom again so long as I lived.  It's fair to say I still get chills when I drive by a school.  It was that bad.

I know college and high school/middle schools are entirely different things but my bias against any form of institutional learning was already there.

So after 9th grade I tested out of high school.  And never stepped foot in any school again.

I worked retail for a number of years and during that time my disdain for college grew stronger.  Most of the people I worked with were college graduates, some with multiple degrees, and they were still working the same crappy retail job I was doing.  And I was better off.  I had my own apt, they had roommates, they had thousands of dollars in student loan debt, I didn't.  The managers had degrees, but in what?  Theater.  Drama.  How did that qualify you to manage a bookstore?

And when I would meet people in ""real jobs"" office space types, they might have degrees but in nothing related to what they were doing.  I began to get a real and true hatred for the system that determined one HAD to have a degree in order to get a job.  Didn't seem to matter what the degree was in, just so long as they had one.  Why, you have a degree in goat-ball-licking.  Sure, that qualifies you to come work as an admin in this four person company that pays $9 an hour.  WTF was the point?

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I was smarter than most of the people I'd met with a college degree.  I found zero need to sit in a room and be lectured for four or more years just to have a piece of paper.  I was determined to prove I could do things on my own, just as well as anybody with a degree.

One might be tempted to think I'm a slacker.  But...I turn 36 in a week.  I worked on four presidential campaigns, three local political campaigns, ran for local office myself.  Published three books.  I own my own home.  I work in one of the most critical divisions of a Fortune 500 company.  I have a diverse employment background and training in areas that, if this job were to go south, would provide me the means to get another job easily enough.   I have a year's worth of living expenses in the bank.  And I have zero debt.  Outside of a reasonable mortgage I literally owe nothing to anyone.  No credit cards, no car payments, no loans--nothing.  I'm laid back, but no slacker.  

My friends with the college degrees, meanwhile, are still working in the same retail job they were fifteen years ago.

So why didn't I go to college?  The so-called higher education system in this country is scam intent on ruining people financially, I had a strong hatred for institutional learning and I saw absolutely no value in it whatsoever.  


None of this is to shit on people who did go to college, plenty are smart folks who need that degree for whatever they do--I'd want my doctor or lawyer to have plenty of education.  But by and large its been my experience that the average person doesn't need to spend tens of thousands of dollars to get a piece of paper that ultimately serves little to no purpose in life.  I'm proof of that.","1375316157"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;transhumanism based on the idea of Ray Kurzweils the singularity
  
Transhumanism is the idea that humans can/will transcend our current biology with technological improvement. It's not intrinsically linked to 'the singularity,' nor is it 'based' on Kurzweil's ideas, as Transhumanism (often by other names) has essentially been the entire point of society since it's inception. 
  
&gt; Ray Kurzweils the singularity
  
The Singularity, in the context you're using, is actually a specific thing, namely when we create machines that become capable of creating newer and better machines faster than we can create them ourselves. This would lead to these machines rapidly outpacing human intelligence, or even the need for humans in it's process of technological advancement. Funnily, it's more probable that these machines would simply leave earth, for the sake of 'greener pastures' on Titan or Triton (where hydrocarbons flow as rivers, minerals are plentiful, lower temperatures allow easier cooling of equipment, and gravity is much lighter.)
  
Your idea also totally ignores the fact that The Singularity, as described, would probably also involve humans augmenting themselves with machines and nootropics to be part of this emergent superintelligence. 
  
&gt;the transumanists want us to merge our consciousness with robots so that we can essentially live forever.
  
The fuck? Transhumanists (generally) want to improve and advance the human condition, not 'merge our brains with robots,' whatever the hell that means. People have, for ages, worked towards improving our lot in the world through technology (medicine, aspirin, factories, wheel chairs, prosthesis, etc,) to the point where we have cyborgs acting as a productive part of our society (Stephen Hawking, anyone with a cochlear implant, anyone with a pace-maker or a prosthetic heart.) It's not unnatural to assume that humans may eventually become more machine than man at some point, but it's certainly not what 'transhumanists want us to do.'
  
&gt; the movement has a spooky cultish feel to it
  
If your made-up thing about mechano-cultists were true, I'de be weirded out myself. As it stands, Transhumanism doesn't involve mechano-cults, so I'm not nearly as afraid of the movement as I am afraid that your opinion is one that is shared by others. 
  
&gt;im not sure what will happen when we do wake up the machines
  
See, Terminator 2 is my second favorite movie of all time, and yet I'm fairly certain our first AI will probably not try to nuke us all 'just cuz.' Seeing as people have been wrestling with the same questions about 'how could this work' or if Strong AI is even possible, I think we will be adequately prepared for AI when it arrives, so long as we don't go and make a Van Neumann probe on accident.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think it's good that you don't want anything. Nothing you can buy will bring you that contentment, and it's great you've realized that.

My advice would just be to take things one day at a time. Find out what you value, and then do everything you do with those values in mind. Playing a sport, hanging with friends, even doing the laundry. 

Don't get lost in the bigger picture of your life's purpose or whatever. Just think about what you can right now, in this moment, to be the person who you can be. Don't look back, because you're not going that way. Don't look to the future, because anxiety solves nothing. All you can control is how you do what you do right now. If you take care of that, the future will take care of itself.

Anyway, that's my advice. You've had different life experiences and beliefs though, so just remember that I'm just a random guy saying this. But this  is what keeps me going each and every day.","1375316165"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;As you can imagine this allowed for far more combat efficiency.

Just to emphasis this point from a contemporary infantry perspective, the Light Machine Gun is the absolute backbone of a squad's and platoon's firepower. You can easily carry them forward and set them up, and they are *far* more effective weapons than rifles.

A 1940s fire team would have had a BAR or similar automatic rifle as its main weapon, i.e. a weapon roughly comparable to a modern assault rifle, not capable of the rate of sustained fire of a proper MG.

Getting a lightweight proper MG than can be carried by the troops right up the front instead of having to wait for a heavy watercooled beast allows you to attack a position, capture it, and straight away have murderous fire available to you, instead of being vulnerable to counterattack until the heavy weapons arrive.

Getting semi-auto M1 Garands and carbines instead of bolt action rifles would also make a big difference: If you and every one of your mates can get 10 aimed shots off while the enemy charges 50 metres across the open at you instead of only 3 each, that makes a big difference.","1375316165"

"politics","t5_2cneq","In any job there's an experience ceiling where increasing the amount of experience workers have doesn't increase your profitability anymore. Building cars likely has a high experience ceiling, it likely takes years for a worker to get to the point where they are turning out cars as fast as a person can, regardless of how much more experience they get. Minimizing turnover is sound business strategy there, pay people more, keep them longer, turn out more cars as a result.

Fast food however, you're talking about hitting the experience ceiling in a couple weeks. I worked in fast food (KFC) and can tell you that normally it's the cooking time you're waiting for. It takes X minutes to cook Y number of food items. No matter how good you get at preparing burgers, breading chicken, or wrapping burritos, the cook time is your main bottleneck. Hell, I could bread about four rounds of chicken in the time it took to cook one batch. My increased speed and experience was totally worthless to the company since it's impossible to speed up the fryer itself.

As for the Casey Anthony thing, they found useful evidence, but was not strong enough to convict her. The fact that she googled it prior to her kids death, if you ask any lawyer, is miles away from hard evidence. The NSA is more looking out for keywords that could indicate a terrorist attack and hopefully prevent it. i.e. server recognise a flagged word, the NSA check it out, looks like some high-level terrorists are emailing about bombing a certain building, they bump up the security there, keep an eye out and trap the terrorists. This is something that could not be done without the NSA. And even if it isn't preemptive and they don't catch something before it goes down, they have the powers to hand which means they can find who committed a terror crime, bring them to justice and discover how large the organisation is.

He also claims to be for ""reasonable"" regulation of financial markets, but dollars to donuts if he were back as chairman he would pursue the exact same policies, that is, allowing the markets as much unfettered freedom as possible while fighting tooth and nail against even reasonable attempts to reign in obvious speculation or to even minimally regulate massive off-the-books exchanges in exotic derivatives. He genuinely believes that unregulated or barely regulated markets are self-correcting, despite abundant historical evidence that they are frequently self-destructive.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","It's kinda hard to judge because they both had really disappointing seasons, but given Loui's ability to play in all situations (i.e. PK), I think I'd give him the nod. 

I'm also big on body of work as opposed to potential when it comes to giving a player the benefit of the doubt. Loui's got the much more impressive body of work to date. Whereas Benn gets cut a lot of slack because of his ""potential"" that he's never really reached.

Like I said, I'd still keep Benn over Eriksson if I was the GM of an NHL team. Because of his youth and potential. But he's not better than Eriksson *right now*.

Oh, and Benn isn't a superstar by any stretch. And there's no way he's one of the best players in the league very soon. I'll be thrilled if he's a consistent 70-75 point guy on the wing. Which is a great player, but unless you're also bringing the two-way game of a guy like Bergeron, that's not enough to be one of the best players in the league.","1375316175"

Alternatively, Gardein and Beyond Meat make a great chicken substitutes. But, I haven't had real chicken in almost five years, so you may feel differently than I do.

Finally, you could consider using soybeans instead of tofu or chicken. I usually keep some bulk soybeans on hand. Or really, any kind of bean that you like. But if you are going to substitute bean (tofu, beans) products for chicken, I would add a little extra cooking oil when making your food.

Minimumtyp's Earth would work perfectly with Exalted's elements, possibly even better than Avatar's, since Earth covers the stability of the world, and the Elemental Pole of Earth is in the centre of Creation, anchoring it against the chaos beyond. Fits Elder Titan perfectly.

Wow. I really overthought this.

Edit: Wood could include Venomancer and Viper, actually, since Wood is associated with poison in Exalted's cosmology. (A lot of poisons come from plants.) Especially Venomancer, given his origin in a jungle.","1375316182"

 The thing that gets me though is one of the ""tests"" for gluten intolerance is for the patient to avoid gluten for 30-90 days and see if they feel better.

When you die playing solo don't stay and watch unless you think you can learn something. There is no point staying and watching your team fail as you will just rage more and more.

Just like in poker if you get too emotional and let your emotions cloud your rational thinking and judgement then you will fail and do worse, this can be a sell-fulfilling prophecy. In poker you lose a lot of money if you get like this there is nothing like losing money to make you focus and play better, I learned a lot from playing 100's of thousands of poker hands. 

Solo because you don't have to wait. Platoons is a different skill altogether. I suggest you watch my teamwork youtube playlist to see some great examples of teamwork in platoons!

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Great read. I was thinking earlier today that this team could embody the ""Us against the world"" attitude the '03-04 team had. That was a team of players nobody wanted, and all had something to prove. Chauncey bounced around, Jordan wanted Rip gone for Stackhouse, Tay was passed over by almost every team, Sheed was seen as a headcase, and of course Ben went undrafted. They came together and formed something great.

This team should take on that same attitude. Drummond slipped all the way to 9th in his class because people thought he would be a bust and lacked any sort of motor. Jennings and Smith are more often the butt of a joke than garnering praise for their ability. Nobody wanted them. People think they are ""cancerous"". Chauncey is back for round 2 after being too old and busted for the rest of the league, and fans (Piston fans and fans of other teams as well) can't wait to get Greg Monroe off this team. If I'm the coach, I'm challenging these guys to come together and shut the rest of the world up.","1375316184"

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","Xbox One. It comes with the Kinnect in the box, you can do games like Dance Dance revolution and stuff. Also for little kids there is Kinnectimals and Kinnect sports. The PS eye only tracks light where as the Xbox One's Kinnect tracks your body and its movements. To game with a PS eye you need a light stick remote but with Kinnect you just use your body. Plus the Xbox One can be used for non gaming purposes like Skyping while watching tv, PS4 cannot do that, the Xbox one also allows you to do multiple things at once and if you have to leave to take a call or cook dinner (or eat it) then you can switch back to TV and once you are done eating you can resume your game where you left off with no hassles. If you want my opinion then I would say get the Xbox one because it is more bang for your buck and is simpler and more family friendly, but as a consumer I would say to wait till after they come out so you can get a hands on experience at a best buy and decide for yourself since most people on reddit are biased.

Bottom line: Xbox One has better quality motion gaming with more games to choose from and gives you the better value because of the other things you can use it for when you are not gaming. But it would help you make a better decision to get a hands on experience when they come out.","1375316186"

GMC (and only GMC)- Terrible drivers who think they should run off all other cars on the road with their Trucks and SUVs.  

Nissan/Infiniti- I have no idea what road etiquette is. I'll cut you off without using a turn signal. Oh, I'm in a right hand turn only lane? Let me cut you off by driving straight ahead. Off the road, they're still cunts who have the attitude that rivals BMW, Audi, and Lexus drivers. 

Subaru- What are turn signals? Excluding the WRX and BRZ- shops at Whole Foods, goes hiking or bike rides of at least 10 miles every weekend.   

VW/Audi- In a Frat or a Sorority. Also, douche. 

Buick- 50 or older, and drives slow. 

Toyota- Not really interested in cars. Likes to be anonymous and drives slow. Corollas will be driven by someone who is at least part hispanic. If it's a Prius, they're either a woman or if they're a man, they're 40 or older. Prius' shop at Whole Foods. 

Honda- If the car has been modded with any of the following: oversized spoilers, a fart can muffler, extremely dark tinted windows, or HID lights, you're from the ghetto. This goes for any make/model, but Hondas are notorious for these mods. 

BMW- I own the road, and need to show off my massive douchebaggery. Look at me everybody! Life is in the fast lane. 

Mercedes as well as Lexus- Middle aged, generally snobby and arrogant. Yet, they like to live at a leisurely pace. Not really into cars either, but they like to at least show off that they have some money. 

Lincoln- If they're not elderly, you have some shade of gray hair, and look like they could be working in some sort of creativity firm. 

Porsche- Over 40, nouveau riche, and having a mid-life crisis. Especially if the Porsche is yellow.

Cadillac- Black, and/or elderly.  
 
Any minivan, or medium/large SUV (Chevy Tahoe and larger) wins an automatic assumption of being a soccer mom. Chrysler Town and Country minivan drivers have the added assumption that they're overweight and regularly shop at Walmart.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I don't see how Destinys tangent and your quotes (~~btw, is there a source?~~) are mutually exclusive. The studies are form 2012, 2010 and 2004, so 1, 3 and 9 years ago. I mean, I don't disagree with you, there certainly are women who played games longer than 10 years ago. ~~But your statement that they made up a *'substantial portion of the market'* since 20 years ago, is not supported by that~~. Destiny also doesn't specify what games he means and neither does the study. Social/mobile/casual gaming and console gaming could change the outcome significantly in difference to (for the lack of a better word) *hardcore* PC-gaming 
  
But I can see your point, that a statement that is pure speculation isn't a great start. Destinys point of view is probably based on the perceived situation back in the 1980s and 1990s (and maybe in the early 2000s). Back then, 'being a nerd' meant doing something you liked while being looked down upon by the more popular kids. And it was mostly a boy-thing. And I would argue, most hardcore (and pro) gamers are still boys/men, because they grow up back then, with these games. Maybe a lot of these people feel betrayed by so-called 'nerd girls', because they weren't there when they were young. So now, every girl starting to become serious about games is just 'jumping an a bandwagon'.  

At least that's my perception from the time I spend in multiplayer forums and on gaming websites.  


To your last point, about misrepresentation: Gamers lived with this stereotype since the dawn of videogames, that is not something exclusively female gamers have to experience. Outside of the CoD franchise, Skyrim or major titles this is still an issue.

"armawasteland","t5_2vc6w","I'm sure you're aware that ACE is a mod for ARMA. Wasteland (and lots of other game types) is not a mod but a mission file. A customised scinario that a user(s) has developed and then stuck on a server for all to enjoy. This scinario / mission file / game type, what ever you want to call it, has been created for the vanilla version of ARMA. It's using the resources that the plain old ARMA game and it's expansions has to offer.

A mod introduces a wider range of resources. These resources will have different coding relating to them in the mission file. As the server you want to play on doesn't run a mission file that has been created for the mod, the code will not be translated well by the game.

(Not trying to patronise you here, just state a clear difference. Bare with me on this one)

That's to say if you have a mod that gives you additional vehicles, you will be able to see and interact with the vehicles (some features of the vehicles that run server-side may not be executable (afterburner on a jet, fast roping etc)) but those who do not have the mod won't be able to see/interact with the vehicle. If the vehicle is weaponized, the weapons will still cause damage. So those who do not have the mod are now being attacked by invisible death machines. Although if the server doesn't have the mod running, you're not admin or scripting, then the vehicles wont spawn anyway... but the point translates across lots of different instances.
For an ACE specific instance if the server isn't running ACE and you join it running ACE then how are you going to use satchels properly? How are you going to heal if you're shot? How is a pilot going to lock on your laser frequency when he can't change to yours? and the list goes on. It's like trying to run DayZ on a domination server. It's 'a different game'. 

So in short, because the additional resources of the mod will not be supported by the server and other players.

Furthermore, if the mod installed on your PC doesn't have a 'bikey' file that the server requires to run that mod, then the server might say 'no' also. This is a method of stopping people running their own scripts and bits of code that may allow them to do things that people might not want you to do. Scripting basically. I'm sure you can tell that it's not a hugely successful method.

TL;DR: because the additional resources of the mod will not be supported by the server and other players and to cut down on malicious scripting. 

Hope that's helped!

Ich kann schon einige AS-Anhänger von damals verstehen, die sich mit RBS nicht anfreunden können. Und ich find selber, dass Mateschitz die Übernahme ziemlich verschissen hat. Er war einfach viel zu naiv zu glauben, dass er mal eben einen traditionsreichen Verein einfach 1:1 und ohne großen Widerstand übernehmen kann. Allerdings muss man dazusagen, dass AS damals am Abgrund stand, und die andere Lösung wohl der grausame, langsame Niedergang gewesen wär, so in etwa wie beim FC Tirol. Deswegen finde ich, dass man das bei dem ganzen auch beachten sollte.

Nun, ein paar Jahre später und das Stadion ist immer noch leer. Ich mein schon, dass wenn es Red Bull damals etwas geschickter gemacht hätte, der Salat nicht so groß wär, wie er jetzt immer noch ist. Aber es ist halt so gelaufen, man kanns nicht mehr ändern. Und mittlerweile finde ich, dass RBS auch einiges an Positivem mit sich bringt (habs ja schon erwähnt oben).

* openness about his and my sexuality
* understanding of each other's motivations, desires, and perceptions from those nights (emotional experience vs. physical experience)
* me having had emotional attachment to the event (""lingering feelings"")
* confirmation that he is straight and not gay (""wasn't his cup of tea"")
* deeper level of trust between him and I
* personal growth on my part to respect him (""I am mindful not to sneak glances at him when he goes to the shower"")
* wider topics to discuss with each other (""[we] talk with each other about some seriously heavy shit (addictions, horrible family pasts, fears/vulnerabilities, etc."")
* deeper level of confidence in confiding in one another (""We have both entrusted each other so much that each of us possess the power to destroy one another’s lives."")
* deeper level of love/bonding with one another (""you stupid fuck, you should know this already!”)
* affirmation of loyalty to one another (""I'm lucky enough to have a friend that I love so deeply that I would go to war with (professionally and literally), a friend that has my back, a friend to grow old with."")

Not all of them dropped everything to purse the civil rights movement, they simply behaved ethically in the normal lives.&lt;/quote&gt;

Don't equate my points with ""following orders"" as that's not what I said. The civil rights movement doesn't hold a candle to war. Yes it was bad and should have been a priority, but to say it was as bad as war or genocide is frankly ridiculous. Organizations cannot inherently be unethical.

I'd say GTAV is very likely to have 'gone gold' within the next 10 days. I'd like to think they have the last 30 days (a month or so) to concentrate 100% on printing, distribution etc.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You are starting from the top down.  You gotta look bottom up.  Every penny of McDonald's profit comes from a leaf of lettuce bought cheaper, a tomato picked faster, a kid who is willing to work for a lower wage, a hamburger successfully marketed and sold for a slightly higher price.  Over time and across locations, those pennies add up to possible millions and billions.

Then you come in with your top-down approach and want to take half of their ""exorbitant"" profit.  That's a tax.  

""*I know!*"", you say. ""*Let's FORCE them to pay people more!*""  

Well, a single company cannot fight the forces of the entire market.  You price unskilled labor out of the market, McDonald's does a RoI analysis, and within a few years fires half of the workforce because they now have a robot who can do it cheaper.  It already happened in grocery stores -- fast food is next.

As a small business owner myself, I am not hiring full-time staff.  I might as well hang up signs ""free money here"" and ""sue me please"".

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;Do you not remember 1920's prohibition?

Yes, I do. Buckle up, history lesson inbound. 

The 1920s led to a rise in the organization and success of American organized crime. Before that time, there had been little success on a national level. Prohibition allowed crime syndicates to supply a good to the people when they wanted it, and had few alternatives. Did prohibition work? No. Of course not. The Chicago Outfit, for instance, thrived on bootlegging alcohol. What happened when prohibition was over? Did the huge crime syndicates disappear, as their good was no longer needed in the manner they provided? Hell no. They diversified. They grew so powerful, so rich, so widespread they easily spread their influence and power to other areas. The mafias moved into business in loans (even owning large banks), gambling (owning many large casinos, many of which are still owned to this day), prostitution, narcotics distribution, legitimate business, labor racketeering, pornography, and stock trading. In fact, the mafia grew and grew until its peak in the 1960s. It wasn't until the RICO Act in 1970 that the American mafia really begin to fall apart. (And this was also in large part because of international influence from other organized crime syndicates). The prohibition was essentially a training ground, a college if you will, for the mafia. They flourished for another 40 years. Ending prohibition did not bring about the downfall of the organized crime outfits. At all. That is just plain historical fact. 

&gt;You must be ignoring the multiple examples where regulation has directly correlated with a drop in drug use/abuse/and violence.

Legalizing a good does not mean the provider of the good goes away. Which is my entire point.

&gt;To argue that regulating drugs in the U.S. would have no bearing on their methods

That's the opposite of what I've said. Look:

&gt;Cartels would still operate and traffic drugs even if drugs were perfectly legal in the US. They would simply not have to operate in the dark.

&gt;contrarian to facts... buffered by countless experts... shown to be true by real world examples

You're throwing all of these out while being completely wrong about what you've talked about. Any criminologist will tell you that legalizing a good does not mean the provider of the good disappears. Just the same as prohibiting a good does not mean the good disappears. (For instance, you can make guns illegal, but gangs in inner cities will still have guns). I'm just telling you the fact of the matter. 

Just because you legalize something does not mean the gangs, cartels, mafias, will disappear. They are rich, powerful, smart, efficient, and productive. They have all been around for a very long time. Saying that the cartels in Mexico will not operate if the drug war is cancelled, or drugs are legalized, is wrong. Further, the cartels are not here simply because drugs are illegal. Drugs are a good they provide, and it is profitable. Do not mistake me, the legality of drugs (or the lack thereof) has strongly contributed to the rise of Mexican drug cartels. But do not be fooled into thinking that they will be crippled by ending the drug war and legalizing drugs.","1375316209"

I agree entirely on the point that we have the same goal but different ideas of how it is to be achieved, but I hope you can see where we're coming from when we talk of feminism as a threat. Do you realise how much hostility people endure for feeling it necessary to go outside of feminism to address men's issues? We're misogynists, sexists, rape apologists, all just because we don't believe that ideas like patriarchy are accurate or conducive to addressing men's issues.

While there's certainly a lot of hostility going the other way too, from what I see it's more in response. It's not ""you can't have your perspective"" (which is what we hear from a lot of feminists), it's ""let us have our perspective too"".

I've never used them. So my point stands. Also standing you cannot reduce marriage to a series of arbitrary government benefits and say you respect the institution and aren't trying to devalue it. You're either being dishonest or don't understand the issue. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;By whom? 

That's a private matter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm sure they

I'm sure whatever their feelings are, it's completely irrelevant to this conversation. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;That butts into the sex life of people who aren't voluntary members.

That is patently false. The Church does not prevent anyone from having sex with anyone in any manner that they would like.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I could argue not having children is selfless because rather than perpetuating ones own genes, they leave resources for other non-kin humans. 

That's a very simplistic view. And real easy to rebut. If that's your view (which is a completely separate discussion of demographics) Adopt then, as many as you can afford to raise. Or else you're still selfish. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's fine. It doesn't equate to bad character though.

Uhh. Ok your singular opinion counts as the same as any singular opinion. I for the record disagree. Being merely unhappy is not a good enough of a reason to back out of marriage. But my opinion isn't the end all be all either. Society as a whole still views divorce negatively. And they have good cause to. Divorce hurts society.

&gt;&gt;&gt;My sexually repressed groups that follow bronze aged scriptures

Marriage fidelity has objective benefit to society, and is undoubtedly the most universally accepted tenant of marriage in modern society. Devaluing marriage fidelity is an attack on the very basis of the union not just in western civilization but in civilizations throughout the world. Not just in scripture but in the history of philosophy and law as well. You cannot proclaim a moral ascendency to argue anything about marriage while denying its central operative tenant. 

 &gt;&gt;&gt;Why can't you and the church do that with homosexuals?

The Church nor I don't prevent Homosexuals from living their lives, committing to each other, living with each other, or have sex with each other. And for my part I could care less whether they stood in front of their family and friends and made promises to each other. My argument which you have never addressed and so I must assume stands unopposed, is that if Marriage is simply about benefits and convenient parings of consenting adults, it does not warrant the level of government intrusion into private lives. If that's really the case, then the institution of government sanctioned marriage should be disbanded not expanded. You can't have it both ways, unless you're a 1984 style statist and think the government should be involved in regulating all sorts of relationships between people. There is no libertarian argument for gay marriage that makes sense. The libertarian argument is that Government shouldn't make the decisions or control the institution AT ALL. 

At this point having rejected the central tenant of fidelity in marriage, and insisting government recognition of marriage is the central important factor of marriage I have to conclude you do not value marriage in any meaningful way nor know very much about marriage the Church's role, Society at large's role, nor the Government's role. 

If marriage is just about licenses and benefits then it should not exist. If that's all the Government thinks about it, they shouldn't be involved. ","1375316214"

Sure, homewrecker can MAYBE justify that, but even then it's a stretch, because the homewrecker is situational.

Proposed fix: Longer time to be able to be swung after switching to it. This makes it still a killing weapon, but gives the person on the other end of it a fighting chance to even notice their doom.

"RealEstatePhotography","t5_2sb34","Nice work - there are some things I'd suggest looking at.

Picture 3 (entry), I'd recommend getting in front of the latch and that wall on the right hand side.

Picture 6 (entrance to kitchen)  Your eyes are drawn to the wall with the thermostat and pillows - I don't know if I'd use that picture.

Picture 9 (kitchen).  The serving dish needs to go, buyers don't want to see personal artifacts in the kitchen, especially if it's blocking the view. I'd probably take the lemons out too.

Picture 10 (bathroom).  Did you photoshop yourself out of that one? I see artifacts on the mirror.  I would have tried to stand slightly farther back to get more of the room.

Picture 25 (bathroom 2).  I'd stand farther back again if possible too.

Most of what could make these shots better would be using a shorter focal length like 10-12mm.   With 16mm you're getting wide but you need ultra wide for a lot of rooms.

Also, you can get rid of the blown out whites with the windows by shooting two of the same shots at different exposures and blending them in post/photoshop.  This will make a more accurate representation of what the view is like outside the window.

Tell the sellers (or the agent) that while this is on the market, I'd suggest using incandescent bulbs instead of CFL (CFL makes things VERY yellow) and using Halogen bulbs for can lighting.  Its a small investment for them to make that makes a HUGE difference in pictures as well as in real life when someone is looking at the home.

----

Galluch sees a group of people by the lumber pile so he walks over to join them. “Hello my hard working friend. Today I’ll be helping you in your quest to move these logs. What can I do to help?” The man nods his head motioning it toward the rope, but Galluch didn’t understand. “Yes, Greetings friend. Now what should I do?” The man continues to motion down toward the rope, but Galluch finds himself oblivious until the man blurts it out. “Ha, what a fool I am. Well let’s move this wood.” Galluch wraps the ropes around his wrist and holds them tightly. He counts to three with the other man and together they lift the log up and bring it to the other pile across the street. Galluch moved about fifty logs altogether, his back aching by the end, but begins the ,an that he is, not once did he show it.  

The man then turns to him and says, “You Hammer Nail Log Now.” Furious by that insult on his honour he was about to confront the man when he heard him talk the same way to someone else. It seems that the man was a tad slow, but a very hard worker.  Galluch then walks over to the other side where he had moved the pile. It was time to put nails in the planks. Galluch had gotten use to this since he had to fix his ship on the way to East Blue. He quickly went through the planks nailing each one perfectly symmetrical. Just like the log piles, it slowly dwindled down. Before he knew it, Galluch was finished. He was exhausted as were the other workers there, but he cheered them up with a tale of his bravado. Afterwards he then returned to Chip for his payment.","1375316221"

So one day she was giving me shit and I walked away from her. She started yelling for me and I just told her, ""You give me crap everyday. You mock me and call me terrible things. I'm done. Bag your own fucking groceries.""

I felt terrible after and the next day actually told my manager. When I explained the situation, he just stared at me and asked, ""Who was this?"" When I told him who, he responded, ""Oh god, I hate that woman.""

He then explained how she treated him like shit and then told me that if she came back in, I could just walk away and go do something else. I was more valuable to the store then her business.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Islam doesn't have a religion problem, it has a HR problem. Even as Muslims, we're not necessarily taught about Islam from a mercy-forgiveness angle, typically we get the Hell's Fire cliffsnotes version. It is up to us to rebrand the religion as it actually is, stop obsessing over the punishment and look more to the blessings, both in theory and in practice. By that I mean our largest organizations shouldn't be holy militias and leaders wanting to wipe countries off the face of the earth, they should be people known for their charity, love, acceptance of others. Our biggest focus shouldn't be how we are wronged by others, but rather, how the world is filled with good people and we need to unite with them. 

I'm a cynic, so this may be meaningless, but I think the majority of the CULTURES of the people that happen to be Muslim are hard-wired towards the other approach. Hot tempers, too much emphasis on pride in this life and they can never bring themselves low enough to sacrifice their own egos to become true humble servants by turning the other cheek every now and then.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think the corporation becomes a virus when it becomes publicly held. You're beholden to shareholders whose only concern is your profits increasing so that you can pay them a bigger dividend and/or they can sell at a higher price when the time is right. And much of the middle class depends on the whims of these markets for their retirement funds (since employer-paid pensions are basically dead). If corporations raise wages then their profits go down (unless they can increase revenues or cut costs some other way, but labor is usually the easiest thing to slash), and shareholders bitch. Therefore, the system must perpetuate itself because everyone involved is looking out for #1.

As long as we have financial markets with instantaneous information 24/7, short-term profit will often come before long-term goals. It's difficult for executives to think beyond the next quarter or the next board meeting, because ultimately they are not the owners and they do not control the beast. Eventually the extreme short-term orientation leads the corporation into a downward spiral, and the CEO escapes with a golden parachute to do the same to another company. Just like a virus.

EDIT: And another thing! Shareholders should not be the only *stakeholders* a corporation needs to satisfy. Employees, customers, the environment...all very important for long-term success. Oh, wait. Never mind.","1375316234"

The center divide of the 805 there has jersey barriers for construction at that time, making the gap between the 1 &amp; 2 lanes smaller than normal, and at the very beginning you see the guy on the R1 go lanesplitting past there MUCH too fast, so I was waiting for him to clear before I worked my way over to that lane, which is normally a bit ahead of where the incident happened.

I was guessing one of his reasons for being a jackhole was he thought he was going to tell me which lane to go down.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;You can learn a marketable skill, but few employers care what you say you can do and rather care about certifications which cost money.

As a web developer with more work than I can handle coming in... at a young age with no degrees or certifications, I can offer a personal refute on this point. You may not be able to work for huge corporations that tunnel vision on pieces of paper... but there IS work out there for qualified individuals without certifications or degrees.

&gt;However, to suggest that requiring people at the bottom to do this to earn what those in the middle get for by birthright seems to me inherently wrong.

What is a birthright of the middle? A degree? If that is what you mean I really don't understand how you come to that conclusion.

&gt;I'm not saying we should give them their living for free, or that even that we should raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, but that the system as it is now is entirely insufficient.

The main issue I see with places like McDonalds is the lack of beliefs or morals of their customers. The concern that McDonalds raising their prices would drop profits proves that customers would shift to other places solely based on price. Instead they should support the companies who treat their employees well even if it means shelling out an extra buck here and there. Until the masses come around to this realization they are simply endlessly supporting the system and then bitching about it being there.","1375316238"

"anime","t5_2qh22","_(oh god so late)_

I was following along with vague interest, but this ep made me sit up and take notice. 

Because! It has as a major (if not main) character a _programmer teaching a nascent [singleton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(global_governance\)) Strong AI_. 

...I uh bwuh whuh BULLET POINTS ORGANISATION GO 

* Current thought on how Strong AI should/would work does indeed say it should coherently extrapolate and/or aggregate what humanity would want and then would do whatever it takes to get that done. 

* ""Adverse effects of a vertical society"" - Rui is willing to let her baby AI help, but still wants to solve things collectively: (s)he's idealistic enough to believe that humanity's _nature_, when unfettered from a vertical society, will be naturally strategic and problem-solving.

* But (s)he's _wrong_, at least partially - in this case [the bystander effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) and [basic conformity effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch%27s_Conformity_Experiment) are a completely adequate explanation of why some people did nothing. The show acknowledges this, with the gamification; it's _necessary_ to assign people quests, and it's also necessary to get them to value GALAXpoints, alongside the warm fuzzies of helping your fellow man bla bla.

* Corollary: GALAX and X will still need to be around even in the horizontal society. This is a problem for any vision of a fully horizontal society - but is that Rui's vision or the _show_'s vision?

* Because these problems of volition and strategy and general inability to solve our problems - fundamentally, that we humans are trapped in our buggy meat brains - this is precisely why people are researching Strong AI _in the first place_. 

* And if the fully horizontal society is just Rui's vision, if the show's going to acknowledge that X has some role in this new world order, then that's an actual genuine treatment of the idea of a singleton AI! One which doesn't diminish _or_ exaggerate humanity's agency!

* This is genuinely, really exciting to see being talked about, with this much apparent care, in _popular media_. 

* Holy shit. Holy _shit_.

Now, of course, I don't know this is where the show's going. Certainly, there's reason to believe it's _not_; so far it's seemed much more concerned about the implications on the individual and basically entirely positive on human agency. The ""breeding distrust in strangers"" bit also fits more naturally in this than in the Strong AI story.

Rui and X haven't really have had much screentime, and what they have is totally consistent so far with a show that uses the gamification as a shtick, a little thing added for plausibility. (Though it will seem a bit weird; people have already started picking up on how the gamification is problematic when looked at from this angle.)

But the show _could be_ going there. It's got the pieces in place for it.

...

_Holy shit_.

Regarding Hajime - so far, she doesn't feel very protagonisty at all to me, actually. She's basically a static catalyst to the stories of everyone _around her_, and we only focus on her because she represents the change and conflict the show's about. Right?

Ferrari don't shy away from the fact that it's a great privilege offered to few people to drive a Ferrari, but RBR have gotten so arrogant that they feel almost no one is worthy to drive their car.

Such a stupid comment for Tost to make, what a blow to Ricciardo's confidence coming into a 4 week break, after a poor result in Hungary due to their shitty strategy again.

McLaren took a gamble on Perez, who only has a half season more experience than Ricciardo. Sure, he's stood on a podium but he had the car to do so. He had a shaky start to his McLaren career and the car hasn't been good enough to fight for podiums, but he's done quite well considering the pressure on him.

RBR/STR need to give Ricciardo the same chance to show he CAN handle being an RBR driver, rather than saying he probably couldn't.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Because of the winner's curse. In any auction situation the team who wins the bid by definition pays more than anyone else thinks that they are worth. Arsenal just has a problem with the idea of spending more than a player is worth so over and over they get outbid even though they have money in the bank. They are always waiting for a properly valued player- the problem is that it just takes 1 team to overpay and then you miss out. 

SO Arsenal ends up with players that they have a structural advantage to get. Cazorla was below market value because Arsenal could pay cash immediately. Giroud had a reasonable release clause. Podolski very much wanted to play for Arsenal and wasn't shopping himself around. 

Or they try and jump early, trying to recognize talent before the price explodes. Walcott, Chamberlain, Sanogo, Koscielny, etc. These are the players that Arsenal can look at as a bargain. 

The strict wage structure that Arsenal had was also a complete blunder. It is probably the single biggest things causing them to miss out on top talent. 

And honestly- I think that Arsenal needs to realize that in order to recruit players you can either pay through transfer fees which lower competition or you can pay through higher wages since you have saved money on not paying ridiculous transfer fees. The problem is that Arsenal both was trying to pay low transfer fees and were adhering to a ridiculous wage structure which just isn't going to work when trying to get top talent.

"politics","t5_2cneq","We don't have a pure free market.  We have limits on what businesses can do.

We have a controlled/limited free market. The market is free within the rules that apply to every business.  It is better than free because it prevents businesses from harming people just to make a buck, but keeps all the good aspects competition provides.

&gt;some employees might not generate more than say, $5 an hour, and so their labour is only worth $5 an hour.

It does not work that way.  If you need an employee to work 40 hours a week for your business to exist, you have to pay them the amount they need to live at the most basic level.  If you can't figure out a way for your business to exist while paying a livable minimum wage, then your business doesn't work.  It is an invalid business.

At any level of minimum wage, you are always going to have business fail that weren't ran well enough to survive a minimum wage increase.  We don't want businesses that require exploiting labor to make up for bad management.","1375316254"

I highly recommend going with a mechanical keyboard, they feel a lot better than traditional membrane keyboards. I like brown switches, but blue switches are also nice (they can be a bit loud, though). I prefer the tactile feedback that both switches provide, but reds and blacks would be good if you don't like feedback. If you don't mind a tenkeyless keyboard (no number pad on the right), the [CM Storm Quickfire Rapid](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823129007) ($70) is a cheaper alternative to the Pro. 

In short, mechanical keyboards feel so much more well built and comfortable to use than membrane keyboards. Not sure if it really matters in your choice between keyboard types, but switching to mechanical keyboards marginally improved my wpm (words per minute) by a whole lot; it bumped me up from around 105 wpm to around 115 wpm.

Do I know what numbers are? Yes... Can I match numbers? Yeah! Congratulations... Heres your $12/hour warehouse/shipping job. 

You can't really bitch about making $7/hour when you have the skills of a 10 year old. I mean honestly... My son beat Tekken 3 at 4 years old. That is nothing but pushing a button to get an outcome. Thats all a fast food job is. 

You dont need math. You don't need skills. You literally push the picture of what the customer wants and a picture comes up in the back of what to put on the sandwich. 

You could LITERALLY train a 5 year old to do it. 

Is it sad that not everyone is smarter than a 5 year old? Sure... Should we as a society do something about it. Hell yes! Is raising the cost of living for everyone on earth to pay for the lazy and stupid worth it? 

No... no not really. 

These are jobs meant for teenagers and invalids with the amount that teenagers (see invalids) breed these days there in no lack of applicants. 

It ends up costing us more because we don't have the social structure to put a stop to the main problem. Meanwhile we have a class of assholes who take advantage of the whole debacle like somehow they are going to be buried with their money and its going to get them into heaven or they leave it behind for there now invalid and stupid teenagers who have no earthly idea what the real world is like to throw it around and influence more bad behavior.

Rolling the ball to a teammate in any live play context would be a pass, I don't see any rational reason why it wouldn't suffice for any dead ball play.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Machiavellianism is some seriously depressing and real stuff. I took a class in my senior year of college that focused on him, here is a crash course in Machiavelli.

Machiavallianism is defined as the personal and political teaching which denies the morality to politics, and further claims that manipulation and deceit are often necessary and justified in the acquisition and maintenance of (political) power.

The Ancient-Modern debate centers around the role that morality and virtue plays in the conduct of political affairs. The original reason for bringing philosophy to politics (Socrates, Plato, etc) was to make politics more just and to help human beings become BETTER people.

The Modern debate will say that politics has NOTHING to do with morality. You do not have to be a good person to be a good ruler. As a matter of fact, the more ""moral"" you are the more ineffective you will be as a ruler. In your own moral hesitancy as a leader, your enemy will surely run you over.

Machiavelli was deeply suspicious of the Ancient/Modern perspective and what the Christian's called God. He thought, if there is no truth or god, we are left with the here and the now. It's a dangerous, chaotic, violent, and unpredictable place.  Machiavelli spoke highly of the separation of politics and religion (church and state).  

Machiavelli wrote ""The Prince"" in order to make society run safe and run properly. Also, because he had a problem. His problem was he needed to set a new way of acting and thinking after previously destroying ancient ways of acting and thinking. The context determines what is good and bad. If the ends justify the means and the ends are always changing, then so must the means. In writing ""The Prince"" he wanted to invent someone who could represent the way he thought a leader must act and behave. Because of the constantly changing world, you can't just rely on what you know. There will be a time where you need to be creative and display an act of virtuoso (master of one's craft, game changer). This was ""The Prince"". A prince can be thought of as a virtuoso-an expert at what you do and possess an innate talent to change things, often in times of crisis (FDR and The New Deal). What does something so drastic and life-changing bring someone like FDR? Glory... and well, all princes have glory. 

Lastly, I thought it was interesting that in the text of ""The Prince"", Machiavelli talks about how, ""The Prince must use the beast with arms"", or the Centaur. The half-man half-beast represents the devil and ruins every conception of what it is like to be human (a unique faculty to reason and talk about justice, virtue, etc). He has literally blurred the line between human and animal. He goes on to suggest we are nothing but mere animals with intelligence. The Centaur is a hooved beast very much so portrayed as Satan. Machiavelli says you have to be BAD, and learn how to be an ANIMAL. Specifically, he mentions two animals: the lion and the fox. 

Lion-instills fear, backs it up with a certain ferocity. Not afraid to use it's power or intimidation. Lions have no guilt.

Fox-quick to act on feet. Very duplicitous and doesn't show it's self (appears good). 

And in the end, it is not necessary for The Prince to have all of those qualities, rather to appear to. 

Machiavellians of our time include Bill Clinton, Lance Armstrong, Charlie Sheen, and Kobe Bryant.

&gt; Hercules, son of the Greek God, Zeus, is turned into a half-god, half-mortal by evil Hades, God of the Underworld, who plans to overthrow Zeus. Hercules is raised on Earth and retains his god-like strength, but when he discovers his immortal heritage Zeus tells him that to return to Mount Olympus he must become a true hero. Hercules becomes a famous hero with the help of his friend Pegasus and his personal trainer, Phil the satyr. Hercules battles monsters, Hades and the Titans, but it is his self-sacrifice to rescue his love Meg which makes him a true hero.

I can picture a future where these companies decided to pay more and many Redditors have now moved on from these jobs and college into the real world of work.

After a few years of very low stock growth in their 401k they take to Reddit or its future equivalent to gripe about the fact that they can never retire because there isn't enough growth in the market.  They then push to cut the minimum wage so they can eat something other than ramen in retirement.

Most companies are heavily invested into and controlled by retirement funds.  Those retirement funds belong to unions and mutual fund companies.  These large investors can easily control these companies because they command BILLIONS to invest that will stay put for years.  Any one or two individuals have no control no matter how rich they are.  Warren Buffet and Bill Gates could team up and have at most $100 billion to invest to influence companies but that is a drop in the bucket.

But I do know: (1) OP doesn't want kids; (2) OP's girlfriend does; (3) OP's girlfriend stopped taking birth control and is angry that he won't have sex with her; (4) having sex with someone who isn't on birth control increases the risks of pregnancy and the odds are that if she gets pregnant, she's keeping the kid. 

The risk to be foreseen defines the duty owed - this woman wants a kid and it's important for him that he not become a father at this point.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I read that one of the reasons Michael Phelps had a huge caloric excess was so his body could maintain its core temperature during swimming in the cold water. 

We know that exercise is linked to a longer lifespan in humans, at least one where the quality of life is increased at later ages. This is thought to be due to better control of oxidative stress, which damages nucleic acids and other components of the cell.

Exercise can induce the levels of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) which utilise the cell's energy in a futile cycle, producing heat instead of ATP (The principal energy molecule). UCPs bypass the step where a majority of the damaging oxidative molecules are produces. Athletes have higher resting rates of metabolism, but are more 'tuned' to avoid much of the damage from oxidative stress through UCP utilisation.

Mammals are endotherms so must maintain their core body temperature within certain limits. To raise the body temperature, metabolism is raised and some of this energy input is towards the actions of UCPs. These UCPs are primarily found in Brown Adipose Tissue, and their activation allows hibernating mammals to periodically arouse.

It would make sense then that in cooler climates, the body must generate more heat through UCPs, which will increase their activity, and perhaps bypassing the creation of a portion of oxidative molecules. Over time this would maybe lead to a modest decrease in oxidative damage, allowing your cells to live longer, and hence, your body.

To increase lifespan, the only proven ways are exercise and caloric restriction. 
Also, the extract from the plant *Rhodiola rosea* was shown to increase lifespan in fruit flies by around 20%, independent of caloric restriction.

This and the monologue at the beginning of the film were the two issues I had with it. It felt more like the explanation of scavs and the war was supposed to be revealed to the audience when it was revealed to the survivor.

Overall, both of these reasons and a few others made it feel like it was sci-fi (for lack of a better term) dumbed down.

That's possibly true. Opposition to one's view tends to make one hold that view more tightly. On the other hand, the presence of vocal opposition gives people confidence to not follow their religion.

"eldertrees","t5_2tclf","I grew up in DC, so I will take a moment to educate everyone about the governmental situation down there.

Washington DC is governed by both the Federal government, and a local city government. The city laws are governed by a city council, which consists of representatives elected from several districts within DC. This city council is the body which passed the original Medical Marijuana bill 15 years ago. There is also a mayor of DC, like in any other city. He signed this bill into law.

The federal government, i.e. Congress, is allowed to pass laws which specifically govern Washington DC. This is different than their power over states, because they do not write laws to specifically govern any particular state or city other than DC. These laws which they pass for DC are usually good things: they approve funding for public works projects in DC, they provide funding to the museums in DC, and other ordinary things like that. After the MMJ bill was passed by the city council, Congress passed a law that would essentially stall the MMJ bill into ever being implemented, even though it was legitimately voted on and approved by the city council.

Now here's where it gets controversial: DC does not have any representative in Congress. Congress is allowed to directly govern Washington DC, but Washington DC does not get any say in the matter at all. Not a single voice. Every single US Congressman and Senator is from a state outside of DC, and yet they get to make decisions about DC. That means there is no DC resident who is even allowed to submit a bill to committee in Congress. DC is forced to have its voice heard in Congress only through lobbying and partnerships.","1375316276"

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","South East San Diego, right off of Skyline, commonly referred as ""the hood"". In the early 90s there used to be a lot of gang activity running around, but it's a lot calmer these days. I attribute it to a lot of people either dead or in jail. Still the occasional knucklehead running around. Lot of Filipinos/asians, blacks and Mexicans in the area. This area usually makes the news for the occasional stabbing/shooting/abandoned baby at Meadowbrook apartments. About a month ago there was a SWAT standoff in Paradise Hills. It sounds a lot worse than it really is. Anyone from area would probably agree with me. Lots of good Mexican food scattered around. Also there's a [Vallarta Supermarket](http://www.vallartasupermarkets.com/) close by. Best place to grab some marinated meats for your bbq. [Conchings](http://www.conchings.com/) is just around the way if you want some Filipino food, it was also feature on Bizarre Foods. All in all, its a pretty diverse area.

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","True. I would like tocounter with a few points though.

What happens when September 1st rolls around and we signed no one?

Because then there would be little excuse. Regardless of how the market is, you have to play the market. I understand not buying in January because prices were too high, or not replacing Van Persie last summer because the United deal came too close to the end of the window to find a replacement.  Its harder, but I also understand not buying 2 summers ago because of a lack of talent.

What I do not countenance is those three windows one after another when players are bought last minute, and after demonstrated fact that cash rich teams spend big we don't try to pip them to a player at the beginning of the window. I can understand isolated issues caused by a unique market, but at some point you have to learn from the market.

Nobody ever got rich from complaining that the economy wasn't quite conducive enough to work in. 

Like you say, its hard to blame the club for Higuain when from most accounts, the goalposts were moved by Real Madrid. But its the club's fault for not looking ahead. What on earth did they think would happen with the transfer window? To say that there aren't enough World class strikers is a bullshit excuse. There never are. That's why they're called ""world class"". 

This is something I'm so sure that we had to have known before the beginning of the window that I'm more and more beginning to believe that the club is working under an unknown force(be it profit skimming by Kronke, revenue hoarding by the club, or just a plain lack of funds) that restricts spending and that fans are being kept in the dark from.

This is because there's no way you look at this market and not realise right off the bat that if you want to talk sweet shit like challenging for trophies you ***HAVE*** to pay inflated prices for even *diamonds in the rough*, talk less of world class players.

To conclude, few people also like to propose the idea that if we sign a player and he doesn't work out, then we lose money. I'd like to counter that by saying that we also lose money even with bargain buys. Transfer are not an exact science. However, players *tend* to play to their fee. A player bought for &gt;20mil will normally play like the World Class player that he is. Sometimes players play above their fee(bargain buys) and sometimes they play below it(flops) but that happens. It should not stop us for paying(even slightly over paying) for players that the fans, the manager and the scouting team believe would massively improve the team.","1375316281"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well my sophomore year I had a huge crush on this chick in my Chem class, really the only girl to this day Ive ever liked that much right after meeting her. She was a grade above me and I was good friends with her brother due to the football team.

Anyway since this was the first girl I really liked that much I was always nervous. After a while I gt an idea that maybe she liked me back and that I should ask her out because after a while it seemed shed always be where I was, show up at the gym after school on the same days to work out, etc...Of course I talked to one of my friends about it after constant nagging from her and she proceeded to tell me that this chick I liked was ""kinda a whore and a bitch."" Thus I was put off from asking her out. Last day of that year I remember walking out thinking that I should have done it anyway.

So my Junior year, her senior year things were calm for the first month of two, then some facebook statuses of her were saying things that fit in extremely well of what happened last year. One time after school let out I was walking out and she was right behind me although I didnt know it, and as we exited she tripped and fell into me and we talked for a bit until the buses left, now where she tripped there was nothing but flat floor so I should have taken that as a hint but didnt because I was scared.

Eventually at the end of the year she would be 5 ft from my locker everyday right as I had to get my math book, be it by herself or with some friends or a large group of friends. I remember looking at her through the slits at the top of the locker on the last day of her senior year looking gorgeous standing there with a friend, not even looking at her friend but straight at me and I just left to go to class.

Looking back on it I can tell how oblivious I was because I still doubted she liked me for some reason. The fact that I was pretty chubby and awkward and generally ""uncool"" while she was the opposite was likely the reason I didnt have the nerve to ask her out. Although I guess its a good thing it happened, taught me alot about life, Im in better shape, less awkward and I realize how to read subtlety now and that I shouldnt waste both time for both others and myself.

TL;DR Im was and Idiot but now Im not (I think)","1375316283"

And how valuable the use of that arm is to you. A singer, for example, might get his voice insured so that if he can no longer sing, he can get some kind of compensation due to the loss of his livelihood. Chances are that you or I would not get the same payout as, say, Bruce Springsteen ($6.2 million) as our voices are not as valuable to us as his is to him.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I generally liked having pawns, especially the ability to change them easily, but i also had some frustrations with the AI. I thought it needed to give players more control over what the pawns were actually doing, both immediately on the field and with generally being able to change their tactics. It would've been possible to keep the feeling of being in direct control only of your PC while actually letting players issue commands or set tactics.

Changing pawn AI tactics was a chore and the results were vague at best.  I thought they really missed an opportunity to employ something like the FFXII gambit system (specifying an action to take in a given scenario and its priority against other actions), even if only for your main pawn.  That way you'd be able to change your pawn's tactics a bit more meaningfully, and actually have a record of what they were.

Also, often I'd find that pawns wouldn't respond to the simple orders you were able to give them (""come""/""go""/""help""), and that they weren't very useful anyway. I thought it would be better if you were able to access a quick menu and issue individual commands to each pawn. Something along the lines of Dragon Age/Mass Effect, except being more general ""attack""/""heal""/""flee"" instructions instead of micromanaging.  Hopefully this would stop some of the more frustrating moments.

I had a real problem with using sorcerer pawns, since this class is a bit more tactical and pawns have pea-brains.  The long cast time (20s or more) and easy interruption meant getting a spell off was a challenge from the get go, but they tended to make it worse for themselves.  They'd always pick the strongest (and hence slowest) version of each spell and instead of standing safely at a distance and casting, they'd run up to the melee zone and get interrupted constantly.  Sometimes a pawn would just stop mid-cast and change position for no apparent reason.  Made them frustrating bordering on useless in some scenarios.

Apart from that, just a failure of pawns to target weak spots on big enemies.  Playing a magical character it can be a pain to get any damage on Iron golem floating tokens because they have high magic resist and pawns would just attack the main body.","1375316287"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;you pretty much seem clueless and just defensive about some perceived bias against you. 

I'm not American.  I'm Canadian.  I grew up in Canada.  Growing up in Canada I was taught that Americans are assholes, living in America is like living in a third world country unless you're Bill Gates, everyone in America is either a slack jawed yokel or an evangelical Christian, etc.  There IS a bias against Americans. Every Canadian I know feels superior to Americans.  My parents are a great example.  They come to visit me here in America and every time they see an American flag or somebody wearing a t-shirt that says ""USA"" they have to comment on how stupid Americans are.  **Even though they bring their CANADA t-shirts with them and wear them everywhere**. 

&gt;When I lived in the states, I couldn't go two houses without seeing an American flag. I couldn't see a single tall building, public or private, without several flags hanging from it. 

I have been to the south and there is no arguing that there are a lot of American flags there and people are patriotic - but I have friends with Canadian flags on their walls and in their windows - I've never heard anybody call them stupid for hanging a Canadian flag. 

&gt;And if you don't think Europeans shit on their country, you are blind as a bat. 

I went back and clarified this in my OP.  I'm at work so I didn't re read what I wrote and I wrote it while talking.  I'm talking about publicly.  When I travel with my American friends, they will either tell people they're Canadian, or happily agree with foreigners that America is a terrible country with a corrupt government that's full of stupid evangelicals.  Foreign nationals in other countries put on Greek fests and Lebanese fests and Oktoberfests and just generally enjoy celebrating their country and culture and sharing it with their adoptive country.  Try organizing an ""America day"" in a foreign country and see how many people are interested in going there, learning about American culture and singing American folk songs.  Oktoberfest here in LA is full of people who aren't German that are there to learn about and celebrate German culture with the German expats.  Nobody criticizes people for wanting to celebrate their culture in America, but fuck Americans if they want to celebrate their own country amirite?


&gt;Even college professors would randomly drone on about how superior the U.S. was in a manner related to their subject, yet show a stunning ignorance of what was actually going on in those other countries.

For the record, I went to college in Canada and in America, and Canadian college professors are just as ignorant about America as Americans can be about other countries.  It's perfectly normal for a person who lives in Cambodia to not know a lot about people who live in Namibia.  Why are Americans expected to know everything about every foreign country, and if they don't know, they are ignorant?  I bet there are lots of things going on in America that you are ignorant of, but that doesn't mean you're an ignorant person, it means you're not exposed to that stuff.  I don't see anything wrong with not knowing all of the relevant information about a country you don't live in that you probably won't ever even visit. 

&gt; Do you have ANY clue how effected the rest of the planet is by the U.S.?

Yes.  I lived outside of America for twenty four years.  I was raised to hate America, too, and to call Americans ignorant and hate them for their blind, foolish ignorance.  Then I moved here and learned that most Americans are kind, thoughtful and reasonably intelligent individuals.  They were not at all like I was told they are. Americans are no different than Canadians in terms of friendliness or helpfulness.  I think you don't realize how brainwashed you are to hate Americans, because I certainly was brainwashed to hate Americans growing up in Canada.

&gt;How about the fact that your government considers itself the world police, and through economic power forces its' ""allies"" into wars they don't want and never asked for

Honestly I'm really wondering whether or not you even read my post. I made it clear I'm not American and I'm not defending the government.  I'm defending Americans. 

&gt;Catastrophe after catastrophe caused by oil companies, safe from prosecution due to their influence with the U.S. government. U.S. pharmaceutical companies screwing over thousands of people who are dying of curable diseases because they're afraid of their bottom line getting hit - while raking in millions of personal gain in salaries, bonuses and dividends.

Oh  you're right.  I never noticed it before but it's *only* American companies that have unsavory business practices.  I mean it's not like BP has ever  done anything wrong.  It's like I totally forgot that only American companies are evil.  Silly me. 


&gt;Or how about the quality of life consistently being lowered for a large majority of your country through constantly lowered wages (Keeps up with inflation and productivity my ass), less security in the form of health insurance and public services/social safety nets. Do you think that neoliberalism isn't being exported to the rest of the planet? It most definitely is, and we're being strongarmed into accepting it by your government.

Well now you're just criticizing the country as a whole.  I never said America was perfect or even a great country.  I'm defending American patriots, not America itself.  You're off topic here. 

&gt;The constitution only shields Americans and the constitution is holy in the eyes of a large majority of your country, but fuck the foreigners - the constitution never gave them any rights, right?

I am a foreigner and I am protected by the constitution.  I'm not a citizen but I have never been denied my rights.  America has an illegal immigrant problem, but IMO illegal immigrants aren't entitled to the same rights as citizens and legal immigrants because they broke the fucking law.  I got in line, paid my money, worked my ass off and waited YEARS to get in here the right way.  I don't have any sympathy for someone who doesn't follow the rules. 

&gt;You want to know why your patriotism is cringeworthy? Because it's not just a misplaced or ironic sense of pride, it is a completely normal and accepted idea that you are more ""human"" than people around the globe if you're American,

That is just patently false.  Americans are well known for their giving nature in times of crisis in their country and outside of their country.  You criticize America for getting involved in foreign affairs, and that's fair, but what about the fact that the American military is there for countries in their times of need as well?  The American military does much more than just kill foreigners. 

&gt;It's different to have a Canadian flag because it is extremely rare for the Canadians to start shouting they're the greatest country on the planet. It is tradition for Americans do it.

Clearly you have never been to Canada on Canada day.  It's pretty fucking sickening how stupid patriotic Canadians can be. 

&gt;Watch a sporting event. Listen to your national anthem. Or better yet, think of the freedom bullshit that's spouted every goddamn day.

I don't hear freedom bullshit getting spouted every god damn day.  In fact when I attended college here (I transferred from a Canadian institution) the vast majority of discussion was about the problems in America.  In years here I have never encountered an American who really believes America is the most free and great country in the world.  Americans are perfectly well aware of the fact that their country has some serious problems.  

&gt;To Americans, disagreeing with their view makes you less than them.

Again, patently false.  As I said before, my inlaws from Europe love to tell my American friends what's wrong with America, and I've never heard  my friends say anything to them except that they're right.  

&gt;By the way, patriotism is nowhere NEAR as common in any country on the planet I've seen as it is in the US. Not even in China where the government tries to force it down your throat. By a large fucking margin too.

Again, in my experience this is simply not true.  I have not encountered a great deal of patriotism from my American friends here. I'm sure it's different in the bible belt, but every country has its idiots.  You are making sweeping generlizations about a country that contains three hundred million people, and they're just not true.

Never was really trusting. Got into a relationship, was different than any of my previous ones. First person I've ever trusted 100%. Gave my virginity. Fell in love.

Didn't really understand that you do those things in a relationship because you like them and *want* to, not because it's some mandatory ritual.

That's one of the elements that *did* make it into the  Hague Convention... merely having *a* valid military purpose is not justification to launch an attack, the expected collateral damage must be 'proportional' to the military result that could be achieved.

So a strike that could be expected to kill one of AQ's genius bomb makers might be legal even if you *knew* a noncombatant might also die, but certainly would not be at the cost of 50 noncombatants. (Edit: Apparently forgot to throw the number in there)

The logic of banning any action that would lead to an 'expectation' of noncombatant deaths gets hairy quick though... coal power plant workers operate the plant *knowing* that people will eventually die from the air pollution. Fire chiefs send firemen into building fires knowing that they will eventually have one (or more) die on the job.

"TheBluePill","t5_2vzvv","Re RPW:

There are a few women on there, but not many. In terms of belief, a couple of the women are simply insane (advocating the end of suffrage for women and black people type of thing). Most of the others have an internal struggle with the fact that they can clearly see and feel they are people, and yet TRP doesn't let them be people. RPW exists basically because whenever women posted in the main group, the response from the really bitter guys there was too negative. RPW presents a softer version. You won't typically find the women on there declaring themselves to be gold-digging children, it's more focused on worshipping the alpha male of their lives and deriding other women as sluts. 

Half of RPW is just good relationship advice - 'do nice things for your guy and don't argue over nothing' (well no fucking shit). Unfortunately they then back it up with 'if you've ever momentarily failed to be a good partner or hurt someone, it was because women are intrinsically stupid and evil and you need to repent, on your knees, while sucking off the nearest alpha'. Essentially.

They also perform a lot of hamster spins about why being a slut is bad despite the lack of actual reasons for this claim.","1375316300"

She was trying to be a productive member of society, while living with the aftermath of a psychotic break. And instead of being allowed to do that, she got fired and is being ridiculed for having a mental illness that - from what I got from the article - is under control.

If she was working at a daycare or something it might be a little different, but she was a cashier at walmart. She isn't even allowed to have the most basic of jobs because she is mentally ill.

This is a terrifying and very real fear for anyone with a mental illness. As soon as your employer finds out, you could be fired. How are you supposed to afford treatment if society tells you you aren't allowed to have a job or be around people?

That's why our society is so backwards when it comes to gay rights. Plus, as the Soviet system collapsed, the Church began to regain influence and it became trendy to wear a cross and act Orthodox, whether you actually believed it or not.

Then you'll have to present a much more stronger argument—especially since the beginning of human personhood is such a controversial topic.

&gt; The benefits to the parents outweigh the costs to the child.

Which—again—assumes that being a burden on someone gives you the right to terminate their life. You're still left with the consequence of being able to terminate persons outside of the category of ""unfit children"". It reduces to absurdity.

&gt; While an unfit child child will lose their life this will more than be made up for this loss by the birth of the fit sibling. An unfit child will not pass along their genes but a fit sibling will.

Can you explain why passing on genes is something that supersedes the life of an unfit child? With our current standing, humans are not subjected to natural selection the way that other animals are.

Okay, well that's not really the same as saying that malnutrition in the US is causing measurable loss in IQ.

Yeah every time I've thought about a kitten or back to when I got my kittens I've always felt guilty about getting one instead of adopting an older pet. I really like the experience of raising from young to old. I wish I could give them all homes though.

I really don't know how Ember would react to an older cat. I feel she got along well with Joey (at last from Ember's side) because Joey was already there and it was all Joey's territory and Ember became accustomed to being in it. Never really seen anything that would give hint to her reaction of an unfamiliar cat coming into hers. I'll talk to the shelter about it though.

I remember when my sister texted me back when she found Ember, she'd said that she wasn't cute in the traditional sense. Like the pictures you'd see all over /r/aww . I can see what she meant, but I felt Ember was beautiful and perfect. But I was glad to give her a home when her brothers and sisters were more likely to be adopted first, especially since Ember wasn't as friendly with strangers.

And thanks! She is so pretty and much prettier in person because her dark colors makes it hard to get a good photo of her. ","1375316314"

The other thing pointed out that I love is that she just might have a low libido. I am LL and I feel like I'm not giving him enough and when we have sex it's about making him cum. Its just as frustrating as a HL and I would say a sex therapist would be a great place to start.

  Also have her learn to masterbate. Get an egg bullet that does 7 speeds, I have one I love. It comes in silver or black. And the bullet is like headphone jack into the switch so I can try the few different ones they make to fit it. Have her just lay on her back and rub around her clit. You don't need to be there, because then its a show and she'll feel pressured to look and sound sexy for you. Maybe it'll work, maybe not. If it does, we do a move where I lay on the edge of the bed and he stands, I use my vibrator and he gets a blow job. It's awkward at first but it works. It's nice actually.

Especially, at the freshman level where I assume there's little to no scouting this will either completely take the team by surprise or occupy the majority of their pre-game prep. Two desired outcomes. Either way having a freshman ST unit that just understands their assignment and execute can be extremely effective.

You can read the speeches they gave on the Senate floor where they said they had reservations but were willing to give the President the benefit of the doubt. That's not what the Republicans are doing under Obama - they want to stop him from doing anything, and to that end they're even creating crises like the debt ceiling and sequester.

"Slender_Man","t5_2s4md","I feel like beating a dead horse but let me bring this up one more time...

I have the theory that the EMH guys live in another ""timezone"" like we or every other ARGs, even the ones they did crossovers with (read my full post  [here](http://de.reddit.com/r/Slender_Man/comments/1j4x4c/a_proposal_everymanhybrid/)). In short, I think that the time goes a lot slower in the EMH ""timezone"".

So, what do we know? In TT, HABIT allready appeared in the [DEUS EX MACHINA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-Vg7oCZvlA) video. He released Firebrand out of the Administrators custody because of ""mutual interests"", whatever that means.

My first thought while watching this was: ""Wait a second, I thought that Evan wasn't inHABITed anymore?"". I couldn't stop thinking about it, but EMH's [A proposal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RethrGcU6w) video gave me a clue and [A summoning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY6yH6Odmh4) finally opened my eyes: 
EMH is actually in another timezone. What allready happened in TT, like the freeing of Firebrand by HABIT is just about to happen in EMH. Vinnie and Evan summoned the HABIT and now, the HABIT is on a loose again (it's not like we fucking TOLD them this is a bad idea). 

Now look at [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY6yH6Odmh4#t=09m40s). 

HABIT says: "" Well Vinnie... we might have guests"".

So, HABIT released Firebrand because of ""mutual interests"", huh? Looks like Firebrand is visiting Vinnie if you ask me. 

I wonder what kind of personality Firebrands has? Will he be some kind of crazy, fucked up version of Noah, like HABIT is of Evan? After all he went through, it wouldn't be suprising, now would it?

EDIT: I have the urge to add something here, about the other ARGs and possible crossovers:

* Marble Hornets: In [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGeGuxp5s9c#t=17m11s) interview Troy Wagner pointed out, that MH is in it's final season, it's allready written and a crossover would just mess up the storyline. In short: no crossovers in the MH universe/dimension.

* DarkHarvest00: Well, they allready did a [crossover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6pSZBXnAAs) with TT (btw [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKJw4t5nubU) is what happened to Noah while meeting The Order) and they did a [cameo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoUUF5hK20s#t=00m58s) in EMH. Plus, their last update was 2 months ago... let's let them start a new ""season"" before thinking about another crossover.

* MLAndersen: Holy shit, are these guys still alive? They haven't [updated](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skOJlKwmowk) in what... 4 months? Sorry folks... this series seems dead to me. No need to think about a crossover.

* CaughtNotSleeping: I never get tired to mention, that this is the most underestimated series of all time. But, as well as I appreciate their latest [update](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Zt3oi-VPc), it's allready 3 months old. I hope Caught has an idea how to continue this series. It would be a shame to just let it die with this cliffhanger, but also: Caught isn't really a people person, so I don't think his character would fit with other ARGs.

And yes, I'm aware that Marble Hornets once did a 7 months break. I wasn't into the series at this time (yes, I'm another ""kiddo"" who first met the Slender Man in Mark Hadley's ""Slender: The Eight Pages"", gimme a break) but I think that was pretty ""adventurous"" of them. Yes, it worked, but it could have meant to dead of the channel. ARGs shouldn't took a break like that, in my humble opinion.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I definitely don't hate fruit, though I particularly hate durians, haha. I think the phrase ""I hate math"" for me holds the same connotations as ""I hate DOING math."" Understanding how math helps make the world work is mind bogglingly awesome. Actually following through, though is akin to doing manual labor to me. The end product is rewarding to me but getting there is so tedious that I tend to avoid it.

That's just me though. :)

Edit to add:  I thought a little bit of what you were saying about imagination and creativity.  I think I apply those same concepts with equal enthusiasm to art. A lot of the time art is seen as requiring little skill or understanding, like ""I draw a pretty picture and that makes me creative."" There is a lot to actually learn about biology, anatomy, perspective, how light refraction and reflection effects color, and a dozen other things that people apply in actual science every day. It's just a different method of appreciating the world around you. I had a 4.0 in school but I could definitely tell you that art held way more wonders and fascinations than math ever did to me.

The board trusts in Arsene, and rightfully so.  Arsene is the last of the SAF type managers that truly manage the whole club, he's not just worried about winning or making fans happy.  He cares about the longevity of the club, and is doing a very good job of ensuring it.

Arsene is cocky enough to think he can get the club where it needs to be without spending absurd amounts of money, and if you can do it without spending...why spend?  Look at Pennant, Diawara, Francis Jeffers, Reyes, Hleb, Arshavin etc.  Maybe the club have realized that under Arsene, spending big doesn't always pay off.","1375316329"

When you have it nicely round you can switch to a gouge, but leave the skew alone until you gain some experience. Above all else, keep your tools sharp.

That's sort of the problem with Good Game. I've said this before, but there's a huge conflict between their supposed audience and what they want to say about the medium. They're shown on a national television show, and I think this comes with a preconceived notion of who is going to watch the show. They often market things to either 'brogamers' (according to popular media the only type of gamer that exists in Australia) or the general public and this rarely offers them the chance to go into great depth on any topic.

I shot a 9mm before I picked up my .40 and frankly the difference seemed inconsequential. Perhaps someday ammo prices will come back down, I'll get bored, and pick up a 9mm. Maybe not.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt; I simply can't accept that there is absolutely no existence of any deity, God, or higher power.

Atheism is a lack of belief in gods, not necessarily a belief in a lack of gods.

&gt; Atheism itself just seems like the lack of understanding that it's scientifically-possible a God could exist beyond our knowledge and instead take the lazy route of ruling it out.

I see how you come to that conclusion, since your definition of atheism is wrong. It may not be impossible that a god exists, but that doesn't automatically mean it's possible.

---

[This example](http://www.ex-christian.net/blog/189/entry-822-what-is-possible/) is taken from The Atheist Experience #814, the bag of dice example of possibilities: Let's say I have a bag. You can't see what I have in the bag. There's nothing uncommon about this bag. I ask you if I can roll a 21 with the dice that I have in my bag. You say, ""It's possible"". I then open my bag to reveal that I have one normal, six sided die,which has one number on each side, numbering 1 through 6. Is it possible to roll a 21 with this die? No. So, it was not possible to roll a 21, but you have already declared something possible that was, in fact, impossible. Wouldn't it have been more correct to say that without knowing what's in the bag (one die, several dice ... no dice), that we don't have enough information to make a declaration one way or another?

First off being gold V will put you in the top 15% of players or so, as you say you've recently dinged 30 do you consider yourself to be better than 85% of the playerbase?

Don't become another one of those IM BRONZE BECAUSE MY TEAM SUCKS I SHOULD BE PLAT players.

Right onto HELPING! 

Realize your own mistakes, you died? its -NEVER- your team mates fault - consider what you could of done better in that situation and improve on it 

Don't rage - 90% of silver / bronze games lost are down to raging like a 2 year old when something goes tits up, congratulate people on good plays ""shit happens"" when something goes bad.  

CS (creep score) - Practice this to fuck, it may not seem so important but in bronze games i've seen people averaging about 50-120cs by the 20 minute mark, if you can get 100 more cs than your lane opponent you're up 2-3k gold (consider you get 300g a kill)

WARDS! - 75 / 125g  a piece!? expensive right!? NOPE! they will prevent the enemy team getting 300g when the jungler inevitably ganks you and will provide you with the vision needed to take advantage of those who are out of place


There is tons of little things you can always do better - if you want advice on anything specific just ask and maybe i can help :)

2.) Re-assessing the problem facing me and taking some tactical strategy to resolve/fix it. 

3.) If it's a problem I ""can't solve"" for some reason.. Then I try to ""let it go""

"EnoughPaulSpam","t5_2sir4","&gt; That's a disingenuous assertion and you know it. There's no specific option to decline the question as having no opinion -- so saying ""keep it the same"" is quite obviously going to include that group.

Source for accusation that those people simply had no opinion on the matter?

&gt;You also would want to look up the definition of ""majority"" -- Rand is with the plurality on the poll -- there is no majority.

The majority polled who didn't want to see a decrease in foreign aid. Hell, the title of that poll even mentions it. 

&gt;Exactly -- and of places to cut government spending -- foreign aid typically is at the top (in the number 1 position in this poll). Even Democrats[1]
&gt;understand the need for spending cuts overall -- why not start with the most popular thing to cut?

Except your poll showed most people weren't for a decrease in foreign aid. What you mean to say is ""more people were for a decrease in foreign aid than in any other category"". And yeah, that makes sense. People are tribalistic; we generally care more about those in our own borders then anywhere else.

But most people still remember that ""foreign aid"" ranges from providing vaccines in Pakistan, to paying for Israel to buy our weapons, to providing for disaster victims. So cutting that means you're still inevitably taking away from beneficial programs, as well as the bad ones.

Paulbots of course have no filter and so consider any foreign assistance to be bad. Thing is, the polls also show most people are for spending money to care for the poor at home, and well, we all know how you guys feel about that.","1375316344"

My point is, you can't expect her to know what to get you if she asks and you don't give her any ideas. It is annoying when you can't think of something so you ask for some inspiration etc and they blow you off. My guess is that she took your response (or lack thereof) as an indication that there was nothing you were truly interested in. As for the party, I'm sure she really just didn't think people would show up. 

Harboring resentment is useless. You need to bring it up to her. I know she will get defensive and angry and blame it on you, but in her head she will think about it deeper than that. So bring it up.

Honestly, there was not very much the western Allies could have done without another five years of war. That's what you get for trusting Stalin, but you need to look at it from the strategic context of the time (1942): Nazi Germany and Japan were at the height of their power, and an ally was needed on the continent who could actively engage German forces in battle.

He didn't mind the dog so much as he did the cats, he sat in one of the litter boxes (we had 3 btw 1 for each cat) and yowled something fierce. The next move was easier we moved to our own apartment with no other animals. I lived at this apartment for 7+ years to say he was attached was an understatement. When I married my husband and we finally moved to a house he hid under the couch for approximately 8 hours. After that he was totally fine, I think he was hiding more under the couch because of the movers. Anyways just make sure you show him where his litter and food is and he will eventually come around.

I have products with color attributes, and I wanted to make it so that when you selected a color from the drop down menu, the picture would automatically change. 

For better or worse, they way I handled this was by appending a color name to the end of every product image, and I upload one image for every color option. So my naming convention is sku_colorName.jpg.

So, when someone selects an option from the color drop down, I use javascript to replace the main image. And I know the corresponding image exists at /path/to/image/sku_colorNameTheySelected.jpg.  

Right now I'm pulling that image from its static location on the server, not the cached version. But we're already pulling in the cached versions for use as the option images anyways, so it seems like it would just make more sense to target the cached version with my custom code. That way I'm not loading in two versions of the exact same thing.  ","1375316349"

TRT works too. Understand there is a risk to everything, including these. However, closely monitored TRT is probably the best thing the medical community could possibly offer to older athletes in my opinion.

I come from the boxing world, and the majority of pro fighters have some kind of hormonal problems as they age that can manifest itself in depression, muscle loss/fat gain, and all sorts of shit.

Personally, I am given Clomid from my doctor for lower levels and it works for me. If your testosterone has been more shut down than mine, or if you are over 60, Clomid does not work very well.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I think you're very wrong about how children in general don't understand ""why"". 

When I was little, my parents would always try to explain why something couldn't be done. If I wanted a toy that my parents couldn't afford, I was told that and that I could get it later. It was something I remember finding very easy to accept, despite seeing other kids in similar situations throwing tantrums when they were simply told, ""no.""

Also, a lot of these lessons that you mention are good for children to learn by themselves.

&gt; Don't touch the hot part of the stove. 

In my country we have a saying that roughly translates to, ""Burnt child shuns fire"". Like my mother would say, ""Go ahead. Try it! I dare you.""

&gt; Don't eat too much chocolate (haha)... 

Why not? So the child gets an upset stomach... Who hasn't eaten too much of something only to learn that it was a bad idea? Wouldn't that harmless experience mean more to a child than simply being told, ""no""? Hell, even with your underestimation of the average child, these are lessons even animals can learn by themselves.

&gt; Don't feed the dog chocolate, even though the dog wants chocolate.

This one is interesting because it involves the potential of causing harm to a third party. Now, I suggest you read the following carefully because you seem to struggle to explain your reasoning since you only resort to blanket restrictions.

It's important to make a connection that the subject of your explanation can understand. If you're explaining this to a child, you would say that the dog can't have it because dogs get stomach cramps when they eat chocolate, *just like you get stomach cramps when...*

It's also an opportunity to teach the kid how to take care of something that can't take care of itself. 

I'm gonna stop writing now because I'm out of time. But if you think that there is no use in explaining the reasoning behind a rule to a child, you're seriously depriving them of a chance to be critical thinkers in the future. If you also don't led kids make mistakes like falling from trees or touching something hot, then they'll never **really** understand why they shouldn't do something. I know parents like that, and I feel sorry for children that have been denied a natural process of growing up.

Please think about what you're doing before subjecting your own children to the regime you're describing above.","1375316349"
"dogs","t5_2qhhk","Simple: dog eats grass, dog gets mouth of grass awns, dog spots person walking behind fence, dog takes a deep breath to charge and bark at the passing intruder, dog aspirates on grass awn and grass awn becomes lodged in lung lobe, few weeks later after a long run with heavy breathing the now developed abscess in lung burst, and you know the rest. 

What could be done to prevent it? I will be significantly more vigilant in keeping it out of my yard. I know these were in our yard this spring and thought nothing of it other than, ""O look, we have wheat growing in our yard, herp ah derp.""

While it is possible for her to have gotten it while running through a field we frequent, I think that the only way for her to have aspirated on it was in the above scenario I just mentioned, otherwise it would have just been swallowed into her stomach and likely digested/passed. Though I am not sure that the grass awn wouldn't also make its way through her stomach lining and into her lung some how. ","1375316349"

&gt; Roger, Anita and their canine clan are packing for the big move to Dalmatian Plantation, a home in the country with plenty of room for the 101 pups and far from the clutches of Cruella DeVil. The feistiest pup, Patch, feels lost in a sea of spots and longs to be a one-of-a-kind wonderdog like his TV hero, Thunderbolt. While watching the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show while it's filming in London. However, the family move will interfere with Patch's opportunity - until he's accidentally left behind in the commotion. Patch heads for the audition to meet his hero. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt's ""trusty"" sidekick, Lightning, reveals that the producers of the show want to replace Thunderbolt with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A veritable reference book to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for the TV star in his attempts at real-life heroics. As for Cruella DeVil - she's back and more obsessed with Dalmatians than ever. At first, she's able to calm her frenzy through an affiliation with a spot-fixated artist.

Now see my friend was smart, he did it once, as a crazy joke. I liked the idea so much that I took one of those BBQ forks and tried it on my left arm. 

The motion is that you're about to stab yourself, but you bend your wrist before it touches skin. It's much safer than Bishop's hand roulette game in the Alien series.

Anyway, I go at it, feeling all confident like a boss until I eventually stab myself.

Didn't go to deep, but it went in, left a tiny rectangular hole, no more than 2x3 mm. I was in shock at first, then I got a bandage with some rubbing alcohol and then I went into the stage of fear. See, as a kid, you think of the most fucked up scenarios possible.

I thought now that I had to get my arm cut off because it would get infected. So I cried like a baby on the way to the nurse's office. I tried to make up a story along the way to tell my aunt because she would probably think low of me and give me shit for doing that. And I would slap myself several times in the faces if I had a time machine and went back to the day. 

So, I make up this story of how I fell on a nail. I go to the nurse, she gets me patched up, says it'll be ok and off I go. 

So, I tell my aunt the fake story and she bought it. The wound heals over a few days and it leaves a tiny scar, almost looks like a birth mark. I still have it. 

And now that I think of it, the wound didn't even hurt that much. It was a little achy at first, but it was fine.

Don't get me wrong, I still firmly believe that if you have no ties to nicotine whatsoever, you're generally better off leaving it that way.

The addiction isn't as bad with e-juice as it is with tobacco, where the nicotine is bolstered by other naturally-occurring tobacco alkaloids.

Also, they have never advertised...ever. They are strictly advertised by word of mouth and have done exceptionally well. Everyone I ask ""have you ever tried Maui Jim sunglasses?"" says one of two things ""no"" or ""yes! It's all I wear!""","1375316361"

That also opens up all sorts of new problems, for instance, say you have a memory problem and cant pass the test because of it? Learning difficulties of another nature perhaps. Those people cant have legal sex?

Education I can agree with. Teach them properly, teach them everything about it.

Not everyone has access to an experienced family member or friend with a car. I didn't. It was fucking expensive.

IIRC the theory test cost £30 and the practical test £70? thats not very cheap for a low income family at all. I also had to take my practical twice because *apparently* I didn't look at the tractor that was coming extremely slowly from miles away at the open as fuck junction. I saw that fucking tractor a looong time before I turned and by the time I turned it was still fucking aaages away. Test man was just a dick.

Shitty parenting is indeed a problem, and better sexual education could probably mostly solve that. Maybe in addition to some child care experience via school?

And getting drunk, yeah it can be dangerous, especially when combined with driving. But we take those peoples licenses away, and any responsible person will stop them from doing it in the first place. A few of my friends have wanted to go drink driving so I persuaded them otherwise.

Preeeetty sure all of this can be solved just by educating our children better. And educating our irresponsible adults too. We dont need more licensing on these things. We have few enough freedoms as it is.","1375316365"

I get a video game vibe from a lot of it, and I don't mean that as an insult.

You'll develop an addiction of sorts to the caffeine eventually, but far from anything debilitating in all but a few cases. Personally, I can go through 3ml of 16mg a day for a while, then drop it for months and not feel a thing beyond that slight psychological urge to puff on something.

Really, if you maintain the mindset that it isn't addictive, and don't hugely overdue it, you shouldn't have much trouble. Half the battle is mental.","1375316372"

When it was drafted, military weaponry wasn't very advanced. A slow-loading single shot rifle was basically the most effective thing out there. These were the arms that civilians were given the right to bear- equivalent arms to the best that the military had. The 2nd amendment has been interpreted in such a way as to allow citizens the continued right to handguns and rifles. However, now the military has tanks and drones and nukes. The 2nd amendment gave people the right to bear arms so that they could have equivalent military might to the armed forces. That way, citizens wouldn't be automatically prevented from a righteous overthrow of the government simply because they were outgunned.

But it didn't work. The citizens are massively outgunned by military weaponry. The 2nd amendment hasn't been relevant for something like 100 years.","1375316376"

"politics","t5_2cneq","This only works in a perfect model though.  By raising the minimum wage corporations would likely lay off half of their employees or double the cost of their products (or both) to ""compensate for losses"".  Now you have half of the previous unskilled labor force unemployed with prices of goods increasing because corporations want more of a profit to appease their shareholders.  Now you have a lack of available jobs in the unskilled labor sector.  Aside from that, there is almost always someone who will do a job for less, especially because many university graduates who could not previously find a job, would be more than happy to take an entry level job at 20 dollars an hour because they have the possibility to increase their status in the company.  Another thing you are not factoring in is the cost of education to be qualified for that theoretical 30 dollar an hour job.  First off, you have to take the cost of the education itself, any UC school cost on average 15k a semester, and in four years that is roughly 120k + probably around 10k of external expenses + the money you lost not working 40 hours a week at Mcdonalds for those four years (140k).  So now the person that joins the entry level job making 25-30 an hour has to compensate for over almost 270k to exceed the lost money he could have been making working at mcdonalds for that time.  It would take a total of 17 years at 27 an hour to equal the total of what you could have been making for that time working for 17 an hour and mcdonalds.","1375316378"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","There is hardly a middle class in the Philippines, or rather, there is nothing set up for them. Most things in the US or in Europe are designed around the the middle class (earners of USD1500-4000 a month). Here, most college graduates don't get to earn that kind of money until they've been working for 5-8 years (if they're lucky). And when they do, they realize they still don't have access to many, many things.

 Anybody in the states that earns some kind of ok salary can afford to buy a 42 inch TV, for example. But here, it's considered a luxury item, so it's marketed to the rich. The prices for these things double; after all, if you're buying this, you HAVE money.

 There are many things that need improvement in the Philippines. There is an amazing amount of untapped talent, and lots of wonderful people, beaches... but they're not taken care of.

In the US or Europe, if someone can't afford to go to school, their taxes pay for a public school so nobody is left behind. That doesn't happen everywhere. Here you can see a lot of kids that can't afford shoes, that sleep in the street and try to sell you flowers on the stop lights. Most Filipinos jump at a chance to go elsewhere (better standards of living, better salary, OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH. That sense of opportunity doesn't seem to exist here, for many.

Those people, I think, are _true_ heroes (in the best and rarest sense of the word).

Thats why they indicate that something like that will happen in approx. 100km! 

However that would be no use in electric cars, because they have to charge for **hours**. You are not even trying to understand.

&gt;I'm talking about the Top Gear test drive of a Tesla Model S.

According to [this source you did not provide](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/mar/05/top-gear-tesla-jeremy-clarkson) they drove the tesla 55 miles around their track and then had to charge it.

From the source:

&gt;Tesla complained about a passage of Clarkson's commentary in which he said: ""Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again."" Clarkson and others are then shown pushing the Roadster into the Top Gear hangar and recharging it.

This is your whole fucking problem? Please explain in detail how it is inaccurate?!

Yeah, I get what you're saying. Although, my DPD is more comforting than lonely. I don't want to be able to connect with my emotions at this stage, sometimes I'm amazed that people go about the world so vulnerable to everything around them. And I really think eyesight is a huge aspect of DPD, it really makes it seem like you're watching a TV screen.

Maybe you could get diagnosed and see about therapy options, as it's impacting your life negatively. There's people out there who can help you. People like us don't reach out though, so you probably won't. You'll make it work, somehow.

"Michigan","t5_2qhtl","You're under some mistaken impressions here.  Colleges determine tuition by determining how to extract the most amount of money from the maximum number of people.  Demand for college education is so high, you're almost guaranteed to get people applying as long as you don't completely price yourself out of your student's ability to pay.  This is particularly true anywhere there is a limit on the number of available seats for a program, which is many places.

A = Amount of money a student can afford out of pocket.

B = Amount of money a student can get in Pell grants and scholarships.

C = Amount of money a student can borrow via student loans.

A + B + C = Buying power of student.  It's a spectrum, of course, but all things being equal is probably normally distributed.  A is bad.  A is something most people don't have.  If lots of your students are using A, you're probably asking too much money of your student body.  Compared to A, B and C are free money.  B is literally free money, C is a debt trap.  This is why colleges work to increase B and C as much as possible.  It's literally getting you to find money to give to them.

Based on your demographics of your student body this year (remember, you often know where the monies generally come from since schools help students get grants and loans) you know roughly what number of students that apply can actually afford to complete 4 (preferably 5) years of school, and how much A they had to use.

Now it's just a simple matter of math.  You have X number of seats available at your school.  Based on your statistical analysis of current year students you can determine what the buying power for students currently is.  Determine the tuition rate that will allow the largest number of student to pay you.

A + B + C = 50000 mean with std dev of 5000 over 4 years.

4000 students apply each year that are academically eligible.

1200 seats become available each year.

1200 / 4000 = 0.3 --&gt; 30%

Assuming normal distribution, you can guesstimate that you can set the tuition at about $52,500 and you'll be able to accept the top 30% of students based on their ability to pay.  Thus, highest tuition and you're at capacity.","1375316397"

Good typographers are very hard to find, and even being an amateur at it bespeaks skills vital to graphic design in general, namely shape, repetition, contrast, scaling relationships and spatial relationships... have you ever noticed that kerning a font tighter makes it appear bolder? Typography is one of the highest forms of graphic design. If you need help finding a program to convert your letter shapes into a font I can help with that, but we'd both be learning. I've never used such a program though I know a lot of graphic design programs and never get intimidated by learning a new one.","1375316397"

She was good at her job, was made a store manager, and caused her store to break all kinds of sales records. I don't think she ever got $10 an hour. Was she a fuck up? She has a college degree, but hadn't been in the work force for a very long time.

"zen","t5_2qhmf","&gt;The worst enemy of Zen experience, at least in the beginning, is the intellect, which consists and insists in discriminating subject from object. The discriminating intellect, therefore, must be cut short if Zen consciousness is to unfold itself, and the koan is constructed eminently to serve this end.

*

&gt;Technically speaking, the koan given to the uninitiated is intended 'to destroy the root of life', 'to make the calculating mind die', 'to root out the entire mind that has been at work since eternity', etc. This may sound murderous, but the ultimate intent is to go beyond the limits of intellection, and these limits can be crossed over only be exhausting oneself once for all, by using up all the psychic powers at one's command. Logic then turns into psychology, intellection into conation and intuition. What could not be solved on the plane of empirical consciousness is now transferred to the deeper recesses of the mind. So, says a Zen master, 'Unless at one time perspiration has streamed down your back, you cannot see the boat sailing before the wind.' 'Unless You have been thoroughly drenched in a perspiration you cannot expect to see the revelation of a palace of pearls on a blade of grass.

&gt;The koan refuses to be solved under any easier conditions. But once solved the koan is compared to a piece of brick used to knock at a gate; when the gate is opened the brick is thrown away. The koan is useful as long as the mental doors are closed, but when they are opened it may be forgotten. What one sees after the opening will be something quite unexpected, something that has never before entered into one's imagination. But when the koan is re-examined from this newly aquired point of view, how marvellously suggestive, how fittingly construted, although there is nothing artificial here!


-Essays in Zen Buddhism Vol. II

&gt;Because words are merely a vehicle on which the truth is carried. Not comprehending the meaning of the old master, they endeavour to find it in his words only, but they will find therein nothing to lay their hands on. The truth itself is beyond all description, as is affirmed by the ancient sage, but it is by words that the truth is manifested.

-Yuan-wu

A koan doesn't have a specific answer. Nor is the answer contingent upon the words. Understanding can see understanding. Tung-shan's 'three chin of flax' is not my or your 'three chin of flax'. ","1375316402"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;I am actually quite surprised that this only showed up on the front page now when it happened a while back. This was HUGE news in Pakistan and among Pakistanis around the world. 

It showed up on /r/climbing and /r/alpinism the day it happened.  As I said, Outside is the Cosmo of outdoor sports, so it took them a month to actually write an article on this tragedy and find space between ""Doggy Backpacks - what's in fashion this year?"" and ""How to drive your man wild with non-deet insect repellents."" *Alpinist*, *Climbing*, *Rock &amp; Ice*, and various other more credible climbing/alpine periodicals covered this immediately, in depth, and with much more informed discussion about the state of mountaineering in Pakistan and of the people there, emphasizing the efforts by the Pakistani government and the Alpine Club of Pakistan to ensure that the people who committed this atrocity are brought to justice.

Yeah, the internet is a great way to make yourself accessible, but it's especially practical when you're at the point where people have a reason to come to you. Build a name for yourself locally first, then leverage your success and experience to reach out to the internet in a more targeted way.

As far as Pognas' advice on being annoying.. it might land you a gig or two, but ultimately I don't see this as being an efficient long-term strategy, especially if you want to stand out. There are thousands just like you employing that same strategy (probably to no avail, although I can't say for certain).

The market place of ideas is fine, but if one is going to deny female privilege exists while insisting male privilege does, as plenty of women in this thread are doing, one needs to make a strong case why the advantages women receive are categorically different.

That doesn't really make sense, though. Every job ""deserves"" whatever wage the market can bear--and in the U.S. that is not a living wage for fast food work. There are a lot of reasons for this, economic, historical, and ideological.

However, I want to point out that, back in the day when ""someone with no high school education could work at a factory and support a small family modestly,"" fast food work did not earn a living wage. Fast food jobs have always offered wages at a discount to the median for unskilled labor, because it's been associated with teenage, part-time work for so long (one of the historical reasons for its current wage level mentioned above).

It's not like this in other countries. The question is whether we want America to be a place where people can support a family on a fast food job, and how that would impact the entrepreneurial spirit that has driven American growth in previous eras.

Lobbying is Constitutionally protected beyond the general speech right.  Lobbying is, quite specifically, the right to ""petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""

&gt; There is research to this effect that demonstrates they get a very good return on investment with these activities.

Lobbying is different than donations, though.  Lobbying won't be going anywhere, there's absolutely zero way to fairly limit that access.

&gt; And the American people believe the system is rigged. A government cannot be perceived as legitimate if the system is viewed as rigged.

If the American people are misinformed, we do not change the rules to meet their skewed perception, but rather fix the perception.

&gt; Money is simply the influence PED of politics. So if you want to think that none of that rigs the game and they are just fools wasting their money, you are free to do that. And that would seem to make every rich person buying influence actually a giant idiot. They aren't idiots.

I don't think it rigs it as much as shows support.  You need money to win elections.  There's no evidence of the corrupting influence you allege.

Ill answer your why we shouldn't do wrong or ""immoral"" things. It's within your best interest. 

Yep, that's the basic answer. If you want to acheive a happy, peaceful and friendly society, cause you know, we are not alone here, don't do anything that involuntary causes harm to others in any way. If don't want to be raped, don't do or condone it. If you don't want to be murdered, don't murder others. It's simple, yet people like to complicate it.

You know what you're doing is wrong, whether you want to deny it or not, and its simple as that. If everyone took this outlook, the world wouldn't be so bad. 

But ill give you the benefit of the doubt in agreeing nothing in terms of right, wrong or moral is absolute. However when you live in a society, you need to set some inforced standards to protect people from unnecissary harm so the society is peaceful to live under. Even if you don't agree with such a standard, it's necissary to keep order within the people.

So you can keep your little, nothing is wrong, but agree that we must set what is arbitrarily detremental to a society as a rule. That comes directly from moral relativism, not absolutes.","1375316422"

If those fast food workers don't like making 7.25 an hour, then quit and get a job that pays 15. You know why they don't? They can't. And that's not the fault of McDonald's. Many of them don't have any marketable skills that I can't get in a high school kid. You mean to tell me that I should pay some 16 year old kid who hasn't even completed high school, let alone studied a trade or any other discipline, is worth $15 to do the minimal amount of work you need to do at a McDonald's?","1375316427"

There are games that have massive benefits from having multiple points of view. Battlefield, Grand Theft Auto, Minecraft for example all have large spaces for players to use. So, the one player recording may not always have a view of when a creeper kills a player or when a friend C4s a tank.

My point is, is that you have all the player viewpoints from this one house. Switching the view between 2-3 players that are usually shooting out of windows, in roughly the same direction, on the same floor, at the same guys.

There are moments when people get caught in the basement or run to the van. That's all great for creating a better narrative for the viewer. But other than that it isn't being very effective.","1375316428"

Those are deductive ""processes"" and can either be rational or irrational.

Now, if I make a statement: ""Missy is an animal,"" without any other information, would you define that statement as rational, irrational, or arational? Its just a statement, and its not really rational or irrational, its rather outside the realm of rationality, so it'd be arational, wouldn't it?

I've encountered this belief many times on reddit from Europeans and most of the time you try and explain that patriotism does not run rampant in the US and that their perceptions are off and they just don't listen. I don't know why they think an explanation from someone in the US would be not worth listening to when they have never set foot in the country. My only guess is that some foreigners want reasons to hate the US and don't want to listen, though honestly there's plenty of legitimate things to dislike so I don't know why people cling to this view...

One other thing I'd point out is that this is not entirely isolated to foreigners... As has been mentioned elsewhere, the US is a large and diverse nation and while people will often tell you how we're not overly patriotic, to be honest a lot of people probably share similar views about certain parts of our country. For example, I was really tempted to reply to this ""We're not all flag waving gun toting bible thumping patriots. That's just Texas."" Now I say that mostly in jest but it points out that different parts of this country share wildly different views (though, obviously, we're talking about a vocal majority view as of course even deeply conservative parts of the nation have their share of liberals, etc).","1375316431"

the way SCOTUS works is that if a judge should need to recuse him or herself, they do so, and the others carry on. or, if they are absent due to illness or for other reasons, the others carry on. all 9 judges are not required. it's nothing new.

and somebody like clarence thomas should know that even a hint of impropriety taints the entire judgement. given that both justices thomas and scalia are, or were (i'm not sure about their current associations) frequent guests and contributors to GOP strategy sessions funded by AFP (kochs) then really, both should probably recuse themselves in any matters of any consequence, permanently.

the entire purpose of lifetime appointments is to *do away with* the infusement of partisan politics and short-term thinking in the supreme court. instead, it's become a license to align however they see fit, and to work for whomever they see fit, rather than uphold the law and the constitution for the people, and the nation as a thing and an idea/ideal.","1375316432"

I think you don't understand that time won't stand still for you.  You think that picking the wrong job will limit you; but in fact picking *no* job will limit you more.  Once you turn 30 or older, people won't even consider you for entry-level positions any more if you don't have some kind of job experience.  They'll see you for what you are, that is, someone who can't commit to anything (and likely won't commit to them).  There were many times, when I was in my twenties, when I assumed that doors were closing all around me and that I would be trapped in my job (and my entry-level responsibilities) forever.  Now, I'm finding that having a solid resume that shows I can learn and grow is opening doors for me that would never be open before.  I've also learned skills (dealing with superiors and coworkers, being organized, etc.) that will be applicable anywhere.  If you stay on your current course, you'll have none of that.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The only time it makes sense to stand in any President's way and ""check"" their power as leader of this country is when his efforts will harm the country.  Checking it for any other reason was NOT the purpose for our ""checks and balances"" system of government.  Do you have any specific reason to oppose any of the policy directives which the President has proposed with his executive actions?  If so, what are those policies and what are your reasons for opposing them?  

I agree that it shouldn't come to this, but Congressional Conservatives have left no other option since they completely refuse to negotiate in good faith or enable functional government.  Packing Congress with seditious legislators is a disgrace that would NEVER have happened absent the Citizens United decision which undermined this nation's Democracy.

Anyone who claims that this Congress represents the true will of the American people is only kidding themselves.  The institution is packed with Koch whores and corporate shills intent on sabotaging government through every means possible.  Until that trash is flushed from government, I don't blame the President for marginalizing them through whatever means necessary.  As for the notion that this will encourage Conservatives to ignore/circumvent Congressional Democratic opposition in the future...when HAVEN'T they?  If anything, President Obama is simply giving them a taste of their own medicine.

For the record, I recall Ronald Reagan and several of his Republican successors circumventing Congressional Democrats on MANY occasions to radically alter government, it's policies and its capabilities.  Heck, Reagan even came close to getting impeached over ignoring Congress' admonitions to stay out of the war in Nicaragua and in willfully violating an arms embargo with Iran.  That's what the Iran-Contra scandal was all about...breaking prevailing laws and violating Congress' and the American people's wishes.

Now, what possible reason could a Police Officer have to make a rapid U-Turn and then speed off as fast as possible?  Maybe he got a call from dispatch.  Maybe he either got nervous, too excited, or simply screwed up and gunned it too hard on the U-Turn.  Maybe he bumped the kid on accident, got out and apologized to the kid, the kid decided not to press charges since it looks like an accident, and then the Officer proceeds to wherever dispatch called him to at all possible speed.

Maybe that happened, maybe it didn't.  We don't know because the video was edited in such a way as to leave the cop no chance to defend himself and no explanation provided for what happened.  There is no apparent reason for the Cop to hit the kid, there is no indication that it was intentional, the kid doesn't seem to have a problem with it, nor does anyone around him except the guy holding the camera.","1375316446"

Yesterday they were there dozens of them in 3 feet of water. Unfortunately the visibility was terrible, so you wouldn't see anything and then all of a sudden you would have a large group of them all around you. I know they're completely harmless, but it did get to be a bit nerve racking. I have yet to have a day with good diving conditions, good lighting, and a ton of sharks. 

(619) 221-8824 &lt;--- This is the number for the San Diego City beach and weather report. It includes the diving conditions for both La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Cove. I personally don't think it's worth it unless the visibility is at least 10-15 ft, but that's because my GoPro doesn't do well in murky conditions (or I'm too n00b to know how to get the most out of it).

"VoiceActing","t5_2r878","I'm not sure how much you know about audio engineering and gear so I'll just start with the basics.

You'll need an audio interface. An interface is what takes your analog signal and turns it into a digital signal for the computer. Most of these interfaces come with built in preamplifiers so that you could plug in a mic (or instrument) right out of the box. Also, they are usually USB or Firewire. There are a few decent ones for around $100. I've heard good things about this [Lexicon](http://www.guitarcenter.com/Lexicon-Alpha-USB-Desktop-Recording-Studio-103840849-i1126259.gc) unit.

A mic. I would go with a good cheap condenser microphone like this [MXL](http://www.guitarcenter.com/MXL-990-Condenser-Microphone-with-Shockmount-106203706-i1126975.gc).Condensers usually produce brighter, clearer sounds and are more for recording than live sound.

If you have it in your budget, you should get your hands on some good over-ear headphones. Sure, Sennheiser, Sony, or AKG make great low budget headphones. If you cant get headphones then your computer speakers will work fine.

I agree with psguitarist7 about Audacity. Its free to download and very simple to use. 

Hope this helps, and good luck!","1375316457"

&gt;Some rewording strategies that can be employed:

   &gt; Use a plural noun: Students should save their questions until the end.
    Use the formal one: One should save one's questions until the end.
    Use his or her: Each student should save his or her questions until the end

**Comparison of most Yi starting items:** I've calculated master yi's dps at level 12 over 5 seconds with different starts, Assuming 80 armor. 70 mr target who has 1.8k max hp and 1k average health over those 5 seconds (relevant for BoTRK calculation). To compensate for the gold differences between each starting core item I assumed yi spends the extra gold on boots 2 and doran's (i.e. for triforce I calculated the dps of yi with only triforce+boots1 but for youmuu's I assumed yi has youmuu's, dblade and boots2 because it costs so much less). These dps calculations are rough estimates as I actually forgot to factor in armor for his Q damage and I've estimated the enemy targets stats as well as other factors, but seeing as I made that same mistake on each dps calculation my math should give us a relevant comparison.

**dps comparison**: 1. BOTRK at 390 dps 2. BT at 341 3 dps. Youmuu's at 333 dps (this falls off after 6 seconds though) 4. Triforce at 327 dps 5. Shiv at 320 dps

**Other factors**: Starting youmuu's is out of the questions because it's dps is only comparable while the actives is up (although it does grant 70 more MS than the other starts while active, I don't think that matters though as 510 or 580 MS are both enough to chase down anyone). Starting shiv is also out of the question as it's dps is somewhat lower without granting any other interesting passives/actives as the other options do (I took the shiv passive into account when calculating dps). BT is outclassed by BoTRK, so it's out. That leaves us with BoTRK and Triforce.

**conclusion**: BoTRK and Triforce are the two starts I'd suggest considering when playing ad yi. To decide between them I'd consider such factors as: Do I want crit chance? Do I need health or lifesteal? Are they stacking HP? Do I need bonus mana for Q? Am I focusing on Q+resets (in which case go triforce)? How valuable will the BoTRK speed/slow active be?","1375316458"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There are two main types of Satanism, generally. You have the LaVey Satanism and the Classical Satanism.

LeVay Satanism was founded by [Anton LaVey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_LaVey) and is more of a philosophy than what most people think of as a religion. For example, LaVey satanists do not believe in a literal god and devil. They think of them as an analogy or metaphor for forces in a persons life. LaVey Satanists hold themselves to be the highest being, and the only one who matters. Thus, they feel that they can and should act on any desire they have. If they fail, they should make themselves stronger so that their desire can be achieved. And if their success comes at the expense of someone else, then they have done that person a favor by exposing their weaknesses to them.

Classical Satanism is less common, but is based on the idea that instead of worshiping Jehova (the God commonly worshiped in Jewish and Christian religions) they worship Lucifer. Their main idea being that Lucifer was attempting to free humanity from enslavement to Jehova, by bringing knowledge and free will, and freeing humanity from following gods laws and rules.

* Just because PVP is allowed, it is not advised that you engage in it without careful consideration of who, where and why you're killing. People who wantonly kill people often end up with bounties, and subsequently are imprisoned in the End (more on that below).

* The End acts as a phantom zone for Civcraft, many of the people who have been sent there (via being killed by someone who was holding an Ender Pearl in their inventory) are griefers, criminals or people of ill-repute. In many servers the only price to getting killed is simply loss of items, that is not the case in Civcraft- you can be imprisoned if killed.

* We have many plugins, you should look them over and ask people in-game about any questions you have about them. One of the great things about Civcraft is that you can almost play vanilla if you want, but plugins can give you major advantages in protecting, producing, and prospering. ","1375316461"

In societies that do not accept homosexuality, gay people are not just scared of oppression. When everyone around you is telling you you are a freak and a pervert, it's surprisingly difficult not to believe them, which is what people mean by ""repression"" - not hiding your sexuality from other people, but hiding it from *yourself*. (If you don't believe people can convince themselves of things they know to be false: ""I am definitely only going to read one more thread on reddit, and I'm going to be in bed by midnight, and definitely not hit snooze, and be really productive tomorrow"". Same principle. You are repressing a fact that you already know very well from great previous experience - that you are lazy - and most people do this in small, harmless ways.)

I love his cartoonish stuff in *Mars Attacks!* &amp; *Batman*, he's a damned funny guy.  *The Passenger* is one I haven't seen yet, it's now been added to my ""to watch"" list.","1375316468"

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","The football culture really is amazing round here, its just a completely different experience to watching it at home. Im only 18 so i've not had the chance to be at Old Trafford that much, but this is my 4th year of having a season ticket. That madrid game this year was an amazing experience, although we didn't win, everything about that day was incredible. The build up and the buzz around town was great, pubs were full of reds by about 3 in the afternoon, and then the atmosphere in the stadium was the best i've ever heard. You should definitely try and get yourself to Manchester for a big game like that. I guess i'm pretty lucky that Old Trafford is just a half hour train ride away from my house.","1375316469"
"toronto","t5_2qi63","I went to High school with him and we even had a class together in our senior year (2012), from what I remember he never spoke up and frequently skipped all together. While my interaction with him was very limited, I know for a fact he didn't have any aggressive behavioral issues at school and when he was in class, he would sit and listen like the rest of us. Granted a year has gone by and who can say what sort of activities/people he surrounded himself with and the role they played in his final year. 

To me it's pretty shocking hearing this sort of thing about a guy I thought nothing much of before we graduated, especially after seeing the videos myself. I sense my own bias around the issue but I cannot see justification in the degree of force used by the police to subdue a strolling knife wielding criminal. I'm not sure where you see him charging, he paces back and forth on the street car at most.","1375316469"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Christians, I know it is the central dogma of your faith to proclaim that Jesus was crucified for our sins and resurrected into heaven.

Dogma has a particular meaning that may not be appropriate here. The historicity of Jesus being crucified by Pontius Pilate for sedition is actually one of the three bits of the story most scholars concur on. And he wasn't 'resurrected into heaven...' 

It is very likely he was seen alive after the crucifixion...or people thought they saw him. It would have been very difficult for Christianity to sustain the interest in it by people of the time if there weren't some serious legitimate belief about him being alive after crucifixion.


&gt;We are consistently told that god can't predict the future of man because of free will.

We can't predict the movement of individual atoms in a slice of bread but we can predict the energy it will take for it to turn dark-brown. Just like in The Matrix maybe God tried several times with several people. Maybe He's not done trying

&gt;he preached for several decades and then died of pancreatic cancer? Would we be still be saved?

It's possible, one scholar thinks Paul and Jesus were actually alive at the same point in time. We really have very little historical knowledge of that time. Personally I think it's possible he was taken alive from the cross while Roman soldiers looked the other way.

 
If you see Jesus as just a man with extraordinary wisdom with an extraordinary life story then still his insights into human nature, just like the OT are worth reading, regardless of any religious idea of salvation and redemption.","1375316469"
