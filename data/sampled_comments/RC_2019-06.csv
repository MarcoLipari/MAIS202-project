Dr. Strange and the sorcerers use the time stone since it‚Äôs in their possession, they protect it but it‚Äôs also their greatest weapon. However, because of the time stone, that‚Äôs how they were thrown into the plot of the Infinity Sage. Thanos would come for them because they had something he needs.

\*sigh* Source.

&gt; They're not the same at all, you're wrong. Gyoro Gyoro created monsters and was flabbergasted that Garou holds onto his humanity. Garou is fueled by his own drive and gets a rush from wanting to do things that are the exact opposite of being a monster, like protecting little kids and fighting for ideals. Garou never abandons his humanity and is the only other character aside from Saitama who is actually, legitimately mentioned to be in the process of breaking the limiter by the narrator himself. Orochi doesn't even go there.

Gyoro Gyoro's process, as stated by her, is her method to break through the ""limit of growth"" (which is exactly what the limiter is). She did it to Orochi, and she did it to Garou (in the manga). Garou gets stronger and stronger [wc](/s ""and narration says his limiter is about to come off"").

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","The kingdom of God includes heaven and earth.  The Kingdom, on earth as it is in heaven, which God had spoken by mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began concerned solely the land which had been promised to Abraham and his seed.
Acts 3:20-21 KJV
[20] And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: [21] Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
 
The Gospel of the Kingdom, not the gospel of the kingdom of God, is the gospel Christ taught during His earthly ministry.  ‚ÄúThe kingdom is at hand.‚Äù  John the Baptist, Christ‚Äôs cousin, proclaimed it to Israel.  Christ taught it and chose the disciples to proclaim it.  The leaders of Israel rejected it.  In Acts 7 at the stoning of Stephen their offer was refused.  Now what?  How was the rest of the world going to be partakers of a kingdom if it didn‚Äôt happen?  A new/hidden gospel was introduced to the chief persecutor of the little flock which did accept the kingdom gospel.  Remember Saul of Tarsus?  On his way to Damascus with legal documents to continue his persecutions he had a significant emotional experience.  Paul the Apostle to the Gentiles had revealed to him by Christ from heaven a gospel which was new and hidden up to that point.  Romans 16:25 KJV
[25] Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,
 
Notice the revelation of the mystery and how Paul calls it ‚Äúmy gospel?‚Äù  It‚Äôs also called the Gospel of Christ.  It‚Äôs not the same.  Did Christ tell the disciples to follow Paul‚Äôs gospel?  No.  It hadn‚Äôt been revealed to Paul until after Israel as a nation rejected their kingdom gospel.  The Gospel of the Grace of God was first revealed to and instituted by Paul.  Those that preach and teach the gospel of the kingdom today are doing a disservice to all.  They should heed the warnings scripture has.  Galatians 1:6-9 KJV
[6] I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: [7] Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. [8] But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. [9] As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

Today heaven is offered; not an earthly kingdom, to all individually without having to go through the nation Israel; by grace through faith in Paul‚Äôs Gospel.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","I think it's only a matter of time until the younger generation takes over, and all these crazy old people die out. The problem we have today is not from the kids, teenagers or young adults, the problem we have is old people in power, holding back the generation below them from advancing and thus evolving into a better world.

"Tekken","t5_2s7yn","If you are in a char crisis, I feel people being half ass to fix it isn't the way to go. Don't make it to be a 2-3 char pool to pick from. Keeping going through the cast, give it 2-3 days each to get a handle of their play style or something cool about them you can replicate and see if you want to stick with them. Also don't get intimidated with chars like Kaz needing stuff like WD/EWGF and character knowledge. Besides the character knowledge won't really become pivotal until you commit more to the game in which cases, you get it as well with experience. Execution can be improved with proper practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take it from me. I started with Josie, went to Shaheen and as effective he was his style of play is kinda boring.  Touched a bit of Bob (could do it again if I can wrap my head on his mid range wavedash approach), Went to Anna (still trying with her) and ultimately ended up with AK. And I still want to try Marduk because he's got a similar well rounded play style but its crazy explosive with damage and Devil Jin because besides electrics, he has a well rounded kit. And I don't even need to be on point with electrics at low levels than relying on the rest of his kit for punishes.",1559347204

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Exilus Fray, human divination wizard. During his time as an academy student, he undertook a ritual with a group of friends, including his fianc√©. The spell, an altered version of Bigby‚Äôs hand went horribly awry, leaving Exilus the sole survivor as the the other‚Äôs souls were dragged absorbed by a giant ethereal hand. 

After failing to have them resurrected, Exilus became obsessed with the concept of time travel, wishing to rewind to the moment of the accident and prevent it.

This is where things (hopefully) diverge. Exilus fails over and over again. The years stretch on, placing his goals further out of reach. His attempts become progressively more desperate as his sanity slips. Convinced that he‚Äôs living on a ‚ÄúFalse timeline‚Äù, he justifies heinous acts and spells in his pursuit. His friends and allies desert him. Finally, reaching the end of his natural lifespan, he becomes a lich to continue his research. Now he dwells in the magically fortified ruins of the academy where the accident took place, making occasional forays into the outside world to pursue leads on time travel. Those who encounter the lich claim to hear him absently muttering four names over and over again. The names of the friends he lost centuries ago. 

You can easily have him come as a mid-late level stand-alone villain, or a secondary foe being manipulated by a larger threat. You can make things dire by having him on the edge of resetting the timeline with something like a sphinx or The Deck of Many Things.",1559347204

**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --&gt; (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","&gt;Yeah, it does. It explains your irrationality.

No it dosn't I'm quite rational.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Nobody was 'created'. We are merely part of an interdependent web of  life that forms complex yet fragile ecosystems. We choose to either  participate in the protection of these natural systems, or to destroy  them at our own peril. 

So then why do men lack the reproductive organs capable of carrying a child to term and giving birth? And the very nature of birth is the combination of a fertile egg with sperm carrying preprogramed blue prints for lack of better term. That slowly takes nutrients from the mother's body as it divides it's cells over and over again following the programed blueprint to literally construct a human body from materials drawn from the human body.  If you know anything about the reproductive cycle then you know created is a very apt term for the process of human development in the womb. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Appeal to nature fallacy. Irrelevant. The fact is you have no  requirement (or right) to subject sentient beings to enslavement and  death. 

Wrong logical fallacy appeal to nature only works if I claim that anything that is natural is better. For example assuming holistic medicine is better simply because it is natural.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal\_to\_nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature) I do not claim that eating meat is superior only that it is natural for us to eat meat.

&amp;#x200B;

The flip side of your argument is that you equally have no requirement or right to judge someone else for their actions. Yet you do because you see that argument is a two way street not just a one way were you get to stand on your soap box and declare others heathens and heretics for their actions to be burned at the stake.  This isn't Warhammer 40k and you are not the Inquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; So if hitler won he would've been just and moral ? Gold star for mental gymnastics buds. 

Were do I mention morality? I rather specifically dismiss morality from the situation looking at just basic facts.  Hitler is nothing more then one of a long line that continues to this day of people who have grabbed power and wiped out people who did nothing wrong but helps support their rule.  And frankly if your not even going to read what I post then there isn't much point to continue a conversation with you because you are only talking to yourself and not me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I'm not 'morally...

So you are morally against it because there is no logic or independent ideas it is only morality is the only reason to do or not to do something. So by being against it you are morally against it.  It is always amusing how annoyed vegans tend to get when you use their own morality argument against them. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The concept ......

&amp;#x200B;

So your telling me deer don't eat plants and the wolves eat the deer?   Of Penguins and leopard seals swimming together and living together in harmony?  Do killer whales only target seals that are ass holes? 

&amp;#x200B;

Morality is a human invention and it is a fluid creation that always changes from day to day, hour to hour and location to location. What was considered morally good 50 years ago is different then today and will be different in 50 years. What is considered morally good in the USA is different then what it would be considered in Japan. Morality isn't fact it can't be proven or dis-proven it is the equivalent of saying ""God wants \_\_\_\_\_"" Cultists who kill other people in the name of their cult are morally justified in their actions in their own head.  Religious fundamentalist who kill other people of the same religion who practice just slightly different religious services is morally justified to them. 

  
I think they are all morally wrong but how does my morality over ride theirs? What aspect of my morality makes it better then theirs? Just because I believe in mine  and and I don't support theirs?  How do you awnser that statement that shows your morality is better then that of a cultist?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I never said they justified it - re-read...(maybe slowly if that helps?) 

Ok

&gt;   Animals frequently rape each other but we don't try and justify rape  with the same logic?  

Your statement is directly saying that rape is acceptable and justified in nature.  Thus why we don't use it to justify when a human rapes another human.  If you meant anything else then you had poor word choice when writing that sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; There's no humane way to forcibly take a life. Go watch some  slaughterhouse footage kid, this is a very naive thing to say. Painless  deaths aren't profitable. 

Oh there absolutely is humane ways to take a life. Those slaughter house footage are often leaked examples of people not enforcing the rules they are suppose to follow. Much in the same way videos of police shooting unarmed individuals as they flee is examples of police not enforcing the rules they are suppose to follow. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever experienced  electronarcosis  before? Because the person who discovered it or at least made it public knowledge describes the experiences as like being in a dream unable to feel anything or move but still conscious. It was also often used in electroshock therapy to prevent patients from thrashing around during the treatment.  Science supports the statement and you only have opinions to claim other wise.  


&gt; "" Traditionally the definition for omnivory was entirely behavioral by  means of simply ""including both animal and vegetable tissue in the diet""  [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/omnivore](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/omnivore) 

Yes and the nature of science is that we developer greater understandings and thus change our views. 

* Behavioral:  This definition is used to specify if a species or  individual is actively consuming both plant and animal materials.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-:1-20)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-21)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-23) (e.g. ""vegans do not participate in the omnivore based diet."")
* Physiological:  This definition is often used in academia to specify  species that have the capability to obtain energy and nutrients from  both plant and animal matter.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-Reese-24)\[[*page¬†needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)\][\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-:2-6)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-:0-19)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-25) (e.g. ""humans are omnivores due to their capability to obtain energy and nutrients from both plant and animal materials."")

&gt; Cats need taurine - dogs can survive without any supplementation. Also - completely irrelevant. 

If you are feeding them decent quality dog food or you are providing them fresh meat in the form of raw diet that includes not just the obvious red meat but also intestines and other organs that contain other trace elements not found in pure red meat.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The rest is an appeal to nature fallacy which is so incredibly boring  and receptively repeated by every idiot who tries to justify the  violence they pay for that I'm not going to bother to address it. 

No it is based on the dietary requirements of a cat and dogs.  Go to any pet story and find a vegetarian dog food and check the protein, carb, etc list and it will be near identical to the meat based diets and a lot more vitamin supplements added into the diet. I worked in a pet store for 5 years after I got out of high school and while it wasn't common there was always at least one person a week who wanted a vegetarian diet for their dog and some times even cat.  which at that point I wonder why they didn't just get a rabbit since they are naturally herbivores.",1559347206

But on the Anaconda situation (as all installation wizards: YaST, Debian Installer, etc), at least in my opinion, should be doing that automatically then. Since people wouldn't be aware of the swap situation the automatic partitioning should do the correct one, anything else would be through the advanced/custom partitioning.

I guess to implement that...calculation would be trivial and would be the recommendation that'd cover the not the majority, but all users. And observing what openSUSE people did with the BTRFS root partition and subvolumes implementation (Richard Brown's BTRFS playground :) ), it mustn't be trouble, just forgotten to be implemented.

If you truly believe a 16 year old having sex with ""an extremely attractive woman of 22"" is a sexual assault against the 16 year old, despite OP not even hinting a thing in that direction, then why are you talking about it in such a pedestrian way?

If you believe in your accusation, then why are you not calling for that woman to go to jail? And if you are not prepared to do that, why bother calling it a sexual assault in the first place?

Also I have to wonder, how is a woman who went through all the difficulties of pregnancy by herself, and is presumably a single mother, who also by looks of it should know the family would not press charges, who did not ask for child support, not be entirely in the right to unilaterally decide who does or does not have a relationship with her daughter?

Honestly, I don‚Äôt have an explanation to share based on the described circumstances, but blackholing also seems like a different problem from rejections - but I don‚Äôt want to make things up, so no answer here.

I could speculate that it‚Äôs possible that past abuse originating from same AWS IPs may have prompted receiving servers to enforce authentication (speculation), but that would be very unusual.

It may explain partial/intermittent success (which may depend on which instance sent the message), but TBH I don‚Äôt know AWS that well - so my assumptions about them rotating IPs is completely speculative as well, and enforcing presence of SPF authentication based on IPs is also very unusual - none of the major bigname ESP servers that I managed did that (in terms of rejections for not having domain records for SPF authentication).

Blackholing is a heavy handed solution aimed at large scale spam abuse, and I‚Äôm assuming you are not a spammer. If you are, that could explain the situation a bit better :) but I don‚Äôt judge while off duty ;)

We were really put to the test when we lost her Mother.  It was over about a 4 month period, and there were many weekend trips to the hospital 3 hours away.  I stayed home with the kids and changed my schedule around to make it work.  After it was over there was a long grieving period for her, this took the most toll on us.  We have always been really close and at that time we were so far separated I wasn't sure we would be able to get it back.  It took a lot of talking and sharing and a new commitment between the two of us.

Coming up on your second point, a majority of mass shootings do happen in gun free zones, which is where they get their point from. 

Gun owners (that aren't fudds) feel that any kind of reform, will lead to more reforms that will eventually lead to bans, or even more infringement on their second amendment. Which they also believe that the second defends the rest of the amendments, which is why some people are so amendment about it not being touched.

I've had my Sony A6500 since Jan. 2017. Recently, I've been noticing that my pictures have a radial glare through the center of them. In order to try and fix this, I updated my firmware to the latest version and had the sensor professionally cleaned. Neither of these resolved the issue. The glare happens regardless of which lens I use. The glare is more dominant on solid colors such as the sky. (See Photo Below)

Sony quoted me $389 to have the camera looked at. The camera has never been dropped or had any accidents. Has anyone else experienced this? Any recommendations? I really don't want to have to pay $400 to have the camera repaired. But, I don't know what else to do. Any help or advice is welcomed.

1. Kirito. Of course, who else could be number one? He is *the* black swordsman. Master of the holding-two-swords technique give it up for the legendary hero of Aincrad that all other anime swordsmen look up to, *KIRITOOOOO!!!!*

2. Swords Guy from the anime Sword Gai. One of the most epic anime swordsmen to ever be in an anime. He revolutionised swordsmen in anime by not actually being a real sword user at all. Iirc he, like, lost his arm in an accident and the retarded doctor didn't know what to do so he taped a sword to his body and said it was his new arm.. or something? I dunno, that show is a big blur to me. But regardless, Swords Guy is a truly cool sword user in anime. 

3. Edward Elric-Kun from the hit anime Hagane no Renkinjutsushi. This dude is cool because like, alright he also lost his arm right? But instead of just having a sword arm now he has like some kind of metal arm that when he casts his hocus pocus magic spells upon he can actually transform into a deadly blade that he can use to compete with other anime swords users.

"zizek","t5_2s3h6","Marxism-Leninism is still relevant to the modern world, I don‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt believe it is. 

My impression is that you consider all of these sects of socialists as irrelevant therefore we should drop labels and just focus on good old fashion socialism. But of course the question is how do you differ from all these other factions? Do you consider yourself above all this petty infighting? Is everyone dumb except for you?

Yes it‚Äôs easy to say the only thing that matters is organizing. But as Zizek would say (from quoting someone else) ‚Äúokay that works in practice but does it work in theory?‚Äù 

Basically what you seem to be saying is that we should abandon theory (the root of all these sects ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù to the modern age) which is of course ridiculous. Sounds like some Eduard Bernsteinite bullshit.

I understand yes, we shouldn‚Äôt be letting our views of obscure historical events get in the way of a new political project. BUT, how we view those certain historical events is important, if you look at the disagreements it‚Äôs about important fundamental questions (ie. what does it mean to be socialist, to what extent is nationalism good, etc).",1559347214
"aws","t5_2qh84","They use [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=process) which takes a function and a list of parameters and executes that function in multiple processes in parallel. Those parameters are passed to the new processes using [pickling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). That limits the types of data you can pass. Based on this code, it seems like you can't pickle boto3 sessions and that's why they create a new session in each process in the `getMetrics()` function.

To use profiles all you have to do is pass the profile to the session constructor.

    boto3.Session(profile_name=""myprofile"", region_name=instance[""Placement""][""AvailabilityZone""][:-1])

If you want to use multiple profiles, maybe you can pass the profile name to `getMetrics()` as a parameter.

It seems like `p_mode` is part of an incomplete feature that allows querying multiple accounts. The code checks if it's `""single""` and if not it prints an error.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""session name"", but if you mean using a different profile, then yes, those are the two lines you want to change. Note that `getInstances()` is called in the main process and `getMetrics()` is called in the worker processes.",1559347214

Me encanta por fin un debate sin acritud, con exposiciones francas, diversas pero alejadas del consabido ""este tiene que irse"" o ""aquel ha fracasado y es el √∫nico responsable"", en fin gracias. Ahora voy a tratar de aportar mi granito de arena.

Nuestros documentos tasan que y c√≥mo se consulta, que quien y como convoca la asamblea y me parece que este es un momento crucial para no experimentar soluciones improvisadas o fuera de lugar. Hay tiempo y ya nos hemos maltratado bastante delante de nuestros enemigos como para darles m√°s chances en medio de la negociaci√≥n de un gobierno que solo queremos nosotros o una parte de nosotros.

Tenemos que hacer un cuidadoso an√°lisis de los resultados de esta marat√≥n electoral donde part√≠amos como perdedores en todas las encuestas encaminadas a fortalecer la premisa de que era indispensable el voto √∫til para defendernos de un problema que en Andalucia lleg√≥ al 10% y sin embargo los medios lo presentaron como si fueran mayor√≠a absoluta. Yo no soy capaz de profundizar mucho. Pero mi peque√±a aportaci√≥n es que: 

Las confluencias decidieron, salvo los comunes dejarnos, la primera compromis, que se atribuyeron en exclusiva la obtenci√≥n del grupo parlamentario en la anteriores y arrastraron en estas a las mareas, pues parece que los √∫nicos que leyeron bien los resultados de 2015/16 fueron los comunes pues ninguna obtuvo grupo propio.


Los resultados de Errej√≥n nos ha sido vendido como la verificaci√≥n de que su tesis es la correcta y que ese es el camino simplificando unos resultados que en mi opini√≥n tienen una segunda lectura, dejar√© a un lado la utilizaci√≥n en campa√±a de medios pagados por podemos para usarlos luego contra podemos e ir√© a las cifras concretas: 

El resultado de m√°s Madrid en la comunidad m√°s los resultados de podemos no s√≥lo est√°n por debajo de los resultados de podemos en las generales de este a√±o sino que tambi√©n est√°n por debajo de la suma de podemos e IU en 2015, me gustar√≠a saber si esto era el aporte que traer√≠a √ç√±igo, de aquellos que √©l dec√≠a que faltan y que s√≥lo √©l era capaz de atraer. Parece que al final no les era atractivo cambiar solo las personas, para eso no merece la pena el riesgo a que otra vez te dejen por imb√©cil al votar una cosa y que te den otra por que la realidad se impone.

En fin siento el tocho, gracias por vuestra comprensi√≥n

Salud os",1559347215

So that means if you use less gas, that only lowers the price of gas and the same gas gets used by someone else.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Free Trade is a fool‚Äôs pursuit as long as U.S. trade adversaries engage in the same mercantilist practices that China is guilty of practicing.

That conclusion doesn't follow from your premise. Don't you know who actually pays tarrifs? Every American who wants a good from a foreign company does. The cost to the foreign country is secondary considering that, to them, we're only part of their foreign market, but to us, we're *all* of our part of their foreign market. Tariffs only prop up businesses that our workforce has matured out of. They benefit those *few* businesses at the expense of the *many* people not in those businesses, and at the expense of all the new businesses we don't go into because our workforce is sitting in these government protected ruts.

It would be nice if other countries let our companies sell products in their land without tariffs, but the cost of domestic tariffs in retaliation is greater than the cost of foreign tariffs against us. Trump has not, that I've seen, used hiking tariffs as a bargaining lever to lower tariffs unilaterally. In fact he's consistently referred to free-er trade agreements like NAFTA as bad deals. It's one of the few things he's actually been consistent on verbally.

Making the right economic trade-offs for an economy as large and varied as ours, is not the simple result of mirroring the policies of countries that are both developmentally behind us, and completely different from us culturally and politically.",1559347217

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Cool, let's go through these.  I got through about half, before questioning whether you'd read them as thoroughly as I did, or were just shotgunning links. 

I should note that I never claimed BMI is *the most* accurate method of estimating body fat; only that it is surprisingly good at it. It is particularly well suited for diagnosing obesity.

**Article 1:** The most it does is state that ""some people are healthy with other BMIs."" This is true; 5% of men and 1% of women would indeed constitute ""some"". It argues that, because BMI is old, and simple to calculate, that this somehow makes it less accurate, when the article I sent debunks this. Neither age nor simplicity make a diagnostic tool inherently less accurate. The article lends quite a lot of focus to potential outliers of BMI, without once mentioning the prevalence of said outliers. 

""One problem with BMI is that it does not distinguish between muscle and fat."" No shit, Sherlock. The whole point of BMI is to estimate a body fat range. 

**Article 2:** Again, yes, there are more accurate methods of estimating body fat (like the ones I recommended for you). 

""For example, a person with exceptional muscle tone and low fat is more likely to have a higher BMI compared to someone with higher fat and lower muscle tone..."" Interesting how all of these articles choose to mention this end of BMI's inaccuracy, when it the opposite is usually true: A person with a normal BMI who, in reality, has excess body fat. I particularly like how this article chooses to mention that ""many professional football players' BMIs would place them in the obese category"", as though professional athletes are analogous to the average adult. 

The article fails to cite the study which supposedly concludes ""Nearly half of those whose BMIs labeled them as overweight were actually healthy, according to data on their other health measures."" What other health measures? How many of them did a subject have to pass in order to be considered ""healthy"" or ""unhealthy""? Did the article examine the correlation with actual body fat percentage, or just try to argue that being overweight wasn't unhealthy?

**Article 3:**  I like how this article is titled ""How Accurate Is Body Mass Index, or BMI?"", yet never answers its own question. This one also uses professional athletes (Michael Jordan!) as an example of extreme outliers, implying this could somehow be the norm. Mostly, though, this is just a few recommendations for further action a person can take, *in addition to* looking at their BMI. 

**Article 4:**  Titled ""How Accurate is BMI?"" with a sub-heading of ""Is BMI reliable as an indicator of body fat?"", this page also fails to answer both questions. It instead describes, in vague and relative terms, where outliers can exist. It gives zero statistics for their prevalence. 

""...which is why muscular athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscle rather than additional body fat."" I'm noticing a trend here. 

**Article 5:** ""Why BMI Isn‚Äôt The Best Measure for Weight (or Health)"" (I never said it was), cites a study which found the following: ""Among the study participants, about half of women who were not classified as obese according to their BMI actually were obese when their body fat percentage was taken into account. Among the men, in contrast, about a quarter of obese men had been missed by BMI."" This supports my point. 

The article concludes with: ""So without a viable way to change how we measure body fat, for now, BMI is the best option."" It also mentions other tests which should be paired with this estimate to give a bigger picture of overall health. No argument there; completely reasonable. 

&gt;just pointing out that I'm not obese by any stretch of the imagination. 

You're obese by a remarkably accurate estimation. Prove me wrong, by a more accurate measurement. And, if your doctor knows with such certainty that you're not obese, what measurement did *he* use to determine that?",1559347218

(B) appear to be intended ‚Äî

In 2016, a US-backed Saudi coalition was found to have [bribed members of Al Qaeda](https://www.apnews.com/f38788a561d74ca78c77cb43612d50da) to ‚Äúsecure victories‚Äù against them. The clear motive of such actions was to increase favorability with the Yemeni population and its government, opening the populace up to exporting oil and buying American products. This act alone defines the US as an ‚Äòinternational terrorist‚Äô under its own law:

‚ÄúAct dangerous to human life‚Äù - bribing a group that has killed and continues to kill innocent civilians is most definitely dangerous to human life

‚ÄúViolation of the criminal laws of the United States‚Äù - providing support for Al Qaeda is a [violation of the PATRIOT act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providing_material_support_for_terrorism) 

‚ÄúIntended to influence the policy of a government‚Äù - increasing support of the Yemeni government by ‚Äúridding‚Äù villages of Al Qaeda to make them more economically friendly toward the US

‚ÄúOccur primarily outside the US‚Äù - the bribery took place in Yemen.

The US defines itself as an international terrorist.

I I started as an end-user for a short time. Basic admin stuff. No scripting knowledge, only really doing things like form configurations, KB articles/management, building reports, workflows, and catalog items. I got a job as a junior TC at a gold partner just over three years ago and started learning as fast as I could. It felt like drinking from a fire hose. I got poached by a bronze partner about a year ago and went from junior to mid-level with a big pay increase. I feel like I‚Äôve barely been doing this very long at all, but I‚Äôve learned a ton, gotten a few certs, and am now a certified instructor for SNOW. You really can move up incredibly fast if you put the work in. 

I can‚Äôt agree more with what /u/theRealPancakeMix said about the time management stuff. Making the jump from end-user to partner took a lot of getting used to. The pace is a lot faster and more demanding, at least in my experience. 

Also, if you have web dev experience and like doing that sort of thing, I highly recommend learned as much about portal as you can and getting those skills up. There‚Äôs a constant shortage of folks who are good at portal and you‚Äôll be in higher demand.",1559347219

"prolife","t5_2qscv","* shrug*, I'd rather be a murderer than be dead cause I committed suicide.

&gt;who has it's own unique DNA and genetic material

Is this something you expect to have any kind of emotional resonance with prochoicers? Because it almost never does.

&gt;The life of a rape baby does not matter less than that of a consent baby,

I agree. But I value my own life over both, and I would choose my own well being over being physically and phycologically tortured for 9 months straight. 

&gt;convienant

An interesting way to describe the experience of being raped and then growing the product of that rape inside you for 9 months, never getting to forget or put the rape out your mind for a second. Really goes to show the level of empathy you have for people in that situation.

&gt;In 100 years, they will look back at us and wonder how we let 4 times the number of people killed in the Holocaust be murdered.

My dad was (10-15 years ago) a live animal re-seller (he was buying en-gross from big farms and was selling by piece in markets), so he knows 99% of what a vet can do to treat a sick animal, and when he is unsure, he still has his vet friends that helped him while he was working, so they can help him (mostly for free, or favor for favor).

Same thing for animal food, we know where to buy ingredients to make a quality forage (that is the base for a healthy animal diet) + the rest of what an it needs as food. For example pigs are some sort of house sanitizers, aside from lucerne, forage, grass or whatever it's in their menu, we gave them a ""snack"" between the 2 set daily meals, whatever stew  or soup was close to go bad or we wouldn't eat it anymore, we would dilute it with some water, then add it dry bread (we could get for very cheap from a bakery) and give it to them.

 I don't want to be shifting the goalposts. I uphold my statement with the edit when it comes to the word ""bad""

&gt;Pretty ambiguous. Murder is interacting with other members of our social group ergo moral. How much more are you going to change or water down your argument down to justify the consequences of your worldview?

You misinterpreted what I said. Morality helping us in our human interactions does not mean that every interaction is morally good. 

Also I am willing to change my mind or alter my view if I have been convinced to do so. You are attacking my beliefs and I thank you for that. I do not see why you would hold that against me. 

&gt;You keep typing the claim but can‚Äôt defend it. Typing it over and over doesn‚Äôt make it true and the evidence is against you so I‚Äôm not convinced

Then let's examine the statement in detail. 

&gt;Many parts vary although there are distinctive similarities when it comes to key points

Nearly every country that exists today views murder as bad and has laws against murder. The definitions of murder may vary but on the whole murder is sanctioned. What this means is that despite various differences between societies we can all mostly agree that murder is bad.

As far as I can tell, they only ever heard from family members of missing and murdered women and community advocates, never really bothering to talk to police, or Crown prosecuters, or judged involved in cases.

It's great that the families had a chance to tell their stories, but that's nothing to base any conclusions on beyond maybe how better to deal with victims' families.

it isnt that hard to figure out and people should not make up stories why illegal immigration bothers them.  based on [haidt's five moral foundations](http://www.ethicsdefined.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Lib_VS_Cons.png) you can see who is gonna feel what about illegal immigration.",1559347222

You asked within the context of the back/forth we were having about Andrew Jackson, you followed up your two questions with this clarification.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I‚Äôm not talking about he Indian removal act.   
&gt;  
&gt;I‚Äôm talking about Andrew  Jackson‚Äôs political ambitions and policies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I responded 

 

&gt;Okay the IRA is out, so ....  
&gt;  
&gt;Then which exact policy are you referencing as advocating for genocide if you are not being specific to the Indian Removal Act?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is where you stalled out.

&amp;#x200B;

Look if you were just blowing smoke and don't know of any policies that affirm your assertions its cool, people repeat things they hear or read all the time without fact-checking. People are trusting and things that confirm their bias often slip by easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

As to your little deflection-  as an on the fly question-

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone who is into Texas politics knows GWB isn't a racist, W loves him some POC even more than Poppy. I do think it is worth mentioning that while not a racist, he was raised to be an elitist albeit he is far less pretentious than his ancestors. Bushes just seem to get weaker each generation from the lock-step shit Sam, Prescott and GHWB toed. Lil' P trying hard to find his place in a world that is drastically seeing all things Bush uprooted. Texas will be better off once free of that family.",1559347222

"MentalHealthSupport","t5_35ulb","So, because you're looking for advice here, I would suggest:
1. Tell your psyc dr it's not going to work and see if they suggest someone else since you didnt click with this person. 
2. Give her a review on Google, WebMD, and/or the clinics website. There are other things you could look up like ""how to rate my counselor"" which is like a Google review but I'm not sure what you're area is. 
3. Def give this therapist the ""benefit of the doubt"" because if their job is to listen to people all day, they may carry baggage. Granted that doesnt give them a reason what so ever to treat people this way but think ""Maybe she had a really bad day"". This way you may have a clearer mind and do kinda of like a ""forgive and forget"" so that way you can move on from this mess. 
4. Find someone else, whether that be from your psyc dr's office or even a simple Google search that specializes in your diagnosis. When you do find this next person, be sure to be upfront about your insecurities- like not wanting to be told off the bat what you're doing wrong. I say this because I have similar issues. I dont like being told what I'm doing wrong in a harsh way. I like to figure them out for myself which is what a counselor should do and then help you build a foundation of how to figure it out using skills and techniques that help YOU. So like once you figure out some of the depression, it may motivate you to get a job that works for you. 

Counselors are always booked out and, honestly, they are hard to find. Especially good ones but never loose hope! Trust me, they are out there. You have to be willing to work hard to find them and willing to work with them. We are only getting your perspective on this matter too. But, keep your head up! Counseling is a long process and that's totally ok. The first step is what you're taking and that is getting help. From here on out itll be a cake walk once you are stable or clearer in the mind. Best of luck, my heart goes out to you!",1559347222

I tend to be less negative after I exercised before and if I didn't, I feel like I am confined in a shell and I will not engage in a non-exciting conversation. Endorphins are released after the exercise and they create a fake state of happiness. This by itself makes you more pleasant and more likable as a person.

Exercise helps you fix your posture. Don't expect results if you play games all day in the computer and walk with a hunched back like Quasimodo.

Woohoo, finally done with the history log! It only took more than a week to finish that massive project, but I'm really happy with the results and it'll mean getting more data from runs/scoresheets/leaderboards. (I wrote a description of the process and content on Patreon, and will eventually do some sort of write up for the blog as well.)

* [History log sample output](https://i.imgur.com/zMRw8G5.png)

It does a lot more than that, but that's a decent example of the first half of a short run.

On the blog I put up a new article covering the [evolution and characteristics of Cogmind's turn time system](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2019/04/turn-time-systems/).

* [Debug visualization of relative entity time](https://i.imgur.com/AzRH9Cr.gif)

There's also a bit of talk about optimization.

I also published another article for patrons, about [Special Game Modes in a Roguelike Context](https://i.imgur.com/1xq9jed.png). Got to do some fun research for that one, looking into other roguelikes as well.

I streamed again this week, part of which involved provoking a never-before-seen confrontation between Cogmind's two largest combat bots. Zyalin did his thing and recorded the event with this great piece:

* [The biggest one repeatedly intercepted incoming nukes xD](https://i.imgur.com/nyRnU2r.jpg)
* [Another Zyalin piece celebrating the community's favorite cheer](https://i.imgur.com/iM3E9Rz.jpg)

After finishing the history log, it's been good to finally get to work on something else for a change, and I'm actually adding content again! A new system, to be precise, although not too precise because it's top secret and I'll be demo-ing it on stream probably in a couple weeks :P

Another thing I worked on: More stuff related to Relay Couplers, like [this new hack](https://i.imgur.com/5M7TphA.gif) that lists the couplers currently installed in this Garrison Access point.

Aaaaand last night there was an issue with my website, making it impossible to upload scores and do game version checks. Spent a few hours troubleshooting that to no avail, it seemed like a server-side issue (since I changed nothing on my end...) and tech support said they'll have an admin look at it. Well I got up this morning and now it's even worse :/. The wiki and blog are both down because apparently the server's PHP installation is also messed up somehow. Great :(

If Michael Afton really went through the effort of renaming himself to Fritz Smith, then he might as well be every single player in the goddamn franchise. Michael being the player of every game ruins the charm of it. No character development, no personalities, no different motives, it's the same shit and it's boring. It's not interesting. It's stale and BORING. You thought Fazbear Entertainment was a problem for the public? NOPE! Turns out the killer's dumbass immortalized cyborg son was the asshat that did the spring cleaning for him!

2: That's... Dumb. We're told Michael WANTS to find his dad, not that he already did. What would even be the point of telling us he wants to find his dad if he already did? That's very flawed writing if that's the case.

After rejection these days I instantly start looking for the next option/opportunity which is hard because at times it seems like there is no such thing.

However I know from reading and listening to extremely successful people to even moderately successful people that NOT giving up is the very thing that allowed them to find their success.

Sounds like some bullshit I know, but if we want something bad enough, we will find a way. There‚Äôs too many people in history that have proven this thus far.

I mean Jim Carey was homeless before he put a smile on the worlds face and even Abraham Lincoln almost committed suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

The reflex being, when someone presents with a mental illness; ""you need drugs and therapy"" (or in the worst cases, ""here take these drugs""). Yes, sure some drugs work for some people sometimes. Yes therapy works for some people sometimes. However, there are a lot that it doesnt, because the life they are going back to is a total mess, and is never looked at in the medical model.

&amp;#x200B;

The reliance on ""drugs and therapy"" like a mantra, at the top of the mental health ideological food chain, is that because it is repeated so often, and by so many people, so much of the time, it takes away focus from the much broader range of social issues that impact and perpetuate mental illness.

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","The *reason* men are shut-ins and have increasingly abandoned work in Japan *is* the nature of the work itself, and what rearing a family actually demands.  Forty-eight-hour workdays, crushing overtime, absenteeism, *kar≈çshi*, and their own fathers' example are more than enough to have them rejecting that conventional life.

Their parents are miserable.  Their families are miserable.  Men toil in offices performing busywork for no other reason than a herd culture built around shame and perpetual grinding ambition 'til they hit retirement age, whereupon they step into a house that's been little more than a glorified weekend hotel where their wife has largely been a chambermaid for the past forty years with whom they've had their compulsory two-and-a-half children.  And then they wait for death.

Japan is a crushingly unhappy country, and it's not because women are unavailable.  The opposite phenomenon has happened: The precondition for *having* a traditional relationship and material prosperity is rejecting a personal life, so men and women alike are- if you'll excuse the phrase- going their own way and just saying, No, to marriage and children.

And what's tragic is that soaplands, pink salons, and the demented hostess phenomenon all accentuate that what Japanese men **really** want is actually warmth and intimacy.  One of the most popular ""treatments"" at any pink salon is kissing a girl or holding hands.  The most successful hostesses can pull down millions of yen a *night* and sometimes even real estate and cars just by drinking with a lonely miserable businessman, petting his hair while he sets his cheek on their lap, and giving them a hug.  Sex **rarely** is a part of that.

If anything, it's *women* who want sex because they're so starved for that in Japan.  There's been an astronomical growth in gigolos and male prostitutes in recent years, especially among foreigners whom they fetishize as having huge cocks and being better lovers than Japanese men.

If this dullard thinks sex-gynoids would incentivize hard work in Japan, and that *anime* is reality, he's clearly dumber than the average incel; that's quite a feat.  If the government promised all of what this dingus thinks they want to *sararimen*, the MHLW minister would be an overnight laughingstock.",1559347230

"AskScienceDiscussion","t5_2vlah","What I said was ""quantity of energy that exists in a system"". If you measured energy only with a thermometer, when you set a log on fire it would appear that you were creating energy from nothing. What I mean is that if you have a system that you keep closed (which isn't strictly possible but we can get close enough) and you set things on fire or throw them at walls or perform nuclear fission or whatever, there is some quantity that is conserved throughout all processes and constrains many properties of the systems. We call that quantity energy. There's no obvious equivalence between chemical bonds in an object and the thermal energy contained in the system's temperature, we have to infer that there is an equivalence. And to some extent saying that there is some specific amount of joules of energy in the system is just a mathematical shorthand for describing a more complex reality, but it's a model that allows us to predict real events; similarly, defining reference frames is a mathematical shorthand, but it predicts real time dilation that has been observed so reliably and regularly that it's less likely to be an error than the vast majority of scientific measurements ever made.

I mean, you don't even have to get into special relativity to use reference frames. Ever drop an object in a car and notice that it doesn't fly back even though the car is moving forward? We could describe why this happens by accounting for how all the momentum is conserved and all the objects interact in the system and so on, but it's more convenient just to model the car as its own reference frame, and all the math works out to produce exactly identical results. That's basically what we're doing with special relativity. The reference frames aren't physical objects that exist somewhere, they're useful ways to describe systems.",1559347231

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","It's interesting you should say that, because in the early 19th century, ""ain't"" was a regular part of the upper-class vocabulary in England. Also common was the (by today's standards) misuse of ""was"" in the second person; if someone was telling you about some event that happened, for example, you (as an upper-class English person) would ask ""Was you there?"" and not ""Were you there?""

Over time, ""ain't"" drifted down the ladder of the English class system and came into wider use by lower-class people, at which point the upper classes stopped using it and it picked up the connotation of being a fake or incorrect word.

This is a fairly common pattern in language, manners, and fashion:  something that's seen as a sign of high status only stays that way as long as it's exclusive to actual high-status people. Once it sees wider adoption, high-status people abandon it and even start shunning it, and come up with something else to set themselves apart.",1559347235

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Player A is like one of my friends, same situation and it's annoying but we can handle it

Player B is like my friend's gf but she doesn't flake so we can put up with her

Player C should've put away his phone and straight up been kicked out when he decided to watch porn during play. absolutely disgusting.

Player D seems to have some problems but those can normally be handled through some more light-hearted one shots to make him loosen up and it seemed like him being late was not typical for him

but frankly because of Player E who should never have been allowed in the group and her being another problem that comes with Player D they both should've been kicked from the group

So where does that leave us? everyone except your SO should've been kicked and playing 1 on 1 isn't that great. Definitely the right call.

My group started with me, my brother, and a friend who came up with the idea to play DnD and has since expanded to include 3 more people, the friend's new GF, another close friend, and a friend of the other guy who I didn't know until we started playing. Over time we've let go of 2 players we've had in the past because they were consistently late and the one we were already getting ready to set some ground rules for because they couldn't handle playing the same character for 4 sessions and felt the need to play expressly play fetish races because he was a gay guy with parental issues and felt the need to constantly push his perversion into the spotlight and change his identity both in game and in real life",1559347236

`Establish the Fair Opportunities Act.`

With the order given, hundreds of business owners, both big and small, received news that they would no longer be able to require all their workers to have any years of experience before starting work, as well as provide a pay proportional to the work done by the workers, which was calculated by the government. Many big companies tried to offer large sums of money to ensure the Act would not pass, forgetting completely that OneSoul was an extremely sophisticated computer algorithm, as intelligent and competent as a Human being, but not limited by biases or subjectivity. Those same corporations which refused to accept the Act found themselves with just enough money to maintain a dollar store, and the rest of their former possesions were put under government control.

`Help the unproductive.`

With the extra money available, OneSoul started funding a massive program to help the poor into the workforce. By interfering in the housing market, OneSoul used the extra money to personally buy many vacant houses which it then gave to the poor, but not before explaining in detail to the masses how to live in these strange new places. Soon, the poor started getting more and more jobs, aided by the Fair Opportunities Act. Economic activity flourished as a result, and many poor areas started seeing better quality of life.

`Focus on international unity.`

The third major decision made by OneSoul was the refocusing of funding from Defense into literally every other department, which included Education, Science, Medical Care, etc. This was done worldwide as the outbreak of the Second Cold War in 2045 had every nation on their toes. This decision helped everyone immensly, as money was no longer being used to create new ways to kill, but to create new ways to effectively apply knowledge, learn about the universe, cure diseases, etc. Only a year after the decision, a universal cure for cancer was developed.

`Annihilate ignorance.`

Many fringe groups took this as an attack on themselves, and they were partially right. Partially because the attack wasn't actually an attack, but rather a series of specialized teams of operatives whose mission was to go to communities with low education rates and high levels of ignorance and teach them the truth. This was a more controversial one, as many cultural norms were violated across the globe, but these persistent teams eventually succeded. By the year 2100, things like racism, sexism, class discrimination and chauvinism were a thing of the past, while love for one's own country and nation swelled in popularity in a positive, wholesome way that outright rejected the notion that one culture was superior to another.",1559347236

Making sure you've at least quickly looked at all 5 choices and have a reason to eliminate each is also a big help. Was doing an inference question yesterday with a student where C sure looked good, and then D and E did as well. Two of them came out because when you went back and looked very carefully, what the AC said was not \*quite\* what the stimulus referred to.

Yeah, **'NEWT'S TALE'** was pretty bad.

I think **'EARTH WAR'**, **'HIVE'** &amp; **'NEWT'S TALE'** take the ranks for the worst art in the **ALIEN** comic series chronology. Some of the early issues of **'COLONIAL MARINES'** are pretty KENNER-ish too.

**'DEAD OBIT'** is a close contender as well.

&gt; A shame given how utterly gorgeous the cover art is on each of them.

Agreed. Same thing with **'NEWT'S TALE'** Bolton's extraordinary covers actually make the artwork even MORE disappointing.

Here we have this splendid cover presented to us:

&gt; The lawyers had asked Stephanie Hofeller Lizon to provide &amp;quot;Any storage device&amp;quot; containing redistricting-related documents left by her estranged father, Thomas Hofeller, a Republican consultant who specialized in gerrymandering.

&gt; There are sure to be more revelations from the Hofeller files to come, driving home the downside of using a single consultant to mastermind redistricting across multiple states and decades.

Mercy is natural born genius trained by the full resources of a monarch and has a weapon bounded to her soul that was used by her mother till Archlord both lindon and yerin haven‚Äôt even begun to see just how skilled she is and because of that dross most definitely doesn‚Äôt have a counter in place for her. That thought leads me Yerins biggest disadvantage against Lindon which is that Lindon has watched her fight for years and is already familiar with her techniques and dross most certainly has a profile on yerins fighting style completed from all the times they fought as skysworn true gold or when she fought against the seishan underlords. Yerins advantage of her steelborn body being amplified even furthe r by soulfire than most other underlords and her blood shadow being her match in power makes her incredibly powerful, but I don‚Äôt believe sufficiently so to defeat Lindon in a bloodlusted death match.  As for Yerin vs Mercy Yerin most likely doesn‚Äôt even know half of Mercy‚Äôs abilities considering she herself didn‚Äôt have acces to many of them because of her being sealed, but the same lack of information can not be said about Mercy regarding Yerin as she has watched Yerin fight her hardest multiple times.

Main points Lindon loses to Mercy because of lack of information and skill, Lindon beats Yerin because of high information. Over all with no information on the enemy Yerin is definitely a better fighter than Lindon is though.",1559347238

Between Who's the Boss, Evil Geniuses, The Family, Korruption, Founding Fathers, Critically Acclaimed, Ethan+Jeanine, Howard+Franco, and some I'm probably forgetting, the teams division is stacked with possibilities.

yours: Thought I knew where it was going. I was wrong. Tired of EVERYONE doing that style, but that's because so few do it well. 

You, Sir, can rap. The autotune doesn't feel like it's compensating for someone who can't sing and wont attempt a flow--It actually DOES enhance instead of sounding hackneyed BECAUSE it's clear you're a good rapper with or without it. Kudos.

My advice is on the production side, and take with a grain of salt because production is changing so much nowadays.
-the 808 sounds like it's so loud it's muddying up and making EVERYTHING ELSE weaker. I'd turn it down and get that distortion from a plugin (hell, Fruity Fast Dist does a serviceable job) instead of redlining. I realize a lot of producers are doing this nowadays though, and this may just be my artistic preference.

-voice sounds a little too low (in straight volume), and lacks ""shine""--I think your autotune plugin is robbing your voice of a lot of it. Maybe experiment with an eq boost for the highs after your autotune plugin in the chain.

Your voice mixing isn't even ""bad"". Just think a few more touches would make it sit better. Certified good shit though--again because you're a good vocalist and the autotune isn't a crutch like 99% of people who utilize it.",1559347240

Like karmawhores people on other platforms just have one purpose, become known/popular because that equals power

Every game has its own type of clickbait, designed specifically to attract the attention of that games population, but only works for games that are popular, because if you had the chance to make 100$ in one week or 1$ in one month, what would you choose? Popular games give you more views as there is more population, and if you do your job well, you can get thousands of views on a completely nonexistent content

"intermittentfasting","t5_2tluu","I walked 25 miles in my hiking boots easily, my SO once did that in motorbike boots because he forgot the proper boots, that wasn't nice, their purpose is drastically different... We are used to walks.
Walking is nice, I just don't do it for very long distances (I didn't find and English word for what we have in this country. Lots of not-competitions, we follow a route, start at different times and need to finish in a limited but more than enough time. There are every kind of distances, the longest ones takes more than 24hours to walk. well, no, I don't do those, I want to sleep in my own bed at night, thank you but I don't even want to walk from dawn to dusk, it's not fun after 20-25 miles and I do it for fun, not to show how hero I am, that's cool too but not for me) and nowadays I do only really short ones, a few miles only.
My shoes are probably for some light hiking...? But they are light and okay, it will be fine.
I walked and run a little in my proper, stronger, heavier hiking boots today, everything is super wet now.
I live near a lake on top of a hill :) It's a nice place but it's still a good idea to run when we are elsewhere too (I actually did that once, I remember now... But I usually don't have my light shoes then, hiking in the mountains is better in my boots. Maybe next time I get a bit lighter hiking boots?). But I like this place, I have my usual walks, I see the same places and I never get bored of it, there are birds and everything changes anyway. It's not the best for running though, very uneven roads, too high grass, now water everywhere... But there are better places, my SO runs through a forest in a wildlife park to work. I cycled there today. There was too much mud. Oh, still pretty, I can't ever get enough of that place... Yes, I will think about new routes.

&gt; The lawyers had asked Stephanie Hofeller Lizon to provide &amp;quot;Any storage device&amp;quot; containing redistricting-related documents left by her estranged father, Thomas Hofeller, a Republican consultant who specialized in gerrymandering.

&gt; There are sure to be more revelations from the Hofeller files to come, driving home the downside of using a single consultant to mastermind redistricting across multiple states and decades.

&gt; The voting rights advocates in possession of the Hofeller collection have not yet revealed the full extent of the files.

So we met in the park, in broad daylight. He was pouring the drinks. The last thing I remember was thinking that I wasn't attracted to him. Next thing I woke up with him in my bed. I still can't remember the part in between and I don't want to. Fortunately, I have tested negative for STDs afterwards, but I will never forgive myself for going against my gut feeling to cancel the date. And I'll never forgive myself for allowing a guy I didn't know to pour my drinks. Really stupid.

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","I'm empathetic that you are feeling down despite having the best of intentions. You say this teacher is well respected and an established quality teacher. Perhaps you need to listen to what they are telling you and read the room. Instead of focusing on being hurt, focus on the content of what they were saying. Where their points actually valid based on their experience?

If your keys are jingling too loud--FIX IT! Get a softer key chain. PROBLEM SOLVE if you are causing problems. If your behaviors are annoying other people....self-reflect, grow, and stop being annoying. The first year of teaching has a HUGE learning curve. While your perspective may be valid that this teacher could have communicated with you in a kinder way, perhaps it was more how you said than what you said that caused their reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 15+ teacher who is constantly frustrated by the incompetence of the teachers around me. If you are making mistakes---big or small---fix them and then don't do them again. Especially if other teachers (like this one?) are left to clean up you messes.

For awhile I was trying to find a place that would do custom laser cut ""Fred Sled"" or like a cool ass dragon or something.  I still periodically scour eBay for a red dragon decal that's long and skinny and could go on my downtube for my gravel bike which is also an unbranded open mold (Miracle CX535)

I wanted something on the wheels, didn't really care what, but laser cutting something custom seemed a little too expensive and I didn't want to try to hand cut vinyl. I saw someone had replacement DTSwiss decals on the cheap so I just went with it. Whatever, I don't care. You can barely see them unless you're 3 fr away anyway.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Dany and Sansa are two sides to this coin. While you might see female agency being stripped from Dany as she mentally collapses, Sansa's story is the inverse.

Dany starts from shitty beginnings but then enjoys a relatively uninterrupted upward trajectory until she mentally breaks when it appears her confidantes are lost to her or abandoning her. The lone wolf dies but the pack survives, right?

Then we have Sansa. A privileged child destined to be an ornamental princess who sees that fantasy future devolve into abuse beyond the worst Dany ever felt. But Sansa, through that, gains a power and agency consistent with Martin's world and message. Sansa had strong foundations and reliable allies. Dany had but lost those things. No matter what Sansa wasn't alone in the world permanently but Dany, at least as she perceived it, was perpetually betrayed and abandoned.

There were always differences in what leadership would mean to the two of them. Dany, in her quest to get what was owed to her, developed more and more violent ways to get it. Sansa though, appeared to see ruling as a responsibility she owed to the people rather than something the people owed to her.

Set against the backdrop of various other female rulers like Olenna or Cersei, who were more power-behind-the-throne types, they are both studies in how marginalised identities can wield power in a world designed around wealth and status, vested traditionally in males. 

Sansa ends on a throne and Dany doesn't because Martin is making a broader commentary on what it takes to gain and maintain power in a pragmatic or utilitarian world, which is a pretty broad theme across all rulers in the series regardless of their background. He simply doesn't believe pure-hearted, effective rulers can exist.",1559347246

However, it is not enough to warrant a ban for another account that from all our own records has not done anything wrong, i.e. did not receive any RMT. De facto, there was no T+C violation. (edit: see update below, we'll leave up the original wording for transparency)

More importantly, we cannot and should not ban accounts solely on the basis of 3rd party material, this would be a very dangerous precedent on which a lot of 'out of game' PvP could be based. And we have seen a lot of this over the years.

Update on the above: 

Sorry for the confusion, turns out I did not have all the information due to everyone being out of the office at this time of the day.

Being proprietary wouldn't stop it from being reverse engineered and, again, if two teams have done it this close together it's not going to be that hard to replicate.

They didn't create anything, the arms race was already here and has been for a long time. Chat/spam bots have existed for as long as the internet. Being more prevalent means more awareness, there's no denying that simple fact. There's also no stopping this technology, you can't just wish it away. It's here to stay and going to get better and better, the only question is will it be available to everyone to try to tackles the problems it creates or kept in a few select hands to abuse.

&gt;The study demonstrates that this algorithm writes fake news that is more effective than human-written propaganda.

No, it doesn't. It's worse than human written fake news but can marginally improve existing human written propaganda by rewriting it.

The bottom line is hysterics is going to get you no where and your proposed solution is worse: you're proposing less transparency, less opportunity for other motivated individuals to pick this stuff apart and come up with detection solutions, and the concentration of any influence created by these techniques into fewer hands.

You can freak out all you want but it's not going away, this was always going to happen, and the absolute *worst* outcome for AI is for a few people to control it.",1559347248

Yes, you can drain and fill the transmission without dropping anything. There‚Äôs a fill bolt and drain bolt on the outside of the transmission, on the driver side. Plenty of DIYs on ClubRSX if you‚Äôre not certain, but I promise it‚Äôs an easy job; just like changing motor oil. 

Dropping and installing the transmission isn‚Äôt that difficult, but will take the better part of a day, since you have to lower the subframe to wiggle it out. But after that, removing it is just a handful of bolts. The clutch, pressure plate, and flywheel are also easy to replace once the transmission is removed. 

I took my transmission to a specialist to have it serviced and inspected since I had no history of the car until that point, and was interested in seeing what kind of shape it was in. The specialist was a dealer for MFactory, and charged me $630 for just the LSD; IIRC it‚Äôs $700 retail. The Spoon final drive was shipped from Japan and was the cheapest option at the time at just over $300. 

Both the LSD and final drive will require dropping and opening up the transmission, which is why I recommend saving up and having it all done at once, since it‚Äôs *a lot* of work. If this is your only car, I suggest preparing for at least two weeks with the car on stands; longer if you‚Äôre doing it yourself. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say transmission work is hard, just exceptionally tedious and crucial in attention to detail. One little thing out of place could lead to one thing or another, and you have to drop the trans again just to work on it. 

It doesn‚Äôt take much in the way of tools; just Hondabond to seal it back up and a lot of time and patience. You want to do it right the first time, since fixing mistakes take so much more effort. 

I paid about $1600 in parts and labor for a *really good* specialist to take apart the trans, inspect it, replace all the bearings and seals, install the LSD, swap out the final drive, and install the FA5 6th gear. Got a shiny, chemical washed trans back in about a week with zero problems since. 

It is expensive for someone else to do, which again, is why I suggest you take care of as many things at once to save on time and money. It becomes a lot easier to stomach if you already have issues with your 2nd/3rd gear or if you need a clutch/pressure plate replacement.",1559347250

&gt; James Todd Smith (born January 14, 1968 in Bay Shore, New York), better known as LL Cool J (Ladies Love Cool James),  is a Grammy Award winning American rapper and actor signed to Def Jam. He has released twelve studio albums over his 27 year career, has starred in numerous feature films and currently plays Agent Sam Hanna on the hit show NCIS: Los Angeles.

&gt; Born in Bay Shore, New York, and raised between St. Albans, New York and Hollis, New York in the borough of Queens. The only child of Ondrea (n√©e Griffith) and James Smith, Jr. Smith is of both African American and Native American descent.  He spent his youth singing in the church choir, participating in the Boy Scouts and delivering newspapers.
Def Jam released his first record, the 12"" single ""I Need a Beat"" in 1983. The single sold over 100,000 copies. The success of ""I Need a Beat"" helped lead to a distribution deal with Def Jam and Columbia Records in 1985. Soon after, he dropped out of Andrew Jackson High School to record his debut album.

&gt; He is known for romantic ballads such as I Need Love and Hey Lover as well as pioneering hip-hop such as I Can't Live Without My Radio, I'm Bad, The Boomin' System, Mama Said Knock You Out, and 4, 3, 2, 1. L has also appeared in several films. LL Cool J is one of a few hip-hop stars of his era to sustain a successful recording career for more than two decades. He has released 12 albums and a greatest hits compilation so far, with his next album, Exit 13, set to be released in September, 2008. The album will be the last for LL's record deal with Def Jam Recordings, a deal which has lasted for over twenty two years, making it the longest single hip hop deal to date. He now resides in Manhasset, NY with his wife and four children. Read more on Last.fm.

Richard Spencer doesn't. Andrew Anglin doesn't. So since when have Fascists denied that their aims are racial? 

&gt; Taking an explicitly racist hyper-violent right-wing frat's word for whether they're fascists or not strikes me as incredibly naive.

They aren't explicitly racist. It isn't just that they say they aren't fascists. Its that the actual Fascists I know of who have spoken about them, by that I mean Morrakiu, hate them. If left-wingers think that you are a Fascist but avowed Fascists hate you, then you are parafascist in my mind. 

&gt; Like, ""libertarians actually have high-minded ideals and aren't simply a bunch of manbabies born on second base and sure they hit a double"" naive.

I have met Libertarians in real life. They weren't the way you claim them to be. 

&gt;Tucker is very explictly a fascist, as your own video shows. I'm not sure why you're denying it. You haven't shown any way in which the people you keep saying aren't ""really"" fascists differ from actual fascists.

What Makes Gavin MgGinnis not a Fascist is that he supports having a proposition nation. That and shoving a Dildo up his butt to prove that he isn't homophobic. That doesn't seem like something that a Fascist would do. With Tucker Carlson I think that he still believes in parliamentary democracy. So racist, yes. But that isn't sufficient to get you to Fascism. 

&gt;And yet, the vast majority of libertarians voted for and continue to support Trump. Have you ever actually read the comments on a reason.com article?

&gt;reason.com, by the way, is an astroturf propaganda magazine controlled by the Koch &gt;brothers, along with 95% of the the rest of public-facing libertarianism.

According to whom? How do you know that most libertarians voted for Trump and continue to support him? The Libertarians I know in real life hate him. And how do you know that Reason.com and the rest of public facing Libertarianism is astro-turf propaganda? 

&gt;What the hell are you trying to get across with this sentence? Libertarians constantly claim to believe in personal liberty, but when the rubber hits the road, the only personal liberty they *actually* care about is the liberty that effects them personally. That's why they'll vote for a piece of garbage like Trump - he'll lower their taxes while throwing brown kids in dog cages - and that's perfectly fine with your average libertarian.

&gt;You'll find more libertarians crusading to lower the age of consent than you will &gt;protesting the concentration camps along the southern border.

Again, the libertarians I know in real life don't act that way. So where are you getting this stuff? 

&gt;Bill Maher is a rock-dumb racist piece of shit, so he's in keeping with the theme as well.

I recommend you make an appointment to see a psychiatrist right away (call around, take the earliest appointment you can get so you've got one booked, keep calling other offices until you find one that can take you this week, check reviews of course). Tell them as much as they need to know on the phone so they will give you priority scheduling if they have it (some have it but don't advertise). In your appointment, tell them everything - you can even share your post here with them. 

I don't think you need to check yourself in to a hospital at this point, but if you start feeling like you need to defend yourself against these forces or other people, or if you start feeling you may need to injure or kill yourself for any reason, go to a hospital straight away and tell them everything.

You have done a great job being detailed and vulnerable in this post. I believe this means you have a terrific ability to introspect and be comfortable with your own experience and mind - clearly you're reaching the limits of that comfort zone, and you're doing the right thing to get help ‚Äì just please do know that you're far better equipped than most, and this can really work out to your advantage as you move forward.

These are the things in your post that strike me as not being in the real world, but rather a product of your brain, and you should absolutely tell a psychiatrist (a medical doctor, not a psychologist, not a therapist; though a psychologist or therapist may be helpful as well, a psychiatrist is necessary when you experience these kinds of non-real things):

* translucent static over everything
* outlines around everything 
* random outlines of random shapes
* ghostly shapes and movements 
* my brain makes associations that don't make sense to anyone else
* I get white noise when alone.
* on the streets I assume everyone is a murderous kidnapper
* laugh maniacally when I want to cry
* otherwise I show no emotions
* some invisible force that controls this dimension (I named them ""purgatory"") is responsible for all of this and any other pain I feel
* I was scared of the blanket

These are the things that seem to me to be reasonable responses given the experiences you've described:

* I was observing some of the aforementioned things around me, and I felt terrified of them. 
* I curled up in a blanket, but then  
* (Don't ask me why, I don't know either). 
* I felt myself trying to push the blanket away, but also wanting it to stay. 
* Every day feels like a unique version of hell, and every pleasure I receive is odd, obscure, or enveloped

I think anyone can do this if they train themselves, and you've probably trained yourself without thinking of it that way; it's just paying attention, and is a common practice in meditation:

"RiotFest","t5_2wqhk","My general festival guidelines from my experience at Riotfest/Rock on The Range/Sonic Temple festivals:  


1. Bring sun screen: You will be out in the sun for hours and it is a good idea to reapply throughout the day. 
2. Get a locker: It will be worth it to keep any merch you get and to have some supplies near by
   1. My normal locker supply list:
      1. Change of socks - If it rains then you will be able to change them and not have wet feet all show. 
      2. Baby wipes - This is good for a quick shower (especially after seeing GWAR)
      3. More sun screen - I only stress this because I am a very pale individual. 
3. Bring some form of bag (not sure on the Riotfest allowed items yet) to carry immediate supplies with you. 
4. Bring a poncho (it's going to rain)
5. Bring an empty water bottle to refill (if they allow it)
6. Make sure you take time to eat and stay hydrated.
7. Understand that you will have conflicts with bands playing and accept it. It sucks but you can't see every band at the fest. 
8. Have a plan about who you want to see, but also be flexible. Example: The last time I went, I really wanted to see Fitz and the Tantrums. They were horrible, so I popped over to see The Hives put on one of the best shows I have ever seen. 
9. Have a meetup spot with your group, and may it an easy landmark to find (Ferris Wheel, Lockers, etc). 
10. Most people are friendly, don't be afraid to say hello and make friends. 
11. Get there early and figure out where things are. Look for the refill stations, figure out where you can get the cheap food, etc. 
12. Join the Wall of Death for YMCA. 
13. Have a good time and enjoy the fest.",1559347252

"IronThroneRP","t5_345ny","*""Gods, he's really fucking drunk.""*

Keeping that thought to himself he went over to Mace's side and looped an arm around him.

""Trust me, Mace, you're no traitor. You've stayed true to the rightful King and in doing so you've actually created a great opportunity for peace.""

Assuming Mace submits, Orys would keep his arm in a brotherly embrace around him, leading him toward where other men had been sparring. It was a group of four split into pairs of two. Every now and then two of the same men from opposite pairs would glance menacingly at one another.

""You see those men? I gave them permission to fight it out. You see, they've been fighting for a girl. She's quite pretty, I must admit, but she can't make up her mind.""

With his freehand, he took a sip from his wineskin before continuing.

""And now they're training. The duel is slated for a few days from now. Whoever wins gets the girl.""

Casting a side glance at Mace, Orys suddenly turned serious in tone.

""These men are from very prominent merchant families. They certainly could have afforded to hire some men to settle this. Instead they've decided to settle it personally. No bloodshed necessary.""

Looking back to the men enduring their training, a smile came across Orys' face. There was honor in this. Hopefully Mace would see it too.

""I hope you can see what I'm getting at. I'd like for you to write to your father. Tell him that I wish to end this foolishness without any bloodshed. I'm inviting him and his army to King's Landing. They can stay within the walls. In exchange, I want us to end this rebellion one way or another: with a duel. The winner will spare the loser, as I'm sure neither of us would want to leave the other with fatherless children. My lovely daughter was only just born....""

Taking a deep breath, he finalized his thoughts.

""And the winner would get the Iron Throne.""",1559347253

"Shamanism","t5_2qieq","I just recently practiced two deep breath meditations at a festival that were very similar to the whim Hoff method but we started out straight away for 30 min.

We had some people recalling lost memories, having feeling for the first time in years in damaged fingers, people crying people laughing people screaming. We pretty much all had extreme tightening in our hands and arms while breathing, to the point of being uncomfortable but all while amazing music played and the instructor was giving encouraging words and reminded us anyone could stop at any time.

On the second practise I personally had recalled memories, and entered a very deep trance state to the point of not realizing I had stopped the breathing or any knowledge of time. 

Also we were by a beautiful lake in the shade of large trees.

It was an amazing experience and highly useful.

"numenera","t5_2w096","Light weapons have an advantage to scoring a hit built in (reduced difficulty by 1 step), so it might be better to use Effort to increase the damage dealt, for every level of effort spent; the attack's damage is increased by 3. And if you find you can't put a dent in somethings armor, it can still be helpful to attack. If 3 or more characters attack the same target, each character will gain a +1 to their attack roll. A character can fire a ranged light attack at a foe and miss on purpose inflicting no damage, but attempting to frighten or harass the foe, which causes the foe's next attack to be modified one step to it's detriment. 

There's also lots of story &amp; situational reasons a player can use to help them, I've had players use one turn to find where on a thick scaled creature the armor would be weakest, an intellect roll, and they find that the inside of it's elbows have a thinner bendable scale, so they strike there on their next turn, a speed task with one level of increased difficulty to the creature's level due to the smaller target, suddenly a dagger in the right place is a lot more deadly!",1559347256

After scrambling to get Alpha 1 last week, I was pretty tired - so I decided to take a week away from *One Knight in the Dungeon* and do recreational programming. I focused on solving a few issues I ran into in Nox Futura and never solved (because they were really low priority).

**Planets are, in fact, surprisingly round**

[Screenshots are here](https://imgur.com/a/G1V6BF9).

The first problem that has been bugging me for over two years is that *planets are spherical* (or close enough) - they wrap around, don't have seams (NF tries to hide the seam!). Since worldgen always starts with a noise map (well, several - but I'm only using altitude for this experiment). So I decided to take a couple of sessions to learn about *spherical noise*. It turns out that Perlin does this rather well, but it's not entirely intuitive.

So to get an actual sphere, with all the properties I want, it turns out that I need to sample the noise function in 3D. And since the noise is mapped to an X/Y/Z coordinate scheme, I have to project the polar sphere surface coordinates into 3D space and sample that. You can do that with this bit of UE4 C++:

    static FVector SphereVertex(const float&amp; altitude, const float&amp; lat, const float&amp; lon) {
    return FVector(
    altitude * FMath::Cos(lat) * FMath::Cos(lon),
    altitude * FMath::Cos(lat) * FMath::Sin(lon),
    altitude * FMath::Sin(lat)
    );
    }

Then you pick a constant altitude to sample (I went with `100.f`, which gives nice world with my various octaves/gain/lucanarity settings from NF). You iterate through latitude and longitude (with however many points you want to sample; I went with 512 samples of each axis to make a pretty sphere) and that gives you an altitude number - and wraps beautifully.

To keep the test/demo simple, I just splatted these into a `UProceduralMeshComponent` with vertex coloration picked by altitude. Normals are simply the direction from the center at that point (and my tangents are probably wrong, but since I'm not using them I didn't worry too much). Texture coordinates - also not used - are a simple `(lon + 180.f) / 360.f, (lat + 90.f) / 180.f` - that is, a simple linear mapping. I initially tested Mercator projection, which works well for 2D maps - but distorts the size of cells. So while it isn't entirely accurate, it's good enough (TM).

The cloud layer is generated in the same way, but sampling at a different altitude and using the resultant value as a *density*.

The results are pretty good - and mathematically stable, the same seed gives the same planet each time. I didn't spend any time optimizing, so it loads a little slowly (about 2 seconds) - but it renders nice and fast once it's going.",1559347257

I have this reddit set on ‚Äúmost recent,‚Äù check in a few times a day, and in the past week I‚Äôve seen maybe what, 3 true solos tops? Including one today. 

Just one.

Today.

I was also carefully watching the solo runs for Sabnock and the entire time there were a total of what, maybe 10 runs?
Compared to dozens of meme posts about how hard Nightmare was, about how easy the other difficulties were... All the same exact content but using different memes.

Let‚Äôs not even talk about how many solo posts there were during the entirety of the FEH collab. I saw maybe 5, but posts about how people were ruining Infernal runs? *Numerous.*

I mean I‚Äôm honestly curious about your thoughts:
If solo runs with a variety of strategies and characters (I highly doubt a Musashi vs. the Steel Golem could compare to a Celliera vs Steel Golem run) are ‚Äúspam‚Äù and a nuisance, then why are the dozens of meme posts, many of which are also just screenshots of the game with catchy titles, not?

Why is a 4-minute carefully planned run lesser than yet another post about not getting Mym after spending all their wyrmite in meme form?

And on top of that: Why is people posting *other* people‚Äôs art not considered spam when they didn‚Äôt even do any work outside of possibly asking the artist if they can link the art on the reddit?

Overall, I highly doubt Solo run videos are a legitimate nuisance, otherwise I‚Äôm sure the mods would have already implemented a new rule about them.

You have Rachael so you are guarenteed Liana or Tiaris in a focus in a month which are among the best units. Again you could prepare 50 Liana if you get her for Elwin while going for others on Valentines banners. You would have 50% chance at Shelfaniel which is a worse buffer than Luna in general and a worse mage than Lana in general. Angelina is a worse Cherie in general so you might just want to skip it and save up for the Rachael/Liana/Tiaris focus, Valentines, and Altemuller/Luna/Lanford. There is a Shelf/Angelina rate up after the Luna focus so you would have another shot at a princess buffer if you miss out on Luna.

With that, you can push your data to the bucket through the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/index.html).

If you have a local machine with enough storage, you do things like [host it as an FTP server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-vsftpd-for-a-user-s-directory-on-ubuntu-16-04).

Most civil rights organizations do not condone violence.

The fact that you compare Antifa to PETA means the propaganda is working. Antifa is *not* an organization. Just like Occupy was not an organization. Anti-fascism is a movement.

`Colonize the Sol system.`

Many were thrilled with the prospect of colonizing the solar system, which took only less than a century to do, as advancements in medicine allowed not only a much greater number of children to be born, but also the ability to perform abortions that didn't kill the fetus, which was grown in vats until maturity and then admitted into the global foster program, allowing for a massive population to emmigrate to colonies that had been pre-built by autonomous drones.

`Expand to the stars.`

There was much rejoicing across the Federation as OneSoul announced to the entire Sol system that its scientists have finally managed to develop actual faster-than-light travel. The first few tests were already done around the Oort Cloud, which only took 6 hours. The first manned starship was sent rocketing into space towards Alpha Centauri, and OneSoul wondered if there was a God, because if there was, it must be really proud.

Plot: A young man buys a new house against the advice of his overbearing mother. After falling through a hole in the basement, he finds himself in a mirrored duplicate of the house, dangling upside-down above a black void. Eventually, he discovers that the house isn't the only thing with a double.

Do you know how big this country is, and how small Seattle is? Seattle may have grown recently, but it's still a backwoods. I don't even think Seattle is a top 20 city by population. How is this little city going to solve the nation's homeless issue? San Francisco, a larger, richer, more liberal city couldn't  and can't. Los Angeles, the second largest city in the country couldn't and can't. What is Seattle going to do to solve the homeless issue while still being super duper compassionate?

It's an economics issue. If you were to put into place the fever dream of the most ideologically consistent Seattle Communist and bulldoze the Amazon campus and put into its place beautiful, concrete tenements for 20,000 people it doesn't solve the homeless issue in Seattle. Even if you made it as appealing to the homeless as you possibly could, and made the place rent free, rule free, inspection free, with safe injection/needle exchange sites on every floor, and had city officials fill everyone's refrigerators and pantrys everyday.... the streets are just going to fill with homeless again in a short amount of time. Trying to solve the homeless issue with compassion is like trying to drain the ocean with a tea cup.

A hyperspace ramming attack is still more effective, because it can be done from much farther away.

&gt; And as I said, we don't know if the ship hyper spacing would go through shields.

The Supremacy was in a combat situation, so its shields were definitely up. While the shields might have reduced the damage they still didn't prevent the ship from being crippled.

&gt; Also of note though is we do know that ISD have backup bridges , so in theory wiping out the bridge may just take them out of commission temporarily (unless they crash into something like in epVI).

Sure, but you don't need to completely destroy a ship for it to be really helpful in battle. Taking a ship out of commission temporarily will always give your side a significant advantage.",1559347264

"deathnote","t5_2riqp","As an anime only it‚Äôs bizarre to me the level of love Matt gets in fanart and stuff lol. He only appeared in like two scenes, and in one of them he was killed. I‚Äôve heard he has more scenes in the manga, but definitely from my perspective overrated.

As far as Rem being more interesting, I‚Äôd say that might be because she was more involved with what was happening in the story. Ryuk was very neutral, he didn‚Äôt intend to interfere at all, which makes him rather passive (until the end of course). I don‚Äôt disagree with you though, I really liked Rem. 

L honestly could have used some more development (seriously at least tell me his name in show, why do I have to look that up) but my favorite parts of the story involved him, so I guess I disagree with him being overrated?

I‚Äôve never considered it, but Naomi definitely was deserving of a spot in the task force had she been given the chance. I don‚Äôt think this is unpopular at all. She‚Äôs at least more deserving than her twat of a fianc√©e, who basically told her to shut up about her suspicions and only think of having kids and being a housewife. I‚Äôll never understand what she saw in someone like him, honestly. I really hated Pember. I never felt bad for him. 

Yotsuba arc definitely seemed slow, but I enjoyed seeing Light without his memories. It was a great what if scenario, to see him working with his arch rival. But I don‚Äôt think your opinion on this is unpopular, most people acknowledge this arc as being just alright.

I don‚Äôt dislike Near. But I don‚Äôt feel as strongly about him as L. Mello was more enjoyable to me than Near too, just based on the fact that he was a total rogue. He made everything more unpredictable, and he‚Äôs definitely not hiding off somewhere in a tower issuing orders. He was really in the nitty gritty of it. Still, hate Near? No, not really. Though they could have replaced him with L and pretty much nothing would be lost lol. Their personalities only had minor differences. 

As for the ending... I‚Äôve only watched the anime, but I‚Äôve  heard about how the manga ending is different. I know some people dislike the anime ending, or the fact that Light died at all, but I felt incredibly satisfied. It was sad, and emotional, and I felt bad for Light‚Äôs lost innocence. He didn‚Äôt have to destroy himself like he did, he didn‚Äôt have to be some martyr.  The anime ending had a lot of symbolism and was incredibly thematic. The sunset in the background representing the end of Kira‚Äôs reign, him dying in the middle of the stairs, symbolizing how he will go to neither heaven or hell, I just appreciated it a lot. From my understanding, the manga ending had Light die a much less glorious death. I think they both have their merits, though I think a lot of people prefer the manga ending. I enjoy both, just for the sake of being able to interpret the story in different ways.

Now, did Light DESERVE to win? No, lol. By the end of the series, he had really lost any moral high ground he had at the beginning. He set that reporter girl he met in college on fire with the death note because he had no use left for her. He could have saved her, she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, but he really just didn‚Äôt care. At all. That alone shows such a shift in he mental wiring. He wouldn‚Äôt have done such a thing at the beginning. If Light had stuck to killing criminals, I think an argument could be made for him to win. But he didn‚Äôt. And honestly, even if he reduced crime and war by 70 percent, he only accomplished that through tyranny. What kind of life is worth living with someone breathing down your neck just for not being hard working, or kind, or honest? Who is Light to tell people whether they‚Äôre working hard or not, or whether they‚Äôre kind and honest? It‚Äôs completely subjective to Light‚Äôs increasingly insane interpretation of what is good and what isn‚Äôt. In the end, he didn‚Äôt care about justice, he just wanted to be the unopposed god he thought himself to be. So, no. Going by his post time skip self, he definitely didn‚Äôt deserve to win.

As for my own unpopular opinion, there were times where I honestly didn‚Äôt mind Misa. But these moments were mostly in the Yotsuba arc where she had no memories and was more helpful than usual.",1559347265

I haven't seen much of MJF's ring work, but I'd *highly* suggest seeing some of his promo/character work on YouTube's ""Being the Elite"".  The guy has main event level heel written all over him, and he's only twenty-three years old and only has four years of wrestling experience.

"MurderedByWords","t5_3hx3r","See, there you go, showing that ignorance we were discussing.

Firstly, as soon as you start restricting the ways that people are allowed to legally defend themselves, you've stripped some of their right to self-defense and bodily autonomy. This isn't even getting into the fact that self-defense includes ""against agents of the state."" There is an elderly man in New York state who was just recently arrested and charged with a felony, not because he killed two home invaders, but because he owned his handgun ""illegally."" He's looking at having other rights stripped from him because his method of self-defense wasn't state-sanctioned. Cases like his occur daily.

As for your desire to restrict ""assault weapons,"" define your terms. Slapping ""assault"" in front of whatever tool someone is trying to ban is a scare tactic, relying on intentionally vacuous, ill-defined, and meaningless terminology that was selected solely for the emotional response it causes. ""Assualt weapons,"" when its common usage is applied to define it, just means a cosmeticly different version, with no change in operation or functionality. It's simply a politically-charged way of saying ""gun that I find scary, probably because it's black."" If you think that you have a better definition, I'd love to discuss it with you.

So, why should your fears about how something looks be more important than someone else's fundamental rights?",1559347266

And the ""2* Only"" Vs. Revue will come eventually - it'll be a completely different world when people can have fully broken 2-Star Memoirs to use without putting any effort into obtaining them.  I've gone from only TWO 2-Star Memoirs to twenty-seven in less than a day.

The Musician's Guide to Theory and Analysis by Clendinning and Marvin is an American music course.

We have a different approach to music teaching in the UK. For example the retaining of the words ""crotchet"", ""minim"", ""semibreve"", etc, for note names. This is because the UK approach to music is based upon the premise that eventually the student will study Renaissance music with breves. I use fractional note names when messing around but as soon as I get serious I revert to the UK naming system.

"minnesotaunited","t5_2wjn5","I think Romario not working out was a huge blow to both Darwin and our offense. DQ likes guys who can make runs at goal. Diagonal runs seem to be his preference, but he has the touch and skill to lob the ball to a vertical run also. Romario was easily our best player at making diagonal runs. Plus he had a good first touch and kept control of the ball, unlike Abu. Miguel is decent at it but prefers to play on the currently overloaded right side. Runs at goal just isn‚Äôt either Finlay or Angelos game. Maybe Molino will be adept at it. Or, at least possess the ball enough in the final 3rd to draw defenders and give DQ some space. CR was good because DQ could lob him the ball and Ramirez was always looking to go toward goal. It opened up space and led to some great chances after a nice Darwin pass. Maybe Toye could learn to play that way more? Though his first touch has been almost as suspect as Abu‚Äôs. I really think we need a striker and a left wing next window. I would add those 2 before I would worry about LB. Miller and Dotson should largely be able to handle it. Right now our offense is lost and must be fixed.",1559347268

I also lost around a hundred pounds and wanted to fast down to the 130s. I was so afraid of getting fat again that I put off bulking.

DO NOT DO THIS

I cannot put into words how much I regret trying to do this. You NEED to gain muscle mass. 

You've lost enough weight. Start a lean bulk (.5lbs/week). If you want to maintain the benefits of fasting (I do this), start 16:8 or 20:4 IF. 

I was so afraid of getting fat again that I put off bulking for so long. If you start bulking now, and I mean an extend bulk, around 6 months to a year, it will be so much easier to cut. Your increased BMR will help you lose fat faster. And then you will be able to cut to a (more) ripped body.

I know it's hard. It took me so long to start bulking because of the fear. It is just something you have to accept. You may gain some fat, but if you eat enough protein,  the muscle mass you gain will MORE than make up for it.",1559347268

"wow","t5_2qio8","I like it...FOR SOME SPECS.

Tidesages, Lithforge Draenei SP, Moonpriests are cool, it doesn't affect the class fantasy that much and tie some lose ends.

But Spellbreakers, Necromancers and even Dark Rangers.have a LOT more going on to them and the video just butchers those aspects so that they can fit in the specs.

Spellbreakers have more going on to them, they are magic anulators, capable of neutralizing and resiting beyond the normal Silenc from a Prot paladin and the way Taliesin just makes  Control Magic into the passive really is baffling, since the original spell was about controlling others summoned creatures.

This is a whole class fantasy that is tossed away to fit the Prot paladin playstyle.

&amp;#x200B;

Dark Rangers 

""They are High elf Undead hunters and rogues""

Forgets that Nathanos is a thing.

But besides that,  what about the life stealing aspect, the banshee scream, the mind controlling  of a Wc3 Dark Ranger?

&amp;#x200B;

And Necromancer is by far the worst example, are we supposed to ignore:

* Bwonsamdi
* The Death side of the Drust
* The new Lightforge Undead that can yet be explored and expanded
* Helya
* The Shadowmoon Clan
* The Lich form of Kel'thuzad and other scourges members

Just so we can have a ""Necromancer"", the point of a necromancer is not to be a Dk 2.0 or a Warlock 2.0, is to explored the many death aspects that Wow keeps adding each and every expansion, that Dks can't pick up because they are bound to be Scourge warriors.

By that same logic, the Tinker he advertised so much on the other video can be a BM Hunter, change the shots to be lasers, rockets and Kill command to have a Lock-ON spell effect.",1559347269

In 1961 the AL awarded an expansion team to Washington after the original Senators moved to Minnesota. On April 10, they hosted their first game (against the White Sox). Coot Veal got the first hit for the new franchise. What member of the original Senators gave up that hit?

Day 32.  The Spring is coming to an end.  I pray the planting has been well and I may return to see it's harvest.

The Knight Holzhauer vanquished his foes again, but I saw a weakening in his armor.  The Clue Goddess divined it and he was taken aback.  ""It's a tough category"" he said!  His bet was meager for a Knight of his stature and I thought he was surely bested.  It was not so.

Even the hardest strokes sometimes stray.

His opponents were fighting to their last.  The Maiden-Knight Megan and the Lord Rob.  Their battle to be the one who last fell was exhilarating.  We must find joy in the small battles in this unending war.

All wars end though.  Only the Gods know when this one will.

Forever,

&gt; &amp;quot;Mexico and China compete. When Mexico wins, China loses. When China wins, Mexico loses,&amp;quot; Guajardo said on &amp;quot;The Exchange.""

&gt; Trump said he was imposing the tariffs to stop illegal immigrants from coming through Mexico into the U.S. The announcement came just as the approval process for the new trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada started to get underway.

&gt; China has reportedly halted U.S. soy purchases and threatened to cut off its rare earth minerals supply to the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S. has blacklisted Chinese telecom giant Huawei, making it nearly impossible for the company to service customers.

Know that if you go undecided, you'll be unable to take any ITEC courses - they're extraordinary strict about keeping seats restricted to majors only. I'm not sure if the EECS department is as strict, so contact them before settling for undecided. If they are as strict, go ITEC first year, and take ITEC 1620 and MATH 1190 in fall, then ITEC2610 (Object-Oriented Programming), and another MATH department course in winter. Ensures you keep up with code for the year that you aren't CS. Fill the remainder with Gen Eds that are required for CS. 

Remember to maintain a GPA of at least 5.0, with the MATH (where the second digit isn't 5) requiring a minimum 5.0 average as well. If you don't meet these, you'll 100% be denied the program change.",1559347274

&gt; Trump said he was imposing the tariffs to stop illegal immigrants from coming through Mexico into the U.S. The announcement came just as the approval process for the new trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada started to get underway.

&gt; China has reportedly halted U.S. soy purchases and threatened to cut off its rare earth minerals supply to the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S. has blacklisted Chinese telecom giant Huawei, making it nearly impossible for the company to service customers.

FFPS was a trap, it wasn't meant to be a fully fledged restaurant, that's why they didn't care what bad things happened and the full company might've not even been there, the only people we know that work are Henry, Michael, and someone who uses the animatronic parts",1559347277

"DnDHomebrew","t5_2xzpc","Okay, some parts seem really cool, so I'll go through my thoughts on each

**The Strongest Rage** \- cool concept, barbarian wielding massive weapons in one hand. Strength to AC is cool, has the potential to get a bit over the top once you hit level cap but that's true of anything really.

**Limitless Strength** \- poorly worded. I assume that means you can use your strength ability modifier for the check, replacing the original ability? Which would mean you can substitute strength for mental abilities too?  Doesn't make a lot of sense. Likewise for strength to stealth or sleight of hand. If you want to keep that I'd personally suggest making it recharge on a long rest instead cause as-is it's a little too good at turning a barbarian that's all about being Mr Muscles into a skill-monkey.

**Staggering Strength** \- cool. Probably change the wording on the direction to 'directly away from you'. Also DC 10+mod+prof is maybe a bit too much, as the DCs for pretty much everything else in the game are calculated at 8+mod+prof. Since you're getting this twice a turn, you probably don't need that extra boost.

**The Strongest** \- ...kind of lackluster actually. carrying capacity increase is cool, but a lot of people ignore it anyways. Since a few races get that as a default ability you should probably get it earlier on in the subclass, at 3rd or 6th level. The bonus damage probably isn't too powerful, though having to ask each time you hit a new creature ""what's its strength score"" is a bit clunky. probably just give a straight bonus to damage and maybe some other sort of buff.

Also, there's flavor text at the beginning talking about a favourite weapon, but nothing mechanically backs that up?",1559347277

Japan is also one of the biggest markets for Kpop groups, which obviously comes from a country they always had conflitct with.

You can do exactly the same with both, Vue is a bit smaller and probably a bit faster, but I feel Vue removes a lot of boilerplate because it adds a bit of magic. Generally I don't like magic in programming, but once you understand what Vue does it helps you write code faster than React.

React is very idealistic. Instead of accepting the simple truth that the web is made of HTML, CSS, and JS (and will be for many years) it tries to bring everything into the terrain of a pure JS idealistic mentality. Is this right? Is this wrong? Eh, that is pretty subjective thing.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is wading into the United Kingdom's political maelstrom days before he is set to embark on his first state visit there, saying Boris Johnson would be an ""excellent"" prime minister and calling Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, ""nasty.""

In an interview with the British tabloid The Sun, Trump expressed support for the controversial ex-foreign secretary in his bid to replace Theresa May, saying, ""I think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent.""

May is to step down amid an impasse over Brexit on June 7, just days after Trump is set to be feted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and after official observances of the 75th anniversary of D-Day are concluded.

Trump referred to the American-born Duchess of Sussex as ""nasty"" over comments she made in 2016 threatening to move to Canada if Trump won the White House.

""I didn't know that she was nasty,"" he said of Meghan when read her prior criticism. The former Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, in 2018 and gave birth to their first child, Archie, in May.

During the state visit, the president, his wife, Melania, and his four adult children are expected to meet with Harry as well as his brother, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, and his wife, Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge. Meghan is expected to stay home with Archie.

Trump told the newspaper that he didn't know that he wouldn't be meeting Markle but predicted that she will make ""a very good"" American princess.

As for May, Trump criticized her handling of Brexit negotiations with the European Union, saying she ""didn't give the European Union anything to lose.""

Trump's first visit to the UK as president was marred by similar critical comments he made to the same tabloid last year about May's handling of Brexit.

Trump is scheduled to arrive in London on Monday for a three-day visit.",1559347280

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","Hi, relatively new player here and could use some general guidance.

I went with a merfolk deck as my first, since i liked that jungle secret starter deck, following [this guide](https://youtu.be/LCsDaZFxG4M?t=397) (timestamped where the list is shown; only missing a few cards to complete, some more dual lands and parts of the side deck). In Ranked it actually did decently well (got to platinum, haven't tried getting higher), but in Constructed event (which i played a lot) the results were pretty mixed, especially since facing that mono red damage deck is basically an instant loss. At least managed one 7 win run though.

* Is there any better list (maybe another type of merfolk deck) that shares a lot of cards with my current one?

* From packs/constructed event i got a lot of random cards, is there any way to see if i i already got a lot of cards towards another popular deck? Because after spending most of the crafting resources on the merfolk deck i can't really start anything new from scratch

* I bought the $5 starter pack since this seemed like a good deal (otherwise want to stay f2p). Am i right in assuming that playing ""Ranked Draft Dorminaria"" would be the best way to spend them or do i just buy packs? Also is there any good guide or site/program that can help me decide which cards are a good choice? Since i probably won't be able to afford those often i'd need to make it count

* I also got 10k gold, should what's the most effective way to spend that besides playing Constructed. Is it also worth doing Dorminaria for 5k gold? Or should i buy packs for 1k (doesn't seem as effective)?",1559347280

I mean hes straight up murdering people and quipping about how something bleeding and shit plus Ben looked totally out of it when playing Bruce Wayne. I know there are a LOT of Snyder fans out of there (why? I still dont know) but Snyder ruined the DCEU  and Batman with his own ""superior vision"". Ya'll people still dont understand that the ONLY reason Ben Affleck was cast as Batman was because hes an oscar winning popular actor, whenever people hear the name Ben Affleck they wanna go see what hes doing regardless of what age they are. Radical castings like Robert Pattinson as Batman are evidence that the director is looking for more than just a public image and money making name, hes looking for talent and a name that you dont expect to be linked to a superhero. Although, I still think Twilight is one of the WORST film series in history, I still have confidence in Pattinson, I saw a film he did ""Good Times"" (go check it out) and it was great. His performance was AMAZING tbh I was blown away so I have full faith in Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson and I hope they deliver the DEFINITIVE Batman that we all deserve.",1559347282

&gt; China has reportedly halted U.S. soy purchases and threatened to cut off its rare earth minerals supply to the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S. has blacklisted Chinese telecom giant Huawei, making it nearly impossible for the company to service customers.

I suppose if you've been asleep for the past six months.

&gt;All I can tell is that's a lot of people entering Mexico, and it'd be interesting to see how that crowd compares with the one that reaches our border, because that would tell you more accurately how much they're contributing.

You are lying about being interested.  If you were interested, you would have spent the few seconds it takes to find many, many sources detailing the size of the initial caravan, and the size and timing of it's arrival at our border.  About half the original number arrived in one clump, and the rest blended in with the general northern flow and are difficult to count other than the general increase in the massing at the border and increased daily attempts at crossing.

&gt;Keep in mind that Mexico can't close its border to asylum seekers any more than we can, but they can process them downstream.

International norms dictate that asylum should be sought in the first safe country.  Asylum claims in the U.S. are greatly weakened if they are not stopping in Mexico.  Unless you don't consider Mexico safe, in which case we should definitely secure our border with them.",1559347283

1) The way you treat your veterans. For real. You act like they personally saved you and all of your families lives. Dafuq? Like I agree that we should do that over here, but what the actual fuck?

2) WHAT THE FUCK IS THE 35 YEARS BULLSHIT. For anyone thats not a yank, They have to ID you if you look under 35. And they wouldn't take british ID. Guess my old man couldn't get his drink after all.

3) AND WHILE I'M ON THE FUCKING TOPIC. 21 TO DRINK!? FUCK OFF! Seriously, What the hell is going on there!?

4) How stupidly big everything is. For approximately 200k Pound sterling (Probably about 300k USD) They managed to get a house that would EASILY cost 2 Million Pounds or more over here. Explain that one to me.

5) Why the do people take ""You alright?"" as some kind of insult? Seriously, this one still confuses me to this day, I just don't get it.

6) Nascar. Idk if I love it or hate it. Like, Its just watching some guys go around a track 400 million times. Buuuuuut the amount of collisions that happen, Thats cool. So yeah, Mixed feelings on that.

7) Walmart. Just Walmart in general. Why the fuck can I buy a sandwich and a shotgun from the same place. Like, we have Asda, the british brand of walmart, but they don't even scrape the surface of what you lot have.

That's really interesting you say that because they specifically mention AV as part of my role - I've maintained a few projectors in my role, but really that amounts to turning off the bulb age notification more than anything :P

When I had my interview for the network role I specifically asked if the culture was similar to a service desk / MSP, wherein you spend all day doing high volume, low complexity calls/tickets. He understood my point and noted that the environment is much slower paced as they work on complex networking problems and they focus on quality of delivery than the volume of calls.  He also mentioned that because they have a ""slower"" environment, it meant that they can spend a good portion of their time training staff on bespoke systems as well as common ones. 

Certainly more challenging, but perhaps more satisfying? I'm not sure !

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Not *all* our logic is redundant outside the universe. Somethings will *always* be true, irrespective of what kind of logic is ""outside"" the universe. Tautologies for example will always be true, regardless of whether they are inside or outside our universe.  For example, a cat also exists outside the universe, or does not also exist outside the universe.  That to me seems to be always true. Indeed, other concepts like a married bachelor can never exist, regardless of what universe/laws of logic you take because human defined mutually exclusive concepts are mutually exclusive in all worlds because we made them expressly to be mutually exclusive.  I don't see how either of those concepts could possibly be false irrespective of logic outside our universe so clearly it seems to me that some of our logic does apply.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally this whole post seems to utterly degrade human logic to a self-refuting point necessarily, the majority of this post raises an objection that we can't apply our logic to ""prior"" the universe, and yet you spend half the post explaining how faulty our logic within the universe is and how prone to error it can be which seems to be a self-created red herring given arguing against logic within our universe, is self-refuting, but you are only dealing with logic outside our universe and whether it applies.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I don't see any reason as to why we should *work off the assumption* that our logic does not apply outside the universe. Scientists work off the assumption of the PSR which is not demonstrated true, and indeed could quite possibly be false, but if scientists instead worked off the assumption that the PSR is *false* then I really don't see how we can ever progress. Indeed it seems to me that if anything wasn't 100% certain one can always argue that it is on the person with the burden of proof to 100% demonstrate things and if they fall short, even by a slimmer of % (even if that was measurable) there is still that certain things ""don't necessarily apply beyond a certain point"".

&amp;#x200B;

So all in all, I find aspects of your post self-refuting, although I can sympathies with your claim when you keep it strictly to human logic outside the universe and not within, but I also find your position to be untenable when it comes to trying to move forward and answer the hard questions as a species. Additionally, let's say you were actually wrong and our logic does apply, just because we don't know that for sure now, there is no reason why we can't move forward on that assumption and deal with issue that would inevitably come up if our logic *was* proven to apply. Essentially, sometimes you have to work off of things that are given in debates to actually explore topics further. E.G in debates about God's nature, and whether God is good or evil, one has to answer the question first based on the assumption that a God exists and then find whether that assumption works with the conclusion, but throughout all the premises you still have to assume it exists, because the question isn't whether God exists, but whether God is evil or not. Similarly here, debating the cosmological arguments is relevant even if we can't guarantee the axiom that our logic necessarily applies beforehand.",1559347285

Mr. Mueller stated that the report did not clear the President and that ""[w]hen a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators it strikes at the core of the government‚Äôs effort to find the truth and hold wrong doers accountable."" Mueller explained that the DoJ couldn't charge a sitting President and that the Constitution requires a ""process other than the criminal justice system"" to take disciplinary action against a sitting president. Congress has the Constitutional mandate to investigate high crimes and misdemeanors committed by the President and can take disciplinary action through impeachment proceedings. He stated that the American people must recognize that the report determined systematic election interference conducted by the Russian government. He reiterated on numerous occasions that the Office's written work speaks for itself. There are multiple instances of obstruction in the report.

Here's a quick summary of a few key findings in the Mueller report;



        Mueller‚Äôs investigation exposed a ""sweeping and systematic"" operation by the Russian government to interfere in the election, including making multiple contacts with officials associated with Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign. Barr released a redacted version of the report on April 18. Although the investigation didn‚Äôt establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government, Mueller ""identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign,"" according to his report.

        ‚ÄúThe investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,"" the report said.

        Mueller also chronicled at least 10 instances in which Trump acted to obstruct the investigation, only to be stymied in some efforts by the refusal of his aides to carry out his orders.

        ‚ÄúIf we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,‚Äù according to the report. ‚ÄúBased on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.‚Äù

 EARLY JAN. 2016: Carter Page meets with Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski about joining the Trump campaign, and he then becomes a ‚Äúlow-level junior‚Äù volunteer with an informal foreign policy committee tied to the campaign.



You are a brainwashed buffoon if you think this report (that I'm sure you THOUGHT would implicate Clinton, because you believe the propaganda you've been force fed, but suddenly it doesn't say anything of the sort, so now you have to attack the report itself, and Mueller, since it doesn't say what you want to hear anymore) was in any way started illegally.  

Here's the actual timeline, set in motion by a braggadocios diatribe in a bar by one drunken Carter Page, a Trump advisor:

 EARLY 2013: Carter Page, who years later would become an unpaid adviser to Trump‚Äôs campaign, shares information and research with a Russian national whom the FBI later accuses of being a Kremlin spy. According to the FBI, the spy is secretly recorded in April 2013 talking with another accused spy about efforts to ‚Äúrecruit‚Äù Page ‚Äúas an intelligence source.‚Äù (Page cooperated with the investigation. He has since said his communications were innocent and has denied relaying any sensitive or private information to the accused spy.)

JUNE 2015: Donald Trump announces his candidacy for president.

SEPTEMBER 2015: Looking to boost one of the other Republicans running for the GOP nomination, the right-leaning Washington Free Beacon retains the Washington-based firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump.

DECEMBER 2015: Michael Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, attends a gala in Moscow celebrating the Kremlin-backed television network RT, which paid Flynn more than $45,000 to attend. Flynn, who does not join the Trump campaign as an adviser for another few months, is captured on camera sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

JANUARY 2016: Former British spy Christopher Steele sends a ""happy new year"" message to someone he‚Äôs known for some time, Bruce Ohr, the head of the Justice Department‚Äôs Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Steele also mentions their mutual interest in a Russian oligarch they previously followed together and who may be visiting the United States soon. In his position at the Justice Department, Ohr not only coordinates the department's efforts to crack down on drug trafficking and foreign cartels, but he also serves as a top official inside the deputy attorney general‚Äôs office.

FEB. 2016: Steele and Ohr remain in contact, without Ohr‚Äôs bosses at the Justice Department knowing. They continue to discuss the Russian oligarch's visit to the United States. Meanwhile, Steele has been working for the FBI as a confidential informant, and the FBI advises him of his obligations as an informant, including his responsibility to keep his relationship with the FBI secret. He is working on undisclosed matters. (In documents since publicly released, the FBI says information previously provided by Steele, and unrelated to Trump or Russian election meddling, had been corroborated and used to prosecute cases. But the documents do not offer any more details about what was corroborated or used.)

EARLY MARCH 2016: George Papadopoulos becomes a foreign policy adviser to Trump‚Äôs campaign.

MARCH 14, 2016: While traveling in Italy, Papadopoulos meets a London-based professor who claims to have connections with the Russian government.

AROUND MARCH 24, 2016: While in London, Papadopoulos sends an email to Carter Page and other campaign members, telling them the professor he met in Italy two weeks earlier has introduced him to the Russian ambassador to England and a Russian woman who is supposedly Putin‚Äôs niece. Papadopoulos says in the email that the two Russians might be able to help set up a meeting between Trump and Putin. (Page later tells congressional investigators he remembers that the email from Papadopoulos mentioned the professor had introduced Papadopoulos to Russian government officials.)

MARCH 2016: The FBI interviews Carter Page about his contacts in Russia.

MARCH 2016: Russian hackers launch an operation to break into computer systems associated with the DNC and email accounts of Clinton campaign staff, including campaign chairman John Podesta.

An ear syringe labelled as 'safe' and gentle was all it took, bought by my mother. All I needed was a few cautions, people mentioning risks of permanent hearing loss no matter how small, my mum to just leave me be and wait for appointment... and I wouldn't be waking up every day wishing I was dead, devoid of joy I once had just a few months ago.

I don't know whether to blame myself for using it ever so slightly wrong despite no warnings or any feasible risk, or blame all the factors that led up to me making such an easy mistake or even using it in the first place. Either way, none of it deserves to make me suffer with constant volume for eternity. This may change if I reach some kind of acceptance, but right now its cure in next decade or death for me

Buckets are extremely easy to work with, and with a pack of q-tips and a bit of common sense you will be able to use it to get a clean hit every time with minimal effort. That's why a bucket atomizer is in the sidebar: they're simple, efficient, and have room for customization and expansion.

The biggest problem of all is that he allowed things to get to a point where he's thinking about breaking up, and he didn't raise these issues beforehand or let you know he's not happy. Basically, if you're this surprised, then I can only assume he has been hiding his true feelings for a while. 

So, the only thing you can really do is talk things over, but be aware that his lack of communication would need to be addressed if the relationship has any chance moving forward. You can't help what you don't know about. Anyway, I hope things work out for you. Maybe the relationship is over, but sometimes that's for the best.",1559347293

It worked the majority of the time and even thought he'd still pop into my thoughts I had SOME way of controlling it.

I really hope you break contact with him, block his number and social media if need be. Begging someone for their affection should never be part of a relationship, and you deserve so much better than this.

During the transitional stage, especially the moments just after the revolution, reactionaries would be suppressed, as this is the goal of the socialist state, the dictatorship of the proletariat.

How they will be suppressed is up to the people to decide in a centralist-democractic framework. Be the people themselves, be their deputies.

So, the method can be anywhere to let them free, to reeducate them, to execute them... It's up to the people.

If you take a look at the China's last Emperor history, you will be surprised, actually.

The communism will be achieved once the material conditions allow it and the socialist state get rid of all elements that threatens or impedes this goal, it's deeper than just persecution of reactionaries, but a whole mentality to be developed within society.

So, as a communist, the only answer I can provide to you is that the reactionaries will be repressed in one way or another, the methods, however, will depend on the people's choice.",1559347295

Sony can do much more with 50 billion dollars on their tech side than their entertainment side.

Even if they leverage it into a streaming product, they are going to be dwarfed by Disney, Warner, and Universal who have large scale plans ready to go. CBS All Access will be overrun by all three relatively quickly.

I think Vivendi will be a big player. Selling off a large chunk of Universal Music will give them a large amount of capital to invest and they need more reliable traditional media.",1559347298

"cancer","t5_2qixx","Ok so after many hours waiting for my oncologist to squeeze me in, lots of anxiety and tears, he showed me the results of the new X-rays and they look fantastic, nothing like they did three weeks ago. The stent was completely occluded, clogged and was serving no purpose other than making it really difficult to breathe. The tumor while still visible is nothing like it was, the stent was basically just rattling around until that last coughing fit when it shot out. I honestly thought it was a piece of pasta when it happened. I guess the stent has mesh that helps hold it in place between the tumor and the trachea and because of the significant shrinkage, it dislodged with the last coughing fit. The doctor who put in the stent has still not contacted me, but my oncologist sits on the board there and he was NOT happy at the way this was handled. I get that things like this could happen but to flat out refuse to order an X-ray and to return a damned call is pretty messed up. All the therapists in my radiation team were thrilled because they knew earlier this week how much the tumor had shrunk but it wasn‚Äôt their place to say anything, until today after I brought up my meeting with the oncologist and the wayward stent. They all had smiles before I‚Äôd really said anything so they knew what was up. They did say they‚Äôd never seen anyone cough one up though so that was a first for all of us. They were so happy for me I thought we‚Äôd all be blubbering messes before I even made it into the radiation room. After all that fear, just a lot of relief and good news. I feel so fortunate!

&gt;&gt;do you now admit that her crimes and the subsequent investigation happened during the Obama Administration and predate Trump?

this is not a whataboutism you clearly don't know what that word means.

&gt;&gt;Do you know admit that her crimes are not directly linked to International sanctions against Iran and are related to her Misrepresentation of a financial relationship between her company and it one of its subsidiaries?

&gt;Useless whataboutism.

This is not a whataboutism you clearly don't know what that word means.


&gt;&gt;do you admit that at the time the crimes were committed there were International sanctions against Iran not just American sanctions?

&gt;Useless whataboutism.

This is not a whataboutism you clearly don't know what that word means



&gt;&gt; do you now admit that her crimes and the subsequent investigation happened during the Obama Administration and predate Trump?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**First of all, not crimes, the allegations occured during Obama era, i never once denied this.**

so then we can agree this is not some made-up conspiracy theory that was concocted by the Trump Administration and all of this was in the works well before anyone knew Trump could even possibly be elected or that there was going to be a trade war.


&gt;&gt;Do you now admit that her crimes are not directly linked to International sanctions against Iran and are related to her Misrepresentation of a financial relationship between her company and it one of its subsidiaries

&gt;The allegations include the nature of different corporate entities. 

It's bank fraud. she lied about having a financial relationship between the parent company huawei and a Chinese subsidiary called skycom. she is alleged to have done this in order to secure financing that she would otherwise not have been able to secure.



&gt;It also includes allegations of sanction circumvention. I don't know why you are denying this.

No it is bank fraud. she knew she would not be able to obtain financing because one of the subsidiaries was doing business with Iran but that is not a core element of the case. The Iran sanctions are red herrings.


&gt;&gt;do you now admit that at the time the crimes were committed there were International sanctions against Iran not just American sanctions?

&gt;The sanctions were entirely united states led as they have been for most of recent history.

This is disingenuous and false. there were International sanctions in place you can complain that the United States had a role in crafting those sanctions but there were International sanctions in place just admit it.



&gt;So besides the fact you sound like a little fascist

Nice classless personal attack.


 
&gt;Meanwhile your definition of answering my questions?

&gt;&gt;1) Do you believe there is no double standard in how United States executives are treated versus Meng?

I already answered this useless whataboutism in another post. if you refuse to ignore the thousands of people who are prosecuted every year in the United States for bank fraud that is your business but this is a whataboutism. pay close attention and you may actually learn what that word means.


&gt;&gt;2) Do you believe that there are no double standard as to how the USA operates within the WTO?

again another useless whataboutism that has absolutely nothing to do with this case and I answered this question in a previous post.

Any attempts to skirt the rule &amp; this ruling in any titles, comments or the image its self will result in further punishment.

It may seem excessive but if you knew the amount of creeps/pedophiles we take care of on a daily to weekly basis you would understand why we are so strict and don't allow anything but the most PG pictures on the subreddit to not give creeps anything to save or latch onto or anything of the like, plus we are dealing with an underage subreddit here it's honestly pretty common sense.

We used to allow it under very specific restrictions and other requirements but users kept pushing the line to try to get more and more and forced our hand to do a completely strict blanket ban.

You are totally free to post a different picture of course, as long as it too follows the rules.

The company I was at in 2012 used space in a high-rise in Manhattan as one of our primary datacenters.  As hurricane Sandy approached, we had a chat with the datacenter ops people, and they assured us that power would remain on, even if municipal power failed, that they had fuel on site to run their generators for over a week.

Even with that, we evacuated all traffic from that datacenter, of course.

Well, the 1st floor of that building flooded, municipal power failed, and the generators came on, great.  A few hours later, we got a call from them saying that power would fail within the hour.  Why?  Well, their generators were going to run out of fuel.  What about the reserve on-site fuel?  Yeah, they had that, but the fuel ports on the generators were under water, and they could not be reached.  We lol'd and suggested that they get some scuba gear next time.",1559347301

"Truckers","t5_2t90b","I was about to wet my pants at the thought of backing up when I took my test.  It took a few months for me to actually get to where I thought I could consistently get into a spot without screwing up.

Don't worry about having to pull up.  If you need to do it 50 times, do it 50 times.  Turn your cb off before you pull into the truck stop.  Never be afraid to ask someone for advice.  If you're at a place and it's a live load/unload, watch other trucks.  See how they set up and what they do.  You can pick up a lot of tips that way.

I drove OTR for 11 years and was a driver trainer for my company.  I still drive part-time and right now I'm working part-time as a yard jockey.  I back up hundreds of times every week and there are still times I just stop and wonder how I ever got my cdl.

If you're at a truck stop early and there are plenty of spaces, don't be afraid to practice backing a few times.  

I don't know how it is at other locations, but if you're at our warehouse and get one of the three dock doors where you have to blindside in, ask one of us and we'll either help you get into the spot, or you can drop your trailer and we'll back it in for you.",1559347302

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Girls don't get to talk about this stuff. Seriously. 

You know who taught me about what sex should feel like for a woman? A girl in my class who was sleeping with a 30 year old man. We were sixteen. 

You know where I learned I was allowed to say no, even if I'd said yes before? The fucking internet. When I was in my 20's. Plenty of damage was done before then. 

The fact that your daughter can have this conversation with your wife is fucking major. Like, major major. It's super amazing that she feels comfortable talking to her mom about this stuff. Your wife is straight up killing it. 

I know you feel left out, but what would you have done with that information except worry and get weird? Would you have had a conversation with your daughter about safe sex, consent, and pleasure? If the answer is any form of no, even ""I don't think she'd want to talk to me about it,"" you need to leave this alone. 

Your daughter's need for this information from a reliable source who is looking out for your daughter's best interests outweighs your... Whatever it is that's making you feel weird. Trust your wife to handle this one and be glad you married and had kids with an incredible mom.",1559347302

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I once read an academic piece that basically said that gay chicken and male faux gayness is a way for dudes to express intimacy in a controlled way. You aren't *really* feminine for cuddling your friend, you're just joking. Same with grabbing their chest, or kissing them on a dare. 

On the one hand, as a straight guy who's done that kind of shit with his friends, I think it's an outlet that not a lot of 20 something guys with or without girlfriends have. Girls are kind of trained by society to be the ones who are emotionally intelligent, while guys have a culture that reinforces either unattachment or expressions of anger/power. At the same time, thinking about it critically kind of makes it feel like I and others are feeding into the stereotype? Like, I can only show connection by pretending I'm a stereotype of a sexuality I'm not?

Then again, sexuality is hard to pin down sometimes. I think (we only had to read a section of the paper for class) the paper went on to describe gay chicken as a way for bi-curious dudes to experiment without getting labeled as 'gay,' or to express real feelings of romance that they might have.",1559347304

EGC start when the hatch is closed. unless you have a key, forget about it.  


Doors are close each others.... I wont mind about it

When EGC was announced, they said that we will have 3 minute to escape.... I thought it was fair, but they reduce it to 2 min and now it's impossible, because you have to open a door in 30 seconds. if the killer come, it's over, even if you mind him, you cant escape. And if you manage to avoid him, if he notice you tried to open the door (wit hthe red dot), he gonna camp. So you cant escape since you have to go to the other door and open it. Since the killer will check this other door, you have to change door again and the Entity will catch you before you escape.

&gt;A prominent ‚Äúconversion therapy‚Äù advocate, David Matheson, has come out as gay after spending what he said were decades of his life entrenched in homophobia.

&gt;Matheson was a practitioner of the practice also known as ‚Äúex-gay therapy‚Äù or reparative therapy‚Äù, which promotes the false idea that being gay is something that should, and can, be ‚Äúcured‚Äù. **These therapies have been denounced by major medical bodies including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the UK‚Äôs National Health Service.**

So for starters, most of the Vagrants were not alive to experience the Cataclysm. They are the descendants of the descendants of the descendants of those who originally survived, though some ancient Vagrants still speak of the horrors they witnessed in the time before the great fire. 

It's not a literal repetition of what happened in the previous age, but it is thematically similar. I'm workshopping the overall story of the world, but most of the problems present in the world are a result of unchecked ambition, and some level of desperation. 

Think of it kind of like how the (spoilers for bioshock) ending of bioshock infinite is. Theres always a man. Theres always a lighthouse, and theres always some unchecked evil orchestrating the events of the plot.

It's very much like that in this world. Withholding the risk of me rambling on and on, heres a basic rundown: there's always the desert, theres always a knight, and theres always the Cataclysm, and those behind it. 

The Cataclysm was not the first apocalypse this world has endured. It is the only one remembered.

Where did you even get this from? [The ratcheting screwdriver was invented as early as the 1800s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_screwdriver)...maybe you're thinking about the [impactless wrench and rotary hammer drill](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/ipp/home/myth_tools.html) which were contracted by NASA but invented by Black and Decker? I doubt that Black and Decker didn't get paid for their work.

&gt;supposedly there is a LOT of space junk up there - presumably some of it from screws and bolts that they ""lost"" while constructing things (like the ISS).

Space junk is a problem, but if it's lost from the ISS it's not a huge deal since there is no relative speed, and orbits decay relatively quickly at that altitude due to the very thin but present atmosphere. [In 2008 astronauts lost a tool bag](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/tool-kit-dropped-from-space-station-2009-08-03/?redirect=1), and it re-entered about 8 months later.

&gt;You'd probably have to drop quite a few of those screws and bolts before you would hit anyone on the ground. The kids still throw pennies to this day, and virtually no-one gets hit (and when they do, it is an, admittedly painful, annoyance).

We had tried a couple of times before, but I was so tense it hurt and the memories started flooding my mind and I cried.


When I finally was comfortable enough to try again, he made sure to keep eye contact the whole time and be very gentle until I reciprocated. Eye contact was a big part of it. It was a constant reminder that it wasn't my perp, it was my boyfriend that I love with all my heart.  Once I could get past that, it got raunchy. üòÇ



But for real, it took me forever to be comfortable enough to do it with coaxing and reassuring words. Don't feel bad that you're not always ""in the mood"", because it's not easy to bounce back from sexual assault. Mine happened almost 10 years ago and the PTSD is just rearing it's ugly head.

&amp;#x200B;

And here's the opinion of a retired Japanese detective (the police I was referring to). I'm cutting out less important bits, and rather just his dialogue. And I much prefer this to America's atrocious low regulation in comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In Japan, no civilian is allowed to have a gun. In order to prevent atrocious crimes using firearms, possession of small arms was banned in 1965, with strict penalties for violations of the law. As time has gone on the penalties have increased and every year we try to drive down the number of people owning guns. You have to bring your rifle in every year for inspection. You have to pass a drug test. You can‚Äôt have a criminal record. A doctor has to certify you‚Äôre mentally and physically healthy. You have to actually go to the firing range and show that you can use the weapon. If you have any sort of issue, we‚Äôre going to take away your firearms. Sometimes, police officers even go to the neighborhoods where a gun owner lives and interview neighbors to make sure the owner isn‚Äôt causing problems or having issues with his spouse. There are not many hunters left now and many people get too old to use their weapons. If they can‚Äôt fire them properly, they get taken away. The fewer guns that are out there, the safer Japan is. That‚Äôs how we look at it.  
&gt;  
&gt;A few years ago, an officer on duty used his gun to kill himself ‚Äî clearly non-designated usage, so that‚Äôs a crime. He was charged posthumously to publicly show that even the dead can‚Äôt get away with breaking the firearms laws, and to shame his family. It may seem like overkill but it drives home the point. You can‚Äôt easily hold up a convenience store or shoot someone to death if you don‚Äôt have a gun.

[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/01/06/national/media-national/even-gangsters-live-in-fear-of-japans-gun-laws/#.XPG8RYhKiM9](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/01/06/national/media-national/even-gangsters-live-in-fear-of-japans-gun-laws/#.XPG8RYhKiM9)

&amp;#x200B;

And hmm... violence against certain groups who are physically disadvantaged should be massive, when this isn't the case. Gun laws are so strict, even the Yakuza don't bother with them most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

The point of that court case was that police are not your personal bodyguards. Which makes sense. And maybe part of that reason is that they have to worry about being shot? People in America will shoot cops at traffic stops, but Americans don't really care about that as long as they get their death tools. The homicides could be at 100,000 a year and they still wouldn't and just shout ""my rights!"". There's no net positive from guns being there, just that some are defended. Guns are more likely to be used for intimidation purposes.",1559347308

Indian Army positions in the forward areas are on high alert and are keeping a strict vigil against any attempt by the Pakistanis to push terrorists into India.

"tuesday","t5_2r8s0","&gt;This argument implies then that we should not extend a right to anything if the resource is limited. 

No, its just an argument that its not a right. You can still do something about it, but its plainly not a right.

&gt;Again, I will draw a direct comparison to the right to legal counsel. It is an entirely limited resource, not a natural right, but it's value is so high that the essential right of a person's liberty cannot be fully exercised without it.

Not a right. Its probably more reasonable to call it a right than healthcare because its not limited in quite the same way-demand for healthcare is extremely inelastic where public defenders aren't something required all too often-but its not a right.

&gt;It's not about guaranteeing unlimited life, but ensuring that you have the ability to continue the life that you have without undue burden. 

If we extend this principle to its logical end its clearly nonsensical. There are so many undue burdens and they're all just factors of luck. Stupidity? Its an undue burden. Ugliness? Undue burden. Bad childhood? Undue burden. And all of that, along with basically all circumstances, are just pure luck. The case that you are making is essentially one for equality of all outcomes because almost all of life is pure chance if we're looking at it from an objective standpoint. The problem is that would be absolutely antithetical to the progression of the US, or even mankind in general.

This is ignoring the fact that really a single payer healthcare system actually has worse outcomes for treatable diseases when compared to the US. Britains NHS for example is an abomination. If we're talking about more middle of the road systems I would be much more open to it.

&gt;Well is it not interference when policy makers create rules that increase illnesses in citizens? Is it not interference when a corporation lies about the hazards of their product

&gt;Is it not an interference when companies that produce medications essential to your continued living (IE Epinephrine and Insulin) jack the price up so high that you can no longer afford it?

Now you're sort of straddling two different things here. Obviously some of your natural rights will be given up to the government in order to assure a better/more peaceful life. It has to be justifiable though.

But letting private entities act freely (set prices) is the opposite of interference as long as it does not interfere in another persons natural rights.

&gt;the right to access health care is about guaranteeing your ability to pursue liberty and be a productive citizen. It is utterly essential. Now whatever means we go about guaranteeing that access is one thing. I have no claim of preference of one system over the other. But what I do know is that what we do in the US doesn't work because for a supposedly market driven system, we spend the most money in the world for similar or in many cases worse health outcomes than nations that completely nationalize their health care systems.

I will agree the american system is not ideal (not that any system is, but it is in need of some reform) but there is also a lot of misinformation out there about the US system.

We spend more, but we really have the best, or very close to the best outcomes in the world when we look at treatable problems. Our cancer survival rates are among the best in basically every single type of cancer (https://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/practice-management/news/in-the-journals/%7Bf958e84b-6d0e-48cd-8f46-05911f4d31ec%7D/us-cancer-survival-rates-remain-among-highest-in-world) Note that this is in comparison to countries with ""universal coverage"" which certainly puts into question the value of that metric. We also have among the highest (maybe the highest? I can't find the study) life expediencies when you remove issues outside the direct influence of the medical field, that is gun violence, car crashes and drug use. Of course, all of that should be dealt with, but its not really an issue of the healthcare system being insufficient, but a cultural issue.

And really my main problem with this sort of line of reasoning is; why does it matter if we don't deal with this as some sort of privilege which the government doles out if that doesn't even lead to better outcomes?",1559347310

"WorldOfWarships","t5_2t8uj","Removing stealth AA was one of the biggest mistakes of the rework. Every other class relies on teammates to make up for deficiencies in their combat potential; BBs largely can't spot for themselves, Cruisers need teammates to either spot or draw aggression so that they can apply their DPM, and DDs generally lack DPM and as such require teammates to truly capitalize on their spotting.

CVs are so problematic in large part because of how much spotting they can do and this is because with the exception of a few AA specialized DDs, CVs have very few circumstances where they can accidentally stumble into a fatal encounter. Stealth AA cruisers played an important role in forcing CVs to rely on teammates for spotting because of how punishing stumbling into one could be; when they were removed we came to the current situation where CVs can spot the whole map at the start of each match, because there are very few ways to punish them for it.",1559347313

The rest of the servants have strong skill sets that make them worth using, but this isn't a thread where you should be openly bringing them up.

"windows","t5_2qh3k","1. Convertibles and touch screens became a thing. Microsoft tried to push tablets into the market back in 2002 but it failed because the hardware wasn't ready and because existing programs didn't work well with touch screens. Apple proved that the technology and the market were ready when it released the iPad and Microsoft proved that they could adapt when when they sold a ton of Surface devices. Windows is still changing, as you've noticed, and it will continue to change. But it's not just Microsoft. If you think that the Windows 10 GUI is dumbed down you should head over to the Linux side and try the Gnome desktop.

2. The world of IT moved towards automation and scriptability. Old versions of Windows server were designed to be operated with a mouse which is not optimal because servers are boxes that sit on a shelf in a closet somewhere. Old Windows systems expected you to manage them by clicking on control panel icons so the Command Prompt was a joke, the old terminal doubly so, and scripting was awkward. Nowadays Windows systems administration is PowerShell first. Windows server is headless first. Windows IT certifications expect you to know PowerShell. You can't say that Windows 7 was for savvy users because it had a control panel when Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and 2019 expects and empowers IT professionals to open a shell.

3. The cloud became a thing. If you're familiar with Office 365, Microsoft 365, and application and desktop streaming then you know what Windows and software as a service is. It's not about ""slowly chipping away at what made windows great"" or whatever that means.

4. Microsoft didn't start referring to programs and apps when Windows 8 came out. We've been calling programs [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) and [apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application) for over 40 years.",1559347314

Also, how she reacts to you bringing it up may give you some peace of mind. Just beware if she gets very defensive or angry. Anxiety is a real bitch because it often comes up for no reason at all, but sometimes your subconscious can pick up signals you don‚Äôt otherwise notice and your anxiety is a way to try to get you to notice the thing.

"fifaclubs","t5_2zdn7","Not started a league myself, but I've known and occasionally advised a few people who have.

Your biggest issue, by far, is getting enough teams on to start it.

It's a balancing act of where you invest effort - having a decent enough website and/or USP to get people interested and getting enough managers in, but making sure you don't bring in those who will flake.

A high number of default wins is usually what drives teams away. No one joins sites to sit in a lobby for 30 minutes, chalk up 3 points and leave.

So be careful of expanding too quickly and diluting the standard of teams. I'd have some way of vetting would-be managers, even if it's harsh, in order to ensure more reliable teams - no under 18 managers, you need 5 players agreeing to sign before you get given a team, criteria like that.

 The other thing (down the line, if you need the help) is making sure you have fair and reliable admins/mods. Again, some arguably harsh criteria are probably necessary.

Then some rules - assigning people to specific areas to limit confusion, admins can't make decisions that affect their own club (even indirectly, like with a rival team), and any decisions that fall within their area that affect their club must be instead dealt with (or at least ratified) by someone else - in order to curtail bias (or accusations thereof).

It's difficult to find good admins - they don't get paid and it takes time, so it attracts people who have a tendency towards power trips. And when sites get someone who is a bit of a prick but is willing to put the work in, they tend to turn a blind eye through necessity. But it does sour the taste of a site for players when you have admins that are inconsistent, rude, or don't respond.

Also, having clear-cut rules helps. What is time wasting, what is keeper blocking, what is poor conduct - and what is the punishment for that (or at least the minimum punishment). When are things are decided on a case-by-case basis and when are they standardised. In essence, transparency.

And for the love of God, not every pro clubs site has to be a three or four letter acronym. VFL, FGL, VFA, VPFL, VPC... having a name that isn't yet another jumble of letters would definitely help it to stand out. Even if you have to come up with a shortened version to help it roll of the tongue, the answer isn't always acronyms.",1559347315
"childfree","t5_2qtwb","I think getting a tubal could really force him to be more honest. 

It's obvious you don't want to have kids and it's totally your prerogative to get fixed! If you've had trouble with other forms of birth control in the past, I'd totally look more seriously into sterilization. Once my 5 year IUD runs it's course, I think it will be a toss-up for me between getting a 10 year replacement or just getting my tubes tied. 

However, I would not be surprised if this turned out be a dealbreaker for your BF. The fact that he'd rather get a vasectomy because ""its reversible"" than let you do what you damn well please with your tubes indicates to me that he's either on the fence or is secretly hoping you're going to change your mind about kids one day.

These are great machines with a loyal following and not a lot of them were made. I learned (after I bought it) that the plastic for these things is practically unobtainable now, making them almost worthless if the bodywork is thrashed and pretty valuable if it is in good shape. 

I haven't sold this yet, but here is ours. Had to make lots of body repairs and repaint the thing. Fixed some small mechanical stuff and now it runs and looks great. 39k miles and I expect it to go for $3k ish.

Homeschool programs, however, are supposed to be equivalent to public schools, so parents are encouraged to include math, social studies, science, and language arts -- but there is no actual mandate. Depending on what they are behind on and what education they have been getting, it could amount to neglect, but it could also be determined that the topics of instruction fall under the parent's prerogative to select.

"Cartalk","t5_2s47e","First, I would highly recommend this book:  [Haynes Automotive Body Repair &amp; Painting](https://haynes.com/en-us/automotive-body-repair-painting-haynes-techbook)

It has great explorations of all the essential techniques, methods, etc. Great reference.

Next, you will need supplies: sandpaper, touch-up paint, buffing compound, and an electric buffer. I recommend this one, from Harbor Freight: https://www.harborfreight.com/7-in-10-amp-heavy-duty-digital-variable-speed-polisher-62297.html. I‚Äôve been using it for years. Also pickup a short pile wool buffing pad.

For the compound, I recommend Meguiars 105. It‚Äôs like $30/bottle, but it‚Äôs good stuff.

For sandpaper, I actually recommend sanding sponges. They make it easier to maintain a level surface. You should be able to find them at your local auto parts store. Get one each of 320, 1000, and 2000 (if a size around 600-800 is available, get that too).

Finally the touch up paint can be found at your dealer, or you can buy a color-matched touch up pen from automotivetouchup.com.

The process goes like this:

1. Clean the area with soap and water and dry thoroughly 
2. Buff all affected areas and wipe off remaining residue. Some of the damage will likely buff out.
3. Dip the 320 sanding pad in water, and gently sand the scrapes. Try to feather the edges to smooth the transition between the scrape and surrounding paint
4. Dry the area, then apply touch up paint, using as little as possible. Bolt any droplets the form. 
5. Apply multiple coats until the paint is up the level of the surrounding paint.
6. Lightly sand the paint level with the 320 grit paper using the wet sanding method.
7. Apply more touch up paint if needed to leave the surface m

A very long story short, my friend is going through a divorce. It's messy. I am neutral with her (soon to be ex) husband and former in laws. 

Things have escalated to the point where both sides are slinging mud and there's court orders barring her from her kids. I do not know what is true, nor care at this point. 

I want to get my Godchildren and take them on a day trip to a local park with my kids so they can chill out and catch Pokemon, see someone who has no agenda, etc. 

Would I be the asshole if I called her husband to get the kids without consulting her? If I was to ""ask for her blessing"" all she would do is attempt to have me violate the order on her behalf, and I'm not here for the drama... Just the kids.

If anything the biggest difference between meh, and holy shit this is good was the holding time.  iirc, they hold chicken under the heat lamp for no more than 10 minutes.

"submarines","t5_2s3g2","I think it's extraordinarily unlikely.  Modern submarines, which are optimized for submerged performance, are not well suited to deck guns.  They rarely have flat superstructures to mount a gun and roll heavily on the surface because of their round hulls.  The gun would induce a large amount of drag and slow the submarine underwater.  And most importantly, it would leave the submarine extremely vulnerable on the surface.  For many of these reasons, the Germans abandoned deck guns halfway through WWII, and they've been gone ever since.

Also, surface warships and other submarines are the primary targets for modern submarines, and unarmed merchant shipping is not a major target anymore.


&gt;As a side question, was there any submarine class introduced after the war, that had originally a deck gun?

The Soviet [Whiskey](https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/613_1949-cutaway.jpg) and [Zulu](http://www.deepstorm.ru/DeepStorm.files/45-92/dts/611/611%20shema%20-1.gif) diesel-electrics, which were first introduced in the late 1940s, did originally have deck guns, but they were quickly removed. As far as I am aware, these were the only submarines built in large numbers after the war to have any gun armament.

Some of the WWII-era U.S. Fleet boats retained deck guns into the 1960s.  The last submarines to have deck guns were the [*Perch*](http://navsource.org/archives/08/312/0831333.jpg) and [*Sealion*](http://www.navsource.org/archives/08/0831515.jpg), which had a 40 mm Bofors guns until they were decommissioned in 1967 and 1970, respectively.",1559347320

Not in my opinion, your guns are your bread and butter. Take the main battery mod 3. Use your smokes and farm from them.

Yes. You feast on other DDs with ease and it's hard to get rid of you unless you get fixed inside a smoke with radar. However, you're no Kitakaze/Harugumo so you aren't as good dealing with BBs. With only 10km torp range and carriers in play matches can be difficult.",1559347320

It wasn't really just 2017. It was last year too. He did have a strong month last year but my issue with him in past years is the whole ""he didn't get enough consistent at bats"" argument. Because he definitely did and only really showed up one month. 

Heres how I saw this and it happened multiple times last year:

He would pinch hit home run off of the bench, start the next day, hit a home run and a double. Start and homer the next 3-5 games and get starts for the next 2 weeks and be a fucking ghost for those 2 weeks. Like literally after hitting 5 home runs and 4 or 5 doubles he would go 0 for his next 40 and drop back down to the bench. And this has been a pattern of his for a while. It's hard to keep playing someone when they disappear like that. 

He did it earlier this year. The same exact pattern early in April. I think it was like April 2nd-april6th he was hitting like .471 with 5 home runs and a few doubles. But then he STARTED the next 13 of 15 games and went like 2 for 38.

I literally called both sides of it word for word on April 1st I told my brother: Ok he pinch hit home run its time to start him for the next week. On April 7th I said: ok time to bench him he's gonna suck for the next 2 weeks. Sure enough he dropped off for a couple of weeks.

BUT
I will absolutely be the first to admit it looks like he's changing the way he approaches his at bats. He's shortened up his swing and it's balancing out his over swinging. If he can continue this trend he's on right now then he's got my vote. But  he's still got some proving to do. And I hope he proves me wrong cause that'd awesome for the team.",1559347320

Well, I don‚Äôt feel that way anymore - this is a cool little album, I was hooked from the first song to the last. Really like the stylistic similarity, totally get the comparison to FM! I‚Äôd say there are some misses, notably Tay Keith‚Äôs cut and the aforementioned ‚ÄúSpeedboat‚Äù, although they both flow well enough when you‚Äôre just listening through the record and I can‚Äôt say they‚Äôre straight up bad, just not as interesting.

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","&gt; Even if I agreed with that, the next person I ask isn't going to say the same thing.  

Yes, I find most people don't use technical descriptions well.

&gt; I think you're barreling towards confusion when you try to ""reclaim"" or  even ""correct"" the main common terms since they're the fuzziest and most  broadly used.  

I'm not reclaiming anything.  The meaning of the word I'm using literally hasn't changed.

People who are moderate conservatives and moderate liberals have just gotten lazy.

&gt; I groan so hard whenever people use the ""liberal = capitalist""  definition. Like, the fact that it's technically correct hardly matters  when 95% of the people you meet on the street don't know that. We're all  kinda slaves to that nonsense. 

That's their problem not mine.  

&gt; Like, the capitalization stuff throws me because it controls what you can start a sentence with and that's just too much. 

Or you just write the sentence normally, and let context do it's job.

&gt; Why not call yourself a sorta-maybe socialist? Or a medium marxist? 

Because none of those are accurate.  Why don't you call yourself a Pretend-Socialist?  Same reason.

&gt; Or just get real confusing with it so that people are forced to ask  since calling yourself a liberal or a conservative or a moderate are all  broad unspecific categories that people still think they got a general  handle on. 

But a **M**oderate is something specific.

&gt; But applied to you could easily be misleading to the uninformed. 

Which is why I usually don't have an issue explaining.

&gt; Maybe co-op capitalist? 

No

&gt; Incorporate an innuendo maybe? 

Doesn't make sense.  No

&gt; A left-right reacharound? 

Vulgar and insulting.

And still no.

Quite frankly I was willing to compromise if you follow my conversation with the mods.  But now I'm starting to come back to the idea of ""No, you accommodate me.""",1559347322

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","To be fair the Blue Tenno was somewhat using their jaded perspective to skew Nightwave to the red Tenno who is obviously a newer Tenno.

For example, Blue acts as of Nitain was raining from the heavens with Alerts when they were 4 randomly spawning Alerts per day.
There was no static Nitain schedule. For many players the Alerts came up while they were not at home so the alerts were honestly no different than now.

For me personally, I was lucky to get 1 Nitain Alert a day more than 3 Nitain a week (I have the app), usually the alerts popped while I was asleep, at work, in traffic, at an appointment.

With Nightwave I now have 63 Nitain. (Never thought I'd see the day.)

Yeah, the downtime sucks.

Danielle on PS4 @ 4 &amp; I believe Rebecca said somewhere on the forums that it's taking longer because DE is:

- Implementing multiple areas of feedback from the community to ensure Season 2 is enjoyable &amp; doesn't feel like a job/torture.
- Ensuring the ""catch-up"" UI, selection, &amp; etc works well.
- Syncing all the platforms. Because to have them out of sync might cause issues with challenges or unexpected bugs that crop up.
- Implementing the unique features of this Nightwave. (I guess it'll be more than just a new invader &amp; random spawning npcs)
- Polishing Nightwave to make it overall a better experience for all players.

I'm frustrated it's gone too but I'd rather they release it in a good state than it get forced out &amp; mirror Wolf of Saturn Six &amp; then have to sit through all the ""Did DE even listen to feedback?"" Threads &amp; comments folks would make.
Reminds me of the Weapon pass they did...where DE got reamed for basically doing what people asked for.

I hope if anything, DE is looking at this feedback &amp; will start making Nitain a reward in more areas.
Such as rotations in Defense/Survival/Excavation/Rathuum missions instead of ""1000 Credits"", 50 Endo, etc.

I wouldn't mind if Aura Mods had a chance to be found in Caches (instead of 1000 credits, 50-100 Endo, common resources, &amp; common mods, etc), flawless Defection wave clears, flawless Spy Vault runs (instead of 1000 credits, 100 Endo, Common Resources...) or hell as an alternative reward for Lua Challenge Rooms.

Nightwave should be the easier way but not the only way.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Mine was back in 2.0. Queued up Ampador Keep as MNK(full ilvl 90 gear and had up to T4 killed at the time). Got paired with a BLM still in ilvl 55 gear with a lvl 49 weap, a WAR and WHM with varied pieces of 70 and 90 gear. Run went pretty smooth up until the last boss. Due to the low output of the BLM I went on add duty to nuke them down. Then it started. The WHM exploded at me for not hitting the boss cause my dps sucks (during the time that melee was bullied) and that the BLM should kill them. I just ignored them and kept nuking every add ASAP with the WHM still bitching me out. Boss is dying at a slow pace but just enough to beat the enrage. Then the WHM decides to stay behind the pillar near the boss so they don't have to move for the AOE. 2nd phase of the boss starts with the tethers and orbs and they hit every single one. Dropping it at the pillar and having them explode on the tank, getting them both killed. We wipe and make our way back to the boss while WHM keeps bitching at me and the tank for being bad at the game. Tank tried to tell them what they did wrong but they wouldn't have and kept going. 2 more wipes after that and the tank rage quits. WHM then gets a buddy to join in, same thing happens over and over. Tank he called in tries to tell him to stay away but he targets me with the bitching after that while praising the BLM for being a BLM, last 10m of the times and I had enough. I just stood there at the entrance for the last 10m and made a sandwich while watching them lose their shit.",1559347327

Know that if you are playing warlock or priest and going alliance, you will have to deal with undead which can remove fear, and for warrior/rogue/paladin/druid/any other stun I can't think of, orcs have a 25% chance to resist stun, which both are considered god pvp racials in vanilla. I was going to play Orc Warlock (best pvp warlock imo, stun resist chance = counters most annoying cc's, and you counter priests anyway and don't have to deal with undead warlocks so your biggest counters are more stun-based classes) but my friends have been wanting to play alliance, now I can't see myself playing anything other than NE druid. Though Tauren druid gets stun and more health, and herbalism+15(even as herbalist idc about this one) I would rather be NE because it's my favorite race and shadowmelding is fun, despite it being almost entire useless as I can stealth anyway as a druid and shadowmeld isn't usable in combat in vanilla, it's a 10second invis that you can use while eating though!",1559347327

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","Right. What I'm saying is that a lot of people view the eShop screenshots in portable mode. However, these screenshots, if they're legit Switch screenshots, are most likely taken in docked mode. 

If Doom runs at 720p in docked mode, and at 540p in portable mode, then looking at the docked mode Doom screenshots in portable mode will make the game look sharper than it actually runs. So, if you look at the eShop screenshots for Doom it looks noticeably better than in-game while viewing them in portable mode, because you're looking at 720p screenshots of a game that only runs at 540p.

Edit: the reason I'm making this point is because the fellow redditor I responded to said Switch screenshots are often sharpened, but that's not necessarily the case. People are just viewing them in portable mode.

Everything is true: in Dragonlance the world was built by the local gods themselves. In the Forgotten Realms, there could be another story. In other worlds perhaps the gods arose after civilization arose. Or, the creation myths of the Norse, Greek, and Egyptian pantheons. Maybe all three at once. All are true.

The bigger issue, I think, has been more with exotic heavies being near mandatory in serious content. I don't think anyone would argue that Ace is lackluster in PvE, but I don't really see it used all that much, either.

Guns like Bygones, Blast Furnace, Go Figure, Spare Rations, and Midnight Coup can all do the job adequately, while, at least historically, no legendary can compete with the best exotic heavies.",1559347331

It appears to be shooting roots from the top of the stem, and we don‚Äôt know why. In terrestrial plants, you‚Äôll often see this if it‚Äôs lacking water but that is obviously not an issue here. So we thought maybe it‚Äôs struggling to find nutrients, but it appears to have some very healthy dense new growth. 

He didn‚Äôt lay down any dirt or substrate soil, just the gravel that you can see in the picture and some ‚Äúfertilizer pellets‚Äù

http://immigration-lawyer.com/travel-ban-dual-nationals/

It seems like the gov't has issued a clarifications regarding dual nationals who holds citizenship to non-banned countries a month after it's original guidance, which I wasn't aware of. Both my old school and my current employer had advisory against all students or employees  who are nationals with the ban countries regardless of the dual citizenship or not to not leave the country, so that was other thing that confused me too. Again terribly sorry for giving you a hard time.

My last piece of advice especially regarding your original question: 

1. Things change all the time, and this administration tend to change its interpretation of its laws and policy constantly. You need to be vigilant to the things going on and there is no guarantee that you will continue to be safe in the future.

2. Not all employer may not be aware of all things related to immigration and they might be hesitant in hiring you with concerns that you wouldn't be able to secure work authorization on time.",1559347332

You can argue that they will be more ready to make a deal if you are unreasonable but what leverage is there? Trump only seems concerned about swinging his dick around and getting the ""best"" deal which is never going to happen you have to give at some point, he seems incapable. Other nations and leaders don't want to be seen as weak either.  

Instead he constantly says there are ""talks"" going on, pushing things back and his supporters fawn his praises.

"classicwow","t5_3eb8a","the patch in wotlk where they buffed titans grip was the closest thing to the feeling of being an overgeared pvp warrior in vanilla.

2 shotting cloth is not uncommon if you have gear, and many of the movement utilities arent really needed, since the other classes are lacking them too.

the frost trinket was basically the proto spell reflect, and pallies do shit for damage so you can just ignore their bubble.

if you played arena, vanilla pvp is more chaotic and requires a much more adaptive playstyle. (i.e. trinketing at a ""sub optimal"" time, can often screw your oponents game plan up enough to land 1-2 extra hits which is generally all it takes to win if you are geared)",1559347333

Obama couldn't unilaterally end the drone program when the Pentagon's budget was decided years ago, but he could speak on it, which he did.  Obama couldn't just end Prism, because that's not how a federalist system works; 50 state budgets and federal budget working in tandem.

Unfortunately it sounds like the parents of that child will now need to be more careful at buffets and such, knowing that their daughter has such an adverse reaction to spicy foods. 

Your aunt is acting like you were negligent or purposely hurt a child. You did nothing of the sort. You, nor anyone else, we're negligent. You all really tried to ensure people would know that the wings were spicy.

In fact, the report is saying that the US, in particular, is helping Syria ""destroy"" the country. The only difference is that the US is not contributing to the ""destruction of the country"".

One common argument I hear is that it's the US that is helping to ""destroy"" the country because they have ""abandoned"" the ""liberties"" (i.e. ""the US doesn't have to go"" to ""destroy"" the country) in Iraq, while this is false.

In contrast, the US is not directly contributing to ""destroy"" the country. They're indirectly supporting those who are ""destroying"" the country, by providing them with weapons, by paying the salaries for those who are killing people, while supporting those who are helping to ""destroy"" the country.",1559347339

You get this a maximum of once per seat, it's never going to affect the result in a constituency and if the number found to be fraudulently cast is above the seat margin  (after a recount) then it's immediately investigated by the electoral commission, who can invalidate the result for the seat.

&amp;#x200B;

Seems a classic case here of domga being put ahead of reality, it's not an issue that has ever effected a seats result, yet people want to put in place a punitive voting system that would block and discourage magnitudes more voters...

&amp;#x200B;

Like go after lower hanging fruit, moan about students double voting or postal vote fraud, this \[stealing someones vote before they go\] is such a non-issue it's insane to debate it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Cuckolding. *Important disclaimer*: I don't personally find it ""weird"" myself but I'm mentioning it here because I know that many people do.

How I found out: My wife comes from South Korea. A few years ago I was living there together with her (I'm from Western Europe). Back then we weren't married yet. At one point during that time, my best friend from back home came to visit me/us. He stayed with me in my little apartment studio (my girlfriend still lived with her parents, as is quite usual in South Korea when you're in your early 20s). He and I had a lot of fun together, I showed him the city etc. We are super close and have been best friends since childhood. We've grown up together, gone through puberty together, experienced all the awkward moments of those years together, know all of each other's secrets and so forth. The friendship is very trusting and intimate. He is also very chill and open-minded, which is something I've always greatly appreciated about him.

During his visit, my girlfriend suggested that the three of us could go on a little 2-day trip together to the sea. He loved the idea and I hadn't been able to see much of the Korean countryside yet, so I loved it too. We traveled to this cute little fishing village with great seafood and a pretty beach (too cold to swim though). Our hotel was rather old and run-down but somehow charming in its own way. The hotel room wasn't the same as western hotel rooms. Instead, there was one big room which was furnished like a living room with a couch an a TV. The two queen-size beds were built into the wall, a bit like large wooden closets with a curtain for privacy (almost like in a medieval castle). In between the beds was a thin wooden wall.

When we came back to the hotel after dinner, it was still quite early. The hotel did not offer wifi, so we had to kill time the old-fashioned way. We all sat on the large, comfy couch with my girlfriend in the middle and began to chat. Nothing particularly serious, just some light, humorous convo. Suddenly, this extremely strange image popped up in front of my inner eye. One of my girlfriend's legs was sort of lying on my friend's knee - not in a flirty way though. Just in a casual way and because there wasn't enough space. In fact, neither of them had *ever* acted flirty with the other person in the remotest way on any occasion that I could remember. There had never been any reason for jealousy on my part whatsoever. However, as I now saw them sitting there next to each other, I suddenly had this image of my girlfriend suddenly crawling onto him, sitting on his lap and starting to passionately make out with him. The strange fantasy made me jealous but what confused me even more was that it also really turned me on. The longer the conversation went on, the more I struggled to focus on what was being said because I had all these images in front of my inner eye. I saw them French-kiss, then my friend kneading her tight butt in her jeans, my girlfriend unbuttoning her shirt, him taking off her bra, her breathing getting faster and heavier... I have absolutely zero idea where these images came from. I had never before thought about this stuff and if anyone had told me about this kink, I probably would've replied that it sounds weird. And yet, here I was, imagining it and getting insanely horny from my fantasies.

After an hour or so, we decided that it was a little boring to just sit around, so we went outside one more time. We found a convenience store and bought some alcohol that we took back to the hotel. Then we sat back down on the couch, continued to chat and got tipsy. I had hoped that my thoughts would disappear by going out to the fresh air but they didn't. And now that we were all getting a little drunk, the images and sounds in my head only became stronger and more vivid. The whole thing really freaked me out because I had never heard of cuckolding. I didn't know this was a thing. For all I knew, I was the only person on the planet that had ever felt this way and I was probably going insane. At the same time, though, my horniness now became so strong that I almost *wished* they would start something. I got up from the couch to give them more space on the couch and turned on some music. My girlfriend was quite tipsy and I thought maybe this way something would happen. However, they remained perfectly ""proper"". They didn't even say mildly flirty things such as: ""I like your hair"" or something like that. At one point my friend said in a completely casual tone: ""alright guys, I think we've drunk enough and it's time to go to bed. I'm getting tired."" I quickly disappeared in one of the beds behind the curtain while they cleaned up the bottles, hoping something small would happen. In my fantasy, they made each other a few compliments and - because of the alcohol - ended up accidentally giving each other a peck on the lips. They then profusely apologized to me... only to be told that I actually find it super hot and that they should continue. This was not what happened though. In reality, they just said ""good night"" in a friend-like tone and my girlfriend climbed into bed. Soon after I heard my friend climb in the other bed. I was so horny that I undressed my girlfriend and we ended up having sex. I didn't dare to tell her anything about my strange thoughts because I thought she would laugh at me or get angry. As we were having sex I continued to fantasize about this whole scenario though. Considering there was only a curtain on one side and a thin wooden plate on the other, I was sure my friend heard everything, especially my girlfriend's moaning. I asked myself how he felt about it because my girlfriend is/was very hot/pretty and he had once casually mentioned that he finds her very pretty. I asked myself if hearing her moan turned him on or if he was completely indifferent about it. I asked myself if he jerked off listening to us and thinking of my naked girlfriend getting fucked by him instead of me, or if he simply went to sleep.

The next day, my strange new thoughts still hadn't disappeared. This confused me even more. I had assumed that it's the kind of thing you find hot when you're horny but once you cum, you don't find it hot anymore. I had cum with my girlfriend but the thoughts hadn't disappeared. For the next few days I felt super weird and I acted really distant toward my friend. He was extremely confused because we hadn't had a fight or anything. He tried to ask me but I just reacted in a grumpy way, saying I didn't want to talk. This was really not my style. Usually we always talked things out. It took me months to figure out my feelings and it was only 2-3 years later when I finally confessed them to my best friend and explained to him why I had been acting so grumpy/distant during those days.",1559347340

Right before the procedure, my friend had a little pang of emotion. The nurse/assistant patted my friend's arm and told my friend that she understood, that it was ok and that she herself has had 13 abortions. And that her 3 kids were more enough. Just hang in there, things get easier.

I also live your gardening enthusiasm, it‚Äôs infectious üòä 

I just have one comment/ question: do the tails grow well in the ground? I‚Äôve never seen them planted in the ground before - always thought they were hanging plants only, but I suppose they can grow in the ground just fine...but then the question is what happens when they get so tall that they topple over (as they will be want to do)? I would think a lot the little leaves would get dislodged from the friction? (But then maybe they‚Äôll prop and you‚Äôll get a bunch of them)? You have so much room for hanging baskets, I would personally hang them, especially in tx they‚Äôll get so much sun and thrive! 

Also it‚Äôs super awesome you have a grapefruit tree!! And a very stupid followup: do you eat the grapefruits? I‚Äôve never had a fruit bearing tree but I can imagine I might actually like eating grapefruit if I grew it myself. I bet it tastes like pure satisfaction! 

Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful gardens, I wish you much success this growing season! If you make any update posts please tag me so I can marvel the progress!

Well, it's a question of do the ends justify the means. 

The end is a world that seems somewhat conformist, where the top scientists are believed and people largely don't question them.

I don't see that as good for science, nor likely to gain much traction.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","I used to be anti-feminist, and I would even say anti-women, until I was raped by an older man. I used to be so ashamed of being a girl, and would fantasise about being a boy like the characters in my favourite books, tv shows and videogames (because they had adventures and got to do all the cool stuff, but everything made for girls was super boring). I really thought I was 'not like the other girls', but in hindsight I now realise that was entirely due to being conditioned into thinking that girls were weak, boring, shallow, etc. and all the self-loathing that caused for me.

When I started processing what happened to me at around age 18/19, I started researching sexual assault and rape, and was shocked (and kind of comforted) when I found countless stories by women and girls who had similar experiences. It was a huge turning point to realise that I was exactly like other girls. Those discussions led me to feminism.

If you are cool with just dropping 5 to 10k and losing it because you are helping a family who deserves some help, you are approaching it in a good way. Also, you know that most businesses fail, right? that just needs to be on your radar and know that food isn't exactly known for its stellar margins. 

If you are doing anything *other* than just throwing money at your SIL, a good way to help prevent family issues is to have a rock solid agreement going into it with all parties having a good idea of how it is going to work.

If equity, you have to talk about how you are going to get paid. Like, what is the benefit of owning 5% of a food truck company? Does it mean anything? When, how, and how much are you going to get paid? Does the truck get paid first, she gets paid first, or you? Any are ok, but just understand what profit is and the details of when you get paid.

Pretty much the same with a loan, but probably easier. When do you get paid and what is the rate? Why aren't they getting a bank loan and should that impact your rate?",1559347345

So I'm heading to a concert with my best friend of 17 years in June and my girlfriend as it turns out is going to see the same band in June with her male colleague (who I've never met at all). I asked if it was the same show and if it was said we could meet up. She said it didn't matter if it was the same show or not because she won't meet up with me because it's 'effort' (how much effort is it to text I'm standing at X place, before the show?) 

The excuse sounds like total BS to me and on top of some other things I'm just really pissed by the whole thing. 

For context the other things are the we haven't had sex in a while because she apparently hasn't had any urges whatsoever, we hardly ever talk and she's just recently moved into her own place after saying that she didn't want to move in with me after we planned and budgeted for it. 

Am I the asshole here?

""A young man grills hamburgers the old fashioned way before fast food. I‚Äôm a big fan of everyday scenes that capture the tapestry of life in the early 20th century. This image was a great technical challenge, with a lot of signage, reflections and details that really tested my patience. My favourite detail is the hamburger patties browning on the side touching the grill, which has about 16 layers of colours on it.The signage is as authentic as I can make it, if not sourcing the posters used, then branding from the same campaign or advertising run using the brand's colours. Royal Crown Cola is still sold today, and 7-Up‚Äôs signage was actually predominantly black and red until the 1940s. The billboards at the top were a challenge but I narrowed down the poster on the right to be Pan-Am Motor Oils‚Äô ‚ÄòElla Cinders‚Äô character which appeared in comics, they are now collector's items. The poster on the right is advertising the 1938 feature film Spawn of the North starring George Raft, Akim Tamiroff and Louis Platt - filmed in Alaska and produced by Paramount Pictures, whose logo you can see if you look closely."" --J.J.

"vuejs","t5_38jhw","I'm a big fan of TypeScript, and using it as much as possible is a high priority for me. 

Do you think React is overall better in regards to using with TypeScript?  And what about with Next.js?

It would be amazing to me if typescript was the default way of doing things in either React or Vue, and it would probably make me pick whichever one did it.  Cause it's been kinda hard learning from non-TS examples, and whenever I run into problems (especially with nuxt), I'm never quite sure if TS is related to my bug.

&gt; custom HTML templating instead of just using JavaScript, like react.

I also kinda considered this a downside of Vue initially.  And JSX appealed to me seeing that I'm more a programmer/backend guy than frontend.  So I generally prefer a proper programming language over something made just for templating, e.g. I just use plain PHP for templating on PHP projects rather than any of the template libs.

I only played around with React a little bit... but in that short time, JSX felt even more like a mishmash of programming/templating than Vue does, and I never quite grokked when to and when not to use `{}`

Anyway, I'm not making a statement here... just pointing out how it felt with my limited experience of both, and wondering if at some stage you felt the same way about JSX, but then changed your mind later or something?  The ""it's just javascript"" thing appeals to me a lot, but then it looks like Vue for the most part is more pragmatic on balance.

I still haven't completely decided between using React or Vue on my own big+long term projects, I've spent more time building with Vue... it takes me a long time to make these decisions.  Appreciate any feedback you might have related to any of my thoughts above.",1559347348

"asexuality","t5_2qv0q","This is a little worrying. Sex should add joy to your life, not be a stressful problem to solve. 

It's one thing to feel a little insecure when you show no interest in touch but he knows you're asexual, and yet he keeps having these unresolved conversations. Because he wants to wear you down. Which is working: you want to ""get it over with"". He doesn't seem to care how you feel about it.

You're old enough to know what you like and don't like. If you want to do it to get emotional fulfillment from making him happy, that's fine. But by no means should you feel like it's an obligation. 

If you still want to do this, sit down and discuss what you are comfortable with, how far, how fast, what the signs are, etc. Remember that just because you're asexual it doesn't mean your discomfort doesn't matter. It should still be an enjoyable activity for you. If it's a chore, don't do it. Quit midway. It's okay. Also remember that PIV is a very small part of sex and there should be way more physical intimacy before and afterwards. Also, sex isn't just male orgasms. If you want to have an orgasm, instruct your bf how to help you with that, which is why it's important to explore with yourself and know your body first. 

Your bf is an adult. He can understand that you care about him in your own way. If he acts like sex is the only way you can prove your love to him, you have a red flag in your hands.",1559347349

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","S:  The most polished games in the series, mechanic-wise.  Great sprites and music.

A: Solid titles that I can replay anytime.  2nd gen is dated in terms of mechanics, but I still respect it immensely and think they were great for their time.  The gap in B2W2 and BW is due to B2W2 including older Pok√©mon before the post game.  Also, starting in an area different from the originals was really jarring but I ended up loving it.  Made it seem like you were an actual citizen in the region.

B: I always liked how Yellow followed the show more.  I‚Äôd love a game that did that today.  The GBA games are good but are just a little too primitive for my taste to be replayable anytime.  As for why 2nd gen is above them, I like Johto more than Kanto and Hoenn.

C: Knowing what the later games add, 1st gen is too simple.  It‚Äôs also incredibly glitchy, however, I respect it for starting it all, and the music is iconic.  BW were good mechanically, but I absolutely despised a good portion of Unova Pok√©mon.  Wasn‚Äôt a fan of anything the C-Gear added either, as it seemed tacked on.  X and Y were unfortunate cases for me, as I liked most of the Pok√©mon introduced, and Kalos was a good region, but X and Y started a downward trend of over simplifying, gen 1 pandering, and unraveling very polished aspects of the game for the sake of making it easier.  ORAS has the same issues as X and Y, but had way more cutscenes that slowed the pace.  Being able to fly to any route was cool though.

D: I liked a lot of 7th gens Pok√©mon, but I hated the Alola region.  It was too difficult to navigate and I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the Trial gimmick.  The real kicker for these games though is the lack of a National Pok√©dex.  As a collector, this kills any sort of post game drive for me.  Also, telling you which moves were effective or not was unnecessary.  Let people learn about the world and type relationships.  The Let‚Äôs Go games are pretty much everything I dislike about Pok√©mon.  I think if they were considered spin offs I‚Äôd be fine with them, but when they were confirmed as main series games, it made me terrified for the future of the series.  Luckily (in my opinion at least) Sword and Shield look to be going back.",1559347350

My opinion of the sub at large remains quite favorable, and the fund-raising drive more than makes up for any toxicity therein.

Mate what does linking two random ass posts have to do with your argument? they are clearly meme made in jest one of which is as milquetoast as you can get so i do not see the point in linking them aside to make it seem like you know what you are talking about ""because you have sources""...

&gt;edit 2: Several commenters have pointed out that my original summary may have implied a direct line between the actor's responses and the pledge drives. This is not the case. Rather, the recent outpouring of good-will is a response to the spike in negativity on r/freefolk in the wake of Turner/Hempstead-Wright's comments.

Um, You **did** directly link them as being related so i am unsure how saying ""it's not the case"" negates what you already said and the conclusion people were able to draw from it. You now assert there was a ""spike of negativity"" which i feel is you again blowing something completely out of proportion since you can't tell the difference between a meme and actual negativity in the form of death threats and ""fuck these people"" hate threads i have seen in other subreddits.",1559347350

Hi folks,First off, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's picked up the game! Operation Hardcore has been my best-selling game so far, and I really do appreciate the support.I also wanted to let you know about my next game: TOXICANT, a first-person survival-horror with roguelike elements (permadeath, randomized levels, etc.). I liken it to a cross between Spelunky and Outlast, both of which are definite influences for me. If this sounds interesting to you, head on over to the store page and click the wishlist button so I know!Secondly, I've been toying with the idea of doing some DLC for Operation Hardcore for a while now, and I wanted to gauge interest. The DLC would be largely standalone (i.e. a separate ""episode""), and likely single player, as many of the things I want to do simply don't translate well to local co-op. Some of the ideas I'm kicking around:Halloween-themedmore inspiration from early DOS action games (Bio Menace, Halloween Harry), perhaps even an FM/AdLib soundtracka little more ""open"", i.e. scrolling in all directions, ladders, jetpacks, rooms that can be entered, interconnected areas, etc.dual-wielding, more pickups, new weaponsI'm currently debating whether I tackle this next, or continue on with TOXICANT.If either of these things sound interesting to you, please click the like button, comment, or consider joining my Discord and sharing your thoughts.Likewise, if you enjoy Operation Hardcore or my other games, please consider following my developer page or becoming a patron.Thanks again for your support, I couldn't do this with you guys!Adam/Cosmocat

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I think there are a lot more reasonable conservatives than people are willing to admit.  Mostly, they keep their mouth shut when not around their own because of how hyper-aggressive social media and the public can be toward anything that smells even a little like conservatism.

There are also plenty of in betweeners.  Take my boss, for example.  Very religious, but one of the kindest and most generous people I know.  He does not care where you are from or what you believe.  His church organizes outreach for Muslim immigrants.  The last one I heard about, they helped a female Muslim immigrant start her own business so she could be self sufficient here in America.  Over the years, he has probably done more for me, personally, than anyone else in my life.  Never expects a thing in return.  Works in technology, college educated, etc.

Sounds great and reasonable, but he has deep scars thanks to mistreatment by the media and social media.  He is as much against *illegal* immigration as any other conservative, and the media twists any opposition against such into hatred of immigrants or foreigners in general.  In short, he has watched them lie, very thoroughly, about people just like him, with beliefs just like his, for many years, and he has seen the public respond to it with hatred and ridicule.

The result?  He supports Trump.  He thinks the media is lying about him.  Which they do to an extent, but he thinks *all* of it is lies.  He is hostile to any notion to the contrary.  The media used up all of his trust by telling blatant lies about beliefs he holds, again and again, and it has caused serious emotional damage.  In this way, he is *not* reasonable, but there's blame to go around for that IMO.

Myself, I am an agnostic independent who leans conservative.  I don't hate gays or minorities or immigrants.  I do believe in borders, pragmatism, the free market, and pride/loyalty to my country beyond what it can do to help me, personally.  I see people like Putin as evidence that America and its people need to be strong and firm, rather than growing complacent and focusing exclusively on personal comforts and problems.  I believe in respect for beliefs I do not agree with, just as I believe in thoughtful consideration of issues like abortion rather than simply jumping on a ""rights"" vs ""morals"" bandwagon.  After all, who gets to say when a person becomes a person and has a right to life?  That needs to be defined and *justified* somehow.  I am not and have never been a fan of Trump, who I did NOT vote for.  I also do not hate liberals or even necessarily liberal ideals.  I just question their practicality in today's world.  I would love to live to see a star trek like society where money is a thing of the past.  I just do not think we are there yet, because scarcity and because the masses do not take pride in themselves and their work the way they do on TV.",1559347351

But then did end up aaking about where did she meet the other guy and another general question of what he was doing nowadays. We stopped the chat there.

Anyway, this one day we were out doing the rounds and I helped a dead lamb be birthed by a ewe with fly strike. To start with we thought the lamb was simply stuck, so I went to help. Turns out the lamb was stillborn, and the maggots from the fly strike had crawled up into her to eat it. When I started pulling the lamb, it broke in half on the way out and maggots came spilling out with it.

My wife left me (virtually out of nowhere, but this isn‚Äôt about that) a year and a half ago. Let me tell you, it‚Äôs hard as fuck being an actual active single parent. I see my daughter everyday except Sunday. She stays with me twice a week, and the rest of the time she sleeps at her moms house. I work a first shift job. I get up at 2am, work at 3am, and typically work 10-12 hour days. I pick my daughter up and she‚Äôs with me until her mom get off work at 6:30. By the time I get home it‚Äôs 7:20. Typically go to bed around 8:30-9 then do it all again. I don‚Äôt get much sleep and I definitely don‚Äôt get time for myself because by the time I‚Äôm alone I have to go to sleep. It‚Äôs really hard not having another supportive partner to tag in after a long day. I‚Äôm almost to the point where I hate my life (and it doesn‚Äôt help I‚Äôm still in love with her mom, that‚Äôs another story), but really what are my options? Suicide? Walking out on my daughter? Those aren‚Äôt options. Everyday is long and exhausting. So while you didn‚Äôt ask for my life story, I can safely say from experience, what you‚Äôre jealous of is nothing I‚Äôd wish for anyone.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Where do you get Child Labor became way less intensive?

Child Labor before factories consisted of mostly farm work or husbandry on their families farms as found by Ann Kussmaul.

While farm work was hard, it was no where near factory work for a child in my opinion.

Kids as young as 4 years old worked long intensive hours, E. P. Thompson described factories as being ""places of sexual license, foul language, cruelty, violent accidents and alien manners.""

The entire factory system was criticized heavily for:

strict discipline, harsh punishment, unhealthy working conditions, low wages, inflexible work hours, depersonalizing the employer to employee relationship, stripping freedoms, dignity and creativity, taking children from orphanages and in exchange for food and housing, they worked them for long hours.

in fact, the last part was so rampant that 1/3 of all workers in mills where unpaid orphans, far under the age of 18, and got as high as 80% to 90% in certain mills.

However, once the steam engine was created, mills didn't have to rely on unpaid children as much but still hired similar amounts as low-paid workers.

While you may think that factories weren't as bad as farms, in my opinion they proved to be much MUCH more hurtful than working on a family farm or as a ranch hand.

&amp;#x200B;

if you would like to read up on the conditions for children during the British Industrial Revolution, I find this to be a good source and I quote it once or twice in my write-up.

After I graduated from law school in 2008,  I was making large extra payments because I was originally on two 2-year appointments with the Government and thought that I would go private once the economy improved.  Also, I was naive and thought that investing money was too risky due to the recent downturn.  When I saw my parents lose 40 percent of their savings in 2007 to 2008, I figured that paying down my loan balance was a safe use of my extra money.

It was only after 6 years or so with the Government that I gave up on going private because I was making a decent salary while working at home 4 days a week.   I saw that, in the private sector, lawyers could make about double, but they work three times as hard and have half the job security.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","&gt; So it's your turn. In what ways has FCA's actions spoken for themselves and proven the organization to be anti-lgbt? 

None I know of.  I'm sure there's cases of anti-gay behavior, denial of service, and other aspects but I've never cared to follow it and have no desire to start.  I'm not even going to state that the above behavior is due to FCA but instead just MS &amp; HS &amp; college kids being MS &amp; HS &amp; college kids.

Other than ""irrelevant statements of faith"" which are so relevant as to condemn homosexuality and require leaders and sometimes members to sign?  Either the words have meaning to the organization or they don't.  Since they're clearly anti-LGBT and anti-inclusion, they must mean something otherwise they would remove them.

You can't say they're not anti-LGBT when they actively maintain and require the signature of these documents, which they could stop doing at any time.  That members and chapters choose to ignore it doesn't mean that the parent organization isn't anti-LGBT, it means the people involved are better people than the organization.

&gt;they'll likely insist on keeping it because doing otherwise would be admitting you're wrong.

You mean admitting I'm right?

Wait, so these self-righteous assholes care so much about not being wrong that they continue to promote an anti-LGBT and anti-equality stance?  That isn't a good argument that its not meaningful to them at all because if that's the case, wouldn't it often be similar religious zealots who join the organization and who rise in leadership spreading those values?",1559347357

In fact, during my first time I thought the backrooms were just yet another one of my hallucinations, but I realized they were far too consistent to be a product of my mind. While I have plenty of experience getting in, I can't really tell you how to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

But I have a pet theory - if you believe in something you're about to do, it's more likely to happen. Try focusing all of your feelings into escaping, but not in a desperate, panicked way - meditate about getting out, if you will, and start walking. Avoid any dark walls and do not investigate any noises you may hear, hopefully you'll clip back to reality and in a safe place. I understand the implications of noclipping while falling...and not to bring you down, but staying in the backrooms is worse than dying.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. I'm amazed you're still around, people usually get to level 1 after they spend a few hours in level 0 (where you arrive at the backrooms). Maybe this is me being a little too optimistic, but you may have something helping you out, man.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Congratulations on recovery. I used to drive taxis, and talked with a lot of addicts (they're really good taxi customers here actually). So I have some slight insight (but never been part of it). 

One of them told me that ""you're never clean once addicted, you just keep extending the time between the times you use. And the goal is to get that time to last for however long you and the ones around you want it to. So surround yourself with people that are not afraid to say 'now's not the time, wait longer'"". He basically just had the opinion that he could relapse, he would never consider himself ""clean"", as that would then mean he could easily just think ""I'll just do it one more time"". I don't know how that sounds to someone that has had or might still have substance issues, but to me it sounds like a solid rule.

Sad thing is also that a lot of addicts don't get help when they seek it. And that's the point where we should all stand there with open arms. Instead they often get the message ""sorry, we don't have time/capacity atm"". 

It was also a recovering theme that most of them recognized they were the problem, that they sought out an escape from an otherwise bad life. As you said ""it feels great"". I'd like to think most people realize that those gratifications aren't a solid foundation though, and that might be why most people don't do drugs. It's hard work getting your life together if you've been dealt a hard hand. Be it medically, socially or other factors like abuse. 

More people would probably take the instant gratification route if they had the option of such without ramifications. Which is also why it should be discussed more openly and without prejudice, so the negatives (as you've experienced as well) are clear. Not as fear mongering, but just objectively so people can weigh the good with the bad, and reason their way to an answer of ""why don't we all just do them?"".",1559347361

The health side of things wasn't a problem for those days, but it never has been as I've been overweight and lazy for as long as I can remember.  If I'm really doing it for health, I would also start exercising more and eating healthier.  Both of my parents were health nuts so I know how to do it, but I'm still ordering grubhub constantly and sitting on my ass all day, so its not like thats changed.  (Now that I think about it I probably spend more on grubhub than weed....)

Why is it so hard to be honest with myself?  Thanks for making me take a deeper look.  I need think on this more.

Title: **Does font type on contracts matter?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I had a lawyer write up a client services contract for me. Does it matter what the font is as long as it's readable? Type and size? I want to use Century Gothic, if possible. I just think it's a clean font to read and a little more modern.

Their reasoning for using ""folx"" is that it's explicitly inclusive of non-binary people rather than implicitly inclusive like ""folks"" supposedly is. Personally I disagree with that though and think that using it just serves to turn ""folks"" from an already explicitly inclusive term into an implicitly exclusive word because people may see using ""folks"" as less inclusive and thus a word used by people that don't want to include non-binary people. As mentioned I think ""folks"" is already explicitly inclusive. ""Folks"" in this case is synonymous with ""people"" so if it's not explicitly including non-binary people to me that implies that it's up for debate whether they're people or not which is of course ridiculous and wrong.

"TheOA","t5_37af3","Yeah I don't think the show is exclusively gnostic, though there are ton of seemingly gnostic themes throughout.  But it definitely looks like they are drawing from a broad array of influences, as you say, esoteric/mystical/occult in particular.  The show's creators said it is not meant to be *specifically religious*, which points me more in the direction of occult and esotericism rather than the more biblical interpretations that keep cropping up. The sheer amount of theories people have about this show, really goes to show how much they could be drawing from.

Before you post anything on our comments here - first give my longer post a read, which goes into much more detail breaking down the gnostic themes in the show.  I have linked up in that post a lot of the other reddit threads which are pursuing a similar angle, I think you may enjoy reading them all and the discussions within each one.

Is this a Neo-Gnostic Tale? Does the OA represent the Fall of Sophia?:
https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOA/comments/b95kcl/is_this_a_neognostic_tale_does_the_oa_represent/

In terms of reddit etiquette, they usually say to search keywords or themes and make sure someone hasn't already posted something with the exact topic/discussion you want to start. 

There are a lot of posts already theorizing about the OA / 'away' sound, which are alternative to the 'Original Angel' theory.  Some good discussions of that you will find within some of the other OA gnostic posts. 

You mention Plato - so there are connections to Plato and gnosticism, apparently gnosticism was in fact influenced by 'middle platonism'. And Plato's Cave allegory is also well loved by many gnostics.

There are some other points you bring up, which I can't answer to. I'm not on board yet with the Steve being her brother idea, more of the show has to play out for me to get that angle.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I do recruiting for a staffing agency.  As a contractor, you work and perform the same tasks as a company employee, but you are considered an employee for the agency.  They take care of the payroll, the insurance, worker's comp, benefits, etc.  

You want to check the terms of the contract.  Is it a contract, or contract-to-hire?  Contract usually has a set end date, maybe 90-days or 6-months.  These types of contracts can be extended, but that's never guaranteed.  A contract-to-hire is more of an open ended contract where you start with the company and after a while, you may be converted to a full-time employee (this is when you are a bonafide employee of the company and not the agency).  This is never guaranteed.  You may work for a company as a contractor for years and not get converted, or possibly be laid off.  

You can quit even if the contract isn't up (if it is indeed a set-date contract), but make sure you leave the right way.  Don't burn any bridges.  

Your salary is only locked in when you accept your offer.  If after your interview, you get an offer that you don't think is adequate, you can ask your recruiter to see if the company is willing to offer you more.  If they can, great!  If not, decide if the job is what you want for that rate.  After you accept and sign the offer letter, it is a really bad look to try and ask for more money.  It is unlikely to get reimbursements for you traveling to the interview site.

We have a bit more than that. The modern global instrumentation record goes back to 1880,

* https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/history/

though region records such as Central England go back all the way to the 17th century.

I also find it a bit funny that you say we know nearly nothing about paleoclimate in one breath and then in the next point to a well documented paleoclimate event. Lol. ;)

&gt;1 degree C in 100 years. So scary the sky is falling.

A one degree change to global temperature isn't peanuts and has little to due with a one degree change in temperature in your backyard. Such a global change represents a tremendous amount of heat energy being retained in the atmosphere and oceans.

&gt;Nevermind humans in northern Europe dealt with 10 degree C warming in less than 50 years at the end of the younger dryas

Just because climate change is not going to cause human extinction (which I've seen some foolish folk claim) that doesn't mean it won't have dire consequences and have costs which can be counted in human lives. The exacerbation of the Syrian civil war due to the prolonged drought and the case rate of dengue fever in Southeast Asia due to mosquito populations are two such examples.

* https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/WCAS-D-13-00059.1  
* http://www.precaution.org/lib/05/warming_harms_health.051117.pdf

&gt;but speaking that amount of time when is the next ice age due?

Approximately 1,500 years. Though I don't believe the next one will behave like a normal ice age considering our sky-high CO2 concentration which won't naturally be depleted for quite some time.

* https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1358

But I'm not sure what you're getting at. Yes the climate will change, in fact it will change dramatically on its own without humans, but humanity is (a) forcing very quick changes without yet understanding the consequences, (b) forcing consequences on people who didn't burn all that fossil fuel,  and (c) doing so at a pace far exceeding most natural changes.

First was just sorta... meh. 2.5/3 stars, at most. I really liked **Before She Was Found,** though. I didn‚Äôt figure out the ending until about 3/4th of the way through. Good stuff. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll read next. Recs from what I have would be very much appreciated. 

I picked up two YA anthologies, **Rags &amp; Bones** and **Geektastic**. But I usually save my anthologies for throughout the week, when I don‚Äôt have time to sit and devour a good, long book. I also grabbed **Providence** by Caroline Kepnes, which isn‚Äôt YA, **The Devouring Gray** by Christine Lynn Herman and **Dig** by A. S. King. Oh, and I still have **Wicked Saints** by Emily A.

You could also try taking on a bit more risk and finding some small-cap stocks that sound interesting and buying three $500 parcels of them. This is a lot riskier though and the chances of you losing a lot of your money are greater than purchasing an ETF.

At the age of 14, you have a long time to remake any money you lose, so you will see some people here advise to take on more risk because there is also mpre potential for high growth. Someone nearing retirement would normally take on less riskier investments because if they go bad then they cannot re-enter the workforce.

I would advise with any investment you make at this age to be patient and possibly not even track the share price daily.

Animals dont have concepts of gender like that and it feels insulting to compare calling an animal ‚Äúthey‚Äù or something is anywhere near the actual trans experience. Even if thats not their intention, thats how it comes off to me. Honestly like, what pronouns you use for your pet doesnt matter and i wouldnt be offended if someone said to call their pet by different pronouns, but saying things like ‚Äúmy bunny is genderfluid‚Äù just feels like theyre making fun of genderfluid people or turning our struggles into a fun game for themselves. 

I actually have a friend who has a male bunny with a feminine name and we call her by she/her pronouns. I dont find that too weird because this person is also trans and they actually thought the bunny was female until they took her to the vet.  The difference here, imo, is that this person obvs DOES understand what its like to be trans and doesnt claim the bunny is literally trans.

BUT

Alabama doesn't kill prisoners by beheading them and parading their crucified body around public. Missouri doesn't throw women in jail for talking with tourists. Georgia doesn't stone folk for having the audacity to speak out against the government. 

What's happening here in the states isn't even in the same league as what's going on in the KSA. Some people might say well that's their culture or that's just their religion and I just don't buy that. There is something fundamentally wrong that goes beyond religion and culture. I mean if people wanna boycott shows in these states here, more power to them. Heck I'd be down for that, but what's happening over there is just not the same as what's happening here.

I forget about him after calling his phone a few times and getting no answer.

A few hours go by and he shows back up but he has a black eye and swollen jaw/face. He has no idea what happened.

So, uh, if anyone punched my cousin in the face please let me know what he did lol. He thinks he was trying to talk to a lady (that was obviously taken and with her bf at the time). We always joke about this story and Parasols.

This is hands down the best climate plan released by any Canadian party for the upcoming federal election. It's just all around good policy. Highly recommend everyone give it a read.

EDIT: Since it's so comprehensive here are the main points.

\- funding for public transit

\- increased EV rebates

\- banning single use plastic by 2022

\- building retrofit grants

\- ensuring new buildings and the grid is emissions-free by 2030

\- replacing the rural bus routes that Greyhound gave up

\- national cycling strategy",1559347378

At America and Boca, Benedetto was surrounded by some of the best playmakers in the league. He won't have that luxury at San Jose.

What will they do, do you think?  Find the goodness in their heart to invest in education and birth control more?   That's been been working so well in Africa...

The poor will never go away, not even when we are exploring the stars.  Eventually they'll just kill a ton of people to reduce consumption, because they won't think they have a choice.

"RealTesla","t5_3mgxy","Just like every other semi important strategic decision and ‚Äúmajor reveal‚Äù Tesla has had to make recently, it was poorly thought through and poorly communicated. 

Tesla makes the same unforced errors over &amp; over again.  They are horrible at mid-long term planning and execution.  Car manufacturing is hard and requires disciplined management.  Tesla has no discipline and it starts at the top. 

EM is a top down, moody, micro manager and does not treat his employees well.  This creates a very dysfunctional culture. Their talent acquisition and retention is really piss poor, they lose droves of good employees in an insanely tight job market. 

The pricing decision in the country that was responsible for 56% of all 2018 plug in EV sales and yoy growth is a pretty big deal. Especially with the factory being built over there.  

Obviously Tesla was afraid to put out a price too low, that would literally stop China sales for however long it takes Tesla to start producing cars. 6-10 months, doubt it.   Stupid as Hell not to have though about  that, very obvious. 

But the real question is why say anything at all about pricing for a car that won‚Äôt be widely available for another year??  Why put out a deadline for mass producing cars in China by March 2020 (10 months) when you don‚Äôt have to?

Musk simply cannot help himself, can‚Äôt keep his mouth shut.  He‚Äôs been pumping at a dizzying pace..$420 buy out, disappointing Y reveal, impossible 2019 guidance reconfirmed over &amp; over again, this is the year of Energy, equity &amp; debt raise credibility hit, 10,000 cars a week...then the most ludicrous Robo taxis &amp; AI..tell the world you are pivoting the companies entire strategy &amp; putting 100% of resources behind Robo taxis. Wtf.  

There are 100 EV manufacturers in China, nationalism and tariffs are on the rise and Tesla desperately needs hundreds of thousands of cars produced and sold in China every year.  

Very bad start.

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","Look at it from the perspective of a new/newer player though.

In order to get the content this game has to offer, a new player either needs to:

A) Pay $93 for the base game and every character.

B) Grind up the Shards to unlock each character individually (9k per killer). As a more casual player myself I earn 2k a week, so over a month between each killer. Keep in mind that you then need to grind that killer up in order to get their perks, since you can't spend Shards on Perks without setting your Killer Progress back.

Doing this means that it would take you a year to unlock every *killer* in the roster, nevermind the four that come out a year and any survivors you wanted.

C) Some combination of the two which could easily combine the expense of the one with the tedium of the other.

That's not going into how if you like a Killer but hate their default skin (Legion for me), you'd have to pay shards to get Devil-May-Care Joe or whatever other skin.

And **that's** not going into how a ton of killers are incredibly weak without certain perks. You'd have to grind up the shards to get Hag for Hex: Ruin, Spirit for Spirit Fury, and Leatherface for BBQ and Chili if you wanted the most basic of Meta builds; you're looking at nearly four months before you can even *start* putting the build together.

Keep in mind that certain Killers also need certain corner case perks as well; Myers wants Bamboozle so you need Clown, Trapper wants Fire Up so you should get Freddy, and a couple of other corner cases like that.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Can you elaborate? The Second Amendment, prior to *Heller* in 2008, had zero favorable SCOTUS cases. Today, it is legally established that there is an individual right to bear arms in the home, and that this applies against state and federal governments. 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th amendments all each have better established scope than that. 1st and 4th have jurisprudential histories that dwarf that of the second amendment. The commerce clause has better jurisprudential development. The second amendment, until 11 years ago, did not have a single favorable SCOTUS ruling - all other gun related cases that ended favorably, e.g. Lopez, Haynes, were decided on other grounds. Where does the number ""sixty"" come from?

Justice Thomas has complained, always in dissent, of the inability to grant certiorari in second amendment cases. See [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-704\_jiel.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-704_jiel.pdf) What is your rebuttal to his position?

I can't name a single place, circumstance, or person where it is possible to carry a gun that it is not also possible to voice a political opinion.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Obama expanded and laid the groundwork to legalize all the evil programs that came out of the Bush admin spying on us.

He pulled out of Iraq before the country was stabilized and sent us back in 2014, we are still there. He basically fucked up the Middle-East even more than Bush did.

Congress wouldn't work with him so he abused and expanded the executive branch's powers to legislate without congress. He massively expanded the drone program and is responsible for thousands of innocent people's deaths including the bombing of a hospital. He made it far easier to put innocent people on their terrorist kill list for something as simple as an unverified tweet. 

There's emails of him sucking up to Citibank executives before he was elected and mysteriously no one got prosecuted for 2008. He prosecuted more whistleblowers than any president in history under the espionage act.

"JamesBond","t5_2rsg9","It's wonderful to see a feminist writer who can make these sorts of distinctions. If that sounds patronising, look at how heavy-handed so much feminist art/media tends to be: even the really accomplished stuff tends to blurt out buzzwords and themes rather than allowing them to naturally emerge as part of the narrative. Most potently, look at Killing Eve's first and second seasons. The feminist undertones in the first season are clear, but not overtly vocalised. As in Fleabag, PWB (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) has a light touch in making her politics part of the series' world and its characters, rather than having to state it outright. S2 of Killing Eve, on the other hand, has slipped too often into clich√© and caricature (particularly Julian from episode 2 as a stereotypical predatory 'nice guy' loner) both in its writing and its politics.

I've been onboard with PWB being part of Bond from the beginning, and this quote reinforces my confidence in her. Bond is a sexist character: he uses women either to get what he needs for a mission, or for short-term pleasure. It's implicit in the films and explicit in the books that this is down to his knowledge that he could die at any moment, so indulges himself while he can. In the books, Bond is generally more complex. He's a failed romantic, who has desires for a long-term romantic relationship with a woman but can never make it work due to his addiction to thrills and danger. The last lines Fleming wrote encapsulate this inner tragedy: 'He said it and meant it, ‚ÄúGoodnight. You‚Äôre an angel.‚Äù At the same time, he knew, deep down, that love from Mary Goodnight, or from any other woman, was not enough for him. It would be like taking ‚Äúa room with a view‚Äù. For James Bond, the same view would always pall.' It's why Teresa's murder completely devastates him: he'd found the one person whose pain he could relate to and who would always excite him, and she is snatched away from him, as a consequence of his job (Blofeld/Irma getting revenge), almost immediately following their marriage. It's a complexity which has somewhat regrettably never made it to the films, although the film character's relative simplicity is arguably a big part of what has made him so adaptable to changing times.

That PWB recognises that sexism is part of Bond's nature but need not extend to diminishing the movies' female characters is a distinction few have been able to make. Bond women have always been given less credit than they deserve due to the enduring stereotype of them all being brainless bimbos, where in fact all the favourites have either played a key role in the plot/had a storyline of their own, or at least been somewhat self-sufficient and with more character than the average action movie love interest. If PWB can give Bond 25's female characters a depth, complexity and active role in the plot, without trying to make Bond 'woke' or constantly put down for the nature of his character, it'll only make for a better, more interesting film that continues a long tradition of rich and memorable Bond women.",1559347386

I try to explain to them with awkward analogies that with complete mastery of genes, its like looking down on your kid for making a custom toy out of lego, the individual blocks don't necessarily become ""wrong"" or worse when altered in some way outside of the original ""blueprint"". Nature and evolution didn't always find the most sensible path for every gene in every species. Sometimes, some things can be improved, at least in regards to what we require from them.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Afastado do cargo ap√≥s [interfer√™ncia do governo na divulga√ß√£o de um comercial do Banco do Brasil](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/04/presidente-do-bb-atende-bolsonaro-demite-diretor-e-tira-do-ar-comercial-com-jovens-descolados.shtml) sobre diversidade, Delano Valentim de Andrade renunciou oficialmente nesta sexta-feira (31).

 A sa√≠da n√£o envolve, por√©m, o fim do v√≠nculo com o banco p√∫blico. Ele ser√° vice-presidente do argentino Banco Patag√¥nia, controlado pelo BB.

 Andrade era diretor de Marketing e Comunica√ß√£o do Banco do Brasil, mas foi afastado do posto ap√≥s a interfer√™ncia do presidente Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) na divulga√ß√£o de um v√≠deo em que apareciam jovens descolados. Eram retratados negros, gays e havia uma transexual no v√≠deo.

 O comercial foi considerado inapropriado pelo presidente, que pediu a retirada da campanha do ar. A ordem foi acatada por Rubem Novaes, presidente do BB, ainda em abril.

 ‚ÄãDesde que Novaes assumiu o comando do Banco do Brasil, delegou √†s suas equipes de marketing e de tecnologia um plano para atrair jovens com uma linguagem mais moderna e com servi√ßos via internet capazes de competir com as fintechs, hoje uma amea√ßa concreta aos maiores bancos e que t√™m entre os jovens seus maiores adeptos.

 Em entrevista a jornalistas, no come√ßo do m√™s, Novaes afirmou que [recebeu o v√≠deo de ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/05/comercial-tinha-muita-juventude-descolada-diz-banco-do-brasil.shtml)[Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/05/comercial-tinha-muita-juventude-descolada-diz-banco-do-brasil.shtml) e que tampouco gostou do que viu.

 ‚ÄúN√£o gostei por uma raz√£o muito simples: nosso objetivo √© atingir todo o espectro de jovens, que n√£o vi representado‚Äù, afirmou √† √©poca.

 ‚ÄúN√£o vi o jovem fazendeiro, o rapaz esportista, o nerd. N√£o vi ali o jovem de classe m√©dia baixa que rala um dia inteiro para pagar estudos √† noite. Ficou muito concentrado na juventude descolada‚Äù, criticou tamb√©m √† √©poca.

"onebag","t5_301sk","I have both bags and have carried both bags all over the world (on many, many trips), plus done 2 challenges, run a half marathon, and more with my GR1. I've done a lot of cool shit with my CPL24 by my side, but less as an implement in the cool shit- more of a supporting role.

Respectfully, I think your mentioned concerns are internet tiddly-wink bullshit ;). My GR1 has never damaged my clothes. I have worn it with merino wool, as well as other fabrics. And my CPL24 gets as dirty as my GR1. I either don't care about that, or I clean it off.

[Here is my CPL24, today](https://imgur.com/a/EElJnt7). I have carried it almost every day for the last 18 months.

As for durability, I think the GR1 *might, might* be a bit more durable. But both are ""crazy"" durable bags.

My GR1 was my EDC and my ""one bag"" travel bag for years. But now my CPL24 has replaced it and my GR1 is primarily an adventure bag for me.

**If I had to pick just one, I would pick based on style and ergonomics.** The GR1 is a great ruck, but the outer slash pocket bothered me (hard to access when the main compartment is full) and the bag is very tactical (or tacticool). Once, I dug that. Now I want to be a bit under-the-radar.

The CPL24 is technically a smaller bag, but just as useful for me, and the ergonomics are better- most/all pockets are easy to access, even when the bag is stuffed. The larger inside mesh pocket zipper is very thoughtfully side-zippered. The key hook inside the outside pocket is useful. The side handle is useful. And the look is more to my liking these days.

Plus, I dig supporting small and cool brands. GoRuck is small and cool. Evergoods is smaller and cool.

Either way, you can't make a wrong choice- both are awesome bags and awesome companies.

Good luck, and reply if I can make any specific comparisons for you.",1559347387

Republican voters can be uninformed. Democratic voters can be uninformed. I know plenty on either side. What I do know, however, is that the GOP media apparatus is entirely focused on actively misinforming as many people as they can. I don't believe that the problem is the uninformed populace. I believe that misinformation, not a lack of information, or lack of access to information is the key problem that we are dealing with right now.

Nor do I believe that it is remotely responsible for us to be recommending that anyone should abdicate their civic responsibilities for any reason. If someone is informed enough to know that they are too uninformed to make a responsible decision at the polls, that's one thing. But at the very least, automatic voter registration and same-day registration should be the law of the land full stop.

To argue in favor for systems that prevent or outright discard the votes of someone who *wants* to vote, but is unable to due to legislative fuckery is entirely undemocratic.  


Regardless of whether it would make my vote count for less, or whether it would result in unfavorable outcomes to policies I support, I believe that it is important for voters to be able to elect their representatives in a way that is easy to count, easy to confirm, and easy to access.",1559347388

Personally I have been a Cincinnati Zoo member for the last decade and am also glad they do memberships. It is a good value for our family.  I just don‚Äôt think the tax structure and membership fee is fair when you compare the deal my family gets to someone struggling to pay regular admission price and  also their taxes.

Next time you are at the zoo note the demographics of those in attendance.  The majority appear to be upper middle class.  I still maintain it is structured as a regressive tax, but it‚Äôs good to know there is reduced admission for those eligible for SNAP.

To answer your question, I have never been to the free zoo in DC but I have been to the excellent free St. Louis zoo and have noted the demographics is a better representation of their city.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Okay, then let the Feral druid heal while simultaneously doing damage. Give them two separate global cooldowns, one for damage and one for healing. Or give them something like the Nature's Vigil talent in MoP, except it's just up permanently - 30% of your damage cleaves as healing, 30% of your healing cleaves as damage.

The whole point about the Feral is that it enters cat form and can't heal while it's in cat form. If you're going to make the ""bUt HeAlInG"" argument then let them do both at the same time. Or strip all defensives away from pure DPS classes like Rogues and Mages. Get rid of Vanish, Ice Block, and Evasion. Those are stepping on the toes of tanks, after all.

A Paladin is more of a jack of all trades than a Druid is, because Druids can't do everything at once, not really. There's a difference between being ""jack of all trades, master of none"" and ""jack of all trades, loser at everything"". Vanilla wow hybrids are the latter.",1559347391

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;&gt; ... an emotionally driven choice

I agree and what most folks refuse to acknowledge is that they behave this way. They think that only their ‚Äúpolitical opponents‚Äù do so.

You might be familiar with (or interested in) [this study](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Analyses+of+Social+Issues+and+Public+Policy+Florette+Cohen&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3DkGvC86W6LEgJ).

What the study (which has been repeated similarly since, hundreds of times in various countries) demonstrates is that; merely considering an emotional state prior to voting, can change the voters choice.

Or, [as a friend of mine wrote in a sermon, citing the study](http://www.rickhoyt.com/RickHoyt/Sermons/Entries/2010/1/24_The_Limits_of_Reason.html), we truly *are* ruled by our *passions*. We just don‚Äôt like to believe we are so.

But with the 9/11 and 9/12 you can really feel that whole 9% of THC and it punches way above the numbers, and I challenge you to not be a grinning fool. But feel comfortable about it.

Lately we've mostly been getting 8/12 Y&amp;Y from OCS; not at all the same as 9/11 or 9/12, much closer in effects to a stronger and longer-lasting WeedMD Mango Haze, without the taste usually.

The 9/12 even  looks more like the 9/11 i.e. much more orange than the very green 8/12, which is more similar-looking to MH. Not that we can buy anything on the looks of the actual product we're receiving...

I used to use niacinamide a lot and experienced good results with that too, but for some reason it slipped out of my routine. I just discovered the bottle again so I think I'm gonna start using it again, it worked really well in the past.

Also, being put on BC 2 years ago helped my skin a lot! I'm on a progesterone only pill (so no breaks) and I've loved it. However, it's definitely very difficult to find the right one, the first one I tried worked perfectly and I've never had to change but my best friend couldn't take my one and went through about 5 different ones before she found one she's happy with. It's definitely trial and error, and patience!

Sometimes I get downvoted for saying something good about the Rift S, other times I get downvoted for saying something bad about the Rift S.

The real conclusion is that you can't please everyone and people will voice their opinion and downvote when they disagree with you but don't say a word when they agree.

\---

This is what I fucking mean. I mentioned Rift S and mentioned something bad, boom downvote. Now for fucking what then? Come with an argument!

Last time I said to people in the VRChat subreddit that the Rift S is decent and not actually a spawn straight from hell with tracking that literally never works I got downvoted to the bottom of the page, somewhere else I mention that skimping on IPD adjustment was a bad decision and I got downvoted as well since the Rift S is literally perfect.

Now what is it? Is it a hellspawn or literally perfect?",1559347393

There was climate change 12k years ago that is far more significant impacts to the average temperature in way shorter of a time, 10c in less than 10 years. That led to the Quarternary Extinction Event and the end of the ice age. Humans survived barely survived that and it was 10x worse.

 We are terrible polluters and making things worse and harder on ourselves to be sure, but the ""we're going extinct"" alarmism is highly exaggerated. ""We're going to have to grow the fuck up and steward our planet better"" is probably more accurate. I think we're more likely to go extinct from nukes or killer robots than climate change.

"fivenightsatfreddys","t5_331ct","If the games only had the ‚Äúsimple parts‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think HW would imply that Parasol Games is a company in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù, where a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Freddy Fazbear‚Äôs Pizza exists (ex: the real world pictures on the TV screen), and I don‚Äôt think the game would reference a real man we know, and the games he made and released ‚Äúover several years‚Äù if it was also trying to tell us those games he made weren‚Äôt the games we played. I think if it were trying to separate the ‚Äúin game games‚Äù from our games, it‚Äôd at least imply that these ‚Äúgames‚Äù weren‚Äôt made by Scott, and wouldn‚Äôt bridge the gap between game and real world. As it stands, tape 13 is trying to tell us that it‚Äôs talking about Scott Cawthon, and as the beginning of the game suggests with screenshots from his game, it‚Äôs also talking about the FNaF games.

So the idea that the games the indie dev made weren‚Äôt the actual games we played, and he‚Äôs in the ‚ÄúFNaF universe‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work too well when the game seems like it‚Äôs trying to tell us that Fazbear Entertainment is now a real company who made their own game based off these games. Otherwise it creates a big inception where in the main FNaF universe, someone made a game based off actual events, but that game happens to be very similar to the game that we actually played. Even Easter eggs included, since there‚Äôs an ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me‚Äù Easter egg at Foxy‚Äôs cove in the FNaF1 portion. It sounds easier if the HW games are legitimately based off the actual FNaF games.

Edit: And to add, it also doesn‚Äôt work, because if the games referred to in HW weren‚Äôt like the actual games _we_ played, then their premise wouldn‚Äôt still be the same. In the HW minigames, which are based off the stories made by the indie developer, the phone calls with exposition are still there, some (it seems like) Easter eggs of FNaF1 at least are still there, Springtrap is still there, etc. All these things are still here, so how exactly do we know what isn‚Äôt accurate to the actual events?",1559347396

Blackford is one of the many coastal trade cities for the North and East mainland. Unlike a lot of other cities in the realm Blackford does not have a slum district within the city walls - instead the lower class have developed a strong community outside of the city centred around an ancient ring of stones. It's not very defended but the cities Lord Protector saw it fit to extend the city trench around the district and build a palisade around the outer edge. The denizens of the slum district have been allowed their own farms and livestock, as long as they continue to work the lands and docks for their pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Boasting one of the larger and more populated Guild Districts this is one of the few cities where the Archeology Guild operate - studying the strata of the earth and collecting artifacts around the known world to be placed in a grand museum.

The city also have a thriving Dock and Trade District that is one of the most well connected in the known world, given its position to trade with many of the southern ports, western ports and good lands routes with the other major cities.

&amp;#x200B;

The manor house of the Lord Protector of Blackford has an ancient stone circle in the grounds, much to the annoyance of the Guilds all access for study has been denied with only a few parchments of etchings existing for study.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Ao menos 11 pessoas morreram em um ataque a tiros em um complexo da prefeitura de Virginia Beach, no estado americano da Virg√≠nia, nesta sexta-feira (31), informaram as autoridades locais.

 O chefe da pol√≠cia, James Cervera, disse que o atirador abriu fogo indiscriminadamente contra funcion√°rios dentro de um dos pr√©dios. 

 A pol√≠cia disparou de volta, matando o suspeito, que era um antigo funcion√°rio do departamento de obras p√∫blicas, acrescentou Cervera. A identidade do suposto atirador n√£o foi revelada. Cervera o descreveu como ""descontente"".

 Um dos seis feridos √© um policial. 

 ""Este √© o dia mais devastador da hist√≥ria de Virginia Beach"", disse o prefeito Robert M. Dyer.

 O governador Ralph Northam afirmou em uma rede social que est√° ""monitorando a situa√ß√£o"" e pediu que a popula√ß√£o ""siga todas as instru√ß√µes dos agentes da lei"".

  

O ataque ocorreu no Edif√≠cio n¬∫ 2 do Centro Municipal Virginia Beach, um complexo de escrit√≥rios e ag√™ncias municipais, incluindo o Departamento de Pol√≠cia. No Edif√≠cio n¬∫ 2 ficam os departamentos de planejamento e de obras p√∫blicas. 

 O ataque come√ßou por volta das 17h locais (18h de Bras√≠lia). Uma testemunha disse a uma afiliada do canal de TV NBC que os funcion√°rios estavam trabalhando quando come√ßaram a ouvir os tiros. 

 Uma funcion√°ria do departamento de obras p√∫blicas identificada como Megan Banton disse ao canal Channel 13 NewsNow que ela e cerca de 20 colegas fizeram uma barricada nos escrit√≥rios com mesas. Ela disse que eles podiam ouvir os tiros e os policiais gritando ""abaixem-se"". 

 Cinco pessoas foram enviadas para o Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital, segundo o jornal The Washington Post.

 ""As v√≠timas s√£o amigos e vizinhos"", afirmou o vereador Michael Berlucchi, segundo o Post. ""E pessoas que servem √† popula√ß√£o de Virginia Beach. Essa √© uma trag√©dia horr√≠vel, sem sentido.""",1559347396

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","The thing is, post graduation we‚Äôre working two jobs just to afford where we live and many don‚Äôt have time to date.

Studying cross cultural psychology you‚Äôll find that sex *is almost entirely* cultural, and if people don‚Äôt have social pressure to seek out long term mates they quite simply won‚Äôt until it‚Äôs too late. Some cultures you don‚Äôt have to and so people don‚Äôt at all. So we have a choice:

Do we want to live in a monogamous society or not?

If there‚Äôs no pressure to be monogamous there‚Äôs no pressure to date until, for many in our generation at least, it‚Äôs too late.

HOWEVER, I‚Äôve noticed huge class and culture disparities in what the OP said. Private college campuses usually have tons of upper class women, who have a much larger time frame to find a husband if they decide to because they have a social safety net if they spend their whole time in college drinking and fucking. 

Lower class women, in my experience, tend to have much more motivation to find a man before they have to start working their whole life. Many Latinas I‚Äôve found are culturally raised to be this way as well.",1559347399

My best friend wanted so badly to date in high school and let her experience be ruined by the fact that she didn‚Äôt have a boyfriend.

"miamidolphins","t5_2s20n","This is the usual explanation, and it is reasonable, but I don't think it really explains what's happened. Whilst its true fullbacks like Czonka and Jim Brown were enormous in comparison to the defenders trying to stop them, there were plenty of capable fullbacks after them, right up to the 90s: Riggins, Rathman, Okoye (as you mentioned) even Keith Byars for us in the early 90s was solid, and they were generally playing against defenses geared to stopping the run. And there were guys like that in most teams. 

Its more that college football, with some exceptions, has turned away from using a fullback with all the spread formations and empty backfields, that consequently the position hasn't evolved. There are still fullbacks coming out of college, but none of them seem to have that x-factor, and more are simply blockers than guys who can carry the ball and do something special.

I mean, having a 6'7"", 330 fullback who can run a 4.5 would be amazing, but I don't think those numbers are a necessity. I still think a Riggins or a Czonka would be useful in today's league, though I don't think either would be particularly large comnpared to today's RBs, however that style of brute force running has a lot going for it, and the NFL is a poorer place without guys like that around anymore.",1559347405

Literally every event in my life that I've considered can just as easily be explained in a world with or without God.  I spent years looking for his movement and came up with zero.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was lowered recently. 
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)

@7 Not really. Hollywood was a latecomer to the international market, then dominated by France ... until the 1st WW, when French movie production came to an halt.

@8 ""The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited naturalization to ""free white persons""; it was expanded to include blacks in the 1860s and Asians only in the 1950s. This made the United States an outlier, since laws that made racial distinctions were uncommon in the world in the 18th Century.""

As for your other comment pointing out that there's very little on Quest that wasn't already available on other platforms, you might want to take a closer look at the GameBoy's launch lineup.

War, gun heavy game mechanics, combat heavy game mechanics, heavy military leanings, hot women that are often love interests or are in need of saving, big drivable vehicles, strong rugged male protagonists. They're selling boys and men on a fantasy they know will appeal to them.

Now notice how games such as Dragon Age who don't feature this heavily targeted subject material have much more of a cross demographics appeal?

The vet was right too, that they can decline very rapidly, before there's even time to figure out what's going on.

Compare yours to the pictures and moniture them very closely for colour, size and firmness.

Illegal aliens abuse the tax code at refund season by having their own tax Id numbers, as opposed to us citizens with SSNs, where they claim child tax credits that pays out a few billion a year in refunds;
Illegal aliens commit identity fraud, take blue collar jobs while dealing primarily in cash, off the books;
They overburden public defender offices' and create yearslong backlogs in federal immigrations courts...

Eventually Calvin will have to sever ties with CSW and exit, probably around early 2020 when he fails to move Satoshi's coins from the ""Tulip Trust"". Until then, he's still gotta get into profit, and I'd expect he will do everything in his power to make that happen.",1559347417

It doesn't do certain aspects of high fantasy very well, though that's probably its strongest area. Overall, 5e is a compromise system, which works for some people, doesn't work for others. It's simple and runs in broad strokes. But there's quite a large segment of gamers who are willing to put in some extra effort for the sake of extra precision. To simply dismiss extra precision as ""no benefit"" feels a tad demeaning to all those players.

And to be able to identify if a population has evolved enough to be a seperate species from another one, you have to use interfertility. All taxonomy is about usefulness, which isn't necessarily contradictory with having one built on evolutionary relationships since that's inherently linked to differences in important characteristics. Racial differences in a way also tell you about evolutionary relationships too. However, like I said, racial classification isn't arbitrary, their are objectively different genetic clusters amongst humans that can serve as a usefull way of identifying many differences.",1559347421
"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","&gt;Do you think it's of value for Trump to have a boogie man in the form of illegal immigrants?

I think he needs to focus on reducing legal immigration instead of complaining about illegals all the time but they do need to be deported. The Republican Party has used illegal immigration as a way of seeming tough on immigration while still allowing millions of people to pour into our country for too long. Illegal immigration is a problem. Legal immigration is a far more important one. Trump has been a let down on that as well but I hope he flip flops back to wanting to reduce legal immigration instead of this meritocratic bullshit.

&gt;Do you think Trump actually cares? If his convictions against illegals were so strong, why did he hire them?

Because it was cheaper. I don't know if he actually cares. I kind of doubt it. I hope he will do it to please us (his base) but I have no idea what's in his heart.",1559347421

Turns out it was indeed a man who killed her, however he has since proven to be a deranged drug abusive paranoid delusional, that is to say it seems more likely that he suffered from a psychotic episode, there also does not seem to be any evidence of sexual crime as the original narrative to men's exploitation or women and an inability to control their sexual desires the original unfounded narrative attempted to convey.

"sleep","t5_2qpyn","HI  OP  OK  WE got this scopped out for you here right now!
.


OP,  you experienced some very common events or ""states"" or ""modalities"" whatever,  while you were  sleeping!

.



Obviously, you experienced sleep paralysis -  SP is something we all experience each time we sleep!
.


SP is very normal to healthy sleep

and   our   sleeping brain produces  SP in order to protect each of us as we dream and maybe fight or thrash around while dreaming!


SP  or SleepParalysis is normal to all

sleep and is not a parasomina, as I discuss next!


.


OK, so most of us - probably all of us- 

participate in and experience Parasomnias from time to time while sleeping!

.

Parasomnia is really two words in one and it's  Para meaning ""along side""  and Somninia  meaning  ""sleep""

.

So parasomnia(s) are events that evolve and go along  with our good sleep!

.

Some  consider all parasomnias as bad or pathological aspects of sleep - 
maybe ,  but some parasomnias are a lot more commonly reported and basically benign,   than others!

.

Op, talks about at least two  different  parasomnias - e.g., having ""nightmares in sleep""  , having very troubling ""hypnogogic hallucinations of sleep""  


.

OP woke up from sleep/sleep paralysis and could not move and next experienced  hallucinations incident to normal sleep  - 

.
these were dreams of being awake but paralysed -  

.

""hallucinations incident to sleep""

.

This  all sounds  scary and maybe is  but harmless and really are a part of normal everyday sleep -  IRL,  as it is maybe  were!


.
.


Enjoy,  OP!


.

Great Sleep;Good Luck!

You're a sorlock with the versatility to be almost anything needed at any moment.  You can play in melee or at range, pump out high damage, AoE damage, healing if needed, you have a chainlock familiar as scout+emergency healer+combat helper, you are party face, you are battlefield control (repelling blast is RIDICULOUS), etc.

I went Breastplate + Shield and flavored the build as an Arcane Spartan kind of character.  Eldritch Blast was momentary arcane weapons made out of magical energy.  So I threw spears, daggers, hammers etc. for ranged attacks, and got super creative with melee range Eldritch Blast combinations.  I've never had so much fun describing combat maneuvers.",1559347423

For the forge cleric I would suggest being  a hill dwarf, for the tempest probably Vuman, sea elf and water genasi could be interesting, but their utility will depend on the campaign and environment. If you use standard array or point but, most of your ASIs are probably best invested on increasing stats instead of feats. If you roll dices and get good results the feats are likely to become a better option.

 I will choose spell sniper, and get booming blade, with war caster for using it in opportunity attacks, for the tempest cleric, also depending on what weapon you choose, great weapon master, sentinel and possibly polearm master, though giving booming blade is probably better having a greatsword or a maul. If you are Vuman, you can have spell sniper at level 1. 

For the forge cleric I will probably take heavily armored, as reduces PBS non magical damage to an extent. Having the Warhammer, probably great weapon master.

"zoloft","t5_2x77y","**Reposting this from another thread**


 I‚Äôm a retired U.S. Marine with a history of combat-related PTSD, specifically, insomnia, hyper-vigilance and anxiety. I struggled mightily with this for 35 years; I‚Äôm 63 years old.

Long story made short: I finally went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed 50mg of Zoloft per day. When I picked up the prescription, the pharmacist, whom I know well, took me aside and told me that IF this drug was going to work for me, it would likely take 4-6 weeks for me to feel any positive impact. In the meantime, she said, my anxiety might actually get worse, and this did happen.

For the first few weeks, I literally had anxiety about taking an anxiety med. I was worried and praying at the same time that this drug would help me. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt myself, but the awareness that people on anxiety and depression meds often take their own lives was heightened in my mind. 

In short, I was worried that this drug would make me into a zombie, etc. This didn‚Äôt happen, not even close; I remained fully in control of myself at all times.

I toughed it out and at 4 weeks to the day, I suddenly realized that I actually felt pretty good. I felt better every day and at the 6-7 week point, I felt great...I mean really great! The anxiety and hyper-vigilance were gone, and I mean gone...after more than 3 decades. 

I finally slept well and every aspect of my life improved dramatically. I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for 2.5 years now, and have zero anxiety, hyper-vigilance and I sleep like a baby. I have no side-effects and I do not plan to ever stop taking this drug. I truly believe that it saved my life.

As my pharmacist said, you have to give the drug a chance to work, and it may take several weeks to start having positive effects. Think positive thoughts and keep your mind occupied by being with people, watching funny movies, being in social environments, etc. I‚Äôd advise you to refrain from listening (or reading) to people who share horror stories about this drug.

 For sure, it won‚Äôt work for some people, but it does work for millions of people. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you, don‚Äôt get discouraged, your doctor will have you try another med.

Bottom line: Zoloft or some other drug can change your life for the better. Keep trying until you find what works for you; you‚Äôll be so happy that you did.

Good Luck!

**This Too**

I had severe insomnia when I started Zoloft.

I was waking up every 90 minutes or so, often unable to get back to sleep after 3am.

Several weeks in, I think the med had reduced my anxiety to the point where my mind and body could ‚Äúturn off‚Äù and actually sleep.

I started getting 5-6 straight hours of sleep, which eventually turned into 6-7.

2.5 years in and I‚Äôm clocking a sound 6-7 hours per night, which is enough for me. I feel rested and energized when I wake up.

Stay the course, you‚Äôll be glad you did.

And, ask your doctor is there‚Äôs something that can help you get better sleep as your body adjusts to the Zoloft.

Good Luck!",1559347424

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt; Property rights have been enforced without the state.

as ridiculous as this statement is considering that all real estate ownership is a literal contract between an individual and the state (a deed), an LLC is a legal status awarded by the state, etc. etc., we can accept that we live in fantasy land for the sake of a good thought experiment.

Let's make the state disappear, and now private property owners must fend for themselves. Without the state's monopoly on violence to intervene on the behalf of the capitalist, they would have to enforce their property claim (on materials, the factory, the land) on others somehow. Most likely through the use of violence, I would assume. They would likely have to hire agents to enforce this claimed sovereignty on their behalf. These agents would likely be the only people on their territory that are allowed to commit violence without punishment. They would likely be able to forcibly detain people with violence should they refuse to comply with any rules mandated by the owner. how far do we go before we acknowledge this property relationship for what it is, a totalitarian regime? Perhaps, instead of managing the systematic use of violence all on his own, he could band together with other property owners to help organize the distribution of violence across multiple properties more efficiently? how far do we go before we acknowledge this societal arrangement is one ruled by an oligarchy?

Morris‚Äôs paper has been criticized here by Bossio: [""Morris and Krieger reported that the ‚Äúhigher-quality‚Äù studies revealed no signiÔ¨Åcant differences in sexual function ... as a function of circumcision status.""](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266564315_A_Review_of_the_Current_State_of_the_Male_Circumcision_Literature)


[""In contrast, 10 of the 13 studies deemed ‚Äúlower-quality‚Äù by the rating scale employed showed sexual functioning impairment based on circumcision status in one or more of the same domains. Morris and Krieger do not report the results of this review collapsed across study quality. The conclusion they draw - that circumcision has no impact on sexual functioning, sensitivity, or sexual satisfaction - does not necessarily line up with the information presented in their review, which is mixed. However, it is important to note that their article is a review of the literature and not a meta-analysis, thus, no statistical analyses of the data have been performed; instead, the article presents the authors‚Äô interpretation of trends.""](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266564315_A_Review_of_the_Current_State_of_the_Male_Circumcision_Literature)

As for the AAP and CDC, they've have both been criticized that [‚ÄúConceptually, the CDC relies on an inappropriate construal of risk in its benefit vs. risk analysis, since it appears to interpret ‚Äúrisk‚Äù as referring (primarily or exclusively) to the ‚Äúrisk of surgical complications. ...underestimated even the known risks of circumcision, by focusing on the comparatively rare, immediate surgical risks and complications that occur soon after the operation, while ignoring or downplaying the comparatively common intermediate and long-term complications‚Äù](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364150/)



The AAP position has also attracted this critique by 39 notable european doctors: [[""Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of nontherapeutic male circumcision in the United States seems obvious, and the report‚Äôs conclusions are different from those reached by physicians in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia.""](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)


[‚ÄúIt seems that the authors of the AAP report consider the foreskin to be a part of the male body that has no meaningful function in sexuality. However, the foreskin is a richly innervated structure that protects the glans and plays an important role in the mechanical function of the penis during sexual acts.16‚Äì20 Recent studies, several of which were not included in the AAP report (although they were published within the inclusion period of 1995‚Äì2010), suggest that circumcision desensitizes the penis21,22 and may lead to sexual problems in circumcised men and their partners.23‚Äì29 In light of these uncertainties, physicians should heed the precautionary principle and not recommend circumcision for preventive reasons.‚Äù](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896)

As an example, if a person's home is here, but they rent an apartment in NYC for the occasional late night, even if they commute home to Connecticut 350 days out of the year, and only stay in their NY apartment for the remaining 15 days, if they were present in NY for any portion of any day for more than 183 days, for tax purposes, they are a NY resident.

To qualify  for transition you often have to undergo therapy first. And when that is signed  off surgery  can be recommended. But you're basically saying  the medical community is willingly changing a person's body despite the wish being done as a part of a ""mental illness""

By saying  they are mentally I'll you are in effect demonizing there feelings as being not valid.

Homosexuality is not a mental  illness.

Neither  is being  transgendered 

Read this article 

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321258.php

Literally 71 percent  of people  who underwent reassignment surgery report  an improved quality  of life.

Where is the detriment  when people feel happy with their  decision ??

In order for something  to be classified as a mental illness  there must be a significant disruption to ones daily life and well being 


Yet you wanna shit all over it and call them mentally I'll when 8n fact the only 'treatment' for gender dysphoria is the surgery  you condemn 

With  a 71 percent remission rate in people who underwent the procedure - the absolute best depression drugs on the market  don't  even get that success rate.

If giving into their  mental illness by having  surgery  was being mentally I'll you would  not see positive results..",1559347427

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Generally, you should be able to find a strong dissent community *firmly embedded in the scientific establishment* (not blogs or a couple of stray papers) if a corporate-backed body of evidence is wrong, probably wrong, under dispute, or misleading to the point of being wrong in practice. Climate change is one such example. 

What GMOs are is nothing that radically different from the sort of selective breeding that produced corn and bananas from nearly inedible wild plants. If anything, they should be less concerning, since the genetic manipulation is very specific, very targeted, very controlled, and closely documented. This is much harder to do for the spontaneous mutations that are behind traditional methods for breeding.

The 4th amendment supposedly guarantees protection from unreasonable search and seizure. According to the amendment, for a search to happen, probable cause and/or a warrant are needed. Supposedly. It‚Äôs now bullshit thanks to the war on drugs. Why? Look no further than drug sniffing dogs. Legally, if a drug dogs sniffs drugs, then that gives probable cause for a search. Never mind the fact that drug dogs are [wrong 80% of the time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_v._Harris). Think about how a dog indicates drugs. It sits. Now, think about how many ways there are to get a dog to sit. Dozens. If a cop doesn‚Äôt like you, he can simply make the dog sit in another way and suddenly he search your shit for drugs. Probable cause is dead

Meanwhile, a crime against humanity is defined as ‚Äúa deliberate act, typically as part of a systematic campaign, that causes human suffering or death on a large scale‚Äù.

OK thanks, Ill introduce it slowly.

So the SPF 110 Sunscreen is good, and PA++++ is not that needed then?

OK, so can you just give me the go ahead on these products to purchase:

-The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution 240ml

-Neutrogena Sunscreen Lotion SPF 110, Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sun Cream, Water Resistant, 88mL

-20% Vitamin C Serum

-Hydro Boost Moisturizer (which can be used night time as well)

-Clean and Clear face wash

...Perhaps I should look for a specific night time moisturizer too? Is this a good starting list to slowly introduce?

For crop fields they generally have AMF combinations rather than EcM due to associations and benefits being far greater. My PI loves AMF like no one's business so a handful of us work with it.

The cool thing is that there are more companies that are starting to see the benefits of AMF in crops like corn and soybeans, and to an extent wheat, for non GMO cultivars in addition to microbiome manipulation.

I also put in alerts for the checking account for any activity under a certain amount, i did this to prevent fraud because I had an issue with this before, but it also works wonders if your partner slips back and overspends because you will immediately get a message alerting you. If they spend it all make sure not to give in to giving them more, my husband would spend his money is 3 days, the allowance is set to last a month lol, but little by little by me not giving in he knew i was serious and he has learned how to budget his money and even treats me to eating outside sometimes with his extra money.

This year, honestly, has been hit or miss. Now that monthly seasonals are a thing, alts are more common than ever. Of the New Heroes banners, more than half were about getting beasts, binding blade felt overdue, and Darkness Within was great but outside of Mareeta were all alts. And to top it off, we all know we're approaching the three houses and CYL banner-a-thons, I feel like the June banner is the last surprising one until.. September, maybe. 

I should mention while having beasts are exciting, they're clearly meant to work with other beasts, and the four easily available beasts (Neasala, Mordecai, Panne, and Reyson) do not make a great team. If you're not willing to commit your orbs to beast comps, they're interesting but at times frustrating and awkward. 

Weapon refines, on the other hand, are genuinely exciting. They help update old units and chances are at least one of them will be easily accessible, even if they tend to double down on a character's niche (which helps make them viable, even if not meta).",1559347433

"zenbuddhism","t5_2s19u","I was reading about a Plum Village sister who recently went to Thay's root monestery in Vietnam to visit him. She spoke about how beautiful the grounds were. But that in recent years, a pig farm had been established very nearby. She said the stench was so awful and sickening, but even worse, they were woken each morning at 5 a.m. to the shrill sounds of pigs squealing-- quite like sceaming-- and that it felt like hell on earth to listen to them. 

It is hard for me to imagine staying in such a place voluntarily, and to be able to live the joyful life of a monastic in that condition. It made me feel sad to think of Thay living out his final days in a place that I am sure he deeply loves...but...

And often they get by with less than they actually need, or they gorge too much.  They aren't some bastions of moderation or environmentally conscience.  They are greedy and competitive.

A typical anyone can't comprehend something if they don't study or experience it.  But India is also a ""free"" country.  So how are you suggesting that the ""free world"" is different from India?  And no, experience is not the same as facts.  What one experiences is not always true or real.  For instance, parts of India are completely different.  So just because you experience one part of India doesn't mean you understand India as a whole.  And living in a few developing countries, does not mean you understand developing countries as a whole.  And it also doesn't mean you understand people or societies as a whole.

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","1. **Strategy name:**  The Tortoise and the Air: Slow and Steady without a Chain
2. **Boss:**  Adamantoise
3. **Describe your Strategy:**  
I have no Wind Chain, and my magical Wind team is woeful at best.  I had to rely on BSBs and Radiant Shield for all my DPS needs.  Thankfully, the damage formula for Summons and Ninja abilities partially gets through his tough defenses.
4. ***Insight!:***
 * Tyro casts Godwall first turn.  He then repeatedly uses Raging Storm until he has enough SB to cast USB1.  Then it's back to Raging Storm until he has enough SB to cast Godwall a second and final time around the 32 second mark.  By the time Wall runs out, most of Adamantoise's attacks are piercing anyway, and Astra becomes more important.  Once Raging Storm hones run out, Tyro switches to Wrath and keeping Astra/Haste up with his USB1 for the rest of the fight.
 * Alphinaud uses Deployment Tactics first turn.  He then uses Dark Valefor until he has enough SB gauge to cast BSB.  He then uses BSB CMD2 for Ether effect to replenish Dark Valefor.  He then uses BSB CMD1 until SB gauge is ready to replenish Deployment Tactics every 30 seconds or so.  He then goes back to Dark Valefor to generate enough SB for BSB, and repeat the cycle.
 * Fujin uses Chain Tornado until she has enough SB to cast her BSB.  She then uses BSB CMD2 to lower Adamantoise's RES.  This part is actually essential, or even the entry cast of Syldra may not break 9,999 to break Savage Mode (even though this is only a brief window of increased DPS, since Syldra's regular attacks can't keep him out of Savage Mode).  She then uses BSB1 CMD for most DPS.  At one point, she does get enough surplus SB gauge to cast SSB for en-Wind, but this is definitely not necessary.  If Fujin's turn comes up right after Adamantoise has cast Savage Mighty Guard, she uses Gust since it will still do close to 9999 damage.
 * Onion Knight uses Meltdown until he has enough SB gauge to cast mUSB.  He then goes back to casting Meltdown and builds up plenty of extra SB gauge.  He recasts mUSB either when the mode runs out, or if a Haste renew is needed after Adamantoise uses Savage Bestial Resonance (though Tyro may also be able to renew the Haste with his USBs).  At one point, he has enough surplus SB gauge to cast pSSB for some DEF/RES breakdown, but this is absolutely not necessary.  Toward the end of the fight, once all hones of Meltdown and Tornado are used up, OK switches to using his BSB and its CMD2 for chip damage.
 * Elarra waits a few seconds to select Dispel on her first turn, so it gets cast right after Adamantoise uses his first Mighty Guard.  She summons the Fabula Priestess on her second turn.  For the rest of the fight, she uses either Curada, Dispel, or USB1 depending on the needs that turn.  She is usually the one to summon Syldra.  If either Slot 1 or 5 manage to get confused despite Tyro's Astra, she is the one to attack them. 
 * Because only Syldra's opening attack can break damage cap, there are only brief windows of increased DPS.  Having a single Wind OSB for the above characters would probably speed up the clear quite a bit.
5. **Holy Trinity casts:** 
 * Wall: 2
 * Medica: Too many to count
 * Hastega: Too many to count
6. **S/L count / Medals lost:** Complete only, no Mastery
7. **Time:**  1:33:23

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Yeah, and that's fine. 

The thing is you're posting on a sub that lives football. 

Most of the people on this sub have been looking forward to this game for 3 weeks now. It's literally one of the biggest games in the world.

The date and venue were announced years ago. 

Most here know where it's going to be played, and what time it was going to be played, and some know who was going to ref it and run the lines, and I bet there's even some who know the name of the groundskeeper behind the lawnmower. 

Starting a video about a game when you don't even know when it's going to be played doesn't inspire confidence, especially on r/soccer. 

I can see that you enjoy making vids, so keep doing so. Either post this one to a sub that only has a casual interest in soccer, or make vids that you have a genuine interest in. 

I'm really not trying to criticise you, it's that with that opening most here will just switch off. 

Good luck.",1559347434

Imo pom poko is the most underrated Ghibli film but I have a feeling that it wouldn't appeal to westerners as much.

I also had a good friend, born and raised in rural Leitrim --he's now sadly deceased-- who spoke with an accent nearly identical to that heard in so many of these Travelers videos, and while he was a farmboy and certainly not a Traveler, if it's true that the Travelers are descended from those dispossessed by Cromwell --""to hell or Connaught!""-- then it makes sense that they would have a nearly identical accent to the settled families in Leitrim who were also pushed westward by Cromwell.  

Anyhow, until I see something definititive or at least persuasive, my inclination is to be skeptical of said Cromwellian origin story, though of course, were it true, it would not be the first example of real history hiding beneath a veneer of folklore.  

Another way of coming at it may be to ask; are there known instances of Irish Travelers in pre-Cromwell Ireland, and if there aren't, when and why did they show up in the historical record?

Edit:  The more I think about it, together with reflections on what admittedly little I know of Irish history, the more likely I see the creation of a landless wandering class of Irish families as being almost certainly the result of the Cromwellian plantation of Ulster.  The only other source would be the famine, which certainly put vast numbers of people on the move, but we read that the Travelers existed long before the famine.",1559347435

But the statement you're quoting is something of a platitude anyway.

&gt;It is for this purpose that speakers believed to deliver **valuable** ideas are invited to campuses. 

(emphasis added). I don't see anyone here arguing that this is not part of the goal of universities. The argument is over whether (for example) Peterson's ideas are valuable or not. You're criticizing it by saying that it would give creationists, for example, a platform, but I think all of us here agree that creationists' ideas are not valuable.

I think it's also worth noting that there was a time, in the 19th century and before, when creationists were given platforms to debate in universities. They were given their chance, they lost, and now their ideas are generally considered a thoroughly beaten dead horse. But it's not the case that they were never given the chance to debate. And if they hadn't been given a platform it wouldn't be established that their hypothesis is wrong.",1559347435

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","Yes, the accumulation of salts is the potential problem here. That happens if for some reason the salts precipitate after entering the soil solution(usually a pH-related problem, but will probably result in deficiency symptoms and not toxicity and not outright water stress and wilting), or you introduce more than the plants acctually take up and assimilate(which will eventually give toxicity symptoms and wilting due to a reduced water potential).   
This is where the point about concentration of nutrient salts in the solution used in watering and the rate of uptake vs rate of supply comes in. If you get this right you do not get an accumulation of these salts throughout the growth medium. To monitor how this is going you will need to do quantitative measurements, qualitative measurements will just confirm if the thing you test for is present or not. If you do not have access to meters to determine this, looking for toxicity symptoms and wilting that you can not explain in other ways than ""oh poops, looks like the water potential of the soil solution has gone to the hot-and-smelling-of-sulfury-place"" is the 'easy' way to keep track of this. You might kill a few plants before you get this right. If that is going to hurt you more than you are willing to accept you can either keep researching the topic 'till you are confident that you will get it right, or, I guess, just 'close your eyes and think of Science' :P

&gt;R1. John Wick  


I'd be inclined to say he cuts through the police quickly, but can't find Sarah before she escapes.  


&gt;R2. Shrek, Donkey and Puss in boots 


Relatively unfamiliar but surely they lose? I'm sure they're held at crossbow point in the first film, and if that's a threat an M16 certainly is.  


&gt;R3. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli  


Lose. Their enemies have guns.  


&gt;R4. Raptor squad from Jurassic World.  


Arguably the best here for tracking Sarah. Unfortunately they lose badly against the police because there's no long grass.  


&gt;R5. Nolanverse Batman  


Wins. He kicks off the fight, then disappears onto the roof and waits for Sarah to try to escape so he can grab her.  


&gt;R6. MCU Captain America  


Wins easily. Incaps the police, then as per the highway scene in civil war easily outruns and catches the car Sarah and Reese use to escape.  


&gt;R7. Xenomorph  


Tricky one. 50/50 I think. It'll beeline for the ceiling cavities and ambush. Sarah's on her own while the police search, so she's vulnerable. On the other hand, there are a lot of police, and a single xeno is quite vulnerable to guns.  


&gt;R8. Indoraptor  


Loses. It's big and not stealthy and probably not bullet proof. Sucumbs to wounds beforeit gets to Sarah, although it inflicts heavy casualties on the police.  


&gt;R9. T-1000  


Assumes the form of the rammed police officer. Kills Sarah and Kyle in the confusion without even being spotted.  


&gt;R10. 2005 King Kong  


That escalated quickly! Wins easily by demolishing the whole station. Dies of bullet wounds later.",1559347438

While Yerin and Lindon's paths are all about applying pressure and attacking, Mercy is the only one with defense measures. Now that she's and Underlady she has access to her crystalline armor bloodline ability. Also, being the daughter of a Monarch and her generations genius, I would say she has the greatest overall knowledge of the sacred arts.

Yerin is second behind Mercy because she has greater technical skill as well as knowledge over Lindon, her Steelborn iron body is just now showing it's benefit at Underlady, and of course her blood shadow.

This brings us to Lindon, who I will say I think would get progressively better over the course of multiple fights thanks to Dross, but lets face it, he's still only been practicing sacred arts past the Foundation level for 3 years. He has the least amount of knowledge of the sacred arts and the least amount of technical skill among the group, and has also shown the least amount of mastery over the skills he already has.

How many months of Medicine wards have you done?

&gt;But corner cases isn't the problem. It is the pervasive attitude of many admitting services that as soon as they get on the phone with the E.D., the only thing going through their head is ""how do I punt this to someone else"".

I agree with you here, I‚Äôve definitely seen this be a problem with some people. Ultimately the answer is to do what‚Äôs best for the patient and that really should involve a respectful discussion rather than saying ‚ÄúI want to admit this patient‚Äù then walking away from the case.",1559347438

I asked the teacher during the lesson, of course got told no and to wait. So i waited and I remember just doing weird dance in my seat the whole time shes talking and not really listening. Finally she stops talking its like the end of that lesson and were working on our sheets so I try to ask to go again, that I reeeeallly need to go, and idk if she didnt believe me or if it was cause i didnt have any notes left but again she said NO and said I was going to have to wait until either lunch or school was over? ( we were close to one of those times but I had already been holding it for a while now) And At that point I could not hold it anymore and straight up pissed in my seat.

Dumbest thing I‚Äôve seen someone do while drunk:  when I was a teen I was at a house party and a friend of mine who was completely trashed swore that he could pee on a bug zapper and pinch off the stream before it hit the zapper and completed the circuit.  I tried to talk him out of it but he wasn‚Äôt hearing it.  He pulled down his pants, started walking towards the zapper, grabbed his dick and promptly tripped on his own feet, rolled onto his back, and peed all over himself.  It was hilarious.",1559347442

I actually think 25% actors, 50% crew and 25% producers &amp; investors is better. People always praise acting but rarely even know what the screenwriter, director, DOP and editor are called. The crew deserves a lot more recognition, if not most of it. I appreciate actors and I know what they do is hard and demands lots of talent and work, but what they earn is extremely overkill.

Andy goes from:

- The Preppy douche with anger issues to the Preppy douche after anger managment. However even this is really weird, because he wasnt being hated for being angry, he was hated in the office for being a preppy douche, anger management shouldnt have stopped him singing ""Zombie"" over and over. 

- Then from Preppy Douche to a more relaxed person, but much worse salesman (despite clearly being competent enough at Stamford) after he finds out Angela cheated and lied to both him and Dwight

- He keeps this personality for his Erin arc, all the way up to getting his job back from David Wallace

- Then does an 180* turn and becomes an even preppier douchier dude after ""confidence building"". He becomes vengeful and just starts completely ignoring Erin, then Plop comes in as a discount Jim.  The problem is that ""old Andy"", which is generally the Andy after anger management but before confidence building as thats the personality that stuck the longest, would have never acted this way and it shows, they needed a jerk and so they made Andy one.

- On a smaller note, Erin goes from loving Gabe because hes so interesting to apparently having a loveless relationship the whole time when she wants to break up with him and Andy brings the exes back in. Just so Andy can have a chance with her.

- Andy turns into even more of a dick, eventually peaking with the 3 month trip to Jamaica where he just loses all respect for everyone else's work. But then weirdly becomes friends with everyone again after he gets demoted (before quitting). 

A lot of commenters here and elsewhere have said that its because the confidence building finally gave him the self image he needed to act like he wanted, where it was rock bottom after Angela's affair. But its just far too drastic of a change.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Hello. 

What you seem to be describing is something similar I went through myself. 

As I approached middle age I began to become very dissatisfied with my life. I started to feel that I had worked hard and been an honest kind person but that the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù had somehow let me down. 

This manifested itself as long rants to my friends and family about how it was not my fault. The answer I told them was this dystopian world we lived in. I too began to take deep dives in to the Internet.  I watched a lot of documentaries and began to read a lot about how the system is broken. 

This started a downward spiral. I felt like society was a hopeless case. That it was so useless, that i could not affect change. This led me to depression and drinking. 

The drinking only fueled my self righteousness. I became  convinced that I was correct in everything. I believed that those folks that disagreed were 100% wrong. 

So the bottom line is that; depression about how my life had turned out and the misguided idea that it‚Äôs the worlds fault and not mine, led me to drink. The drinking led me further down the rabbit hole until I found myself circling the drain. It‚Äôs a cycle that fuels itself. More reading makes you more depressed.  The more depressed I become the more I drink. You get the idea. 

It‚Äôs worth noting that I did become an amateur expert on all sorts of subjects but I only did that because I wanted to trash my friends and family in an argument. 

So I can‚Äôt offer any expert advice here because I‚Äôm not a professional but in my experience booze is a depressant. It helps fuel that feeling that the world is a ‚Äúlost cause‚Äù therefore: I should drink more because what does it matter. 

May I suggest you help break that cycle. IMO the drinking is the first place to start. 

I managed to break this cycle (but it‚Äôs a fight I still struggle with on a daily basis). I hope that you can help your loved one do the same. 

I wish you luck.",1559347444

"Blackfellas","t5_2xfe1","That's why I'm subbed. I've made two (now three) comments on this sub. None of them with my opinion, because I know it's not needed. 

I'll just repeat what I said on r/blackladies when it came up.

TL; Don't want to read: I subscribed because I want to be an ally to people of color. I want to see communication with people that don't look like me and come from places different than me. I want to know what daily life is like. The thing I like most about this subreddit is everyone post about their good days and bad days, I will never know what life is like for a black person but I can read and help myself understand more of what you guys go through.

 **Sorry for the long explanation below**

 Well I was in a bad spot in my life, depressed and suicidal. One night I watched the Straight Outta Compton movie and I was just so amazed. I was a white kid that lived in a rural town that is 98% Caucasian. I was blind to the reality of what black people face and that was just coming from a movie, based off an 80's hip hop group. So I put myself in the culture. Became big into hip hop, RnB. The music of Ice Cube, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole helped me through a tough time in my life. That being said I didn't have much care of what black people were actually going through. I just enjoyed myself into the culture. THAT WAS until I was watching the BET awards and heard [Jesse Williams speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orXogk3euMA\).

&gt;*And let‚Äôs get a couple things straight, just a little sidenote ‚Äì the burden of the brutalized is not to comfort the bystander.That‚Äôs not our job, alright ‚Äì stop with all that. If you have a critique for the resistance, for our resistance, then you better have an established record of critique of our oppression. If you have no interest, if you have no interest in equal rights for black people then do not make suggestions to those who do. Sit down.* &gt; 

&gt;*We‚Äôve been floating this country on credit for centuries, yo, and we‚Äôre done watching and waiting while this invention called whiteness uses and abuses us, burying black people out of sight and out of mind while extracting our culture, our dollars, our entertainment like oil ‚Äì black gold, ghettoizing and demeaning our creations then stealing them, gentrifying our genius and then trying us on like costumes before discarding our bodies like rinds of strange fruit. The thing is though‚Ä¶ the thing is that just because we‚Äôre magic doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre not real.* 

That speech made me realize that I had no right to put myself in this culture while not caring about the people who created this culture. Since then I have tried my damn hardest at every turn to be an ally to not just black people but all people of color. Living  close to Flint MI, I not only donated money but lead my Boy Scout troop to help pass out water. In my final year in high school I helped expose the blatant racism students in our school carried and helped the administration find and punish kids that were racist. I want to be an ally, and seeing the communication here helps me.

 I've never state my opinion, especially when I know it's not needed.",1559347444

Unemployment  benefits doesn‚Äôt pay much and that‚Äôs running out, it helps with rent but I live in an expensive city where average rents are $2000. Savings goes quick. My last job was 6 figures so those rents were affordable. Luckily I‚Äôm single and no kids or student debt, car is paid off long ago so I‚Äôm not totally fucked. Worst case is I‚Äôll have to move out once my lease ends in a few months and live with family. It sucks because I like where I live and just moved in.

Imagine you‚Äôve never heard of a movie in your life. No one has. They don‚Äôt exist. Then one day someone approaches you and explains what one is and how to experience it.

I just feel you're giving bad advise recommending a 1-ton when it's clearly overkill and would make such a minimal difference it's not worth the added expense.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","IMO it's based on the idea that all bars are equal, and in my gym each bar is technically designated for some purpose...whether it's a rack, or a bench, or whatever. If I'm taking a bar to do some non-rack work, I'm taking it away from some bench or rack. So specifically leaving a bar for a squat rack just so I can go grab one from someone who might theoretically want to use a bench to me is pretty much identical. At the end of the day, there are limited (but interchangeable) resources, and it's just about being as polite as you reasonably can while also accepting the fact that you have just as much of a right to use any bar in the gym as anyone else for any purpose.

Basically I use the bar that is closest to the area I'll be doing the work. On my traditional deadlift days (i.e. not leg day where I do Romanian deadlifts), I typically grab a bar from a bench because that's the area I do those deadlifts. On my leg day I grab a bar from one of the squat racks because I'm just finishing doing squats, then Romanians, leg presses, leg curls, etc....all leg stuff. If I abandoned the bar in the rack and tried to find another one, there may not be one. So then I've delayed my routine based on the logic that somebody else's squat is more important than my Romanian deadlifts. Instead I think it makes sense to do what I need to do as rapidly as possible while giving other people a fair opportunity to do their work without me getting unnecessarily in the way.

Hopefully that's pretty clear. My experience in these situations is that just about everyone is happy to go grab a bar because they're used to people literally doing deadlifts/curls/rows in the rack or some other silly thing. Takes them maybe 10 seconds and gives them a clear path to continue their program.",1559347448

Deferment isn‚Äôt the only option if you‚Äôre eligible for an income based repayment plan and live abroad. The trick is that your income based repayments are tied to the adjusted gross income reported on your US tax return (less an allowance for what‚Äôs effectively a poverty level cost of living). If your AGI is close to zero, your monthly payment will also be zero. This is not considered a deferment. The fun part is that if you live abroad, you generally are eligible for the Foreign Earned Income Tax Exclusion, which excludes the first $103k of non-US source income from your US taxable income. Since this adjustment is made ‚Äúabove the line,‚Äù i.e. it reduces your AGI, you can effectively earn a bit more than $103k per year abroad, and have an income based repayment amount on your student loans of $0. After 25 years, any outstanding liability is forgiven under the rules for income based repayment plans (resulting in US source taxable income at the time of the debt forgiveness).

Tl:dr if your loans are eligible for an income based repayment plan, and you live abroad, you may qualify for a very low or zero monthly payment‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre earning in the low 6 figures.",1559347449

"NewYorkMets","t5_2s7w9","MLB ready players are always more valuable than prospects. The further a prospect is from playing in the big leagues, the less valuable he is. Hopefully you can understand that a player who has shown he is capable of holding his own in the big leagues right now is always going to carry more value than someone who might make the big leagues a few years from now.

&amp;#x200B;

Re the Dickey trade, the trade was a win for both sides. You clearly don't understand team strategy and where each franchise was in their life cycles if you think otherwise. The Blue Jays with Dickey made the ALCS twice and placed first in the AL East once. Dickey pitched over 210 innings for three years for the Jays, and while his stats look mediocre only 12-15 pitchers threw more innings than Dickey those seasons. Yea, his WAR isn't great because that's based on the fake FIP stat that only values K's, but he was an important piece to the Jays rotation those years.

&amp;#x200B;

Contrast that to Syndergaard, who at the time of the trade the Jays could not hang their hat would be ready to pitch in the MLB in 2015. Thor did ok in his freshman year, throwing 150 or so innings to a 3.26 ERA (which would look more like a 3.96 ERA in the AL).

&amp;#x200B;

The ugly part is that although Dickey has pitched over 800 innings for the Jays, Thor has only pitched over 500 for the Mets in the same amount of years. As a result, the trade only looks like a fleecing if you only consider Thor's 2016 season. If you look at Thor's career as a whole - which includes a lot of time on the DL - the trade looks a lot more even. Dickey was never going to blow out his lat by lifting too much weights in the off-season in an effort to throw a 110mph fastball.

&amp;#x200B;

And that is why the fact that Kelenic is in A-ball is entirely relevant. We don't know how he'll adjust to each new level of play. And even if he does succeed in MLB, he's more likely than not to go through ups and downs and the growing pains that every new player goes through. It's possible that he's a future HOF who will break into the bigs in 2022 and never look back, but it's a lot more likely that the road is significantly more rocky than that.",1559347449

 Em 1965, Vaz Galv√£o foi o primeiro [preso pol√≠tico](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/clovisrossi/2019/03/a-ditadura-que-nao-houve-matou-423-pessoas-no-brasil.shtml) da [ditadura militar ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2014/50anosdogolpede1964/)na Ilha das Pedras Brancas, mais conhecida como Ilha do Pres√≠dio. ‚ÄúNa pr√°tica, reinaugurei o local como pris√£o e estive l√° por quase um ano. A solid√£o era muito grande‚Äù, conta o capit√£o de 83 anos.

 Por mais de seis meses ele foi o √∫nico preso na ilha de Porto Alegre. Na d√©cada anterior, o lugar serviu de pris√£o de seguran√ßa m√°xima, pela dificuldade de fugas. Mais tarde, chegaram outros detentos.

 Segundo levantamento do Movimento de Justi√ßa e Direitos Humanos (MJDH), pelo menos 82 pessoas foram presas no local durante o regime militar. N√£o h√° registros oficiais dispon√≠veis. Por ali passaram [pol√≠ticos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/poder/po0805201108.htm) como [Raul Pont, ex-prefeito de Porto Alegre](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/opiniao/fz0110200510.htm), e [Carlos Ara√∫jo, com quem a ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff foi casada](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/08/1909567-dilma-lamenta-morte-de-ex-marido-carlos-araujo-viveu-visceralmente.shtml).

 A reportagem visitou o local e se deparou com uma mistura de beleza natural e descaso com a mem√≥ria do lugar. Ap√≥s alguns minutos de navega√ß√£o √© poss√≠vel avistar as imensas pedras brancas e arredondadas que d√£o nome ao local. √â poss√≠vel caminhar entre elas e explorar as ru√≠nas da pris√£o, vandalizadas por visitantes.

 Tombada pelo Iphae (Instituto do Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico e Art√≠stico do Estado) em 2014, desde 2005 a ilha foi cedida pelo estado ao munic√≠pio de Gua√≠ba ‚Äîno meio do rio, ela fica entre Porto Alegre e Gua√≠ba. Desde a concess√£o, renovada at√© 2035, nenhum dos projetos sugeridos pela comunidade para o local saiu do papel.

 A prefeitura de Gua√≠ba diz que ‚Äú√© preciso fazer um estudo mais profundo para saber qual √© a capacidade para receber visitantes‚Äù sem risco ao ambiente e ao patrim√¥nio. A ideia do munic√≠pio √© ‚Äúimplantar um espet√°culo de som e luz, com embarca√ß√µes ancoradas no entorno‚Äù, e realizar atividades educacionais.

 Um dos projetos foi encomendado pelo MJDH. Mais modesto e focado na hist√≥ria, ele prev√™ na ilha um totem de 2,5m de altura com as inscri√ß√µes ‚Äúaos que aqui estiveram‚Äù. No Cais Mau√°, no centro de Porto Alegre, de onde sa√≠am as embarca√ß√µes com os presos, a sugest√£o √© instalar placas no ch√£o √† margem do rio com a inscri√ß√£o do nome dos presos.

 A hist√≥ria de um dos presos ficou conhecida como o ‚Äúcaso das m√£os amarradas‚Äù. Nascido em Bel√©m, o sargento Manoel Raimundo Soares, amigo do capit√£o Araken, foi torturado no Dops e posteriormente preso na ilha. Era comum os presos serem retirados da ilha para torturas ou interrogat√≥rios no Dops.

 Ap√≥s uma dessas sa√≠das, em 1966, seu corpo foi encontrado por um pescador boiando com as m√£os amarradas. As autoridades tentaram justificar que ele j√° havia sido solto quando morreu, o que era mentira. Os respons√°veis n√£o foram punidos.

 Foi por causa dos trajetos entre a ilha e o Dops que foi poss√≠vel a cria√ß√£o de uma biblioteca secreta no pres√≠dio, relembra o banc√°rio aposentado Paulo de Tarso Carneiro, de 77 anos. Na delegacia, os presos da ilha eram deixados em uma pequena sala para n√£o serem vistos pelos demais.

 Na mesma sala ficavam as centenas de livros ‚Äúperigosos‚Äù apreendidos pelo aparato repressor, como os de Karl Marx e L√™nin. Um a um, eram levados escondidos pelos presos √† ilha. L√°, eram organizados e catalogados por Carneiro, o ‚Äúbibliotec√°rio‚Äù informal, que foi preso em 1970. As obras ficavam em um v√£o entre o telhado e a parede s√≥ acess√≠vel por escada.

 Carneiro lembra que os preferidos dos presos eram ‚Äú1984‚Äù e a ‚ÄúRevolu√ß√£o dos Bichos‚Äù, de George Orwell, que tratam de regimes opressores, e ‚ÄúTr√≥pico de C√¢ncer‚Äù, de Henry Miller, apontado como ‚Äúpornogr√°fico‚Äù e proibido nos Estados Unidos por muitos anos.

 ### Imp√©rio e ind√≠genas

 A hist√≥ria da ocupa√ß√£o da ilha, por√©m, √© pr√©-hist√≥rica, segundo o historiador Tau Golin, do Programa de P√≥s-Gradua√ß√£o em Hist√≥ria da Universidade de Passo Fundo (UPF). H√° ind√≠cios de que ali viviam, assim como nas demais ilhas de Porto Alegre, ind√≠genas canoeiros, especialmente guaranis.

 Os registros oficiais da ocupa√ß√£o datam principalmente a partir de 1835, quando a ilha serve de plataforma de passagem para o ataque dos farrapos a Porto Alegre durante a Revolu√ß√£o Farroupilha. Os farrapos eram republicanos e queriam a independ√™ncia do governo imperial.

 Anos mais tarde, o Imp√©rio, que venceu a guerra, ergueu ali em 1851 uma casa de p√≥lvora, que armazenava muni√ß√£o para os militares. Talvez a umidade do local tenha feito com que a fun√ß√£o fosse modificada d√©cadas depois para abrigar um laborat√≥rio de pesquisa animal, passando a ser um pres√≠dio de seguran√ßa m√°xima e finalmente um pres√≠dio da ditadura a partir de 1965. O local foi desativado ap√≥s a redemocratiza√ß√£o.

 O historiador tamb√©m defende que seja constru√≠do um memorial na ilha. ‚ÄúH√° uma disputa simb√≥lica sobre a mem√≥ria da Ilha. √â aquilo que na hist√≥ria chamamos de presen√ßa na aus√™ncia. Aparentemente n√£o tem nada, mas tem a hist√≥ria do Brasil e do Rio Grande do Sul, desde os ind√≠genas, o s√©culo 17 e a ditadura militar‚Äù, diz Golin.",1559347450

"norfolk","t5_2rt3o","Greek fest isnt related to Granby High. Its a festival celebrating Greek culture at the Greek Orthodox church that happens to be a block or two from the high school. Its best known for the food. But if you've been around Norfolk awhile, there are good chances of running into people you know. It's one of the more well known local events. 

I grew up not far. Like a three or four block walk from the high school, down Thole St. So my family always rode bikes up there and ate. One year was the first time i had calamari. Just ate it having no idea it was squid! Delicious! 

I graduated from Granby in 2003. At the time the school had been freshly renovated. We were a fairly early school to have computers in every classroom, even though most went unused. It was a good school overall. Out of the schools in Norfolk at least, its the one you want to attend.",1559347451

Up until now, I'd never think about building a deck without at least 2 healing-oriented cards per character. But this makes so much sense now that I think about it. 

First Aid costs 2 resources and an action just to put into play, and then you need to spend an action each time you want to heal (which is almost always gonna happen at a point in the scenario where every action counts). 

Beat Cop costs 4 resources but comes with a +1 combat boost, and offers the equivalent of 2 healed horror and 2 healed damage, all with one action - and, if played right, deals one free point of damage to an enemy. 

It's a no brainer, can't believe I never considered it before. I guess you'd have to be careful not to overstuff your deck with allies, but there are plenty of cards or strategies to work around that.",1559347451

Right when I woke up and the anesthesia wore off, the first thing they had me do was stand up and try and walk around. Which I was able to do, it hurt a bit but I was able to do it. I was on like 3 different painkillers for my stay at the hospital. I cant remember how long it was, I had the surgery about 10 years ago it so.
 
I dont really have any limitations tbh, after like maybe a year or so I was perfectly fine to lift and do whatever, i was still careful but I was able to do whatever really.

I had to go back and have 2 more surgery's however, the 2nd time my body rejected the stainless steel and caused an allergic reaction and I had to go in and have it cleaned up and the 3rd time the same thing happened again but by then I was told that the bones were all fused together so they took the metal out. I more or less feel fine now, I still feel a bit of a curve on my spine but I think that's because my spine was so fucked when I had my surgery, I was like 2 or 3 degrees off of being paralyzed for life if I didnt have the surgery when I did.",1559347455

You're responding to someone linking an Onion article that claims in the title that the US is the only place where mass shootings regularly happen. This is true. Your article is comparing deaths in mass shooting events over a series of years, and the series of years cuts off in 2015 (US deaths have only been trending up since then) and the deaths are simply averaged.

For reference, the US had, I believe, mass shootings in *every* year during that timeframe, while Norway had a single one. In fact, no other country on the list had more than a couple mass shootings total. Yes, Norway's single one was particularly deadly, but if the average were taken from a longer timeframe or if the median were taken instead, Norway would be extremely low on the list. A lower population country having a single deadly mass shooting can dramatically sway any statistics taken from such a short range; in reality, the median is a better metric because it isn't so easily affected by skew, but the US is basically the only country that doesn't have a zero median for yearly shootings.

There are ways to represent statistics to convey a message that the data does not back up, even when the data is technically correct. You must always keep this in mind whenever looking at random stats on the internet.",1559347455

At first I thought that the HW was just one game making fun of all the events that FF Co. claims is BS, but at the same time the first picture that was displayed in the opening scene was Nightmare Fredbear, which by the story, nobody should know about except the FNaF 4 protag (since, you know, he's a nightmare). Same thing when it comes to the Nightmarionne.

So what I'm guessing is that FNaF 1-UCN are also canonically GAMES in the FNaF universe, just made to replicate the actual story that we havent seen. So it seems like every single game we've seen from the franchise are also games in that universe.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","**MOVE**

MOVE is a black liberation group founded in 1972 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by John Africa (born Vincent Leaphart) and Donald Glassey, a social worker from the University of Pennsylvania. The name is not an acronym. The group lived in a communal setting in West Philadelphia, abiding by philosophies of anarcho-primitivism. The group combined revolutionary ideology, similar to that of the Black Panthers, with work for animal rights.

I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs anything wrong with you.

Since he‚Äôs trying now, and you don‚Äôt want to blow up your life, I‚Äôd encourage you to set some kind of deadline (say, a year), and until that date, try to behave with him like you did when you still had romantic feelings for him. How did you treat him when you were first dating? Do some of those things.
If, after your deadline is up, your feelings towards him haven‚Äôt changed, then maybe start considering more drastic measures (or resigning yourself to a loveless marriage).",1559347457

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","I was in robinhood until last week, when I went from 27k to ~62k; didn‚Äôt have the choice! It was honestly too expensive to consider even if they did offer it. I actually just completed my switch to tastyworks yesterday with the remaining 50k (After taking out the rent money I‚Äôd put in to trade with and some for summer sessions tuition as well).

I know it‚Äôs just 10x the size of SPY, but I‚Äôm not a fan of the wide spread or the lower volume. Thus, I‚Äôd be more comfortable going into spx options  after I get a sense of how easy/hard it is to get filled and get more familiar with it generally.

Plus, since I don‚Äôt have other income, it‚Äôs actually not the end of the world. Since I‚Äôm in the low brackets 60/40 doesn‚Äôt really make a big difference . Especially since I can establish residency and go for the instate tuition rate, which is a third of regular tuition (I‚Äôm at UCLA).

Also, I honestly haven‚Äôt gotten into selling options. I‚Äôm not really knowledgeable enough, I should really look into it. I know the strategies, but I don‚Äôt really know the specifics of the margin requirements in detail. I could be retarded and completely wrong but from my limited impression the margin req. ties up a bit too much buying power. If I‚Äôm buying a larger quantity of call or put and need to have some insurance, I usually just buy a smaller amount and/or a further out the money option on the other side to mitigate risk. Especially with the current swings, I‚Äôve been able to sell both sides at a profit at times. 

And honestly, I would really appreciate any pointers and clarifications. I‚Äôve only been trading for a little over 5 months (options for about a month and a half to two) so I definitely have knowledge gaps. Please let me know if anything I‚Äôve written is wrong and forgive my ignorance if I‚Äôve misunderstood any concepts and such!",1559347458

3. I told someone that them going several days only eating cheetos was really bad for them (she took it as ""omg why do you gotta attack me?"")

"GuildWars","t5_2quyl","What I disagree with is the idea that WoW has had underlining changes in the gameplay. GW2 had that compared to GW1. While yes some things have been adjusted, ‚Äúmodern‚Äù WoW is still built on the same foundations as it originally was. GW2 was only made because arenanet thought they needed a new foundation for what they wanted to do. 

I think WoW has added storyline and mechanics to the game. I don‚Äôt think the fundamentals have changed. To me, it feels mostly the same except leveling is now set to ‚Äúeasier than easy mode‚Äù, and, as I said, more mechanics and story. Just the same as eotn added more mechanics and story in relation to prophecies. 

I think where we may not be seeing eye to eye is in regards to ‚Äúwhat is gameplay‚Äù. To me, the gameplay is how I play the game. what buttons I use and what I do to succeed. In WoW, it‚Äôs still the same taskbar with the same abilities, with similar mechanics in raids/dungeons, and the same old professions. I still get to accept a quest, go kill x creature 10 times and collect 5 items from it to get a reward. I still farm/craft x item to profit. Yes these have been expanded upon, but besides swapping out some skills, I don‚Äôt see a different on a fundamental level. 

Also, I definitely think Cataclysm was a changing point for WoW. I think they started pulling the game in the wrong direction, but to me the core gameplay is still the same.",1559347458

If she doesn't respond contact the police and see if they will escort you to her home to force handover or arrest her. I understand that this is not pleasant for the child to see, but that is on your ex. If you continue to allow her to do this the behaviour will continue. If the police won't get involved this time document it, get a text or email evidence she acknowledges her refusal to allow you parenting time, and once you have more than a handful go straight back to court to breach her. The extent of her doing this may also inform you whether modification of orders are needed to minimise her continuous disregard of court orders acting against the childs best interest. The fact the police were willing to get involved previously migh5 mean you have a good chance of an escort to go and force her to hand over.",1559347458

Car is about a week old (drove to Palm Springs from Vegas to get it, then to SD/LA on a road trip to finish the break-in). Ive experienced the problem while coming to moderately abrupt stops (using a lot of brake pedal) both with the clutch all the way depressed (and out of gear) AND with the clutch engaged, but in neutral. It's happened at least 6-7 times now. My car is a 2019 GTI S in black 6MT. I thought it may have been related to the safety suite on-board (my cars only option). I havent taken it to the dealer yet as Im still on my road trip, but will once Im back in the Vegas area.

Edit: NHTSA report filed. Will hit up the dealer this week and report what they say.

UPDATE: only one stall since passing the break-in mark of 1k miles. At 1500 miles now. Haven't had a stall since (and Ive tried inducing it). Still opened a ticket with VWoA, filed with NHTSA, and visiting the dealer today. Will update as necessary",1559347460

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","Sure there were some dumb criticisms of the writing, I agree that Jon not petting Ghost is not a problem (although that was more of a meme thing than a legit critique). Some people were mad that Dany dies and that Jon never becomes king, and wanted them to live happily ever after, which was never going to happen and does not fit with the ethos of GRRM and Game of Thrones. I actually really like Jon killing Dany and ending up in the North, on paper. It could have been wonderful.

But most of the critiques are valid because a lot of the writing was legit *abysmal*. 

- The entire defensive strategy at Winterfell is some of the dumbest tactics ever put on screen, a sin given how smart and detailed oriented GOT used to be. The writers turn all of the good guys into complete morons 

- There is no scene of Arya and Sansa discussing the implications of Jon's heritage. Wut. Apparently 20 mins of tension killing fake out deaths, Eureon and Jamie fighting for some reason, and people rearranging chairs was more important than two major characters realizing that their father had actually never betrayed their mother. What was the point of one of the greatest reveals in TV history if you do almost nothing with it?

- Dany's heel turn is some of the most contrived and underwhelming bullshit I have ever seen. That moment should have ripped your heart out, Red Wedding level. Instead it was confusing and dumb. Turning a flawed, complex but lovable character into a boring cartoon villain was beyond stupid and just killed all the tension, emotion and drama the final episode should have been packed with 

- The entire scene it which Bran is chosen to be King. Just...all of it. Its beyond shit",1559347464

I ball up my fist, I swing it.  If that is done just like this was, as part of a consensual BDSM sex act for foreplay, it is not assault.  If it's done to the same person when we're having an argument, then it is domestic assault.  The act, the target, the outcome is the exact same, but my mental intent is different.

You seem to be trying to say that pointing a gun at someone is automatically intent to murder, but the law does not recognize it that way.  Just like hitting someone with your fist could be assault, kinky sex, a sporting contest.

Likewise pointing a gun at someone could be armed robbery, a part in a movie, kinky sex, part of military or police training, all kinds of things.

There is no such thing as automatic intent, from actions and words you can infer intent but the same action can have many intentions depending on context.

We all have things that we aren't exactly happy about with ourselves or pictures we took that we aren't quite happy with the outcome, trust me we've all been there. There are times I personally can take like 100 pictures before I find one that I even slightly feel is kind of acceptable and even then I still am not a fan of something in the picture. 

However calling out these things or hating on yourself in the title in any way only serves to detract from discussion and cause an almost ""fishing for compliments"" effect where comments only discuss said negative title and in general it's something we avoid around here.

If your picture follows the rules you are free to repost it with a different unrelated title (Titles or comments referencing previous removal or self hate related new titles are not allowed, they cause the same problem and are also grounds for post removal) I hope you understand and have a great day.

Mike was expressing his opinion which was TRUE it was 100% a pity rose, the same way Cam thought him quitting his job would gain pity. i am also someone that at times doesn't use the proper words to articulate myself but holy shit did we all get Mike's point.

ALSO Mike's story was different because the pregnancy stuff resonated with his own past guilt and was authentic. hannah was like let's have a fun low stress tailgate party and cam thought it was more important to name all his traumas GRANDMA PUPPY LEG.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","*Whazza?  Truck?  TRUCK!  Aieee... Truck?  Trees?  Big trees?  Big deep jungle trees?* ""Uh, guys?  Anyone have a clue where we are?""

""It looks like the Amazon forest.  The flora I can see from here matches anyways."" That's... well, for this record, we'll just call him bioboy.  Our resident nerd for all things biological.

""Did any of you notice a flash just before we ended up here?"". That's scigirl.  Heavy into science, the really deep stuff.  Which means she should be mathgirl too, but you'll find out we already have a math person too.

""Lesseee... Mass of vehicle and occupants, distance, time... Can't do instantaneous, assume one second... Holy, that's a lot of energy!"". And there's mathguy.  Him and Scigirl spend so much time together, everyone else expects them to Ship.  Only they seem so oblivious...

""Teleportation or doorway?  Hey!  Where's Mr. Jones?  Or Ms. Archer?"" That's 'SciFi', our resident futurist, or total nutcase, depending on just how far out there he is at any moment.

The rest are gear-heads, jocks, cheerleaders, wives and/or husbands to be, goths, with lots of overlaps.  Usually useful to have around, but so tied to their worlds that the weird just doesn't seem to affect them much.  We'll call them ""Danes"" (From mundanes, like ""muggles"".)

Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.  I'm 'author'.  Pleased to make your acquaintance.

*Knock Knock*. ""Hello the bus!  Welcome to Second Chance!  May I come aboard?  I'm your guide and driver."" I think everyone jumped.  The Danes were happy to find anyone who claimed to be in charge, the rest of us weren't so sure.  Since there were more of them than us.  He came aboard.

""First, your driver and chaperone are alive, if not healthy.  They are not here because they were going to survive."" I think SciFi was the first to catch on.  ""So, we were going to die?""

""Not to put too fine a point on it, yes.  That's why this place is called Second Chance.  Each of you were going to die, or at least be in a permanent vegetative state for the rest of your lives.  We find that to be a terrible waste, so we try to pull people out before that happens.

I'll answer the next few questions we've learned are most common.

Can we send you back?  No.  The technomagic that brought you here is still mostly magic to us.  We can pull people about to die, we cannot push people back to where they came from.  Or anywhere else for that matter.

Are you time travelers now?  No, neither you nor I are time travelers.  This is the same year, day, hour, and at the time of your arrival, minute.  We're not sure about seconds.

Can you use other means to get home?  The best we can say is that you can *try*.  We'll outfit you the best we can.  Food and other supplies we can make or grow here.  Even some common tools.  You may imagine that a number of expeditions have tried.  None have ever managed to send help back.  We don't know why.  If they died, the technomagic didn't pull them in a second time.  If you're determined, we'll help, but we suggest that you stick around long enough to learn the dangers.  This isn't Kansas, it's the Amazon Basin.  Not a particularly well explored part either.

If you stay, what will you do here?  Anything you can.  Some lay about for a while.  That quickly becomes boring, not to mention that most folk become ... tired ... of mooching off the labor of others.  Don't think you have any skills that are useful?  You'd be surprised.  Any sports team members?  Good, we need entertainment.  Authors?  Excellent!  I hope you have a hat full of ideas.  Cheerleaders?  If it isn't leading cheering for your team, there are well attended competitions.

Crafts that you enjoyed?  Many materials are available, although they may not be like the ones you're used to.

Farming?  It isn't the crops you're used to, but it makes a welcome change to the glop the technomagic puts out.  Fully nutritious, decently flavored, soon boring as hell.

A word of advice on risk taking...  The technomagic can heal you... if we can get you to it still alive.  No ambulances, no oxygen systems, no IVs; not for lack of trying but we're in the position of a shipwreck.  We have to build the tools to build the tools to build the tools ... I see your getting the idea.

If you see something we're doing, and you think you can improve on it, go for it!  It doesn't matter if a dozen people have tried before you, we've had some successes because the new person had some crucial idea, or bit of knowledge, that no one had before.

Now, while you think that over, let's get this bus moving before it gets too dark.""

The ride was bumpy, and we had to clear brush at times, but they'd obviously done this before.  We soon came to a path.  Part of a grid that allows access to much of the local area.

Republicans don‚Äôt win racial demographics because they don‚Äôt pander to racial demographics. 

Campaigning to win a racial demographic is in itself massively racist. You‚Äôre going to tell an entire racial demographic to vote for you because you don‚Äôt hate them? They aren‚Äôt pets. I‚Äôm astonished that this is remotely acceptable. 

Hillary and Gore were wondering around the south with battle flag banners in the 90s dude, politicians are shit I‚Äôve been trying to get that point across. 

Now if we can move into the 21st century, without the Trump administration pandering to minority communities the Black employment rate is now the highest it has *ever* been. Combined with the huge population of black churchgoer conservatives who are always ignored by the media 2020 will be a historic turning point in black republican votership, and that‚Äôs without treating them like helpless common folk who need to be told how to vote. 

Democrats win racial demographics because it‚Äôs all they have, they count on minorities voting for them, yet nothing good ever comes of it. Minority communities vote and vote and vote yet still live in poverty under democrats. That is racism right there.",1559347469

They can set a horrible lap time (like +5 minutes) while they learn, then chase themselves down faster and faster. I've had a couple people get hooked. Also it helps to use monitors, VR is off-putting for new players as they will undoubtedly experience some motion sickness as they're not used to it like we are. Monitors are often more clear as well. If they want to try the Vr, have them get comfy on the monitors first, then switch to Vr once they can complete laps without doing donuts in the sand and complaining that the grass physics don't feel realistic....

"asoiafcirclejerk","t5_2tvge","###The first  mid-credits scene in Game of Thrones *ever* after feature length show finale. 

Michelle Fairly in zombie makeup runs up a river bank, gasping for breath. Approaches camera, [breaking the fourth wall like Emelia Clarke did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLd5gNcvIEU), in the Season 3 Episode 8       ""Second Sons.""

Catelyn Stark is not the same. She is Lady Stoneheart. She struggles to overcome the handicap of a slit throat and she rasps:

""Am I too late?""

Camera pans sharply right, like an early 1970s Akira Kurasowa Godzilla film. George R.R. Martin makes the cameo appearance that fans have been waiting for since the pilot was announced. He is wearing his fishing boat hat and the same crusty 50"" W 28"" L Wranglers he has been wearing since he decided to focus on 'The Winds of Winter' (i.e. 2018).

Lady Stoneheart:  
""You sold out.""

GRRM:  
""Aye, mayhaps.""

Lady Stoneheart:  
""What did it cost?""

This detail is really important. HBOs ((chosen people)) are controlling this finale ya fucking goyim! Not that wilful hack Neil Marshall. Not even that dutiful bannerman Mark M'Lawd. So yes, we are directing on the page and we will be directing on set. Dan shouts 'Act' and Dave shouts 'tion!' Where were we going with this rant? Yes, setting scene.

A very tight close up of George's face allows us to see the author emoji. Creatively it makes sense to us to write for the cast we carefully selected. 

Lady Stoneheart:  
""Answer me ~~Adam~~ George! What did it cost?""

*A solitary tear runs down the authors face.*

GRRM:  
""Everything.""

Ramin Djiwadi composes another home run as we hear the music swell. While not strictly-speaking violating copyright, it is very obvious to the audience that a familiar melody is hidden in this synthesizer orchestra masterpiece. Is that 'The Imperial March' from the 1977 space samurai kino 'Star Trek'?

I think especially when it's framed in a ""for those who don't know"" kinda way it irks non-Americans, due to the stereotypical ""**blindly confident know it all**"" attitude that is sometimes attributed to Americans.

"kittensgame","t5_30q51","What's your current Transcendence level? Higher transcendence levels will make farming both TCs and relics easier. Varying levels of Transcendence, going up to level 15, grant you access to Cryptotheology bonuses that will help a lot with relics and TCs.

&amp;#x200B;

* Black Nexus (T3) increases the amount of relics you get from Relic Stations, and the number of relics you get from refining TCs into Relics.
* Black Core (T5) lets you store more BLS. More BLS means you can build more Black Pyramids, which improves your refining and Relic Stations.
* Event Horizon (T7) increases your storage by a lot. More storage means you can build more production, meaning you get more from each TC shatter, making it easier to reach a self-sustaining loop.
* Black Library (T9) increases your science limits, making it easier to build deeper into space, increasing your production.
* Black Radiance (T12), increases how fast you get Alicorns, which you feed to the Leviathons, giving you more TCs and making it easier to hit the TC shatter loop.
* Blazar (T15) makes your Resource Retrievals better, gives you more resources from each TC shatter, also making it easier to hit a self-sustaining loop and giving you more TCs back per shatter. It also makes your Void Resonators accumulate more faith, helping you hit higher Transcendence levels.
* Dark Nova (T20) gives you more energy, letting you go deeper into runs where you can store more antimatter to build more stuff, and build more AI cores to increase your storage. Not quite as important as the previous ones, but becomes very important for deep relic runs.

&amp;#x200B;

If you haven't gotten to some of the higher Transcendence levels yet, you might want to focus on getting some Paragon first, and finishing up some of the other challenges, letting you build up some Transcendence in the meantime. 1000 years is especially helpful, since it lets you shatter a lot more, if you're planning on doing the shatter-TC loop. Anarchy also gives some bonuses to Karma gain for reset, so if you plan on building ever-increasing numbers of Cryochambers to get access to more kittens for more paragon on each run, you could prioritize that first to get more Karma for more kittens. As you build up your Cryptotheology, you'll notice your Relic and TC farming getting faster and faster on each subsequent run.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have access to Blackchain, you can use that to generate relics for you as well. Buy low (700-900) and sell high (as close to 1100 as possible). Keep buying and selling throughout your run, spending relics as sparingly as possible, to let your relic stockpile grow. You'll gain 30-40% of your # of relics with each buy/sell, which is far faster than your Relic Stations. At the end of your run, if you don't have enough Chronospheres to carry your relics over to the next reset, spend all your relics on Crytotheology upgrades to make the next run faster. If you reach the point where you can reset with more relics than you had, then its worth spending only a portion of your relics at the end of a run, and carrying the remainder into the next run as a seed to re-invest in the Blackcoin market to keep growing your stockpile. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once you have a self-sustaining TC-shatter cycle, you can also convert TCs to relics too. Shatter/trade until you get a huge stockpile of TCs, convert them all to relics, (save some spare Unobtainium to trade for TCs to keep the cycle up), and invest them into the Blackcoin market.",1559347472

Cuz it's KD and he is one of the greatest pure scorers in the game? Cuz people are willing to take a risk on an all time great player who can totally change their team? Cuz there are always desperate GMs? Cuz the NBA require every team has to pay for insurance for their top five-paid players so they could maybe write off KD if he never comes back?

Take your pick. Tons of reasons. Just take a look at all awful contract currently on the books. Some GM will offer KD a max no matter what.",1559347473

According to your logic, because any system can have a history of being flawed or unjust, we shouldn't abide by the rules of any system.

You realize I could use the exact same logic you're using for multiple systems within government, right?

- Why pay taxes? The system is corrupt and nobody trusts it. I shouldn't have to follow the rules if the system is unfair. 

- Why follow the law? The criminal justice system is corrupt and nobody trusts it. So why be an honest person and follow the law if I'll end up falsely imprisoned anyway?  I shouldn't have to follow the rules of the whole system is unfair.

You can quite literally rationalize away the legitimacy of any system in place using your train of thought. We can't function as a society like that.",1559347473

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","&gt;Yeah, your backbone (CPU, MB, RAM) is holding you back here.  
&gt;  
&gt;That CPU is 7 years old now (released june 2012) and quite frankly, the i7 3770 wont be that much of an upgrade, is the same era (released April 2012)

&amp;#x200B;

I was most pointing out that every one telling the OP to go Ryzen for \~ $500 vs a drop in replacement for $50-100 ( 3770 ) makes almost no sense  .  The Difference in most games would be very small for the money spent ( and would be better spent on a GPU upgrade vs a System . Where a 3770 would make a difference in gaming and give much better $/fps .

&amp;#x200B;

3770 is \~ 10% faster then a 2600 (  [https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-3770-vs-Intel-Core-i7-2600/1979vs620](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-3770-vs-Intel-Core-i7-2600/1979vs620)  ) 

&amp;#x200B;

In these benchmarks (  [https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2867-intel-i7-2600k-2017-benchmark-vs-7700k-1700-more/page-3](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/2867-intel-i7-2600k-2017-benchmark-vs-7700k-1700-more/page-3)  ) then you could use the 2600k stock scores as a pretty close reference ( both the 2600k and 2600 have the same boost clocks ) 

&amp;#x200B;

Watch dogs 2600k was 10% slower then r7 1700 ( so basically the same as a 3770 would score ) 

Total War: Warhammer 21% slower ( so 11% faster then a 3770 ) 

GTAV 16% slower( so 6% faster ) 

Ashes Of The Singularity 14% slower ( 4% faster ) 

Metro: Last Light 6% faster ( so r7 could be 4% slower ) 

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3412-intel-i7-2600k-revisit-2018-benchmarks-vs-9900k-ryzen-more](https://www.gamersnexus.net/hwreviews/3412-intel-i7-2600k-revisit-2018-benchmarks-vs-9900k-ryzen-more) 

&amp;#x200B;

F1 2018 10% faster ( so even ) 

Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Origins 27% slower ( so 17% slower ) 

Far Cry 5 13% slower ( so 3% ) 

Civilization VI 6 % slower ( so 4% faster ) 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a Vid that shows the 3770k doing very well vs the R7  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMTkfdtleQg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMTkfdtleQg) 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess the main point is every one is always pushing people to grab a Ryzen as a fix all solution when the difference for gaming is pretty small . And the Big selling point that these boards can be used for future chips is not a selling point for most ppl asking these questions . As they have a 7+ year old system now that has lasted them ( and is likely a time period that they would upgrade again ) , so at that point the new amd cpus will need a new board as well . Most ppl don't buy CPUs yearly for the 5-10% gains we get .",1559347475
"Marriage","t5_2reak","You‚Äôre making a lot of (possibly) faulty assumptions here. My husband and I have children, and honestly, that was/is less stressful for me than wedding planning. In American society, you are encouraged to put your foot down and stand up to your parents (barring conservative/narcissistic/emotionally abusive/strict upbringings, whatever), but how do you know what culture these people have been raised in? 

But with wedding planning, even my American friends are shocked by how ingrained it is in them to try to please everyone, to the detriment of their happiness, and yes, sanity. Let alone if OP or his fianc√©e are from a particular culture or upbringing with strong wedding traditions and an expectation that weddings are a collective, full family life event, not a celebration of the couple in question.",1559347475

"Blackops4","t5_2untl","The problem with multiplayer is that additional maps are largely unplayable because most people don't own the Black ops pass. This was improved in the last update that allows you to share the maps but it's still not great. Additionally, guns have to be unlocked usually late into the operation unlike blackout where they're immediately available. The only thing multiplayer gets right away are new specialists that are generally unpopular to begin with.

Zombies is shafted in other ways like the mode not working for first few months, promised features like factions still being MIA, and there still not being high round leaderboards almost 8 months in.

Blackout has gotten new modes, new locations, alcatraz, and has every new weapon immediately available. It's overall the better mode and clearly the main priority even if support overall has been lacking.",1559347475

As another commenter said, the adoption idea where she could still keep in touch is wonderful. I also agree she‚Äôs trying to use this child to replace the family she‚Äôs lost, and that‚Äôs just her way of trying to cope I assume. 

Therapy might be a good idea for her also. So she can cope with the loss of your parents and try to level/mature her head to process this pregnancy. I can‚Äôt imagine being in this situation, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in the middle of all of this OP. I hope it all works out.",1559347477

Thief is often a card that comes down and is just immediately answered, but that is kind of the point.  Thief combined with other threats makes the threat density of this deck very hard to deal with, and sometimes curving into Thief of after a thought Erasure just immediately wins the game.

I can however see the appeal to a build like this.  Most people will just assume you are on Thief and this leads to some powerful gotcha moments where you board out your Heroes and become Esper Control postboard.  

While I like some of the things this list is doing, with command the dreadhoardes and 3 Oaths maindeck, I think it might be overturned for the aggro matchups which in my opinion is already a fine matchup, but not doing enough to improve some of the tougher matchups like Control, Phoenix or Dreadhoarde/Planeswalker Decks.",1559347478

Because your account is new (under 4 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed. Both conditions must be met in their entirety and no exceptions will be made at all.  

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/entitledparents requires all accounts to be at least **4 days old** AND have **at least 100 comment karma** in order to create new threads. Participate in the subreddit if you want to post in the subreddit. New users need to have a feel for this website before we allow them to post on this subreddit.  

Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. You get comment karma for making good comments that people upvote. You lose comment karma if you make dogshit comments that people downvote. If you have less than 100 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all. On your user page you will see a breakdown of post versus comment karma; you may need to hover over the karma number (or the i icon) to see the details. If you're on mobile, use your fucking browser. Go to https://old.reddit.com/u/YOURUSERNAME to see both kinds of karma.  

The moderators will no longer be manually approving posts. If your post gets removed and you choose to accumulate comment karma, you will need to post your story again; this post will not be automatically restored.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Seems like people have gotten you all the info, but just to consolidate it:

The Secret Victories emblem has two variants, 'Drink at the Well' which is a random drop from the Blind Well, and 'Transcendent', which is rewarded once the six Ascendent Challenges' time trials have been done (which can be checked in the Destinations/Dreaming City section of the Triumphs page). Obtaining either variant also awards you the base emblem.

I have never found a source where people have said they've gotten Secret Victories independently of the variants that drop. It seems the variants drop, which give you the Secret Victories emblem. I could be wrong, but it seems like most if not all people get Secret Victories via getting one of its alt emblems.

My experience was I had the 'Drink at the Well' variant drop after a Blind Well encounter, netting me it and 'Secret Victories'. Later, I finished all of the time trials and received the second alt emblem, 'Transcendent'.",1559347481

"awoiafrp","t5_3ja0f","Rodrik took in the sight of the castle as he followed the women towards the feast hall. He could sense his father beside him as he scanned the faces of every man at arms and every servant they passed and he especially made sure to look over the women of the castle. He didn't know how long they would stay and he very much intended to get to know some of the women he fixed his eyes to as they passed. The sister of the Lady Serena was one such that had caught his eye. The Lady Sara had blushed quite prettily at his comment and he had not failed to notice that she seemed quite taken with him judging by how her eyes had locked upon them.

*She seems a likely lass to bed, so she does.*

Roose had not failed to notice his sons glances at the Lady Sarra. He knew the hunger his son had for women, for it was something he himself had at the same age. He knew the potency of it, and the danger. He knew that if he didn't get his son to rein in his lust that it could prove a danger. He didn't want to earn the ire of the Lady Serena. For he had no doubt that she was her mother's daughter in temperament as well as looks based on how she acted. 

Roose smelt the feast hall well before they arrived to it, the scent of roasted meats making his mouth water in anticipation. When they arrived he was not disappointed. The sights that complemented the smells did them justice as he took in the feast. He resolved to eat quite a bit of roasted meat and wash it down with fine wine. His sight of the feast was soon distracted by the gesture and words of the Lady Serena.

&gt;‚ÄúPlease, make yourself comfortable‚Äù

He smile beamed upon the lady, courteous and true and he then noticed the bread and salt offered to them as well.

""You do us too much honor Serena.""

He then stepped forward and dipped a piece of bread into the salt they were offered and ate it, accepting the law of hospitality offered by his host. He did not notice his son grinning at the lady in response to her own beaming smile as he he followed and copied his father's actions with the bread and salt.

Rodrik has various lustful thoughts as grinned at the lady.

*Maybe this sister instead of the the younger. She carries herself like a proper lady. The younger one seems more eager but I bet this one would be more pleasant to break in.*

Unaware of his son's looks or thoughts Roose looked back upon the Lady Serena.

If you were building a dps fleet, have you thought of using 2 Battleships/ Battlecruiser with a CV, then a debuffer, self buff for vanguard? 

Amagi with any BB (i use NC as shes my fav ship) then Enterprise, reason I suggest Enty is that her dps is unparalleled.  Amagi with Washington, duke of york is deadly too. 

Minnie, Monty, Helena, Portland Retrofit, Belfast(which you use) all excellent choices, they all have debuff or buff of some sort. If you was to upgrade your Laffey then Ayanami Retrofit or Yukikaze will wipe the Boss HP.

&amp;#x200B;

But to look specifically at Putin and Moscow, you have to go back hundreds of years. The Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the modern Russian Federation have always had a defensive position against the west. It makes sense. You cant just go back to World War 2 to look at Germanic invasion of Slavic territory, its been happening since Kievan Rus. This kind of history just disappear from a national conscience over night and is largely the impotess for creating a buffer zone between western Europe and Moscow, in the form of the Warsaw Pac and now in disrupting Ukraine and Eastern Europe from entering NATO.   

&amp;#x200B;

Western Europe increasingly became interconnected over the 20th century without the inclusion of and increasingly isolating communist Moscow. The collapse of the Soviet Union didnt solve this confrontation between East and West, though for some time it softened the threat perceived from both sides.  

&amp;#x200B;

Both the United States and Russia act in their own self interest. Those self interests are often in conflict with the other states' self interest. And often in conflict with Beijing's self interest, and the EU's self interest, etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

In 1961 Washington DC was putting nuclear arms in Turkey, right at the back door to Russia. At the same time Moscow was putting nuclear arms in Cuba, right at the back door to USA. I think this may be summed up with a few simple lyrics....

You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports

As a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try. This may seem like a drag but it's really important because school education on individual drugs is awful and you obviously don't collect social knowledge like people do with alcohol. When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. 

You will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.

"kendo","t5_2qo63","I started later than you and it was difficult in the beginning since I was making so many mistakes but as others mentioned, there is no judging. What is unique to kendo for me is the individual walk, my goals are not the same as yours, but we can spar and practice together. My sensei and sempai (senior students) will push me for my own goals but it's not like we're racing to hachi dan level. I do share a bit of social anxiety, it took me many months of practice before I lost that ""racing heartbeat"" walking through the doors of the dojo. I also struggled to clear my mind as I was so focused on not making a mistake that I ended up holding back too much. I still have that ""well, I don't want to commit to this action too much since I am not sure, better do it half way"" which my sensei can see right through me and tells me to do better. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few things that helped me during my short experience (which is still going!) with kendo. Stay humble, it's really hard to take criticism and feel like you're failing over and over. It's part of the process, and once you wear the bogu, it becomes even more apparent of your mistakes. But your sensei and sempai will help you, point out your faults to help improve, not put you down. Another thing is once I walk into the dojo, I think of myself training in isolation, this might not be the correct mindset, but I really focus on my swing, how I'm moving, and rarely pay attention to anyone else. I will, of course, acknowledge them during practice. I'm just not looking at how everyone else in the class is doing and comparing myself. So this gives me more able to focus on myself, without distractions. 

&amp;#x200B;

During sparing, I also think the same thing. My focus is only on my opponent, and the men help by blocking my side view. I know that I might look terrible with my kai, or sloppy strikes but during the sparring, so I can't think of doubts or criticisms during this time. There are times when I think about quitting but I go again and it gets better and better.

It takes a lot of time, a lot of money, and meeting a lot of requirements. I think that might start changing if the public gets behind it‚Äî the government would start funding research, and trying to develop a regulatory framework that makes it easier for new plants to be developed (and public support would certainly reduce the risk of plants having to be shut down or stopped during construction).  The thing is that republicans don‚Äôt particularly care about climate change, and democrats and environmentalists have abandoned nuclear. Still, because it‚Äôs not as partisan as renewables have become (a recent bill aimed at aiding research and streamlining licensing restrictions [sailed through Congress easily](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/512/actions) , I think of there was public support there might actually be more legislative action than with plans for 100% renewable.

Correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds like:

* Got upset when the person who would be responsible for damages enforced the limitations.

I wouldn't want to be responsible for 200 people either, if something went wrong would you have stepped up and done something, or just let Troy's house get wrecked at this so called ""trap house"" (also, stop it, don't ever call it that again lmao)?

A genre savvy unsnap-lusted Tony Stark absolutely would have added a restriction to make sure that only the Avengers in the room could access the gauntlet. Thing is though, they didn't know who would do the honors of unsnapping everyone until the glove was finished, and they were eager to get everyone back, so it makes sense that that particular measure would be done away with.  


Perhaps another consideration: this isn't a regular piece of Stark tech. It's not a button you press to activate it, the stones themselves seem to interact with whoever carries them. Thanos's gauntlet was more of a housing unit so the stones weren't directly up against his skin and melting him that way. If someone is somehow in control of all the stones then they can make a wish, and I don't think anything Tony has access to could physically prevent Thanos from snapping.",1559347485

"StrawHatRPG","t5_3axaa"," The remainder of the school day went from bad to worse. In what seemed like some divine conspiracy against her, she was called on in every subject that she had after lunch, all for questions she didn't know. 'What suit in a deck of cards represents the Holy Grail?', 'What is the medical term for a brain freeze?', 'What makes the king of hearts different from the other kings?' Some of these questions seemed so unimportantly trivial, which only served to increase her frustrations.  

To add insult to injury, she was constantly reminded that exams were just on the horizon. The perfect way for her to be reminded how bad she was at some of the subjects. In her frustration, she punted a coffee can across the campus quad. It ricocheted off of a bench, against a wall, and then landed just beside the trash can. Typical. Not that she was aiming for anything, but in seeing it get so close she had gotten her hopes up.  

As she turned to look for another littered can, she was approached by the bald boy once again.  

What‚Äôs wrong? What a loaded question. It seemed almost obvious to Linette that everyone around them was dreading exams. There was some palpable aura in the air. While she was certainly worse looking than some of the other students who wouldn‚Äôt have to study hard to do well, it wasn‚Äôt grounds for concern. That, and she hadn‚Äôt exactly forgiven him for lunch either. She prided herself in being a capable human being, which people seemed to think was uncommon for the girls around this part. A low blow like that really tore at her ego in a really unpleasant way.    

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Well, I dunno- err,‚Äù Linette realized she couldn‚Äôt actually recall this dude‚Äôs name. ‚ÄúNevermind. I have to go study for exams. Y‚Äôknow, that thing that we have to do to get into a good college?‚Äù As the boy continued to walk beside her, she tightened her grip on the kendo sword at her waist. She slowed her pace so that he was walking ever so slightly in front of her and then she made a sharp turn towards the gym. The volleyball club had the space today, but with any luck she could find Aiden or someone willing to go a few rounds so that she could get some anger out.

If you inspect the element using DevTools, you can look at the styles: https://imgur.com/a/0RvqDMI (scroll down and you'll see the default browser styles at the bottom, as well as any styles applied by extensions).

There's also then the ""computed"" tab which will show you every computed style for that element. https://imgur.com/a/1mbzezu

In this example, I've expanded the `padding-top` and `width` properties.  You can see the `padding-top` is applied by the user agent stylesheet (browser) by selector `button`, and then the `width` property is applied by code on line 23 of the doc (inline-css) by selector `#play_button`.

As browsers can have different default styles, it's pretty common in production to use something like [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to add some consistency.",1559347487

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","1) You never brought up their supposed good work. Is this supposed to somehow justify their atrocious behaviour in other fields? Immigration was addressed in response to another users comment. The link about Marshall DeRosa brings up major concerns about just what their prison reform entails - so good of you to read the sources. Its clear their claims are merely PR smoke screen.

2) The historical connections are not dubious. Martin and others were at Freedom School/Ramparts, IHS, published in Reason, at CLS, and Cato. Do you deny any of this? The association with likeminded individuals continues to this day. The sources are not dubious, one quote his writings, another is a picture of a Barnes pamphlet published by Cato, and another is an interview with Martin himself. What is dubious here? You simply don't like the uncomfortable conclusions that they lead to and want to suppress consideration of them.

3) What is dubious about this quote: *Martin told Reason's journalists that he relied on the works of Europe‚Äôs leading Holocaust denier, Paul Rassinier, whose books ‚Äî ‚ÄúDebunking the Genocide Myth,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Drama of European Jewry‚Äù ‚Äî described Nazi concentration camps as ‚Äúa gesture of compassion‚Äù designed by the Nazis to ‚Äúrehabilitate the strayed sheep.‚Äù According to Rassinier, the Holocaust was a ‚Äúswindle‚Äù concocted by money-grubbing Zionists out to ‚Äúmake Germany an ever-lasting milk cow for Israel.‚Äù* - what do you believe has been spliced up here and omitted?",1559347487
"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I'm highly manipulative, have a quick and vicious temper, and I take things very personally.

To remedy my manipulative nature, I've tried channeling it into writing those sorts of characters. That way I'm still harnessing my natural inclinations without harming anyone else. It doesn't work perfectly, but it's definitely better than nothing. 

My mom put me into therapy/anger managment when I was a kid, so while I still get very angry very quickly, I know how to control it. Of course, this means that if I let it loose I'm doing it on purpose and don't have an excuse...

My CBR is under a cover almost all the time, with a [hardened steel chain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpVOTEOMRuE) looped around the subframe and a wooden support beam. No one can move it. Then I have a Xena disclock on the front wheel so that if someone tries, it will make a lot of noise. But actually I took the battery out because it likes to go off for no reason, and I don't think the noise will do anything but annoy my neighbors. So it only appears as though the alarm is working, which is enough for me.

My daily driver has full-coverage insurance so I don't lock it unless I am going somewhere sketchy and then I'll just bring the Xena.

As for eggs being gross out sometimes, I get that as they used to gross me out too, until I started cooking them better and seasoning them more. Now I love it and haven't tired of it since. 

 Not sure what it's called, but I crack the eggs and let them drop in the frying pan, yolk still whole. Then I douse them with pepper and basil immediately, and then with the  spatula carve a space between the eggs and fill it with diced onions and mushrooms (keep in mine you can use whatever you like for seasoning and sides). Then I let it all cook together until the bottoms are almost burnt, only then flipping them over in the pan, turning off the flame, and letting them cook upside down by the dying heat until they barely sizzle (A minute or two). That way the tops are lightly cooked and the bottoms are heavily cooked. Since doing it this way, eggs haven't grossed me out anymore.

I'm betting the gross out factor is that they're undercooked (for your taste) and not seasoned enough/too bland.",1559347489

Really depends what you're looking for but just a heads up advice, when looking for games quite a handful of them will have FPS issues that might bother you so it's always good to look up YouTube videos of them before buying the games. 

An example of this

* AC3 (good game but noticeable drops around 20-25fps)
* Ark survivalist game (badly optimized)
* Grip (frame drops)

no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.¬†
....
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy.¬†

Who says you need to rush office to earn money?  Play base off where you spawn in Labs and you can easily make 1mil+ each run.  Having certain keys just gives you more options to do stuff.  If office is an option it easily pays for itself going in there 2-3 times.

I've made hundreds of millions of rubles playing Labs.  You literally need to survive 1 outta 4 or 5 raids and you'll break even.  Labs is arguably the most profitable map in the game if you know how to play it.",1559347496

There are lots of other ways to get drachmae, but ship destruction seems the best for materials. 

Quote myself from another thread regarding drachmae:




I was in the same boat a little bit ago. Message boards/passive contracts are a great way. 

Also, just play the game. What I mean is I just started clearing all ?s and side missions around the map and beating up on all these Greek nerds and I collected a ton of gear, xp, and drachmae. 

Mercs. Get 3+ helmet bounties and just kill all the nerds coming your way. Loot, repeat. 

Leader hopping. Locate leaders on your map, go there and kill them along with their high level entourages. Repeat. You get much epic loot. 

Attika wall run. YT a video about it. I think there‚Äôs only one video and it‚Äôs hard to find but basically you just run along the perimeter wall killing guards and looting weapon racks and you can get a substantial amount of gear to sell. 

Forts. Forts have good gear loot and they respawn. Make sure to loot all the weapon racks and supply crates. 

Sell bows and high level swords, deconstruct all other gear. Or sell it if you don‚Äôt need the materials. 

I did this stuff for a little while and went from 300k drachmae to over 3mil pretty quickly.",1559347498

Can you have some sort of ""street"" roll cage and fuel tank installed to increase the chance of surviving in an accident?  My friend called them ""Widowmakers"" and I'm curious just what he means by that.  I don't want to wear a helmet when driving on the street, but my admittedly limited understanding is that most roll cages require the use of a helmet in the event your head impacts one of the bars.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Let me preface this by saying my comment is solely focused on administrators and says nothing about physicians. Please don't take it in any way to diminish the intelligence and work ethic of physicians, who are among the brightest and most hard working people around. 

Being a hospital CEO is not a fun or cushy job in any way. It takes a wide range of skills, of which a CEO needs to excel in all of them. There are no days/nights off or vacations. Even when on vacation, they're answering emails and calls. They are tasked with dealing with atrocious levels of regulation which are changing by the second. A constant barrage of threats to the viability of the business, including regulatory inspectors, changing payment patterns, changing service models are things they face constantly. What is a cash cow today is tomorrow's loss leader. CEOs need to not only foresee the changing landscape but make constant and drastic changes to ensure the hospital stays, at best, within 2-3% profit (which inevitably is reinvested into growth, not like they're pocketing it themselves). CEOs have no family life, no social life, no hobbies, no time for anything but the company. All this while managing some of the most challenging personalities the can find clustered in one place. A good CEO definitely earns their pay.",1559347501

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; You continue to fail to point out exactly what backs your side up. Your just providing general here is a link find it yourself answers. 

Fair enough.  If you want specifics I will have to narrow the focus of the discussion, so I'll just cite the original topic of discussion; obstruction of justice.

&amp;#x200B;

Start on Vol 2 page 107.  Reading up until page 115 should present ample evidence, but if it isn't enough to convince you the evidence for obstruction continues until a decent conclusion paragraph for the topic on page 158.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;‚ÄúThe then-senior Department of Justice (DOJ) official briefed both senior FBI and DOJ officials in summer 2016 about Christopher Steele's Russia dossier, explicitly cautioning that the British intelligence operative's work was opposition research connected to Hillary Clinton's campaign and might be biased.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;I bring Hilary up because the core documents that started this entire thing were bought and paid for by HC and the DNC. Without it you have nothing and is why the dems dont want an investigation into how this witch hunt started.

I disagree with HC on a lot of things, and I voted against her in the primaries but opposition research is nothing new or unethical.  Every political candidate does opposition research, and it is actually a good thing because it brings dirty deeds to light, and the american people deserve to know about a candidates past deeds.

&amp;#x200B;

The FBI began investigating DT's Russian connections quite a while before the Steele Dossier was released.  You can see a rough timeline here:  [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-probe-timeline-moscow-mueller/story?id=57427441](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-probe-timeline-moscow-mueller/story?id=57427441) 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason the Steele dossier was taken so seriously is because it corroborated information the Department of Homeland Security received from other sources.  Also, Steele was an informant for the FBI in several other investigations.  Even if you ignore the Steele Dossier, there is still a ton of evidence of Crimes committed by DT from other sources.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, Fusion GPS began working on the Steele dossier after being hired by Marco Rubio during the primaries, and stopped when he dropped out of the race.  A while later HC hired them to continue the research.

Gold is more than sufficient. There is really no need for Titanium. Besides, the efficiency rating doesn't even necessarily reflect the build quality.

&gt;Fans, paying a 100% or more premium for noctua fans aside, is it reasonable to assume that if I have 3 intake fans behind a high quality dustfilter, I'd need only 2 exhaust fans (without a filter of course) ?

Yes.

&gt;Thermalpaste or Carbonaut, considering the plan to not open up the case for 6 years+, thermalpad is the right choice ? or are there thermalpastes that have shown to last that long, I am a bit worried about any paste used in a potential graphicscard as well (I think the RVII actualyl has a thermalpad out of factory, but going with outdated vega architecture is not the plan)

Hero achievements I've gotten on my own so far without cheesing. [I made a gallery, though didn't bother to screencap every single noteworthy cosmetic.](https://imgur.com/a/HfZ5IC0?)

* I have every base game and event cosmetic, including even Anniversary 2019. The only event achievement I don't have is ""Volley"" for Lucioball which I'll get this Summer. I managed to get all of the Archives Legendary and no incapacitations stuff for all three missions this year, so that was exciting!

* I don't have most of the characters' Cute/Pixel achievement sprays yet but I do have it for all of the Support heroes (excluding Baptiste) and to varying degrees across other heroes. I usually spend my time playing in the Arcade so I need to specifically work at achievements if I want them, which I'll do eventually. Even the more luck-based sorts of ones simply take time investment and you'll get them eventually.

* I only have one golden gun so far (Zenyatta). I've been trying to get into playing competitive more though and I've been climbing recently. The dream is to get all golden guns eventually! I'm thinking Mercy and Symmetra for my next two.

* I'm missing most OWL skins but do have all of them for Zen (excluding Washington Justice, that's the last one I need) and misc. for others heroes. I do actually want all of them eventually, but currently I'm mostly just slowly working at them through getting free tokens from the streams.

* I have Widowmaker Noire, Nano Cola D.Va and all of the associated sprays/icon(s), Bastet Ana and all of the associated sprays/icon(s)/pose, Pink Mercy and all of the associated sprays/icon(s). I have Demon Hunter Sombra, Pacific and Atlantic Tracer and Genji + Lucio and Mercy. I do have the Origins skins. I have the Ashe Twitch drop sprays and the Overwatch League season 1 Grand Finals Twitch drop sprays. I have Kerrigan Widowmaker and the Tracer and Torbjorn emotes/voicelines (and sprays) for purchasing Battle of Azeroth for WoW. 

* I do have all of the gray OWL skins that were available last year, from both the All Access Pass and cheering bits. I do have Lucio's Dance Party emote.

---

The only items I'm missing, then, aside from what I described above, are the following:

- Blizzcon Bastion

- Blizzcon Winston

- The Diablo 20th anniversary sprays

- Sprays or player icons for participating in seasonal events or competitive seasons prior to when I had the game, and all sprays/etc. for Top500 anything

I'll never be able to get the Diablo sprays. Back then I didn't know this game existed and would never have had it yet, and they're almost certainly never coming back. The competitive seasons/event stuff of old I'll never be able to get, either, though I don't stress over it. 

I do intend to work on getting the Blizzcon skins, however! I purchased Noire Widowmaker on eBay and will do the same with these two. Whenever I'm able to safely save up the money for them, that is. It'll probably be a while...",1559347502

Currently, you cannot legally own a firearm if you have a criminal record or are mentally unstable. There are also fees and 9 month waiting periods for ownership of suppressors, short barreled rifles, explosives, and fully automatic machineguns. Additionally, no civilian can own a fully automatic machinegun manufactured after 1986 (except for in Alaska, in which federal agents attempting to enforce these laws can be arrested by local law enforcement). I think the fees and waiting periods for suppressors and short barreled rifles should be lifted, but keep fees and waiting periods for explosives and full auto machineguns, alongside lifting the 1986 machinegun manufacturing ban.

I am currently waiting on the background checks and tax stamps for a short barreled rifle and suppressor, but if there was a special permit put in place that lasted X number of years that made such items easier to acquire, without having some sort of national database of firearms and firearms devices, I would be okay with that too.

"sexover30","t5_34cdl","This is a seriously unnecessary overreaction. The overwhelming majority of humanity has vanilla sex and does just fine. In fact vanilla sex folks are the dominant group in society. 

To take that point a bit further, no group of people has ever tried to make sex between a man and a woman illegal, unless it was a white woman with a non-white man, and guess who did that, yup vanilla folks. Vanilla folks have also made things like oral or anal sex illegal, between consenting, heterosexual adults! Vanilla folks also have placed intense, consequence-generating stigmas on same-sex relations, bdsm, role-play, group sex, non-monogamy, pornography (which they also tried to outlaw), and a host of other non-vanilla acts or orientations. Non-vanilla people have never done anything to oppress their vanilla counterparts. 

This is akin to the white person saying there should be a white history month (why, when they get their history celebrated every day), or straight people complaining there‚Äôs no heterosexual pride parade (ditto). It‚Äôs ridiculous, narcissistic, and tone-deaf. 

Places like this emerge in response to the oppressive tendencies of the dominant group. Forums that claim to be sex-positive tend to not be vanilla precisely because vanilla folks don‚Äôt give people other spaces to freely talk about their sex lives. In fact, most vanilla folks have no desire to discuss sex at all. Why would they? It‚Äôs the same basic routine every time. What‚Äôs to discuss. 

The problem begins when they start browsing places such as this, and see other people celebrating a life that does not mirror their own, and lo and behold, suddenly they feel oppressed. 

Vanilla sex is celebrated everywhere in western society. Even on this very sub. There is no need to  go out of your way to celebrate something that is the norm. The fact that it is the norm implies its celebration. 

This is a disappointing post. And I have nothing against vanilla sex. But the idea that there is an anti-vanilla bias on a sex based Internet forum *and that it is a bad thing* is just absurd. 

Exalt, vanilla-sex enjoyers! The entire western world is a celebration of you and your sexual choices. 

Also, vanilla is my favorite ice cream.

About 2 months ago I had this thing where I had a minor pain in my chest.  It was very very localized, I still have it sometimes but I've accepted that it's muscular.  I think it caused me to start obsessing over my heart, to the point that I would monitor my heartbeat very closely.

You must be forgetting 2018, where Sprint had customers leaving in droves. And that was with their free year promo.


&gt;Sprint finished its fiscal 2018 with just under 54.5 million subscribers, which is below the 54.6 million users from its fiscal 2017.
https://investorplace.com/2019/05/sprint-earnings-s-stock/amp/

Think about that. Sprint offered a free year of service hoping to lure new customers who would stay because of the great service and pricing is and they lost over 100,000 subscribers.



&gt;And no offense but tmobile is not some highbrow carrier


Who gives a shit if TMobile is a highbrow carrier?  This attitude  is the biggest problem with wireless in the U.S., and it's 100% consumer driven. I've had friends, family, and coworkers spending an average of $100 a month per phone vs my wife and I spending $38 per phone. Meanwhile we all had steady, consistent service, we had more data, and higher speeds. But muh ATT / Verizon, what of I go on vacation 18months from now to BFE, what bout deprioritization. Me: I'm sure your Facebook posts, Words w/ Friends and texts will be fine.

If you look at this objectively, where is the evidence that this will lead to a feature-based subdivision of module pricing? There is none.

One of my favorite restaurants has customers grill their own meat and vegetables at their table and you're given a pair of tongs to handle your food with... except it grosses me out to use those  tongs to pick up the finished product!! No way do those  tongs get hot enough to kill bacteria between 1) putting meat on the grill and 2) picking it up. So I'll use the tongs to put the meat on the grill and flip it, and my fork/chopsticks/another set of tongs to retrieve the meat once done. At home I'll put meat on the stove, flip it, and then get a new utensil to handle it afterwards.

But for stuff like veggies or pasta I'll use the same utensil.",1559347509

I'm not a contortionist, but I have seen people do some insane shit that seems to defy the limits of the human body. 

again, it might be possible. I doubt it would be comfortable and, if they were even capable, it would probably come with a severely cramped neck. it would probably be like licking your elbow : I can only do it if I move my arm a certain way and stretch my tongue, and even then it's just barely. could they bring themselves to orgasm? probably not. 

I'm not saying that being a contortionist means you can put your whole face between your legs and go to fucking town. now, I'm mobile and won't be able to get on a computer until next week and I don't know how to put links in using the app, but you can look up daniel Browning Smith who has the title of most flexible man and looks like he might be capable of sucking at least a portion of his own dick and zlata who is the most flexible woman as far as I can tell. again : any actual attempts by a contortionist would likely result in a cramped neck and require an outstretched tongue to make contact. lol.",1559347511

This doesn't even make much sense as a scam, but how do you know the authorities where there asking about you? What authorities exactly, did they leave a business card or something? Did room mates speak to them?

This would be basically for something the size of a standard letter, so what kind of customes fees would be due over a simple letter? ID for a letter. over email? What was the email address you sent this too, I'm betting its not a real DHL email. If anything you would present ID when picking up the package not by sending an email. You could have just used a fake ID for the email.

This may all just be coincidence, how long ago did you place the order? Does the vendor mention using DHL in their listing? Did you try contacting the vendor, did you dispute the order or leave feedback to warn others?

B) Don't be afraid of early risks. Your HP is a resource you can spend to upgrade your deck and get relics. If you are ending the first boss with 40 HP, that's HP you could have spent upgrading at a campfire or paying for an event reward.",1559347515

This needs to be emphasized so much in these conversations. Additionally, the more we emphasize instances of false accusations acting as though they‚Äôre the norm, the more we reinforce structures that overwhelmingly favor the dignity of the accused over the dignity of the accuser. 

Not only does it make juries and cops less likely to listen to real victims, it makes victims question themselves: ‚Äúwell, I feel traumatized and x y z indicate I did not consent...but I could be wrong or missing some detail that makes this not really a rape and if there are doubts I don‚Äôt want to risk ruining someone‚Äôs life over them. so I‚Äôm just going to get over it and accept that if I‚Äôm ever really raped I won‚Äôt have any doubts‚Äù *cue years of trauma reinforcement and a massive delay in seeking psychological or legal help*",1559347516

As you can likely tell from this thread, a lot of people really liked Jane as Thor.  I'm guessing her fans also include the editors at Marvel as they've handed her another AAA creative team in Al Ewing and Cafu.  My god, she's gone from Jason Aaron to Al Ewing.  Might as well get used to Jane being a thing because, somehow, the new creative team is just as good as the old one.

"Archero","t5_103ahr","&gt;Well, if you just want to look at the pure stats that either upgrade provides, it is actually not that big of a difference

&amp;#x200B;

That's the whole question. Nobody argues that attack speed offer different benefits as well, but it's hard to weigh pros and cons of each ability and to give a compelling answer as to which one is better than the other without we know what each ability does in terms of pure dps.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;an easy and significant one would be critical hits, with more attack speed. you obviously proc critical hits more often

&amp;#x200B;

But with bonus damage you crit harder. Without numbers, all we can say is that the dps will be more ""stable"" with attack speed bonus compared to the damage bonus.

And this same mechanism applies also for poison and burn and lightning effects, because they're all dependent on your base attack damage, so you can't just brush off the bonus damage option like that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;higher attack speed is also more effective at keeping the melee monsters at bay, especially when they come in swarms.

Yes, that is an undeniable benefit, that might or might not be decisive to choose attack speed over damage.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In terms of utility, attack speed is definitely ahead of damage

It's quite problematic to strictly separate damage and utility, because maximizing dps is a pretty strong strategy in order to survive and cope with swarms of mobs as well for example. If you rely on knockback and slowing down mobs but you hit less hard, you might need to attack move and run around the map in order to not get hit and you lose even more dps in the process, while some pure dps strats can allow you to stand your ground and eliminate the attackers more safely.",1559347522

The HTC is part of the WTO, and it's a set of guidelines for what's what. Nafta doesn't deal with how to conduct electronic trade very much, and Nafta is a lot more than a couple prices for taxes. It guides how you can use products, how IP laws work between the countries, how you can sue companies, etc etc and this stuff has been debated in the past. It wasn't a huge problem but moving into the future it was going to get worse and we needed a new Nafta.

[https://www.cfr.org/blog/coming-north-american-digital-trade-zone](https://www.cfr.org/blog/coming-north-american-digital-trade-zone)

&gt;In 1992, when NAFTA was signed, the World Wide Web had yet to become truly world-wide and the iPhone was still fifteen years away. Thus, it is not surprising that an update was needed to bring the free trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States into the twenty-first century.  
&gt;  
&gt;First, this is the very first ‚Äúdigital trade‚Äù chapter in a trade agreement of which I am aware. This is a semantic change‚ÄîU.S. free trade agreements have included an ‚Äúelectronic commerce‚Äù chapter since the 2003 Singapore agreement. But where ‚Äúelectronic commerce‚Äù might lead some to think only of goods and digital products sold online, ‚Äúdigital trade‚Äù seems to invoke a broader set of economic activities‚Äîfrom the services offered by Baidu and Google to internet-powered medical or other professional services. The World Trade Organization, which has long had a work program in electronic ecommerce, might take note.  
&gt;  
&gt;Second, and more importantly, the United States convinced Canada and Mexico to accept an ‚ÄúInteractive Computer Services‚Äù provision whereby internet platforms are not held civilly liable for the actions of their users. Eric Goldman has [noted](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2018/10/good-news-usmca-a-k-a-nafta-2-0-embraces-section-230-like-internet-immunity.htm) how closely the relevant USMCA text hews to the Communications Decency Act‚Äôs Section 230.  
&gt;  
&gt;Third, the chapter has unenforceable provisions favoring open government data provided in machine readable format, as well as risk-based cybersecurity approaches.

This is exactly where more biotechnology knowledge is helpful. Glyphosate interrupts an amino acid synthesis pathway that simply does not exist in humans. We cannot synthesize aromatic amino acids (well, we can convert phenylalanine to tyrosie but the former must be ingested).

Well I agree that it may not be 100% genuine insofar as their true personalities are concerned. They're definitely encouraged to ham it up to stand out (like everyone else in the entertainment business). However, I disagree that every action they take has been meticulously choreographed (i.e. a team behind the scenes telling them ""when I give you the signal behind the camera, Girl #1 licks Girl #2's hand and Girl #2 licks that same spot""). So in summary I (1.) Don't think it's a performance (at least not to the extent you're proposing) and (2.) It is genuine in the way that the actions the girls are taking are of their own volition and not pre-choreographed.

&gt; hide their romantic relationships but to me that's a clear indicator that the masterminds (for lack of a better term) behind the scenes are trying to fool the followers and have them believe it's all real and not just characters they play for the band

This I mostly agree with. However, I'm of the opinion that a large part of this is just companies not wanting to deal with the blowback from more ""dedicated"" fans. In this area, I admit the east is definitely more sketchy than the west. But you can see situations like when Bieber first started dating and kind of understand why the companies may not want to deal with that + keep the money from those people rolling in.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I just got out of it and the movie was an amazing amount of fun.

I will say that I actually think the human story falls in line with most godzilla movies. There was the faction that wanted to co exist with godzilla, the faction that wants to kill godzilla, and the faction that wants to ""control"" godzilla. at the end of the day I'm pretty sure the eco terrorists didn't want to just kill the world and start new, they wanted to kill the world and remake it in their own image liked Ghidorah wanted to, instictively. If you watch alot of the Heisei era godzilla films it's basically like this film was. Now the humans interactions with godzilla was showa like but the plot was very Heisei like.

&gt;!now the post credits scene with Ghidorah's head was pretty terrifying considering they just have to jolt him to life and he can regenerate rapidly, and considering he almost killed godzilla twice it's pretty scary to think he'll come back.!&lt;

Overall I think this movie is worth the money to see it. While the story may not be ""good"" I think it sets up the monsterverse quite well.",1559347524

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","We started dating when I was very young, and I'm talking about me being 12 years old when we first got together. It was a two year age difference, but for us it didn't matter of course. We started dating just four months after we first met. We were genuinely in love, and this wasn't the type of stupid middle school relationship that lasts for two weeks, oh no. We were mad in love, and I definitely knew she was the one. I knew for sure she was my soulmate. We were so perfect for each other. I practically grew up with her loving me and me loving her. Our relationship was such a beautiful thing. The time I spent with her was the happiest times of my life, and with her I felt so many new emotions and feelings I never felt before. It was an extraordinary time of love, exploration, and just pure happiness. Our relationship was just so intimate, it was crazy. It was somewhat of a long distance relationship- she lived an hour away, but we saw each other maybe once every three months due to her being busy in high school and having a strict father. Our parents also never knew about this relationship, we only kept it to ourselves and friends because we were scared they wouldn't let us hang out if they had known.

Anyway, time passes and it's the summer of 2018. We've been dating for two years, but I noticed her being more irritated at me despite me not doing anything bad on purpose. Of course I would never want her to get mad at me, so whatever I did was not intentional. Eventually she said that she wanted a break from me. Not a break up, but just a break. Of course I did not want this to happen and I was scared as hell, but I tried to do what needed to happen in order for her to clear her mind and go back to being okay with me. A while passes and she says that the break is over, so of course I'm happy about that. This is around the end of August. The beginning of September goes well, and she even told me at some point during that time that she loved me the most she ever has, and that she promised to never leave me. We had promise rings. But something changed between mid-September and late October. She goes back to becoming more irritated at me. A few times she had said ""I'm done"" and ""I'm out"" when becoming mad at me, but she always regretted saying it in the morning, apologized, and said it's not true. She didn't want to say she wanted to break up with me. But that's not what happened on the night of November 10th, 2018. She texted me saying she thinks that we should break up because she can no longer provide what I want from her, and she can no longer commit to a relationship. She said that she didn't want to be apart forever. She said she'd come back when she's ready; ""Maybe in a few months, maybe in a year..."" She wanted time to experiment with other people. Honestly I was just absolutely ripped apart in the most foul way. I never wanted this to happen. I had planned so much for our future. We both had. I thought of our wedding and our future life together almost every day. It was something I was just so looking forward to because I didn't really have anything else to look forward to. She was everything to me; she was my life. I was just not okay at all, I cannot stress that enough. The pain I went through is unimaginable. Time passes and it's January of 2019. She tells me she doesn't want to get back together with me anymore, and that she has fallen out of love with me completely. I felt like the breakup was happening all over again, and the pain came once more. It was even stronger than what I had felt before because now she had told me it was over for good. I was clinging on what she had said about coming back to me after the breakup. It was what kept me going, but now that was gone. Everything was taken from me. From February 21st, 2016, to November 10th, 2018. Our relationship: two and a half years of bliss.

Now it's May, 2019. I'm 15 years old and she is now 17. She has a girlfriend. I still love her the same as I ever did, and I still feel the same way as I did when she broke up with me. I'm too scared to tell my therapist about this because I don't want my parents to get involved, but the pain and torture I go through every day is just so unhealthy. I don't know what to do. It has been six months- half a year- and I still feel just as hurt. I think it just is getting worse. Ever since she breakup, everything has just been a blur. I don't remember much anymore. I feel like this will mess up my life. Nothing will ever be as beautiful as what we had. I feel like I will never feel as happy as I did with her. For some reason I still believe she will come back someday. I just feel it somewhere inside of me, and I don't want to let that feeling go. I don't want to let her go, and I don't think I can.",1559347524

No two people have the same set of experiences throughout life, and we are each much more than a single action or attribute.

Don't forget to look at some simple floor shots as they can be incredible.

Then, spend time in training doing your moves and asking people to take pics of you so you can see what looks best. Play about with hand placements etc.

On the day, bring some print out pictures (either of you doing the move or an insta shot) which ideally you'd have stuck on some kind of mood board. Number them - don't leave all the hardest ones til the end. Have a few backup poses in case you have extra time or a move doesn't work for you.

The second sentence has me believing that Shawn and Cam's relationship is as strong as iron, relying on each for emotional strength and guidance for a while (I would mention the twelve year dad absent at the start to clear this up) if not a very long time.

Then the next paragraph you say he's prepared to leave his brother behind. Then later on you mention Cam is in love with his brother's girlfriend. This doesn't sound like a strong relationship. Seems contradictory from what you previous established.

I would also be a little more specific of why Shawn is in a rut and what's so bad about the staying where they grew up. Is living in the suburbs that bad? You mention it's sleepy and that to me translates to boring. Is that a bad thing? Enough to cause enough of a conflict to drive the entire story?

Also, this day in age, with the debt and job insecurity, college is certainly not the end all be all it used to be. The vagueness of why the town is so bad leaves me wondering why college is so important that he's willing to give up his family and potential romantic relationship (ignoring the whole 'it's his brother's girlfriend thing') to pursue it.

Isnt enough to mock us by making a new character called Cetrion that uses Rains bubble ,or give scorpion a variation that uses Takedas chain whip moves ,or give Kitana Milenas sai ..? and now you give Shang Tsung moves that make him into our favorite characters that you didnt even bother putting into the game (as a sole character, because the moves are pretty much in there...) because you needed space for mundane guest chars..?! Not to mention the tower consumables and how annoyingly they remind us of our misfortune... They even managed to fit fucking Kintaro in there!

See, I recently got into the darker side of tumblr and, well, let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm something beginning with F and halfway to becoming an animal rapist. One of my fur-friends on tumblr introduced me to vore and I was instantly hooked. It escalated quickly; I was soon unable to cum without voring something first. I started with small objects, the stapler, my daughters teddy bear. Next it was furniture, I ate most of the chairs in the house before starting on the sofa. I had to explain myself to start with but by the time the bed disappeared my wife began to think something was up. It was at this moment it dawned on me. In order to achieve the perfect vore I had to eat my wife. I didn‚Äôt waste any time. She had taken the kids to school so I knew we would be alone when she got back. I waited and when she returned I vored her instantly. She had barely walked through the door by the time she started being digested. I enjoyed it so much I did the same to my kids when I picked them up.
What could I do from a legal perspective here? I live in Colorado so if you can let me know if they have any sort of legal exceptions when it comes to vore that‚Äôd be great.

Personally, I'm considering a move to Nevada / Texas after I wrap up my current position, as the RE market in LA is ridiculous (as you say, min $650k for a decent condo). I could buy an amazing house in a nice neighbourhood in Vegas or just outside of Austin for half of that (or a third in the case of Vegas).

Re: car in the short term - I was driving a beat up 01 Corolla until a couple of years ago. I was in a similar position - the car runs fine (it's a Toyota!), so why upgrade? cars are just a tool to get from A to B. I moved to LA for a well paying job, and eventually decided I could afford a nicer car, so I checked the market. I ended up getting an Audi A3 on a lease - it only came to $340 a month. (Sold the Corolla on ebay for about $2k). You can get very attractive lease deals. It was one of the best decisions I made. Driving is actually fun now for me, and it doesn't make a significant dent on my FIRE plan. I don't think it helped my dating life (luckily I met someone who isn't into material things like a lot LA girls are), however I've been working as an executive at a tech company so coming to work in a decent car does help me feel like I'm properly representing the company to the employees that work under me. People are less rude to me on the road (LA is such a driver's city). And I enjoy the benefits of driving in a luxury car (even if it's a base model like the A3). So my recommendation is that with your salary, you should treat yourself to a nice new car.",1559347536

"Romania","t5_2qm35","&gt;agricultura

Ce inseamna investitul in agricultura cand marea majoritate a pamanturilor sunt acumulate de baietii care au avut relatii dupa revolutie, si date in arenda unor companii straine? Cum arata investitul in agricultura? Locuri de munca nu o sa fie create decat sa le numeri pe degete, banii o sa fie cheltuiti pe utilaje care o sa creasca productia, nu numarul locurilor de munca.

&gt;infrastructura si transport

Perfect, de unde scoti banii? Taxele au fost scazute de pesedei, cheltuielile au fost crescute de pesedei. 

Odata ce statul incepe sa arda bani, nu mai poti opri focul ala, decat daca esti dispus sa fii partidul care renunta la urmatorul ciclu electoral spre binele tarii, chiar daca prostimea nu o sa inteleaga treaba asta.

&gt; pune taxe uriase pe materia prima exportata

De ce?

&gt;scade taxele pentru produsele finite exportate

Ok, idee buna, chiar daca economia noastra e bazata pe servicii(48%), nu industrie(29%).

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I have two (soon 3) girls and I've already prepared my husband that I will have almost this exact conversation with my daughters--that sex should be fun for both parties and that she should do her own ""homework"" on her body to find out what she likes.

Boys masterbate and we don't blink an eye, but girls are encouraged to.not touch themselves. It's no wonder that when it's time to engage in sex with a partner, girls leave the experience unsatisfied. 

Young women then enter into sexual relationships where their concern is how the other person is feeling instead of themselves. Why not teach a girl to speak up and take charge of her own pleasure? It would likely lead to more healthy communication between our kids about sex, and then it's something fun for all involved. Why should it make you feel uncomfortable to know that your wife wants to enjoy sex, and wants your daughter to enjoy sex? We want our girls to be more empowered than we were, and to stop settling for some guys jizz on our stomachs... We want to come too!

ETA: If it's a secret that your wife wants orgasms, and wants to be in charge of her sexuality, I think that's a bigger problem in your marriage... Right? Maybe talk to your wife about that, because you gained some valuable insight into how your wife views sex. It may lead to a lot more sex for you... IJS...",1559347536

I mean it would close the distance faster, but I don't think we've seen flak weapons or capital ships dodging missiles so, speed of projectile seems unimportant. And generally missiles have larger range than regular guns, so more than we've seen a hyperspace jump.
Actually on that point, since you'd have to hit them while entering hyperspace a fighter using hyperspace ram would have relatively short range, wouldn't it? Since they don't take long or much room to jump 

The supremacy had shields, but the supremacy was hit by the Raddus. We've seen capital ships crash into each other with shields and tear through the shields, so it doesn't necessarily show us how hyperspace cramming works on shields. 

That's true about temporarily taking it out, but it factors into the cost of a hyperspace ram. Not worth as much to disable for a few minutes as to destroy.",1559347540

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;Either they have a lot more **young kids** who bought a PlayStation for multiplayer than I thought

That's a weird flex. It's not like playing multiplayer on a console is unusual. Here's some reasons why I play multiplayer on PS4.

1. I don't own a PC.
2. I have no interest in owning a gaming PC, because PC components are ridiculously expensive where I live, and importing would mean I'm not covered by consumer acts or even basic warranties.
3. I only really dabble in multiplayer, and mostly the FPS flavour of the month.
4. Everyone I know bar two people plays on PS4, and my two Xbox friends don't play online.

At the end of the day, price increases suck, but a cost increase for an online gaming subscription isn't as big of a deal as the price of petrol skyrocketing or rents being unaffordable. That's probably why Sony get away with it, but it's easy to shrug off an extra $4 a month compared to an extra $50 a week on the grocery bill.

The most annoying thing about PS+ (and NSO) is that they lock cloud saves behind it. That's as much of a motivation to pay for it as the online play. At least with Xbox that feature isn't locked behind Gold and time-limited. But Sony dominated this generation, and people cheered it on, so this is what we get.",1559347541

It's okay to have that - they are a valid part of the community. However, if that's all that's shown, then it becomes a burdensome image.

It's the same with Asians. Previously, we have had only a few stereotypes to choose from - wise, old marital artist, gay-ambiguous loud foreigner, or nerdy feminine student.

Some people, who have been taunted because of these probably are irked when they see them in current media. The damage these images did is still around.

Somehow she manages to steal the most important piece of machinery in the building, which the villains need to achieve their ridiculously moronic plan, and casually walks out the front door with no interference. Why? Because the script needs her to.

Because of this, my back was (and still is) in meh condition, and my hard mattress wouldn‚Äôt cut it. I switched to the newly remodeled guest bedroom in my house, which my dad took great pride in being ‚Äòmodern,‚Äô despite it looking like it was from the 80s. 



As I was moving my wires and chargers and whatnot, my dad came in. I was obviously not in the greatest of moods from the back pain, so the conversation went like this:



‚ÄúHow do you like the brand new room?‚Äù


‚ÄúA bit old for my taste.‚Äù


‚ÄúDid you move the dresser?‚Äù


‚ÄúYes, me, with my lumbar puncture, maniacally moved the three hundred pound dresser to spite you. Mwahhaha.‚Äù


‚ÄúYou seem to have gotten quite an attitude.‚Äù


‚ÄúI mean, you can move it back yourself. Maybe when it falls on you, the ER can give us a family plan.‚Äù

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","&gt;It's not compromising any performance gains lol, every game that's added so far has added it as an option. It's there if you have the power to run it and want the shadows and lighting to look nice.

Yet we've seen the ""rtx ON"" gag countless times by now and the meaning we can derive is it's not the most impressive feature to hit gaming yet. Ya it gives a little extra depth but I wouldn't trade that for frames. 

&gt;Did you look at any of the examples I posted? The Quake 2 one is pretty damn impressive. If you're still stubbornly referring to the HL2 one, then idk what to tell ya man. That's a bad example.

I checked out quake 2.... it's cool but it's not really transformed. It looks a little less flat and has tons of saturation of red.... am I supposed to be blown away by a 20+ year old game with some extra color saturation? Brutal Doom looks awesome compared to that. 

&gt;That said, you should really check out how Metro handled ray tracing, they did a fantastic job. 

I saw this link https://youtu.be/yPySV5C1i24 . Ya, a little extra pop in some areas, but nothing I'm over the moon about, again. 

&gt;That makes even less sense. I have no idea what you are talking about, and I'm not sure you do either.

I'm just saying unity gets shit on at times because the way people make games  in it. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in game design, I've just heard things here and there. 

&gt;Only a 20fps drop on a 2080ti is really good considering this is first generation ray tracing.

 I'd love to see a generation of games where frame drops aren't a thing that has to be mitigated with vsync.

&gt; I just don't want people dismissing ray tracing as a gimmick. It's expensive, but it's not a gimmick.

For the price people are paying for it, with what I've seen, it's a gimmick. This isn't like photo - realism, this is making objects and environments shine a bit more. It's a small bump in the road of graphics for now to me. Several generations of ray tracing in, maybe it'll be worth a look. But now? What is there to really see?",1559347545

Except landing by one punch doesn't often mean a ""round won"", especially not in the case we're talking about, where the fighter landing literally one or two more punches is also the fighter who is known not to sit on his punches and is fighting a heavy handed fighter.

When you're constantly outlanding your opponent each round by one, maybe two punches then there's always going to be a good case for your opponent winning those rounds. Again, especially in a case where one boxer can be seen throwing arm punches and the other has a reputation for his heavy hands.

"youtubers","t5_2sj81","One thing I see always see people saying when it comes to growing a channel is ‚Äútrends‚Äù, latch onto trends and produce content for what is currently trending. I really cannot see the point in that unless your aim is to ride waves and cover all manner of topics, rather than focusing on creating content you are passionate about. You seem to be focused on your niche, but then in a niche becomes the trends within whatever topic you are creating about. 

What you do need to do is just focus on doing the best you can, be it thumbnails (not following the trend on those though!), audio quality, whichever. Look at those in your niche and see what you like, but also critically review and see what you would do better. And in terms of the style, I would experiment. You have nothing to lose, and maybe even use it to try and garner feedback and create audience engagement. 

Our channel is just live performances, possibly adding some other stuff related to what we do, but that is the purpose, not doing reaction videos to films, flat earth commentary or whatever else is cool at the moment. Obviously what and how you choose to create is your choice, but you need to know your reason for creating and how you want to create, once you do you can understand how you are going to progress the channel. We don‚Äôt have our channel where we want it to be, but these are the tips I have garnered from all my own research on it, so hope it is of some use.

"FireflyFestival","t5_2u882","As mentioned already, the best method of getting pot through security is to place the bag near areas of your body that they won't grab you during the pat down.  Bring plenty of sandwich bags, and try to minimize any sound or movement they make under your clothes.  

&amp;#x200B;

The clear bag policy ""might"" actually make it easier to hide bags in handkerchiefs or other permissible items if they don't force you to empty the bag out, which has been the standard in the past.  Last year I was denied entry by one person because I had a normal-size backpack with me.  I exited the line, moved to a line on the other side of the gate, and was granted access literally five to ten minutes later by a different guard.  I expect them to be very strict on the bag size limitation this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Security in general has increased year-to-year over the life of this festival.  I don't expect that to change this time.

&amp;#x200B;

The routine last year (for males) was to empty your pockets, remove any hats, raise your shirt to expose your waistband, then slowly turn around.  Drop the shirt and hold your arms out for a quick pocket check and a sweep with the metal detector wand.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing to to note is they tend to try and make an impression on the first day.  Pocket checks were more thorough,   
 they checked the sweatband of my hat, and the pat down was not just a flat palm.  They asked to look inside my pack of gum, and I saw others getting cigarette packs checked.  On my second entry that day, I actually got yelled at and harassed a bit by a security guard because I started to lift my shirt and turn before she commanded me to.  Keep in mind these people are standing in the heat all day and processing greasy, inebriated people.  Be friendly, prompt, and free of prohibited items, and you shouldn't have any problems.",1559347549

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","&gt;So you already acknowledge that the US literacy/mathematics levels and prison incarceration levels are problematic.

I absolutely did not. Saying something is less than ideal is not the same as saying where the problem lies or that they are problems. It's not ideal that murder happens, but it's not problematic that murder happens. It's the cost of living in a free society: some people will use that freedom in dumb ways that result in their freedom being revoked. 

&gt;As an Australian, let me draw some other comparisons. Public Healthcare vs Private healthcare. America's Healthcare system is completely predatory on the poor, an injury or sickness can leave them at the brink of bankruptcy. Compared to Australia and its public heathcare, all health crises are covered by the Government.

I do not at all give two shits about Australia's health care systems. Comparisons are boring and dumb, it doesn't get at any issue you'd like to talk about. I think the American health care system needs more tolerance built into the system for individuals, instead of collective bargaining. I don't know how to do that, I'm not an economist, but I can admit that it's less than ideal. That said, our health care standards are among the highest in the world. The talent within our doctors is unparalleled. It's really foolish to pick healthcare as a topic you want the US to look bad on. 

&gt;Americans have one of the lowest minimum wages and highest income inequality in the world. The minimum wage is $7.25 in comparison to $19 in Australia. This wage is completely unsustainable for many families and even single person households. Furthermore, the discrepancy in earnings between the rich and the poor is staggering, resulting in a significantly high poverty level and homelessness.

Australia has about the same number of people as California. Let's compare your GDP to California's: Australia's GDP ~1.3 trillion. California's GDP ~2.7 trillion. Your entire country does less than half of one state. Even Texas and New York have higher GDP's. So how's all that inflated minimum wage working out for you guys? 

&gt;Americans also have a trillion in student debt. This debt cannot be offset by bankruptcy and once it passes a certain threshold, it can be extremely difficult to pay off due to compounding interest rates. A simple mistake in your late teens can cost you a lifetime of debt. Australia pays off 75% of student loans and the rest remains in interest free debt that you only have to pay if you reach a certain income threshold.

How many Australian universities are in the top 50 globally? Hint, it's 1, and you only broke into the top 50 in 2010. Your models for healthcare, employment and education do not produce better results. 

&gt;Finally, we have Trump. 40-50% of Americans voted for this guy. He denies climate change and you guys voted for him?? He is the icon of sexual harassment and corruption.

I didn't vote for Trump, but our elections have exactly jack shit to do with your nation. You don't get a single vote, and we don't pretend to care about your politics. We know you're irrelevant!

&gt;If you can't see all these problems and still think you're part of this intelligent and great superpower without big problems

I'm not denying any problems, I'm saying that the problems that do exist are massively over-blown because it's trendy among idiots to pretend the US is some shithole. It's not, we're the beacon of humanity, at present. And that's a fact I genuinely hope changes, I wish you and your pathetic school pulled their weight. I wish Australia contributed more to global security. But you don't. You don't pull your weight, then turn around and brag about being able to afford healthcare and student debt. Aircraft carriers are expensive, and if you want global peace, they're necessary. Why don't you vote to play a larger role in global stability, then tell me how much resources are left over for padding minimum wage workers. 

&gt;objectively, I can see you guys are fucked

We already have mixed economy quasi welfare states as opposed to laissez faire capitalism, and are drifting further and further from  laissez faire capitalism and closer to state-run capitalism or some form of democratic socialism.

While capitalism‚Äôs introduction has presented a lot of benefits to countries that were not seen as capitalist, it has done very little to make the country more democratic, and in many ways helped maintain the vastly inequitable distribution of wealth and political freedoms that was present before. 

Capitalism can be great and all, but it is inherently undemocratic and creates a plutocracy if left unchecked, which it is essentially doing at this very moment. 

And, I don‚Äôt mean to insinuate that you are uneducated or anything like that, but I‚Äôm going to assume that you aren‚Äôt all that familiar with the alternative systems to capitalism that have been proposed over the years?

"rutgers","t5_2risk","For the meal plan, it's ultimately up to individual preference. If you see yourself as someone who will regularly eat on campus and almost never make your own meals and/or prefer the convenience of going to dining halls, then I'd go with the max meal plan or the one right below that. With housing, there is a multitude of options like LLCs which are basically dorms for people with shared interests/majors, singles, doubles, apartments, etc. Again, that also depends on your individual preference, and also your budget. Apartments cost more than regular dorms do, so if you want to save some money, opt for the dorms. About the housing deposit, I think it's pretty straightforward. Are you an EOF recipient? If not, then you would have to pay the deposit because you were awarded $20k in financial aid which I do not believe is full financial aid. You answered your question about the open dorms. Concerning the financial aid expansion part, more than likely, no. $20k is a fairly good amount compared to what most people tend to receive. As you are part of a few programs and do work study, that is likely all you will get. You do have the option to apply for school-specific scholarships though.",1559347554

"PleX","t5_2ql7e","On Windows, to check your signal strength you can run the following in a batch file. (.bat).  It makes aiming the antenna really easy too.

Make sure you install the HD homerun software first :[http://download.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun\_windows.exe](http://download.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun_windows.exe)

    @ECHO OFF
    :Loop
    ""C:\Program Files\Silicondust\HDHomeRun\hdhomerun_config"" FFFFFFFF get /tuner0/status
    GOTO Loop

Then you need to tune to a channel in plex and you will see a constant stream of signal strength, bits per second, etc.  Change channels in plex and you will see the strength of the next channel.  You could create a second batch file with /tuner1/status to monitor the second tuner.  You would need to tune to two different channels in plex using either two devices or two browser windows.

Another useful command is this.  The first line sets the channel you want to test.  The second one reads the stream and prints out a series of dots or other characters.  Be sure you are not tuned to a station in plex or it will give an error.

You should see a series of dots. ""n"" indicates network packet loss. ""t"" indicates a reception error.

    ""C:\Program Files\Silicondust\HDHomeRun\hdhomerun_config"" FFFFFFFF set /tuner0/vchannel 2.1
    ""C:\Program Files\Silicondust\HDHomeRun\hdhomerun_config"" FFFFFFFF save /tuner0 null

After you are done, run this command to free up tuner 0.  Otherwise plex won't be able to use it.

Here‚Äôs what you do: hold your wife while she cries, if that‚Äôs what she wants to do.  If you can avoid letting the kids know what is going on, it‚Äôs probably better to do so until you get more information, like what stage it is and where it is in the body.  You need to know the shape of this monster before you can make a plan to knock it down.  

And a plan to knock this fucker down will come together.  It will likely involve surgery, radiation, chemo and possibly hormone therapy.  All of those treatments will exact a toll on your wife.  But that‚Äôs ok - she‚Äôs still going to be the person you married, the one who carried and nurtured your 3 kids, the one you love so much.  She‚Äôs just going to be tired for awhile.  She‚Äôs going to need you.  

Try not to lose your shit.  Not yet.  Breast cancer is very treatable, even in late stages.  If you‚Äôre an ‚Äúanswer guy,‚Äù please learn what you can about breast cancer and the varying pathologies.  It is definitely not a one-size-fits-all diagnosis and once the white coats get this thing under a microscope, you will understand how pathology effects treatment and long-term survival.  

But don‚Äôt think about ‚Äúlong-term survival‚Äù right now.  Just think about survival.  One day at a time.  Minute by minute.  One foot in front of the other.  Don‚Äôt look too far ahead for now.  One day at a time is all we ever get anyway.",1559347554

Still, even with the disagreements between everyone on the matter, ouija boards are used with the intent to contact that which we cannot see or touch. There are indeed cases where someone uses one to contact spirits and activity goes from nothing or very little to very active. Maybe it's not every time, I don't pretend to know all the rules.

\+10% aim damage, +40% VATS crit or +50% limb damage are better options, as they preserve the health of nearby targets.
