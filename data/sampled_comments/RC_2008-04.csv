That's certainly what the Southern Baptists *teach*--James Dobson for example, teaches men that women like to be beaten because it makes them feel morally superior--but I don't accept it. Women who seek help from a SBC minister for domestic violence are generally ""counseled"" to go home and try to be more obedient so they won't get hit as much. That is ministerial abuse, period.

And what about the young girls, who are conditioned to this from toddlerhood? You really think they have a choice to decide if they want to be treated as servants or not?

You think it's not harmful to tell them that's all they are good for, and--if they happen to live in Ghana--raise them to believe that their survival is worthless?

"politics","t5_2cneq","This is one of those topics about which I can draw a fun parallel between the far right and far left. Who else here has noticed that the far left and far right are exactly alike when you look at gun control and teen pregnancy?

The far right believes that if everyone keeps their fun bits to themselves and doesn't indulge in any sex until they're married to someone, and ONLY have sex with that specific someone, STD's and unwanted pregnancy would be eliminated. For the most part, they're right -- there would still be a few cases of STD's transferred by other routes. However, this won't happen in the real world. Nobody's perfect, and people like to have sex. The far left is always quick to point out that this system only works in a perfect world where people don't have to worry about lust or temptation.

When it comes to gun control, the far left believes that outlawing firearms will stop all firearm related crime. After all, you can't use a firearm in a crime if you can't get one. They're largely correct -- if you could find a way to make all firearms illegal and dispose of them, there would be almost no gun crime. There would still be isolated cases of clever criminals fabricating firearms, and the inevitable gun missed by the ban/destruction sweep, but your average Joe Thug probably wouldn't have one. However, this isn't a perfect world, and there is just NO WAY to round up every firearm. Even if the US government could do it, there would be a thriving black market for illegally imported arms. Of course, the far right commonly points this out as a counter-example.

Both arguments are absurd, yet each side staunchly sticks with it.","1207008526"

"reddit.com","t5_6","that is only one example of what you have taken out of context in my posts and responded to erroneously. and because you either can't or don't want to read what i've writeen, i agree, we aren't going to agree. however, if you can turn the reading comprehension on full blast, i think we can work through this.

&gt; Even if there were no codified laws, you co-existing with other people makes this impossible. There’s no way I would ever agree to be ruled by the moral standards you believe in, and eventually it would come to violence. You are not free to push your lifestyle on me, just as I am not free to push my values on you.

now what i said was that there are already laws to guard between one and another individual. i cannot to you and you cannot to me. these laws already exist. and i said it should be that way! however, what i do to me (do heroin by the wheelbarrow) is none of your or the government's business. the moment that someone crosses an individual barrier, they have broken a law that has legitimate place in a governmental structure. however, for those who are their own ward,  a governmental structure has no business dictating any behavior. advise, educate, if the electorate wants it, but treating everyone like criminals because a few people break legitimate laws (with or without legalized drugs) is nonsense.

&gt; unlike you, I think a more moderate, careful, and considered approach to drug legalization is more prudent than legalizing all drugs.

so who decides, and what are the guidelines? is cocaine legal? but heroin probably isn't, right? maybe heroin is, but you are only allowed to smoke it. orr....

can you show me any evidence that any measure of prevention is effective in any tangible way? maybe its out there everywhere and i'm just missing it. 

if so, ok, i guess i'll have to reconsider. but...

i've always been of the impression that whatever drugs make it to a particular location is the amount of drugs that sell in a particular location. whatever it is thats selling, and legal or not.

bah. whatever. neither of us matter anyway.

i will say this: government is a good thing as long as its scope and venue are kept on an interpersonal level. that is, the government operates in the space between people, because it is the thing that binds those people together. 

when government's decisions start to creep into personal freedom to provide desired goods and services it becomes a very bad thing, again, of course, wherever a good or service directly infringes on another individual (say some 7/11 owner was lacing the water with heroin), this is still a crime.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Sounds like fun. We can't keep up all four topics right now, though, would you like to choose one for a detailed discussion?

In the meantime some thoughts in response to your thoughts:

**Fundamentalism** I would argue that there's no such thing as a fundamental atheist since the attribute that defines fundamentalist Christianity is their belief in a fundamental truth which cannot be altered or influenced. Atheists hold no facts to such a standard, and while their may be *extreme* atheists there surely isn't such a thing as an atheist that would deny God's existence if scientific experiment confirmed it.

In other words: the concept of ""fundamental"" atheism is mixed up and confused with ""evangelical"" atheism. In terms of atheism the distinction should be between [strong and weak](http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismquestions/a/strong_weak.htm) or atheist and agnostic, respectively.

To return to your question, though:

&gt; How certain should someone be of what they believe?

However certain they are, as the problem isn't with conviction but how it impacts your actions. Two people could be identically certain of their beliefs yet only one of them goes to an extreme (violence, for example) because of it.

**Indoctrination** It sounds like we agree that strong indoctrination (to the point of so-called brain washing) of a child is morally impermissible but some indoctrination is impossible to avoid. I agree with your conclusion: it's more important to teach children how to question and think critically than it is to ""not indoctrinate.""

**Creationism/I.D.** I'm not a scientist of any kind, either, and even if I was that wouldn't qualify me to know everything about evolution. In the world of science there isn't a field or arena that isn't impacted by the theory of evolution. To go any further, though, we have to get a few things out in the open:

1) Do you believe in the literal truth of the Bible (and in particular the stories of creation in Genesis)?

2) Does the truth or falsity of evolution disprove or prove the existence of God?

3) Are science and religion mutually exclusive?

4) Do you agree that Intelligent Design is no more than another name for religious creationism?","1207008854"

Well, it's pretty easy to get a cup of coffee and exchange ideas.  It's also easy to exchange ideas on IRC with people in other countries.  I don't think the reason for outlawing marijuana is to prevent the free exchange of ideas.  I think the reason is brainwashing (remember DARE from elementary school? talk about propaganda...).

"science","t5_mouw","I read this really good book ""Ancient Mysteries"" I think it was called, it looked at legends and bible stories through the lens of science. If you read it you'll find a convincing argument that many of the Bible's stories *do* have an origin in truth.

The bible's root word biblio means ""book"". It was *the* book, and for millenia that's really what it was to followers of Abraham. If some important shit happened there was only one place to put it to ensure the knowledge would pass down. If you're Abrahamic by blood, these stories are literally the voices of your ancestors. Certainly much has been lost or perverted over time, but it's still one of the best links to that *very real* time that we have. I don't think we should take the Bible as absolute truth, but there is definitely a very real story behind many of the Bible's stories, it's one of the oldest ""history books"" we have, and hell, it's only a little more biased than the ones we get at school.

If you need any more proof, so many of the stories are either simply too bizarre to make up from whole cloth(Jesus and the lazy tree) or otherwise too mundane and meaningless to bother writing down if it wasn't at least based in truth(The very human author is the only one who cares who begat so-and-so and what everyone's kids are up to).


He also convinced me he had figured out where and what ""Atlantis"" truly was in his book, *biig disappointment*  actually, but it's pretty much the only theory that fits with the facts, if you disregard Plato's story as a lunatic rant. You can still go and see ""Atlas' Throne"". Of course, the name ""Atlantis"" comes from Atlas, not the Atlantic Ocean.

Maybe the government got all those families to lie about this? Or maybe they were able to fake all the families too?

&gt; I am not a ""truther"" as you are so quick to label me

I apologize for labeling you something you find offensive. That being said, you've repeated many oft-repeated truther myths that are known to be false. 

&gt; I have learned not to try to change those people's minds who are not receptive to the science aspect of 9/11.

I, unfortunately, haven't learned that, yet. I argue with people like that all the time: the truthers. I'm fairly certain that's not the group you were thinking of, though. My view of the vast majority of truthers is that they only give lip service to the idea of science, and use the term to give their psuedoscientific claims merit.

I'd love to discuss the so-called science behind the 9/11 conspiracy theories. I'm often begging reddit conspiracy theorists to provide me some science, and with one exception, every single one of them has failed to even engage in the discussion.

&gt; If bin Laden is responsible for 9/11, why has the FBI never charged him or included 9/11 with his other charges?

I know you don't want me to answer the question, but luckily, ""they"" already have.

First, the FBI doesn't charge anyone with anything. The reason 9/11 isn't on the WANTED posted is precisely because he hasn't been charged.

The real question I presume you care about is why the DOJ hasn't charged Bin Ladin. They've also answered this. 

The reason Bin Laden hasn't been charged with  the terrorists attack of 9/11 is partially because Bin Laden isn't directly and personally ""responsible"". Personal responsibility falls mostly with the hijackers and Khalid Sheikh Mohammad (and others). 

See here:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7239099.stm


Bin Ladin's role is far less clear and the evidence linking him, personally, and directly to 9/11 isn't ""hard"" (ie, it's confession tapes w/ unknown chain of custody, and so on).

There are some other legal mumbo-jumbo reasons.

Some explanation:

Scientologists are all about controling the legal system and any government institutions in order to hide any wrongdoings. Take a look at the Clearwater police which are [controlled by Scientologists](http://www.sptimes.com/News/032201/Opinion/Police_work_for_Scien.shtml).  How are you going to prosecute if the DA is enforcing fair game? CoS critics in Clearwater are already targetted by the police.

The ruling says they told the court the chopper was at 500 feet, but the court found that was ""not credible"" -- a term known in less polite circles as something between wishful thinking and perjury -- and that the chopper was barely off the ground.

Muslims killed 3000 people one day about 7 years ago. Do we ban Muslims? Protestants executed how many people for blasphemy? Catholics murdered how many people during the Crusades?

&gt;So the Dominionists control communities and kill those who disagree with them, and have had court cases establishing these facts?

Yes, indeed we do. Look up what happened in Salem under Christian theocratic rule in the 1600s. Look at the lynchings all over the South just 40 years ago. Look at the civilians dying in Iraq because of the Dominionists' desire to impose our will on them.

***

Incidentally, you keep moving the goal posts. A common habit of Dominionists, I notice.

First your position was that a religion that does physical and emotional harm should be banned. Now, whatever physical and emotional harm I show you, you say that religion shouldn't be banned because the harm it does is not as bad as Scientology's.

So apparently we can only ban whatever you perceive as the worst religion in the world. So when Scientology is banned, what's next? Will you ban Buddhism then because Buddhism will be the worst to you? Hinduism? 

*****

Also, I'm confused by your claims that people have a choice whether to follow the SBC, but no choice whether to become Scientologists? How exactly does that happen? Is Scientology genetic and SBC not? The decision is somehow made in the womb? Aren't the people who join Scientology just as responsible for their choices as the people who are reared SBC?

The trend (if you can call it that) toward state courts striking out to afford additional rights protections under their individual constitutions generally goes by the name judicial federalism.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Sex education is just that. Educating children about the mechanics and ways of human sexuality. 

And if I don't want to educate my CHILDREN (from your statement) at the same age that you think I should educate my CHILDREN about this, then I just have to give in to your viewpoint?

&gt;It is FACTUALLY based. 

No kidding.  Where in my post did I suggest otherwise.  Don't kill yourself looking.

I'm not arguing about whether it is factually based.  I'm arguing about whether the government gets to teach it to my kids, and when - or whether I get to teach it to my kids when I feel it is appropriate.

Here's a valuable lesson for you - kids do not all mature at the same rate emotionally, mentally and physically.  But as usual, the school is going to apply a one-size-fits all program to each kid - and in reality - miss most of them.

&gt;That you think it is anything but speaks volumes to your mindset. 

That you put words in my mouth that I did not say or imply speaks volumes to your mindset.  Strawman.

&gt;The answer is always more education.

No, it isn't even the question, much less the answer.  The question is WHEN and HOW. I don't want some teacher that may have a different viewpoint about the world teaching my kid about sex at a time that may be sooner than I want to teach my kid about sex.

I'll decide WHEN my child is ready for that conversation and I'll choose what perspective to put that education in based on my life experience.  I don't want Mr. Gym Coach telling my kid what sex is about.

&gt; Your ability to shelter your children from education should not, in fact, be an impediment to their education. They aren't your property. You are merely their guardians.

You don't have kids, do you?  Might I ask how old you are?  Kids are the most awesome responsibility you will ever encounter in this life.  Every decision you make after conception becomes huge and looming.  

Whether you drink during pregnancy. Smoke during pregnancy. Vaccinate for Hep B (an unlikely illness for a newborn) at the hospital at 1 day old - or not.  Vaccinate on the prescribed schedule or not.  Breast feed or not.  Organic foods or not.  How much time you spend with your kid each day...

It goes on and on.  And you will do every one of those things slightly different than your neighbor.

Raising a kid isn't about property, it is about freedom.  This isn't about sex education, it is about freedom.  It is about whether the parent gets to decide how their child is raised or whether the government (who has shown JUST HOW GOOD they are at doing things time and time again /sarcasm) decides how a child is raised.

I can assure you - I have the means and will to see that my child will not be raised by you, the government or a majority.   My son will be raised by me and my wife.

I'll never understand how you would so easily give up your freedom to raise your child the way you see fit because you happen to agree with the majority on one thing and how people don't see the precedent they set when they support ""making everyone do it their way.""

You should look at the big picture.

You raise your kids your way, and let other people raise their kids their way.  What arrogance makes you so sure that you know best how other people should rais their kids?","1207010432"

The second is actual development, here exemplified by some guy writing patches. The guy uses Distro A, cause the system integration guys did a nice job on it. So he goes and he puts his patch in Distro A's system for handling patches. But Distro B wants the guy's patch, since it applies to them just as much. Because all of the guy's work has been published into Distro A's system, Distro B has to go through that system, and thus Distros A and B waste time arguing over who should push patches to whom. If the guy is unsatisfied with this, he starts writing patches for A and B, then congratulations: now the guy is wasting time doing the system integration job that the distros could have been doing for him.

1) The [parent post](http://reddit.com/info/6e2ax/comments/c03lavk) did not mention anywhere that the victim ""deserved it"".  That was a subjective element added by you.

2) The jury acquitted him of murder, which I believe means in this case that they thought that he had *no intent* to murder him, but only *scare* him as the article said.  They believed him to be under a ""extreme emotional distress"" at the time, which clouded his ability to think clearly.  Thus, the lesser charge of manslaughter.  While we might discuss it conversationally as ""murder"", it appears that the local laws do not - it is ""manslaughter"".  (causing the death of another without intent to do so)

You said ""*So murder is alright so long as the victim deserved it?*"", which does not follow from anything in the parent post.  Thus, it is a non-sequitor.

"programming","t5_2fwo","BSD was not originally free. Only with Net/2 in 1991 the first free version appeared (stripped of AT&amp;T code). This was in part because some of the developers were interested in the free software concept as spread by the GNU project (which is curious, given the animosity of the present BSD users towards the FSF) 

The problem was that this release was stalled because of a suit filled by AT&amp;T, only settled in 1994, so 4.4BSD ""Lite"" in 1994 was the first free version not under any legal suspicion.

This came at a delicate time: Linux is from 1991, gained some steam in 1992 with X and in 1994 Linux 1.0 was released. This seems to indicate that the lawsuit came at a really bad time and without it Linux would not exist: reading the newsgroups of the time and the news reports give the impression that GNU was ready to use a BSD kernel, and Linus was driven to write Linux out of frustration with Minix's limitations and lack of alternative.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Yes a few Muslims did that, ask Turkey, a moderate Islamic state about that.

So your claim is that every Scientologist has murdered someone? Why are you so concerned then whether they live or die, if they're all killers?

&gt;That is some pretty far fetched reaching in time and space!

It's ok for a religion to murder someone so long as they didn't do it--what last week? Last month? As long as they do it at least x # of miles from American soil?

Interesting set of ethics you got there.

&gt;But on that note, you do have a choice to join Scientology, but you are denying someone's choice to live when you kill that Suppressive Person in retribution per your religion's doctrine.

You're also denying someone's choice to live when you withhold from them medical information that could save his or her life, simply because you think they might not follow your religion if they knew.

What about the 89 women who have died of ectopic pregnancies in Nicaragua because the religious right there no longer accepts saving the life as the mother as a reason for abortion--even in the case of an etopic pregnancy, which cannot produce a living child and will kill most women if not aborted? How much choice do you think they had? You think sending them home to die of an easily treated medical condition is giving them a *choice*?


You're also denying someone's choice to live when you drop bombs on them for living in an Islamic country. Evangelicals are even now calling for us to bomb Iran unprovoked to start the Rapture. I don't get why it's ok to kill brown people in the name of religion but not white ones?

Ah, but you miss the main point of the Israeli settlement enterprise.  The building of homes in the Palestinian territories (or Judea and Samaria) for Jewish Israelis.  They are outposts of Israeli sovereignty in a sea of non-Jewish Arabs who are excluded from the Israeli electorate.  It's no different than declaring every white in South Africa to be a citizen and every black to be a non-citizen and re-adjusting the borders of South Africa as needed to ensure that the white neighborhood are technically in South Africa while excluding the black neighborhoods.

"programming","t5_2fwo","It's true that Lisp on systems running UNIX or Windows isn't designed for systems programming. Lisp on Lisp Machines, however, was awesome for systems programming. :-)

As for performance, modern Lisp compilers do a really surprisingly good job at allowing you to choose what you care about with respect to performance. That is, Lisp tends to be optimized for writing correct code quickly and making the correct code quick possible; C tends to be optimized for writing incorrect code that crashes quickly and making the quick code correct possible. Which you prefer is, of course, a matter of taste.

Lisp hardly has enough syntax to be called either beautiful or ugly; it mostly just is. Let's put it this way: chances are if you looked at the abstract syntax tree of any other language, you'd think it was ugly, too. In Lisp, you're essentially always working with the abstract syntax tree (cf. macros). To many Lispers, that's a feature, not a bug.

As for an elitist community, absolutely (and I say that as a multi-decade member of that community). Lisp is pretty much the ultimate by-wizards-for-wizards language. That doesn't mean that no wizards use other languages (cf. Peter Norvig or Oleg Kiselyov), but it does mean that few non-wizards (or non-wizards-in-the-making?) choose to use Lisp on an ongoing basis. The fact that the Lisp community, by and large, likes it that way is pretty much the definition of elitist.","1207011984"

The best resume tip I can think of it is do anything you can to avoid having to make one. Find work through your network of friends and relatives and help them find work that way, too, by connecting people who wouldn't otherwise know each other.

No but it is their church's doctrine to do everything including kill to defend themselves from ""suppressive persons"".

&gt; It's ok for a religion to murder someone so long as they didn't do it--what last week?



Doctrines evolve, previously the doctrine of many religions was to kill heathens. When CoS evolves and drops the fair game approach they too can enjoy tax exempt status. 

&gt; Interesting set of ethics you got there.

Indeed. Pretty straight forward but you are bringing up wonderful points.

&gt; You're also denying someone's choice to live when you withhold from them medical information that could save his or her life, simply because you think they might not follow your religion if they knew.

That happened recently in the USA and child protective services ripped the remaining kids away from the family, as they should have done. The family figured they could pray in order to heal their terminally ill child. That may happen outside the USA and that is wrong although outside of USA jurisdiction.


Dropping bombs on Islamic countries is stupid, as a liberal liberal myself I can't agree wit hthat. Although people subvert their religion to justify it, the religion doesn't support that. L Ron Hubbard, talks about it, but more importantly his believers follow it, it is part of the CoS right now, there isn't any debate within the CoS. Vs the Christians - some of them err on the side of peace, others err on the side of war.  Killing in Iraq is not directly related to a church's doctrines although many churches support it.

If I remember correctly from the article, the example given was the C17. The article gave a list of almost 20 languages used by different vendors for different systems, and discussed the issues with getting everything talking. 

I think this has largely been solved by standards for things we take for granted now like network protocols (the OSI model was developed by the DOD to address the same concern from a networking standpoint). But at the time they saw the need to make a language that would be used for everything so they would never have to worry about things being able to talk to each other.

The government also evicted many Americans, including mobsters (who, in collaboration with Batista, ran the gambling casinos in Havana)) from the island. Some of these measures were undertaken by Fidel Castro's government in the name of the program that he had outlined in the Manifesto of the Sierra Maestra.

Since Cuba became a declared socialist republic in 1961, the United States Government has initiated various policy measures against Cuba's government, applying standards on Cuba which some believe it did not apply to countries with arguably equally poor human rights records. These measures have had a considerable political and economic effect on the island; these have variously been designed to encourage Cubans to remove the leadership and to undertake political change towards liberal democracy. The most significant of these measures was the United States embargo against Cuba and the subsequent Helms-Burton Act of 1996. The US government, its supporters and other observers contend that the Cuban government does not meet the minimal standards of a democracy, especially through its lack of multi-party contests for seats and the limitations on free speech that limit a candidate's ability to campaign. The Cuban government, its supporters and other observers within and outside Cuba argue that Cuba has a form of democracy, citing the extensive participation in the nomination process at the national and municipal level.

"business","t5_2qgzg","This is a pretty standard ploy by government.  If the government fails, it demands more responsibility and power.  If a business fails, in true capitalism, that's it, it dies, clearing the way for more effective leadership.

And in general the media goes idly by, calling schemes like this ""modern"" and about ""stability,"" when in fact it's a simple power grab, and all this could have been avoided with the powers the Fed previously had, had they simply raised the interest rates.

Some will argue which was more important, the rates vs. the oversight, but clearly they have a responsibility to set the rates, and they performed poorly in doing so.  From [good ole 2003](http://money.cnn.com/2003/06/24/news/economy/fed_walkup/):

&gt; the Fed has cut the fed funds rate 12 times since the start of 2001, to a 41-year low of 1.25 percent.

&gt; Other, longer-term rates have also tumbled to historic lows. Most important, **mortgage rates are lower than ever, encouraging a boom in housing that's helped homeowners feel wealthier and allowed people to refinance mortgages at lower and lower rates, putting more cash in their pockets**.

[A similar story](http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8954621_ITM) from the same time:

&gt; The Federal Reserve Board did its part to help Johnson and other homebuyers, [by] cutting interest rate[s]. The move indirectly will help keep mortgage rates near historic lows, and perhaps push them lower. It also should alleviate concerns that the housing market could slip from its comfortable perch.","1207012340"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Yes, I have children. I will teach them everything I can, as soon as possible, about everything I know.


Come on now.  One way or another this has to be a problematic statement. What do you mean by ""as soon as possible?""

Do you mean, ""as soon as you think they are ready?""  If so, then what if the school decides they are ready before you do?

If you really mean ""as soon as possible"" as in ""as soon as you think they might possibly understand it"" then more power to you - but I don't want you choosing when MY kids learn about sex ed.

&gt;Guess what? I don't know everything. And neither do you. 

That's my point.  I KNOW that I don't know everything, thus I don't believe that I should tell other people when and how to educate their children about sex.

And I don't want other people telling ME when and how to educate MY kids about sex.

&gt;You already get to educate your children the way you see fit. That is the starting point. The JOB of the government is to make sure that ALL children get educated, regardless of the parental situation.

We differ greatly here.  I see the job of government is to OFFER education to all children.  It is the job of the PARENT to choose when and how that child is educated.

And with the exception of a rather controversial ruling in California right now, I believe most states allow you to homeschool your children - which re-inforces MY viewpoint of the government's job when it comes to education.

They provide it, but you are free to take their version or provide your own.  You also - of course - have the right to send your child to a private school of your choosing.  Which again supports my view of the government's role in education - to provide it, not forcibly deliver it.

&gt;Your position that the government has no business educating your children about sex because you think that it is your job is nearsighted. 

I disagree for all the reasons I stated above.  YOU can let the government educate your kids about sex, but I choose to do that myself.  The difference is that you seem to be ok with forcing your viewpoint on me, while I am content to raise my kids the way I see fit and let you raise your kids the way you see fit.

&gt;What do you think would happen if we just said ""okay, from now, the government is out of the education business""? Yes, I'll let others raise their kids their way. As long as they reach minimum standards for educating their children. Or is failing to educate your child your right as a parent?

I never said that or even implied that. I've said all along that it is your right as a parent to decide WHEN and HOW your child is educated about sex.","1207012458"

""Economist Ofer Azar recently came up with a novel way to study the insidious nature of the action bias. He examined whether soccer goalies were more likely to stop penalty kicks when they dived to the left, dived to the right or stayed in the center of the goal. In a study of 286 penalty kicks faced by elite Israeli goalkeepers, Azar found that goalies had the best chance of stopping a kick when they remained in the center -- partly because when they dived to one side, they left themselves with no chance of stopping a kick aimed at the other side or a kick aimed dead center. And even when they correctly guessed the direction of the kick, they still had only a 1-in-4 chance of stopping a goal. ""","1207012483"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; We're not talking about tax exemption. This got started because you called for an outright ban.

I talked about not granting religious status which means no tax exemption, that doesn't mean the CoS is banned. Churches make a killing off of that, a pastor can make $20k/year and do just as well as someone making $50k/year.

&gt; Your claim is that unlike the SBC, where opinion might be divided, all Scientologists support killing people who disagree with them? How is that not a choice then?

I am referring to the choice of those being killed. The people SBC affects are given a choice to be killed, information on the internet outlines what they do, people can drop the kool aide and leave. There is brainwashing and manipulation but the victim still has a choice and an out. CoS doesn't allow that choice for the people it has killed and continues to kill.



&gt; Again, they made the choice to join this church. I don't see how you can claim that someone who joins a church that calls for the death of suppressive persons has less of a choice than a woman who died because her access to medical care was taken away, whether she embraced the institution that took it or not.

They join the church and part of that is following its doctrine of fair game which L Ron Hubbard described. In the case that a family prays for their child rather than giving medical attention to that child, and the child dies, the government steps in and takes the child away. I don't see baptists doing that within the jurisdiction of the USA, namely because they get arrested, they know better. They might pull these stunts outsid eof the jurisdiction of the USA of course.","1207012932"

This is a contentless statement. _Everyone_ agrees that people communicate using a shared, socially-embedded system. Saying that we should use the word ""language"" to refer to this system and not to anything else simply adds nothing to the discussion. Nothing can ""show"" that this statement is true, because it's just a proposal regarding the use of terminology.

Chomsky makes an analogy which I think is quite helpful. He says that the question of whether ""language"" is fundamentally so-and-so or such-and-such is like the question of whether or not planes fly or submarines swim. There simply isn't any fact of the matter, it's just a question about how we use terminology.

&gt;It's like someone trying to work out which part of the brain is responsible for the rules of chess having the form they have. It's an interesting question but you're going to get puzzled looks if someone asks you to tell them about the game of chess and how it is played and you respond by going on about psycho-chemical processes in the brain, and such.

Yes, but so what? Both are legitimate topics of study (i.e. the psychology of chess playing and the game of chess considered as an abstract object). Even the most ardent Chomskian would agree that the study of animal communication is interesting and worth doing.","1207013074"

Because people making 50K a year are subject to 60% income tax?!

&gt;CoS doesn't allow that choice for the people it has killed and continues to kill.

But these people willingly join an organization that they know will kill them if they subvert its purposes. How is that not a choice?

&gt;In the case that a family prays for their child rather than giving medical attention to that child, and the child dies, the government steps in and takes the child away.

Good to know that the government will come haul off the body.

&gt;I don't see baptists doing that within the jurisdiction of the USA, namely because they get arrested, they know better. 

Evangelicals have caused deaths in many foreign countries by using their control of the US government to pressure those countries into withholding medical treatment and health education from women. 

I don't get why it's more unacceptable to kill people who knowingly join a murderous organization, than it is to kill people who may not even belong to the organization, just because those people happen to be brown-skinned or women.

&gt;I talked about not granting religious status which means no tax exemption, that doesn't mean the CoS is banned.

Let me go back and see what you said.

Edited: this is what you said:

&gt;I think a clause needs to be made that the religion doesn't ""harm the welfare of the general public"" then strip CoS of religious status across the country.

I'm not sure what you meant by stripping CoS of religious status (it sounds more to me that you meant the government should have the power to approve or disapprove religions)but I'll take you at your word that you only meant tax exemption.

However, your position was that a religion that harms the general welfare should be stripped of its tax exemption.

Again, I ask you, now that you're aware of all the harm to the general welfare that's been done by the SBC and the other Dominionist denominations--where are your calls to strip their tax exemption?

Tomboy has note categories. Right, so it's where muse mode was many years ago, and still has a few years to get anywhere near the currently available functionality.

Anjunta has nothing that Emacs hasn't had since around 2002.

And it's all still unconfigurable and bogs down what I consider fast systems. My dual athlon (2.13Ghz) system may be old but it ought not be bogged down by a window manager and a few applications.

Come on now, be reasonable.  He had never killed anyone before. Unless you assume he lived in a bubble and no one had ever cut him off in traffic before, or stolen from him then we can safely assume that he had never decided to kill someone UNTIL a criminal raped his girlfriend.

For MOST OF US, that is a pretty high bar.  Perhaps not a legitimate bar, but high enough that this guy isn't a threat to society in general.

You are using unlikely scenarios and improbable situations to try and make your case.

Sticking with the FACTS, this man lived his whole life without ever killing anyone, then someone comes along and rapes his girlfriend and he snaps and kills that guy. I'm comfortable with that guy as my next-door neighbor.  He doesn't need to be in jail for 16 years.

&gt;We don't even have to consider issues like this in a rational society where the laws are applied to everyone equally and vigilante justice is not allowed. 

We don't live in that society.  In that society (rational) his girlfriend wouldn't have been raped - right?

Think of it this way.  This guys is living his life.  He loves his girlfriend.  He is a useful and contributing member of society.

Then along comes a spider.  A man RAPES his girlfriend and now he becomes the bad guy... how is that even vaguely reasonable.  It is extremely likely this guy would have gone on and continued to be a contributing member of society - except for the rapist that we failed to protect him and his girlfriend from in the first place.

&gt;Would this guy murder his own grandmother for taking the last cookie? I don't know. 

Here - let me provide some EVIDENCE for you FTA:

**Valverde, 36, was a college student *with no criminal record when he learned that his girlfriend of three years had been raped* by Joel Schoenfeld, a photographer on probation for two other sex attacks.**

So?  You don't know if I would either.  But I bet if you apply a logical risk-based analysis you'd probably decide that neither HE nor I would do that. Honestly...

&gt;All I know is that he believes himself to be above the law and doesn't believe that the laws of the society he lives in don't prevent him from killing when he feels personally that it is justified.

Bullshit.  Are you a computer or an emotional human being?  His girlfriend was RAPED. We aren't talking about hypotheticals here.  You have the luxury of leaning back in your computer chair and telling us how things OUGHT TO BE (while taking no blame whatsoever for the society that allowed this rapist to be walking the streets in the first place) and you sit back and judge this guy as if he was some arrogant sociopath?

He suffered an injustice that you can only IMAGINE.  But you are smugly confident that he is the problem with society?  Where were you when the rapist could have been put behind bars for his previous attacks?

&gt;I can tell the difference between cutting someone off in traffic and raping someones girlfriend. Can this guy? I don't know. 


Here - let me help you with risk-based analysis again, you seem to be struggling with it.

**Valverde, 36, was *a college student with no criminal record* when he learned that his girlfriend of three years had been raped by Joel Schoenfeld, a photographer on probation for two other sex attacks.**

Teenagers are raging balls of hormones, that much is true.  However, that doesn't mean they're dumb- just hasty and inconsiderate.  If proper education is used, and it is made impossible to ignore the consequences of not thinking, I see no reason why sex education cannot save a lot of lives.  

At any rate, from the very article we are talking about it is clear that sex education has a very dramatic effect.  I say, increase the number of people with expose to this kind of stuff, and see if that 6/10 increases.

Also, I'm not sure where you're getting the government involvement angle from.  These are public schools that we're talking about.  Their job is to get kids ready to function in society.  Knowing how to have sex without getting killed or ruining their futures sees pretty bloody relevant to me.

Here's the classic statement on the subject (from [Dickens](http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/pva/pva344.html))

&gt;In its intention, I am well convinced that it is kind, humane, and meant for reformation; but I am persuaded that those who devised this system of Prison Discipline, and those benevolent gentlemen who carry it into execution, do not know what it is that they are doing. I believe that **very few men are capable of estimating the immense amount of torture and agony which this dreadful punishment, prolonged for years, inflicts upon the sufferers;** and in guessing at it myself, and in reasoning from what I have seen written upon their faces, and what to my certain knowledge they feel within, I am only the more convinced that **there is a depth of terrible endurance in it which none but the sufferers themselves can fathom, and which no man has a right to inflict upon his fellow-creature. I hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain, to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body:** and because its ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to the eye and sense of touch as scars upon the flesh; because its wounds are not upon the surface, and it extorts few cries that human ears can hear; therefore I the more denounce it, as a secret punishment which slumbering humanity is not roused up to stay. I hesitated once, debating with myself, whether, if I had the power of saying 'Yes' or 'No,' I would allow it to be tried in certain cases, where the terms of imprisonment were short; but now, I solemnly declare, that with no rewards or honours could I walk a happy man beneath the open sky by day, or lie me down upon my bed at night, with the consciousness that one human creature, for any length of time, no matter what, lay suffering this unknown punishment in his silent cell, and I the cause, or I consenting to it in the least degree.","1207014348"

&gt; But these people willingly join an organization that they know will kill them if they subvert its purposes. How is that not a choice?

For the sake of argument I was talking about people who criticize the church and are killed. There are also the CoS members who kill eachother. It's a death cult of sorts.

If only we can have the government designate certain dangerous religious organizations who continue to kill as dangerous.

&gt;I don't get why it's more unacceptable to kill people who knowingly join a murderous organization, than it is to kill people who may not even belong to the organization, just because those people happen to be brown-skinned or women.

Every life is just as important as everyone else's life. My point is that the CoS is killing people as part of its doctrine, no choices for the victim, it's cold blooded wait for the victim to drive on a secluded road and ram him off a cliff. It's that simple, let's not make it more complicated. Some people may pray instead of get medical treatment and be negligent, that isn't a part of church doctrine though.

Not the way I view the world.  He did what needed to be done, and what the law was apparently unable to do...

FTA: Valverde, 36, was a college student with no criminal record when he learned that his girlfriend of three years had been raped by Joel Schoenfeld, **a photographer on probation for two other sex attacks.**

&gt;It will scar him for the rest of his life unless he is a sociopath. Whether you think a killing is 'justified' or not, if you are not a sociopath, it will destroy you psychologically. 

citation needed - badly.

&gt;This guy should be punished severely for his crime because it is a crime that many people could easily be tempted to commit themselves - often on innocent people. That cannot be allowed to happen.

We see the world very differently.  Too bad for him that someone like me wasn't on the jury.

In my world, a rapist who was beating the system is killed by the boyfriend of one of the women he raped.  Life goes on.

In your world, the rapist is the victim and the man who FINALLY took him off the streets when the law seemed unable to do so - where that rapist can now no longer threaten your or your family - is a murderer who scares you and threatens society.

I'm unable to follow your logic.

Don't get me wrong, I see your point about vigilante justice in general. But I am able to look at an individual case and say, ""we'll let this one quietly slide under the carpet.""

I assume in your world, if I speed to the hospital with a mortally wounded child and his life is saved because I was able to get him there in time - I still need to be punished harshly and slapped down because society won't recover from lawbreakers who think they can drive dangerously when they perceive the situation to be extraordinary do so?

&gt;What is the drawback everyone is expecting if we DONT let people go around murdering people when they think they know someone else has broken the law?

I see what you did there.  You took a situation where someone DID BREAK THE LAW and then you acted like they only ""thought they broke the law.""  I understand now.  You don't care about this case.  You care about ""the big picture.""

Chucking a few (possibly even synthetic) supplements into processed foods to stop the general population showing noticeable vitamin deficiencies in the short-term is a poor substitute for all the complex nutrition that is stripped out or damaged - it's like erasing a rainbow from a photograph and photoshopping a replacement back in using exactly seven colours. All the colours are replaced, but the end result just isn't quite the same as what was started with. Vitamin supplementation of processed food certainly doesn't make the bad substances often contained in it disappear, nor does it reanimate destroyed enzymes.

This is not always true.  Australia has compulsory voting at state and federal elections, so ignoring the normally very small informal vote (invalid and therefore uncounted votes), it is a zero-sum game.

Our use of preferential voting probably complicates this a lot, but I'm not sure how, exactly.

That's not what I'm talking about. Have you been reading my posts or just making them up?

I really do not appreciate this bait and switch tactic of yours.

I'm talking about the SBC (and other Dominionists) pressuring governments to withhold lifesaving medical treatment and  lifesaving health information from women in order to bring about their deaths. This *is*  part of doctrine, and no, it doesn't provide any choices for those who are unable to get medical treatment or information.

That's a far cry from the victim praying instead of getting medical treatment. It's intentionally causing the death of myriads of other people. 

I don't see why you consider that more acceptable than killing someone with a motor vehicle. 

&gt;It's not a problem compare to CoS's murder history.

You made it clear that you don't consider the deaths of women in third world countries a problem. I simply don't agree with you. 


Edited to add: And again, you're moving the goal posts. Originally you said that a religion that harmed the general welfare should lose its tax exemption. Now you're saying only if they harm the general welfare of the people you deem valuable, and do to the extent you believe Scientology does.

Why not, you are...

&gt;He'd never kill unless it was something as bad as rape. And you know that. I apologize.

Well, we do have the information in the article that says he had no criminal record of ANY KIND before this incident.  So I'd argue that you could make a pretty good case that he certainly had shown no inclination whatsoever that he would kill, or even commit some lesser crime, UNTIL SOMEONE RAPED HIS GIRLFRIEND.

You can't be honest when you make his argument.  You really can't.  You can pretend and you can argue it as a logical game - but honestly you know that based on the evidence presented in the article, this was a law-abiding citizen who snapped when his girlfriend was raped. 

Rape appears to be a minor crime in your mind.  It is more serious to some of us.

&gt;All I see is that this guy is a murderer who thinks that he has the right to judge who lives and who dies in place of the judicial system we've agreed upon as a society.

It didn't appear to be working, since the article says the man who raped his girlfriend was on probation for - not one, but - TWO previous sexual assaults.

&gt;How does paying back rape with murder 'seem consistent'? Rape is a horrible crime, but to equate it with murder denigrates life itself

Spoken like someone who has never been raped.  It is clear that you consider rape to be a minor crime.  Perhaps you hate women?  It appears that way.  I understand where you are coming from now.  You are a misogynist and your hatred of women shows.","1207014998"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;Could it have been stopped merely by ratings systems?

Arguably, or at least it could have been slowed considerably, if not by ratings systems as such, then at least by an overriding voice of reason to counteract the destructive messages.  

&gt;No. The fault in every single case is the listener. 

Sorry, that is incorrect.  Abhorrent as it is to us, the ""good niggers"" knew their place during the times of slavery.  There were also plenty of children enrolled in the Hitler Youth, and plenty of kids were brainwashed into denouncing their parents during communist regimes.   

Even now, people in warring countries are brainwashed into thinking that suicide bombing is the best way to acquire virgins in the afterlife.

&gt;The people listening. Their abdication of the responsibility to think critically is the sole cause.

The unspoken presumption in your argument is that the ability to think critically is innate.  That is incorrect.  Critical thinking is a skill that is acquired through education and practice.  Children, by definition, have not mastered this ability.

The medium is not innocent.  It is neutral.  It carries messages, regardless of their value, so long as they conform to the characteristics of the medium.

The message is not morally null.  The message either has a positive value, a negative value, a mixed value, or a neutral value.  

Media certainly can have an effect on how a given message is received.  Videos of events have a very different impact than audio (only) recordings. Some people are more able to interpret visual cues than sound cues, for instance, or vice versa.


Retail Porn (especially before the internet) was restricted to persons over eighteen, because of the corrosive effect it (arguably) had on the minds of young people.  As the internet entered homes, porn became much more widespread and much, much more easily accessible, especially to young people.  The crime, before anyone knew who AOL was, was selling porn to children.  Now, there are very few children who have not had porn in their ""inbox"" completely unsolicited.  In that case, the medium (internet communication) had a huge impact on peoples' behavior, especially that of children, who were exposed to sexual material much earlier than they would have otherwise been.","1207015407"

There is a lot of speculation that one of the main reasons why Scott got the South Pole expedition command, rather than the much more qualified Shackleton, is that Shackleton, although Anglo-Irish, was still an Irishman by the standards of the day.  (From the County Kildare, if memory serves.)

In any case, had Shackleton been given command of the British South Polar expedition, it is likely that history would have played out a bit differently.  I do not suggest that he would have beaten Amundsen to the pole --Amundsen was a strong and competent leader (though possibly overly intolerant of even the slightest hint of insubordination) and the Norwegians were incredibly well-organized, trained and supplied-- but I do suggest that he would have happily used sled-dogs (Scott refused to do  so and instead used ponies, the use of which had long been discredited in Polar exploration, and which later had to be abandoned in favor of man-hauling) and that that and his excellent qualities as a leader may well have prevented the expedition's tragic ending.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Many moons ago, I used to work at an indie record store in Seattle called Cellophane Square.  It was a pretty decent record store - they grilled me during the interview process.  Basically, I spent about two hours convincing them that my taste in music was cool enough for them to bestow the honor and privilege of a job that paid $6 an hour.

Anyway, I got the job and on my first day the manager (who thought he was the coolest thing since sliced bread) was training me and he started to tell me how I shouldn't mock customers who wanted to buy crappy music.  And yes, despite the fact that I was (and still am) a big music snob, I agreed with him.  Of course, I also thought that HE had a crappy taste in music (I remember that he liked Joy Division and I still think that that band sucks).  But anyway, just as he finished telling me this, some customer walked up to the front counter, asking for something extremely uncool like Toad the Wet Sprocket or something and without skipping a beat, he totally vibed the guy right there in front of me and the other customers.  It freaked me out how blissfully ignorant he was of his own hypocrisy.  Anyway, I didn't work there for very long, it ended up not being such a cool job and I soon realized I really needed to get my act together and make some serious money.

And the moral of my story is that people are assholes.  Just listen to whatever music you want.  Someone will always think they listen to better music than you do.

That's a sickening and appalling position to take. Bad enough to condemn these women to death for the ""crime"" of not being able to carry a child safely to term because it implanted in the wrong place---much worse,  blaming the decision on the women themselves!

I can't even imagine how much a person would have to hate women to say that if a doctor refuses to treat a woman for a lethal, but easily correctable condition, it's her own fault.","1207015623"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Nazism's relationship with capitalism is actually really complex and interesting.  Here's what Robert O. Paxton (one of the msot respected historians of fascism) said on the subject.

&gt;Another supposed essential character of fascism is its anticapitalist, antibourgeois animus. Early fascist movements flaunted their contempt for bourgeois values and for those who wanted only ""to earn money, money, filthy money."" They attacked ""international finance capitalism"" almost as loudly as they attacked socialists. They even promised to expropriate department-store owners in favor of patriotic artisans, and large landowners in favor of peasants.

&gt;Whenever fascist parties acquired power, however, they did nothing to carry out these anticapitalist threats. By contrast, they enforced with the utmost violence and thoroughness their threats against socialism. Street fights over turf with young communists were among their most powerful propaganda images. Once in power, fascist regimes banned strikes, dissolved independent labor unions, lowered wage earners' purchasing power, and showered money on armaments industries, to the immense satisfaction of employers.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I am a teenager, and I would never have sex without proper protection, and a high level of mutual trust and respect with the person I was with. STDs or pregnancy can not only screw up your life, but the life of your significant other, and some innocent child.

I hate to be the one to break this to you - but you are not representative of the majority of your peers.

&gt;Teenagers are raging balls of hormones, that much is true. However, that doesn't mean they're dumb- just hasty and inconsiderate. 

Didn't say they were dumb.  Just hasty and inconsiderate.  They are dumb too, though - now that you mention it.

Before you get mad, consider my perspective.

I WAS a teenager.  I WAS dumb.  I didn't know it at the time, and in fact - was quite convinced that people who were older than me were dumb.  At the very least, I felt they didn't respect me properly and I was dumb enough to never once stop and think about WHY they might think that.

Of course now it is clear.  They had been there before and they knew firsthand.

Now I realize that I'm generalizing.  Perhaps even over-generalizing.  But generally speaking, what I say is true.

Teens lack long-term reasoning skills.  As I mentioned earlier, it isn't even their fault.  We are evolved to take tremendous risks as teens for instant gratification and with little regard for future consequences.

There are exceptions I'm sure, but that is the general rule of thumb for teens.

&gt;If proper education is used, and it is made impossible to ignore the consequences of not thinking, I see no reason why sex education cannot save a lot of lives.

Hmm, I don't disagree that there are some who would benefit.  We're kind of on a tangent now. You're talking about teens.  I'm talking about government's role in educating my children and I'm thinking a lot younger than teens.

My kids will understand what sex is, how it works and what the pitfalls are by their teens.  I will teach them.  What I'm here arguing is whether or not the government has any right to tell me how to educate my kids about sex and WHEN to educate them about sex.

&gt;At any rate, from the very article we are talking about it is clear that sex education has a very dramatic effect. I say, increase the number of people with expose to this kind of stuff, and see if that 6/10 increases.

Actually, the article appears to be very fragile and fraught with misapplied and statistically insignificant numbers.  This is typical of statistics in studies.

ALWAYS ask yourself what is the writer's agenda before believing statistics.  Then, even if you decide there is no agenda, look carefully to make sure the writer didn't misapply statistics or use numbers that are meaningless for some reason or another.

You are young, but make a point to follow studies over time. You'll find that almost every study you hear about or are told about will have another study come along in a couple of years that will completely refute the study that everyone was so sure of just a couple of years before.

After a while, if you are reasonable, you'll develop a healthy skepticism of studies.

Or - like most people - you'll just believe the ones that mesh with your worldview and discount the ones that conflict with it.

&gt;Also, I'm not sure where you're getting the government involvement angle from. These are public schools that we're talking about. Their job is to get kids ready to function in society. Knowing how to have sex without getting killed or ruining their futures sees pretty bloody relevant to me.

Wait til you are a parent. I suspect you'll have developed a huge disappointment in government's ability to do much well, and you'll want to make those kinds of decisions for yourself - as a parent who loves AND KNOWS his/her children.

&gt;Incidentally, I'm not going to take umbrage at your comment about poor reasoning skills in teenagers, because it is frequently true. But keep in mind that it is by no means universal. Some of us can think.

I'll buy that.  I like to think that I was above average in that group.  Through a combination of nerdiness and intelligence I was able to get through my teens without fathering any unwanted children or contracting any incurable stds.

But so many fail at this that you have to see that the vast majority of teens aren't equipped to make these kinds of decisions well.","1207015988"

Maybe you should take your own advice and do some research. **It's doctors who refuse to treat for fear of being arrested, not patients who refuse the treatment.**

Wikipedia cannot help here. It's not that the women don't know what the treatment is. They aren't stupid or uninformed. How could Wikipedia help? **You think Jimbo Wales is going to come through the monitor and demand that the doctor save her life?**

The women **want** the treatment. Many of them beg for it or try to get it on the black market after being turned away by doctors. But the treatment is not available to them, because the religious right refuses to let doctors perform it.

Are you really too dumb to understand the difference between a patient refusing medical treatment and the medical establishment refusing to provide it?

You really are so devoid of common sense and reading comprehension that you can't grasp the difference between those two concepts?

A belief does not require proof.  Do you believe that we are the only living beings in the universe or not?  After you choose, can you prove it?

&gt; The fact that some intelligent people believe(d) in some fairy tale only shows that early indoctrination very powerful juju. 

Again, easily disprovable.  There are PLENTY of intelligent Christians, Hindus, Muslims, etc who converted late in life.  Some of whom were athiests before their conversion.

Intelligence is NOT exclusive of belief in religion.  Please don't misunderstand me.  I am militant agnostic.  (I don't know and YOU DON'T EITHER!) 

But I can clearly see that there are intelligent people who believe in religion, just as there are intelligent people who do not.  You CAN be intelligent and believe in God.

&gt;In the absence of religious poisoning in childhood, I doubt very much that you would see intelligent people professing faith in the unseeable, unknowable, undemonstrable. 

You can doubt it, but it will still be true.

Haven't you ever pondered ""Why are we here?""  ""What is the purpose of the Universe?""  ""Why does ANYTHING exist at all?""

These are unknowable things. Choosing to believe something that gives you comfort does not make you unintelligent.

It is equally ""stupid"" to believe you are right as an athiest.  That is JUST AS UNKNOWABLE as theism.

Agnosticism is the only truly supportable belief system.  (I told you I was militant.)  A simple ""I DON'T KNOW"" is the correct answer to all of these questions.

"funny","t5_2qh33","To the guy doing my wife. You know who you are. Yes I know. No I am not angry, I would just ask a few things of you. After all you are giving it to my wife. 

1.Please stop leaving the seat up, I keep getting blamed and it is starting to get old. 

2.You may be giving me a chance to go fishing more often but please stop drinking all my beer. It is fine if you have a couple while you visit(god knows 
I drink plenty before I find her attractive), but please leave me a few as I have to be there longer than you. 

3.If you do drink the last one buy more or leave money on the counter I will pick some up. 

4.Please replace the toilet paper when you use it all. For some reason my 5 year old son belives if its not there he does not have to wipe. We keep it under the sink, unless you can recomend a better spot? 

5.After doing my wife please use something disposable to wipe off with. The basket of clothes on the right is mine and the clothes are clean as my wife does not do my washing, Irun out of time rushing to work. Last week my sweatshirt was crusty(thanks). 

6.Please do not tell my children that you are their uncle, they are young not 
mentaly challenged. 

7.Please stop turning the heat up, You pay nothing and MUD is putting it in my ass, my wife may like it but I think it hurts. 

8.When she asks ""do these pants make me look fat"", say no. You may think giving a different answer will make her think twice about eating a gallon of ice cream a day but all you are doing is giving her a reason to go buy more pants that she will look just as fat in. 

9.Stop eating the baked goods. The brownies you ate were from my mom for my birthday. My wife has not cooked anything that good for years and if she does she will not share. 

10.Try shifting your weight when you sit on my chair. The recliner that I rarely have time for (soccer games and practice, basketball camp for the kids takes much of my time and I try to help with school work too)has a grove in it that forces me to roll to the left. 

Lastly I would like thank you for taking her to lunch on Valentines Day. She was not as hungry as usual and only orded one meal.I may be able to use the money I saved to take the children to a movie. I hope you can help me with these items, it may become ackward if I have to confront her. If you can do this for me I will give you a heads up on when I will be gone and for how long so that you don't feel rushed.

1. I'm not a creation literalist. I think Genesis is poetic but contains the substance of great truths. 

2. I don't think evolutionary development via mutation disproves God's existence, however if true I do think it has potential to give insight into the nature of God, if He designed us through it. (ie it means death, randomness and competition are inherent in our nature)

3. Science deals in natural explanations for natural phenomena. It simply isn't about the supernatural, except where such things (if they exist) effect the natural. Religion is God's influence on us. So the two intersect on how/if the supernatural effects the natural. Religion has tentacles in things like ethics, etc, which may or may not be the domain of science.

4. Intelligent Design dates back to Plato (or earlier), who proposed a teleological cosmology. Its current incarnation is mostly just a guise for religious creationism, but I think it has merits independent of that.","1207016911"

Just remember that you don't _have_ to send your kids to public school.  


At any rate, yes, this study is probably biased.  But the vast majority of studies not blatantly purchased by private interests show this to be the case.  Common sense shows this to be the case.  Teenagers have been having sex for a couple of million years now.  Tens of millions, actually, depending on how liberal your understood definition of human is.  They're not going to stop anytime soon, saving total conversion into a theocracy.  The best we can do is to try to make sure they act responsibly and safely.  

But that's not the main topic that we seem to be disagreeing on:

Let's focus on this.

_But so many fail at this that you have to see that the vast majority of teens aren't equipped to make these kinds of decisions well._

Then who should make those decisions?  Every generation of parents builds up the delusion that their kids can have an innocent, protected childhood, and every generation utterly fails to have any idea what their kids are up to by the time they hit seventeen.  I don't know why it happens, but in our society, it does.  Our grandparents wanted to project our parents.  They failed.  Our parents wanted to protect us.  Tell me - how much did they succeed in your case?  

Frankly, regardless of our parents hopes, teens ARE going to be the ones making these decisions.  Without totally constraining them (i.e. tracking collars, 24 hour surveillance) this is not going to change.  We need to make sure that they have every piece of information necessary to make these decisions. 

Do you disagree?  If so, I'd love to hear your take on this.

Surely you are aware that the CIA has changed the way they handle subversion on foreign soil, starting from 1980. The National Endowment for Democracy, the US entity responsible for funding and instigating many of the recent colour revolutions has been active in China, and has no doubt been complementing the work of the Tibetan exiles. To deny this is to admit one's naivity.

&gt;But tell me why is that wrong for Dalai lama to finance his Government in exile ? Feed the Tibetans in exile ?

Why is it the duty of the US to not only fund these exiles but to fund their subversive activities in a foreign nation? Why should the **CIA** be the Lama's caretaker? Recall just what the CIA is, what is has done in the past, and what it is doing in conjunction with the NED today. 

I am no fan of US sponsored 'revolutions' regardless of where they are staged. The Orange and Cedar revolutions have shown them to be undemocratic by overfunding West-leaning political forces at the expense of the rest of the population. That doubtlessly applies as much to Tibet as it does for Ukraine and Lebanon.

That was kind of the whole thrust of the 20 year old article you quoted.

&gt;The facts still stand, gays are much more likely to get aids than heterosexuals.

http://www.avert.org/statsum.htm

Even if you count only men, that's not really true. Only 59% of the men with HIV/AIDs got it simply from having sex with other men.

And women count too don't they? No women seem to have gotten HIV or AIDS from gay sex.

Overall, when you count men and women's relative numbers, only about 45% of HIV cases are from homosexual contact.

And the number of new cases due to heterosexual contact is growing much quicker than the # due to homosexual contact: 

&gt;The number of new cases probably due to heterosexual contact grew by 42%; cases probably due to sex between men grew by 24%; and the number among injecting drug users fell by less than 1%.

The difference in the growth rate between populations is the reason that relying on 20 year old articles about an almost new phenomenon at that point, isn't very sound.","1207017632"

&gt;Really, who provides census data to UN ?

If you did your homework, you would realize that the census figures are accurate and make historical sense. The ""6 million"" figure thrown about by the Lama does exist, but not inside the traditional borders of Tibet.

Much like China has a diaspora around the worls, Tibetans also have one within China. It should be no surprise that many Tibetans have migrated from the Tibetan plateau into the more temperate and fertile lowlands east of the plateau.

This diaspora is the Greater Tibet the Lama used to refer to (not sure if he still does). Within the physical area of 'Greater Tibet', Tibetans are indeed a minority. But is this a result of ""cultural genocide"", or of statistical manipulation by the Dalai Lama.

The fact that you weren't even aware of the origins of the figure of 6 million hardly inspires me regarding your dedication to fact finding.


Edit:

&gt;If every thing is so hunky dory in Tibet, and Tibetans have only benefited from China's occupation

Sir, I never made such a claim. I entered this discussion not to make apologies or justifications for Chinese rule, but to counter a common, yet serious, misconception. I am not interested in a debate on the larger issues as much as I am in challenging false propaganda when I see it.

I got so used to MS's way of doing things, I was surprised at how easy Linux could be. I probably wasted more time trying the MS way of things. 

Anyway, I'd love to see FOSS get some real coverage. MS survives now on format lock in and ignorance.","1207017808"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Then who should make those decisions? Every generation of parents builds up the delusion that their kids can have an innocent, protected childhood, and every generation utterly fails to have any idea what their kids are up to by the time they hit seventeen. I don't know why it happens, but in our society, it does. Our grandparents wanted to project our parents. They failed. Our parents wanted to protect us. Tell me - how much did they succeed in your case?

Good questions. First - you ask WHO should make these decisions and I would answer, ""the parents.""  In spite of the fact that they don't always, or even often get it right.

It is part of the responsibility of being a parent.  You try to learn from when you were a kid and how your parents interacted with you and you do the best you can.

I'll let you in on a secret: (because I am so wise ;-)  Almost NO ONE gets it right.  There IS NO right.  As you point out, the teen will ultimately make the decision.

The parent does the best they can to try and make sure the teen has the best information and best tools to work with - but because they are a teenager and because of all the reasons we discussed that teens aren't good at this kind of decision making, they don't GENERALLY do a good job of it.

It is just the way life is.

You asked another question.  How did my parents do?  I was in fifth grade (what is that, about 9 or 10 years old) and a friend taught me the world ""dildo.""  I came home and promptly called my brother (younger) a dildo.

My parents asked me if I knew what it meant.  I did not.

They sat me down and had THE TALK.  Penis. Vagina.  The works.  No pulling punches.

I was enthralled.  I was too young to be embarrassed, or perhaps too geeky to realize that I should be embarrassed.  I saw it as a treasure-trove of information about a subject I was very curious about.

I remember feeling much older and wiser the next day as I headed off to school in my crosswalk patrolman's belt to direct my ignorant fellow students across the roadway.

I also happened to be a reader.  As I got older, I read up on the subject.  Books under my parents bed, in their closets.  At the library.  Wherever I could get my hands on them.

I was the most knowledgable, but inexperienced kid in my school - probably.

In the end - how did my parents do?  Great on paper.  They took the bull by the horns and delivered the message clearly.

How did I do?  I got lucky (well, not figuratively).  I still made lots of mistakes.  I was VERY PRO-CONDOM when I did finally become sexually active.  But there were still a couple of times where the opportunity was there and the situation just didn't work out with the birth control.  I gambled, pulled out, prayed - whatever.

Maybe I did that less often than my less educated friends.  Maybe because of that I was playing an odds game and keeping the odds balanced just enough in my favor that I won.  Or maybe I just got lucky and that girl that dropped out of school when she was 15 to go have a kid really did have sex ONE TIME and got pregnant.  Who knows?

I think the truth is that, like many things, being book-smart with sex only takes you so far.  It is definitely a good basis, but you have to learn about sex by having sex at some point.  And for most teens, some of those points are going to be risky ones.

&gt;Frankly, regardless of our parents hopes, teens ARE going to be the ones making these decisions. Without totally constraining them (i.e. tracking collars, 24 hour surveillance) this is not going to change. We need to make sure that they have every piece of information necessary to make these decisions.

I agree with this.  You and I aren't far apart - if at all on this issue.  My beef is with the government doing the teaching and choosing when and how to educate my kid.  I have EVERY intention of telling my kids much like my parents told me - some differences - but essentially the same information.

I just want to be the one to do it when I want to do it - not when the govt says I should do it and how they say I should do it.

:-)

I'd personally drop another $50 or so into the motherboard for the option to have SLI and more (faster) RAM, and another $60 or so into the videocard for extra bonus future-proofing.  I'd go with Vista or XP x64 along with more, faster ram as well.  It's worth the extra $200 bucks or so IMO.

A buddy of mine just showed me the benchmarks he got with the [Geforce 9600 GT](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130334), and it compares very favorably against the Geforce 8800 GTS.  It apparently runs Crysis on high from 20-30 FPS, which is certainly playable.  If I recall correctly, TV is something like 24 fps.  

The PC in that configuration would run Crysis just fine on medium, but don't let the word fool you: I played through the game on medium and it was still the most gorgeous game I've ever played.

Also, check to make sure your power supply is strong enough to handle that beefy videocard.

Fair warning on that videocard as well: a few of them are defective and have a black-screen crash, but EVGA has an unlimited lifetime free replacement warranty in case of hardware failure.  If you have repeated issues and have to keep replacing it **and** complain, they'll upgrade you to an even better videocard for free.  

If you're interested in protecting the longevity of your CPU, I use [this fan](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134) in my box.  Just sayin'.

Edit for clarity on SLI: having the option as an upgrade path down the line is pretty wise.  Later on, a second 9600 GT would cost peanuts and show an enormous performance boost.  Also, if SLI isn't your thing, you'd be able to run up to 3 monitors with that configuration...

I'll take this to an extreme to (hopefully) demonstrate my point. When somebody is clinically insane and kills somebody, they don't go to prison for murder, they get sent to the insane asylum [1].  It doesn't matter if the victim 'deserved it' or not - the insane assailant cannot be held responsible for intent to kill and isn't processed by the  criminal justice system.  Instead they go through a psychiatric handling system.

Your argument is based on the question of whether or not the victim deserved it, and I claim the question isn't germane.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I see, so you are claiming the state of Wisconsin ""called a halt"" to studies at roughly the same time as it decided to drastically expand the scope of the program, removing many restrictions so more families could take advantage of the vouchers. Interesting.

Meanwhile, the study referenced is under the auspices of the University of Arkansas, and you are - like the referenced blog posting - totally misreading it. The comparison statistics in this ""baseline"" study don't on their own tell you much useful about relative performance.

For instance, consider the possibility that some students switch to voucher schools because they *were doing badly* in the government-run schools. Then the ever-so-slightly lower performance in the early years (grades 3-5) would mostly reflect on what these kids failed to learn in public school, on the poor study habits they acquired there and are working to improve or overcome, and perhaps on the fact that these were just plain poor students with parents who were desperate to try something - anything - different in hopes that it might help.

Or here's another story. Perhaps the ever-so-slightly-lower math scores just reflect different priorities. Perhaps the voucher schools discovered it was easier to teach math a little later in a child's life than was standard for government-run schools. Then you'd see what we actually do see in the current data - math scores lag a little in the earliest grades but the students catch up later. Is this something to be particularly worried about? Indeed you could put the reverse spin on it - if the voucher kids were behind in grades 3-5 but have caught up in grades 6-9, it means they have been learning *at a higher rate* later in life than the government-school kids, implying they'll really blow right by and surpass during high school.

We just don't know.

We'll be able to say something concrete about relative student performance in the two systems *after* we've had a chance to revisit the scores of these *same* students a few years down the line. But we can't say much now.","1207018606"

One of the things that I never completely understood is why Israel's intelligence services helped Hamas establish itself in the Palestinian territories.  More on this history in [Hamas' Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Hamas#Before_1987_.E2.80.94_Palestinian_Islamic_activities_prior_to_the_creation_of_Hamas):

&gt; According to the Israeli weekly Koteret Rashit (October 1987), ""The Islamic associations as well as the [Islamic university — founded in 1978 in Gaza] had been supported and encouraged by the Israeli military authority"" in charge of the (civilian) administration of the West Bank and Gaza. ""They [the Islamic associations and the university] were authorized to receive money payments from abroad."" By the end of 1992, there were 600 mosques in Gaza. Hamas attracted members through preaching and charitable work before spreading its influence into trade unions, universities, bazaars, professional organizations and local government political races beginning in December 2004. “Thanks to Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad (Israel’s Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks), the Islamists were allowed to reinforce their presence in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, the members of Fatah (Movement for the National Liberation of Palestine) and the Palestinian Left were subjected to the most brutal form of repression”, according to L'Humanité.[1] Indeed Israel supported and encouraged Hamas' early growth in an effort to undermine the secular Fatah movement of Yasser Arafat.[2] According to UPI, Israel supported Hamas starting in the late 1970s as a ""counterbalance to the Palestine Liberation Organization"".[3] At that time, Hamas's focus was on ""religious and social work"". The grassroots movement concentrated on social issues such as exposing corruption, administration of waqf (trusts) and organizing community projects.","1207019052"

Yeah. **I have a habit of saying things that are true. I'm funny like that.**

They studied it for four years to see if it would hurt the kids before expanding it. Since there was basically no difference in achievement between the groups, they showed it wasn't hurting the kids and parents liked it, so they expanded it. (Further studies have shown that parents pick schools for reasons other than academics and will keep a student in a voucher school they picked even if it's doing badly).

Here's a link. You can get more information on the older studies if you dig.

http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0523/p01s03-usgn.html 

&gt;**Studies done in the early years of Milwaukee's program, before the state stopped requiring yearly reporting from voucher schools** and before religious schools were allowed into the program, **showed little difference in student achievement** among voucher students, but measurable improvement in parental satisfaction.

What did you think happened instead? Did you imagine they had done no studies at all before expanding the program? Or did you imagine they had been studying it the entire almost 20 year history?

&gt;implying they'll really blow right by and surpass during high school.

Like I said, you can make up all the scenarios you want. You can even imagine that the fossils were put in the ground to try our faith.

Milwaukee has had this voucher program almost 20 years now. If the voucher kids were going to surpass the other kids by high school, wouldn't they have done it by now? ","1207019088"

Gays make up less than 10% of all people, yet they account for almost half of all cases.

Using your own link, for men, 59% of aids cases come from men who have sex with men. Gays sex is more lethal than hetero sex.

edit: also from you link ""During the 1990s, the epidemic shifted steadily toward a growing proportion of AIDS cases among black people and Hispanics and in women, and toward a decreasing proportion in MSM, although this group remains the largest single exposure group.""

Notice that in your link, it says the MSM (Men having Sex with Men) remains the largest single exposure group. But at the same time, they represent only half of the maybe 10% of the population who are gay.

"ruby","t5_2qh21","no, I don't think it was intentional. but I think the monkeys are kind of a necessary evil, or an unpleasant but tolerable side effect.

DHH did a pretty amazing job marketing Rails. the adoption curve is through the freaking roof and went that far almost instantly.

(btw I wanted to say hi at MWRC.)

anyway - I know I'm contradicting myself here but I think the presence of people who can't code that brilliantly is actually a good thing. I don't mean drawing in programmers who are bad - I mean designers and business types who look at the code, figure it's easy enough for them, and jump in.

I don't know if it's intentional or not but I think newbies who build apps in Rails because it's so easy, or appears to be so easy, in that context making things easy is really a very good thing. attracting corner-cutting types is bad; attracting people from other fields who realize they can do at least basic sketch versions of Web apps in Rails probably makes the community pretty healthy. it's good to have that kind of diversity.

I can't blame people who are new to coding for being less skillful than people with experience, that's practically a tautology, but I think in the long run the designers and suits sketching their own apps add enough to the community that suffering through the inanities of the PHP monkeys and the fanboys isn't such a terrible ordeal.

and honestly I really don't think DHH was *necessarily* selling the fact that you don't need to be skilled to get it going, etc. It's possible that he was selling the fact that you don't have to do anything useless, or repetitive, or trivial and tiresome. When you see somebody selling simple, that isn't really the same thing as selling easy. And Rails doesn't really do a whole lot of the *heavy* lifting for you, as you say above; it's more that it does the *boring* lifting.

Writing SQL queries and boilerplate JavaScript is something you hand to a code generator because it's dead-dumb easy, so much so that a computer could do it and should. This is like my talk at MWRC. Nothing in that talk was *actually* complicated. The power comes from *leveraging* it. The technique consists of four things: puts, eval, ERB, and the ability to pipe Unix standard out into a file. Do these things in a particular order and they become quite powerful, but none of them is complex in and of themselves. Boilerplate code of any variety fits code generation really well, but the win isn't that the complexity disappears. What's complex doesn't become easy, but its complexity does become very easy *to manage*.

I think this distinction between simple and easy is a pretty subtle distinction. it's pretty natural that advertizing simple gets you a ton of people who were looking for easy. the overabundance of lazy fuckers is certainly annoying, but it could be worse. we could have an overabundance of curly braces. that shit would be murder.

Under the influence of alcohol, there are basically three things you can do: 
1. Dance.
2. Play simple games.
3. Act like an idiot.

Once you realize the acting like an idiot is stupid, that the simple drinking games are boring, and that every club is the same... well, I don't know, getting drunk just isn't what it used to be.  On top of all this, add the fact that hangovers really, really suck.

Weed, by contrast, **enhances** the enjoyment of most activities.  Drunken sex is sloppy, but while high it's amazing.  Watching a movie drunk usually ends 15 minutes in a slumber, but after a joint I see myself being absorbed into the plot.  Going to a nice restaurant is sublime.

Should we just let her have it because, after all, it's her turn: ""Sit down, Obama, yes you boy, back there in the rear seat, this nice white lady here wants that seat? Be a good boy and we might let you ride behind her.""

Give me a break. Mr&amp;MrsC may not be political newbies, but it's hard to believe even the newest of newbies could think she could get away with her Assault on Bosnia tale. Anyone who seriously thinks she's going to ride that one out is delusional. Makes the tank rider of past Democratic campaign fiascoes look like a blip. MrsC's greatest weakness is the perception -- to a great extent true -- that she cannot or will not tell the truth when the going gets rough. She's gotten away with it for decades, in part because the zombies of your political party have ignored it. Well that crap is over. No one is going to make excuses for her. Well, maybe not no one; there's always James and Geraldine.

Sure, it's remotely possible that Obama will falter, but even then, I do not believe the party will go with MrsC. There is a long tradition of Democratic self mutilation, but not this time. 

As for savvy political minds, I think it's clear that we are seeing the new master of the field. Twelve years ago--back when you started your righteous anti-Christian campaign you're so proud of--what credence would you have given to someone who told you a black man would be the senator from Illinois (after carrying downstate bible-belt country). And, that black man would be the front runner for the Democratic nomination for president? If you don't think that's the mark of political savvy, you would do better to go back to beating on the Christian fundies.

Had that happened, the British Empire would have chuckled condescendingly and then got to thinking about ways in which to undermine and exploit its former rebellious colonies, now weakened by half and newly presented with an enemy state with which it shared a thousand mile border and with which, in terms of western expansion, it would certainly come into further conflict.  

Had Lincoln not done what he did, I submit to you that the North American continent would have been laid wide open to further European interference and that the US would currently be just one of dozens of other North American nations as is in fact the case in South America, albeit for slightly different reasons.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;when your own current link proved my initial point.

You're still not taking the differential rates at which HIV is spreading in the two populations. (And you seem to be totally ignoring women, incidentally).

Who do you think you're more at risk from: a gay man who got HIV 10 years ago, knows he has it and is able/willing to take steps to prevent spreading it...or a straight man with HIV who doesn't know he has it and doesn't think he's at risk?

You may see more of #1 in the gay population than you do of #2 in the straight population, but that doesn't mean that you're safer having sex with guy #2.

The reason I didn't like your link is because encouraging men to think that they're not at any real risk if they only have unprotected sex with women is irresponsible. And no, I don't find anything funny about that.

&gt;maybe you won't cite your incorrect theories.

A. you don't know what a theory is.

and 

B. you still haven't shown anything to show that the rate isn't rising in the heterosexual population faster than in the homosexual population--just as I said and my link said.

C. you're also overlooking that many of the men who get HIV via MSM sex consider themselves straight and also have relations with women, fueling the large rise we've seen in the heterosexual community.","1207021176"

"business","t5_2qgzg","Prices lower than *what*, though?  Since the cost of having someone standing around to pump the gas is built in to the purchase price, you know that you're being charged more than it would otherwise cost, if you could pump it yourself.

That it's still cheaper than $otherstate probably has to do with OR's (or NJ's) tax structure.  They're probably not* imposing as much of a tax on gasoline as neighboring states, and making up the shortfall elsewhere.

So there are two conclusions we can draw from this:

* Consumers are being forced to pay for an unnecessary service, which as evidenced by the demise of full-service elsewhere, very few people are actually interested in paying for when the cost is broken out.

* Residents of the states that make it mandatory are getting screwed on their other taxes, because in order to hide the cost of having attendants pump their gas, the states are taxing it less than they otherwise could while maintaining the same 'pump price.' 

Seems like a bad deal all around to me.

*See [here](http://www.oregongasprices.com/tax_info.aspx).  Oregon's gas tax is 43c/gal, Washington's is 54, California's is 64.  That's how they manage to effectively subsidize gas station attendants while still making the prices  lower than CA.","1207021481"

   | Why is it so difficult for americans to understand that other peoples can be patriotically inclined to defend their country against an unwarranted attack and occupation on their land?	

Because “peoples” don’t defend their countries anymore, do they? Most of the world counts on their relationship with the US to defend them from interlopers. Iraq changed hands half a dozen times in the twentieth century including being ruled twice by Britain. I am not impressed by the Iraqi people’s history of shaking off tyranny.  Saddam, remember him, took Kuwait in 1990 and whom did the Kuwaitis call to their aid?

The pretenses for war turned out later to be wrong but that was not known when the decision to go to war happened.

I completely disagree.  Addicts don't just hurt themselves.  They have family and friends who suffer as they see a loved descend into that abyss.  It is only when the addict truly realizes the depth their own depravity that they have a chance of coming back.  Telling them that ""somehow they are really a victim too, even if only a victim of them self"" does not promote the mentality necessary to overcome an addiction.  If you talk to former addicts, they will always tell you that they were only able overcome their addiction by looking deep inside and finding the strength to do so; they need to look inside and say ""I am way off here, I fucked up, and now I need to unfuck myself.""  When you teach them to say ""I am way off here, because of XYZ, and if it wasn't for XYZ than I would be able to get out of this rut.  The successful people are the ones who realize that they are the XYZ.
Unfortunately (and rather ironically), our society, while using the rhetoric of open-mindedness and free thinking actually makes it harder for people to get out of their comfort zones and challenge themselves.  Overcoming an addiction is like discarding a long-held and cherished belief; you need to abandon part of your identity and take on a new one, something that we are less and less able to do, I fear.

Additionally, I would point out that shame can be a great motivator.  Sometimes in life, you need someone to say STFU, get off your ass and stop acting like a loser, you bum!

Please allow me to rephrase your questions. 

&gt;Do I think the government should set standards and declare ""appropriate"" age ranges for books, plays, and other forms of media?

Sure, I do! (These government bodies already exist; I don't need to propose more of them.    Government size and bureaucracy is a distinct argument from the idea of government regulation.)

There's a wide grey area for parents&amp; guardians to decide, but there are some things that children just should not see.  I firmly believe that kids under 5, for instance, have a sacred right NOT to know most aspects of sexual intercourse.  

I also believe that they have a right not to know what it feels like to have the shit scared out of them by any artificial means (haunted houses, scary movies, etc.)  They are just learning how to live, and don't need to confront certain ideas yet.

Kids around, and under, the age of puberty need to know the mechanics of sex and probably need to know how to be safe doing what most parents would prefer that they not do.  But they don't need to sit through ""Debbie Does Dallas"" or whatever. The government does well to limit the access of children to pornography. They DO need to know that they have the right to say ""NO, and the responsibility to accept ""no"" for an answer.

The Government already declares which books are age (or at least grade-level) appropriate.  For instance, without the help of an older friend, brother or sister, no first grader is likely to get his hands on a 4th grade reader or math book.  If a 1st grader did so, he or she might be daunted by the relatively high skill level, and may grow discouraged in his own work. 

R-rated films aren't declared so by the government, but the MPAA has plenty of authority to enforce them.

&gt;Hasn't it been shown time and again that giving people the power to censor and limit media is always more dangerous than not?

No.  See above in this comment about age - appropriate textbooks and pornography.  Children are limited in their ability to put information in the proper context, therefore guidance and censorship is entirely appropriate.

---

*By FAIR GAME is meant,*

*may not be further protected by*

*the codes and disciplines of Scientology*

*or the rights of a Scientologist.*

*The families and adherents Of Suppressive Persons or GROUPS may not receive processing. It does not matter whether they are or are nor Scientologists. If the families or adherents of Suppressive Persons or Groups are processed, any auditor doing so is guilty of a misdemeanor.*

---

So what does this mean?

If you want to piss on and make life hard for Scientologists, then we are not required to be your friend, and we are not required to even be nice to you. 

We won't tell our friends to be nice to you either. 

If someone is mean and nasty to you, like you want to be to us, well, we won't object too loudly. 

Further more, if you insist on being mean and nasty to us, then you and your friends will not be permitted to take advantage of Scientology training or other services at an official facility.

We are not going to accord you any special rights on the basis of your actions.

And I presume you do not want to take advantage of these services in the first place.

If you want to buy a bunch of the books 2nd hand, and try to train yourself, go for it, have a blast.

If you want to make what you want to believe is Scientology a crime, then you might run into some opposition. 

Or like that texan republican committee in another reddit post, run into a problem when you say (like they did, as an example) that it should lose tax status for lack of a church creed, and find out that there has been church creed since it was started.

What you think we believe is very different from what we actually believe.

Edit: If you want to find out what we really believe, check out the new video channel at http://www.scientology.org

For a code of conduct, check out The Way to Happiness PSA videos. Very good production values, and some of them are actually funny. 

As a practical matter, if you disagree with any of the precepts, then I invite you to do better. I think that making a knowing decision about your own code of conduct is a worthwhile effort.

The hogtied rape victim is a BDSM myth, not a real world occurrence, though I suppose it has happened.

The reality of rape is that it ends with a broken victim, unrestrained and crying. No longer moving, no longer fighting, and staring into space thinking this can not be happening. They disconnect. They stop focusing on the violation taking place and the physical pain of the act taking place and simply try to survive it.

When it's over, they think back and wonder why they did that.

They did it because it is a survival mechanism built into us. Your job, God forbid this ever happens to a loved one, is to help them understand that *you* understand that the choices they made were the correct ones, and all that matters is they are there for you to love know.

The constant ""marijuana is safe and good for you"" spam is like watching a drunk trying to convince you alcohol doesn't impare their mental faculties, that it is harmless and can't lead to violence or dangerous driving.

Face facts, marijuana is a mind altering drug.  I don't care if a junkie thinks it is 'safer' than the other dangerous mind altering drugs out there.  It's still a drug that fucks with your mind.

Again, you're ignoring that the rate is growing much faster in the heterosexual population. Gay people are over-represented in the HIV statistics in part because if you go back 10 or 20 years, the rate was much higher in that community and many of them are fortunate enough to still be alive. 

But I'm not worried about getting HIV 20 years ago under the conditions that existed 20 years ago or even 10 years ago. If I were not in a stable monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner, I'd be worried about catching it in the 21st century, under the conditions that exist today.

Thus, a connection is formed in the person's mind, between pleasure, and pain imposed by someone who says they care about you.

*Off the topic, but still relevant for those concerned about this issue:*
Furthermore, such parents will often be rabidly anti-pedophile, and anti-nudity - because such an attitude gives them social leverage to make sure that no adult outside the family ever sees the bruises on their kids' rear ends. They honestly believe in their act of spanking - and they know they could lose their kids if others would ever see those bruises. They keep the threat of false accusation about pedophilia available as a backup plan, if they ever have a teacher or neighbor who calls them on the fact their kids have bruises on their butt: ""How did you see my child's butt?!"" they'd say. Some would be surprised at how old some kids are when they are spanked. It certainly can put well-meaning teachers in an awkward position. However, mandatory reporting laws for teachers and childcare providers, when it comes to suspected child abuse, mean that organizations which work with kids develop very detailed protocols which they follow, in order to protect their staff from false accusations.","1207022227"

If you have sex with someone who tells you that they have HIV, and you end up getting it too, well, sucks for you.

That's not true. A very small percent of jews are semites while virtually all arabs are semites.

That's clearly the wrong usage of the phrase and should be immediately dropped.

How would you refer to somebody who are anti-semite sentiment? As an anti-jew? Anti-broccoli? Anti-ocean?

Semite means semite. Anti semite means ""doesn't like semites"".

&gt;There is a similar term, anti-Arab, which is used to refer to animosity directed towards Arabs.

There are semites who are not arabs and there are arabs who are not semites.

I am sure the hatred of jews by arabs has nothing to do with forty years of occupation,  hundreds of dead arabs every years, building of settlements, destruction of houses, dropping cluster bombs, knocking out power generation facilities, embargoes, assassinations, torture, imprisonment without charges or trials or anything else.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I about wept tonight tears of joy. It was my first time actually doing jQuery after reading for a few days now on it. Tonight, however, I spent 3 hours between more research and writing actual jQuery code for my first time. I only had to write 22 lines of my own jQuery code. Given having to do this again, I probably could knock it out in 15-45 minutes on another project, if not less.

And the end result?

I drew an accordion menu on the left that automatically resizes to the window height, and when you resize the window again, the accordion menu resizes again, including accounting for the height of the header graphic. I attached a click event to the submenu items and then a custom handler for each menu item. Not a single line of quirky DHTML/DOM code was necessary -- everything was done in just 22 lines of jQuery, of which I probably could condense down to about 19 lines if push came to shove.

Cross platform testing? None necessary -- it's all done for me simply by using jQuery.

Funky DHTML/DOM quirk handling? None necessary -- jQuery handles it all.

No other Javascript framework has quite the organizational backing as jQuery, and unlike other frameworks that only give you cool widgets, jQuery gives you not only cool widgets, but a new way of doing Javascript/DHTML/DOM programming.

Once you spend a few hours learning it, you'll wonder why you never worked with it earlier. And the effects are rich and continuing to grow with it.

So, no matter what server-side language you work with, throw out your DHTML/DOM code and switch wholesale to jQuery. It's the difference of night and day.","1207023126"

I don't entirely disagree with you, but whatever the reasons or the degree to which food stamps pay for families' entire food budget, I do find it troubling that almost 10% of the US population feels the need to sign up for food assistance. I think 10% is just too high. The US as a whole ought to be more prosperous than for this to be the case.

To my knowledge, little has happened in development of programming languages and programming techniques for safety critical software in general. The SPARC subset of Ada (with annotations) is one of the few things that comes to mind. 

Even languages like Haskell that address type safity does not address things like strict control of memory usage and safe low level access to hardware, which is absolute requirements in most safety critical programming.

"business","t5_2qgzg","*Low unemployment and low inflation are central goals of stabilization policy.*

http://www.esi2.us.es/~mbilbao/nobeleco.htm

2006 winner, it looks like.

There are some benefits to low inflation.  it pushes people to invest money, it makes debts smaller.  assets gain value.  

coincidentally, the downsides of inflation hurt the poor and middle class the most, and i would think a small amount of inflation would do the same.  Having a small amount of people unemployed always means that workers have no leverage. Near where I live, I remember in 2000 that a local town (40K people) had banks paying bank tellers $10 an hour - normally this job where I live is about $7 an hour.  They still could not keep positions filled.  There were too many jobs, unemployment was about zero in that city.  

I am using Henry Hazlitt's 'Economics In One Lesson' as a source of a lot of what I am saying.  On the back cover it has quote from a 'Nobel Laureate in Economic Science' that basically promotes the book.  

The way he explains it, the 'classical economists' (Austrian Economics) have it right, but people always want to bend the rules, try and cheat the system.  this is Keynes and his theories, which much of our system is built on.

the system has been this way for almost 100 years, they will give out nobel prizes to people who figure out how to tweak their system to make it run better.  

overall though, it still makes the rich richer, and the poor poorer.

Cuba was more sensible.  It meekly agreed to a new constitution which stated in effect that the u.s. was the boss, and that cuba would be a good boy and do as it was told.  And so it did for many decades.

Then that bad communist guy castro came along.  He wouldn't take orders! even though cuba is like really close to the u.s., and they're like supposed to do whatever the u.s. says!!!!  So of course the u.s. had to impose an embargo and make life miserable.

Now the interesting question is what excuse will it use once the country moves away from communism?  My guess is that the u.s. will say that the sanctions stay in place until the government of cuba puts all the old american companies back in control of the cuban economy.

Back in the real world I'm looking at the actual numbers on HIV transmission efficiency, condom failure rates, and HIV prevalence, and reasoning inductively.

Data on transmission effiency is taken from here: http://www.ashm.org.au/pep-guidelines/

Receptive vaginal intercourse: 1/1000

(This number includes heterosexual population prevalence which is slightly higher in the UK but still around 0.1%)

Data on rates of condom failure: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom#Causes_of_failure

Condom failure is less likely with experienced users but I'll use the general population rate of 10%.

Prostitutes are highly likely to know about the availability of post-exposure prophylaxis and be able to access it. Failure rate of PEP with a single drug (an older protocol, these days a 3-drug protocol is used) is about 15%.

So our equation is 0.001 x 0.1 x 0.15 = 0.000015 or about one occasion in 66,666, requiring her to have sex 666,666 times (to produce that level of condom failure).

Please read the above.

The embargo is illegal - it is contrary to international law. The stated purpose of the sanctions is to ""bring democracy"" to Cuba.  Now keep in mind that the u.s. did not want a democracy in Cuba before Castro.  Instead, the u.s wanted a brutal military dictatorship.  ""Democracy"" was something the americans started asking for after the brutal military dictator batista was deposted.

The embargo is also illegal.  To put it in perspective, it would be like China putting an embargo on Taiwan ""until Communism is restored"".  The u.s. has no authority to place an embargo on another nation.  As a practical matter, the u.s. can get away with it, just like it gets away with lots of other things - Guantanamo Bay, rendition, CIA kidnapping and torture, detention of foreigners and even its own citizens without charge or trial, the war in iraq . .  . you get the idea.

  Ironically most people using Firefox today have never used the original Seamonkey codebase.  It makes those of use who used the original Seamonkey codebase before it turned 1.0 feel very old.

It is somewhat depressing that in a lot of ways the Mozilla project has gotten distracted from a lot of the original goals of creating a cross-platform standards compliant browser.

  While there certainly are ports of the Mozilla codebase on multiple platforms, Mozilla has added more variation in the UI on different platforms that make Mozilla less consistent across platforms.

  On the issue of standards compliance, Mozilla while still way ahead of IE, has fallen significantly behind Opera and even the Webkit team in adding new CSS support.  For the first couple years one would read about new support for xyz, but these days virtually every version is just a security or stability update.

I simply have a different point of view than you.  In my eyes a person who intentionally harms another without provocation is scum, an absolute waste of flesh.  To me death is no more than they deserve.  I understand that others may disagree, and hold human life sacred in and of itself for one reason or another. 

I don't think that a person should be able to do whatever they wish without a review of their actions.  I simply think that juries should be able to take motivation into account when deciding guilt or innocence.  That they are forced to convict a man when they feel he was right to do what he did is not justice, in my eyes.

And when it comes down to it, I don't think that the legal system works very well.  If a man rapes my fiancee, and she tells me he did it, but he is declared innocent in court then who should I trust?  Society would say the courts, but I would certainly take my fiancee's word over the opinion of the court.

The comment on ""hardly anyone agrees with you"" was meant to be taken -- ta, dah -- ironically. My point, if I must spell it out for you, is that there are few areas where zombie-think is more well established than the field of fundie-bashing. It's a bit of a cheap-shot industry with a large cadre of shooters talking to no one but themselves. So, your posturing about how uber-cool you are to have manned those barricades, is just a bit disingenuous given your comments about zombie-think. My God man, do you really think your fundie-bashing puts you in league with Spinoza et al.? 

More to the point, what are you suggesting re the Obama support movement? You're telling me that we shouldn't be getting behind Obama? We shouldn't be telling ourselves, and by extension, anyone else who happens to be eavesdropping, that it's 
obvious that Obama is going to carry the nomination? Obvious enough that the Clintonistas should sit down and shut up.

Frankly, I think it's time--and this is the point of posting this article--that we Democrats stop eating our young and start focusing on the real enemies. If you're paying attention, you're aware that in the past week or so TheOldWarrior has moved ahead of both Democratic candidates. Do you seriously think Mr&amp;MrsC's race-baiting hasn't played a role in that shift? We have Mr&amp;MrsC shouting from the rooftops that the black boy doesn't have the right stuff to be president, that maybe, if he shows he knows his place, we could let him run for VP. I've got to believe their murder-suicide pact has played a role in that shift.

We cannot have a former president, the leader of his party some would say, bashing the young star who is clearly the future of the Democratic party. We cannot have leaders of the Democratic party using thinly veiled racist comments as savvy politics. It's disgraceful and bordering on treasonous to the party -- a party that stood by them when he deserved to be tossed out on his sorry cracker ass, I might add.

The majority social metrics on any subject (with the notable exception of corruption) New Zealand falls in the same quartiles as US/UK. We've privatised everything. 

Do you have linkable data on Swedish vs other country's tax rates?

Is this wrong?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Income_Taxes_By_Country.svg

Welcome to New Zealand - which has the longest working hours (and highest levels of stress) in the developed world, and now has the least affordable housing. The reason there's a brain-drain to Australia is that wages here are piss-poor. What you gain in taxes you lose in income.

New Zealanders (generally) leave university under the weight of a huge student loan... which presumeably at some point morphs into a huge mortgage... but hey, at least we're not as bad as America where the mortgage will eventually morph into huge medical bills.

But the ""choice"" of what to buy is sacrosanct... even though the reality is that everything is privatised. Instead of paying taxes which go into infrastructure that your children will enjoy, it goes to profits that someone else's children will enjoy.

I used to live with a Swedish guy in London - he was in the middle of a music degree and was in london as part of some sort of work experience - the following year he went to drum-tech in LA... and this was provided for by the state.

I have comcast in my livingroom, but I got a brand new 1080P TV for the bedroom and didn't want to fork out another $20/month for an HD DVR.  I built an HTPC with a 1TB drive (about $450).  I loaded it up with every episode of every TV show I've ever somewhat liked and about 100 HD movies.  The bedroom is now a better place to watch TV than the living room.

Comcast sucks.  Even with its compression on SD channels I have a terrible problem with these odd vertical lines (generally with the color yellow in cartoons).

Tivo sucks too.  They charge ~$10/month for a service which should be free (even Microsoft doesn't charge for providing programming information).  AND Tivo has the audacity to advertise on every fucking menu screen possible.  What a bunch of cock-suckers.  Either advertise and don't charge, or charge and don't advertise.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I think you meant to write, ""hear hear,"" but as the intent is the same, leave us not quibble.  

What I meant is that your truly legitimate non-conformist *isn't* easy to spot on the surface because they often don't outwardly look any different from anyone else, their non-conformity not extending to matters of fashion (about which they often don't care, fashion being after all, essentially a function of dressing for the expectations of others) and having instead to do with a fundamental rejection of that which much of society holds dear.  In that sense, your non-conformist is not necessarily wealthy at all, and instead, is often poor inasmuch as the things that are important to them often cannot be purchased with money.  

And that makes sense if you think about it.  If what society in general holds dear is of little consequence to you, you're not going to expend much energy in trying to amass the means to attain it.  

As such, I argue again that non-conformists are generally not obvious on the surface.  They tend to be complex people such that a degree of intimate knowledge is required before their non-conformity becomes obvious.  

Long story short, in my opinion, you need to look far below a person's obvious surface features in order to know whether or not they truly are non-conformist as I define it.  (My definition being pretty simple; a non-conformist is an individual whose decisions with regard to what is and isn't important in life, are driven not by popular opinion, but rather, by their own analyses.)

  How good is the communication between the two of you?  That basically determines what options you have to deal with it.  
  While receiving flaming ignorance forwarded by someone that you have a real relationship with may make you uncomfortable, the rest of the relationship between you really has more to do with what is appropriate than anything contained in the trash forwarded.  
  Do you think she believes this, or did it just get forwarded because she was not really reading and thinking about it herself before she sent it?

It is also pretty interesting to note that the ""UI"" stuff isn't about Gecko, it's about the pending release of Firefox 3 (which is normal given this time of a product's release cycle).

Mozilla seems mostly to be coping with a codebase that is 10 years old; that may be the reason for such stalling in the years since Gecko 1.8 was in alpha. I'm actually much happier to see them focusing on this, since Gecko was getting very heavyweight and they needed to reduce this footprint for things like mobile browsers (PDAs/cellphones). They clearly *have* been working on the ""cross platform"" issues, especially with XULRunner and such.

I believe they have come a longer way than many people realize, yet I agree that it's tough to hang around and wait given their track record of ignoring some issues for years on end.

The web developer in me is excited about Firefox 3, because it means SVG applications will be feasible (version 2 is horribly resource-intensive for real application development).

It will be interesting to watch how gracefully (or not) Gecko continues to age in the light of Opera's Gogi and Webkit becoming mature.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You really don't get it.

&gt; This speaks nothing to the truth value of whether they would attack us if we left Iraq. 

Correct. But that's NOT what the second statement says. Reworded, the second statement says: If we stay in Iraq the terrorists won't attack us AND if we don't stay in Iraq the terrorists will attack us. If either one of those substatements is false, the entire statement is false, even if the other substatement is true.

In formal logic, the English construct 'either A or B' is equivalent to A XOR B.

    A XOR B == (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B)

Both parts are important. One half of the statement says that there is a danger if we aren't in Iraq and the other part says that the danger goes away if we are in Iraq. If either one of those parts is false then there is no point being in Iraq. Proving the first is impossible, but the second is easy to disprove... a single attack is enough to disprove it. It hasn't happened yet, but if we stay there for 100 years, killing innocent civilians, I can't see realistically how we won't be attacked again. It's just a matter of time before the falsehood of the statement is revealed.","1207025873"

Amundsen and his boys got to the pole over a month before Scott, were never in any kind of danger, and ended their trip in excellent health with vast quantities of stores to spare.  Everything Scott did wrong, Amundsen did right.  It wasn't an accident; Amundsen and his boys had years of experience in polar exploration and were smart enough to use Eskimo technology and sled-dog methods.  Scott thought that British-designed clothes would be better than the seal-skin Inuit parkas the Norwegians wore.  He thought that Siberian ponies would be better than Inuit sled-dogs.  He thought that British-made snowshoes would be better than Norwegian skis.  He was wrong, disastrously wrong, on all counts, and it's not as if he made his decisions in ignorance.  The evidence was right there before him and yet he ignored it.  

He was a product of one hundred years of British dominance.  The Rule Britannia was coming to an end, was bound to end in fire, and three years later at the Somme, the same sort of hubris that drove Scott forward in spite of all rational evidence to the contrary, drove a generation of young British men to die senselessly before German Machine guns.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Since you asked, I am indeed happy that Pedowar was banned from the server on which it once held residence.  Here me out. 

Consider this:  Everyone has his/her own opinion. As such, that opinion is correct by virtue of the fact that no one owns your thoughts other than you, the person who put forth said opinion. That's why a modifier of ""personal"" is often used before the noun.  It is opinion, not fact.  It is neither to be proved nor disproved.  It's the same concept as belief.  If you believe it, it's true.  It's simple logic, really.

These are my opinions:

1) I love the First Amendment.  Do what you choose to do. 

2) If people want to discuss legal minutia relating to varying shades of pedophiliac activity, go for it.  It's your opinion, own it.  Be proud of it.  Argue for it as much as you want. However, if you choose to do so, be a man of integrity.  Own it.  Sign your name to it without fear.  BE A MAN.  Anonymity is nothing more than an unintelligent slave of who you want to be.  So step up to the mic, state your real name and say your piece. Otherwise SHUT UP because your opinion will never matter.  You will never affect change because in all reality, you are too frightened to do so. 

3) Pedowar was a pro-pedofile site.  It was not simply a place to discus pedophiliac-esque activities.  All posts spoke of how the pedophile is being held down by The Man.  Deny it if you wish, but you know in your heart what is true.  If it wasn't, you'd sign your name to it and you wouldn't hesitate to show your mother.  By the way, people don't just sit around and discuss pedophilia and/or an inherent right to have sex with anyone you choose and/or the innate ability of children to grasp the concept of love and sex, and/or claiming that there is nothing wrong with a 20-year-old having a 10-year-old girlfriend.  

4) Your opinions are neither wrong nor right.  They are your opinions, and cannot be disputed.  Scientific-based studies are drive by decades of compiled research that include facts, figures, interviews, testimonials, victim impact statements, etc. These studies are conducted by physicians and assorted Ph.D.s. They are mixed and matched against the psychology of society, personality, and human nature in addition to the physiology of the human mind, body, and spirit. They are then reviewed by peers. 

5) The limit for a child to grasp concept is finite at any give age. They understand what they have the ability to understand. A sociopath does not understand limits based on norms that society has placed (it is what it is) on him/her.  They do, however, understand what is right and what is wrong based on the laws governing our country.  Subsequently, they choose to ignore the rights of others by whatever means necessary to achieve their goal/belief/desire/etc.  A child is a child.  A pedophile is a pedophile. So answer this: Do you believe in God or science? You cannot believe in one without denying (at least in part) the other.  Either way, both have laws.  These laws are made to protect people from those who give no concern to the law.  The are made to protect the inherent right of life without fear of harm from others. They are also made to protect those who do not have the ability to make informed and educated opinions.  All actions have consequence.  Your actions are your own unless you are forced or manipulated to do otherwise.  Do what you choose to do.  

Statement of Fact #1
The owner of Pedowar chose an action of placing a photograph of my six-year-old on his website, a website that in my opinion is pro-pedophilia.  He chose to make comments about my about my child. This constitutes a threat to me and my family.

Statement of Fact #2 
The owner of Pedowar chose not to publish his contact information on his Website.  Circumstance would have been different had he the integrity to do so.  He hides behind the First Amendment by attempting to remain anonymous, which is his right. However, he is not nearly skilled enough to hide himself from the WWW.  It took me about two minutes to find his name, address and phone number.  Any one who chooses to associate with him, surf his site and/or take his advice on anonymity should possibly get a second opinion. 

Statement of Fact #3
Never......and this is simple common sense people.......NEVER grab a photo of a child from a website, make overt remarks about sexuality, bring into question that ability of the parents to properly raise that child as they see fit and then publish the fricking link to the website from which you stole the photo.  C'mon, dumb ass.  The purpose of Website statistics is to track users.

Statement of Fact #4
I know you'll try, so start warming up those search engines.  However, I will not make it easy for you.  Please note:  Should you want to be lumped into the same category and should you want to be placed on the same lists (you know what I mean), make a move.  If I believe that you pose even the most minimal of threat to me or my family, game on.  I'm willing to bet that you have much more to lose than I. 

~ Believe It

As a side note, go ahead.  Say what you will and unleash your wrath of conjecture.   Make sure to include things like:   ""Practice what you preach and sign your name to your statement.""     ""Sounds like you're the unintelligent slave of who you want to be.""    ""Foul word Bla bla bla integrity bla bla bla foul word.""

For those who choose to merely see opportunity to once again defend your skewed beliefs, say what you will.  There is no reasoning with you.  You will never affect change until you hit bottom.  I would no sooner give you my name than I would sacrifice my child to your perceived truths.  When you have a child, you will understand.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I guess it depends on the sites you use.  Pretty much the very first thing I do now with a new Firefox installation is install NoScript.  Most of my browsing is reading text content rather than doing anything very interactive, so it doesn't bother me to whitelist the few sites where I really _need_ scripting to work.

An example of how it helps: my usual mode of reading a site like reddit is to pull up an article list and immediately open 10-200 of those links into tabs, for perusal over the rest of the day as I get time.  I have had cases where some linked-to article had a script on the page that chewed up CPU time or even crashed the browser.  It was just such a link from reddit (some blog with an asinine ""snowing"" effect over the text) that got me to install NoScript in the first place, and I've never looked back.","1207026440"
"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","It's not whether it's relevant to the syllogism, it's whether the syllogism is relevant to ""Truth.""

This is a modern problem within the context of, for example, the semantic web. Asserting this triple:

    &lt;Bob&gt; is-a &lt;Horse&gt;

Is very different from asserting this one:

    In the context of the fictional universe described in the book ""Bob the Horse"" {
      &lt;Bob&gt; is-a &lt;Horse&gt;
    }

Or, equally importantly, asserting this one:

    In the context of the web-page http://... {
      The author of ""Bob the Horse"" claims {
        In the context of the fictional universe described in the book ""Bob the Horse"" {
          &lt;Bob&gt; is-a &lt;Horse&gt;
        }
      }
    }

You might ask the system ""Is `&lt;Bob&gt;` a `&lt;Horse&gt;`?"" and it honestly wouldn't be able to tell you, because the system doesn't know what ""reality indirection depth"" you're currently floating at.","1207026450"

They would hesitate for a second too long or hold back just a bit, yielding to a baser instinct not to hurt a girl. Our boys were simply not playing full-out against this girls team.

And the actions of the boys are somehow the fault of the girls...Got it.

As an aside, one of my daughter's friends used to play soccer on a boy's HS varsity team. She quit after she accidentally broke a boy's shin. What happened was a pattern she had seen many, many times before. 

She told me that boys hold back a little because they're overconfident, then if the girl does better than they expect, they get mad and get very aggressive, and in this case, careless. The kid basically ran right into her as she was kicking, and took the brunt of it. If she had been a boy, the kid probably would have been more careful, but his emotions got the better of him.

She hung up her cleats after that. Even though she had every right to continue to play, she just couldn't. No telling how much in scholarship money it cost her, as the college she attends, like most highly selective schools, gives very little in merit scholarships.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Your logic has two major major flaws:

1. Enforcement
2. Results

Enforcement happens by controlling (in order of effciency)

- opportunity (real world capability and situation)
- motive (desires and incentives)
- consequence (reward/punishment)

The better the law, the less enforcement it needs. Natural laws don't need any enforcement and are the best laws there are.

Everybody comes with sexual organs naturally and meets other people. Meaning everyone has capability and situatios in which to have sex. So law enforcement in that area would mean mandatory castration/mutilation of evryone and/or isolation cells for everyone. Which means eradication of the human race and civilization.

Everyone has hormones naturally and the evolutional pressure to procreate, so everyone has incentive and desire to have sex. Virtually impossible to apply enforcement here. Law enforcement here means putting everyone on drugs and indoctrinate them to the level they don't want any sex anymore. Which also means the eradication of the human race and civilization.

Having sex in secret is comparatively easy, and even socially expected and enforced for the most part. So applying consistent and fair punishment here is virtually impossible without abolishing all privacy.

Now compare this with guns and murder/homicide.

You need to actively aquire a gun, a device designed to kill, to shoot someone. Killing someone then can be a complete impulse or reflect in a split second (whereas it is quite normal to have sex on an impulse, it usually takes longer than a split second to get to it). Meaning, controlling access to certain devices means means making it a lot harder , if not virtually impossible, for 99% of the population to kill someone without putting quite a lot of effort to it. Meaning easy opportunity enforcement.

Having good and fair wealth (re)distribution mechanisms for everyone and a reasonable social mobility for everyone leads to a good and peaceful social climate and sense of community, preventing the vast majority of incentives for violent crimes, leaving only crimes of passion (which are well controlled by making it harder to kill by controlling guns). So good motive enforcement too, if you have a non-currupt government that doesn't cater to lobbies, but tries to make it best for all.

And, a murder/homicide is enormously harder to hide than sex, since someone is will miss the victim, a corpse needs to be disposed and all kind of little problems arising from having killed someone. And you also have 3rd parties with potentially great damages from having lost a loved one or friend or someone they depend upon (whereas the greatest damage of a 3rd party in sex is usually hurt feeling sof 1 or two other people, but even that is  often questionable).

So that is only the enforcement side. I have hinted on the severity. Shooting someone has grave irreversible results for a lot of people. Having sex is mostly even neglegtable in the results is has for the ones directly involved.","1207026898"
"reddit.com","t5_6","Also, I presume, they are taking into account that since the moon is supposed to become a staging point for mars, astronauts would have to spend much longer periods on the moon than ever before.  The moon offers no protection against cosmic rays so it would be more dangerous than before because of the longer mission time on station.

This issue is so fundamental that it has always boggled my mind that the ""Mission to Mars"" ever got as far at it did.  Until this one gets solved, no one's going everywhere much beyond LEO for long durations.

BTW the ""obvious"" solution of adding shielding actually increases the radiation exposure because cosmic rays have such high mass and energy that atoms used for shielding only create a cascade of equally dangerous radiation when hit by a single cosmic ray particle.

Antisemitism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

""The term Semite refers broadly to speakers of a language group which includes both Arabs and Jews. However, the term antisemitism is specifically used in reference to attitudes held towards Jews. The word antisemitic (antisemitisch in German) was probably first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider in the phrase ""antisemitic prejudices"" (German: ""antisemitische Vorurteile"").[7] Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize Ernest Renan's ideas about how ""Semitic races"" were inferior to ""Aryan races."" These pseudo-scientific theories concerning race, civilization, and ""progress"" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as Prussian nationalistic historian Heinrich von Treitschke did much to promote this form of racism. In Treitschke's writings Semitic was synonymous with Jewish, in contrast to its usage by Renan and others.""

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;The physical abuse of the boys is directly attributable to the fault of the girls.

The only person who seems to have seen any ""abuse"" is one of the boy's moms. A woman already predisposed to blame females for male behavior. My daughter will assure you that moms see things differently from other people. 

So your soccer mom is hardly an objective observer. And as even she pointed out, the actual objective observers--trained referees who know what is acceptable and unacceptable in the sport and have no personal stake in the game but do have a professional stake in risk management for the companies they work for--don't seem to have seen things the way she did.

I can sympathize. When my kid drives, I feel like every car on the road is out to get her. But that doesn't mean they are, even if I write a blog post about it.

I was very good friends with a man who played football all his life, including a college bowl game. His mom told me that in his entire football career she saw 1 game. His first little league game. It looked to her like all 11 boys on the other side were coming straight for her son, and she just couldn't stand the anxiety, so she never went back. 

I hate to be the one to break this to you, pn6, but just because you read something on the internet, and just because it validates your preconceived notions, doesn't make it true. If kids were getting physically abused, the refs would have put a stop to it. The potential for a lawsuit if a kid is hurt is too great.","1207027586"

With hydroelectric any water you don't use accumulates in the reservoir for later use. Gas turbines are much cheaper than the gas to run them so you save on gas when the wind blows.

They are people. They all have lives, families, concerns, hopes, dreams, fears and worries. They care about this country as well and love it to the point that they voice and express their opinion via passive aggressive signs on their trucks. But they're people nonetheless, it's just so happens their views exists to serve them. 

And why shouldn't it? My time living in the midwest with midwesterner gave me a different perspective. Fox News isn't preaching to these people nor indoctrinating with these people. Fox News is resonating with them. They tune in to Fox News because living in the midwest, for good or bad, gives them a different world view.

Start with provable facts. Show them the aspartame study that proves it's cancer causing. Then show them who helped greased the skids for it to get into the food. Do the same for BGH. Another good thing to point out is the fact haliburton was a hairs breadth away from going bankrupt and then cheney gets in office and haliburton gets all kinds of cost plus and no bid contracts.

Unfiltered water from the euphrates, spoiled food, bad ammo...don't forget to remind him that it wasn't like this when logistics was in the hands of the army during WW2. Then point out who backs these soldier betraying companies. A couple of other things to point out is...Israel giving our nuclear secrets to Russia and our stealth secrets to china. don't forget about the 300 million made by a 23 year old kid buying subgrade ""commie"" bullets to sell to the U.S. army.

Show them the laws on the books. FOIA requests, etc. Use common sense. Don't talk about anything you can't prove. Show them exactly where the U.S. ranks in things like education, healthcare, etc.

Incidentally, the fact that the father refused to tell the other parent where he was spending his visitation with the kids should have been a huge red flag to the judge. So it's not like there was no indication of problems other than the death threats.

A parent who conceals information like that isn't willing to work in the kids' best interests, period.

If the guy didn't get enough time, the public weren't protected etc it is not because people are arrested for drugs it's because a) problems with sentencing and b) problems with rehabilitation efforts.

So no the answer to the crime issue is not to let some crimes like posession of illegal substances go unpunished.  And drug users are not arrested to fill up jails they are arrested for doing illegal things and for behaviour which endangers law abiding citizens.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The $3 Bill. Everyone should start carrying them!

I am STILL laughing!! I think we need to quit saving our $3 bills and bring them out in public.  The younger generation doesn't know they exist.

On my way home from work, I stopped at Taco Bell for a quick bite to eat. In my billfold are a $50 bill and a $3 bill.   I figure that with a $3 bill, I can get something to eat and not  have to worry about anyone getting irritated at me for trying to break a $50 bill.

Me: ""Hi, I'd like one seven-layer burrito please, to go.""

Server: ""That'll be $1.04. Eat in?""

Me: ""No, it's to go."" At this point, I open my billfold and hand him the $3 bill. He looks at it kind of funny.

Server: ""Uh, hang on a sec, I'll be right back.""
 
He goes to talk to his manager, who is still within my earshot.   The following conversation occurs between the two of them:

Server: ""Hey, you ever see a $3 bill?""

Manager: ""No. A what?""

Server: ""A $3 bill. This guy just gave it to me.""

Manager: ""Ask for something else. There's no such thing as a $3 bill.""

Server: ""Yeah, thought so.""

He comes back to me and says, ""We don't take these Do you have anything else?""

Me: ""Just this fifty. You don't take $3 bills?   Why?""

Server: ""I don't know.""

Me: ""See here where it says legal tender?""

Server: ""Yeah.""

Me: ""So, why won't you take it?""

Server: ""Well, hang on a sec.""

He goes back to his manager, who has been watching me like I'm a shoplifter, and says to him, ""He says I have to take it.""

Manager: ""Doesn't he have anything else?""

Server: ""Yeah, a fifty. I'll get it and you can open the safe and get change ""

Manager: ""I'm not opening the safe with him in here.""
Server: ""What should I do?""

Manager: ""Tell him to come back later when he has real money.""
 
Server: ""I can't tell him that! You tell him.""

Manager: ""Just tell him.""

Server: ""No way! This is weird. I'm going in back.""

The manager approaches me and says, ""I'm sorry, but we don't take big bills this time of night.""

Me: ""It's only seven o'clock! Well then, here's a three dollar bill.""

Manager: ""We don't take those, either.""

Me: ""Why not?""

Manager: ""I think you know why.""

Me: ""No really, tell me why.""

Manager: ""Please leave before I call mall security.""

Me: ""Excuse me?""

Manager: ""Please leave before I call mall security.""

Me: ""What on earth for?""

Manager: ""Please, sir.""

Me: ""Uh, go ahead, call them.""

Manager: ""Would you please just leave?""

Me: ""No.""

Manager: ""Fine -- have it your way then.""

Me: ""Hey, that's Burger King, isn't it?""

At this point, he backs away from me and calls mall security on the phone around the corner. I have two people staring at me from the dining area, and I begin laughing out loud, just for effect. A few minutes later this 45-year-oldish guy
Comes in.

Guard: ""Yeah, Mike, what's up?""

Manager (whispering): ""This guy is trying to give me some (pause) funny money.""
 

Guard: ""No kidding!   What?""

Manager: ""Get this .. A three dollar bill.""

Guard (incredulous): ""Why would a guy fake a three dollar bill?""

Manager: ""I don't know. He's kinda weird. He says the only other thing he has is a fifty.""

Guard: ""Oh, so the fifty's fake!""

Manager: ""No, the three dollar bill is.""

Guard: ""Why would he fake a three dollar bill?""

Manager: ""I don't know! Can you talk to him, and get him out of here?""

Guard: ""Yeah.""

Security Guard walks over to me and......

Guard: ""Mike here tells me you have some fake bills you're trying to use.""

Me: ""Uh, no.""

Guard: ""Lemme see 'em.""

Me: ""Why?""

Guard: ""Do you want me to get the cops in here?""

At this point I am ready to say, ""Sure, please!"" but I want to eat, so I say ""I'm just trying to buy a burrito and pay for it with this three dollar bill.

I put the bill up near his face, and he flinches like I'm taking a swing at him.    He takes the bill, turns it over a few times in his hands, and says, ""Hey, Mike, what's wrong with this bill?""

Manager: ""It's fake.""

Guard: ""It doesn't look fake to me.""

Manager: ""But it's a three dollar bill.""

Guard: ""Yeah?""

Manager: ""Well, there's no such thing, is there?""

The security guard and I both look at him like he's an idiot, and it dawns on the guy that he has no clue.

So, it turns out that my burrito was free, and he threw in a small drink and some of those cinnamon thingies, too.

Made me want to get a whole stack of three dollar bills just to see what happens when I try to buy stuff. If I got the right group of people, I could probably end up in jail. You get free food there,  too.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","Alright, first off.  Homeschoolers have to pay public school taxes along with the price of books and the paper work for home schooling.  Some libertarians opt for this method though for the reason you stated.  I've not heard of a single modern home schooler keeping their kids out of school to protect them from racial-integration, maybe it happens in the deep south but I've never met somebody who did that.

Also, I'm not a fundamentalist, I'm agnostic and don't hold any fondness for fundamentalists, I'm talking about home schooling.  There's a lot of bad shit out there in every belief system, I don't like fundamentalists for any belief system (that's right, fundamentalism doesn't just apply to Christianity).  Honestly, it's sounds like you're way too reactionary.  You might have been burned by religion, but I've had people try to ruin my life over it.  I've been sued, attacked, ostracized and had people try to get me kicked out of college.  Through all this I still see religious people (and these reactions were from Fundamentalist and liberal Christians along with quite a few Atheists) as human.  You seem to have completely dehumanized them (and yourself with them considering you seem more reactionary than most of the fundamentalists I've met).

Have you ever even met any home schoolers?  How many fundamentalists have you been friends with?  Before you make half-assed judgement calls based on what you've seen on the internet and the worst case scenarios in the news try meeting some of these people first and learn who they are.  There's no use hating them, then you're worse than they are (they may think you're going to hell, but they don't generally hate you or wish any harm on you).  Whenever I've met someone who's actions I couldn't understand I've tried specifically to get to know them so as to understand why they do what they do.  You seem to just find catchy words and apply them liberally.  Very few people are pure evil, most people try to do what they think is the right thing.  I bet you are trying to do what you think is right...but that doesn't give you or them leeway to be bigoted about it. ","1207028566"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The theory held by everyone at the time was that Cuba, following what John Quincy Adams called ""the laws of political gravitation,"" would fall into our hands like a ""ripe fruit."" Let's wait for the fruit to ripen and fall into our hands. That was precisely why the United States was always against Cuba liberating itself from Spain. The United States exercised enormous pressure on Mexico, Colombia and others to prevent Cuba's liberation. [Simón] Bolivar [known as ""the Liberator"" for his leading role in South American independence from Spain] was all too aware of this and was very saddened by it. But from the U.S. point-of-view, its position made sense. If Cuba achieved its independence, it would not fall into its hands like ripe fruit. They were also very worried about democratic tendencies and liberation movements in Cuba, which aimed to liberate slaves and struggle for equality for Afro-Cubans, all of which was intolerable for the empire. Therefore, for various reasons, the United States was opposed, from the early 1800s, to the liberation of Cuba. It maintained this position until, at the end of the century, it in fact conquered Cuba and made it a colony, under the pretext of liberating it from Spain. And it effectively continued as a U.S. colony until the government of Fidel Castro came to power in 1959.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I didn't say the risk was high, I just said that condoms are not 100% effective. You were _asserting_ that condoms were 100% effective, and thus asserting an unprovable negative.

Your calculation obviously must be wrong, because a significant (though low) percentage of prostitutes are HIV positive. If the risk was that low, hardly any would be.

Also, the level of AIDS in the heterosexual population as a whole is highly misleading. There can be _massive_ variation between social groups. For example, 1 in 10 gay men in London are HIV positive. It's quite probable that typical clients have a significantly higher infection rate than the overall population (not anywhere near 1/10, but still higher).

Anyway, this is all speculation. My argument was against the claim that condoms are 100% effective. All I originally said was ""the more sex you have, the more likely you are to get an STD."" How anyone managed to find something in that to disagree with, I can't fathom.","1207028623"

Say thanks to all the Muslims who put so much effort into separating Islam from some things we see in Islamic communities (and other, non-Islamic, Middle East communities), such as honor killings and other things we consider barbaric.

It's a shame, because we've borrowed many good things from Arabic cultures, not the least of which is our number system.  But no number system is worth the honor killings and female ""circumcisions"".  If it was possible for me to never know and/or encounter barbaric things like that, I'd give up the convenience of our number system in a flash.

I've seen far too many custody cases where either the mother or the father refuses to let the other parent where their children are and even denies court ordered visitation with little or no repercussions.

I agree that had all of the information been known at the time that the judge should have signed the order of protection.  But far too often I see orders of protection thrown around in messy divorce cases simply as ammo for more custody/more child support.  Going back to my original statement, I'm of the opinion that OOP's do little do stop the people that really wish to hurt others.  Perhaps I've just gotten too cynical.

In any case, it is terribly sad when any parent chooses to murder their children.  It's completely unfathomable to me.  I hope this guy rots in jail.","1207028713"

I don't believe that Chinese would allow him or anyone conduct a census, which can humiliate them and make world to unite against China.

You believe in statistics provided by China, i believe in Numbers given by Dalai Lama and Foreign journalists.

You think i believe in false propaganda ?
What about China's statistics, you think those are accurate ? without bias ? not propaganda ?

""If you have strong citations showing a population of 6 million Tibetans"" 
And no dude i am not wasting my time any further on you , who takes china's numbers seriously but finds Dalai's ""6 million"" as propaganda.

No dude, no foreign journalist or anyone else is allowed to roam freely, allowed to do their own census.

That is why i think can take Journalists words more seriously than that of China, who is stopping whole world to enter Tibet and report freely about the situation in there.

Nefelia, help me. Go and ask Chinese government to give you permission to conduct a census. That would solve our problem. :)

In all seriousness, when i see Tibetans kids who cannot speak or understand their own mother tougue. That is enough for me connect the dots.

But you should go ahead to check out ground reality in Tibet, as you cannot trust Tibetans themselves.

1) Foreign Journalists are not allowed.
2) Tibetans speaking Mandarin.
3) Ban on Dalai's pictures.
4) Crying Monks.
5) Tibetans protesting.
6) Journalists in Tibet and Tibetans themselves saying that Cultural genocide is taking place.
7) Chinese Gov. increasingly uses word ""Crush"".

But yeah dude ^ is all ""staged"", China's version is what we should trust.

What I call brainwashing is the too pervasive idea that any woman can hit any man at any for any reason with impunity, while no man is allowed to hit any woman.


&gt;Boys are not taught to hold girls in high regard in any meaningful sense. 

90% of schoolteachers are female, as well as 90% of daycare workers and babysitters.  The clear majority of children of both genders live in homes of divorced couples, and the clear majority of those are headed by the mother.

 Boys are, thus, much more likely to find that most of his time is organized by women and teenage female babysitters.

Secondly, boys are bombarded with shit such as the ""boys are stupid"" t-shirts, the ""women make the rules"" t-shirts, and ""teach him what not to it"" commercials. ","1207030354"

I didn't say lisp prevented having to juggle with various languages, what lisp (or other languages with extremely simple and regular syntaxes e.g. Smalltalk, Dylan, Forth, ...) do is make it less likely/harder to mix syntaxes and get confused between different languages. Because there is much less to remember, and the regularity of each language's syntax acts as a reminder.

You need to decide that you are really going to do it. Not ""I'll try"". But **""I am not a smoker. I will NEVER smoke. Smoking is something I do not do.""** This isn't something you can be ambivalent about; you have to commit yourself.

Set aside 3 days; a weekend is good. Make sure you have nothing scheduled, no responsibilities, and can shut yourself away. You're likely to be unpleasant company. 

Get rid of everything related to smoking. Smokes, ashtrays, lighters, etc. Don't just stick them in the house trash, you'll dig them out again. 

Buy some Nicorette gum or get patches. They'll help you through the worst. Be sure to read the packaging.

You might like some licorice, cinnamon sticks, or something similar to chew on; it helps to have something to fidget with in your fingers/mouth. 

Get a bunch of DVDs, download some movies, whatever. 

Start first thing in the morning. Don't have a smoke to start your day. And just spend the 2-3 days sweating it out. Stay calm, remember your commitment to yourself. You're not a smoker anymore. You're someone who doesn't smoke. You don't need it. There IS NO ""just one more"". Either sit back &amp; enjoy the movies or play games or read Reddit, or get active: working out, walking, etc. 

After 3 days, the nicotine is out of your system. It's all psychological from there, and gets easier as you go. Avoid parties/bars or wherever you used to smoke, for a few months at least.

Going on, infanticidal childrearing involves near-total neglect of children. And near-total neglect of children fails to produce psychological consciousness. In Western culture, consciousness only arose about 3000 years ago and the Greeks were VERY excited about it because it was NEW.

Furthermore, we know empirically that tribes such as the Piraha do not possess consciousness since they don't have any conception of time. They also lack numbers or in fact any abstraction. This means that instead of 60% of their population being brain-damaged and subhuman, 100% of it is.

They have no psychological consciousness and the only thing they could hope to aspire to would be a degraded form of psychological consciousness.

They don't ""worry"" in the sense of having some internal preference for movie stars over hard news.  They *do* worry about what will generate ratings and profits--if the general public gave a shit about crimes committed in the name of freedom, that's what we'd see.  *WE* worry more about the movie stars--""we"" meaning the american public as an aggregate, not reddit.  

There are more serious news sources for anyone who wants them, there always have been, but they appeal to a minority and are not going to fill the space in popular culture occupied by what's called MSM.   The MSM shows what the largest demographics want to see, and it dynamically changes content to keep showing what most those people want to see.  It might frequently alienate a large minority of potential viewers, but only a minority.  For economic necessity, it keeps showing what the majority rewards, and that isn't ""serious"" journalism. 

Whether that can be changed is uncertain, but mistaking the source of the problem so completely--pinning the motivation for fluff news on the MSM itself rather than on the viewers it services--guarantees it will not.

It's true, there are problems with markets *if the property rights are set up correctly*, but in my opinion they can't be fixed without either changing human nature or finding a way to predict the future.

Total population / percentage of malnourished children:

* **Africa**  estimates range from [.89b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_continents_by_population#Area_and_population) to [.93b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_population) / sub-Saharan Africa, the worst, averaged [30% underweight children](http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=75521).

* **India** even without Bangladesh's .15b is [1.1b](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html#People) people / 47.5% underweight child rate in 2006.

If you feel comfortable extending the underweight statistics to the adult population we get:

* 30% of .94b = 282,000,000
* 47.5% of 1.1b = 520,250,000 (with Bangladesh included, it would be 590,375,000

As promised, I will merely substitute India for Africa in your original comment now, and let you decide if the statement makes sense regarding worldwide *political* origins of hunger.

&gt;*I think a lot of world hunger is as political as it is due to existing world infrastructure.*

&gt;*If everyone in India stopped fighting, and then if most able bodied people in India started working -- do you think starvation would continue to be a serious problem in the long run? The truth is, India has abundant natural resources, and it is warfare, racial division, corruption and the leaders' oppression that prevents them from living good lives.*

India ranks 35th on 2007's economist's democratic [index](http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/democracy_index_2007_v3.pdf)(pdf). South Korea and Taiwan are 31 and 32, respectively. India's unemployment rate was recently estimated in the [7%s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India#Occupations_and_unemployment), compared to [Sub-Saharan Africa's 9.7%, North Africa/Middle East's 13.2%](http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:EiBcExtgm2MJ:ilo.law.cornell.edu/public/english/bureau/inf/pr/2006/1.htm+africa+unemployment+rate&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6), and the [E.U. which ranged from 6.9 - 7.9%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union#Unemployment). Given that their last war was in the 1960s, which of your claims accrediting hunger's genesis to political machinations apply:

* warfare
* racial division
* corruption
* unemployment

By ""confiscating"" the word semite the jews have  convinced everybody that they are a race rather than a religion.

&gt;Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize Ernest Renan's ideas about how ""Semitic races"" were inferior to ""Aryan races."" These pseudo-scientific theories concerning race, civilization, and ""progress"" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as Prussian nationalistic historian Heinrich von Treitschke did much to promote this form of racism. In Treitschke's writings Semitic was synonymous with Jewish, in contrast to its usage by Renan and others.""

Even more of a reason to discontinue to use the term anti semite to mean anti jew.

Obviously all violence from palestenians towards israelis is 100% justified because people have the right to defend themselves from occupying armies and the right to fight for their freedom and their children's freedom.

By the same token the violence by hezbollah towards israel while israel was occupying lebanon was also 100% justified.

Sure, I have Nintendo. Bring snacks. You can burn it down after some smash brothers. I won't think less of you if you are good at it.  

&gt;A few free whacks with a 2x12?

Fair enough, that would teach me not to assault random people with no clear evidence. You can even use a flaming piece of my house.

Allow me to limit this awesome fantasy to that scenario instead of imagining that I am either a lunatic that will target random people on thin evidence in order to vent my primal fury, *or*, that I am going to get all CSI/Miami with an electron microscope in my ""vendetta wagon"" and a baseball bat in my back pocket (with fabulous sunglasses in the breast pocket of my smart blazer.)

"business","t5_2qgzg","I don't get it. Why do the drivers have to pay for the gas? It's the company's truck.

Okay, so let's say I own the truck. There are many businesses where if things go up in price, the owner must then turn around and pass that cost on to the consumer. They buffer it for a little while until it eats too much into their margin, and then they pass that cost on to the customer. They don't just shut the doors on the customer. And that's essentially what the independent truck driver is doing, which is stupid.

Also, it's not really the fuel cost going up. It's the speed of the falling dollar that gives the illusion of higher fuel costs. The falling dollar is because the Fed has to print more cash right now to give the central banks more power to ride out bad loans. And the bad loans were because the central banks made a gamble on how much bad debt they could risk and lost. And the homeowners who gambled with $500K - $2M houses on variable rate mortgages also lost.

So, it's a bubble, and it doesn't justify raising trucker pay because the Fed (hopefully) will eventually control the dollar and prices will go back down again. If we raise trucker pay, then that means that when the economy bubble passes away, the trucker pay remains too high and we have another source of inflation.","1207036267"

"programming","t5_2fwo","You don't have to guess, there's an overview in the article that comes from http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=41053#c125661

Looking at the source code:

 * A zval is a union that can hold anything up to a double (8 bytes), a refcount (4 bytes), and two flags (2 * 1 byte).  Then of course a C compiler will pad that to align on a 4 byte boundary, so that's 2 more bytes = 16 bytes.
 * A hash bucket has a long ""Used for numeric indexing"" (4 bytes), a key length (4 bytes), 2 data pointers (2 * 4 bytes), it looks like 4 pointers for doubly-linked lists (4 * 4 bytes), and the actual key itself (at least 4 bytes) = 36+ bytes.
 * And a heap block header has the length of the previous (4 bytes) and next (4 bytes) heap blocks = 8 bytes.

I'm curious as to why an integer would need a hash bucket, personally...  but not enough to figure *that* out from the code.","1207036471"

(i.e. all religions ultimately lead to same god.)

Also, I don't think most atheists will find themselves debating with hardcore conservatives/creationists etc. Hardcore conservatives are too dumb to construct/understand coherent arguments..or sentences. Most of the religious people you will have this discussion with (if ever) will be (or pretend to be) pseudo-religious pantheists who will keep twisting and turning their definition of ""god"" till finally trying to convince you of the Einsteinian God (Spinoza's God).. And when you concede that there is some beauty in the laws of physics/ universe/science which can be ""spiritual"", somehow that is supposed to mean ""they"" won that debate..

I have had this discussion with several people ( mainly with political and social liberals like me; friends from grad-school, family members etc etc) It gets boring.. I entertain myself by evangelizing for the Church of the Holy FSM (the one *true* god..)

I've never used pdb (or any other python debugger) - since I was curious, heres a decent looking tutorial on it: http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2005/09/01/debugger.html

When I've been troubleshooting reasonably long scripts (say, over 100 lines), I generally create a debug() function within the script or class. The function checks of ENABLE_DEBUG == True, and if so, prints the supplied message
    ENABLE_DEBG=True
    # ...
    def debug(msg):
        if ENABLE_DEBUG:
            print msg

Only the member banks can own the shares, you and I cannot own these shares. The shares pay dividends. These aren't magical dividends, they are paid by taxpayers. The government aka you and me pays the fed those interest payments which the fed looks at as income. But you might say the fed worked hard for this! But the fed had the U.S. treasury print up money for the government in order to get these interest payments. Then others say.. but the fed pays the government back. But only after it has paid off the member banks.

And those corporations aren't faceless organizations, it's the owners of those member banks, the executives, who make a tidy sum. Who are they? The old money, the JP Morgan family, Rockefellers(Chase), Mellons, Carnegies. The fed was drumed up by JP Morgan to profit from taxpayers vs having all these little pesky non-NY banks reap profits. And JP just made out pretty well thanks to the fed. Got BS for $10/share(tried to get $2/share :( ) and got a nice forgiveable $30 billion loan to take care of debt.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Didn't you read anything I wrote? It seems like your idea of debating is just insulting people and contradicting what they say.

&gt;Since wars are good for the economy, but bad for human life, why doesn't America and Japan sign a deal with each other, stating that each country will spend trillions of dollars building the most advanced warships ever designed, with lots of missiles, nukes, radars, all the bells and whistles.

They do! Didn't you ever read 1984? You just described a major plot point perfectly.

You don't need war to use the military as a social spending program, though it certainly accelerates the spending. The US more or less already does waster billions of dollars on useless defense systems, just as you said. there are entire towns employed by companies like Lockheed.

The US military is basically an enormous civil spending program. It's given millions and millions of people the tuition they needed to get through college. Most commercial airline pilots got free training (that would otherwise be massively expensive). Guys like Kos of DailyKos started their careers in the military.

The internet is a creation of the US military spending. Many important inventions have come through military and space programs (NASA).

&gt;Doesn't it make more sense, you fool, to think that all those people would be better off spending their time producing actual wealth like medicine, food, and housing?

Actually, it does. I never said it didn't. Many socialist countries do social spending based on these efforts rather than on the military, which is the only social spending program in the US that can constantly get funding for through congress. Even Republicans will rubber-stamp whatever they buy.

Japan is somewhere in between. The government throws all its money into construction, and all the people that didn't make it to college and might otherwise be unemployed have on hard hats. It used to be a good idea, but now they're starting to build bridges to nowhere.

Anyway, war is social spending that comes at the cost of killing people in another country. That's not good, and I don't condone it. But while the US debt that Bush is racking up is a major issue and hurting the dollar, the war in and of itself is actually not that bad for the economy and in fact actually probably helped slightly. Does that make it right, or mean the money couldn't have been better spent? Of course not. But the point still stands.

When you answer, try to evolve beyond ""You're an idiot"" and ""No that is NOT true""-level answers. It's a really primitive, boring level of debate.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;&gt; How to change this? Fix government.

&gt;You can't do this without changing the culture. You aren't going to get anywhere when Americans think that corruption is perfectly alright and acceptable.

Then let's change the culture. It's not as hard as you think. It's certainly easier than changing business. Businesses react exactly the way you would expect them given their environment and incentives. Neither inherently good nor inherently evil - just selfish. Now THAT is something that is really hard to change. Much harder than changing culture.

What we need is to change the environment and incentives in which business (both big and small) operates. Government is a big part of that environment. Government can create all kinds of incentives. Now I don't think Obama is the second coming and he still has a lot to prove, but I definitely think he has the potential for doing exactly what you suggested: changing the culture. If a candidate with a real chance claims on TV that he didn't take any money from lobbyists he has already changed the culture a little. By getting young people involved and proving that it is not true that they don't care he has changed the culture a little.

&gt; I never did find technical details of the IFR so I always confused it with MSR. Can you help me distinguish them?

http://www.geocities.com/rmoir2003/ecm_R.pdf

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_Fast_Reactor

&gt; The other thing is that ""inflation"" as a concept is a bunch of propagandistic crap. What exactly gets inflated?

The supply of money. Money is subject to the same rules of supply and demand as anything else. It's just a little harder to see because value is usually measured in money, leading to the ""rubber ruler"" problem. The consumer price index (if calculated in a statistically honest way) is supposed to be a n approximation for the ""true"" value of things, regardless of fluctuations in supply and demand of money.

So where does inflation come from? 

Unless you use something of inherent scarcity (e.g. gold) as money that is nevertheless produced continiously in limited qualtities you will need some artificial means of creating more money to keep up with the expansion of the economy. The problem is that once you have such artificial means set up it's hard to resist the temptation to overuse it and create more money than necessary (and tweak the CPI to try to hide it). 

Another issue is that the current system for creating money is based on governments letting banks do it by engaging in accounting practices that would be considered illegal if attempted by anyone else. If governments are sponsoring this activity (by refraining from jailing the officers of certain anointed businesses called ""banks"", supposedly in return for getting extra oversight over them) then why can't they just skip this middleman and issue the money directly? 

I don't have an issue with anyone lending money he actually has (i.e. created something of value in order to get) and charging interest as compensation for the risk of default and the opportunity cost of not doing something else with it during that time. But the fractional reserve system means that banks lend money they *don't have* and get to *collect interest on money they don't have*. When people put that borrowed money in the bank it gets lent again and again and collects more interest. Banks get to collect far more interest than the fair market value of the service they perform. Why on Earth should governments sponsor this kind of activity? 

The answer, of course, is historical precedent and the fact that a few big banks are holding all the world's governments by the balls. 

&gt; But there is NOTHING wrong with wage inflation

Wage inflation (i.e. wages rising faster than CPI i.e. rising standard of living i.e. a proxy variable for ""happyness"") should be a goal. It's something the government should manipulate the markets in order to achieve. But I would include benefits and tax breaks, not just wages. Canada has shown that the only way to prevent the middle class from shrinking the way it does almost all over the world is to support it directly in the tax structure.

The free market is phenomenally effective in efficient use and allocation of resources in the micro- and meso- level. There is no proof that at the highest macro levels it will tend to produce the most desirable outcome for society. That's where government should step in and very gently and with great respect for the way the market works prod it in that direction.

&gt; Warehousing costs.

I used gold in my example only to get inflation out of the equation. The costs of warehousing money is a row in a database somewhere.

I don't get your arguments for negative interest. I don't think opportunity costs are ever negative. When is it ever better to do nothing rather than to do something? I agree that some things people do ARE worse than doing nothing and destroy economic value instead of creating it. But ON AVERAGE doing something is better. Each hour of your life has value. That is the ultimate scarce and unstorable resource. ","1207040969"

Credit: Expedition 16 Crew, NASA

Explanation: In a surprising and potentially troubling request, the new space station robot known as Dextre demanded that astronauts refer to it in the future at ""Dextre the Magnificent."" Brandishing power tools that would make any handyperson blush, the mobile servicing system thanked humans for creating it and promised a glorious future where humans would retain an important role in the new robot order. Happy April Fools Day from the folks at APOD. The classic fable of humans mistakenly creating technological evildoers dates back to Frankenstein and includes famous fictitious villains such as HAL and the Terminator. Dextre, although real, is no Frankenstein, since its computer intelligence is mainly geared toward allowing astronauts to control it remotely. Dextre was deployed last month to help build and service the International Space Station. As seen in the above picture, Dextre is truly a technological marvel, wielding long arms capable of handling both small tools and large modules with precision dexterity. ","1207041110"

I built an HTPC, so we can download or stream lots of different content from NetFlix, Hulu.com, and iTunes.  And it's got a BlueRay drive, so we can watch HD movies from NetFlix.  And, our local library, just a few blocks away, has a huge DVD selection.

I can't imagine finding enough hours in the day to want to add another couple dozen channels to the mix.

why does it resonate with them?  because these people are usually ignorant to the truth and many times they choose to be.  most people who get their news on sites like this or sites like the internet dont like fox because they are more informed, hence the term 'faux news'.  we all know its a pro govt propaganda network.  the evidence is there if you choose to look.  

the racists and sexists of the 50s/60s all had hopes, dreams, fears, and worries.  their worries were women being independent and their fears were black people.  just because people are good in many areas doesnt mean they cant be ignorant, closed minded, and guilty of refusing to see the truth about a situation.  im not calling for anyone's execution here and there are a great many liberals who are guilty of the same thing - over illegal immigration (i live near the border and i see the reality of how illegals screw this place up, but liberals sipping tea in new york see it differently because they are ignorant of the situation).  

i hate partisanship and i know it was only created to keep the people divided and to help the two parties profit and retain power.  i hate democraps and republitards EQUALLY, both parties should be abandoned.  but faux news = faux news = faux news = cnn = abc = nbc = cbs = corporate censored news.  fox news is just the most obvious about it because people like the above truck driver ASK for it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Some countries don't have plentiful water supplies.

And that's exactly why wind has a limit on the share of the energy mix it can comprise. Not everyone has enough on-demand power to balance the variability of wind.

I expect that some countries will build more wind power than their energy grid can support. This will lead to a lot of sweat in control rooms, and eventually to large blackouts and political backlash.

&gt; In the same way that water can saved for when it's needed, so can uranium.

The cost of nuclear fuel is insignificant compared to the energy it contains. When we switch from Uranium to Thorium the fuel costs will be even less than that.

The costs of nuclear power are almost entirely in infrastructure and that is proportional to peak power capacity, not to the actual energy produced. You want to run a nuclear power plant at 100% at all times. Load-following is difficult.

Wind+hydro is good. Wind+gas is good.

Wind+nuclear is no more effective than nuclear alone. The wind component would be simply a waste of enormous amounts of cement, steel and human effort.

Hydro+nuclear works nicely. Even if supply is stable, demand isn't. You can use nuclear for base load and hydro for demand peaks.","1207042455"

Remember the OIC only has 15 out of the 47 votes required, and it wasn`t even a close vote at 22-7 vote. Don`t blame them, blame the other western nation for (stupidly) abstaining from the vote, or to have at least called for the inclusion of all religions.

My problem with most CD's is the mastering process. The whole loudness wars thing really gets under my skin. I feel it has raised the over all standards of the amount of desirable compression for digital mastering. Vinyl as an inferior medium fortunately limits the amount of loudness that it can handle resulting in a mastering process that I feel generally does the music more justice.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Here's a question (any *QI* researchers reading?  This one's for when you reach 'S'). Who was the first man to reach the South Pole?

If you're lucky enough to visit Amundsen/Scott base today the first thing that you do is visit the official South Pole marker and have your photo taken.  It's a silvered globe that marks the *Geographical* pole, that is the point at which the lines of longditude converge (the actual point of rotation wobbles around the general area somewhat depending on the time of year).

Amundsen and his team reached the pole on December the 14th 1911 and set up a tent base, which they named *Polheim*.  They'd broken their theodolite on the journey and their primary concern, understandably, was getting home alive so they had little time and inadequate equipment to identify where the pole actually was.  What they decided to do was to 'box' the pole:  they marked a 10 mile square around where they believed the pole was and skied grid lines across it.  After this they spent a few days taking readings, moving forward to their newly calculated pole position and skiing more grids.

It turns out that *Polheim* was about 5.5 miles from the actual pole and that one of Amundsen's team members Helmer Hanssen was the one who skied closest, getting to a couple of hundred yards of the geographic pole. Amunden himself probably never got closer than a kilometer (though we should remember at this point that Amundsen's feat was one of the greatest geographical achievements of the 20th century and that he led his team there and back safely).

Scott and his team got as far as the *Polheim* tent and, as they now realised that they had been beaten and were in poor shape, turned round and started for home.

Nobody returned to the pole for some 45 years until Admiral Byrd led an airbourne expedition in 1955.  This flight landed in the general vicinity of the pole to scout for the setting up of a permanent base the following year - the International Geophysical year.  The IGY base was intended to do science and beat the Russians.

So who was the first there?  Well, you could make a case for it being an American, Lt. Dick Bowers (no relation to Scott's Bowers, I believe), who on November the 20th 1956 led the airdropped team tasked with identifying 90 degrees South with modern instruments for the IGY base and was the man who erected the first marker.  

Paul Siple, the expedition's chief scientist, took the first silver globe (originally a photographic lens for taking atmospheric pictures).  One of these days I must dig up a copy of his out of print book on the expedition to see if it sheds any light.","1207043356"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Seems like you want something like Wireless priority service on cell phones. That is to say that certain senders will have priority in emergencies. 

A network broadcast or flow oriented approach would have the same problems as QoS solutions like intserv and diffserv. That is agreement across autonomous networks that those packets will be given priority, which is effectively impossible to do. 

Probably the best approach is a distributed P2P network that uses a gossiping protocol to distribute the emergency message across the network. Security would be complicated only by making sure that the message originators were authorized to send messages on the network.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I find that inspiration to use a new language comes first from an impulse to think ""there's got to be a better way to do X"". I've tried out some other languages and it's amazing how things that took a lot of code and looked convoluted in a more popular language were just drop-dead simple in the obscure ones. Maybe you were referring to using other languages like Ruby, Python, Perl, etc., and that you found satisfactory solutions there, and so there was no need to look to Lisp. If so, I see your point.

If you look at it differently, though, thinking about what would provide a ""home"" for your software such that it would be able to grow gracefully as demands (requirements) on it increase with time, then I think Lisp or some of the other symbolic languages are worth consideration. Too often developers look at ""what language will handle my current problem?"" without thinking, ""What kind of lifetime is this software going to have?"" Is it still going to be around 40 years from now? Why not? People who wrote software in the 1970s didn't think their stuff was going to last a decade, yet there it was when people were worried that it wouldn't handle the Year 2000 properly. Some software just sticks around. Usually what happens is it accretes features as demands on it grow. On some platforms the answer is to just do a rewrite. This can create its own problems, but this tends to clean up the gathering cruft. But on a lot of systems, after years go by it becomes quite a mess using typical dev. tools, chosen because someone thought at the time, ""What dev. tool is most appropriate to the problem"" they had a few decades ago. The people who come after in all likelihood end up using the same dev. tools, or updated versions, because it's what was compatible with the old stuff. The project grows and grows and gets more unwieldy, because structures end up being built to express things that the language wasn't designed to express. So a kind of ""language"" ends up being built that's only somewhat visible in things like function calls and such, but it's not expressed in a language that's really discernable. And so it gets confusing, because you get distracted by the structures that are being built and maintained, and it's difficult to focus on the problem you're actually supposed to be solving.

What I think makes Lisp nice is that you can mold it to your needs. You can modify it. The potential I see with it is that you can get it to express what it was not able to express before, thereby creating a discernable language to deal with new problems that the language knew nothing about when you first started using it. Your software can ""grow into it"" without running into barriers that you have to circumvent by having to construct and manipulate data structures directly.","1207043883"

Yes, that would be the amplifier. The important thing is to get the audio in digital form to the amplifier which almost always is capable of doing the digital-to-analogue conversion with superior quality compared to the computer.

This is of course assuming that one has an amplifier. In case of passive plastic boxes (sometimes a.k.a. computer speakers) with no volume control there is no amplifier.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; 1) Prototype based OO is strange

Funny thing - I've only looked at io briefly but found prototype based OO to be something I'd been looking for for years without quite realising it. I frequently run into situations in python where I want to be able to dynamically declare classes (e.g. generating structures for ORM scenarios) and although there are things you can do, it's not nearly so easy as in io. Not sure if the mechanism is similar in javascript.

&gt; string manipulation is somewhat important

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Lloyd deMause's History of Childhood. Or if you want an uncontroversial and incontrovertible teaser then how about Alice Miller's [Political Consequences of Child Abuse](http://www.naturalchild.org/alice_miller/political.html).

It isn't an innate trait of the human species to be caring and protective. Humans developed from apes and apes are brutal, violent and uncaring rapists. Caring is something we developed as the lynchpin component of civilization.

In hunter-gatherer societies, infants have no mothers per se. They certainly have no fathers whatsoever.

The women nurse the infants in order to get a sexual thrill out of it. Once they're about four years old, they're discarded like used up sex toys and then they overwhelmingly die.

Oh yeah, you know about how everyone talks about the universal ""incest taboo""? That's not what's universal man. It's incest that's [universal](http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/06a1_incest.html) and the further back you go in history, the more of it there was. Same thing for violence, same thing for neglect, same thing for rape, same ...

Of course, all this is ""controversial"" because anthropology is not a science. It isn't a field dedicated to truth. It is an ANTI-science, dedicated to the political project of humanizing their subjects. So quite often, they spread the precise opposite of the truth.

But every so often, they let slip the truth. So the truth about the piraha is that mothers don't teach babies language the way we do, by cooing and talking to them. Instead, they sing while working, constantly, and staring off into empty space. Meaning: they don't pay attention to babies and they *don't match gazes with them*. This by the way, is a reliable way to crush empathy to nothing.","1207048814"

It is perfectly clear where the threat to free speech is coming from. Blaming LiveLeak is like saying that girls who get raped are responsible for making the world a dangerous place for other girls. It's a non-sequitur.

And neither does the title state that LiveLeak is a threat to free speech, It simply states that this whole affair is a sad day for free speech. Which it is. But it is not so because of LiveLeak's action, but because of the actions of those making the threats. Besides, the final sentence in the title is from LiveLeak's offical statement, isn't it?

The *threat* to free speech does not emanate from the person or organisation suffering the intimidation - but from those who are making the threats and who *are* opposed to free speech (which LiveLeak clearly isn't)!

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Workers get paid little for hundreds of other shoe and clothing brands and workers go on strike at their factories from time to time.  However, simply because it's Nike, the anti-Nike crowd climbs out again.

We should be grateful that we can have a big brand responsible for making sure they use suppliers their customers are comfortable with.  To protect their brand they have to make sure of that.  If you buy shoes from a non-major brand you have no idea what made those shoes and under what conditions.

Also, these shoes are made on contract.  Nike spend millions on the design and marketing, and distribution.  They are in the business of contracting the manufacture of shoes out to suppliers who normally bid for it.  Nike makes less than 7% profit after the payment to suppliers, marketing, R&amp;D and distribution costs are covered.

When selecting suppliers they take cost, reliability and quality into account, but they also make sure they operate legally and ethically.  The board of Nike doesn't wake up in the morning to go to work thinking up ways to make poor people suffer, they think of ways to keep their brand in business and loved by people so they can buy their products.","1207050110"

It wasn't until the false outrage generated by online proxies about ""racial statements"" in SC, both rallied the large African American population around the campaign, and eased the way for large scale intimidation on the ground among the same group, that we started to see some small push back against the Obama media machine.

This was followed of course by the all important ""game changing"" endorsements from Mr. Establishment Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, and Patrick Duval which led to a 15 point win for Hillary in MA, as well as the oh so important Maria Shriver endorsement in CA that led to a 10 point Hillary win there.

Most doctors in national health care systems have much, much higher quality of life than doctors in America.  If you don't have student loan debt which is as much as a second mortgage, then you don't have to earn as much to be happy.  If you are not expected to work 80 hours a week, lifestyle is also better.

Giodudes reply to you is also important to consider.

For many of us doctors, we are just tired of seeing people get crap for care because they can't afford it.  Let me state it differently, if you get sick enough in the American system, eventually the system will suck you dry.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","God I wish I had a computer of my own to refute most of these points. Yeah, I understand that the PS3 is harder to code for than the rest of the current generation of consoles, but using that as an excuse to blame Sony is honestly the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Every generation gets a significant technical leap (or so we'd like to think), and this one's no different. The problem would be the developers, because while, yes, the coding is hard, games are now a multi-BILLION dollar business, and if they want to have a chance at success, they had better get off their lazy asses and learn how to work with it. Maybe you think I'm being a bit harsh, but face it, computer programmers are up there as far as well-paid jobs go, and developers who create a great game that does well in the market end up filthy rich. There's no room for laziness and whining about the difficulty of your console in an industry that thrives on innovation.

And speaking of the price issue: I, for one, got my PS3 (60g) about 4 months after it came out, for about $500. What I got for $500:

PSN access

A computer (Install Other OS feature + 
external hard drive if you so choose)

Bluetooth capable everything

Yes, Blu-Ray, the format that ended up winning the 'war', just as I yelled about since its inception

Games like crazy. I don't understand this 'no games' argument; The launch _did_ blow, as far as that goes. We had Resistance, we got Virtua Fighter 5 soon after (Without internet play because of DEVELOPER LAZINESS), MotorStorm blew people away.. Maybe it's just me, but a 3 AAA games seems like a decent enough lineup for the first few months of a console's lifespan. 

Oh, and don't get me started on Microsoft's lame-ass strategy, aka, repackage the Xbox, upgrade all the hardware, rush that shit out of the warehouses at Mach speed and to hell with Quality Assurance, and beat Sony to the punch. Flood market with shovelware, release maybe 1 decent game a month.

And as far as I could tell, when the PS3 came out, the best MS could muster up was Gears of War (admittedly great, though could have been 10x better if it had been developed for the PS3)..and what else? Nothing else really comes to mind. Halo came out after the PS3 released, so almost a year old the 360 didn't exactly have a star-dazzling list of awesome games, now did it?

Oh, and I forgot about the pricing. 360 at the time of PS3 launch was about $299, was it not? Maybe even $399. HD-DVD player add-on? $150. Hard drive, which is required in order to play pretty much anything? Something like $50.

HMM $600 and the SAME features as the PS3, differences between HD-DVD and BRD notwithstanding..oh, except for one tiny little bitty point...

XBOX LIVE MEMBERSHIP. 1 YEAR = ~$60

So tell me again about how the PS3 would have been a bad investment compared to any of the other consoles out at the time? The Wii was the only one worth the money, judging by your logic.

And I still don't see how it's Sony's mistake. Also, sorry for ranting, I know you weren't really bitching a la Digg, it's just that I spent a good year reading Digg articles on gaming and EVERY single article, whether it had to do with Sony or not, ended up with posts with +500 saying some dumbass remark about how the PS3 sucks, or is expensive, or some other such idiotic statement. It just really gets old seeing the general gaming public become such morons, but I guess that's the price we pay for making games mainstream, eh?

oh, and PS: since I bought the PS3 before Winter, thought I'd list what games I got before Winter; seriously, the ones that are good on the system are just insane.

Resistance

Heavenly Sword

Ratchet &amp; Clank

Uncharted

Warhawk

Virtua Fighter 5

Tekken 5

Eye of Judgment

MotorStorm

Yes, many indeed are the classes of self-sealing materials. Few are those that might work in a vacuum or be able to self-seal around a current of rushing air at enormous point pressure. Now I am sure there are a number of engineers that think O'Neills are feasible. Actually, so do I, eventually. But not with current technology. Most of the O'Neill supporters would probably say the same. It's not a case of ""Unobtanium"" like with a Ringworld, but it's certainly a ""Havenotyetobtanedium"" case.

I am aware that I am self-assembling nano. I am also aware I ""work"" only in a very limited temperature-pressure-atmosphere environment and I need a huge list of chemicals to keep me going, and that there's only a very limited amount that I can do with myself (on a purely physical basis). 

Notice you can not program me to dissolve into a puddle of goo and then re-assemble myself as an Orion spaceship ;)

The closest we will get to self-assembling nano is the self-assembling nano we already have - biology. 

As for nanotech being a purely industrial application that can be limited and controlled, I hope you're right. Some very smart engineers and scientists (not just Bill Joy) disagree with you. 

I'm not so worried but only because I don't think true sci-fi caliber nano is anywhere on the horizon.","1207054573"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;I have had this discussion with several people ( mainly with political and social liberals like me; friends from grad-school, family members etc etc)

I think this points to an important issue.  As far as I can tell most atheists who are hostile to religion on reddit (and of course, not all atheists are) tend to be socially liberal types who define religion as a conservative movement.  There certainly are religious movements that really are dangerous and are not compatible with a free, democratic, liberal society.  Fundamentalist crazies, dominionists, the Christian Identity movement, extreme Islamic sects, Scientology, etc. They are a problem because they actually work against human rights and want to abolish the values necessary to a free democratic society.  They look at things like pluralism, tolerance, freedom of speech, and even freedom of religion as incompatible with their religion, and as such they really are bad for a modern society, and their work to inject their extremist views into laws and education needs to be fought.

But there are also lots of religious people who look to their religion and derive values that are positive, and work towards social progress.  In many cases the argument that we are all equal before God has been used to effect positive social change.  The Abolitionist movement was largely a religious movement heavily driven by the churches of the day driven by such views.  John Brown was very much motivated by his religious views.  The Civil Rights movement in the 60s was lead by church leaders and succeeded because of the participation of churches across the country.  Gandhi was motivated by his religious views, and also derived some of his important ideas from the the Unitarian minister Thoreau’s ideas on civil disobedience, and through him they were are an inspiration to M.L.K.  Folks like Desmond Tutu should be remembered too.  

As a religious person whose religion is nothing like the parody of religion that is constantly attacked on reddit (as a Buddhist, I don't even believe in a God, so I am technically an atheist, though I reject the label since it carries so much baggage), and as a socially progressive liberal, I find the situation depressing.  The hostile atheists are actually alienating valuable allies.  Right now what the U.S. really needs is more liberal religious ideals permeating so that those who are religious can find people with shared positive liberal democratic ideals and reject the dangerous and destructive conservative elements in our society. Triumphalist atheism is not actually going to solve anything at all, it only make things worse by alienating liberal allies and giving powerful ammunition to the conservatives who love nothing better than preteding to be victims.  You'd be much better off making allies with the more useful elements of religion, since they are just as dead set against the fundamentalist crazies as you are.

P.S. I am not just ""spiritual,"" or, ""philosophical,"" I am religious.  I participate in religious rites in a religious organization, engage in regular religious practices, celebrate religious holidays, and so on.  The folks who tell me I am not religious are just defining away things that break their argument - it's not persuasive and if religious people did the same thing in an argument you'd reject it.

A lot goes in the form of military equipment, made of course by US military contractors.

NAFTA is a US centric proposal. It is definitely NOT charity - except to Wall Street and large international companies who now have more rights in foreign nations than they could shake a stick at. As an aside, it is not a ""free trade"" deal either; if it was, it will be about three, maybe four pages long.

Social Security is a small problem - relatively easy to fix, small adjustments in retirement age, increasing the max cap on contributions, indexing to prices not wages, stuff like that will solve it. The real problem is Medicare.

Interestingly enough, we ARE throwing money into ""third world hell holes"" but much more in the form of trade (or transfer payments) deficits than aid of any sort. In a sense, the US is now in hock to the ""third world hell holes,"" and we better hope that the fat leaders continue throwing money into US Treasuries (((especially you Saudi Arabia, we love u!)))

As for the letter; there's a lot of common misunderstandings about US economic, political and military power in the world. It is not too strange to see; the political class has been lying to the people for at least 30 years now trying to get them to believe that ""We're #1 (forever and ever, amen)"" a task made much easier by our out lasting the Soviets.

It is not strange that ordinary people believe it; it is that the elites themselves seem to believe it and act on those beliefs. THAT will come back to haunt the US...

"science","t5_mouw","The problem is that you're still trying to think of ""inside"" and ""outside"". The best analogy is to think of the 'cross' pattern of six squares that you can cut out and fold up to make a cube. A two-dimensional creature can understand the cross pattern, but thinks of one of the squares as 'stuck inside' four of the others.  It's hard to explain to him that once you 'fold up' the pattern into the third dimension, no square is really ""inside"" another -- the whole inside concept goes away, and they're all equal.

In the same way, the equivalent cross pattern  for a hypercube is built with cubes. Take one cube, and stick a cube to each of its 6 faces. Now take an eighth cube and stick it on the face of any cube facing out. You now have your 3D cross pattern. Once you 'fold up' this pattern into the 4th dimension, you have a hypercube, but there's no inside and outside any more.

You're really looking at a 3D 'perspective drawing' of a hypercube, in the same way you can have a 2D drawing on paper of a regular cube -- you can see what it's supposed to represent, but the actual pencil marks on paper are neither a square nor a cube, they just help you visualize.

Listen, I have a 360, but do you know what my system of choice is? The PC. I don't have a PS3 because I don't have the cash, not because I hate it. As for the games, there's simply a lot less that appeal to me. Currently on the system, there are literally 2 that I would buy (Resistance and Ratchet and Clank) that I can't get elsewhere. I guess that the fighting games are stronger on the PS3, but since Smash came out... who cares about the PS3 OR the 360?

Also, talking about Microsoft's strategy is a poor argument. Of the 3 major consoles, Sony has, inarguably, the worst warranty support. Your Wii doesn't play Smash? It'll be working in a week. Your 360 RRODed? Have a new one. Your PS3 is having MASSIVE issues with your shiny HD? That can't possibly happen; we can't help you.

If I had the cash, I'd buy one, for serious. There's a lot of cool shit coming out for it. But it doesn't change the fact that the PS3 was a poor competitor before this holiday season.

Your price argument is just wrong. The Xbox was 350 including hard drive at PS3 release. Xbox live is expensive, yes, but it is inarguably a stronger community with more robust features. It should be free, or it should NEVER go down, but it's a tradeoff right now. Some will choose PSN, some will choose Live.

Whatever; it's not a big deal. You're sick of people saying the PS3 sucks; I'm sick of people complaining about people saying it sucks. It did; it's better now; get over it.","1207055801"

For one thing, Ada has a type system which is pretty smart about numeric types. Being able to define that valid values for this type is integers from 3..320, and have checking for it at compile time - what other languages can give you that at all? Not many. Although modern type systems like the one Haskell and OCaml uses are better in many ways, they can't do this for you in the same way. (edit: Limited types - types statically protected from copying or mutation - is also something pretty important which no other languages offer that I know of)

Also, defense &amp; aerospace means low level, real time, mission critical. Very few languages are good for all those. The only ones that come close are C and C++, and they aren't safe (unless you use subsets that cripple them, and make them just as annoying and verbose as Ada).

Also, tool support. The RavenSPARK subset of Ada is, to my knowledge, the only programming environment in any language designed for static verification (proofs of correctness) of concurrent programs.

And I still wouldn't even if I didn't make it a practice to piss on it every chance I can.

&gt; I'm not so worried but only because I don't think true sci-fi caliber nano is anywhere on the horizon.

Then you'd better GET worried since synthetic biology and the advanced synthetic biological weapons that come with it, are VERY MUCH on the horizon. You really only have two choices here. You either get very, VERY worried, or you convince yourself that nanotech very much IS on the horizon. Anything else is ignorance or irrationality.","1207056194"

Seriously, this is the common tactic of every anti-sweat shop group - give numbers without context.  They have not shame.  Just because they are for a supposedly noble cause, they think they can just by trivial with the facts.  $59 is a little higher than the average monthly salary in the big city so how is this ridiculous?  Seriously, what do you think would happen if they artificially raised the wage significantly?  Less people becoming engineers because they're clamoring for these jobs.  Mom and pop shops can't compete for their labor so they go out of business, etc.

You people need to grow up and think beyond the bullshit propaganda.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","But the freedom to reply ""Go fuck yourself"" doesn't always exist, even in the US. You can't say those things on tv or radio without running risk of being censored or fined. You also run the risk that you saying those things will cause the racist to sue for slander, defamation or any other excuse to silence you. You can even create an atmosphere where certain things are technically allowed to be said, but where peer pressure is so strong that it is almost suicide.

Maybe some examples to illustrate my point. Say Obama would give a speech tomorrow where he calls Bush crazy because he frequently thinks he speaks to God. This falls clearly udner freedom of speech, yet public and media outcry would be so massive it would ruin him untill his death. End result: the same as if law had forbidden him to say it.
When Ron Paul said that the US caused 9/11 due to its foreign policy, this statement was not only correct, it was clearly protected by freedom of speech. Yet public outcry was massive, and such statements have since AFAIK never been repeated by any politician.

You see, there isn't a single nation that has true freedom of speech. Each has their own limitations and constraints. In the US, you can't publically do or say anything involving sexuality or ""defamation"" of either christianity or ""American superiority"". In Europe, you can't publically call one race superior to another, call for violence against certain religious or ethnic groups or deny crimes against humanity to further your own agenda. Guess which one I prefer?

We both have a bunch of situations where the population doesn't allow certain things to be said. Only difference is we put those things into law, clear for all to see, while the US hypocritically acts as if such things can actually be said.

It appears that your organization routinely ""attacks"" people on every level when they disagree with your organization's position.  Wonder why?  Why is it considered appropiate to take such actions?  You know, I don't see religions (exception - radical islam)doing that - do you?  It seems that only the fringe, cultish types of movements walk that road of blood.  Why does your organization choose this road as well?

Last time I looked, we live in a country with the freedom of expression.  I could personally care less of what you thought of my position on several different topics.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","First off, heh, I'm not a fanboy. I had a 360 before anything, actually. Had it for about 4 months, sold it after it RROD'd (before MS had admitted to lying about it being so widespread. Personally, I'd just like to be a PC gamer as well, but since I fried my processor last year, I've been more and more attracted to consoles. For me, the PS3 cost barely more than the 360 after all the peripherals and stuff, so it was well worth the time of saving a little bit of extra cash.

So I'm going to go ahead and laugh at the ""worst warranty support"". I have had problems with both consoles I owned (No idea why I haven't bought a Wii yet; I'm retarded, what with Smash, Metroid, Zelda, etc etc all released... need to get one pronto). 360 RROD'd? Was told to pay for a repair, and yes, even though it was before MS admitted fault, they were undoubtedly bullshitting me and I can't forgive them for such behavior. My PS3's BD drive went out while I was playing TF2 (I blame EA, somehow they caused it I'm sure). I called tech support, my product was out of warranty AND I didn't have an original receipt, because I bought it off eBay and I lost the receipt the seller gave me.

Guess what? No bitching, no griping, didn't have to threaten the service rep's life or his family's. Nope, not only did they say they'd send me the box to have my PS3 sent back to them, they told me that since my model was a 60gb that was currently out of production, that instead of a refurbished model that they normally give out when something breaks, they were going to give me a 60 gig straight from their factory, brand new, sealed.

And you know what? I got it a week and a half later. Not only that, but I got a game with it (Ratchet) ""For my trouble"". The console was definitely brand new, it was a 60 gig, and I could not have been happier.

Maybe they did turn me into a fanboy; that was only 2 months ago. My point being: with good business practices comes loyal customers. What's wrong with that? I love Nintendo to death because they've never harmed me when I had to deal with them, and I love Sony because they've never screwed me over. When my PS2's lens went out (a common problem IIRC), they fixed it free of charge. My 360? After 4 months of playing, those thieves wanted almost half the cost of the damn system for a repair, so excuse me if I'm a little pissy about the 360 and its parent company.

The price argument still stands btw, regardless of the fact that my price was off by 50 (although I said maybe $299?). Considering the 40gb model was going for $499, that's only $150 difference, which is almost what you would pay in Live fees.

It's late, and I guess I'm going to bed. I don't really feel like arguing over such arbitrary things anymore anyway, heh.","1207057784"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;(These government bodies already exist; I don't need to propose more of them. Government size and bureaucracy is a distinct argument from the idea of government regulation.)


No, those government bodies do not exist.  The MPAA is not a government body.  No government body exists that rates media as age appropriate.  The closest they come would be schools that decide what to give to kids for a certain grade, but they don't pass any sort of rating that prevents a child from picking up Naked Lunch from their local library.

&gt;There's a wide grey area for parents&amp; guardians to decide, but there are some things that children just should not see. I firmly believe that kids under 5, for instance, have a sacred right NOT to know most aspects of sexual intercourse.


That's nice that you think that, but generally when we pass a law that is going to determine whether someone is allowed to live freely or be locked in prison, we like to have more than just ""I firmly believe"".  You need to have some sort of material evidence that such things harm children before you can go around banning them.  Otherwise you're going to have endless bickering over things like whether a 12 year old should be allowed to read a book that has homosexual characters or things like that.

&gt;The Government already declares which books are age (or at least grade-level) appropriate. For instance, without the help of an older friend, brother or sister, no first grader is likely to get his hands on a 4th grade reader or math book. If a 1st grader did so, he or she might be daunted by the relatively high skill level, and may grow discouraged in his own work.

The government doesn't pass any laws about what books a 1st grader can and cannot read.  Pornography is in a special class, but when it comes to books and things, nothing prevents a child from picking up a copy of Tropic of Cancer or any other hardcore explicit book of any level of complexity.  That is handled by the parents exclusively.  And it works perfectly.  This is why I believe that it would work perfectly for every other form of media as well.  When a kid DOES get ahold of a book that is 'over their head' or whatever, no harm is done.  For all the fear mongering that people do about how dangerous ideas can be, they can't point to anyone harmed by reading the wrong book.  Maybe you could show people that were misled factually and things like that, but not the psychological scarring that people suggest.

&gt;R-rated films aren't declared so by the government, but the MPAA has plenty of authority to enforce them.

The MPAA has nearly no authority whatsoever to enforce ratings, what are you talking about?  They can't arrest someone for selling a kid an r-rated movie because it's not illegal.  They can't fine or arrest anyone for letting a kid watch an R rated movie in a theater because it's not illegal.  And it works just fine.  We do suffer with unnecessary censorship because of the age prohibition ratings that they give to movies (notice all the PG-13 movies that come out that are butchered and infantilized to reach that PG-13 demographic).  I would much prefer to see simple content labelling with no suggestions whatsoever as to what ages are appropriate.  

Sorry this next bit is out of order, but I forgot to hit it earlier...

&gt;I also believe that they have a right not to know what it feels like to have the shit scared out of them by any artificial means (haunted houses, scary movies, etc.) They are just learning how to live, and don't need to confront certain ideas yet.

What is wrong with being scared?  Scary movies are fantastic fun and kids love them just as much as older people do!  If the movie can't scare you, then you're missing out on the real experience of the movie.  The human brain has evolved to work most effectively when it deals with extremes and emotional 'crises' (in the psychological sense of the word).  There is mounting evidence that the preponderance of depression and bipolar disorders in western society is because of the LACK of extreme emotional experiences in the formative years.  It may well be that by trying to make a childs life calm and complacent, you're crippling them for life.  Wouldn't it be better to find out whether this is the case through study and then make decisions rather than simply going with your gut instinct?

Oh, and the Nazis that you alluded to earlier?  The reason there were no great voices of reason opposing them is because the government of the time was given the power you wish to give to the government - the power to decide what content is appropriate for children and adults in society.  The inevitably result of that is the restriction of any material that opposes the prevailing government sentiment at the time.  You get things like China and Tibet, Tiennamen Square, India with Gandhi, etc.  The road to hell is paved with good intentions and censorship has always led to severe abuse by the government.  That is yet another reason why we should not allowed the government rate content.","1207057992"

&gt;By the same token the violence by hezbollah towards israel while israel was occupying lebanon was also 100% justified.

How about the violence from Lebanon before and after Israel's occupation? That ok with you as well?

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Does it still matter if you split your dynamic and static content onto different servers?

Well, in that event you clearly don't have the issue of wasting interpreters on processes that aren't using them (though by doing that you might be wasting servers it takes a lot of static content to make even a small server notice).  There are other potential advantages, though.

For starters, if you do what we do and use FastCgiExternalServer, you can put things in between the backends and Apache; we used to run the pen load balancer, so if PHP died on one machine, it could fail over to other servers.  More recently we use a custom daemon (""pencil""), which buffers content to free up appservers from serving slow clients; it may have been a dynamic request, but you can waste a lot of time in PHP waiting for write() to finish, and buffering up all the content seperately and letting the appserver serve someone else can be a significant win.

You're also increasing isolation; a PHP exploit won't necessarily compromise the webserver and vice versa.  If you use external servers you can also completely seperate the services in chroots/zones/jails -- we do this, and have no interpreters at all, even /bin/sh, in our webserver jails.

It is extra management overhead, though, so YMMV as to whether it's worth bothering with or not.","1207058310"

No, they ignore it because that is not what the word means. It was created specifically to refer to anti-Jewish views and that is how it is used today. You and malcontent and others are trying to play a dishonest political game by attacking the word. That way you can hide the views.

Antisemitism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

""The term Semite refers broadly to speakers of a language group which includes both Arabs and Jews. However, the term antisemitism is specifically used in reference to attitudes held towards Jews. The word antisemitic (antisemitisch in German) was probably first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider in the phrase ""antisemitic prejudices"" (German: ""antisemitische Vorurteile"").[7] Steinschneider used this phrase to characterize Ernest Renan's ideas about how ""Semitic races"" were inferior to ""Aryan races."" These pseudo-scientific theories concerning race, civilization, and ""progress"" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as Prussian nationalistic historian Heinrich von Treitschke did much to promote this form of racism. In Treitschke's writings Semitic was synonymous with Jewish, in contrast to its usage by Renan and others.""

Let me ask you this: is it more important to have a super-attractive Zelda? Or get the feeling of seeing Epona for the first time just right. Does Link (who doesn't even speak in the video games, mind) need to be an excellent actor, or should they strive to capture the experience of travelling to the waters of Zora and the caves of the Gorons? Is it more important for Ganon's hair to look awesome, or for us to feel the same unknowing hatred for his character in the movie that we feel in the video game?

While I'm not saying that the acting should be sub-par, or the special effects are more important than Zelda's good looks, what I am saying is that comment embodies the problems with Hollywood trying to make a video game movie. They haven't played the games, they don't know what it is that draws us to them, makes them special, keeps us coming back for more. They spend 10 times the money on the leading actor as they do on the writing for the screenplay. They waste all their time and have 4 different people assigned to make sure Ganon's hair is perfect and Zelda's beasts are ""perky.""

It's very easy to use a prototype-based approach in Python; ISTR a library, but ""prototype Python"" unfortunately comes up with a lot of people talking about prototype pro_grams_ and not pro_gramming_. This [Lambda the Ultimate post](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1107) has somebody's code in the discussion which should provide a decent base.

Python and Javascript are actually quite similar, because of the way you can re-write the properties of any given object (with rare exceptions for the builtins). Python may have classes, but you don't actually have to use them. If you set up a prototype-based construction system for objects, _voila_, you have a prototyped Python, no other work needed and it'll all work fine.","1207060002"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; It covers only the very simple cases where macros are used so you can avoid writing 'lambda'. It doesn't cover any of the more interesting uses of macros.

Do you happen to have any examples? I'm only passingly familiar with Scheme and Lisp, so whilst I can see that macros are powerful, I lack the experience to imagine what uses they could be put to beyond laziness or as a bridge to languages like SQL or HTML.

However, I realize that it's often difficult to get an idea of how useful a language feature is until you've made extensive, practical use it. 

&gt;&gt; and in most cases does this in a safer and more concise fashion
&gt;
&gt; You'll have to explain that.

By ""safer"" I mean type safety. If I create a macro in Scheme, it could do anything. If I create a function in Haskell, it's constrained by its type signature.

&gt; I don't think this small constant overhead slows you down any while programming anyway.

I'm not sure. I've found that the benefits of  currying tend to add up. Here's a slightly longer function I created a while ago:

    listToForest :: Eq a =&gt; [[a]] -&gt; Forest a
    listToForest = map toTree . groupBy ((==) `on` head) . filter (/= [])
                   where toTree = Node . (head . head) &lt;*&gt; (listToForest . map tail)

The function turns a table of results, such as that which might come back from a database query, into a tree. e.g.

    [[A, B, C],
     [A, B, D],
     [A, E, F]]

Becomes:

        A 
       / \
      B   E
     / \   \
    C   D   F

If I were to program this in Scheme, I suspect it would turn out rather longer. On a small scale this may not matter, but on a larger scale I find it helps quite a lot. The larger a program is, the difficult it is to keep track of everything, and the more opportunity for bugs to creep in. Conciseness counts for a lot in those circumstances.","1207060268"
"reddit.com","t5_6","Ok, so you can pick and choose what part of $cientology you can follow? Wow. Is this a part of the ""NEW $cientology?""

Hey bubba. Look at the whole memo. Read the whole thing. Yes it does say what you referenced but it also says much more.

&gt;If you want to piss on and make life hard for Scientologists, then we are not required to be your friend, and we are not required to even be nice to you.

&gt;We won't tell our friends to be nice to you either.

&gt;If someone is mean and nasty to you, like you want to be to us, well, we won't object too loudly.

Persuction complex there? Looks that way. Naw, I have no reason to be ""mean and nasty"" to $cientologists. You have the freedom of speach, the exercise of religion (though your organization is not a religion - but that is a later point)and the right of the people peaceably to assemble. Your freedom ends however where mine begins. When you attack me for my position on your organization's methods attacking others, then I truly wonder what type of organization you belong.

It's not that you don't afford me rights to your ""benefits and services"" but that you feel that the organization can freely attack with impunity any person that disagrees.
Drive $cientology underground? Never! Expose its actions to the light of day - you betcha!
I love how you try to come off as the persecuted type. You don't do it well. I think if you decided to use your head for something other than a hat rack, sat down and thought through what I am saying you would quickly discover that I am not against $cientology (though I believe the premise of your beliefs are flawed) but its actions against people.

For people that believe in helping others, the organization to which you belong excels at destroying others lives. Why is this? Most importantly - what are you doing personally to change this organizational belief?

I know you would like to draw me down another line of reasoning but you will find that until the organization of $cientology changes, I will question its ""inherent right"" (by memo) to harm people.
Wish to respond? (on topic thank you)

Here's a very short one. There's no way to write something like PUSH! without macros:

    (define-syntax push!
      (syntax-rules ()
        ((_ b v) (set! b (cons v b)))))

    (define x '())
    (push! x 10)
    (push! x 20)
    (push! x 30)
    (display x)  ; (30 20 10)

Of course, that's just a trivial example of why macros are useful *for Scheme*. For examples that don't involve SET! that would pertain to Haskell, you'll have to google around a bit. I'm late for class already...

&gt; By ""safer"" I mean type safety. If I create a macro in Scheme, it could do anything. If I create a function in Haskell, it's constrained by its type signature.

Scheme's syntax-rules macros are very easy to read. They double as specifications, so it's not really fair to say they can ""do anything"". In fact, syntax-rules *can't* perform arbitrary transformations.

&gt; I'm not sure. I've found that the benefits of currying tend to add up.

Don't get me wrong: If I magically had my way, Scheme would have partial application instead of N-ary functions.","1207060932"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I don't know why graduation rate necessarily means ""smarter."" Really seems to be more indicative of an issue of class and socio-economic status.

I went to a variety of suburban high schools on the East Coast and graduated from an Indianapolis Public high school. The big cultural differences I found were the following:

1. Suburban kids eat better. So they perform better in school because they have better nutrition and aren't hungry. People in Indiana are notorious for being fat. It's because they eat crap. Wonder why we don't have a Whole Foods/Sunflower Market/etc downtown yet? 'Cause apparently there isn't a market for the 20-30,000 folks who live downtown. Trader Joes, Wild Oats, and the like are falling all over themselves to build Northside/Northern suburbs.
Meanwhile, I'm shopping at Bud's or Double 8 and hoping that cheese I just bought isn't 80% silicone. The lady behind me is stretching her food stamps as far as she can and buying peanut butter, generic poptarts, and hotdogs.

2. Suburban kids are descended, generally, of  white people who fled to avoid ""crime,"" or a decaying innercity, or a combination of both. 
So what a kid is told implicitly, if not explicitly, is how education will keep them from being poor and will give them more choices in life, etc, etc, etc. It's really about fear, and dare I say, snobbery.One of my best friends I graduated from the previously mentioned inner-city school is a lawyer in CA. She suffered from rickets as a kid. Her mother never graduated from HS and her father was a machinist. At some point in her schooling somebody pointed out that if she worked hard at school, she wouldn't have to live like she was living as a kid. Like I said, she's a lawyer, so she's as tenacious as a mongoose. No matter what got in her way, she overcame. Her more laid-back brother, on the other hand, was tired of having his ass kicked at school all the time and administrators treating him like white trash and not doing anything to intervene. So he dropped out. On the upside, he's now an electrician and buying a house for himself before most kids even graduate college. It seems finding what you are good at doing is more important than graduating, to be honest.

3. Indiana has some really lax standards on graduation requirements compared to the other schools I came from. Attendance wasn't enforced as stringently because it was such a common overwhelming percentage of students not showing up everyday, I'm sure they could  not easily keep up. The suburban kids looked like timid sheep in comparison to the city kids I went to school with. (And these were just the ""geeks"" that are all now doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc). The city kids were constantly pushing the envelope and manipulating the system whenever they could. 
What I wonder is, if school were made to be non-compulsory and something that you had to work at to join, an accomplishment of sorts, wouldn't it be more attractive? 

What if they made guidance counselors that actually provided guidance?
As it stands, urban schools feel like prisons where the population is being babysat. These kids could be out hustling money for their poor families (or already are and falling asleep in class) rather than fulfilling a dream that will probably end up in tons of student loans and some soul-sucking corporate whoredom.","1207061030"

they would, however, prevent the child from _finding_ naked lunch or some other books in the school library.  My Jr. High schools, for instance, didn't carry Stephen King books.


&gt;but generally when we pass a law that is going to determine whether someone is allowed to live freely or be locked in prison, we like to have more than just ""I firmly believe"".

""I firmly believe and vote accordingly.""  How does that sound?

&gt;when it comes to books and things, nothing prevents a child from picking up a copy of Tropic of Cancer or any other hardcore explicit book of any level of complexity.  That is handled by the parents exclusively.

Availability has a big impact on young children.

And parents aren't the only people who make books available / unavailable to children.  Librarians, and shopkeepers also have a big impact.

&gt;And it works perfectly. 

Not in evidence.

&gt;This is why I believe that it would work perfectly for every other form of media as well. 

Assumption based on facts not in evidence.

However, at least you concede that parents should have some authority in this area.  Should they be advised as to how to use this authority?  Should they have the ability to know whether a book has strong sexual content, or will teach other harmful things to children.

Perhaps a child picks up a book called ""frying liver"" and convinces the parent, based on the title alone, that it is a cookbook when in fact it is a suicide manual?

I'll note here the lack of books describing bomb-making for children in the present day.  They did exist in the 1800's.  If you want to search for them, go ahead.


And about the scared comment: I was discussing kids under 5, an age when they don't understand the difference between truth and make-believe.

&gt;There is mounting evidence that the preponderance of depression and bipolar disorders in western society is because of the LACK of extreme emotional experiences in the formative years. It may well be that by trying to make a childs life calm and complacent, you're crippling them for life. Wouldn't it be better to find out whether this is the case through study and then make decisions rather than simply going with your gut instinct?

Cite sources, please.  In the meantime, please read up on the long-term effects of [psychological child abuse](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/pediatrics;109/4/e68.pdf) from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

While she does have that right (as Obama said in PA just yesterday), realistically in order for the democrats to take back the White House in November, the party needs to begin to come together again and stop with the accusations and negative campaigning.  To quote Senator Clinton from this article, ""My take on it is a lot of Senator Obama's supporters want to end this race because they don't want people to keep voting;"" it doesn't seem that there is any healing going on.  Instead, she's choosing to attack the very people she would hope to be elected by if she did win the nomination.  Insulting the electorate isn't good politics, it's down right stupid.  I support whichever candidate has the best chance to win the election.  Senator Clinton has virtually no chance of securing the nomination, nor does she have the ability to win a national election (especially by insulting half of her base).  The nominating process in nature will always create primaries where the votes don't matter.  Currently John McCain has clinched his parties nomination, yet republican primaries are still held in the remaining states.  The same would be true for the democrats, and considering the percentage of the population that actually participate in primary elections, I doubt that many voters would ever feel disenfranchised or robbed of their democratic rights.

We live in a world where you can't even get people to understand that caging an animal for amusement (zoos) is wrong, for the animal and the human. No, most people are just too selfish and no one wants their amusement or comfort disrupted.  I was fascinated by animals just as all children were but at some point I saw how sad those animals were, being caged up.  Maybe it's about myself - isn't that what empathy is anyway? Tell people this and ridicule will follow - no one wants to feel empathy for an animal and spoil all their ""fun"".

Well, for me it made my life a lot better.  Of course, I was in the other direction so a change did me a lot of good.  A lot about living a good, balanced life is just that, balance.

Not that Comcast is that much better, but they did at least (seriously, within a month of becoming the cable operator) add a pile of channels that AT&amp;T's PR rep continue to always say ""There is no demand for that channel in San Francisco.""

1) Closing up shop permanently or moving elsewhere
2) Greater investment in capital to replace human labor.  It's the reason why you have automated cashiers at Walmart.

Businesses aren't in the position to be charitable.  People who work their ass off deserve their rewards.  How would you feel about limiting the rewards for professional athletes?  Look at the Fortune 500 list 10 years ago and current ones.  Look at how many businesses have fallen off the list or have gone bankrupt.  Skimming their rightful profits would only lessen the performance.  You think Lebron James would play as well as he does if the cap was $10 million/year?  Why should they risk their bodies and spend most of the year traveling around playing games if the financial incentives weren't there?

Again, you people are failing to understand the importance of recognizing the role of incentives and failing to understand how much benefit you and everyone else derives from the system.

As for the Illuminati, they were formed by the merging of I think two main Masonic and/or Jesuit Orders in Europe on May 1st 1776, one of them being the Bavarian Order.  They were disbanded in Europe 1784 by the ruler of Bavaria, Karl Theodor.  Much documentation can be seen in Bavaria as well as the British Museum/Library on this and also the letters sent by the Bavarian Government to Paris warning of the illegal activities.  This is why they became famous, - they weren't exactly a secret society.  Fame isn't good for the organizers of secret societies.

Well I would...but people who actually have merit for doing such research, putting it all together and collaborating with a man who has timelined events (all from mainstream sources going back to the 80's) that do not corroborate with the official story have already done so.

Kinda hard to discount these women who lost their husbands and have legitimate questions surrounding 9/11.  Maybe that's why they only made it mainstream once and were quickly forgotten. 

Oh, yeah, no conspiracy theories about thermite or planes flying into the Pentagon - just wives who want answers to their poignant questions.

Timeline: http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/project.jsp?project=911_project

edit:  I've read extensively about 9/11 from both sides of the fence.  After swimming through the mind numbing amount of 'evidence' I asked myself who has benefited the most from this event?  I could see a government letting something like this happen to impose more control.  I've never understood why that's so hard to believe.  

It's happened in the past.

The no, not *our* government mentality has always struck me as odd and a bit daft to be quite honest.

I didnt think it was too much of an issue, and the reps at Bellsouth told me to just send it in when I get it. See, I had always paid every bill on time, full amounts and never caused any trouble, and I explained my situation about not being able to pay until the end of the month and they were ok with it. 

Then AT&amp;T bought Bellsouth, and they merged. I came home from work one day and my net wasnt working. So I called up the bellsouth rep people and immediately got pushed to billing without even giving me a notice. If I wanted my net back, then I owed them $55.(apparently it doubled +5 in the couple weeks that At&amp;t bought them.) The CR person on the other side of the phone was rude and treated me like a delinquent account and threatened collections if it wasnt paid in five days. I explained the situation to them and they were too inept at financing and math to understand that I wouldnt have the money to pay for it free until the end of the month. Talked to the supervisor to the same results. 

I paid for it at the end of the month (which was $70 at that point) and I closed my account (which.. cost me money for some reason). I will never do business with AT&amp;T again.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Congress appropriates funding for the Executive Branch. The Executive Branch can decide to not spend the money appropriated. So the Executive Branch can't unilaterally increase funding, but they can cut spending by refusing to spend the money that Congress appropriated. The Executive Branch can also refuse to request additional funding for cost increases. Congress then has a much harder time appropriating monies which were not requested and usually don’t. The Bush Administration has been cutting funding this way to many key bureaus and projects during the last two terms to limit their ability to deliver services to the people and oversight of Executive function. The government created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to insulate PBS and public radio from political influence, but Bush has loaded the CPB with political cronies over the years to by pass that. At least one Bush appointed CPB chief had to step down when his politicization of PBS became too overt and overreaching.

"business","t5_2qgzg","I have a great gas tax idea: tax gas on a sliding scale of 1 percentage point per gallon purchased. At $3/gallon, the taxes on a purchase would be:

1 gal. = $0.03 tax

2 gal. = $0.12 tax

5 gal. = $0.75 tax

10 gal. = $3.00 tax

20 gal. = $12.00 tax

Two purchases of 10 gallons would cost $6 in tax, while one 20 gallon purchase would cost $12 in tax, thus favoring smaller, more efficient cars. Gas guzzlers would (if they could figure out the math) be stuck filling up half way all the time or looking silly doing multiple purchases to save a buck or two. And that would be additional incentive to not buy and drive big gas guzzlers.","1207062570"

1.) Delivery systems that don't fry, freeze or stun the bugs into a weakened state.

2.) Testing. Kind of hard to find willing subjects, and unwilling ones tend to get noticed (even in places like North Korea, word would get out)

3.) The nature of evolution itself. A microbe that rapidly kills its host is a failure in evolutionary terms. Overcoming millions of years of programming to create an efficient killer is quite tough.

4.) Finding the right balance between killing too fast a la Ebloa (no time to spread) and not killing fast enough (giving the body's immune system time to respond).

Those of us who invest &amp; save wisely will not be asked, but will instead be *ORDERED* to spend our hard-earned money to bail out banks and investment firms that are too stupid to fail. Because government was too busy with it's head up it's ass invading and destroying a non-threat to deal with the *REAL* problems in the financial industry. 


Tell me hillary, where were you while all these debacles were occurring?  Were you putting up any kind of fight whatsoever? Were you telling the president 'no, not in my name!'; rallying your party; rallying Americans as a whole, to the various causes, and leading the way?  Or were you on your back, like so many others letting the president steam-roll you cause it was for national security?  What benefit have the people of America gained from your so-called experience? 


It seems to me, that experience should be the watchword in this election. that 'experience' means you are part of the system, of the system, a cog in the system. the *SYSTEM* that has caused so much ill in so many places, the *SYSTEM* that is quickly and expeditiously decimating this country.  If this is the path that ""experience"" walks, then perhaps we need to walk a new path. A path of hope, a path of  new perceptions, new ideas, new glory.

When I was young, around this age, I secretly longed to be left behind.

My parents were alcoholics and self-obsesses like much of the baby boomer parents of the time and they were very absentee when it came to parenting.  I would always try to get left behind when we all went somewhere because it felt like if I did then they would finally pay attention to me.

This is what children in fucked up familial situations do sometimes...thus the whole fascination with the ""Home Alone"" movies.

Yes, a is obviously a nan. The point is that, because of floating-point semantics, == does not denote an equivalence relation even in languages where the operator is transitive.

This has some surprising consequences; for example, if nan is used as a key to a hash table, a lookup only works if the hash table implementation checks and accepts pointer identity before attempting equality in the == sense.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; there exist several (modern) ""hate-speech"" laws acrosss Europe (and America) originally designed to eliminate any criticism of Judaism and Israel.

That's a very fair point and laws such as that in Austria banning Holocaust denial are ludicrous and almost as embarrassing as the very people who deny the reality of the wholesale murder of Jews during World War Two.

Some of these laws also have the very unfortunate effect of making ""The West"" appear to be hypocritical with regard to its opposition of this latest declaration by the UN's HRC.

However, by no means all (or even most?) ""anti-hate"" laws are aimed at defending religion and other superstitious beliefs. Many have been formulated in accordance with the very humanistic and secular concern to help maintain harmonious relations between cultural groups within multi-cultural societies.

Most importantly, though, we disagree about how the problem should be handled. My view is that those who were irresponsible—lenders, investors, buyers—should be punished through the wallet. That is, they shouldn't be bailed out in any way, shape, or form. The market will take care of the punishment; the government doesn't need to interfere, and they'll just make it worse if they do.

Where the market might fail is in punishing bond rating agencies, which were also instrumental in this fiasco. I don't have an answer to that, but civil lawsuits (on behalf of the investors) may end up being part of the picture.","1207064747"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Heh... so based on the equation they use in their ""research""  (see the ""How come I only get ten?"" section), if the average life expectancy is 75, then their ""Probability that user believes the time stamp"" to ""total emails sent"", looks something like this:

* 10%   : approx 7512 emails
* 25%   : approx 3005 emails
* 50%   : approx 1502 emails
* 75%   : approx 1001 emails
* 100%  : approx 751 emails

Now here's the most interesting part of this all.  Let's rearrange their equation so that average life expectancy is on the right hand side:

((N * P) - sqrt(phi)) / A = L

* N = Total emails sent
* P = Probability that user believes the time * stamp
* phi = The Golden Ratio
* L = Average life expectancy
* A = Number of altered timestamp emails

So if you believe that your timestamp is correct 100% of the time, send (recieve?) 1000 emails per year, and alter only 1 of their timestamps, you can live to be... 998.73 years old??

&gt; Each element requires a value structure (zval) which takes 16 bytes. Also requires a hash bucket - which takes 36 bytes. That gives 52 bytes per value. Memory allocation headers take another 8 bytes*2 - which gives 68 bytes.

&gt; Since PHP is a high level language, this incurs some penalties on handling values - i.e., we can't just store an integer, we have to store information about it's type, reference counts, etc. Same with arrays - we can't just put it as a block of memory, we have to enable it to work with all kinds of array functions, etc. - all of which takes its toll.

Comcast has said it can pack three high-definition signals into space typically used for two—without viewers noticing a drop in quality. But at least one viewer has.

A member of AVS Forum, a community site for audio/video enthusiasts, has posted the results of his comparison of the compression rates for 10 HD channels offered by Comcast and Verizon Communications’ FiOS TV in Northern Virginia.

The user, “bfdtv,” said his test showed Comcast is delivering certain MPEG-2 HD channels at bit rates as much as 28% lower than Verizon, resulting in lower-quality pictures.

For example, an A&amp;E HD broadcast of an episode of The Sopranos had an average bit rate of 18.66 Megabits per second on FiOS TV, whereas Comcast’s version was 22.4% lower—at 14.48 Mbps. Verizon, like most cable companies, distributes linear TV programming in MPEG-2 format.","1207065285"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; There's no way to write something like PUSH! without macros

Well, if you have a language that has access to its own interpreter stack, such as Python, you can create something similar:

    def push(b, v):
        inspect.stack()[1][0].f_locals[b].insert(0, v)

    x = []
    push(""x"", 10)
    push(""x"", 20)
    push(""x"", 30)
    print x       # [30, 20, 10]

However, I'll grant that this is hardly as elegant as the Scheme version, and isn't really recommended Python code. Accessing frames currently in use by the interpreter can lead to problems if you're not careful, whilst the Scheme macro is perfectly safe.

In Haskell you don't have a namespace of mutable variables, so there isn't really any equivalent to _push!_. You could _make_ a mutable namespace with a Map and a State monad, but that's probably cheating, and not really very useful :)

&gt; Scheme's syntax-rules macros are very easy to read. They double as specifications, so it's not really fair to say they can ""do anything"". In fact, syntax-rules _can't_ perform arbitrary transformations.

You are speaking of 17x overhead, I'm shouting bullshit.

&gt; linked list is completely different data structure.

When PHP programmers tell you they are using what is called an ""array"" i PHP-speak - they are actually using what we would call an ""ordered map of type any"" in C-speak.

Look up ""array"" in the dictionary or Wikipedia - all the word means is: [""a group of elements that are accessed by indexing""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array). The use of static types is not a part of the definition.

And where in the STL do we find std::map_any?!?

&gt; PHP could have all this options too, but it gives only one -- and so there is huge overhead for almost anything.

Then please tell me, how many of these STL/boost data structures will automatically convert their integers to doubles if they overflow?

So of course PHP has a byte overhead - but it's not 17x - and then you have to consider which is cheapest: a couple of hours of programmer time or buying that extra memory DIMM for your server.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;We're in trouble as a world when vaginas become more sacred than lives. 

You say you're not trying to be snide, but that remark seems less than accurate.

We aren't comparing vaginas to lives.  We are comparing what rape would do to a woman's mind and her life to a criminal's life.

In my mind, the criminal's life is worth less than the innocent victim's life.

What surprises me about this whole discussion is how many people seem willing to(claim that they would) let the law plod along, perhaps even ineffectively, even if it were their loved-one that was affected.

My wife and I were discussing what we would do if someone were to do something like this to our young son - and how un-natural it must be and how humiliating it must be for parents of a young child who is abused by a stranger to sit in a court room and see the person who did this to their child sitting across the room unharmed and wait - and hope - for the law to do the right thing.  And how often the law does not.

I would think the same emotions would apply here.  A man has been dating a girl for 3 years.  Some other man - already on probation for two other sexual assaults - rapes his long-time girlfriend and it is looking like he may get away with this attack as well.  This man has never seriously broken the law before according to his non-existent criminal record.

Yet reddit seems to think that removing him from society for 16 years because he took this predator out of society is the right thing to do.

Words fail me.

I get that some people here are very concerned that vigilante justice is wrong and could lead to terrible things.  But in THIS CASE it did not.  The right guy was eliminated.  He was a BAD guy.  He was harming society and the law wasn't stopping him.

What I get from this is that reddit as a whole seems to have a majority of people that believe the good of the whole is more important than the good of the individual.

I do not believe that.  I believe that fiercely protecting the individual is what is best for the whole of society.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;they would, however, prevent the child from finding naked lunch or some other books in the school library. My Jr. High schools, for instance, didn't carry Stephen King books.

That is a far cry from it being illegal.  Schools are typically overly paranoid and scared of uppity parents that tend to have knee-jerk reactions to stuff like what books their precious snowflakes are able to get in the school library.  In many schools, they've removed Harry Potter books because there are a large quantity of imbecile parents in the area who are afraid it will seduce children into witchcraft.

&gt;""I firmly believe and vote accordingly."" How does that sound?

That doesn't help your argument and only suggests that you vote in ignorance and without evidence.  You shouldn't be so careless.  Laws are a matter of freedom or imprisonment.

&gt;Not in evidence.

Wrong.  It is very abundant in evidence.  Case in point:  Our society has not crumbled as thousands of years have passed with books you would consider objectionable being in reasonably high availability to children and certainly no government regulation surrounding them.

&gt;Assumption based on facts not in evidence.

As I just said, there is more than enough evidence that media availability is harmless and, in truth, there is a great deal of evidence that it is beneficial.  If you want to change how society has treated books for the past several centuries, you're going to need to be the one presenting evidence that there is reason to do so.

&gt;However, at least you concede that parents should have some authority in this area. Should they be advised as to how to use this authority? Should they have the ability to know whether a book has strong sexual content, or will teach other harmful things to children.

Yes, parents should be advised in the form of parenting books and suggestions.  No, they should not be punished by law if they allow their kids to read something deemed to be too 'advanced' for their childs age.  Why not?  Because, as I keep stating, it's harmless.  Your belief that strong sexual content is ""harmful"" is ridiculous and unfounded.

&gt;Perhaps a child picks up a book called ""frying liver"" and convinces the parent, based on the title alone, that it is a cookbook when in fact it is a suicide manual?

This has been possible for thousands of years.  Very obviously, it is not something worth worrying about.

&gt;I'll note here the lack of books describing bomb-making for children in the present day. They did exist in the 1800's. If you want to search for them, go ahead.

I believe you.  Now, where is your evidence that the availability of those books to children was a harmful thing?  No, I am not going to simply assume or use 'common sense'.  This is a serious matter when you want to immerse children in ignorance and hold them down in it.

&gt;And about the scared comment: I was discussing kids under 5, an age when they don't understand the difference between truth and make-believe.

There is exactly 1 way for children to learn the difference between truth and make-believe: experience.

&gt;Cite sources, please. In the meantime, please read up on the long-term effects of psychological child abuse from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Ahh, I see the problem.  You, yourself, can't tell the difference between fiction and reality.  You think that seeing pictures or reading a book about sex is the same thing as actually being molested.  I assure you, that is not the case.  When reading a book, watching TV, etc even young children experience a great deal of psychological 'distance' and do not process the information in the same was as them being molested and actually abused.  The difference is so titanic that it is, literally, the difference between fiction and reality.  It takes a bit of mental effort to confuse the two for most adults, but it's becoming a more and more common problem.  Look at all the adults that see their kids playing a violent videogame and then go on to claim that their children spent the afternoon killing hookers and their fear that their children will actually feel the same psychological effects as a person who, in real life, kills hookers.  On the surface, it is quite ludicrous, but it's really quite serious.  It's the motivation behind a great deal of the ridiculous censorship movements of the day.","1207065812"

In this case, there are ~10 lines of code. In these 10 lines, a process is spawned which can respond to two distinct messages, 'hello' and 'goodbye'. These are not unlike method calls on the process, if we consider the process to be akin to an object.

When responding to the hello message, the process prints 'hello world' and then tail-recurses to await the next message. While engaged in the receive block, the process queues further requests in its mailbox (as per the Actor model) and automatically processes those messages (that match) when the call recurses. When responding to 'goodbye', the process dies and memory is automatically reclaimed. 

I would say that's not bad for 10 lines of code.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I understand that you're upset.  I was too.  I voted for Hillary in CA, but, as time has gone on, I am horrified at her VERY REPUBLICAN TORCH THE LANDSCAPE tactics.  I have been reading articles by what were once close friends and allies to Hillary and the Clintons, and they are just as horrified and increasingly being alienated by her maniacal drive to keep going despite CLEAR indications that her momentum has faded, despite the fact that it is clear that this could ruin the Dems chance in November, she seems unable to let it go.  That infuriates me.  

Look, it was a long road to this opinion. It started with wondering WHY WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER TAX RETURNS.  And then the fishy donating 5 million to her own campaign and obscuring where it came from.  Then the gross exaggerations of her experience or acting as if, AS FIRST LADY, she was responsible for policy-making.  Then the attacks on Obama. This smells like Dick Cheney/Karl Rove to me.  I don't want another snaky, ""I will crush all who get in my way"" politician running my country. She is not Bill. She's a thwarted woman.  She was thwarted from her dreams for 30 years by being the WIFE of a powerful politician who cheated on her.  

I believe Hillary is brilliant.  I believe, when she graduated from Wellesley, she was an idealist, a visionary, a powerful and caring feminist who had a good heart and great dreams.  Many said, at that time, that they believed Hillary would be the first woman president.  She was that powerful and dynamic.  She was Barack Obama.  But, then she married a brilliant, charismatic leader and became a political wife.  I think she looks back on what she gave up, and where she was supposed to be, and is angry and tired of being thwarted in her efforts to BE THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT.  It's her last dream, her last chance to live up to the promise she had at Wellesley.  But she lost all the idealism, and looks at Obama and resents his ""inexperience"" because he hasn't been crushed by 30 years of being in the dirt of politics.

I feel sad for that.  I actually think, if she had conceded earlier and not been so vengeful, that her time to be president would come.  It just wasn't going to be now.  Maybe she doesn't want to wait.  But, she could have left gracefully, not in huge debt, and  could have salvaged a second chance at the presidency. That's not possible now.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The simple facts really. Ones that Americans aren't encouraged to know about. This is from memory, the timelines may not be 100% accurate. 

After a prolonged period of threats from the US, a country Castro wanted to remain friendly with, he was forced to turn to the Soviets in the reality of the Cold War. Every one picked sides and the US team made their stance clear WRT Cuba. 

The Soviets saw this as way to level the playing field and remove the advantage that the US missiles in Turkey were and decided to use Cuba as a base to counter the Turkey threat. 

While the sites were under construction, routine aerial surveillance found them. The US escalated and flew more flights to confirm. They then went public and told the Russians this was unacceptable and enacted a blockade of Cuba, threatening military action against any Russian ships supplying weapons. 

The Russian ships steamed ahead and the world prepared to kiss it's ass goodbye. The US increased the frequency of the flights and allowed pilots to ""buzz"" the Cuban position in simulated bombing runs. We are lucky that some stupid, gun-ho Cuban didn't start the war there and then, but the flights passed off largely without incident. 

At the last minute, the Russian ships turned back, avoiding the inevitable conflict. Peace was then negotiated by Kennedy and his diplomats. The USSR won the concession that the US would withdraw from Turkey while the Russians did the same in Cuba. The deal also made it clear that the US population were not to be told about the missiles in Turkey. This then enabled them to play it off as a strategic win, something the vast majority of Americans still believe to this day.

Note that while the negotiations were occurring, Kennedy's advisers pushed for a first-strike, with the opinion that they should do it why they still can. It was Kennedy's level head that held them back. I don't know much about the guy, but I know that he literally saved the planet. If Bush has been in charge we would be living underground now.

&gt; At the heart of this crisis is an apparent inability or unwillingness to prosecute rapists in the ranks. According to DOD statistics, only 181 out of 2,212 subjects investigated for sexual assault in 2007, including 1,259 reports of rape, were referred to courts-martial, the equivalent of a criminal prosecution in the military.
&gt;
&gt; This is in stark contrast to the civilian trend of prosecuting sexual assault. In California, for example, 44% of reported rapes result in arrests, and 64% of those who are arrested are prosecuted, according to the California Department of Justice. 

Her position seems to be: concerned about rape everywhere, but trying to highlight the fact that in the military, it is not treated as seriously as in civilian life, and rapists are not prosecuted or punished at nearly the same rates.

And what is her suggestion to deal with the problem?  Nothing about ""anti-war"", but rather, the obvious: more enforcement.

&gt; The DOD must close this gap and remove the obstacles to effective investigation and prosecution. Failure to do so produces two harmful consequences: It deters victims from reporting, and it fails to deter offenders. The absence of rigorous prosecution perpetuates a culture tolerant of sexual assault -- an attitude that says ""boys will be boys.""","1207066345"

It still doesn't change the fact that arabs are semites, and thus to be anti-semitic is to be prejudice against that entire ethnic group. If you look at the actual history (which you won't, you'll just keep repeating this same baseless point over and over) you'll notice that historically it has been a prejudice leveled against arabs as well.

but this is the last comment I make on the subject, you know you're full of it, and if you haven't noticed there's nothing in either of our posts on the subject that are conditional or contain the phrase ""I think"" or anything, so the fact that you're warping your entire view of history to conform to how your opinion now should be a cause for alarm for you, eventually that always comes back to bite your a**.","1207067011"

Now IF Bush had acted then and frozen ENRON, all the money and all the assets in those Enron accounts wouldn't have evaporated . . . and many of the millions of people that had invested in ENRON wouldn't have lost billions.

THIS ADMINISTRATION, in particular, has made it dead clear to the entire nation on more than one occasion that the market is a ""leech festival"".  They suck the money from people (with 401Ks and mortgage backed securities) and that money goes ""elsewhere"".

Any soldier who values his life over that of innocent civilians is nothing more than a useless piece of garbage, unworthy of wearing his countries uniform. Certain branches of government such as the police, firemen and (a defensive) military enjoy a certain respect and benefits because it is implied these people will lay down their lives in protection of others. It is something anyone who joins these organizations should be crystal clear about: if they ever need to choose between their own life and that of an innocent civilian, society expects them to die, and do it gladly. 

The US military has two options regarding Iraqi civilians. Either they are nothing but brutal invaders occupying a sovereign nation, or they are there for the benefit of the Iraqi people. In the first case, please refer to this for further course of action: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials 
In the second case they should treat Iraqi civilians as if they were US citizens, in which case soldiers should rather let themselves and their buddies be killed than risk harming civilians. 

And besides, every time they shoot a civilian to save their own lives, they lengthen the conflict and doom a dozen of their buddies to die at the hand of retaliation attacks. So even if we cast aside all morality, valuing their lives as worth less than that of civilians is still the preferable outcome. ","1207067372"

"science","t5_mouw","But seriously, there are experiments that have shown that wine ""experts"" are full of bullshit.

[scienceblogs.com Lehrer 2007:](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2007/11/the_subjectivity_of_wine.php?source=rss_feed)
&gt; In 2001, Frederic Brochet, of the University of Bordeaux, conducted two separate and very mischievous experiments. In the first test, Brochet invited 57 wine experts and asked them to give their impressions of what looked like two glasses of red and white wine. The wines were actually the same white wine, one of which had been tinted red with food coloring. But that didn't stop the experts from describing the ""red"" wine in language typically used to describe red wines. One expert praised its ""jamminess,"" while another enjoyed its ""crushed red fruit."" Not a single one noticed it was actually a white wine.

&gt; The second test Brochet conducted was even more damning. He took a middling Bordeaux and served it in two different bottles. One bottle was a fancy grand-cru. The other bottle was an ordinary vin du table. Despite the fact that they were actually being served the exact same wine, the experts gave the differently labeled bottles nearly opposite ratings. The grand cru was ""agreeable, woody, complex, balanced and rounded,"" while the vin du table was ""weak, short, light, flat and faulty"". Forty experts said the wine with the fancy label was worth drinking, while only 12 said the cheap wine was.

Also, [Feb 24 2008, Lehrer reports results of brain-scan wine-tasting](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/02/24/grape_expectations/)
&gt; SCIENTISTS AT CALTECH and Stanford recently published the results of a peculiar wine tasting. They provided people with cabernet sauvignons at various price points, with bottles ranging from $5 to $90. Although the tasters were told that all the wines were different, the scientists were in fact presenting the same wines at different prices.

&gt; When subjects were told they were getting a more expensive wine, they observed more activity in a part of the brain known to be involved in our experience of pleasure.

&gt; What they saw was the power of expectations. People expect expensive wines to taste better, and then their brains literally make it so. Wine lovers shouldn't feel singled out: Antonio Rangel, the Caltech neuroeconomist who led the study, insists that he could have used a variety of items to get similar results, from bottled water to modern art.","1207067443"

""Building a Toyota Prius causes more environmental damage than a Hummer that is on the road for three times longer than a Prius. As already noted, the Prius is partly driven by a battery which contains nickel. The nickel is mined and smelted at a plant in Sudbury, Ontario. This plant has caused so much environmental damage to the surrounding environment that NASA has used the ‘dead zone’ around the plant to test moon rovers. The area around the plant is devoid of any life for miles.""

If Obama supporters are calling on Hillary to pull out of the race, they **are** disenfranchising the voters of Montana, Transylvania and North Carolina.  Its for a fucking good reason, but still.  Because you're unlikely to have a closer primary than this one (yes, I know, I know -- its not really that close) any time in the near future.  And the few states that did try to jockey their voters into a better position to have an impact got seriously smacked down. 

None of this is Obama's fault.  It all points to a need to have a better primary process.  As does the superdelegate bullshit.  

The big question is How?  You can't shorten the primary cycle because then The Other Party would control the news cycles, much like the Democrats are doing now (and they'd do it better).  One idea would be to hold primaries in reverse order of delegate counts.

&gt; We're a loooong way from being able to simulate a living, biological creature of any complexity on a computer.

Irrelevant, all we need to simulate is the immune system and one other thing that's critical. Can be muscles, nerves, whatever.

The goal isn't to upgrade or understand human beings, the goal is to KILL them. You don't need a good simulation to kill people.

Furthermore, how much comprehension of operating systems do you think computer virus writers have? Not much let me tell you. They just need one thing. One single exploit.

&gt; Before I will believe synthetic biology is a threat, let's see that project build something living to begin with, and then let's see how it reacts when it's put into an (contained) ecosystem.

And your second criterion is idiotic because by the time that happens, it will be too fucking late. Do you think I'm talking about an accident here? I'm talking about something DELIBERATE.

"business","t5_2qgzg","The money never existed. At various stages of the game, bad information caused people to assume they had more assets than they actually had.

A quick summary would go something like this:

- Bad mortgages got written to both marginal borrowers (sub-prime) or to individuals with no documentation of income (near-prime, Alt-A)

- Rather than holding the mortgages themselves, the banks turned around and packaged those mortgages into CDOs (basically bundles of mortgages).

- Instead of selling the bundles entirely, they sliced the bundles into ""tranches"" and got third parties (the monoline bond insurers) to give most of the tranches ""AAA"" ratings.

- Once the CDOs were marked ""AAA"" (as good as it gets, even though the underlying mortgages were frequently junk), a whole variety of people around the world bought them, thinking they were much more valuable than they actually were.

- The derivatives and swaps guys were among the buyers, and they developed complicated models with assumptions about the quality of the assets. Those assumptions were wrong.

- The nominal amount of derivatives outstanding ballooned to several times the size of the entire US economy. In ordinary situations this wouldn't be a problem, since total losses are normally much lower than nominal, but the problem is all the players have these inflated assets, so everyone is marking things down and there is the possibility of counterparties failing, which could cause losses approaching nominal.

- The big investment banks became highly leveraged, typically 30x or more. The trouble with this is that at those levels, a 3% loss will wipe out their entire business.

At each level, inflated/misunderstood/misrepresented values of assets fed into even greater misrepresentations. Now the whole house of cards is falling in slow motion.","1207068595"

The reason things aren't publicly available is the damn outdated publishing model.  When you send a paper to journals, you must sign a promise not to put it on the web.

In fact, I do remember the lizard about David Ike.  It was somehow in the back of my mind.  And there was some stuff about Planet X and the lizard people and all that stuff.

Anyway, I think, yes, they are both an old boys club, but they have many people in many important places, judges, politicians and government agencies as well as many media and corporation owners or high up in the corporation, and most certainly the banking infrastructure and the central bank.  They give each other a leg up in the government or corporations &amp; business and so can maintain their brotherhood and some influence.

Yes, The Kirk is a general term.  I'm just listing a few examples of the foundation of the Order of the Knights Templar of Jerusalem in England, Scotland etc that remained and formed into various Masonic Groups.  As well as the important people in the current Masonic groups, they also have the Blue Lodge and other general Masons which don't really know what's going on, and these people convey that the society is innocent - and to most Masons, it largely is.  It's really deep down just a large network of people, but there are many networks within it and across other groups too.

As for Bush &amp; Kerry who are both Skull &amp; Bones Masons, well Bush has successfully lasted almost 8 years, pretended to be stupid and used excuses to secure the resources in Afghanistan and Iraq and perhaps soon to be Iran while avoiding impeachment.  The Administration has the multiple sides of the Iraqi population fighting each other whilst the oil is secured and taken by our corporations.  Nixon couldn't achieve anything close to this.

As for the banking problems of today, it certainly is a mess, but I think this is gradually bound to happen with any Central Banking System centrally creating purely Fiat Debt-Money.  Now their only escape is the opposite of what they did in the 1929-1933 period (described [here](http://youtube.com/watch?v=9V5OP-VmXgE) &amp; [here](http://youtube.com/watch?v=O7pnjzCuSv8)), and to instead create lots of new debt-money, rapidly inflating the money-supply (the amount of money in existence) and so transferring wealth to the failing banks by debasing the fiat currency.  Whatever the Central Bank can do (like print more money or not print more money, and to decide the interest repayment rate on this new debt-money), it's still a terrible mess.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yes I do believe that as well. I think it's a perfect example of a bloated speech. He gets away with it because he is charismatic and people want any excuse to hear his voice. Here are the first few paragraphs of that speech:

&gt; Two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers and scholars; statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787.

OK, this is fine. He wants to weave a story, so I'll give him the leeway to have a beginning to his story.

&gt; The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished. It was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations.

Hmmmm, this is where he starts to go a bit overboard. Unfinished, original sin, divided are are terms he uses to flower up the speech. He could have summed up this whole paragraph into a single sentence saying that ""slavery was an issue not resolved by the founding fathers"". I just reduced his speech.

&gt; Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution - a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty, and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time.

None of this is relevant to anything, he could have left it out entirely.

&gt; And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.

Again, nothing relevant to anything. These are just inspirational words for his audience.

&gt; This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this campaign - to continue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring and more prosperous America. I chose to run for the presidency at this moment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together - unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction - towards a better future for of children and our grandchildren.

He started this paragraph off strong by saying why he was running for office, but then he started rambling again about ""solving challenges"" and childrens future. He probably could have cut this paragraph in half and kept the first half only.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; I'm not a creation literalist. I think Genesis is poetic but contains the substance of great truths.

Sweet, the rational Christian! We're going to be good friends.

&gt; I don't think evolutionary development via mutation disproves God's existence, however if true I do think it has potential to give insight into the nature of God, if He designed us through it.

Definitely. That's the element that confuses me about young-earthers/creationists/IDers: evolutionary theory doesn't eliminate mystery and awe for our universe, it puts the whole thing in perspective. There are plenty of people that appreciate the Einstenian ""god of the universe"" as inspiring and beautiful, and I'm definitely one of them.

This is one of the aspects of the whole debate that confuses me greatly. Why don't creationists and ""evolutionists"" (as if you make a choice to ""believe in"" science) share their appreciation for nature? Whether you call it the universe or Divine Creation, it's still awesome, and we barely understand a fraction of it!

&gt; Science deals in natural explanations for natural phenomena. It simply isn't about the supernatural, except where such things (if they exist) effect the natural.

I don't see a difference between the natural and the supernatural/paranormal/etc. The latter is the universe we live in, the former are nice names for ""things in the universe we don't understand.""

&gt; So the two intersect on how/if the supernatural effects the natural.

Where they really intersect is how/if unknown natural forces effect known natural forces. We might not understand something about the universe, but if we label those things ""supernatural"" what do we do when we discover the natural cause? For example, the ancient Greeks considered lightning as a supernatural phenomenon, but no* modern human would make that claim. Science filled the gaps of the supernatural, but in reality the distinction was only in our minds.

\* Can't be too generalistic, though, as I'm sure some religion or cult -- somewhere -- doesn't subscribe to the scientific explanation for weather.

I read somewhere that it is very dangerous to blow air into the vagina. That it could kill a woman. Is this true?


::Answer::
I too remember being horrified when I first heard about this. Unfortunately, it has become more of an urban legend than a real concern. While it is indeed a theoretical danger, I have never been able to locate a confirmed case in the medical literature, except in cases of pregnancy.

If you were to blow air very strongly into the vagina, with your lips pressed tightly against the vulva (thus preventing escape of the air), it is theoretically possible that you could create what is known as an air embolus. This is a form of embolism, where an air bubble blocks the passage of blood in an artery or vein. In severe cases, if blood flow is completely obstructed, the tissue in that area would die. If the embolus were to travel up to the heart or lungs, it would indeed be possible to die. You should know that when a woman is pregnant, and her cervix begins to dilate, she is more likely to suffer an embolism. In extremely rare cases, this has even been reported to occur from intercourse.

In the days before abortion was legal, many women used to die each year from embolisms created by the insertion of instruments into the uterus. So, yes, you can definitely die from an air embolus, but the question is how likely one is to be created from blowing air into the vagina.

I think it is pretty clear that normal, run-of-the-mill oral sex carries no risk. Even blowing lightly onto the vagina is perfectly fine. I would, however, avoid blowing strongly into the vagina, especially if your partner is pregnant. Otherwise, there is really nothing to worry about -- but I'm glad you asked.

Sometimes someone genuinely enjoys wine, even a specific type of wine, and invites others to see if they also might enjoy it.  That's usually a socially positive behavior.

But far too often, the self-appointed Wine Expert uses his or her putative knowledge of wine as a cudgel with which to enforce notional social status: ""I (claim to) know more about wine than you, therefore I am your social superior.""  That's a socially toxic behavior...

If forced to remain in the company of the latter sort of wine snob, I usually make pointed references to my ability to differentiate between red wine or white wine if the room lighting is good as a way of expressing my contempt for Mr. or Ms. Expert's pretension and posturing...","1207070332"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think you misunderstand me and a lot of American people. Our government doesn't represent us for the most part. It represents the nation itself. The same as every other government ever created. They all lie, kill, imprison and manipulate others for their own benefit. I have no doubt our government is to blame for a lot of horrible things in its history. It is frighteningly bad now and the majority of US citizens are angry and distraught about where Bush and his cabinet have taken our country. We voted Democrats into Congress by a landslide and they still didn't do a damn thing. Not one damn thing to end the madness. They (the government) do NOT represent their employer's (supposedly the population) interests.

Back to what apparently set you off. I never said we were ""benevolent and world leader in freedom and openess"". I said,

&gt;The US has never been perfect and has harbored racism, but compared with the rest of the world and scaling for influence, you could argue the case that the US offered some hope.

Hardly the melodramtic endorsement you claim I'd given. Notice the ""scaling for influence"" part? It's hard to get to the level of power the US has without trampling on others. Thus the ""relative"" part. At times the US has been more imperialistic than any nation in history. However, throughout it all, human rights and representative government has been at the base of it. The government gets in the way sometimes. It actively tries to destroy it at others (Go Bush!).

I agree there are still many in the US that are ignorant, but hopefully even enough of them have had enough by this point. The hope that the US brings to the world is that the people can effect change. They just have to care enough to do it.

As to your accusations, I agree there is deceit. I say that every nation in the history of man has practiced this upon its people. That doesn't make it inherently evil.","1207070363"

Do not overlook, however, the martian polar icecaps, which below the top 20 feet of CO2, are understood to be primarily water ice.  In fact, there's enough water there to cover the whole planet with about 10 feet of water ice.  Polar cap composition figures are from NASA/JPL's Mars Express orbiter.   

The elemental composition of Mars' crust is rather well established by remote spectroscopy and from shattered fragments of Mars' crust that have ended up on Earth.  I didn't discuss mineral composition, just the raw elements because we don't have nearly as much knowledge of the former.   The Spirit and Opportunity rovers' mossbauer spectrometers have largely confirmed that mars crust is a lot like earth crust, with rocks of oxide compounds of silicon, aluminum, iron and magnesium.   Both planets almost certainly formed from the same stardust, and can be expected to have similar elemental compositions.    

That said, I don't mean to overlook the situation here on Earth--the inequality of resource distribution, shortsighted energy policy and continued warmaking by our various tribes only hurts us all, and it is imperative that we do what we can to improve things.     

In 4 billion years of life on earth, there has always been infighting, competition for resources, and some subset of the living population is thriving at the expense of another.    

But in that entire time, not one species has had the opportunity to spread life onto another world--until now.   The ability to spread the seed of Earth life is the single greatest achievement of mankind, and I feel it is our responsibility to do so.  ","1207070503"

That being said, the threat of suppression of reasonable political speech in this case far outweighs the the threat of all of those things mentioned. The limits that they wish to impose cover political cartoons and documentaries about Islam. Since many countries claim Islam as a foundation for the political system, it also protects the that political system from critical  political speech.

It also falls squarely into the definition of ""special protections"" since it covers only insults to Islam. Would the council see fit to limit speech insulting against Hindus? Christians? Jews?

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Nope, there is no ""supposed"" in the combat.  The ships are deliberately unbalanced, so whatever you can do to win, do it.  Some ships only have long-range attacks, some only short, some are deadly at virtually any distance.  Some have special secondary attributes (like ignoring gravity or having an annoying tendency to respawn) to help make them more useful than they might originally seem.  Some matchups are considered nearly impossible against a competent foe, although not as many as you might think.  

*Most* of the ships you'll meet early on have close-range attacks, so keeping them at arm's length is a very good strategy to learn.  And enjoy the Illwrath victory while you can - all other Avengers you come across will have cloaking shields and be much more difficult to take out.

Edit - I feel I should mention, remember that this is a direct port of an early-90s game, so there is a LOT less hand-holding than we see in modern games.  Expect to die a LOT and save frequently.  And you will probably need some rudamentary note-taking and mapping skills, unless you're planning on referring to a FAQ to catch up on hints you forgot to write down.

Plan B often gets confused with RU-486, which *is* an abortion pill. RU-486 will actually kill the fetus.

But, it is misleading!!  It is a statement designed to make people think Obama is the undemocratic one, that he is somehow unfair.

Misleading statements are not really that different than lies in the end, are they?  When Fox news ran 24/7 coverage of allegations that Kerry had a dishonorable record in Vietnam, Fox wasn't lying either.  They were just failing to add that these allegations were baseless.  

The Clintons are the Democratic precursor to Fox's Republican propaganda.  They mislead,  they spin, and they sometimes lie.  The result is that people who disagree with them end up hating them, instead of... just disagreeing.  This I think is why there is so much hatred for Hillary across the country.  It was mostly among Republicans but now it is spreading to Obama supporters.  

Obama, on the other hand, is much more honest.  He doesn't lie.  He doesn't mislead.  And he rarely even spins.  I think this is why he has so much support among independents.  ","1207071127"

"politics","t5_2cneq","OK,

-------

Quite an amazingly candid and rather politically juicy interview occurred yesterday with Clinton supporter and super-delegate Congressman Rev. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City on the CBC Radio (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) show The Sunday Edition yesterday.

Among the many interesting things Rev. Cleaver, who is Missouri co-chair for the Clinton campaign, said is ""If I had to make a prediction right now, I'd have to say Barack Obama's going to be the next President"" and a few seconds later ""I will be stunned if he's not the next President of the United States"". This occurs at the 18:08 point of the audio posted on CBC's Sunday Edition web page at http://www.cbc.ca/thesundayedition

Other points Rev. Cleaver makes:

""I'm outraged over the outrage at the Wright controversy""

When asked by the CBC interviewer, Michael Enright if the continued race is doing damage to the party he says it is primarily the ""enthusiasm of the supporters"" that is causing the damage, echoing one of Obama's observations on ""The View"".

At the 13:49 point of the interview he states what he says is the Clinton campaign ""party line"" about the nomination race, stating that the continued race is good for the party and for America, then goes on to state his real opinion that it is the ""tragedy of tragedies"" and may put McCain in the White House.

""If we had this kind of process in any other country to select a leader, we'd be asking the UN for an intervention."" ""... this is unbelievably stupid.""

""Many white Americans"" are saying ""this is our chance to demonstrate that we have been able to get this boogeyman called race behind us and so they're going to vote for [Obama]""

Now I'm wondering what prompted Rev. Cleaver to be so candid. This can't be going down well with Clinton and her top brass.

Does that cover it? Or is there more despair I missed? I'm sure we can find more. The fed wants to rape you, we'll all be broke when the boomers retire.

Read [this long article](http://rawstory.com/news/2008/How_Bush_US_attorney_riddled_with_0401.html).

Republicans are currently operating a ruthless power-hungry grab bag game of dirty tricks. Currently the democrats, if you read the article, are not playing that game. That could change in the future and my support for them will thus change, but right now, they're running a pretty good campaign.

And although I criticize the fed, I know a solution - Ron Paul - and his message will be heard if not now then later. For the baby boomers retiring, economists like Kotlikoff offer solutions. My point is, for every complaint there's a solution and hopelessness is not an option. If democrats abandon their path to that of the GOP, we'll form another party.

The number of Arabs killed in all the conflicts with Israel, including wars, since 1948 is approximately 60,000

No genocide and no atrocity was/is being committed against so called ""Palestinians"". The fact of the matter is that approximately 20% of the population of Israel is Arab, majority of it is Muslim and it enjoys the highest standards of life in the Middle East.

I respect your opinion and I thank you for it, but as someone who lives here in Israel I can assure you that even if we do rethink our position it will be towards toughening our stance against the Muslim assault on our country, and we'll defend and protect our small piece of land with everything we can.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Rights are allowances to do something within the political system. For instance, the right to free speech is a function in the political code to allow citizens to speak freely even in defiance of the system.

A ""gay"" is a person who adopts a lifestyle that involves exclusive preference for romantic/sensual relations with the same sex.

The only reason for ""gay rights"" is for allowances written in the political code to specifically grant functions to gays.

The marriage functions have the purpose of establishing a registered familial unit for action within the political system.

We do this because males and females come together to procreate, and a two-person monogamous household is standard.

The marriage functions then provide for a layer of political code for registered parents to have special allowances.

Some married couples don't have babies, but most do and are capable even if they don't. Marriage helps integrate mating with politics.

The political system is not the primary reality. Couples are free to have the same relations without marriage registration.

They can also have other variations. But marriage is for registration in the coded system. It can be viewed like reddit.

reddit lets you register an account and do certain things with it. reddit accounts are single, there are no team/group functions.

But we could still form teams, and use other sites to communicate and have a group of people working together to submit/vote.

Gay rights is like if we with our new teams petitioned reddit coders to add native team functions to the reddit.com software.

They would say, ""Most people don't do that. There's not much benefit, and you can do it anyways."" That is like denying gay marriage.

Right now it is popular to be pro-gay, just as not long ago it was popular to be anti-gay. But most people don't really understand.

The practices of those who call themselves gays, bis, swingers, pedos, or whatever else comes along are free variations of lifestyle.

But unless there is a functional beneficial reason their lifestyle should be coded into the political system, it won't be.

One could argue even the marriage system is best left undefined in the legal code, treating all accounts as individual like reddit.","1207071625"

"science","t5_mouw","I'm all for open access.

I recently attended an information session on open access in my university hosted by the library. As some of you may know, libraries like open access journals - it saves them money.

They did point out one valid criticism of the NIH requirements. If the NIH finds that researchers are violating the rules (by publishing in journals that do not allow the articles to be put on free repositories like PubMed), then they reserve the right to punish the **institution** by not allowing them to get any more NIH research money.

The reason is that officially, grants are given not to researchers, but to institutions. My professor may do all the work to get the grant, but officially it is not granted to him, but to the university. His status is that of ""principal agent"".

The reason the library and university are unhappy about this rule is that it now becomes *their* burden (and not the researcher's) to monitor the faculty and make sure they comply - because they're the ones who will get screwed more than the researchers.

All in all, I'm for the policy. I think they should just amend their rules to state that any grant listing the offending faculty/researchers will be denied in future - rather than punish the whole institution.","1207072121"

and if you go to the article, you see this in the section where they talk about the energy required to build the vehicles:

&gt;# Hummer H2: 200.717 mmBTU
# Toyota Prius: 113.322 mmBTU

Now, if you concentrate really, really hard, you will eventually come to the conclusion that Hummer requires more energy to make.  If you don't, think harder.  If this doesn't work, then ask your dad Herr Seinkonnen der Elter or whatever for some help.

Now, I note that you quote energy per weight to make your comparison.  to which, I reply, so the fuck what.  Our planet cares not a whit that per pound a Hummer uses less energy to make.  It only notices that the Hummer requires much more total energy, and continues to use more over time to operate.

Part of the problem with the marriage debate is that people bring radically different conceptions of what a marriage is supposed to be to the table, conflating the cultural ideals of a loving partnership with the governmental mish-mash of shared property rules and nuclear family incentives.

During the period of time when housing was appreciating at an 11% anualized clip year over year, and you could put a piece of dog shit with a lawn on the market and it would sell, things were tough for a listing agent. (Not to mention a buyer's agent.)

Why on earth would you pay 6% to a realtor, when just paying a company, ANY company to get in on your local MLS was all you needed to do to get it sold? 

For a few years, companies that specialized in MLS entry only drove down realtor commissions by offering less than full service listing agreements. In a market where regardless of who you list with, you stand to recieve multiple offers, the incentive to have a full service agent is very limited, and only the most agressively priced listing/buyer's agents stand to garner the most interest from the public. 

I cannot stress enough that this was only true in the short time period where every person in the U.S decided their home was more like a money tree and less like a home. 

Now that reality is sinking in, and sellers are having to really market their homes in order to generate activity, a full service realtor is just what they need, and in fact just what they are paying for. 

In California at least, the trend has already come full circle, where the full service companies again control all of the inventory, and commission totals for both listing/selling sides of the commission now average 6% again. 

Any area experiencing a downturn will follow this same trend. Why would a realtor work harder for less money? You wouldn't, and I expect they won't either.","1207072503"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;I suppose, I'm a little worried about survival rate for journals that, up to this point, have been subscription based, and will suddenly find themselves handed out for free.

For most journals, no one is forcing open access. 

A lot of journals from professional institutions (IEEE, AIP, APS, etc) give the article's authors the possibility of making their article open access (for a fee, of course). 

And even if you don't make it open access, some of those (AIP for sure) state that the authors are free to put the final pre-print (but post-refereed) version on online repositories, Web sites, etc - as long as a suitable citation is provided to the AIP journal. In this case, the article is *not* open access - the journal owns the copyright. But people are free to read it.

From my understanding, the NIH policy is not forcing these articles/journals to be open access. They're just trying to implement changes to the copyright transfer agreement similar to the AIP one in the previous paragraph.","1207072851"

You have to take in to consideration the total number of Prius hybrids made vs the total number of Hummer H2s made, where energy used per pound comes in to play (hopefully I don't have to explain why). Thats what the earth really cares about.

Toyota made 300,000 hybrids in 2007. And I'm going to guess that there were far less H2s made in 07. But if you can find the numbers to prove me wrong (I can't find the production numbers), then go ahead.

And just to win the argument once and for all: Per number of cars made + energy used per pound, in TOTAL, the Prius uses FAR more energy to produce then the TOTAL number of H2s ever made. The end. 

A million hybrids ANNUALLY by 2010.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Agreed, obviously Obama wants this to end sooner rather than later for the better of the party's focus and so that he can shift focus personally as well. That's a *sane* standpoint on this issue.

So this is a ""lie"" (to use as strong words as the submitter) by Obama too to come off as self confident and a strong leader. Which by itself may not be *false*, but the intention is to be shown in good light. Conversely, saying ""yes, I'd prefer this to end sooner rather than later for the better of the party's focus"" would, although more truthful, cast doubts on other aspects of his qualifications as a self confident and strong leader.

It's all part of the political game, so let's not be *too* Obama-biased here.

On the other hand, Clinton is twisting words in that she's saying ""before millions have their say"", when in reality Obama probably wants it to end sooner for other reasons, to shift focus and not spend efforts on something that could weaken the party in a suicidal struggle by Clinton.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Even though I know it's VERY unpopular here (why?), I think the FUD-reaction to this kind of thing is pretty appalling.  To be fair, I make a good living using what we call alt.net and FOSS with the MS stack.  The rampant ignorance here about what is _actually_ going on in MS development amounts to the Reddit masses collectively living with their head in the sand.  

What strikes me reading the responses here is the widespread ignorance:  You just don't know what you are talking about. And I don't mean that as an insult; it's just crystal clear that you have zero expertise in this domain.  Do you see me making ill-informed, blanket statements in Rails forums? C++?   Of course not. I don't live in that realm and I'm smart enough to know what I don't know. The word is fatuous:  You're clueless, but think you aren't.  It's OK; I've done it too. 

I think the only real argument here is that there is fear about MS changing their licensing and sinking a bunch of projects like Mono.  Miguel DeIcaza can explain it better than I, but this just isn't possible.  It's the equivalent of Unix/SCO somehow taking out all of the Linux products that grew from it.  Never. Going. To happen. 

Perhaps you may consider simply taking MS at their word on this issue: (are you off the floor yet?) It's all about the developer.  If MS did a U-turn on all of their licensing, me and every MS-stack dev I know would immediately flood the web with complaints and we would all move to a different platform.  Yes, really.  

Also, Scott Hanselman is smarter than the best Linux programmer you know.  Miguel de Icaza is a better programmer (and smarter) than everyone reading this. They are both huge proponents of alt.net and the .NET CLR. Ask yourself:  Why would a talented Linux hacker make Mono?  Why would he then make Moonlight? (yes, Silverlight will eclipse Flash).  You know, just maybe think about it. MS is VERY far from the Evil Empire run by a young Bill Gates. I'm not saying they're altruistic, but they are smart enough to know that developers come first.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Your post implied that Islam is a major problem, and that a logical solution to this ""problem"" is to ban immigration of Muslims (as b34nz suggested).

Even if I agree with that - I'm not against Islam per-se but against the Islamisation of Europe through mass immigration - I was referring essentially to the difference in voting. Voters appeared to agree that ""Islam is a major problem"" when present in an ill-define ""Western World"", but seem to be against discriminatory immigration control.

&gt;These are the ideas which I am contesting.

Yes, I understand.

&gt;The exploitation of xenophobia materializes as violence, coercion, and power grabs -- all of which tend to inspire backlashes, used to whip up a frenzy of future cultural warriors in a perpetual cycle whose only beneficiaries are the profiteers.

I also understand that, which is why I never seen such problems occur in homogeneous societies. The first step for racism, xenophobia and related violence is so-called multiculturalism.

This is however another debate, in which we will strongly disagree and it's hardly worth pursuing : my initial point was, again, merely against the discrepancy in voting between the person who sad ""they are prejudicial to us"" and the one who concluded ""... maybe we should do something about it"". 

Since you don't subscribe to the first assertion there is no inconsistency in your position.

Why is the 6 month idea bad? It has little practical significance. You rarely have papers published that will have so much significance that you *need* access to it immediately.

It's a compromise for the publishers. Let's face it - running a journal is not a free enterprise. It costs money. Yes, a lot of commercial journals charge astronomical fees, but bringing them down to 0 won't help.

If the NIH wants to publicly fund their own non-profit journals and pay for all expenses, then I could see your point. 

The whole NIH initiative, I suspect, is to arrest the price abuse that the journals were involved in - not to kill their business model.

Fact is, there are a multitude of other propulsion technologies, some in their infancy, that can provide us with *impressive accelerations with smaller payloads*. A warp drive (as in antimatter/matter engine, not spacetime warp), far from being ""magical,"" is both theoretically and **physically** possible. Unfortunately, we cannot reliably produce or contain antimatter yet, so we cannot create an engine that uses energey from matter/antimatter reactions. But guess what? **We will.** Differential ion propulsion, and heck -- using hydrogen bombs and oodles of nuclear fuel -- are also within reach but undoable for a variety of reasons.

It may surprise you to learn that I'm an engineer, and in fact, am working (in my own little way) to make things like this real. Having naysayers like you sit at the sidelines shouting ""It can't be done"" is unhelpful and, frankly, makes you look foolish.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm a Ron Paul fan myself, but I agree with some of the criticism levied at the campaign and his supporter base.  One of the issues I've been trying to hammer home with libertarians is the need for social and political strength.  

Ron Paul's biggest strength was his ability to connect with people who are fed up with both parties.  He needed to use his people skills to connect with people trapped in the left-right paradigm.  His Internet revolution was the strongest the world has seen, but it isn't enough when supporters and advocates aren't willing to come to the table to talk. 

If it's true that we live in a two-party system, then short of a violent revolution, libertarians don't have a shot at winning a general election.  The reason I say this is the decision NOT to participate in the ""political game"".

Either this is an April Fool's day gag, or that PC has a serious heat problem and would probably just catch fire if not submerged in oil. 

On second thought, if you consider that the typical PC has, maybe, a 500 watt power supply (and many have only 350W.)...there is NO WAY that the quantity of oil shown can be heated by that small amount of power, to cook French fries like that.

The entire infrastructure built on years of proven method should all take the time and resources to port their methods over to my new protocol so I can be included. People using my system will only be a small percentage of the entire web, but I demand my rights!

Here's the deal. Start your family, do your best, others will do the same. If you're onto something that actually works, more will follow. Once there is a history and we know this isn't some fly-by-night concept that will be dead in 20 years with people looking back going, ""WTF were we thinking!?"", then it will be added to the political system.

This is true for all variations of lifestyles. Including alternative parenting, schooling, careers, etc. Start a familial system where it's lottery and every 3 months partners switch. Start one where everyone lives alone in small domes in a tight community, and every wednesday night they all get together to have an orgy, and the days are spent shared parenting the collective children.

Diversity is fine. Experiment. But our political system should not change to accept every new idea. It is very difficult for newcomers/outsiders. That will never change. It is part of the test to make sure the new idea is actually stable and not dangerously flawed. 

Sure it'd be nice if you could skip all of that. But I'd also like to instantly have my new technology embraced by the public too. That's not how it works. You are in for a huge challenge, and the answer is not getting angry about not having laws written for you.

The telephone number they quoted appeared to be one that I had actually owned back in 1998. After some googling, I found a good strategy: Send them back a very polite letter:

Ref: Acct# xxxxx

Dear Sirs,

I am writing to you with respect to the above referenced collection notice.

In order to proceed with this matter, I will need the following from you:

1. The amount of the debt, including documentation of how this number was calculated
2. The name and address of the original creditor
3. Verification of the debt, including:
i. Copies of any papers that show I contracted and agreed to pay for the service you are saying I owe money for;
ii. Documentation of how and when the debt was incurred;
iii. A copy of any judgment against me, if applicable;
iv. Proof that this request is within the statute of limitations for collection;
v. Proof that you are licensed to collect in my state;
vi. Your license numbers and Registered Agent.

Once I have the above information to my satisfaction then we may proceed onto the next step toward resolving this matter.

Yours sincerely, etc

I sent this letter, and sure enough a couple of weeks later I got back another letter from them telling me that the matter had been closed. So basically you call their bluff - it's very old debt, there's no way they can dig up any documentation on it, they are just trying their luck and counting on most people to be so afraid of collection agencies ruining their credit that many will simply pay up (since it's usually not that much money they're asking for). They are legally required to provide documentation of the debt to you on request, but they have no way of proving it, so you win. And if they do happen to provide real proof, then go from there - after all, if you really do owe them money, then they have you fair and square, at least you tried.

You don't lose anything by doing this. Just keep it polite - I had to edit the above letter several times to remove the emotional/insulting remarks that kept creeping in as I was writing the first draft.

Also, google the name of the collection company that sends you the letter, almost guaranteed you'll find slews of complaints on forums across the 'net, along with some good advice on how to deal.","1207074695"

"reddit.com","t5_6","cracked.com's take on James Blunt -

""Who Is This Wuss?


James Blunt is the helium-voiced, Jagger-lipped balladeer who burst onto the scene in 2005 with your mom's favorite song, ""You're Beautiful."" Once his career took off, Blunt could be found every time you turned on your fucking radio or television, including on such rawk-ready shows as Oprah and Sesame Street, where he sang a reworked version of ""You're Beautiful"" called ""Triangles."" Jesus tapdancing Christ.


According to our friend Wikipedia, ""You're Beautiful"" received massive airplay in the U.K., which helped propel Blunt's debut album, Back To Bedlam, to No. 1 on the U.K. albums chart. This helped unseat Coldplay's X&amp;Y from the pole position, a fact we only mention because those last few words manage to make James Blunt and Coldplay sound even gayer. In short, James Blunt is the kind of guy you'd probably like to punch clean in the face. If he walked into the room, the only thing stopping you would probably be a sense of pity, and possibly the fear of doing some sort of lasting damage to his delicate, child-like frame.


Why He Owns You:



Have you ever driven a tank? James Blunt has. Before launching a career in leprechaun troubadourism, James Blunt served as a captain in the British Army. Granted, it's the British Army, but you can bet your ass that the training required to make captain involves learning several techniques that would see to it that he could whoop your ass six ways to Sunday before you land a single womanly slap.


To make matters worse (for you), during the war in Kosovo Blunt was put in charge of leading 30,000 troops into the Kosovan capital. So not only could he fuck you up proper, he's the type of dude that people put in charge of ordering around tens of thousands of other men fully capable of doing the same. It should go without saying he leaves a trail of vanquished supermodels in his wake wherever he goes.""

Another upside is that he does know he's won, and if he can win legitimatly through having more delegates, his nomination will feel more solid &amp; secure, and wouldn't have been won by the super delegates taking the floor out from under Hillary. He's not going to try and push her out publicly because it will make his win seem that much more earned by the voters, that through their hard work and constant support, they were able to win at the end. Because of the Voters, and not because of the party elite (super delegates). That's why Obama wants the super delegates to vote the way of the voters, so he can say that it was the voters who gave the win.

"reddit.com","t5_6","This is what my family uses to track our expenses, and with all the bad credit, mortgage problems and rising prices you here about these days, I thought it might be helpful to share it with other people. I've deleted all the personal information, but kept in our expenses to give you an example to start with, and uploaded the Microsoft Excel document here:

http://stashbox.org/97924/realitycheck.xls

You just need to update the Wife and/or Husband columns with the monthly $$ you spend on each item, and it will calculate the NET and GROSS incomes needed to support your lifestyle. It also shows you how much money you'll need to save per paycheck, and how much you'll need in the bank if you only wanted to live off the interest (which is useful if you're planning for retirement)

Please rename, add or delete items to accommodate your unique lifestyle, and let me know if you need help with updating any of the formulas. One note, it's easier to add a new row in between two existing rows, rather than at the end of all the items. This way all the formulas will get updated automatically.

Some strange numbers you might notice is that our monthly cellphone expenses are really cheap, that's because we don't use them much and are on 2 prepaid plans. Also, I work at home and don't smoke very much, so that's why my Cigarettes and Going Out For expenses might seem low. Though I do spend a lot in books :) Also, I haven't updated our Health Insurance columns yet.

Cheers!","1207075283"

"reddit.com","t5_6","If anything, I'm becoming more and more convinced that the entire evangelical movement, if not even the whole ""Creationist"" Nonsense, is actually being spearheaded by a group of Atheist Humanists to undermine the Evangelical Philosophical viewpoint.

Creationism and Dominionism taken as a set have completely alienated the modern Christian Movement from the country's mainstream.  Individuals are told you either believe in physical reality, as represented by all of the physical comforts that surround us, OR you believe in some ephemeral anthropomorphic deity and reject physical reality.  Faced with this choice, I did not know a single individual in College who made it through all four years with their faith unscathed.  Simply put, Modern Christians are shooting themselves in the foot by making the question of faith such a blatantly black-and-white choice.  For all the hooplah about 'developing a personal relationship with god', the Dominionist and Creationist camps are busy making that impossible as they refuse to stop SCREAMING at the world ""our way or no way!""

And yet, the poor sheep are so indoctrinated they fail to see that their passion for their faith is being used against them.  Kent Hovind and his ilk portray evangelical Christians as childish, closeminded, and utterly lacking in any concept of the philosophy of science and the sheep lap it up, responding like conditioned animals to the mere sound of religious language.  Its a great Gig-  Tap the right emotions, and you can get a Christian to agree to damn near anything.  Get them agree to stupid shit, and you make them look stupid.

If you don't deal with it correctly, it can wind up on your credit report; even though it happened in 1999, recent activity (say, their attempt to collect right now) can reset the 7 year clock on it.

What you do is ask for their mailing address and send them a certified letter demanding that they contact you only in writing, and that they prove the validity of the debt. I don't recall if it's 30 or 60 days, but if they can't, they have to retire the debt and have it removed from your credit report. If it's not off your credit report in 90-180 days, send copies of the correspondence to the credit agency.

They probably bought a bill from AT&amp;T and started fishing for people with the same name, hoping _someone_ would just pony up the $27 to get off the phone, and referring you back to AT&amp;T is a way to divert you from the correct actions to make it go away legitimately.

We don't.

If persons are using such methods, they are missing something very basic in Scientology.

This is the whole point of the policy ""Keeping Scientology Working"" - You don't do the stupid shit that screws things up.

This was written well before a lot of the shit hit the fan. 

You would be surprised how many people want to mix Scientology with things like electric shock or astrology or any number of other things to fit their own agenda, any number of things that they think is the best way to do stuff.

You actually see this in any number of technical fields, where people read the documentation and the manuals and screw it all up and wonder how they deleted all of their backups; and it is up to a few technical wizards to put things back together.

The amount of literacy that is needed to be able to read and apply what is on a basic written page surpasses what many people have at their fingertips.

That is why Study Tech was developed, and we have the policies. You cannot depend on just a talented few. You have to be able to make sure that everyone gets it.

People who are in fact criminals probably are not limited to any one single crime. They likely have more than one, even if they have not been caught, or even commonly accepted.

The impulse to destroy has more risk associated with it than the impulse to create. Solutions which involve crimes against humanity, or even merely widespread hatred, put YOU at risk. 

Make your choices wisely.

*Last time I looked, we live in a country with the freedom of expression. I could personally care less of what you thought of my position on several different topics. However, when you attack me personally then yes, you are accountable to the laws of the land - not above them!*

I agree with the idea of obeying the laws of the land. This would be a great idea for the USA. 

Sort of along the line of the answer to the question asked of Ghandi - ""What did he think of Western Civilization?"" His answer was that he though it would be a good idea.

We advocate that all Scientologists should support their local government. We also advocate for a government run for the benefit of all of the people, not just a lucky few.

If you attack us, then do not expect us to lie down meekly.

You run into a cognitive dissonance when you say Stop doing X, we say that we advocate against X.

If you want to have a philosophical discussion, fine. If you want to clarify your understanding of what I believe, fine.

If you find it impossible to believe my beliefs are sincere, then you will freak out all the more, as more and more evidence appears that contradicts what you hold dear, because if what you believe is true, then it is impossible for me to have any sincere beliefs.

I point you to the video channel on Scientology.org because those materials really summarize our beliefs far better than a long laborious rant.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Yes, but how many bash scripts are really made for widespread adoption?

Who cares? My point is that non-browser JavaScript environments are ubiquitous.

&gt; By their nature, they tend to be oriented around system and server management, something which Linux and its cousins are still doing well at compared to Windows.

Again, who cares how well Linux does with it? I wasn't arguing that Windows was better at system management.

Pointing out that replacing bash with JavaScript is difficult doesn't do anything to contradict the fact that JavaScript is available as a non-browser scripting language on the vast majority of computers and has far more installations than bash could ever hope to achieve.

As far as I know, other than lacking the special privileges, it is not illegal to play with new households consisting of same sex parents. It is also not illegal to homeschool, build communes, etc.

But as soon as a new idea for how to live is flat out illegal, get in there and fight for rights. Right now adults can do pretty much anything. The illegal stuff involves parenting. 

Give your son some marijuana in peace pipe ceremony? Probably lose him. Teach him about sex through hands-on experience? Definitely lose him. Are you outraged about that? Maybe not, because it doesn't involve your lifestyle.

But if I were a same-sex parent right now I wouldn't be fighting for marriage rights. I'd be fighting against people legally able to step in and take my children. That'll be the first attack. They'll say you're harming them with your lifestyle, are unfit, and haul them off.

Edit: Never mind, I see now.  If you have integers outside of a hash table, there won't be enough that you'd care.  Since there's no dense arrays, large numbers of integers always will be in a hash table.  I guess the way out would be to encode them in a string or something.","1207075721"

"reddit.com","t5_6","what is your argument with me exactly?



In answer to your commentary... first I would say, 
(figures direct from wakeupwalmart.com) 

The second most common job at Wal-Mart, earned approximately $7.92 per hour and worked 29 hours a week (that was in 2003, it is most likely higher now), this is not including any possible insurance or other benefits many do get. (almost every other job earns more $$$ BTW)


Not that 8 bucks is much better than 6 or anything but trying to bolster your anti Wal-Mart rhetoric by pretending that a “family” exists on a single non full time Wal-Mart paycheck when we all know the cashiers are staffed by uncaring teenagers is really disingenuous and most of us who actually look at reality when we think about things see right through the bullshit.


This is why there isn’t a massive “uproar” about Wal-Mart.. We are constantly being hit with anti Wal-Mart rhetoric that is based on the lowest common denominator, extreme examples or outright distorted facts and once we see it.. the rhetoric (even if true) is permanently marred.



You,.. your $6 comment.. helps make that happen.


Now,  I was obviously exaggerating and expounding on your comment, but it is typical of a Wal-Mart basher to over look reality to bolster the evil Wal-Mart image.


Then I would continue to say, if one is making $6.00 at Wal-Mart then he should get an education because if he is  stuck making $6 an hour he is either handicapped, really, really old  or is a lazy ass.  

The lowest paid employees do not stay the lowest paid employees for long, unless of course, they suck.. and then Wal-Mart should get some money back.



I would also say he is 1000 times better off than that Chinese ""slave"" you are referring to.

"science","t5_mouw","If all you taste is alcohol in wine, you're missing some taste receptors or you're drinking Night Train.

Ditto coffee.

I really hate to break it to you and to all of those who think that beer, wine, scotch, coffee, and tea, are only drunk for their psychoactive effects, but you are, for lack of a better word (and I really wish there was a better one), philistines.  That may be why *you* drink it.  Which is fair, if a little sad.

Indeed, drinking a lot of a very cheap wine or an expensive one will get you drunk.  Cheap coffee and expensive coffee will get you wired.  The fact is, they taste different to me and to many people.  Why would we pay a little more to drink something we like?  Because there's more to it than the psychoactive effect.  Don't believe me?  Then explain coffee-flavored ice cream.  I love the flavor and scent/smell/aroma of coffee.  I would drink coffee if it had no caffeine.  I would drink beer if it had no alcohol.  I'm glad both do have those constituents, but there's a lot more to them than that.

A lot of people drinking coffee and beer don't fucking *deserve* to drink coffee and beer.

Ditto scotch, especially peaty, smoky, cantankerous Islay scotches that fucking ROAR when you bring the glass near to your nose.  It's like an archangel sliding up to you and bracing against you for support while he fights the demons of bland mediocrity.  God DAMN I love strong, assertive scotch.

These I will very occasionally pay a premium for, because they taste nothing like, oh, Clan MacGregor.  Either will get me wasted, but if you're drinking expensive scotch to get wasted, you're kind of an asshole (you might get a little wasted in the *process* of drinking the sea and peat fire, of course, but that is, you know, an added benefit.)

In your case, I definitely suggest you buy your coffee and alcohol at a gas station, because to you it does not matter, but it is a *fact* that it does matter to most people who profess to be fans of these beverages.

Do I believe that the range of tastes is as great as connoisseurs claim?  No.  Do I believe that any bottle of wine is worth, say, $500, to me, personally?  No.

The truly sad thing about wine ""culture,"" is it is horribly confused about what wine is for.  Good wine should be drunk as a zesty salute to life.  The wine I choose over any other is Ravenswood red zinfandel, an unpretentious, hearty wine that I get for about $9-$11 a bottle.  

I like to drink it with really garlicky Italian food, and I drink it in gulps like a Klingon, and it makes me happy.  There is nothing effete either about the wine I drink, or how or why I drink it.  Good wine is distilled from the soul of the earth.  If you can't see that, I feel bad for you.

Everyone is well aware that there are cheaper ways to get drunk.

And as for Dixie Cups, the reason not to serve wine in a fucking dixie cups is DIXIE CUPS DO NOT HOLD ENOUGH WINE FOR GROWN MEN.","1207076247"

You are there when the application is there after some years it becomes so outdated that they have to completely change the technology(excel sheets to web application).

In fact, if he/she did, he/she could be slapped with a discrimination claim from the buyer, the seller, the other realtor, (or all of the above). Disclosing that is the equivalent of disclosing the fact that there are gays, african americans, latinos, or any other race or social status living nearby.

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Most of it is still highly relevant.  Example:

&gt; In Ruby (like in Pascal), to call a function WITH arguments you pass the args (normally in parentheses, though that is not invariably the case) -- BUT if the function takes no args then simply mentioning the function implicitly calls it. […] to me, it means the mere mention of an object may EITHER mean a reference to the object, OR a call to the object, depending on the object's type -- and in those cases where I can't get a reference to the object by merely mentioning it I will need to use explicit ""give me a reference to this, DON'T call it!"" operators that aren't needed otherwise. I feel this impacts the ""first-classness"" of functions (or methods, or other callable objects) and the possibility of interchanging objects smoothly.

This is the single Ruby design decision that is most head-scratchingly bizarre to me. It's impossible to determine, from visual inspection, whether a fragment of code represents a reference or a call. Syntactically, this is a win for people looking to make Ruby-based DSLs, but semantically this just blows the back of my head straight off.  (Tied into this is the odd non-interchangeability of blocks and Procs, but that's a less pressing complaint, and besides, Python sucks eggs when it comes to ad-hoc creation of anonymous bits of code, so perhaps this is a win for Ruby anyway.)","1207076714"

It's an important technique used by archaeologists to determine the ages of organic remains, up to about 45,000 years. The basic idea is that plants, while living, take in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which contains a certain amount of the radioisotope carbon-14. Animals then eat the plants, and so basically all living things maintain some proportion of carbon-14 to carbon-12 until they die, at which point the level begins to slowly decrease by radioactive decay. The rate of decay is known, and along with various other known factors, can be used to approximately determine the time at which the plant or animal died.","1207076906"

"reddit.com","t5_6","The article never questions the logic of compulsion. FDA was a tax-payer funded (""user"" fees from industry have undermined that) agency intended to reach public determinations of the merits of medicines. It is natural to assume that most people will follow its recommendations.

The freedom to go against its recommendations is a double edged sword. When the FDA is working well, those who do not follow its recommendations suffer from dangerous and ineffective medicines and learn better. When the FDA is working badly, those who do not follow its recommendations expose the FDA's error and the FDA learns better. Such contestibility has a heavy price but it does provide a feedback mechanism to ""close the loop"" on regulation and avoid the FDA lurching from crisis to crisis.

However, FDA recommendations are compulsory. If the FDA is too ready to grant approval, that is visible, with adverse reactions. If the FDA is too slow to grant approval, that is hidden, with no-body permited to take the drug in defiance of FDA rulings. The first stage of the logic of compulsion is to create a system that inherently tends to delay.

Well, you can compare the FDA against foreign regulators and discover that the FDA is too slow. But then what? You can bdoge the system with, for example, artifical deadlines and speed things up until you have a disaster with an over hasty approval. That does not provide a ""closed loop"" framework.

The interesting idea is to drop compulsion. Then there is a symmetry between being too slow and too quick and the FDA can actually aim to be in the middle.

You seem to be inherently incapable of looking at the bigger picture. Per unit of anything doesn't mean much when the per unit savings of whatever are eclipsed by the mass number of units. 

If you create a human that uses 50% less energy, and then you make 12 billion of them (twice our population), you negate or offset that 50% reduction in energy by mass quantity (their energy use is now equivalent to our 6 billion people, gaining us nothing).

Obama is a huge supporter of transparent government.  Hence the 6 years of tax returns on the table for everyone to see.

Hillary is past her prime.. she's a fine and decent woman, but Obama is the man of the times. Her latest actions of trying to play dirty politics is just disgraceful. McCain is in bed with the NeoCons.  No way the republicans get another 4 years to fuck things up more.  They had their chance, they screwed it up bigtime.

http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7046

It says this:

&gt; This is because large amounts of carbon tied up in trees and other plants are released when the reservoir is initially flooded and the plants rot. Then after this first pulse of decay, plant matter settling on the reservoir's bottom decomposes without oxygen, resulting in a build-up of dissolved methane. This is released into the atmosphere when water passes through the dam's turbines.

And that's compared in the article to oil-powered plants.

It's a far cry from your allegation of ""hydroelectric causing global warming more so than coal plants"".  Please don't spread misinformation.

There's some more detail that complicates things, but in the end it looks like hydro is relatively fine.

This in itself shouldn't be a problem as less developed countries who rely on such imports should be able to accommodate the fall in supply with a step up in domestic production. 
However, due to the over production of foodstuffs in places like the EU and North America (caused by effectively protectionist government policy) over the past decade, this is not the case. Years of dumping of excess supply on world markets have caused less developed countries to be priced out of their vital export markets and has resulted in a collapse in investment in agriculture in such countries.

Maybe the answer is that we publish all obscure manuscripts in PLoS one, eliminating the diversity of journals, diversity of mission statements, and unifications of concepts in reputable sources for those concepts. Not sure I like this. 

Why doesn't PubMed, rather NIH, start giving grants to all the non-profit journals/societies in order for them to turn themselves into open access sources?

"programming","t5_2fwo","Lua is an interesting comparison. Lua ""tables"" are much lighter-weight because they incorporate both a hash table and an actual array.  The runtime decides the most efficient way to store each mapping in the table, so if you're using a table like an array you won't have any unexpected per-element overhead. You can read more about it in the [Implementation of Lua 5.0](http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~lhf/ftp/doc/jucs05.pdf) (pdf).

PHP arrays are a bit more complicated because they are ordered (where Lua tables are not). Personally I think this is a huge mistake, since the use cases for unordered hash tables and ordered lists rarely overlap, but oh well, I guess people like not having to choose an appropriate datastructure. Depending on how the ordering is implemented (maybe just a supplemental linked list of keys), maybe Lua's approach would work for PHP too.","1207078244"

&gt;...in the United States the National Association of Realtors in 1949 obtained preregistrations for the words REALTOR and REALTORS as collective trade marks. As long as the trademarks are maintained, the words cannot be used in commerce by other parties in a way that is likely to cause confusion as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of goods, services, or commercial activities in the domain of real estate. The NAR only authorizes usage by National Association of Realtors members or licensees.

...

&gt;In 2003, Jacob Joseph Zimmerman, a real estate agent who was not a member of NAR, petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the trademarks, on the ground that ""realtor"" and ""realtors"" were generic terms rather than a trademark. On March 31, 2004, the USPTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board denied the petition, holding that the words continued to function as collective service marks and have not become generic terms.

in a simple thermal fission rocket, you heat a gas and send it out the nozzle.  since hydrogen is less massy than uranium, (and temperature is a measure of particle kinetic energy, not velocity) heating atoms (little marbles, you might say) of hydrogen will always yield a higher exhaust velocity (thus  higher specific impulse) than heating atoms of uranium to a given temperature.       

You can plug in your own numbers into this simplified thrust equation to see for yourself:   

F = mdot * Ve

(F is thrust, mdot is mass flow rate, Ve is exhaust velocity)

You accuse me of believing that all guerrila warefare is wrong and that all armed militaries are good, this is not my believe in the slightest. It is my belief that Hamas is bad and that Israel (who was attacked by all of its neighbors in '48 and '67) has the right to defend itself from a legitimate and ongoing threat.

You are the one dealing in absolutes. Your rant makes it quite clear that you think that those involved in guerrilla warefare are likely right. 

There have been plenty of armed resistances full of real freedom fighters who were justified in their actions, but this situation is not one of them. 
My evidence for my beliefs is plentiful. It can most poignently be explained by former Palestinian Leader Zuheir Mohsen

&gt; The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct ""Palestinian people"" to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan.

Citation: James Dorsey, Wij zijn alleen Palestijn om politieke reden, Trouw, 31 March 1977

With that being the case it is impossible to see Palestinian suicide bombings and rocket attacks as justified actions of an oppressed people.

The event and its humiliation continues to live on for months afterward, further tormenting her.  To any halfway clueful school employee, this outcome should have been obvious.

another illustrative example -- as far as i know Wikipedia has a hord of Apache/PHP server because one server can only server few (3-4) requests per seconds.

analyzing theoretic complexity of the task, assembling page from pieces in database should take at most something like tenth of millisecond, if implemented in optimal way.

Well, seems as if your organization has missed some very basic ideas:

     http://www.whyaretheydead.net/

Deaths in Scientology's Fort Harrison Hotel

Flag is the abbreviation of Flag Land Base, Scientology's presence in Clearwater. The first building they bought was the 272-room Fort Harrison hotel.

&gt;The amount of literacy that is needed to be able to read and apply what is on a basic written page surpasses what many people have at their fingertips.

""Do they speak English in WHAT?!"" ""Oh, oh you were finished?
So, just because I graduated college and have been published doesn't mean that I have the amount of literacy needed to read and apply what is on page?  Is this what you are saying?  I think several people will disagree with your ""line of reasoning...""

Back to why $cientology practices fair gaming

Make your choices wisely.  Is this what the $cientology organization has been doing?  After all LRH didn't want it called fair gaming due to the negative public relations problem it was causing (not to mention all the problems it was causing people who disagreed with you).  If you disagree with me, do I kill your cat, go by your house and threaten you, sue you, lie about you, go to your 1st grade teacher and find all the dirt I can on you?  Little excessive isn't it?  How about a lot excessive - yet the organization of $cientology has done this time and time again.  Notice I said the organization.  I doubt that barring the movie stars, most of the membership hasn't enough money left to hire all the private investigators.

I love how you tried to de-rail the conversation after the part where you quoted me.  Very $cientologist of you.  But please, let's keep to the facts of the matter.  ""Fair Gaming""  

&gt;If you attack us, then do not expect us to lie down meekly.

Well, I'll give you that.  But which $cientologist has been attacked?  Which one has been ""fair gamed"" by people outside the organization of $cientology?  I bet you know many!  [wink]  Not one would be the truth.  You perceive any negative publicity as an attack.  [Sensitive aren't we?]  I don't see the church(s) down the street doing any of that.  I do see the radical cults of Islam practicing this.  Does the actions of $cientology fit that of a radical Islamic cult, those cults that even the imams despise?  You betcha.

&gt;If you want to have a philosophical discussion, fine. If you want to clarify your understanding of what I believe, fine.

Yes I want to know what gives the organization of $cientology the right to infiltrate governments, hurt people in any way they can, and causes the death of their members.  Sounds like a simple list doesn't it?

&gt;If you find it impossible to believe my beliefs are sincere, then you will freak out all the more, as more and more evidence appears that contradicts what you hold dear, because if what you believe is true, then it is impossible for me to have any sincere beliefs.

Have I attacked your beliefs?  No.  Have I questioned the organization to which you have chosen to affiliate yourself with - yes!  The organization of $cientology which chooses to inflict pain and suffering into the lives of others and calls it ""fair game.""  No, I haven't touched your beliefs, I have only questioned the actions of the organization to which you belong.  If you have the evidence, show us.  If not, why do you lie?

You attack - I question.  You deceive - I question.  You need to ask your organization how to proceed.

The only civil union proposal I've heard that makes sense is to make ""marriage"" a purely religious term, remove any mention of it from federal or state law, and make ""civil union"" the legal term.

Maybe you, not me. If you start with the  single ""if"" of a free society you should get at least two things

 * no slaves
 * free markets

Well, there's more, but you can't take that away.

&gt; The willingness of the individual to be a slave or not doesn't matter when they do not possess a means to stop it.

\*shrug\* Any social order which relies on the use of force is not a free-market system.

&gt; In a market-based system, the ability to use force would be to the advantage of those with the most wealth.

You're making the implicit assumption that in a free-market system wealth == force. I don't buy it.

&gt; They would be able to exert their will upon those unable to afford a means to stop them.

That's not how the *free* markets works. That's not how you sell stuff. And should sell stuff, a lot of stuff in order to be wealthy. Coca-Cola is a mega-rich company, but how can Coca-Cola use force to make more profits? Just curious, do you have any scenario ready, or is all that talk, just that? Talk.

&gt; Force would be a market commodity like anything else.

And a pretty useless commodity it will be. Because of a lot of incentives *not to use the force*, and because of such commodities as as protection services and insurance.

Obviously, any car that there isn't much of uses less energy than a car that there are heaping amounts of.  STFW!!! 

Look, assuming that the quantity of cars is pretty much fixed, the question is how to get those cars to be as efficient at possible.

Let me put it another way.  Let's say that incandescent bulbs died out (as they will), and were replaced by compact fluoresecents or even LED bulbs.  Eventually, most of the world's usage would be based on the more efficient lights, and only a few incandescents would be left.  Now, at that point, if you were to total the amount of energy being used by the more efficient lighting, you'd find that incandescents were using less energy, simply because of the sheer numbers involved.  Would you actually argue that we should go back to incandescents at that point?  

If this escapes your tiny mind, do me a favor, and try explaining this to someone else.  You probably won't find a soul that agrees with you, this is so profoundly basic.

The presidency for this go around is essentially screwed, but the movement to restore the US isn't over.

"science","t5_mouw","I used to really respect the BBC but their science reporting is useless especially on emotive issues. Their typically style is ""this person says ...., but this person says the opposite"" with little attempt to put any perspective on who might be talking nonsense. e.g.

| The Catholic Church describes it as ""monstrous"". But medical bodies and patient groups say such research is vital for our understanding of disease.

Why is it ""monstrous""? The second sentence seems to imply that it might actually be ""monstrous"" but the utility of it makes it worth it.

| So what possible justification can scientists offer for doing what the Catholic Church has branded ""experiments of Frankenstein proportion""?

Nice. This implies that there is something that needs justifying.

The Church's comments demonstrate they have no understanding of why hybrids are or what the limits of this bill are. There are no human embryos being killed (it's skin cell DNA!), no mutant babies being grown, no body part farms being made etc. This kind of non-skeptical reporting really fuels the fear mongering fire. When we're talking about a research process for finding cures to horrific diseases this kind of flippant reporting is shameful.

FTA:
So, just how green is a PZEV machine? Well, if you just cut your lawn with a gas mower, congratulations, you just put out more pollution in one hour than these cars do in 2,000 miles of driving. Grill a single juicy burger, and you've cooked up the same hydrocarbon emissions as a three-hour drive in a Ford Focus PZEV. As the California Air Resources Board has noted, the tailpipe emissions of these cars can be cleaner than the outside air in smoggy cities.

Thus, the 30 days isn't just for you to pay the bill once you get it; it's also for you to get the bill in the first place, and for the payment to get to them.

This isn't without consequences. The article doesn't say whether AT&amp;T soiled his credit rating or not, but they could, if he was “late”—and as he mentions, he's “late” from the very minute he takes possession of it (because AT&amp;T's due date is “upon receipt”).","1207080994"

Steven Smith primarily uses Basic for the examples. I dare anyone challenge the man on his incompetence simply because the tool he uses to teach. He states that Basic was chosen to better express the fundamental principles of the algorithms without having the reader engrossed in complexities of a given language.

Understandably in real world scenarios, DSP code is mostly written in C or ASIC-specific assembly (or Fortran if it targets a more general arch.). However, the above is a valid point that every tool is valid, and in the hands of an expert can be used to express the desired result.

Edit: In context of this discussion, valid means Turing-complete. Also, as it should be evident, clearly there are better tools than others. But it really does all boil down to the person wielding the tools.

Yes, I'm an atheist.  But I think it would be folly to say that the being of God 'does not exist'...  As a former Christian, I remember my personal, prayer relationship with Christ very well, and in fact it has survived well into my Atheism with little change.  (""God"" is still there in my mind, he just admits that he's 'merely' the master of my own destiny, not the whole universe's).  Fundamentally, we're 'wired for god'.  This isn't a bad thing, in fact, I wonder if in fact its actually a human sine-qua-non... But either way, those silly little Tautologies you guys love to spout because they make you feel so good: (Love Exists because of God. God is Love. Bible Therefore god Therefore the Bible, etc) Your view on the meaning of those statements is heavily skewed by the emotional response they generate, leading you to think they are far more 'profound' than others, who lack the same emotional reaction, find them.  

The situation is not unlike sexual arousal, actually.  When we are aroused, we say things that sound absolutely ludicrous when we're sober, but in the 'heat of the moment', the energy of the words drives our emotional state to new heights.  Such is the same with ""Religious Wisdom.""  That which sounds 'sexy profound' to a christian can come off as cheesy as a poor-star's moans to those who do not possess the same notion of Truth.

Now, statistically, only 5 of those 100 mortgages of yours are crap, so you're only losing about $500,000. But your bundle of mortgages won't sell for $9.5m, because nobody knows _which_ of those mortgages in the 5%.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;oh, well if wikipedia says it....

No, it if the wikipedia says it. I happen to know this from multiple other sources. If you want to play the game of denying the source then at least find some other source that disagrees. 

&gt;It still doesn't change the fact that arabs are semites,

Actually, to be precise Arabic is a Semitic language. ""Arabs"" are a more diverse group than most people think if you want to discuss either genetics or culture. Pan-Arabism is a political claim and a political movement, not an objective reality. But the major point here is that the term ""anti-Semitism"" has a specific meaning: it was invented to mean hatred of Jews and that is what it means today. This attempt to deny that meaning is a political move to deny the hatred of Jews. 

&gt;If you look at the actual history (which you won't, you'll just keep repeating this same baseless point over and over) you'll notice that historically it has been a prejudice leveled against arabs as well.

I ignore it because it is irrelevant to the discussion. Of course there has been prejudice against Arabs (though more now than in the past, there is also a strong streak of admiration for the Arabs, particularly in Britain). But in the 19th century ""Semite"" meant Jews and the term anti-Semite was made up to refer to hatred of Jews. That there were also other prejudices is simply irrelevant to that point.

&gt;if you haven't noticed there's nothing in either of our posts on the subject that are conditional or contain the phrase ""I think"" or anything, so the fact that you're warping your entire view of history to conform to how your opinion now should be a cause for alarm for you, eventually that always comes back to bite your a**.

I have no idea what your point is. I give you references which you simply ignore and now you make some claim about my warping my view of history, but you have not even bothered to give one example of my doing that.

"programming","t5_2fwo","While I think there is a lot of vitriol and knee-jerk reactions going around on this topic, there seem to be good reasons for it.

First, MS really doesn't have a good track record on being open, so the burden of proof is on them to show they've changed their ways. As I understand (and I freely admit I am more parroting than anything else) they have kept a backdoor open via patents, so the potential for danger is there.

To address your later point about alienating developers, I would refer you to the ""Fire and Motion"" article from Joel Spolsky, who is generally fairly pro-MS. There he talks about how their constant barrage of new products/frameworks/languages etc is not a particularly healthy thing. I have to say, this is one of the things that's been turning me off developing for/with MS. The fun I had with assemblies, and bad/changed standard libs, and link times just added to it, and I want to turn my back on it, and develop with/for something that has a bit longer half/life.

Getting back to OOXML, I think it's great their doing it, but they seem to essentially be using security through obscurity, by making it too complex for anyone else to actually implement. Which may not be voluntary, but it does seem to be a good reason not to use it. Your documents will still be hostage to MS. Of course, this doesn't mean that OOXML can't be a standard, but their seem to be good reasons against it, and lots of ... shenanigans in the various national ISO committees, which certainly doesn't speak well for it.

Whatever. I hope the whole process has made people more aware of the options, and the risks/benefits of different strategies.","1207082534"

You've found a coincidence, congratulations. Like an irrational person, you've decided it's a ""pattern"" and done no furhter research. Had you used the coincidence as a starting point, instead of a end point, you'd find out _exactly_ what the SEC found when they asked the exact same question.

And if you had done the rational thing, you'd know the answer, and you wouldn't be asking such a question.

Truthers see patterns where none exist. This is a perfect example.

As for truely revolutionary thinking, most times that comes from brainstorming with colleagues, not a lone genius. You seem to belong to that dwindling ""19th-century cult of the genius"" that has been thoroughly discredited. Even Einstein and Newton had close antecedents to their discoveries. Einstein didn't even come up with E=mc^2 all by himself.

Your analogy of computer viruses can also be used against your argument. Tailor-made computer viruses have been around a long time now, but have you seen a massive die-off of computers? Are we back in the telegraph age? Hardly. And the human immune system does have a ton of back-ups and adaptive qualities. Even HIV only develops into full-blown AIDS 1/3rd of the time (a little-known fact lost in the AIDS panic).

I am not nearly as optimistic (and hence not as terrified of) biotech as you are. As for whether any rational person could doubt what you're claiming, if so than all trained biologists must also be irrational, since you hardly see a huge outcry from them that synthetic life will doom us all.

I am upset at the thought of human extinction - although it's far more likely to come from a natural source - such as an asteroid or super-volcano - than some tech boogyman. Also ""extinction"" is not the right word. Some humans may survive, but never again make it out of the tribal state. Our culture has already used up a lot of the bootstrap resources they'd need (oil, coal, etc.) before they could jump to solar and nuclear tech. It's civilization that's at risk. Killing off every single human breeding population probably won't happen anytime soon.

There is no ""backtracking"". Here it is, one last time-

1. Social spending can boost the economy during a slowdown.

2. It can boost it  even with spending on otherwise useless things, such as defense systems. 

3. You can even boost it with a war that kills half a million people.

4. Important note before you start ranting again- just because you *can* do that doesn't mean you *should*. By the same token, I can increase my wealth by shooting and robbing you.
5. It is quite possible to understand this and still not want to do it. Understanding this does not make a person ""evil"".

Next up-

""YOU JUST SAID THE MONEY COULD BE BETTER SPENT SO THAT MEANS THE WAR IS BAD"".

The war employs hundreds of thousands of troops and private contractors. Nearly all of them are American and will bring that money home and spend it on goods and services.

That, in and of itself, stimulates the economy. Yes, the money could have been better spent, say, building new roads in minnesota where they're needed. But it doesnt change the stimulus.

This is your queue to go SO YOU SAY WAR IS GOOD FUCK YOU ASSHOLE.

Re-read what I wrote.


There is one sense in which the War is bad for the economy, and that's that Bush is paying for it with money he doesnt have, which weakens the dollar. That's yet another good reason to oppose the war. But if he had done any kind of civic spending on a balanced budget, he could have had one effect without the other.


This is your cue to ignore all that and come back with ""So You think WAR is GOOD your an EVIL asshole and YOUR STUPID so FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOM."" Have at it. I won't bother to reply again.","1207083008"

The OS issues commands to the disk controller, which performs them in [the order it pleases](http://www.seagate.com/content/pdf/whitepaper/D2c_tech_paper_intc-stx_sata_ncq.pdf).  When you're IO bound, you're not stuck waiting to issue commands to the drive - you're stuck waiting for the drive to finish them.  The OS can't somehow push higher-priority IO to the front of the drive's queue.

Read, for example, the relevant bit on Microsoft's Vista IO priority architecture [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/f/7/af7777e5-7dcd-4800-8a0a-b18336565f5b/Priorityio.doc) (warning - Word document):

&gt;...all NCQ drives can claim to support Priority NCQ without actually being required to deliver better quality of service for high-priority I/O. For Priority NCQ to become useful, requirements for processing behavior must be incorporated into the proposal. Those requirements must also include a timeout value and a discardable flag, as described in this paper.

In other words, even the best serial ATA drives don't give you what you need to make IO priority useful.

The best you can do is an honest-to-God throttle, where you actually limit how fast you issue commands to the controller.  This will hurt your throughput in addition to your latency, but at least it works _today_.

Anything that is one step away from these goods, like eggs, will take a big leap. Anything that is labor dependent or local or non-fungible will rise less, like housing or haircuts.  Chinese manufactured goods probably won't do much, because most of the money stays on our shore, and only a small fraction goes to the Chinese factory.","1207083483"

1) ""Semitic"" may be the name of a family of languages, but they do share a proven genetic bond with one another, they both claim common ancestery, and they share this language, that's called an ethnic group, call it what you will, we can call it ""semite""
2) So I'm an anti-semite now just for wanting to include arabs in the definition? that doesn't make any logical sense. There has been a long history of anti-arab sentiment, the anti-jewish just (unfortunately) become the most prevalent. They are common people who experience the same prejudice, it's just the jewish variant became strong in much the rest of europe. I don't include arabs with jews because I hate jews, and it disturbs me that you consider it such an insult to be considered related.
3) What you posted showed that Renan (for example) would have probably considered arabs and jews the same. 
4) My sources can be nothing more than history and the fact that the sources cited in the wikipedia article are invalid since the guy refuses to acknowledge common ancestory.
5) My point is that while a lot of Palestinians have an irrational hatred of Jews in general, that the zionist response has been to treat Palestinian anti-zionism as just more anti-semiticism so they don't have to address the issue.","1207083808"

jedi hibernation trance.


Hibernation Trance - allows a Jedi to place himself into a deep trance which slows all body functions: the Jedi's heartbeat slows, their breathing drops to barely-perceivable levels, and they enter a state of unconsciousness. Although able to heal in a hibernation trance, most Jedi use this power as a matter of survival; if food or air supplies are low, a Jedi entering into a hibernation trance is able to survive for many weeks. It also gives the Jedi an ability to ""play dead,"" which can often times be advantageous in certain missions. Similar to the meditative trance, a Jedi is abruptly awoken from the hibernation trance if an immediate danger is sensed nearby. ","1207083930"

&gt; as far as i know Wikipedia has a hord of Apache/PHP server because one server can only server few (3-4) requests per seconds.

You've got to multiply your figure by ten at least, see: [1](http://highscalability.com/wikimedia-architecture) [2](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Wikimedia-servers-2006-05-09.svg).

That's about 105 Apache+PHP servers serving 17% (not proxied) of 30.000 requests/sec peak equaling at least 50 requests/second per server.

&gt; thus, implementing stuff in proper way, they could replace enormous horde of hundreds of servers with just a few of them.

My bet is that they would be replaced by an enormous horde of programmers.

A: Lived in a war zone.

B: Knew the rarest of all children. The rare evil genius who knew that binding and slashing a victim as well as numbers to make up for a small size of the individual would be essential.

C: Are young enough violence was part of the television culture at the time.

Since this was AK, and WA. We can rule war zone out. Keep in mind, I'm not talking about what you seem to be. A child talking about something they probably don't understand. I am talking about children who knew that duct tape, handcuffs, a knife, and a heavy blunt object, hiding the evidence from the police, as well as sheer numbers, were all going to be key parts of the plan to murder someone. Then executed the plan to near fruition.

Pretending that sitting on a couch while mom watched CSI didn't probably contribute to this is ignoring the issue. Ignoring it doesn't fix it. Talking to children openly and honestly about things they are exposed to things that children in America, England, and France 80 years had no concept of fixes it. Raising a kid that knows what he sees on TV is not always acceptable or real, and discussing this with them, as opposed to using it as a babysitter fixes it.

You'd like to think so. It would certainly be very CONVENIENT for you. The truth is that all the easy pickings are gone and substantial new discoveries involve massive systems that need hundreds or thousands of researchers to go through. But if you know anything about programming, especially the part about good programmers being orders of magnitude better than the bad programmers, then you ought to know better than to claim that geniuses don't exist. Just because the conditions for casual observation no longer exist doesn't mean that a species is extinct, nevermind the notino that it never existed in the first place.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;the realtor doesn't have to disclose squat.

The seller has to disclose. And if the realtor has given advice, which is a question here, then the realtor can be liable for that advice.

&gt;Disclosing that is the equivalent of disclosing the fact that there are gays, african americans, latinos, or any other race or social status living nearby.

Nope. Look up the term ""[protected class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class)"". Under the various Civil Rights laws skin color, ethnic background, and age are protected classes. The realtor is prohibited from discriminating on that basis. The issue here, however, is action. The neighbor **does things**. Actions do not a protected class make. 

&gt;As a Realtor (and I am one), I would never even think about disclosing something like that, simply because it does not materially affect the value of the property. Hence, it does not have to be disclosed.

Race, etc. not only does not have to be disclosed, it is discriminatory to disclose it. Abusive behavior does materially affect the value and does have to be disclosed.

1.  I live in Reno, NV, which is still a pretty conservative place.  When I was growing up, it was Moral Majority Central.  We used to have the Gay Rodeo here until the early 80s when the holy rollers got together and got the county commissioners to stop letting them use the fairgrounds (this was back when they still had the *real* majority hornswoggled into thinking all homos are child molesters, and that the gays were coming to town for their children).  There are still a lot of them here, and there are a LOT of Jesus fish around.  I like to remind them that while they may be the majority, they do not have a complete monopoly. 


2.  It also signals to my fellow unbelievers that they're not alone - who knows, it may even help me get a date one of these days.  Also, I grew up gay, and ""Jesus hates you"" was pretty much the message that I inculcated from Christianity.  So do I have a chip on my shoulder against the religion and its adherents?  Ya, you betcha.


3. I like the ""Evolve"" fish better than the Darwin fish, because I think it says, WTF are people still doing talking about whether or not evolution is true, when having that discussion is like asking whether the Earth is flat.  Let's move on - let's keep evolving, pick up a tool and build something.

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language)

&gt; Dynamic programming language is a term used broadly in computer science to describe a class of high level programming languages that execute at runtime many common behaviors that other languages might perform during compilation, if at all. These behaviors could include extension of the program, by adding new code, by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system, all during program execution. These behaviors can be emulated in nearly any language of sufficient complexity, but dynamic languages provide direct tools to make use of them.

http://www.nrel.gov/vehiclesandfuels/npbf/pubs_biodiesel.html

What really got me, even then, was in ""Business Management for Biodiesel Producers"". It pointed out that even if all oil crops in the US were converted to diesel, we'd still only get 10% of our current use of highway diesel (in 2004, I guess). That's a drop in the bucket. Just *diesel*, not even including regular gasoline.

In all this time, since we started doing biofuels in the 70s, nobody's managed to make them energy positive, past the basic fryer oil reuse, in which the original production costs of the oil can be ignored. Now that we have *mandates* to use these fuels, it no longer matters whether they're energy positive, because this has been sold to enough local governments (and individuals) to support an industry.

If on the otherhand you are selective, you get a few great supportive friends, they get other friends likeminded. You now have expanded your circle of supportive friends so now those are your only friends. This can't be done if you're cynical and overly negative(or overly positive). If you want to be interesting, be interested in others. So in this way, you have attracted those friends to you, it is just a different way at looking at it, there's nothing magical about it. People slap the spirituality label on it, some have packaged it up and sold it, it's just a label for what has worked for thousands of years. Some called it the 'golden rule', others talk about it in their religious books. Zoroastrians said it bluntly thousands of years ago when they said you are your thoughts. It's truth, some apply it to businesses, others their personal lives. This article is just an application of that truth. It isn't a secret, it's been out there for most of recorded history.

I disagree with your perception of a ""straw man"" argument. You really did use language that is frequently used in a derogatory manner, and especially when joined with a negative, sarcastic comment, it's hard to see it in a different light. That said, I'll take your word for it that you did not intend offense.

Interesting and equally unfortunate, therefore, that you choose to declare an intention to offend me in your response. While you maintain that ""immaturity"" does not benefit reddit, you engage in it yourself, and are even aware of it.

Regarding your charge of ""blatant and laughable hypocrisy"", I maintain that the two are different; although I understand your point, I disagree with it. I downvote most RickRolls, and that is also your right (and some would argue responsibility) as a member of the reddit community. Account bans, though, are draconian and entirely unnecessary, thus my original response.

To clarify: My original comment reflected what I saw to be an unnecessarily harsh proposed punishment for a relatively minor problem. I do genuinely see value in well-executed rickrolls, thus my second comment, although I agree that most are long past any originality.

Finally, if you wish to continue this discussion, I would hope that you would do it without sinking to what you yourself deem childish. Respectful dialogue is a good thing on reddit, but that means choosing one's words carefully and giving the benefit of the doubt.","1207085555"

This is a strategy whereby the State has control of all key resource-producing industries and manages most aspects of the market, in contrast to laissez faire capitalism.  Though to be fair, this definition is more true of Leninism, and the term socialism does entail multiple different branches.

A Nazi is a member of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, commonly called the NSDAP or Nazi Party).  The Nazi's, of course, promised to restore social order and fix a failing system, so long as they could get rid of the boogey-man of their time.  Then it was the jews, our new boogey-man is the terrorist.  Except now, the Nazi's aren't limited to just one political school of thought, and the Jews are helping them (well, primarily the zionists, but that's a different battle for a different time)

"politics","t5_2cneq","The voucher program has been expanding. Ergo, the average kid in the program hasn't been in it for long. If the ""test"" group were restricted to kids who had been in voucher schools for many years it might be reasonable to conclude something about the relative performance of the two groups by comparing the test scores of the ""test"" and control groups at the start of this study. But it wasn't, so it isn't.

So when you say they ""called a halt"" to studies, you just meant they stopped mandating yearly reports from the voucher schools and left it up to others to do the studies. Fine.

&gt;Milwaukee has had this voucher program almost 20 years now. If the voucher kids were going to surpass the other kids by high school, wouldn't they have done it by now?

Gee, I'm glad you asked that.  as it turns out,  [they did](http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/01/30/21voucher.h27.html). The kids that took vouchers in lower school are more likely to graduate high school than the kids that didn't. 

(You need a study like the current one to determine whether that trend is robust when controlling for SES, so we'll start to know in 2012 or so whether it is, when they can compare these carefully-matched similar test and control groups and see whether *they* diverge over the next several years in performance.)","1207086315"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Mind you, I have no conception or belief that I am deceiving you. 

And your own logic is such that IF I do not agree with you, it automatically proves your point, as far as your own thoughts go.

You have become convinced that I cannot be a sincere Scientologist, because if I was rational, in your eyes, I would *have* to agree with you.

I guess we should write off the pranking of obscene faxes, telephone calls, etc. in past months.

Or the apparent attempt last month of some anonymous to barge into a church to disrupt proceedings.

You confuse the practices of the corrupt who went to jail, and You confuse the people were cast out with the people who cast them out.

Sort of like laying to guilt on you for something your parents or grand parents did.

Or shall we make you personally responsible for all of the injustices of the America Civil war? There are plenty of folks still looking for their 40 acres and a mule.

[Of course, making you personally responsible cannot not be seriously proposed]

*So, just because I graduated college and have been published doesn't mean that I have the amount of literacy needed to read and apply what is on page? Is this what you are saying? I think several people will disagree with your ""line of reasoning...""*

Now You interpreted this as a personal attack, it seems. Not So.

As far as your confusion about the literacy levels, this tells me that you have not really worked in tech support. I suggest this technology site to read up on how painfully lacking some people are when it comes to reading directions, etc.

http://rinkworks.com/stupid/

And it is amazing what hemming and hawing you get when you ask the average joe blow what any individual word on a page means.

....

The Lisa McPherson Case is a suckass poor case to use as an example, because the Florida State Coroner Joan Wood apparently screwed up the autopsy, and had to revise it to exonerate the church based on Scientific evidence, and testified to such under oath in open court.

The prosecutor was politically ambitious, and was royally pissed when the cased did not turn out as planned. I am sure he had dreams of running for Governor some day, but it didn't quite pan out.

The coroner turns out, had messed up other autopsies, and 150+ had to be reviewed. And she eventually quit in massive disgrace.

Millionaire Bob Minton, who had originally financed the Lisa McPherson trust, pulled out and switched sides for a variety of reasons, including the fact that the Lawyers he was paying to sue the church were trying to screw him out of even more money.

All of this is in the free online Archive of the Saint Pete Times. Known locally as the SP times for their hostility towards the local church. 

Now we have someone who repeats the original charges and conveniently leaves off the material that killed the case. But you recommend we tolerate this with a cheerful smile. Gee, How convenient.

...

As a particular point, the policy on Fair Game was abolished decades ago. 

The policy on the need to keep the BS down regarding people being hostile has not changed. The other notes as seen in an earlier comment in this thread still apply. If you want to be mean to us, we are under no obligation to help you be mean to us. 

In the materials not usually quoted, but quite available and publicly published, a note is made of how an individual Scientologist can screw things up with family, friends, etc. Paraphrasing, the rule here is don't be stupid, don't make things worse, etc. Beside, waving some notion of superiority in someone's face is just bad manners, and makes you about as welcome as a skunk at a tea party.

More Regarding the Fair Game allegations.

There is a reason why modern justice systems use proof of guilt vs proof of innocence as a basis 

It is very difficult to win any case on the basis of proving innocence. So you accuse someone of killing pets. No proof of guilt, but based on various circumstances. Now to prove innocence.

Example: Imagine if you had gone to a European or Russian porn site. No big deal, right? There are probably photos of people there who are of the age of majority in their own countries, an age which is less than that in the USA. If you were in the USA, you could be hit for child pornography. Very touchy, long jail terms, etc. So let's say that you make a rule never to visit European porn sites. all for the good. Once the allegation was made, could any one prove that they had never ever visited a site with child porn. Don't even mention USENet. You see it would be very difficult on a personal level. And a totally unfair accusation.

Now, we shift this to an organization. Even if totally true, the difficulty of proving innocence beyond a reasonable doubt that such a thing never happened multiplies itself.

This can be instantly taken as proof of guilt, which it is not.

The UFO community flips it around this way, to argue for UFOs:

The Absence of Evidence is not Evidence of Absence. (a slightly flawed argument, BTW, via Occam's razor)

....
    
If you find it impossible to believe my beliefs are sincere, then you will freak out all the more, as more and more evidence appears that contradicts what you hold dear, because if what you believe is true, then it is impossible for me to have any sincere beliefs.

..

Have I attacked your beliefs?
---
The question of have you attacked My beliefs is not very sequitor with the comments made before, which were going along the basis of what were axioms in your thought structure for the basis of this conversation.

...

Part of the problem comes down to this. 

IF a Scientologist has had successful auditing, and IF a Scientologist has had substantial personal benefit from this, and if because of this they find themselves to be a much more kind and loving and positive and capable person ....

To the degree that this happens, the more inconceivable the accusations become. Quite simply, such personal experiences put a lie to such accusations. 

As an example of this, take a look at what graduate of the Narconon program say regarding their changed lives on the COS video channel mentioned earlier. These aren't my words. They are totally convinced and certain about their changed condition for the better.

And I could understand why they would want to pummel anyone who would disparage what they achieved, or the methods used to achieve it, despite being a bit better off than they were before 

And Critics would gleefully point, saying *SEE! SEE!, they are attacking us!*

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;The entire scientific method was developed precisely because humans pattern seeing abilities aren't so good.

Actually, you're wrong. The human brain has *amazing* pattern recognition ability. The problem is that sometimes it can see a pattern where there is none or fail to recognize a pattern because it's too subtle. 

Humans, by the way, invented the scientific method, not ""God"" so you'd do well not to imply that the scientific method is any way perfect or that it somehow perfects humanity. It does not. It simply gives humans another tool to use. If humans are flawed so is the scientific method.

The most damning evidence against your claim that humans can't recognize patterns: **captchas**

&gt;You've found a coincidence, congratulations. 

No, I found a flaw in your argument and then you got all defensive. My pattern recognition ability has seen this behavior before.

For the record I read about the insider trading on 9/11 years ago and have already done considerable research on the subject (9/11) as a whole. Info on the insider trading issue is hard to come by so I haven't reached any solid conclusions on it, but it certainly aroused my suspicions.

&gt;Had you used the coincidence as a starting point, instead of a end point, you'd find out exactly what the SEC found when they asked the exact same question.

That's not an argument, that's an appeal to authority, which is a fallacy of course.

&gt;Truthers see patterns where none exist.

"politics","t5_2cneq","One issue is some Ron Paul's supporters do not believe enough in themselves and the impact of their message to expend the extra effort it takes to win. I participated in my state's Republican delegation process, first at the precinct level, then at the senatorial district convention, and soon the state convention level. Of the two Ron Paul supporters in our precinct who registered with the campaign, one could not get off of work the night of the precinct convention, and one simply didn't want to get involved.

Since we were new to this process, we didn't know we could elect by proxy the supporter who had to work. With some more advance planning, we could have added an additional 40% more delegates with Ron Paul supporters. In our senatorial district, the Ron Paul supporters lost a key motion on the floor by literally a handful of delegates because they signed a petition and then left for the day.

Ron Paul supporters can claim dirty tricks by the RNC all they want, but we just entered this game and most of these RNC players have literally seen a dozen election cycles come and go. And until I see liberty caucus-like supporters show up in sufficient numbers to really sway all the conventions from the grassroots precinct level on up, I remain unconvinced that we're doing everything we can within the system to effectively carry the message out.

It's a marathon folks, not a sprint. We need to do this again for at least another 3-4 election cycles (3-4 times, every two years) before we can expect national-level victory. Victories like Alaska show we're on the right track.","1207087398"

I'm 100% done with Wal*Mart and I hope the lawyers choke on all the money they made on this case (which is probably way more than $277k).  Unfuckingbelievable.

The client would be very simple and built into OS distributions like Vista and Ubuntu ... it merely logs into a chosen number of public-sector servers (for example, if I live in West Hollywood, I would set my OS up to check  West Hollywood, Los Angeles County and Southern California) and checks for alerts.

The only people with permission to submit alerts would be emergency response organizations.

The reason I thought of this, is that increasingly I am not exposed to ""traditional"" media like television and radio  that could be used to get the word out.

I'm sure wikipedia is right about the income tax. Just add the Swedish 25% sales tax to the equation. You might find this article interesting: http://stefanmikarlsson.blogspot.com/2008/03/sweden-no-longer-highest-taxed-country.html

Luckily my income is not dependant on local wages, but rather on international sales. Still, New Zealand does remarkably well given the circumstances. It can certainly do better though.


""I used to live with a Swedish guy in London - he was in the middle of a music degree and was in london as part of some sort of work experience - the following year he went to drum-tech in LA... and this was provided for by the state. I daresay he's now paying taxes so someone else can have a similar level of freedom - and is probably happy to do so.""

This argument is both highly anecdotal and fails logicly. 
Unfortunately Sweden has 10 lazy full time wow playing students for each ambitious student. 

It's not like the government is the only way because of one case. Take the argument to the extreme, with 100% taxes, a system like that would prove that having  things like this being government funded is the only solution as it can't be done any other way, right? An ambitious and talented student shouldnt  have trouble getting a loan, especially  not  in a  free economy that  functions well.

The money he used up was also taken from some other productive activity (maybe a small internet business, making it hire one employee less, and making the company and the economy as a whole less efficient), not from a rich kid.

I say this not because I know it but because I know Gore's history and know that hes had a much stronger belief in the rule of law and the Constitution than Bush does. So he would not have moved to undermine both so recklessly. Yes there are assumptions involved. The financial situation may or may not have been worse, but you can be rest assured the infringements on our rights and our Constitution would not have taken place. To equate all candidates is a mistake. One that shows a complete lack of Historical context. Just looking at a comparison of the rich-poor gap or the federal deficit on a party basis and leaving out the candidates is a revelation. The differences don't address all of the issues you feel strongly about, but that doesn't make them irrelevant.

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt;edit: are you implying that the average japanese taxpayer came out on top with subsidies to a company? 

I'm not implying it, I'm outright saying it. Haven't you heard of Japan, inc? That's how they do.

The Prius may not account for all of Toyota's sales, but its been a huge money-maker for them, and its an important expanding market. Its one of the reasons theyre seeing such success, and why they have to open huge new plants in my rural area of Japan. That economic expansion is creating tons of new jobs here. So its hard to feel bitter about the use of taxpayer money. 

The US government/industry is corrupt and filled with corporate welfare, and people surmise that ALL government cooperation is intrinsically bad.

But there's a world of difference. The US guv gives corps massive tax breaks and asks nothing in return, and throws billions at companies when they tank, no strings attached.

In this case, the Japanese government gave subsidies in various forms for hard research and development. R&amp;D in green technology constitutes real, genuine investments in both the environment and emerging markets, not just brainless, wasteful corporate payola.

And rather than responding by shutting even more plants and ungratefully shipping even more jobs overseas, Toyota made even more jobs right here in Japan. Thats planning done right.","1207089105"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Awe for nature. Yeah, it bugs me greatly that environmentalism (a corollary of awe/interest in nature) took so long to get traction within the church. It also took me some time to appreciate (through reading Douglas Adams) the philosophy behind atheist appreciation for nature (his was, if I'm not distorting, that the marvelous results of evolutionary process deserve preserving for being marvelous, even if they are no longer competitive in pure survival terms). 

In a related sphere, the nature of beauty is an interesting one. Science can measure what people find beautiful, and propose mechanistic explanations for the sensation of beauty, but in what capacity can it say that beauty is a good thing? Or that anything is good. 

Supernatural. By supernatural I meant non-material, not merely unknown. A realm of existence not part of the atomic structure, but a realm that we may still be connected to. Crudely put, a spirit realm. As such, the only instruments for determining the existence of such a realm would be people (unless animal were also connected to it). Of the top of my head though, I can't think of a reason Occam's razor doesn't defeat this.

Intelligent Design. To be honest, I haven't followed the discussion on this too much. But  one thing I found interesting was people like Stephen Jay Gould's emphasis on methods are than natural selection, and the need for something to explain the Pre-Cambrian explosion. There may be more to the evolutionary development than the two-pronged natural selection + mutation. Although I think it could still be a passive intelligence, another law or mechanism. 

The intelligent design I'm most interested in is the one promoted by a mathematician (I can't remember who): you know something is right when its beautiful. Ie, the symmetry and beauty of the mathematical framework of the universe suggests something more than chance in its construct. ","1207089371"

Uh, no.  My own thoughts are: “you have the right to dance outside in the rain and sing rap” for all I care.  That does not concern me.  What concerns me is the actions of the organization to which you choose to affiliate yourself with.

&gt;You have become convinced that I cannot be a sincere Scientologist, because if I was rational, in your eyes, I would have to agree with you.

No.  No where have I questioned your sincerity.  Think it is stupid, but you are sincere.

&gt;I guess we should write off the pranking of obscene faxes, telephone calls, etc. in past months.

&gt;Or the apparent attempt last month of some anonymous to barge into a church to disrupt proceedings.

You have obviously mistaken me for part of that group.  Since I question your organization then I must be part of Anonymous?   Bad logic Spock…

&gt;You confuse the practices of the corrupt who went to jail, and You confuse the people were cast out with the people who cast them out.

Then why are they still members?  Why do they still continue to practice “fair gaming?”  Why is the organization you belong still run by these types of people?  I think I would be trying to remove them from their offices – but you are a member and can make that choice, I can’t.

&gt;Or shall we make you personally responsible for all of the injustices of the America Civil war? There are plenty of folks still looking for their 40 acres and a mule.

We’re talking about the organizations use of “fair gaming,” not the civil war.  Please try hard to stay on topic.  [Excellent try to move the discussion away from the topic.  Very $cientology of you!  {applause}]

&gt;&gt;So, just because I graduated college and have been published doesn't mean that I have the amount of literacy needed to read and apply what is on page? Is this what you are saying? I think several people will disagree with your ""line of reasoning...""

&gt;Now You interpreted this as a personal attack, it seems. Not So

No, just pointed out that your logic was flawed.  Though that you would appreciate the way in which it was done.  But just for you – Your logic is flawed.  Try again.

&gt;”…how painfully lacking some people are when it comes to reading directions, …”

You just applied that to all people in your previous argument.  Again, flaw in your logic.

I am not going to repost what you said about the deaths.  Please refer to it in his/her above post.

They didn’t die while under the care of $cientology organization did they?  Whoa, they did!  SP times?  What’s wrong – can’t stand any negative publicity?  Wow.  What a “thin-skinned” organization $cientology must be.  I could pull up more web sites but the organization of $cientology would just _try_ to blow them off as well.  Brainwashing must be interesting – but I have no desire to try it out!  Oh, and why did $cientology counter sue the Lisa McPherson trust?

Fair game abolished decades ago?  News to many.  Then why does the organization of $cientology still practice it, but not in name?  Interesting.  I wonder if $cientology realizes they are still doing it?

Quoted from the memo in question:

&gt;Suppressive Acts are clearly those covert or overt acts knowingly calculated to reduce or destroy the influence or activities of Scientology or prevent case gains or continued Scientology success and activity on the part of a Scientologist. As persons or groups that would do such a thing act out of self interest only to the detriment of all others, they cannot be granted the rights and beingness ordinarily accorded rational beings and so place themselves beyond any consideration for their feelings or well being.

That last sentence places all people who disagree with the organization of $cientology in a common group to be “fair gamed.”  But I know, the organization called $cientology really didn’t mean it that way.  
Just look how they act now!

Oh, did I say killing animals?  Sorry.  
Please substitute families, people, dreams, etc in place of animals.  $cientology does that and much more.  Narcon, Volunteer Ministers [and I do use that term loosely], etc is nothing more than a way to promote the organization of $cientology.  These “VM’s” find their way on the scene of a disaster and cause more problems than they fix!  Stand back and let trained professionals hand this.  But then I digress.

The organization of $cientology greatest vulnerability, it would seem, on the public policy question. It does not contribute to the general community interest, as it is entirely self-interested. Even where Scientology demonstrates a charitable side, such as where Volunteer Ministers appear at disaster sites such as Katrina and 9/11, its internal correspondence reveals its true purpose as PR-related. Scientology also maintains practices such as disconnection and fair game (of both ex-members and critics), which are contrary to US public policy, and harm the general community interest.

Obviously, there are many other reasons why Scientology's practices (not beliefs) fail to serve the general community interest or run contrary to public policy. 

&gt;The question of have you attacked My beliefs is not very sequitor with the comments made before, which were going along the basis of what were axioms in your thought structure for the basis of this conversation.

I could throw out large words but let me be brief and clear - $cientology as an organization does illegal and unethical things in the name of protecting itself.  I care not what you believe but rather how the organization of $cientology acts.  When it is harmful to people – internal or external of the organization, sets itself above the laws of the land, it should expect its actions to be called in question.  That is what I am doing regardless of your persecution complex that you exhibit.

&gt;Part of the problem comes down to this.

The actions of the organization called $cientology.  

That is my point.  What is yours?

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I feel like there's a prevailing sort of attitude that hearkens to the time when gaming was considered a habit only for nerds but now it revolves specifically around PC gamers.  Gaming on the most popular games on the most popular consoles is socially acceptable:  but going anywhere beyond what's socially acceptable goes straight into nerd territory.  You are not allowed to enjoy Puzzle Quest unless you're a nerd.  That's just kinda how it works according to popular prejudices.

Jock-type gamers often look down on PC gaming hobbyists in an anti-intellectual manner.  

They constantly say that PC gaming is going to die out because it's perceived to be nerdy and costly and weak.  

The only thing that makes it costly is the effort that has to be put into it. But the games with the most depth, in terms of gameplay, graphics, and immersive experiences, are on the PC.  PC gaming has a dedicated following that will never die so long as good games keep being created, and it has been demonstrated by WoW that pushing polys is not as important as pushing gameplay with addictive properties.

Profits are socialized as well.  They're not spread among only one hardware manufacturer.  Anyone who manufactures quality performance parts will acquire a following.  It's cheap as hell to make pretty much everything from a profitability standpoint.  And it only gets cheaper.  

It's kinda cool and yet kinda crappy that Microsoft uses PowerPC processors.  They probably get such a cheap deal on them from IBM because Apple no longer wants them.  If they keep getting a cheap deal, they'll be using them still when Xbox 1080 comes out.  It's also a hell of a way to DRM the console without making it too complicated to work on (like the PS3, where the Unreal Engine is basically your only option for a cheap development environment...).  Anyone who emulates a 360 is going to need to emulate the proprietary architecture and instruction set.  Same goes for the PS3, only worse.  Regular processors would have to emulate the multitasking ability of several cores that they don't have; working simultaneously.  What a pain in the ass.

Then again, I thought no one would ever be able to emulate a PS2 when I first read about the emotion engine... and yet [lo and behold.](http://www.pcsx2.net/)  The value in PC gaming increases with every generation due to adding backwards compatibility with [every console from the previous generation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NullDC)  Not just the one from the manufacturer's previous cycle.","1207089495"
"reddit.com","t5_6","My sister happens to be right in the middle of this British Airways luggage debacle.  After helping her with trying to get her luggage back let me tell you why you should NEVER EVER fly British Airways.


(My little sister flew from the US to London on British Airways a week or so back).


When we called the British Airways luggage lost customer service line we were immediately put on hold for 20 minutes.  Then when we had the good grace to talk to a human, it was an extremely stupid one.  They told us that her luggage was at Heathrow airport being sorted, and that by tomorrow at 4:30pm they would deliver her luggage to my sister's hostel in London.


Um..try again, her luggage never arrived and she was forced to pay for another night at the hostel.  So once again we called British Airways about the luggage and they said whoops, our mistake the luggage will come the next day by 4:30pm.  We should've known it was a setup by this incompetent airline.


Um..yeah, tricked and lied to again.  Luggage didn't come again and she was forced, once again, to put up in that same hostel.  This time forfeiting her train ticket to Italy to wait for the luggage.  Which of course we have no idea if British Airways is ever going to pay compensate her for.  Yeah, how about a call, or an update, or any news on where her missing luggage is.


Guess what..the luggage didn't come again.  So again we called the British Airways asking for a supervisor, who preceded to tell us to check the Website for the most recent updates on her luggage.  Yeah, dipcrap that would only work if the website was even remotely up to date.  Hmm..it's March 31st and your website was last updated on March 27th.  Seriously, who gave this guy a supervisor role anyway.


So this time we called back right afterwards, and at least this person had the decency to just tell us the truth.  I quote, ""We have no idea where your luggage is"", end quote.  That's right, NO IDEA.  That's how one of the major airlines in the world deals with lost luggage.  Let me paraphrase ""You are SOL, thanks for flying see you later.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I upvoted you for the sources, but the treatment isn't any better or worse than how Chinese treat their own citizens.  China has over 50 ethnic minorities and they all are treated pretty much equally.

People are forcibly transplanted for all large construction projects (after all, in a Communist/Fascist government - the needs of the many outweigh the rights of individuals) - such as the Three Gorges Dam project.  Do you know how many temples, historical sites, villages were drowned for that project?

If China wanted to eradicate the Tibetans (or any minority group), they could have done it with childish ease.  The very fact that minorities are ""protected groups"" and are treated many times better than how the Canadian, US, and Australian governments treat their aboriginal peoples populations.  How come there are no boycotts and public outcry because the Cree or Chippewa are suffering from cultural genocide and forced to study in English?

China does have a repressive fascist government with a multitude of problems, but at least they treat people equally.  It doesn't excuse violations of human rights or free speech, but ""let those without sin"" boycott the Olympics.","1207089584"

If someone is kicking in the door of your home, or raping your wife, or standing over your kid with a knife, put him down. Take him out with your bare hands if necessary. But if the crime has been committed, you can't make it not have happened by hurting him.

The concept of defense does not extend to hunting somebody down after the fact and causing them pain. That is revenge.

&gt;Granted, jumping the gun and beating up an innocent man is wrong, but what if you KNEW the guy had done it?

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Ergo, the average kid in the program hasn't been in it for long

Really? You got statistical information on how long the kids have been participating in the 20 year old program?

Tell me, so we can all evaluate it, what are the mean, median, mode and standard distribution? How does length of time in the voucher program correlate with academic achievement? 

My guess is, you don't know, because you're just wishing aloud that the kids haven't been in the program long, and you don't have one mathematical thing to back it up.

&gt;So when you say they ""called a halt"" to studies, you just meant they stopped mandating yearly reports from the voucher schools and left it up to others to do the studies. Fine.

Yes, they called a halt to the studies they were doing, and quit requiring the voucher schools to provide any data that could be compared to public school students' progress.

I was pretty clear on that point.

You raise a good point though, certainly if the voucher schools had **wanted** to be studied additional years, they could have continue to provide measurable comparison data. But the voucher schools refused to have their students' performance measured head-to-head with the public school students' once it was no longer required by law. 

Wonder why that was?

&gt;The kids that took vouchers in lower school are more likely to graduate high school than the kids that didn't.

Oh dear, do you confuse graduating high school (academic attainment) with academic performance aka achievement? Do you honestly believe that a ""higher graduation rate"" = ""superior academic performance""?

No wonder you keep insisting that the study's authors didn't say what they did. This explains why you keep trying to claim that the **educational reality** doesn't exist.

**Of course the voucher kids graduate more--they are held to a much lower standard!**

They can graduate whether they know the material or not. This study made it clear that the voucher kids are awarded better grades for the same performance. Nor do they have to take the NCLB high stakes exit exams.  Comparing graduation rates taken under different standards without any consistent measure of performance is meaningless in determining achievement.

Parsley lied, and in a very specific way. He claimed that the KKK would support the pro-choice movement, when the KKK has publicly come out supporting Parsley's position instead.

My position is that confronting a liar with his lies is not a cheap shot.

&gt;The pro-choice movement's roots are neonazis

Oh dear, been reading those historically inaccurate right wing blogs again have you?

The anti-choice movement (except in the Catholic Church) was borne on racism. When Roe v. Wade was handed down, the Southern Baptist Convention put out a statement *praising* the decision. But when SBC preachers started losing their tax exemptions for their all white schools (Bob Jones U, Jerry Falwell's place), they decided to seize on an issue to punish America for integration. Eventually, they seized on abortion. Before the loss of the tax exemption for institutionalized racism, the Catholic Church had despaired of ever getting American fundamentalists to oppose abortion.

The fundies did it only because they needed a new serving class, and women were it.

My last ALchemy release (1.00.08) was complately unlocked and could be used with any sound device from any vendor.

I think that Creative approached this situation the wrong way; _no_ I'm not saying ""zmg! hire daniel_k"", but they could have avoided triggering so much nerd rage.  Having said that, they couldn't just sit around with their thumbs up their asses while some guy makes this possible, with their software, on hardware other than their own.

This is unfortunately is a PR nightmare for Creative not only because of how they handled the situation but because people don't seem to be able to see the line between fixing drivers and unlocking features to be used on any soundcard (or that isn't right to do).

$gameCompany isn't going to go trigger a PR shitstorm if they tell someone who is releasing no-cd cracks for their games ""hey, cut that shit out"", but if that person had just finished making that game Vista compatible its a different story.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Putting a label of diaspora politics and dismissing anyone who disagrees with you isn't right either.

I'm not dismissing people that disagree with me, but rather understanding that many involved in this (such as diaspora Arabs, diaspora Palestinians and diaspora Jews) are more biased observers than the non-partisan human rights organizations.

&gt; And saying thats just what happens put you on the same page as the inevitable people who reply to these articles saying someone will call them an anti-semite before anybody does.

I didn't say you were just an example of diaspora politics, but rather how people become ""controversial"" in this issue.  I guess I have read postings on the CAMERA website a few too many times.  If you do that, and you aren't a knee jerk blind defender of Israel, it can make you pretty cynical.

&gt; Its interesting you linked a site you understand to be a holocaust denial site, but for diaspora politics you linked wikipedia. Neglecting the entire article on the controversies surrounding the HRW on wiki.

I am aware of the HRW article on Wikipedia, in fact I've edited it.  I linked to an essay published in the NY Review of Books, a magazine I used to subscribe too, but you couldn't read the article thus I did a search for its title in Google and out popped the PDF on VHO.org.  I guess violating copyright law goes hand in hand with Holocaust Denial these days.

&gt; The controversy article about HRW on wiki turned out to be interesting. I still don't know if I would call them a reputable organization, but they seem to have credibility.

I personally have donated money to HRW (and AI and JfJP and ICAHD.)

&gt; The article says Bedouins live in horrible tents surrounded by rubble. I've lived with the Bedouins and its not bad at all, and the food was great. Read the wiki entry on the Negev Bedouins for more information. Yes, there have been serious misdeads in the past, but it looks like things are good now.

I did read the Wikipedia article.  Did you miss this large section of it...:

&gt; After the establishment of Israel, the Bedouin almost completely ceased to move around with their herds, as a result of the state confiscating their lands.[2] Under Israeli administration, the Bedouin are mostly confined to the northeast corner of the Negev, called the ""Siyaj"". As a consequence, many Bedouin men emigrated to the newly established Jewish farms in the Negev in search of employment. However, they were not allowed to bring their families with them.

&gt; Half the Bedouin population lives in cities. Bedouin settlements are amongst the most deprived in Israel, and are severely lacking in services such as public transport and banks. The rest of the 76,000 continue to live in tens of ""unrecognized villages,"" some of which predate the existence of Israel.[9] Many of these villages were created in the 1950's when the Israeli army resettled Bedouin from the Sinai desert. These villages do not appear on any Israeli maps, and are denied basic services like water, electricity and schools. It is forbidden by the Israeli authorities for the residents of these villages to build permanent structures, though many do, risking fines and home demolition.[9] Several, including Wadi al-Na'am, are located close to the Ramat Hovav toxic waste dump, and residents have suffered from higher than average incidences of respiratory illnesses and cancer.[13] The Israeli government frequently demolishes homes and sprays toxic pesticides onto crops in the unrecognized villages, including one episode where Bedouin homes were demolished to make way for the establishment of a Jewish town.[14] The latter demolition was the beginning of the implementation of ""Blueprint Negev"".","1207090698"

Then you're not voting because a) you're bitter that your candidate is already out b) a non-U.S. resident, or unbelievably wise of you, c) waiting for the dust to settle before voting.

&gt;Are you kidding me?! This is American politics combined with centuries of human nature shaped by survival and economics! 

No, I'm not kidding.  Maybe if you voted more responsibly at a local level then we'd have better candidates for Congress and the Senate, and therefor the presidency.

I see a woman who won't apologize for anything she did wrong and who won't admit when she lies.  Sounds awfully familiar, doesn't it?

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","A book that's usually recommended to newcomers is [Speaker Building 201](http://www.parts-express.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?partnumber=500-044). I personally don't learn well from books so I've learned most of what I know by trying it out and sometimes making small fires :)

In terms of projects, a phenomenal speaker for the price is the ""Natalie"" version of the [Modula MTM](http://www.rjbaudio.com/RS180MTM/rs180-rs28-mtm.html) (scroll down to the natalie mtm design)

This one uses a unique crossover that is unlike most conventional ones and will really give you a soldering workout :) It's an ""MTM"" design, which means mid-tweeter-mid, which is what you see when the tweeter is in between the two larger speakers. The tweeter used is the [Dayton RS28a](http://www.partsexpress.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?&amp;Partnumber=275-130) which is a very well respected tweeter that outperforms those costing up to five times more. The woofers are the also very highly regarded [Dayton RS180 7"" reference drivers](http://www.partsexpress.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?&amp;Partnumber=295-364). These are very well constructed and equivalent to boutique European drivers costing much more. 

The total parts cost for all the speakers and other electronic doodads is probably around $250 for the pair. Cabinets you can toss together yourself from $30 of 3/4"" MDF and throw some paint on them, or if you are a bit more confident in your building abilities you can try a veneer job (you'll screw the first one up for sure). Parts epxress also sells finished veneered cabinets that are very nice but pricey: http://www.partsexpress.com/pe/showdetl.cfm?&amp;Partnumber=302-753

Similar looking and sounding speakers would cost about $3000 from a hifi shop. 

If you want something with similar quality there's an ""MT"" (mid-tweeter) version of that project called the [Modula MT](http://www.htguide.com/forum/showthread.php4?t=13154)
I have built this and it sounds excellent. It's pretty much the same as the other one I suggested but with one woofer instead of two. It's also quite cheap, under $200 for all the parts, and mine get quite loud before bottoming out. Still, I think given the time investment in putting these together for an extra $50 the MTM dual driver versions are a better choice.

There's literally a ton of stuff out there for any room/purpose/niche audio belief, so if you tell me what you are personally looking for I can probably find something that can fit.

Software-wise, there's some great free tools out there that you can use to design them yourself (I'd build a few pairs before designing your own, there's a lot to learn). The only bummer is that they're windows only but I put up with it since I'm addicted to this stuff :)
Here's a list:

[WinISD pro](http://www.linearteam.dk/default.aspx?pageid=winisdpro)
 is box modeling software. Put in the parameters for a speaker you're thinking about using, and you can see how the bass response will look like in different sized boxes, with different ports, and even band-pass style boxes. 

[SPL trace](http://www.pvconsultants.com/audio/utility/spl.htm) is a simple tool to trace manufacturer's response graphs into a text file you can then use to design a crossover with multiple drivers. This allows you to trace both the frequency response and the impedance (resistance), both of which you need for crossover design

[Frequency Response Modeler (Warning - link will commence download)](http://homepages.nyu.edu/~msa286/ResponseModeler.zip) is an excel-based tool that will allow you to alter the manufacturer's data you traced with SPLtrace to approximate the speaker's response in your own box. This can be a bit tricky and again, I'd learn about the principles of this stuff before just having at it. The files saved from this program are then ready for crossover design.

[Speaker workshop](http://homepages.nyu.edu/~msa286/ResponseModeler.zip) is your final step. This is where you import the files from response modeler and cobble together and tweak your crossover. This take a while to get right, and a LONG time to get good at. If the steps have been followed correctly, and assuming the data you started with was reasonably reliable. the finished speaker will perform very closely to the model. 

I've just given you far too much information, but I hope it's enough to get you started :)","1207092163"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I call myself an Atheist because firstly it seems very unlikely that there is a ""God"" as described by Religion. So my opinion is that there is no ""God"" because of lack of evidence. So then I think; ""what is the tiny tiny possibility that he is there without evidence?"" 

So then you need to look at the other options such as the Flying Spaghetti Monster or Cosmic Teapot or Father Christmas or Tooth Fairies and you realise that none of them have ""evidence"", but all *could exist* with about the same tiny tiny possibility.

But then of course you just need apply common sense.

So, you have no evidence, but a tiny possibility remains; apply common sense and it removes that tiny possibility.

*Q. Is there a Cosmic Teapot?
A. Very, very unlikly.*

*Q. What is your common sense telling you? 
A. No, there is not a Cosmic Teapot.*

While you can get all semantic and technical on the exact meanings of the words. This reasoning rules out all possibility of a ""God"" in the ""religious"" sense for me.

If you want to talk about ""God"" 
in terms of the ""God"" Einstein of Hawkins talks about - the ""God"" that is the ""unknown in the Universe"". Common sense connot rule this out.

If you hated WoW, it's because your guild sucked.

It could have been a few assholes the GM didn't kick from the guild. It could have been that nobody played at the same time you played. It could have been overbearing rules. Whatever. But the guild didn't meet your needs, so you had no fun.

WoW is not a game, it's an activity. It's a place to go to hang out with friends. If you're bitching about WoW, it's because you didn't have friends to play with that made the repetitive gameplay fun.

It's just like going to a bar, or going dancing... it's repetitive, boring, and pointless unless you're having fun with friends. Sure, some people like dancing alone  or drinking alone, but they are few and far between. Without a good guild, good friends, and a fun atmosphere there's zero reason to play WoW... it's a shitty game.

The last significant expansion before this  study happened in 1998, when vouchers went up to 15,000. 

Even today, vouchers are only up to 22,000. If we use your ""logic"" that we can deduce from the relative size of the program how long the average kid has been in, we would have to conclude that the average kid has been in more than long enough for it to make a difference.

 Communism I'll give you. But we absolutely do not agred that socialism is not associated with prosperity.

I'll certainly grant that the *ideology* is not associated with prosperity...in *America*. Americans are bombarded by that anti-socialist propoganda constantly, often by the same Republicans that go on to commit the most brainless, heinous, wasteful corporate welfare.

But meanwhile, outside the US, models of moderate, intelligent government planning (within a capitalist framework) is producing results.

I remember when the EU formed, and the US media was filled with stories mocking their socialist economies and the miles of red tape and endless regulations the government created to organize their economy. Now the EU has passed the US as the world's greatest economic power. So who's laughing now?

Japan sprung back from the poverty and destruction of WWII to become one of the world's biggest economies, despite being a small country with very few natural resources, that even has to import half its food.

Stuff like that isnt just free markets working themselves out. Japan's infrastructure involved a tremendous amount of central planning. Because of the dangerously low amounts of resources, the government was working on tree conservation and re-planting as far back as the 1600s.

about your questions-

1. To be honest I don't know exactly how this was funded, and I'm writing from my phone so its hard to research. But given their record, I suspect that any subsidies they got were tied to specific goals regarding cars with lower fuel consumption. Lowering Japan's dependence on oil has been a major goal of the government for a very long time (it goes beyond environmental concerns).

2. Overall Japan has had a very good track record for successful businesses, but I don't doubt that if you look hard enough you'll find a story of a company that still failed. Even a batter swinging .450 misses the ball.

The point isn't that government is this magical fairy godmother that blesses everything it touches. It isn't, it's certainly fallible. But a government representing central national interests has abilities and advantages that the free market doesn't (and, of course, vice-versa). And with the right planning and intelligent common goals, it *is* possible for government and industry to occasionally cooperate and synergize their efforts.","1207092674"

"science","t5_mouw","Speaking of conspiracies, I’m at a loss as to what i can do about a very dangerous murder conspiracy against me and others, for over 2 and a half years I’ve suffered from this conspiracy, it began { as best as i can tell,} when my wife joan wagar started having a affair with a co-worker named eric carlson, there affair started around April of 2005, i had reason to believe they was trying to kill me back then but i wasnt sure at the time, I’m very very sure now! there is a very interesting fact about eric that joan tried to hide from me and my daughters, he is almost identical in appearance to me! my wife nicknamed him doubleclick, when i learned of my wifes affair i also learned of that nickname and asked joan “why do you call him doubleclick ” she said ” oh thats what everyone calls him at work,” ever since my wife joan insisted her affair was over, it never ended, year and a half all kinds of odd things was happening i started getting very sick from time to time, i suspected she was poisoning me but was not sure at the time, i am now! in early 2006 around Feb or mar i went to the hospital asking to be tested because my wife was talking in her sleep saying she was poisoning me, i went to OHSU and signed in, they informed me that its unlikely that they will find anything but they took my vitals and i waited in the lobby, i waited 4 and a half hours and they never called me back to be checked, and no officers came to question me about my concerns. so i went home, i could tell no one there cared. this is just too long to explain so i will try to get to the point, on march 26th of 2007 at 5;55 am i put a audio recorder in joans purse because i heard my wife whispering to someone in her bedroom, { i slept on the couch, our marriage was falling apart.} i heard what sounded like a guy whispering back, so i put my recorder in her purse expecting to finally catch joan in the act and laid down pretending to still be asleep, ten minutes later my wife left for work, what i caught on there was a lot more than i expected, i caught a murder conspiracy! i didn’t know it right away because the audio i got is like 17 hours long, when i heard on it she was with eric two days later i left her and moved in with my oldest daughter shawna, i spent the next week and a half on and off trying to listen to this audio, it didn’t take long to figure out i was being framed for something by my wife and her lover, and they had help! lots of help, i learned i was under INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI and these INVESTIGATORS were good friends with joan and eric and they all met up at our apartment that morning in joans bedroom, they climbed in through joans window, i learned they were there to frame me as a pedophile, eric was posing for pictures in kayles bedroom,{ our youngest daughter,} while the INVESTIGATOR named ERICA { last name unknown to me.} was taking pictures of him while kayle slept, after words eric climbed out joans window and waited for her in her car, and a john ray climbed in and helped joan put something on our computer and then he left the way he came, joan finished getting ready for work and picked up her purse and left for work, once outside joan was talking to these INVESTIGATORS and discussing what they was going to do next, joan and eric on the ride to work was discussing what they was going to say to other employees when they get there, joan mentioned to eric {you woke her up} referring to kayle, and then they discussed breaking into shawnas apartment with ERICA, after lots of listening to that audio i learned joan eric and erica planed to rape shawna and murder her and then frame me for this! they planed to use a signed check of mine to purchase a gun in my name, remember eric looks almost like me in appearance, eric was going to use my ID and one of my checks to purchase a gun, joan was instructed to collect my sperm, eric was going to rape and murder shawna, erica was going to plant my sperm on shawnas body along with other false evidence, joan and eric met up at walmart along with vickie {joans sister} and the investigators and was waiting at the front door for someone to let them in, other employees showed up and the investigators pretended to have caught me in the act, [ referring to eric in kayles room,} and saying they got me on fotogenic, once inside the investigators proceed to put on a phony show of investigating while in the presence of walmart employees while joan and eric and vickie are trashing my name to there fellow employees turning everyone there against me, joan was even addmeting eric has been impersonating me for other crimes, after hours and hours of the investigators claiming in walmart employees presence that i was doing wrong things and joan and eric telling countless lies about me the investigators gave permission to all of them to pedifie me, joan started printing out flyers about me at walmart,{ unknown to me whether they used them or not.} from this point on they was pedifieing me openly in shawnas neaborhood, just flat out calling me a pedophile to others in that neaborhood, this hole time i spent most of my time on the floor in pain from donna poisoning me, i flat out knew i could get no help calling 911 since these were people in authority doing this to me, they stopped doing this when shawna was around they didn’t want her to know about it, i told shawna about this but she didn’t believe me because she never witnessed any of it and no one at work mentioned this to her, she believed donna poisoned me but she never understood any of the other stuff, the investigators were quite until shawna left for work and was loud when she left, they would say things like { were going to FUCK you over now you son of a bitch!} i remained in the apartment for about a week after donna poisoned me unable to walk much because of the pain, around this time eric showed up downstairs talking very loudly up at the investigators, { the investigators were on the third floor on the patio and eric was on the ground talking up at them, shawnas app is in between them} and eric was loudly calling me a pedophile and giving my description to others who were out there trying to piss me off, i didn’t go out to confront him because i knew they wanted to shoot me, before he left he yelled up at the investigators telling them to make sure i drink my coffee, keep in mind they weren’t hiding any of there murder attempts from me, after all eric and joan had permission from the authorities to murder me so they just don’t give a shit, i have reason to believe the authorities pressed charges against me and gave my disscription on tv because where ever i go people seem to recognize me, people in shawnas old neaborhood would point over at me and say “there’s the guy they pedified.” ever since i have been under attack behind my back and in front of my face, i learned from that audio that they pedified me in prison so if i get arrested for anything i will likely be murdered in prison, after they poisoned me at some point they broke into shawnas app and replaced my audio with a differant version hoping i would think its the original, i didn’t fall for that,there version is nothing but a death threat against me and shawna and there demonstrating how they plan to frame my hole family and give them the blame for me being poisoned and pedofied, and at the end of it there flat out frameing me as a pedophile using my voice and kayles, although they made the mistake of admitting somewhere in the middle of the audio that there using kayles voice, on there replacement audio they threatened to pedofie shawna if i say something about this, well they already did that, what it amounts to is they tried to kill me and shawna, i caught them in the act , and then they threatened to kill us if i talk about it and then they tried to kill us again, so it does me no good to heed there threats, as far as I’m concerned they murdered me already and there in the process of murdering shawna right now, there have been too many attempts to tell them all on this, let me suffice it to say the other nite joan and a couple of her friends came here to murder me and that plan failed, but there not scared about it because they have some people in authority covering there asses, i write this on November 13th 2007 and at this very moment this apartment is under a illegal video survielence by the FBI, and they allow others over the Internet to spy on us and make fun of us, chances are there going to murder me for sending this because they made it clear there going to cover there asses, but thats why i saved the best for last. p.s. the address where this ocured is 8800 se causey loop n-205 clackamas OR 97086, the whole neaberhood there has heard of this and the authorities used a warrant to kick out the tenants above shawnas apartment. in 2005 my wife joan wagar was poisoning me, and i was a regular blood donor at the time, when i discovered this i went to the OHSU emergency hospital to get checked and to report this, but no one cared. police are notified and they dont care, there covering this up by ignoring this.","1207093436"

Qgyh2 i'm a fan of most of your posts. However the title is seriously misleading. In this age of growing islamophobia, i would hope that someone with as much karma points would be more careful when posting inflammatory remakes. 

Naturally if  a school is composed of a majority of Muslims then the majority of people who are going to complain are going to be muslin. You unfairly  singled them out. Furthermore, the article makes the point time and time again that the main issues was the lack of consultation ( not homophobia).

Things that were rejected by the system after being inputted by mortgage folks: obviously fake social security numbers, extremely low credit ratings, low monthly income, falsified income statements. 

The system was designed to reject these things, but often the submitters did everything in their power to get it to accept the application and grant a mortgage or a loan. Numbers were massaged until it worked. 

The people that worked at the mortgage company were greedy for commissions and the people seeking a mortgage were greedy for a big McMansion that they couldn't afford. It was a disgustingly symbiotic relationship. ","1207094376"

If Persians were a small minority in Iran I could understand the insecurity better. Just like how Scotsmen hate to be called British or Quebecois bristle at being called Canadian or Catalonians don't like to be called Spanish. These ethnically/linguistically distinct minorities want to distinguish themselves from the dominant majorities in their countries. 

OTOH, Persians *are* the dominant majority in Iran. There is no difference between a Persian and an Iranian. The dominant culture of Iran *is* Persian. I can't think of another dominant majority from any country whose diaspora insists on being called by their ethnicity instead of the country they come from.

It is sad to say, that this discussion will probably never end – the movie not withstanding. But, it is possible to simply dismiss it as fool hardy. The problem with Intelligent Design (ID), promoted primarily by the Discovery Institute and other supporting Christian conservatives, is of coarse the “supposed” theory which assumes that some of the building blocks of life are irreducibly complex to the point where they could not have evolved by themselves and have adopted the idea that an intelligent designer, a creature more advanced than the human race, must have created them.  This group calls this a scientific theory while decrying Darwin’s theory of evolution as seriously flawed; therefore, ID should be taught in public schools as a parallel scientific alternative if not the only one.  However, they provide no neal scientific proof.  Actually, it’s an old idea first promoted by William Paley, an English Anglican Minister, in 1802.  I think we have progressed a little since then.

It is simple to intellegently dismiss the idea: “All scientific theories must contain within them the condition under which they may be shown to be false.”  In other words, the theory that God created the world can never be a scientific one because it cannot contain an explanation of the conditions under which the theory could be proven false.  Ideas that seek to define such things as ethics, esthetics, God or other deities, etc., therefore, are more philosophical and remain outside the realm of science.  The word theory, as defined in the Webster’s New World Dictionary implies, “considerable evidence in support of a general formulated principle explaining the operation of certain [scientific] phenomena” – those things that ethics, esthetics, beliefs in God or other deities cannot do.

Only repeatable, verifiable tests and/or other supporting evidence approved by majority of scientific peers can determine as to whether or not whether Darwin’s theory, or any other theory, is plausibly correct or that there are better solutions to the problem.  So far, no verifiable, supportable evidence from the IDer crowd. Thus far, Darwin’s Theory of Evolution has amassed a vast amount of supporting evidence to the idea that it is true even though there are some anomalies that cannot be fully explained at the moment (the general theory of relativity has the same problem) It provides, with out a doubt, the best scientific biological explanation currently available on how life forms have developed or evolved from the molecular level to the macrocosmic level and it continues to do so.  Darwin’s theory does not attempt to define positively how life began, only how it evolved afterwards. The seeds of life may have come from space, from the ground beneith our feet or a chemical reaction within the oceans -  it is anyones guess, and we will probaly never know.  If you want to say they came from God, then do so.  Just don’t call that scientific.

This brings us to the question, “Who is the higher power in the ID theory?”  Those who support this idea claim that it is not necessarily God and seek not to identify the designer.  But if it is not God, then it must be some other equivalent super being or deity. This kind of a premise, stating this kind of condition, has a problem in that it does not contain the required condition of a theory: that under which it can be proven false because one cannot prove or disprove the existence of the higher power.  Therefore, by logical deduction, ID cannot be classified as a scientific theory – end of argument.  In this regard, ID actually favors a subjective theistic solution of divine intervention in the creation of the universe and all things within it.  This is “idea” is based only upon faith whereby faith is more important than personal understanding and there in lies the flaw.  Faith, by definition, is the act of taking some one else’s word for something – which is not scientific by any stretch of the imagination.  Science is the process of third party objective thinking, not subjective.

It's a very hard ""one thing"", but I believe that is will be less difficult (and less expensive) than an unending war in the middle east.

*REMEMBER FACTS AREN'T WELCOME ON THIS SITE.  RATING DOWN BASED ON OPINION IS MUCH BETTER*

From wikipedia.

""Vista modifies the behavior of asynchronous I/O operations. With the new asynchronous I/O APIs, a thread, different from the one that issued the I/O request, can be notified when the operation completes. With this, a single thread can issue all the IO requests, and then switch to a different worker thread. If this thread is the one that handles the data after the IO request completes, then a thread-switch, which causes a performance hit, may be avoided. Windows Vista also introduces synchronous I/O cancellation. During a synchronous I/O request, the application is blocked till the request is serviced or fails. In Windows Vista the application may issue a cancellation request. Applications that cancel the operation on user feedback may prefer to enable user feedback during the time the issuing thread is suspended for usability.

Windows Vista also implements I/O scheduling as prioritized I/O [1]. Disk I/O requests in Windows Vista are assigned priorities; a higher priority request is given preferential treatment, over a request that has a lower priority, during the execution of the request. Windows Vista defines five priority classes - Very Low, Low, Normal, High and Critical. By default I/O requests are assigned Normal priority. Windows Vista also allows reservation of bandwidth on a per-application basis during disk access; this aims to guarantee the required throughput rate to the application when it accesses the disk. Both these features are used by Windows Media Player with respect to media playback.[2]

Prior to Windows Vista, all I/O requests were capped at 64 KB; thus larger operations had to be completed in chunks. In Windows Vista, there is no limit on the size of I/O requests. This means an entire I/O operation can be completed by issuing fewer requests, which in turn may lead to higher performance. Windows Explorer and the command prompt's Copy command have been modified to issue 1 MB requests.[2]""","1207095326"

The argument that actions can be random isn't any more beneficial than saying our actions are completely determined by physics.  To have ""true"" free will the actor (human) has to be the initiator of the act, not physics or randomness.

From Wiki:
""There is also a further, more philosophical, objection. It has been argued that if an action is taken due to quantum randomness, this in itself means that free will is absent, since such action cannot be controllable by someone claiming to possess such free will.[55] If this argument is conjoined with incompatibilism, then it would follow that free will is impossible, since it would be incompatible with both determinism and indeterminism, and these are the only options. If it is conjoined with compatibilism, on the other hand, it would mean that free will is only possible in a deterministic universe.""

It is a system that imprisons non custodial parents and in some states charges them with a felony for back child support, even if the parent is living below the poverty level and a system that leaves 62% of custodial parents without child support leaving them and their children to live below the poverty level. 
Childsupporttv.com has been set up to give both sides a place to tell their stories and empower themselves with the tools to understand their rights.  It has also been set up to put pressure on the powers that be to work on reforming this system that even victimizes our soldier’s who come back from the war to find their licenses suspended and bank accounts garnished over back child support from orders that existed before they went off to war.   
Half of uneducated African American men ages 25-34 are non-custodial fathers. The child support they struggle to pay usually does not go to their children, but instead goes to the state to reimburse the cost of public assistance, including welfare, for the mother and children. This is demoralizing for low-income men struggling to make a difference in their kids’ lives. Some of these fathers even live with their children and their children’s mothers, yet their wages are still garnisheed to pay child support to the state.
Many minority non custodial fathers have spent time in prison, often for nonviolent drug offenses. Under the current system, these men rack up thousands of dollars in child support arrearages while they are incarcerated. Interest accrues rapidly, and upon release many ex-offenders struggle under a staggering debt they could never hope to pay off. Some even return to jail for nonpayment.
Log on to childsupportv.com and tell us your story and empower yourself with knowledge how to navigate this system.  We want 1,000,000 Americans to tell us their story so we can put pressure on Congress to work on reforming this system.  
Each and every week we will also Take It To The Nation, to get your opinion on a story concerning Child Support.   
As we learn more about the system I will bring in experts from government agencies as well as non profits to help us find solutions to this issue that effects all Americans regardless of color or economic status.

Kucinich's plan was to expand the national health care plan enjoyed by Congressmen and government employees to all citizens for free.  Obama proposes something similar, but will charge you for it.  Clinton will subsidize buying health care from HMOs, and will force you to do it.

EDIT: I want Kucinich's too, but failing that I'll take Obama's over Clinton's, I think it moves us in a more progressive direction.  Clinton's is similar to what was implemented by Romney in Massachusetts, and what Schwarzeneggar is attempting to implement in California, which claims universal coverage, but only by strongarming people who can't afford it into buying health care from existing insurance providers.","1207095827"

You've just reshaped the argument, not refuted free will.  The next question to argue is can and do human brains cause things to happen?  Exclusively?  What degree of exclusivity of cause is necessary for free will?  Does the human have to be the primary actor or just ""an"" actor?  Or maybe you could define the cause as ""could not have happened without the human.""

You make a counter suggestion which is based on your own views as to why A doesn't work and how you can best go about achieving your set goals.

People of the land of Iran, going back to the days of the early ""persian"" empires have always called themselves iranians. 

The term persian, was a western term for the people of that region and its empires. 

Back, a couple thousand years, like under Cyrus, the Greeks would say for example, ""that Cyrus guy is the king of Persia"" and the people in Iran would say, ""hey, this Cyrus guy is the king of us Iranians and the land of Iran.""

If you speak a persian language (farsi is the only living language today, I think...), your still just an iranian. 

If you speak Arabic, your a semite. [sorry madronedorf-(few comments above), a parties lack of connotation does not disqualify a terms use]

And yes, there are Arabs living in Iran and Iranians living in Arab states. 

And there are Iranians that speak Arabic, and Arabs that speak Farsi. 

What's the difference? Well, as j79 should know, Iranians can cuss all they want because God only speaks Arabic.

The same with the Democratic Party. It was the reason the founding fathers did not want political parties. When people vote in the primaries, they are voting on a person to be pledged to vote for their choice, unlike local primaries where you vote for the person. 
It has happened before where someone pledged to vote, changed their mind. Look at the Electoral College. Many times in the past a person who was pledged changed their vote. It is something not new to American politics.

I think we're following a pretty similar lifestyle and it's way more reasonable than others in terms of environment and energy consumption - but it's still far from being sufficient.

I firmly believe that the so called 'developed' countries need to give up their individual centered concepts of living.
It makes no sense to have a billion refrigerators running to cool down plain air while people are going to the restaurant or cooking for but a single person.
We're multiplying facilities we rarely use because we somehow believe every one of us needs his own set of them to be independent.
The same time depression is becoming a mass phenomena because we never felt as alone before etc etc pp

well .. long story short: the big picture is a massive and complex problem and you need to change almost every single aspect to really have an impact.

&gt;The Wisconsin law that created the program requires participating schools to conduct lotteries to admit students whenever they have more applicants than spaces available.
This makes random-assignment studies of the program possible. The first State of Wisconsin evaluations, conducted in 1990-1995, did not use random-assignment research
designs, but two later evaluations did. The first, conducted by Jay Greene of the University of Texas, and Paul Peterson
and Jiangtao Du of Harvard University, found that MPCP students who won lotteries and were able to attend private schools outperformed a control group of students who lost those lotteries and remained in MPS schools. **After four years in the program, the treatment group of MPCP students
produced standardized test results that were 6 normal curve equivalent points higher than the control group in reading, and 11 points higher than the control group in math**.1
Princeton University economist Cecilia Rouse published a second analysis of the Milwaukee school choice program employing a random-assignment design.2 Using a slightly
different set of test scores than was used by Greene, Peterson, and Du, Rouse found that **students able to attend private
schools with vouchers outperformed the control group by 8 percentile points on a standardized math test after four years in the program.** She found no statistically significant effect from the program in reading.","1207097190"

It was created by a relatively unknown games theorist/social psychologist Peter Faunmburm.  This German-born doctor created a test that could identify mutant genes in human test subjects.  Simple rodents (rats, rabbits, muskrats) were taught to play the game and all were able to find the crown in a relatively short time-frame (X +/- 3.2M).  The highest level achieved by a rodent of any class was level 13.  

Several competing games theorists deemed the test too impossible for human use, as merely completing level 27 drives the user insane  (Editor's Note: Insanity is reversed upon completing level 33).

If a user is able to reach level 45, unexpected sociopsyiological changes start to occur.  At every level past 45 the user gains one minor psychic power.  At even levels past 45 a user gains one major psychic power.  By level 175 (the last theoretical level) a user can command the rules of grammar and basic printing capacities.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The **educational reality** today is that kids in voucher schools are doing no better than their peers in public schools.

And I think you're confused about what happened:

The original study conducted between 1991-1995 by John Witte found *no difference* between the groups.

The so-called ""evaluation"" by Green, etc. was  **an OP-ED piece** in which they claimed they re-analyzed the data and came to a different result. But not one that they were willing to submit to peer-review, apparently. The Rouse ""evaluation"" was just another re-analysis of Witte's data. Her ""evaluation"" was deeply flawed, as was Green etal's op-ed piece.

&gt;The problems with the Greene, Peterson, and Du reanalysis of the Milwaukee data are manifold. For example, **their own tables (specifically 4, 5, and 6) do not support their claims about reading achievement or, in some instances, about math achievement** either. Furthermore, **the number of students involved is so small** (as few as 26 cases) **that any claims about the significance of their findings must be viewed with considerable suspicion.**  

&gt;**In Ms. Rouse's case, she writes that ""... I estimate** that private school students gained approximately 1.3 percentage points per year (in math and reading combined) and **the effect has a p-value of 0.063."" Since the standard protocol for statistical significance is 0.05 or lower one must wonder just what Ms. Rouse has demonstrated.** She goes on to say that **she ""had to impute the total math score for a significant fraction of Milwaukee public school students**,"" that there was ""substantial sample attrition in later years,"" and that her statistical strategies ""cannot substitute for better data."" It is hard to see how evidence this weak suggests that a nationwide ""experiment"" with taxpayer-financed vouchers is either a good way to improve the quality of education for poor children or a wise use of public money. Nevertheless, the shift of elite opinion toward vouchers continues.  

[had to impute = made it up, just so you know. When you just make up the scores you want, of course you're going to get the findings you want.]

&gt;**Exotic statistical treatments deployed in an attempt to divine the putative academic benefits conferred by Milwaukee's voucher program may be useful in confusing editorial writers**, but they can reveal nothing about the more important political lesson to be drawn from Milwaukee's experience with vouchers. That lesson is now emerging as the coalition that successfully created the voucher program in Milwaukee crumbles.  

Simply put, don't put your faith in an OP-ED over a peer-revied study when the op-ed writers' own tables don't say what they say they do, and people admit that even after they ""impute"" scores that aren't available, they *still* can't meet the standards for statistical significance.

It's no wonder that the more recent studies have replicated Witte's findings, and not those of the op-ed writers.

Then you get eggs on a regular basis, whether you use them or not, and you still need to use hundreds or thousands of eggs just to break even on your up-front costs.  Pay yourself a reasonable wage for all your work and it's even longer.

And if you're in a residential area, I give it two weeks before your neighbors are screaming at you about the noise and the smell.

If you take all this into account, the final cost for the eggs will be ... just what you pay at the store, minus the markup.  And that's only if you can be as efficient as a large-scale chicken farm, and you can't.","1207097907"

"math","t5_2qh0n","It seems for many of these ""games"" you can view them at multiple levels.  In soccer, the number of goals is not fixed, so the run of the game is not zero-sum.  But there is only one winner who can only win by taking that away from the other player.  So at that level soccer is a zero sum game.

Similarly for elections without compulsory voting.

At some point in these discussions we need to pin down exactly what is being discussed.  Is the game ""winning votes"" or is it ""being declared the election winner""?

&gt;In this case it is a zero sum game since a candidate can only gain a percentage point by taking it from another candidate.

Any game could be expressed in the same way.  If Liverpool beat Arsenal 3-1, they could be said to have won 75% of the goals.  This obscures an important point -- that Arsenal could have won 4-3 without taking goals away from Liverpool.

That brings me back to my original point: was the game ""scoring goals"" (which is not zero-sum) or ""winning the soccer match"" (which is zero-sum)?

no, i do not think the american government gets most things right. but i am quite positive that had the industry been left to its own devices, with no tax breaks or incentives to any side, americans would have come up with a better solution, simply because we need it more. japan is much smaller, and the benefit of an efficient car would have been less. again, this is not a jab at your culture or anything like that. take for example, the car in india that sells for 2.5 grand. americans simply don't have the incentive to make it. doesn't mean we're stupid. there was no government subsidy to tata motors. they just wanted to make money.

"reddit.com","t5_6","And what does Margaret Sanger have to do with Parley's lies?

Is this another one of those men's-behavior- is-always-women's-fault things?

Parsley's inability to tell the truth is the fault of a woman who has been dead for decades, whom he probably never even met?

Amazing. What a lousy view you must have of men. I refuse to believe that men are such moral children that they cannot be expected to tell the truth if this woman or that happens to have existed at some point in history. 

I work everyday with fine, decent, honest, upstanding, responsible men. Men who are smart, successful, intelligent, and forthright. To use a cliche, men whose word is their bond. I cannot think of one man who works on the hall that I do that I wouldn't trust to do the right thing even if no one were watching--or with my life in an emergency.

So I refuse to believe that Margaret Sanger's founding of Planned Parenthood gives Parsley the right to lie, or somehow magically prohibits him from being an honest person. When Parsley lies--especially when he lies about the KKK and whose side it is really on--it's because that's his character and who he has chosen to be.

"programming","t5_2fwo","This is a personalized news site that I wrote in two months based on algorithms from the book Programming Collective Intelligence. Please tell me what you think.
It has two main features: the ability to identify related/similar links and suggestions/recommendations that actually work.

The basis for all of the algorithms is a document similarity metric presented in Chapter 3: Discovering Groups. Basically, to compare document A with document B, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the word frequencies of document A and the word counts of document B. (You can imagine this as plotting a series of points of a graph: each point's x coordinate is its frequency in document A and each point's Y coordinate is its frequency in document B. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of how well the line-of-best-fit fits the points.)

Using this similarity metric, links can be clustered together using K-means clustering. This is what you get when you click on “related” at the bottom of each link. Clicking on “similar” gives the results of running K-NN. (“related” doesn't work as well as it could be right now because there are too few links for a link to be similar with, but this is an example of where it does work: http://fyynd.com/links/197/related/ “similar” usually works better right now.)

There are two algorithms for giving recommendations, “Suggested” and “Recommended”. ""Recommended"" generally works better than Suggested when you haven't yet made votes but Suggested should be more in tune to your preferences in the long run.

In layman's terms, the Recommendation algorithm works by ""averaging"" together the links that you liked and then find links that are similar to that while the Suggestion algorithm tries to determine whether you will like a particular link by seeing whether it is similar to any page that you have already rated highly. As a result, ""Recommended"" will list pages in your general interest area, but insensitive to any ""niche"" interest that you might have. The ""Suggested"" page will be sensitive to ""niche"" interests but will requires more votes to train. For example, if most of the link you rate highly are about computer science, with a only a few links about biology, when the recommendation algorithm averages them together, the biology links would count for very little. As a result, you wouldn't see much on biology. On the other hand, the suggestion algorithm will not be hindered by this, though it will have trouble if you don't vote much.

Please note that because predictions are so computationally intensive, they are not updated in real-time but on a hourly basis. Thus, you have to wait a bit before they come out. Please be patient!

Ancient Greeks were not...liberal people. If a woman had a tan, it was a sign she was unfaithful as she had 'no right' to be outside of the house to get a tan. Hence the epithets given to 'virgin' goddesses in Homer's epics: 'Pale armed Athene' and etc. Dawn, the goddess of morning who was known to come down from the sky to 'claim' (IE semi-consensual rape, one did NOT say no to a goddess or they would curse you, just look at how many of them Odysseus shagged on the way home to his 'beloved wife') men for her desires was known as 'rosy faced dawn' (certain translations, I believe that one is in the oxford worlds classics editions).

"programming","t5_2fwo","I am Mrs Queen Manda from Netherlands,I am 58 years old,i am deaf and suffering 
from a long time cancer of the breast which also affected my brain,from all 
indication my conditions is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that, 
according to my doctors they have advised me that i may not live for the next 
two months,this is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I 
was brought up from a motherless babies home was married to my late husband for 
twenty years without a child ,died in a fatal motor accident Before his death we 
were true Christians.

Since his death I decided not to re-marry,I sold all my inherited belongings and 
deposited all the sum of $8.6million dollars with a Security Company.Presently, 
this money is still with them and the management just
wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money for keeping it 
so long or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on 
my behalf since I can not come over because of my illness or they get it 
confisticated.

Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital where I have been undergoing 
treatment for cancer of the lungs. I have since lost my ability to talk and my 
doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.

It is my last wish to see that this money is invested to any organisation of 
your choice and distributed each year among the charity organization,the poor 
and the motherless babies home where i come from.I want you God fearing, to also 
use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows,I took this decision, 
before i rest in peace because my time will soon be up.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security 
Company.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the 
new beneficiary of my fund. Please assure me that you will act
accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you soon.

Waiting for your reply

Yours in Christ

"programming","t5_2fwo","The difference from my experience is that there are rarely dedicated testing, documentation, sysadmin, and project management staff.  In the development teams I've worked on, the people in  these roles are at a minimum shared with the rest of the development group, if not shared by multiple development groups.  When you only get 30 minutes of a person's time a day, it's not nearly as effective as having dedicated support staff, and the programmers spend a lot of time doing tasks that belong to those other roles.

I find that this problem is particularly acute when it comes to QA.  It's very hard to get good QA engineers.  We typically have one QA engineer, with limited coding skills, serving a development team of anywhere from 10-30 people.  As a result, you get into a situation where the developers write all the tests, and the QA engineer just runs them periodically and reports the results.  (Note that I'm not talking about unit tests.  I'm talking about functional, regression, and performance test suites.)","1207099911"

"reddit.com","t5_6","My explanation of my argument was not very good.

The old argument for determinism, is that all things in the universe--including atoms in your brain--behave according to the laws of physics. If we knew the position and velocity and forces acting on every thing in the universe, we could calculate the position and velocity and force in the next moment. And if we can do that, we can calculate how everything in the universe will be for the whole future--including the activities of your brain.

This idea became popular when science seemed to be figuring everything out, and the universe looked like it was working like clockwork. It became less popular when physicists learned more about the behavior of quantum particles, and how crazily unpredictable they are.

But in general, things in the universe are still kind of behaving like clockwork. With the exception of totally random things, which by their nature you could not have willed, your brain still behaves predictably according to laws of physics. Basically, my argument is that the scientific advances which discredited determinism did not at all credit the idea of free will.

In any case, what did you mean when you said I reshaped the argument, and why do you say that what you said is the next question? Also, in the piece that you quoted, I never really meant ""a human brain""; I meant that if _any_ thing caused something to happen a particular way, then the result would be determined, by the cause.

My only spin on this is that the government likely only gave money under the explicit condition that it be used to develop technology that would result in more fuel efficient cars. Whether they had specific ideas about an electric/gas hybrid, I don't know. If not, that would be a good example of  government goals merging with the innovation of free enterprise.

&gt;I guess we differ on our views of the social and environmental benefits of pure capitalism and socialism. i would venture to say that the best balance between environmental and human well being comes from capitalism. that is a much longer debate, and we will not resolve this anytime soon.

It's a can of worms for sure. But I don't see how raw capitalism is the best solution for the environment. If the core concern is making a profit, then the priority is on producing goods as cheaply as possible. The greatest resistance to environmental reforms comes from private industry, who see environmental regulations as strangling their businesses and hindering free enterprise. 

&gt;Finally, 'central national interests' have been at the base of some ridiculous, silly and downright evil schemes. 

Well sure. Governments need to remain Democratic and accountable to the needs of the people. When you have a government overturning rule of law and just doing what they want without accountability, you throw the bums out. But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

The Government here has been trying to raise taxes to build up the military, and then they  lost millions of social security records. The voters responded by handing them a major electoral defeat, and the Prime Minister had to resign. But no-one complained about the Toyota funding for green initiatives. People here are very concerned about the environment  and alternative forms of energy.

There seems to be an idea in the USA that the government is corrupt, therefore, the less the government does in public life, the better.

The government is supposed to be a body of people that represent the country, democratically elected by the people. If its healthy, it functions in the public self interest. No governments are perfect, and all suffer at least some corruption. But some are better and more effective than others.","1207100374"

"science","t5_mouw","Some information from the book Earth: The Sequel that puts this in context:

*Why do biofuels have a smaller role to play than solar?*

""Biofuels may play a smaller role than photovoltaics or solar thermal electricity in reducing global carbon emissions, for one simple reason: plants are far less efficient at converting an acre of solar radation to usable energy. They did not evolve, after all, to optimize energy production, but to adapt, survive, and reproduce. Even switchgrass, a cutting-edge energy crop, is only one-twentienth as efficient as the cheapest solar cell. It converts just .3 percent of incoming solar energy into chemical energy; Spectrolab's solar cells, by contrast, convert 42 percent. It also has ongoing needs for nutrients and requires all the work of growing, harvesting, and processing. The amount of water demanded by biofuels production alone is immense, with most crops requiring about a thousand tons of water for each ton of biomass."" (p. 76)

""The amount of land required to grow enough biomass to displace significant amounts of petroleum with biofuels is daunting. The United States uses 140 billion gallons of gasoline and 40 billion gallons of diesel fuel each year. Converting the nation's entire soy crop to biodiesel would meet just 6 percent of diesel demand-- and would increase pressure on producers like Brazil, where rainforests continue to be cleared at a furious prace to plant soy te meet global demand. At current average yields, according to the biomolecular engineering professor Kyriacos Zygourakis of Rice University, replacing just 30 percent of the gasoline consumed in the United States with ethanol made from switchgrass would require 200 million acres, equivalent to about half the total cropland in the United States."" (p. 80)

*Who are new sources of biofuels needed even though the energy potential is so much less than that of solar?*

""In a civilization as centered as ours on the automobile, however, and a global economy so dependend on transport, fluid fuels will necessarily play a crucial part. While there are many clean ways to make electricity, and while electricity may in the future become the prime power source for transport, there is simply no immediate substitute for liquid fuels, which, as currently produced, inflict a heavy burden: the U.S. vehicle fleet pumps 1.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, and $820 million in capital is exported every day for the oil needed to do so."" (p. 77)

""The biofuels start-ups have much in their favor. The global oil supply is increasingly problematic. As easily accessible reserves mature, oil companies are forced to seek new supplies that are more difficult and expensive to develop and often contain more impurities, particularly sulfur; finding and developing these new oil reservoirs, then refining the 'cruder' crude they ield, means rising prices at the gas pump. With fully 50 percent of the world's oil reserves now owned or manages by state-controlled oil companies, it becomes even more difficult for oil giants to replace their reserves. Meanwhile, it becomes clearer every day that the United States' overwhelming dependence on foreign oil is a direct risk to national security, and that we must expand and diversify our sources of energy."" (p. 78)

Anyway, the book is called Earth: The Sequel by Fred Krupp and Miriam Horn. It's pretty good, and I think there is a strong case to be made for getting your information on renewables from a book rather than from miscellaneous reddit articles and press releases.

It just seems like it would be easy enough to add that feature seeing how they already have it for submissions. Maybe make clicking the comment's score itself show the official tally? And it is simplistic enough as well, seeing how minimalism seems to be a guiding force here at reddit.

You just think its OK to downmod information that conflicts with what you wish was true?

In the early chapters of the Koran the word ""jihad"" appears many times in these 2 but connected senses. In the early chapters dating from the Mecca period when Muhammad was leading a small minority sect the word more clearly has the meaning of moral striving.

In the later chapters, written in Medina,  when Muhammad was the leader of a state and commander of an army it usually is used in the sense of a more utilitarian physical struggle.

For example in IV 95 (I looked this up):

Those of the believers who stay at home, other than the disabled, are not equal to **those who strive in the path of God** with their goods and their persons. **God has placed those who struggle** with their goods and their persons on a higher level than those who stay at home. God has promised reward to all who believe but He distinguishes those **who fight** above those who stay at home, with a mighty reward.""

Fact is, both Planned Parenthood and the modern anti-choice movement have their roots in racism--as do most American institutions.

The difference is that the KKK and other racists are all on one side now--the anti-choice side. Your side. From David Duke, to Trent Lott, to Strom Thurmond to Brian Beckwith, you'll know them all by their anti-choice clamoring.

&gt;How much have I said about Parsley?

The ""cheap shot"" of your headline was about setting Parsley straight when he lied.

You seem to be saying that Parsley was justified in lying because Margaret Sanger existed.

I've yet to hear you admit that it was morally wrong for Parsley to tell the lie he did and that it was morally right for Amanda Marcotte to confront him on it.

In fact, instead you compound the lie:

&gt;My point was Parsley wasn't too far off

He was 100% off. The KKK supports **his**  position, not the pro-choice movement as he claimed. That's as off as you can be.

It is characteristic of you to claim it's ""not far off"" to tell the opposite of the truth. Disturbing, but characteristic.

You need help. When you are no longer able to tell the difference between ""the KKK is anti-choice"" and ""the KKK is pro-choice""...when you think those two statements are ""not far off"" from each other--it's time to get some serious psychiatric help.

I'm thinking of places like Manila and Mexico City.

Need I remind you that once Europe and the United States also suffered through similar pollution epidemics that plagued their biggest cities?  Pittsburgh's air was once as insufferable as Shenzhen's... but as the United States became richer and richer it became easier to control our environmental problems.

There was a time when Japan was lambasted as a disgusting pollution-filled country; now it is one of the cleanest on earth.  Just keep in mind to not just look at a country as a snapshot - look at where it was, where it is, and where it's going.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;I guess in the short term, people like myself who DO know the old way of doing CPR and are intelligent enough to read between the lines here will hopefully continue to do mouth to mouth resuscitation if we are dealing with a drowning victim or a child.

And I suspect that is what will continue to happen.  I took CPR last year and they taught us mouth-to-mouth as usual, although they did mention how it was being de-emphasized in dealing with the public.

After all, there are many levels of training in resuscitation, each with more steps and greater chances of reviving the victim with no damage to them.  I only took the most basic class (it was a requirement for a summer camp job I was working) and I know for a fact there are a hell of a lot of things I DON'T know about saving someone's life.  I think the idea is simply to keep the knowledge of better methods out there for those with training, but to try to get more untrained people willing to at least attempt *something* rather than let a victim lie there.

And beyond that, it (sadly) just becomes an issue of cost-benefit.  Take the number of people likely to die unnecessarily due to this ""improper"" simplified CPR and compare it to the number who are likely to die solely because of untrained bystanders who are afraid of mouth-to-mouth.  If B is significantly greater than A, then make B your policy.","1207102373"

'net' finally means money iirc (sorry .. not a native speaker but I guess I'm right here).

So you use money as a ruler to measure the value of resources.
you're not taking into account that the monetary system in itself is based on consuming resources (as opposed to using) and based on growth (as opposed to sustainability).

The whole promise of being rich one day is a scam, while happiness is totally affordable for all of us.

I'm trying to say that we urgently need to think about the rules we are trading by  and how we are organizing our lifes. And we need to stop to rely on the money-model and the economic system as we know it.

Besides, since the documents are super confusing, it would be super hard to create even a page for one browser. What Joel proposes would efficiently kill the WWW.

Later in his article he suddenly writes that the problem is not in the strict obeying to standards, but in numerous bugs in previous versions of IE.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Are you sure about Clinton's plan being an HMO insurance plan?  Most people rightfully believe that HMO's are second-rate and fear not being able to ""see their own doctor,"" because they don't fall under the HMO. 

From what I understand, the Clinton plan would let all insurance companies compete in the state-wide pool.  However, the conditions are that the companies must not deny coverage to someone, nor can they charge outrageous premiums (if they do, they cannot compete in the pool).  The state pays the premium for those who cannot afford insurance while those who can pay on a sliding scale based on income up to market premium (at which point it would be advantageous to opt out of the state pool).  The system will always work because there will always be a very large pool of customers and private companies to compete for them.   Because the state is a mediator, it can regulate these companies (e.g., ensure effective, comprehensive coverage in policy) and keep scam companies out of the pool thus insulating the poor and indigent from predatory HMO's and other scams.  I actually think its a very good idea because it would make insurance rates plummet, which would be good for the entire economy because of all the extra capital it would free up.    

The main difference with Obama's plan is that you can ""opt-out"" of having any insurance at all if you really want to while Hillary requires everyone to have insurance and if they do not, than to purchase it in the pool.  ","1207103231"

If you want to get angry, a fish on the back of a car is a lousy reason to do it. 

The reasons I gave would be much more valid reasons for anger, but he is unlikely to even think about those things.  You probably don't agree with that, though so look at it this way: If he had been thinking about the bigger issues, he certainly wouldn't be writing an op-ed on a bloody fish. 

If anything, that stupid fish represents a person's conscientious objection to the idiots who cause the problems I listed. Attacking that symbol instead of considering what that symbol itself is critiquing is a sign of a shallow mind. However, the author obviously would rather attack the symbol than consider anything else, like the idiocy that he protects when he critiques the symbol and ignores the message. 

So yeah, his critiquing that symbol is just an inverse way of promoting the crap mythologies that cause so many mistakes in society.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The general idea sounds good.  I have a several suggestions, however, as I do for everything:

-The whole Suggested vs Recommended thing seems overcomplicated.  I shouldn't have to read a paragraph-long explanation to understand the difference between the two pages.  Since you said that Recommended works better for new users who haven't voted much, I suggest merging the two pages into one that switches from the Recommended method to the Suggested method once the user votes enough to make Suggested the more accurate option. You could also offer an option to switch between the two methods.  In a related note, I would also suggest merging the Related and Similar options under each story into one, or at least explain the difference more clearly.

-An option to sort the Rated page by rating would be a nice touch.

-Make the logo link to the homepage.

-I would get rid of the keywords in the story list and make them only visible from the comments.  I don't see the purpose of having them visible on the main page, they are just distracting.  Making the words links to stories also containing that word would be good.

-I don't think the name is very memorable.  The whole 'incorrectly spell a word related to the premise of the site' thing is getting pretty old to me.  I don't *hate* it, but I think you could probably find something better.  It doesn't have to be clever, just something people will remember.  

-I think it needs to differentiate itself from its competitors a lot more if it is going to get popular.  I know this probably isn't your top priority, but make (or have someone make) a good logo.  Make it look less like Reddit.  Advertise its unique features right on the front page for people who aren't logged in.  Make it impossible for someone to miss how your site differs from Digg and Reddit.

Do these things and I think you could do well.","1207103769"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Right.  The chords are interesting.  ""I'll be watching you"" always goes to an E-minor on the word *you*, producing a feeling of foreboding (or stalking, perhaps).  

Except the very end of the song (the outro) when ""I'll be watching you"" hits the *you* on a major chord, giving the feeling of watching her in a way where he's not so obsessed with her.

There is a playful toggling between whether the overall key for the song should be E-minor or G-major.  The outro suggests G-major, but the entire song prior to that suggests E-minor.  

Since the outro is the last thing heard, many people come away from the song feeling something like: 

watching-the-girl-in-a-nice-way after-overcoming-the-bad-feelings that-I-previously-felt-for-her (which I think was Sting's intent).

I think really good artists are often underestimated for knowing what the heck they are doing.

For example on Itanium2 I believe it can recognize when you're trying to extract an 8-bit chunk from a 64-bit register (such as when serializing an integer to a byte array), and replace your shifting/masking code with a single ""extr.u"" instruction.

The lesson learned is that keeping your code clear and idiomatic can not only make it better for human readers, but also better for the compiler.  In the above case, writing the byte extraction code in some strange ""optimized"" way may cause the compiler to get confused about what your code is really trying to accomplish, and it'll have to generate the shifts and masks instead of using the architecture-specific shortcut it knows about.

"politics","t5_2cneq","On this one small point, I'll grant that Hillary's plan is better.

Obama opposes a mandate because of what's going on in MA - it disproportionately negatively effects people who can't afford it. The MA plan hasn't succeeded in covering everyone, but they have put a burden on poor people. Which makes sense, and is a topic Hillary has steadfastly avoided giving details about.

The key goal of a mandate though isn't really making the poor pay for coverage (though they most need it). It's about making the healthy ones, young people like me, pay into the system when I might not otherwise because I have no health care needs to speak of. It makes it cheaper for everyone when everyone pays in.

But, quite honestly, both plans suck. Neither one is a plan for universal healthcare. It's not a mandate on the government to make sure individuals get healthcare; it's a mandate on individuals to do business with insurance companies - the single biggest reason our system is the disaster it is.

At best, either plan is just a stepping stone to real universal healthcare - both plans offer an expansion of ""government insurance"" that anyone can buy into, which is the important thing, because that's what will evolve into a real universal system.","1207104309"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Here's the paper that ""Op-ed"" was based on. It's clearly pro-voucher and makes a decent case regarding the flaws of the prior studies but doesn't do all that well establishing its own alternative as unambigiously better:

http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/14/ca/45.pdf

Here's Witte with a reasonably honest followup appraisal. He's clearly coming from a left-leaning anti-choice perspective, but not *nearly* as biased as the original reddit-featured article:

http://www.mediatransparency.org/reprints/milwaukee_voucher_experiment.htm

The Rouse paper was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics and can be found here:

http://www.nber.org/papers/w5964.pdf

I take G,P&amp;D as saying that even if the results were statistically equal, that would constitute a *triumph* for the choice program given the handicaps the initial batch of students who took the vouchers faced. Their initial math scores were well below that of public schoolers and their family income was much lower than average.

I take Witte as saying the problem with the ""natural experiment"" of rejects is: 
(1)  there just weren't *enough* rejects in the early years to make much of a sample space
(2) too many rejects dropped out of the study (over half!), and the ones who remained probably aren't a typical cross-section of the whole, and
(3) the performance of the rejects was **so** bad as to be suspicious. (In particular, he has a point that some of the math tests in the sample that scored ""1"", the minimum score, probably represented tests not seriously taken).

On the whole, the advocates on both sides have not convinced me that vouchers are unambiguously worse or better. Rather, they have convinced me that it's worth doing better studies and actually waiting to see what the studies **find** before trumpeting expected or perceived results. 

I agree with G,P&amp;D that the measure has to be *improvement*, not static scores, and I agree with Witte that you need large samples because the amount of turnover will make it tricky to tease out causation. So I have high hopes that the current study - once it actually reaches some conclusions - will add something meaningful to the debate.","1207104664"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I have come to realize and understand that at the worst moments in life when people have not a single ounce of strength and hope left in themselves, praying to a kind, benevolent god brings comfort and optimism more than logical, rational thinking. When an acquaintance dies, it is easy to be philosophical and scientific about the cycle of life. But when your own parent, sibling, or spouse is going through something very painful, most people find it more comforting to have faith and praise their respective deities than try to see it as a statistical certainty.

This is pretty much the biggest reason why you see agnostic and non-churchgoing people suddenly turn religious and attend Sunday morning prayers. They've had a personal trauma and thinking about god helped them fight it through and now they are just keeping the promises they made to god during the times of suffering.

While KO voiced his opinions on TV and helped this case tremendously, from the religious point of view, he can be regarded as the vehicle and not the originator, which of course in this case, is Jesus in the husband's mind. Can't blame him. Despite being an atheist myself, I'll pray to Jesus, Krishna, Allah, and Kali Ma for the rest of my life if my cousin wakes up from his 4-year-long coma and finishes his story about some girl he met but I was too busy to hear about.","1207104920"

A currency's ""value"" is **only** its relative value.  Ireland is under the Eurozone.  When the Dollar and Pound go down in value, it makes it more expensive for Americans and British to buy Euros.  Thus, the Euro gets ""stronger"". 

For an example, look at Japan.  Dollars are getting cheaper in Yen terms, but Euros are getting more expensive.  To America, the Yen is getting stronger, and to Europe the Yen is getting weaker.

I'm not downmodding your posts. I can provide a screenshot if you'd like. Also, while the NIH does get short-shafted, its not nearly as much as NASA. And while space travel itself might be its own commercial reward -- evidence has yet to prove otherwise (SpaceShipOne has already been retired, proving its not viable for commercial purposes) -- Drug companies already have a ""profit"" motive. Public funding actually decreases the motivation of drug research companies, as sometimes a drug developed with public funds is not exclusively patentable, meaning the companies private R&amp;D investment cannot be recouped. 

The point I was making is that while you think it is a good idea, drug companies have enough motivation to be benevolent, and instead choose to behave like a profit/loss bound company.

Current X-Prizes deal with the coming energy shortage -- the first 100mpg car that fits fours and has decent highway top speeds (85mph top speed, under 14 second 0-60 acceleration, I believe.)

Another good use of the X-Prize would be to combat the rising population problem in the third world. Afford technology like Playpumps that can be used to purify water or generate electricity for a village with little cost or effort, without regularly serviceable parts.

in my experience it always goes downhill after a while. the peak is there, but it fades away as more and more newfaggots flood the place. a board can only grow so fast before new people outnumber the ones that started it, helped build it, understand how it works.

PG wrote an article about trolling that contained some truth about what happens then: the people who started it just leave to a better place.

Their claims weren't even statistically *significant.* Rouse admits that even after she made up some numbers, she still couldn't get her p anywhere close to what it should be to say anything meaningful.

&gt;Rather, they have convinced me that it's worth doing better studies and actually waiting to see what the studies

And the voucher schools refused to participate in those studies, except when state law required it. And for about 15 years, the state let them off the hook, even as it expanded the program to 15,000 students.

&gt;actually waiting to see what the studies find

We know what the educational reality is today. After 20 years and half a *b*illion dollars, the voucher kids aren't doing any better than public school students. 

Anytime you observe behavior it changes. Maybe if we keep studying it long enough--finally putting some accountability on the voucher schools (some of whom had no curricula, books, college graduates, etc)--the results will change to what you want them to be. But in the meantime, we have to accept the facts: voucher kids do not perform any better on standardized tests than their peers in public school, but they're rewarded with higher grades.

&gt;On the whole, the advocates on both sides have not convinced me that vouchers are unambiguously worse or better.

By now, I hope you'd at least be convinced that doling out hundreds of millions in vouch er money without requiring even basic accountability from the schools is bad, bad public policy. Bad for taxpayers, bad for children. 

&gt;It's increasingly clear that a disturbing number of voucher schools are outright abominations.

&gt;An investigation this June by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found problems in some voucher schools that—even to those numb to educational horror stories—break one's heart. **No matter how severe one's criticisms of the Milwaukee Public Schools, nothing is as abysmal as the conditions at some voucher schools.** 

&gt;Overall, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel estimated that about 10 percent of the schools visited demonstrate ""alarming deficiencies"" without ""the ability, resources, knowledge or will to offer children even a mediocre education.""

&gt;That's a cautious estimate. First of all, reporters made pre-arranged visits, giving schools time to put their best faces forward. Second, nine of the program's 115 schools —an additional 8 percent—refused to allow reporters in. 

&gt;...Milwaukee's voucher schools are exempt from any number of guidelines, such as hiring certified teachers, testing students, or publicly releasing data on student achievement.

&gt;Alex's Academics of Excellence, for instance, operated under the public's radar screen until its founder was sentenced for tax fraud and it came to light he had previously been convicted of raping a woman at knifepoint. (The school closed last year after a raft of other problems, including two evictions, allegations that staff used drugs on school grounds, and an investigation by the district attorney's office.)

&gt;Carter's Christian Academy (K4–1) is described as ""essentially a small storefront building with a couple of tiny rooms redone as classrooms. ...There were no visible books or toys or paper."" The school's two teachers have high school diplomas, and the highest-paid teacher makes $8 an hour.

&gt;At Grace Christian Academy (K4–7), one staff member privately told reporters ""that there was no curriculum. Several classrooms were using worksheets downloaded from the Internet. ...There were few books or schools materials on [the] shelves or anywhere in sight."" In at least one case, the summary continued, ""the teacher was giving inaccurate scientific information to kids. [Principal Reginald] Armstrong says teachers use Biblical principles. He taught his class the story of Adam and Eve recently, from a literalist position."" Armstrong has a teaching license, but none of the other teachers do. 

http://www.rethinkingschools.org/special_reports/voucher_report/v_free201.shtml

The good people of Wisconsin forked over half a billion dollars for this, paid higher taxes for this, and in return, the state designed the program so that there was minimal accountability, and it was almost impossible to close even the school that got repeatedly evicted for not paying rent.","1207105421"

While it is true that the life of any President (and their family) is under more scrutiny than anyone else, they are also generally lawyers themselves who have the best lawyers in the country representing them.  They have multi-million dollar legal funds which are filled by ""concerned citizens.""

They know better.

Hillary and Bill weasel out of legal entanglements the same way Alberto Gonzalez does it: ""I cannot recall.""

It's a brilliant technique, which, when combined with a privileged attitude (Clinton, you remember, is the only person in the world who can simply refuse to respond to questions while under oath), works amazingly well.  Hillary played dumb, testifying only that she couldn't recall anything.  The only thing she could recall was that she had never seen or heard anything.

And the McDougals went to prison because they refused to answer questions relating to the Clinton's involvement.

I mean, when your friends are willing to go to jail for you and you have no long-term memory, you never get convicted of anything.

Bush/Cheney do this same shit, they're just more organized and systematic about it.

It's true.  Bill and Hillary have pretty clean hands after the investigation, but they were wiped clean by friends, lawyers, and faulty memory.  It's the same reason Cheney's hands are clean . . . because Scooter Libby's hands are dirty.

Hillary's life has been sanitized by silent friends like the McDougals, silent friends like Vince Foster, and a silent mind which can't remember events which happened in the past, but can remember events which never took place.  Bill has the added benefit of a couple of undisclosed settlements.","1207106169"

Which one has more evidence on its side is another question. There are cumulative reviews published that account evidence on both sides, and so far that's whats our public policy has been based on. Thus there is insufficient evidence to prove that cellphones cause cancer.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","They have completely different evolutionary origins, that's why they are different. Perhaps someone else can provide a better source than hearsay from my Persian friends, but Persians are Indo-Europeans and the two groups are closely related. Thus, Iranians are ""racially"" Caucasian. Even more, the language they speak (Farsi = Persian; Farsi != Arabic) is linguistically closer to French than it is to Arabic. 

Now I'm really entering the area of which I'm unsure (so if I'm wrong, someone correct me!), but Persia was was one of the world's first superpowers, and for centuries it was the only superpower in the region now known as the Middle East. This empire saw its zenith under Xerxes (think *300*, minus the hunchbacks and the naked women). The spread of Arabic culture and religion (Islam) came after the death of Mohammed (622 AD), and spread throughout the Middle East like wildfire. Thus, Persia ends up with its old language and race, but the ""Arabic"" religion/society. 

It was up until World War II that ""Persia"" was known by that name, and one of the leaders changed it to ""Iran"" because they actually wanted to show solidarity with Hitler and his ""Aryan"" movement. Before you go making crazy connections about both ""Aryan"" groups to the Jews, remember that Iran had been a colony of the ""Allied"" powers since the 1800s, and therefore their association with the Axis was purely an attempt to free themselves from that situation, and Iran's current issues with the  Jewish people are unrelated. Therefore, if your friend's family left Persia before it became Iran, it is likely that they would refer to themselves as ""Persian."" Also, many Persians do not want to associate themselves with the actions of the state of ""Iran,"" and so refer to themselves as Persian. Either is correct; it's all about how they feel on the issue. 

For a much more scientific look at the issue than mine, I definitely recommend [The Persian Puzzle](http://www.amazon.com/Persian-Puzzle-Conflict-Between-America/dp/0812973364/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1207106382&amp;sr=8-1).

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;&gt; The voucher program has been expanding. Ergo, the average kid in the program hasn't been in it for long.

&gt; I'm sure you wish that that were really an ""ergo."" But it's a combination of faulty logic and inaccurate information.

According to your link, in 2005 the limit had been around 15000, but was then increased to around 22050. That tells me that in 2008 *at least* 32% of the students entering 9th grade can't have been in voucher schools for more than two years continuously. That's a **huge** *minimum lower bound* on the degree of discontinuity; the actual number is larger still because every year some students will leave and be replaced with other new students. You can figure out that much *a priori* without needing the actual data. Hence, it is indeed an *ergo*.

What I glean from this *ergo* is that when you look at a control group and a matched test group and look at their initial scores, the test group's scores don't necessarily reflect much on the performance of their current schools. Some, just not all that much. Some of what you're measuring in the test group is the impact of *having recently switched to a voucher school* rather than the impact of *having attended one*.","1207106590"

It works fine, bit it will be limited in functionality until they can build a high-quality suite of applications and a development framework to go along with it.

For example, when developing a KDE application you don't just use QT, you use the KDE libraries and components so that all KDE applications share some major functionality. That's why Kate can use kioslaves to open and save files over the network and within archives. Konqueror can open them and thus so can every file open and save dialog.

That would only be true if the new vouchers were evenly distributed by grade. There is no  evidence of this, that I have seen. Do you have any actual data to back this up?

What if the vouchers tend to be given more to students in the lower grades? Children in the 9th grade with vouchers will have had them for many years. 

I seem to recall reading that new vouchers are given only to students in K-3...which would make any voucher-holding 9th grader a long time veteran of the system. I will try to find the source.

*******

Additionally, you're forgetting that **80% of the vouchers are going to children already in private schools.** In other words, they were in a voucher school already, it's just that the government took over paying for it.

Therefore, even if your thesis *were* correct (that 32% or more of 9th grade students were new to vouchers), the overwhelming majority of those would not be  new to voucher *schools.* 

Say 68% were ""old"" voucher students, 26% ""new"" voucher students but ""old"" students of the voucher school...that leaves only about 6% of the students to be new students to voucher schools. 

And this is *if* we accept your premise that vouchers will have been distributed evenly through the grades. (And not accounting for attrition of course).

"reddit.com","t5_6","Iceland's pretty cool, but it isn't very big. I went there on a business trip in 2001, so I was only there for about three days. Still, I got to see quite a lot. I took a bus tour and saw some hot springs, Þingvellir National Park where you can stand on two continental plates at once, and I learned how to find my way if lost in the Icelandic National Forest (it's an inside joke).

The whole country only has about 300,000 people, of which about 200,000 live in the Greater Reykjavik area. Reykjavik is a really nice city, with lots of night life and yes, beautiful, friendly women. The guys claim it's because their ancestors raided Ireland and only brought back the best looking girls. 

The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa not far from Reykjavik. To get there you have to go through some harsh looking lava fields, and if memory serves me right, you also pass by the Keflavik Naval Air Station, although I think that has been abandoned since 2006.

So all that was just in three days, I definitely wish I could have stayed longer, because there's more to see, and I didn't get to spend much time in any one place.

I guess I would say that someplace like Iceland would be a good choice, because you'll likely never have a good excuse to go there in normal life. A lot of other places you can go, like Paris, Rome, Barcelona - they're easier to justify because you have so much else to do nearby.

I went there because I was working for Ericsson, and we had a partnership with an Icelandic company, [Oz](http://oz.is). Plus it was at the peak of the dot com boom.

I was doing a lot of traveling in those days, and the flight there on Icelandic Air was the best ever. The plane was only half full, so I got three seats to myself! Plus I got to see the Northern Lights. Well, you can see those on the way to Sweden too.

Also, the food is kind of different, which to me is always a plus. Nothing worse than going someplace and feeling like you could have done the same thing at home. Mainly it's breakfast that's different. The hotels I stayed at in Sweden and Iceland always had really nice breakfast buffets, with the Nordic tables and the non-Nordic tables nicely separated.

And then there's Sweden: Stockholm, Gamla Stan, Uppsala... but that's another story.","1207107113"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Your *gasp* is well-timed; I did the exact same thing about a year ago. 

One thing that I think is interesting is that many people, even scholars (!) of Iran/Persia, often refer to Shia Muslims as being much more violent than their Sunni counterparts. It has its origins in the fact that the Sunni/Shia divide began shortly after the death of Mohamed, and the Shia candidate for next caliph was massacred. This supposedly led to a focus within the sect on violence and martyrdom. Even the source I looked up to back myself up mentions it: 

&gt;The massacre of Husayn still constitutes the defining moment in Shiite history. This loss established what Islam scholar John Esposito has called the ""paradigm of suffering and protest that has guided and inspired Shii Islam.""

Source: [about.com](http://terrorism.about.com/od/islampolitics/g/Shiite.htm)

I can't help but feel that this is a stereotypical view that lumps all Shiites into one category, but nevertheless, it's what *everyone* says about the Shiites. Ok, not everyone, but lots of people who are considered knowledgeable on the subject. So the current scholar's answer to your question would be ""no, the Shia don't harbor particular concerns that the West is anti-Shia, they just tend to be more resistant/violent/sacrificial as a group.""

I use it for playing MIDI keyboard.  It could adapt to a guitar with a MIDI pickup rather easily -which is why I'm going to be picking up a Roland pickup for my guitar pretty soon.

Only problem is you can't do bends and other interesting things you don't normally do with a piano.

I learned to play the music from tetris on it.  It's not bad, and it can load any MIDI file you can throw at it.

"programming","t5_2fwo","[Kant Generator Pro](http://www.barbalet.net/kant/), python version:

Hume tells us that our ideas are just as necessary as, in so far as this expounds the contradictory rules of our understanding, the Categories, since none of our faculties are a posteriori. As any dedicated reader can clearly see, it remains a mystery why our judgements constitute the whole content of natural causes. In natural theology, it must not be supposed that the Transcendental Deduction can thereby determine in its totality, irrespective of all empirical conditions, the Ideal, as is proven in the ontological manuals. The objects in space and time are a representation of the never-ending regress in the series of empirical conditions. For these reasons, our concepts are just as necessary as the transcendental unity of apperception, by virtue of pure reason. The Ideal can thereby determine in its totality, so regarded, philosophy, as is shown in the writings of Aristotle.
Our understanding, in so far as this expounds the practical rules of the things in themselves, abstracts from all content of a priori knowledge. Our faculties prove the validity of transcendental logic; in all theoretical sciences, pure logic stands in need of our a priori knowledge. In view of these considerations, to avoid all misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that our sense perceptions abstract from all content of a posteriori knowledge, by virtue of natural reason. As we have already seen, philosophy, indeed, exists in our sense perceptions. In all theoretical sciences, the reader should be careful to observe that the paralogisms of pure reason (and let us suppose that this is the case) constitute the whole content of general logic.","1207107949"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Medicare for all (aka socialized medicine) does appear on its surface to be the best plan. However, my understanding is that it will over time reduce physician reimbursements and consequently negatively affect quality and advancement of healthcare in the US. 

This happens because everyone will have the same government insurance and when the government decides to reduce its reimbursement for a particular procedure, doctors cant do anything about it. They can't reject patients with the government insurance because they'd be out of business with no patients to see. So, physicians either see their salaries decline or they work more hours to see extra patients to make up for the smaller reimbursement per procedure.

Now some would say doctors make enough anyway, but the reality is talented intelligent people go into fields where they can maximize earnings. If future physician salaries are not appealing, you'll get all best and brightest A students pursuing other more lucrative careers and being left with the mediocre B/C students going to med school. This will eventually lead to decreased quality of care and slowed medical progress.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The idea was that health insurance would only work when a lawsuit didn't make another party pick up the tab, avoiding double payment.  This is called subrogation, and some companies make their employees agree to it to get insurance.  

In principle, it's a good idea, since we generally don't need to carry enough insurance to pay for treatment twice.  But in practice, legal fees eat up much of the damages, and the injured employee may not end up with enough money to pay for treatment *once*.  This was apparently the case with the Shanks, and a kinder employer would have let her keep the insurance money, whatever the legal situation.

The Wall Street Journal [reported](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119551952474798582.html) this lawsuit in November 2007.  It's good to see it finally brought to a compassionate close, though likely only to stop the bad PR.","1207109743"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It's the exact same mentality.  If you're a fanboy, you're a fanboy: doesn't matter what you're a fanboy of.  I just think that if you try and claim that one is superior to the other you're automatically wrong.  But there's a difference between that and going: PCs have features that consoles will never have.  Conversely, consoles have features that PCs will never have, and you have to find an appropriate balance for you.  If that means one platform over the other or a mix, there's nothing wrong with that.  But most people like to think that their decision for their justification should be good enough for everyone else in the world: no matter whether circumstances are completely different for the others.

With most of today's games, I don't mind the wait.  The only game I've shelled full price out for lately is Brawl, which I got with a Wii at launch.  I definitely knew for a fact that I would want it that bad though, and I'm satisfied with my purchase.  A lot of people take riding the hype waves behind new games as if it automatically comes with the hobby... but I mostly like to wait for the dust to settle.  

But that's me.  Sometimes, when I hear people crap on the PC platform and say that it takes too much work etc, I get bothered and try to explain to them the virtues of the platform and the benefits it offers that consoles don't.  I don't do it because I need their opinion to match mine in order to validate my self esteem.  I just hate to see other people miss out on a great thing because they think it's going to be too much effort.  There's so much exciting stuff going on with PCs, it'd be a shame for any gamer to miss out on.","1207109764"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I've got a couple more suggestions while I'm at it.

First, there should be a way to determine how highly others have rated a story, other than by its position in the lists.  YouTube's method is a good start; showing the rating in the stars until you rate it yourself.  The problem with that is, once you rate something, you can no longer look at the overall rating it has.  I made a mockup of a way to show both at once:

http://www.zwebendesign.com/files/star-system.gif

My second (8th?) suggestion is not worth doing until the site gets popular, but something that I have wanted to see for a while on Digg and Reddit is the ability to edit story headlines.  This could be done two different ways.  First, you could leave the title open to editing by the submitter and rely on the submitter's interest in maintaining their reputation to stop them from abusing title edits.  I'm not sure if that level of trust is a good idea, but it would be a simple way to implement it.   The other way is harder but probably better, and that is to have a way to report inaccurate or poor titles, give the submitter a chance to change the title once several people report it, and have the users who reported the title indicate whether or not the edited title is better.

I think that's enough suggestions for now, thanks for taking the time to consider them.","1207109992"

1) it can get you arrested for using or posessing it.  Therefore it is not legally safe.
2) Despite claims to the contrary it is addictive.  Therefore it also leads to behaviour common to other flavours of drug addict (like violent crime to get money to fund the next high).  
3) Despite claims to the contrary it has negative health consequences, in particular effects to the brain and lungs from long term use.  It is medically unsafe (if it was medically safe it couldn't be a psycho-active agent and wouldn't be used to get high).

4) It makes you try to justify this illegal and unsafe substance to random strangers on the internet.

Further, if you choose to read the Darwin fish negatively, as is your right, I would like you to know that I view your fish equally as offensive. Since you seem to enjoy lumping people together by how they decorate their vehicle, you're defending people who often have, ""Real Men Love Jesus"" or controversial quotes from the Old Testament which clearly contradict the teaching of Christ (specifically Leviticus 20:13). Where I am from, a lot of these people have Confederate flags and racist/sexist bumper stickers. Seeing as you cannot take the messages separately, let's just lump them all together too. So yeah, your fish, to me, says that you are a hateful bigoted closed minded ignorant prick... mind you I'm being facetious.

In my opinion, and this is where I take a strange turn, you're right. The Darwin Fish does have an air of superiority. So does your Christ Fish.

Isn't that the entire point of putting stuff on your car, though? ;-)

That's a mischaracterization, I don't believe that. Live and let live. Everyone is free to form their own opinion; and if it reflects a different view, fine. In this particular case (the Darwin fish), it is not because it is in disagreement with the Jesus fish that I see it as being hateful. I see it as hateful because it is rude. It's just rude to take someone else's religious symbol to mock it or disrespect it. And that is what is happening with the Darwin evolve fish, it is mocking a religious symbol, in this case a Christian symbol, to make the point that Christians need to evolve.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","That reminds me of a story told in one of my Physics textbooks.

The author was investigating the old tale of circus performers who performed a trick of dipping their fingers into molten lead. His theory was that the fingers were wet and the instant vaporisation of the surface of water in contact with the lead insulates the finger from the bulk of the heat of the lead.

He did a lot of pondering about the problem before he set about doing it himself. He realised that one of the most important things is to get the temperature of the molten lead just right - too cool and the lead would harden around his finger.

So he made himself a pot of lead, brought it to just the right temperature, and with divine willpower he did the unthinkable - he wet his hand and plunged his finger into the lead. He withdrew it immediately and it was unscathed.

Amazed, he did it several times more, each time it became easier for him to get past the mental block that kept him from wanting to stick his finger in.

But curiosity got the better of this professor, and he wondered if he was not just fooling himself about the water - perhaps he could do it just fine without the water? And so he dried off his hand, plunged his finger in the lead, and immediately felt the intense pain of the severe burning of his skin.

It was only afterwards that he realised that the experiment could have been tested by using a sausage, rather than his own finger.","1207111689"

if your life really sucks that much were you need to escape all the time and rather not improve it, thats a shame. i guess thats all i'm trying to get it.

Armed struggle is clearly the implied meaning in the Qur'an in IV 95 (which I quoted in another post) and in IX 41,81,88 and LXVI 9.

"reddit.com","t5_6","As it happens, I've been to Japan too! I loved Japan, but then I've loved pretty much every country I've visited.

This was back in 1983, back when you could get about ¥250 for a dollar. I had a friend teaching English in Takamatsu on Shikoku, the smallest of the four islands. I stayed there for three weeks, so I bought a Rail Pass which allows you to travel all over the country without having to worry about coming up with fare all the time.

Language isn't a big problem, but I'm pretty good with languages so I spent an intense 4 months learning as much as I could, and even being able to read kana and some important characters in the train schedule.

I started in Tokyo, of course. Rode the bus in from Narita International - a Blade Runner moment if ever I've had one. I had been to New York City, but Tokyo was a whole other world. Everything from the airport to the city was three to five stories, and the motorway was some kind of multilevel thing which soared above all of that. I remember how when it finally reached Tokyo, it made a huge curve, so you could see where you had been and where you were going.

That night I had my first taste of Japanese tv - it was as crazy back then as it is now, but there wasn't a Youtube. I remember some guy wearing a floppy airplane suit jumping into some water. And then there were the bats - MY GOD THE BATS!

No... that was another trip.

Anyway, looking back, I think I visited too many temples. They have a crapload of temples and they're all beautiful and they're all different, but you can get tired of them after a while. A lot of beautiful parks too, I didn't get tired of those.

One thing I liked was feeling like a rockstar, especially in the lesser traveled places. I don't know if they do that anymore, but back then a tall blond Gaijin was a big deal to the kids. There was an elementary school class on a field trip when I took a ferry to Shikoku, and once they saw me they immediately ran to surround me and ask questions. They only spoke Japanese, but they knew who Jioju Uashinguton and Aburahamu Rincorn were.

Japan would be a good choice too, because it's _so_ different, it would open up your mind about the world. When you get back, you're like ""OMG it's so green here! And there's so much open space! And people have different kinds and colors of hair!""

But $500? Well, maybe you could stay in a youth hostel as suggested here http://www.43things.com/entries/view/551481. And if you eat mostly at cheap curry counters and okinomyaki places you might make it.

I think I spent something like $1700 for three weeks 25 years ago. But that was with a lot of travelling, mostly staying in a different place every night, eating some pretty good food, and it included the airfare.

Agreed, but you seem to imply that the word 'Jihad' is, nowadays, **solely** used to imply armed struggle. That is not the case, although it is more usually meant to be used in that way, but that's because armed struggle is covered more in the media these days.

For example, good, hard-working students are referred to as 'mujtahideen' in schools.

Your link is to an article by a leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, who are even more radical than Hamas and Hizbollah. The latter can argue that they are fighting a foreign entity occupying their land, while the former can't.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Firstly, I *am* a ""law abiding drug-free citizen"", and I think pot should be legal.  I'll give you a moment to wrap your mind around that.

Now,

1) Legality and safety are orthogonal concepts.  Irrelevant.

2) Citation needed, particularly on the ""violent crime"" aspect with regard to marijuana.  Laughable.

3) The *only* proven part of this is lung damage, and pot is less impactful than tobacco (which is considered ""safe enough"" to be legal).  Furthermore, pot can be ingested in other ways e.g. eating, which negates your argument entirely.  Weak.

4) Circular, and not worth responding to.

Regarding ""explain why it was made illegal in the first place"", I'd be interested to know your thoughts around alcohol, the fact that it's proven much more harmful to individuals and society than marijuana, and the fact that it has been illegal in the past.  Was it ""unsafe"" during the 1920s, but now it's ""safe""?

One final question: your comment ""if it was medically safe it couldn't be a psycho-active agent and wouldn't be used to get high"".  Are you implying that all psycho-active agents that people use to get high are not ""medically safe""?

The dumbass black lady, I forget her name, said that Wright had done a lot of good things for the community, so that should offset whatever he said especially since what he said was taken out of context - that's what Hasselbeck was responding to. So yeah, it's still stupid.

But while we're correcting misperceptions, Wright wasn't saying ""Goddamn America"" from an egotistical anger standpoint, he was saying it from a Righteous Anger standpoint. He was equating the blessedness of America with the blessedness of the Chosen People in the eyes of God. When they fell out of God's grace by not holding to the Covenant, they were damned by God. And so America, chosen and blessed as many believe, was damned because of her sins, according to the logic of Biblical theology, not according to Reverend Wright's opinion.

I'm sure you all knew that already, this is just in case you didn't. I'm an atheist, btw, but I still think that if most Christians measured Wright's statements with their own internal logic, they would agree with him in the end.

I wasn't saying that you couldn't feasibly, or even frequently, introduce elements of learning and experience into a game, but to say that games should be, at their core, coercing you into developing a skill for real life is bizarre, and quite contradictory to the very idea of *a game*.  My bring up a fictional book was to show that not everything that's enjoyable in life has its tangible counterpart in real life.  You don't learn a lot from reading entertaining fiction, at least not things that you could actively use in real life.  What you do get is an enjoyable experience, learning or no learning.  

&gt;if your life really sucks that much were you need to escape all the time and rather not improve it, thats a shame. i guess thats all i'm trying to get it.

I guess if your life really sucks so much that you have to
(choose one):

-Read
-Watch Movies
-Watch Sports
-Watch TV

to escape rather than ""improving your life"", that's a shame.  

Honestly?  Since when does someone need to be constantly improving their life?  What happened to being content or happy with where you are and what you're doing?  Whatever happened to escaping for the pure enjoyment *of escape*, even if you could be doing something ""more productive""?  ","1207114277"

However, to say that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is more radical than Hamas and Hizbollah is an anachronism.

Before Hamas and Hizbollah existed, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt was indeed radically militant, but they changed direction long ago, and are now one of the least militant, most moderating of Islamist movements.  Egypt's ""Islamic Jihad"" was partly a reaction to the Brotherhood's moderation.  That organization was merged into Al Qaeda in 1998 by its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri.

Other ""Muslim Brotherhood"" organizations that were inspired by the original in Egypt remained militant after the Egyptian organization changed direction.  One of those was Syria's Muslim Brotherhood, that battled Hafez Assad and lost in Hama in 1982.","1207114880"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Remind them that states do have the right to oppose unconstitutional federal edicts. In fact, I would go further than that – remind them that they are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and thus that they are obligated to oppose its violation.

You idiot, you HAVE won.

Now shut the hell up and let the DHS slowly retreat while maintaining political face before they change their minds and start fighting again.  What, are you expecting some kind of massive public *mea culpa*?  It's not going to happen.

The states pressed the issue and they won.  At the point the government backed down on its (ridiculous) threats to ban entire states from flying, the states *won.*  There was nothing else the government could do or threaten.

And then it will quietly die, once no one remembers it was there to begin with, so that no one has to be embarassed.
