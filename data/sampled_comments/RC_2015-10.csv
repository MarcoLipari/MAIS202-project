It's sad that there is even a leaderboard where you can have someone in 1st spot who gets a rift filled with zombies and clears a 73. Then you get someone who clears a 70 but with ghosts or WA. The 70 GR would be much harder to finish, but with skill would be possible. It would also require far more skill than the ""Higher"" 73 that had zombies.

If there is going to be different monster types, then have them across all difficulties. There shouldn't be ""easy"" GR. They should all be nearly impossible at the high levels and should ONLY be able to be beaten with skill, not lucky map/mob/pylon rifts.

How can you even have a leader board that is supposed to dictate ""skill"" when the actual difficulty is so ridiculously skewed that it's impossible to actually gauge whether or not one person is actually better than the other, or just lucky.

I think RNG is great, but it has no place anywhere near something that has a ""leaderboard"". Especially when completing high GR is basically 90% luck, and 10% skill.","1443657600"

Additionally, if Derrick Henry can go man-mode like he has in several big games past, easing the load on Coker and allowing us to limit turnovers/stay conservative... we'll be ok.

We'll see. I agree that our defense will step up, potentially forcing some turnovers. My optimistic prediction is Bama 31 UGA 27.","1443657603"
"flicks","t5_2uiee","Consider the few performances that each of these actors *did* leave behind. 

In *East of Eden*, James Dean helped usher Method acting into American cinema, which makes it one of the most important and influential performances of all time (in my mind, it's right up there with Brando in *On The Waterfront*). *Giant* and *Rebel Without a Cause* may not be as monumental, but they're still solid performances in highly-regarded films, and *Rebel* is absolutely iconic.

Heath Ledger gave an Oscar-worthy performance in *Brokeback Mountain*, which was largely ignored because of its subject content (does anybody actually think that *Crash* was the better film, much less the best film of 2005)? And his role as the Joker would have been absolutely worshipped regardless of whether or not he had died because it's an incredible performance. All circle-jerking aside, he disappeared into that role and gave one of the great Method performances of the 21st century.

And River Phoenix was arguably the *most* talented of these three actors. In his short career, he worked with some of the most iconic directors of the time: Rob Reiner, Peter Weir, Sidney Lumet, Steven Spielberg, Gus Van Sant, etc. *Stand By Me* and *Running On Empty* are two of the greatest teen performances ever, and *Dogfight* and *My Own Private Idaho* are great adult performances in their own right. I personally believe that River was a better actor than Joaquin, who is one of the best actors of his generation, and it's an absolute tragedy that he was never allowed to fully come-of-age as an actor.","1443657603"

A big suggestion I have with playing Lakers, specifically, is to control your PF on defense.  Don't worry about defending Julius Randle outside of the paint.  Just stay aware of him slashing to the basket if paint is otherwise open.  That way your PF can freelance as defensive help in protecting the paint.

I hated being forced into physical contact with relatives when I was little.  It was insincere and made me feel like I didn't have the right to say no.   

If you don't allow your grandkid to say 'no' to grandma's kisses, if grandma decides to molest said grandkid, they will not feel you have their back.  

Theoretically, most grandmas are not child-rapists.  But if you are molested, it's most likely to be by a family member.

Usually with kissing grandma, having discussions and adults being willing to let children not be forced into physical contact solves this issue without police.  Many kiss-with-grandma cases would never go to trial.  But the principle is the same.  Don't touch people until you get consent.  Unless you join a conga line where it's expected the next person who joins the line will rest hands on your shoulders or waist.

""Ruining the moment"" is not worse than someone getting kissed, or groped against their will.

"Windows10","t5_2u9xs","I couldn't tell you a tutorial for it but perhaps /u/danskeman knows of one.

A system image will make a complete copy of everything on the drive that you tell it to, so you could restore from that and it would be just like it was prior to a boffo.  So what I meant was that if you do revert back to 8.1 then do a system image while in there as a precautionary measure then try to upgrade to 10 again and see if it worked out any better, and in case of a catastrophe you'd have the system image if you needed to reinstall it due to not being able to revert to 8.1  Of course this assumes that reverting works out for you and 8.1 is the same as you left it prior to upgrading.

As far as I understand, when you do a system image it is of the whole shebang, so you can't just pick out pieces of it to restore, it's sort of all or nothing when you use a system image to restore.

Hang in there for danskeman he's seems quite knowledgeable about how to do all this.  Personally I tend to fly on the seat of my pants on my own computers unless they are my business computer.","1443657604"

*A camera is placed inside a dingy hotel, it seems to be day outside, and the camera reveals Stephen Romero sitting on his bed, he seems to have just woken up, despite it being 12:30 in the afternoon*

**Romero:** Ugh, fuck, i should've cut that promo on Barker earlier than i did, damnit, why did i do that at 3 in the morning?

*Romero takes a swig of Dr. Pepper to help himself stay awake*

**Romero:** Alright, it seems to be recommended to give some time out of my precious day, to talk about the rest of the scum and idiots in this tournament, and not just Barker, ugh.

*Romero clutches his head, seemingly having a headache*

**Romero:** Fuck this sucks, but anyway, i guess i might as well start, and who better to start with, than with my fellow Stephen, Stephen Alexandria, Ah, here we see a sad, sad man, who got took out by his buddy Jack Anchor, and it seems that messed him up in the head with he talks about him self, bragging about how he fucked my mom and impregnated her with me, despite only being two years older than me, saying over and over that he's the most over person on the roster, and all that bullshit, well little Stevie, if you want to see someone who's truly the most over person on the roster, someone's who's truly as great at wrestling as he says he is? Well look no further than yours truly, 'cause you sure as hell can't find either of those in yourself.

*Romero takes another swig of Dr. Pepper, before going back to his list*

**Romero:** Alright, who's next, ah! Brian Sunrays! Our first WIR champion, and a man who's done jack shit since, tell me something Ivan Stingray, what exactly makes you a threat? You lost your world title to Sonny Carson, SONNY CARSON, someone who i can beat by lightly hitting with a wooden broom, and not only that, but you lost on a goddamn backslide, who loses to A GODDAMN BACKSLIDE, i'l tell you who Nivan Ingday, losers, complete and utter losers, and then you got your legs crushed by Nolan Hawk, and then when you came back you didn't even bother going after him, because you know you had already peaked after the end of that world title tournament, and quite simply couldn't go and do what you used to do anymore, England Rinrey, i'll tell you straight, i don't take you seriously, and i'll be very happy to meet you in the second round should you somehow win, because all that means is an easy win, over a former champion who quite simply doesn't have it anymore. 

*Romero takes yet another swig of Dr. Pepper, before once again, going back to his list*

**Romero:** All right, who's next, oh! Conan O'Brien, Someone who's been driven to panic and desperation by someone who for some reason gave enough shits about her to stalk her. To be quite honest, i hope you never find this person because it will be hilarious when you finally have a full-on mental breakdown, but then again, you're a women, you have mental breakdowns every other minute, and also, i'm never going to believe you own half of Africa, that's just plain absurd and the day you do is the day we switch bodies and i end up as a tiny irish women, well that did happen once before, but i'd prefer not to talk about that.

*Romero pauses, and his eyes breifly widen as if he's having flashbacks, before taking a swig of Dr. Pepper, and continuing on.*

**Romero:** Alright who's next, John Hall? Who the fuck is this guy? *gets on his laptop and looks him up* Oh, he's a generic hardcore wrestler, heh, i bet he's also a bland, technical/high-flying wrestler like everyone else around here, mate, i don't know much about you, but i do know that you better stay out of my way.

*Romero goes to take a swig of Dr. Pepper, but realizes it's empty, and angrily throws it out the window, hitting an old lady in the head with it*

**Romero:** Oh shit! I should've recycled that! but anyway, who's next, ahhhh, Labrador Cyregjrsdfgdfbhdrfshdtgfx, Uh, fucking preachers, hate them, they sit you down, and bore you by talking about nothing for like 15 hours or so, and then they fuck off to one of their 10 different affairs with underaged women after preaching about morality for 10 days straight, fuckin' hypocrites, at least he hit Lucian with his bible while Lucian was trying to pull me off of Barker, so i hate him *slightly* less than the other people in this tournament.

*Outside of Romero's window, paramedics arrive for the old lady he knocked out*

**Romero:** Oh No! I forgot to get my other Dr. Peppers out my Car, Hold on!

*Romero rushes out to his car, and comes back with a 12 pack of Dr. Pepper*

**Romero:** Anyway, who's next here, hmm, Santino Margenex, You know Santino, i really fucking hate you, almost as much as Barker, you go around saying god this and god that, when you haven't won a single god damn match, and then you had to bring in two random cronies to increase your chances of winning a match from .000000000000000000000000000000000000001% to .000000000000000000001%, and not to mention you thinking you're all hard and shit, when you grew up upper-class, mate if you grow up upper-class, don't fuck it up by getting arrested, and if you do, don't claim you know the lives of people like me just because you served one damn sentence, i can't even fucking remember how many times i've gotten arrested ,or how many times i got away with shit, so sit down and shut the fuck up.

*Romero cracks open another Dr. Pepper, and takes another swig before going back to his list*

**Romero:** Alright, what other jabroni's do we have left, ahhh, Bobert Peacelord, yet another case of a washed-up champion, you whine endlessly about getting screwed by the powers that be, but let me tell you something, there are no powers, you're just too stupid to not get hit in the head with a chair, you should've learned long, long ago, how to avoid getting screwed, but no, you keep falling for it, and then blaming other people, has it ever crossed your mind Bobert that you just suck? Think about it for a moment.

*Romero proceeds to down his 2nd Dr. Pepper in one go before expertly throwing it in the recycle several flights down*

**Romero:** Alright, let's see here, oh! Blandy Reese's Pieces! First of all, i just gave you a wonderful endorsment deal, don't pass it up, but back to ranting on how you suck and how i'm better than you, Blandy, what exactly have you done since coming to WIR?please, tell me, because i can't remember a god damn thing, and that's all i need to tell you, having nothing to say about someone is much worse than having a lot to say about someone.

*A loud knock is heard on Romero's door, and Romero goes to open it, and then closes it instantly, and heads back to his bed seemingly shocked by what he saw*

**Romero:** Ugh, fuckin' nudists, anyway speaking of dicks, let's talk about Tunny LaLarson, the third case of a washed up champion, Tunny, have you ever won without someone holding your hand? Or without bullshit by yourself? Because i don't think you have in a year, Mate, i'd beat you in half a second with no one to guide you through how to run the ropes, or how to perform a bodyslam, or giving you a cane, You're a bad wrestler, and you might as well retire because you're never seeing that world title ever again.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Gotta completely disagree on this. In Dota if your hero lacks mobility you can buy it, while Flash in LoL having a 5 minute cooldown with a fraction of Blink Dagger's range doesn't exactly shore up a hero's lack of mobility. The fact that Sven and Ursa buy Blink Dagger isn't a problem with the heroes, and the heroes aren't completely useless.

The absence of turn rates in LoL allows ranged carries to orbwalk BACKWARDS, retreating while shooting the targets that are chasing at the same time, and combined with how much damage AD carries actually deal when they get their shots off in LoL, melee carries without gapclosers are really fucking useless because they can never catch their targets and they just die.

Now imagine if turn rates didn't exist in Dota. The effect wouldn't be as great in LoL because Blink Dagger exists, but saying turn rates contribute ""very little"" to balance is just downright wrong. Carries with long range like Drow Ranger would be somewhat ridiculous and even non-hard carry heroes with long range like QoP would be ridiculously strong if they could kite you while getting free rightclicks on you the whole time (and in QoP's case she can Blink backwards and repeat if you keep chasing). Ranged supports as a whole would be significantly stronger if they could deal rightclick damage while retreating (e.g. AA, Dazzle, etc)","1443657608"

Especially since single occupancy vehicles are only most efficient for some specific parts of commutes, and the backbone should be built on rail that can transport hundreds of thousands of people an hour. It'd be great to have an integrated system that allows you to put in a destination into your smart device, automatically call up a self driving car that will transfer you to high occupancy transit, and have another car waiting for you to take you the last mile, the same way many people currently use cab hailing apps.

I enjoy playing Irelia jungle, but it just takes so long to become effective. Devourer scales great though. You'll be a wrecking ball with it and one other damage item (trinity or botrk). 

I don't think I would get warrior on her though. It's just too mediocre to invest in. I'd rather go ranger's trailblazer straight into trinity if I wasn't going to get devourer. Warrior might be better for early ganks, but it's just a money hole. Devourer pays dividends later on, so I still think it's a decent pickup. ","1443657611"

"pkmntcg","t5_2s9kv","If you want to play Crushing Hammer instead of Enhanced Hammer, you should just play the Crushing Hammer in the first place.

It puts your opponent in an awkward position to even ask for a take back. There's a lot of people in the TCG community with a lot of social and self confidence issues that are just waiting to be walked over. I know a lot of people in this game that would let an opponent take back a move because they have confidence issues with confrontation or uncomfortable situations, even when they wouldn't want to let a move be taken back by their opponent. I don't think it's good to be that guy that is making other person's tournament experiences worse.

If you make a mistake, make a mental note to not make that the next time, accept it, and move on. If you take responsibility of the mistakes you make, then you will be less likely to make them in the future. The people that continuously make mistakes and ask for take backs tend to not learn or correct their mistakes and just get salty when someone later doesn't let them take that back and because of getting salty they don't learn and make corrections based on that mistake.

From the other side, of the person allowing take backs, it's important to remember just because you let someone take something back, they aren't obligated to let you take back a mistake later. There are many people in this game that ask people for take backs to gain an edge and cover for their sloppy play while at the same time denying their opponent to take back stuff.","1443657611"

Trump’s stupidity is not an object of circlejerking on reddit. 

Trump is a psychopath with a certain rakish charm. He will, obviously, never be the POTUS.

Sanders is an earnest outsider with a certain quixotic charm. He will, obviously, never be the POTUS.

On reddit, Sanders might be the beneficiary of the same type of clueless youthful exuberance as Ron Paul once was, but they are nothing alike. (Full disclosure: I am a Norwegian who tends to vote center-right, which, by American standards makes me an extreme leftist pinko commie bastard.) Ron Paul is a batshit libertarian, whilst Sanders is a moderate social democrat. As a Norwegian, I have been under the yoke of social democracy for most of my life, and, while it is sometimes irksome in its prescriptiveness towards social affairs, it is mostly quite agreeable.

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","It was a tedious process for us, and this is just the way we did it. 

You would start with ""take it"", he takes it, say ""hold it"", put your hand right out and let him drop it into your hand. 

Then it's a matter of slowly -- really slowly -- delaying when you put your hand out. Like start with increments of 0.5 seconds. He takes it, you say hold it, wait half a second and then put your hand out. Do that a few times and then try 1 second. 

You gotta work in real small increments so that you set him up for success. If you start with waiting like 5 seconds, he won't pick it up.

Once you've got him up to a few seconds, you can teach ""give it"" by saying the command after the can hits your hand (if you aren't already doing that). 

You may not need to wait till he has a small hold; it just might be confusing to rapid fire three commands at once at that stage. ","1443657614"

These figures are as of 2014, and are in 2014 dollars.

Under Paul Martin as PM, total program spending increased $231 dollars per capita, compared to Harper's $66 per capita.

He increased transfer payments by $177 per capita, compared to Harper's $32 per capita.

As for increases in direct spending, Martin was $54 per capita compared to Harper at $34 per capita.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt; Question 1 – Is the above actually true for all (or nearly all) of Blue Pill advocates? Or do some Blue Pill people believe that The Red Pill is inherently wrong, abusive, immoral, etc., by its very nature, and that even if both parties consent to the relationship, it is not an appropriate relationship to have under any circumstance?


sure, if both consent, i guess that's fine (within reason, of course). i don't think of traditional relationships and TRP relationships as the same thing, but if someone willingly participates in either... well, good for them i guess. i'll still have my opinion of those relationships, but i don't believe that the participants shouldn't be able to make their own decisions when fully informed. 

&gt; Question 2 – Does a clear power disparity, if present, change whether a Red Pill relationship is appropriate? Does it shed doubt on a woman’s genuine consent to the style/boundaries of the relationship?


same as above; if she's fully aware of the man's mindset and how he plans to treat her and stays in the relationship, i have no reason to doubt her decision. it seems to me that TRP is meant to be surreptitious and undetected, though, so i'm not sure this is really a fair question. 

&gt; Question 3 – Does the man’s choice to unilaterally make changes based on his own wants/happiness affect the answers to questions 1 and 2 above? Has he pulled an unfair bait-and-switch? If a woman chooses to remain in the relationship anyway, would her actual consent to the new style/boundaries of the relationship the man is pursuing be in doubt?


if you change without telling your partner, especially if you change drastically, that's pretty unfair (something i'm sure TRPers would agree with, were the roles reversed). i don't know that i'd doubt her consent, in this case, but i would be curious about her motivations for continuing to remain in such a situation. it gets abusive, fast, and it's not uncommon for someone to stay with an abusive partner in the hopes that they will change or improve. 

&gt; Question 4 – Does a man’s secrecy about The Red Pill affect the answers to any of questions 1 through 3 above? More specifically, if the woman in question knew about The Red Pill, and she would never have gotten involved with the man if she knew, but she otherwise genuinely loves the man, how he looks, how he acts -- everything else about him -- is her consent to the relationship invalid due to the man's enormous secret?


really, i think only she can decide to stay or leave (consent or withdraw). i don't think anyone can make or consider that consent invalid except the consenting individual. i'd think along the same lines of my answer to #3 though. ","1443657617"

My boyfriend left almost a month ago to pursue his dream, committing to the Peace Corps for a two year stint in Cameroon, Africa. So believe me, I understand what you're going through!

First and foremost embrace, embrace, embrace that end date and your future plans. That will keep you going when you lose hope. 

Somehow communication works out even like it feels it won't. Going from texting and talking on the phone nonstop to not being able to talk for three or so days between traveling and him setting up his phone was a harsh switch. Now we're able to talk on the phone about 30 minutes every day. I still miss like crazy not being able to text him every minute but those phone calls are so wonderful and actually do become enough. I'm not sure what your time zone difference will be but I'm at 6 hours and that makes communication the most difficult. I send emails or messages that I know he won't see for a while if I have something I need to share immediately or just want to share more details of things we didn't have time to discuss on the phone.

My piece of advice is to set, remember, and meet your own goals. It's easy to feel when our boyfriends are going on their huge adventures that we are kind of inadequate/aren't living up to our full potential. I'm still working on this but try to remember why that wasn't your own dream and what we want to work on when they're gone and even when they come back. 

Finally, don't feel guilty about being sad or if you feel any resentment. That's normal. Enjoy the moments you share now but sometimes crying really helps and let's you get to enjoy the moment more than trying to bottle up your emotions. Same with when he leaves, give yourself some time to wallow. It is going to be a very tough day. But then again, we're here for you. On that day my bf left one of the best pieces of advice to get through that pain was from someone on here. The person told me that my bf was incredible and selfless for doing what he's doing and he obviously wants me here when he gets back or he would have broken up with me which probably would have been easiest on him too. Your timeline is much shorter (feel lucky about that too!!!) but I want you to know the same, your bf is amazing for doing this!! How many people want to study in Antarctica?! He's doing this for himself but he wants you there through it and to be there when he comes back.

It will get easier!!  ","1443657618"

School is not for every one so don't feel like you have to get a college degree.  You can still get a skill that employers want and are willing to pay for without a degree.  The trick is to get a skill and yes, that will probably require some training and that could be school, could not be.  Will this government job provide you with a training for a skill? You mentioned in other posts that you'd get a degree in accounting or finance, why those subjects?  Does number crunching and word problems interest you?  To be honest, I don't often hear people who say they HATE school become accountants.

On a Foo Fighters related side note, guitarist Chris Shiflett has a podcast called ""Walking the Floor."" He mainly interviews musicians (mostly country/folk related), and there's a lot of good insight on music industry and history in those interviews. Quite a few of his guests are prominent guitarists (ie. Redd Volkaert, Brad Paisley, among others) and he'll usually get them talk to about playing styles, gear, influences, etc. Worth a listen if you liked Sonic Highways.

And that movie was just about regular caving - I think if they made a movie about cave diving, I'd be scared to even watch it. 

And haha, totally, re: the catacombs - I saw that horror movie about them last year and it was like Disneyland compared to ""The Descent"".

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","That's a good question, I think she needed to be in the Avatar State to channel Aang's knowledge to give everyone their bending back.    

However I think that the Lion Turtle in Atla gave Aang energybending and so the Avatar will have that ability from now on. Korra is the start of the new 5 element cycle that was thrust upon Aang. 
  
So I think that Korra can energybend, but I'm not sure if she knows how to use it. I imagine she probably retains some experience from the time she used it in the Avatar State since she presumably performed it a number of times in a row, but she was in the Avatar State and I don't know if they (Avatars) can learn techniques passively while channeling them (past lives) like that.","1443657625"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Absolutely nothing in the game needs full Vitality right side. While leveling you will probably want to balance both. You should practice using your cooldowns, so you can learn where they are needed and where they are not. Why you will probably want to have a bit of both on the right side is because in addition to being new to the game, you won't get your tank stance until you are level 40 (because you're a Paladin). This means you will be taking more damage, and have a harder time holding aggro. Vitality will help you survive while you learn when to use cooldowns, and Strength will help you hold aggro. Make sure you keep your weapon up to date as well. As you progress towards endgame, you can drop more of the right side Vitality accessories in favor of Strength accessories. When you'll do this depends on how comfortable you are with the fights you are running, and your class in general.

When you have a choice on the secondary stats, never choose the one with Parry. Skills that increase Parry chance are solid (Dark Dance, Raw Intuition) but the amount granted from your gear is so little that it's not worth it at all. Accuracy is useless until current endgame content, but once you reach that point, you HAVE to meet the cap. Skill Speed is similar to Accuracy in that you will want to meet a cap (The current opener favored by a lot of endgame Warriors requires a certain amount), but it is a lot less useful beyond that point. Also, iLevel trumps all; weapon damage and primary stats (STR, DEX, INT) are weighted so much higher than secondaries that you will always want the new piece of gear. Beyond those details, Crit&gt;Det&gt;SS.","1443657625"

They're not the same thing. Tolerance is necessary, acceptance is personal.

""gay people are free to do as they please"" is different from ""being gay is totally cool""

One is necessary, the other is just preferable.

You also conflate ""racist jokes"" with actual racism.

To me, this may say more about you than you may wish. I'm of the opinion that when EVERYONE can be the subject of jokes, we'll have accomplished something.

What do I mean?

In the UK, we mock each other. The North and South exchange insults, the nations exchange insults even different areas in the same towns exchange insults.

Sometimes it's nasty. When done by nasty individuals.

Most of the time it's not only benign, it's an expression of affection and shared heritage.

The Irish and the English can throw around banter, insult each other's nations, accent or (perceived general) appearance. When I was a boy, Irish terrorists were blowing up buildings, sectarian violence was rife and some of the Irish people I know tell of being treated with great suspicion and even antagonism.

I for one think that being free to mock each other is part of what helps mend these rifts.

To allude to America, when Chris Rock makes *extremely* prejudicial jokes, no body can possible assume malice. What they can do is laugh at themselves, laugh at the problems and maybe come to understand those problems a little better.","1443657629"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Having your body develop quickly but your interests develop slowly sucks.  That certainly describes me at 14.  It's worth remembering that just a few generations ago a 14 year old kid would have been playing with dolls.  Being into drawing horses and watching stupid television is **not** a problem. I understand it may fit into the same pattern of seeming ""young"", but they are **taste** choices you need to respect.  If you forbid her from harmless expression of herself, you're just taking away her autonomy more -- and what she needs is to grow up and actually develop autonomy. (This doesn't mean you should give her free reign to do things that are actively harmful to others: force her to shower, punish her for using your things without permission, etc.)

It seems like she needs to be put in a situation where she needs to show competence, and where someone (not you; you've got enough on your plate) is there to help her and hold her feet to the fire and not let her panic and leave.  Maybe it's going camping with a group, or volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, or building a backyard treehouse.  Some activity where it's guaranteed that something will go wrong, but also where it will be within her competence (with help) to fix it.  Basically, exposure therapy for her fear of things going wrong.","1443657631"

Try this, do something helpful for someone who can't pay you back. Maybe you take a homeless dude to lunch, maybe you help an old Asian lady change her flat tire, whatever. If you act like a good person long enough, you will become a good person. 

It's like my old mentor Paarthurnax always used to say "" which is better? To be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort"" 

That being said, the fact that you contain enough empathy to worry that you might be an asshole is probably indicative of the fact that you're worrying about this more than most people. 

Try to do good more than you do bad, and realize that no one is really keeping track.

To be fair, I wasn't always super happy. I was in a shit relationship with an asshole who could find ways to be a miserable jackass on a beach in Maui. He wasted his life on being a manchild, and then acted surprised when he gained weight, lost his stamina, didn't want to leave the house, and was miserable all the time, then blamed it on me, on his employers, on not having a better job handed to him, etc., and refused to seek help, saying it was my fault, and if everyone just gave him more stuff, and left him alone, he'd be happy. 

Eventually he cheated on me and walked out, and I was fucked up. Lost my job in the same week, and found out the creepy slut he'd been banging gave me an STD, and was on antibiotics for a month. Needless to say I was pretty low, and felt pretty worthless. I mean, how bad do you have to be for a 30-something unemployed manchild to walk out on you?!

Within a few months, I felt like I was given a second life. I could suddenly do all the stuff I loved without him making fun of me. I could eat the food I liked without him complaining, and I didn't have this constant, oppressive, negative weight coming down on everything I did. To say it was liberating is the understatement of the year. 

It's been 4 years, and I love everything now. I can travel and see great places, and it's made so much better by being able to enjoy a culture, and not listen to bitching about people not speaking English, or having to eat at McDonald's in Rome, or Vienna, or Edinburgh (yes, this actually happened). I can listen to the music I love, and share it with people I love. I can develop myself and improve, have a nice home that I can keep clean, and every day he's not around I'm grateful for everything I have, and so happy to not be a punching bag (literal and metaphorical) for someone else's shit. 

Yeah, I have bad days, and not everything is always great, but I wasted 10 years carrying around someone else's self-loathing, depression, and blame, and I'm never going to spend another day that way. And it feels fucking awesome!","1443657634"

If you have paid ridiculous amounts of money to buy your own spectrum at auction, however, the limits are much higher, because they leave the interference management to you.

Your wireless router breaks the 2400-2499 MHz range up into 11 channels, each 9MHz apart . A cell phone company might buy spectrum in the 700-730 MHz range and with more expensive &amp; sensitive equipment break this up into 10 channels, each 3 MHz apart.

These people are not toys of our government.  They are human beings that deserve honesty and justice.  LET THEM SORT THIS OUT.  Now were in more danger than I can recall in my 32 yr lifetime.  This is a global issue.  And yes I am implying that O and HC are basically lying to the world and they commit fraud and murder.

Investigte your candidate guys.  Most all of them, in court.  They deserve careful inspection by the people.  Like a reality show.  Constant observation and investigation.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;When I say ""infrastructure"", I'm including electric, water, and sewer systems; roads, busses, trains, airports, and other transportation; telecom/cable/internet; and regulatory apparatus like, for example, the FDA. Of these, maybe transportation has convex costs in population...

Aside from maybe the FDA I think all the other instances of infrastructure are going to increase with density.  Building anything that would require taking infrastructure offline will probably incur higher congestion costs.  Building higher, which a denser area would necessitate, costs more per area than something on the ground.  A runway needs to occupy a minimum amount of area.  Land costs more in denser areas so property aquistion would also costs more.  (Tokyo thought it would be cheaper just to build an artificial island as an airport than try to obtain the land).  

&gt;...benefits

So just so we're on the same page you're claiming that there are increasing marginal benefits to infrastructure with increasing density?  I'm going to have to think on that.  I will say that overcapacity is an issue.  So while a higher density may cause a particular piece of infrastructure to be used its optimal capacity it may also  cause it to operate at overcapacity.  Like grid locked roads or subway trains that are so packed the doors have trouble closing. 

&gt;He's complaining about the effects of mass immigration, which
1. the US saw on a much larger scale than he's fretting about from ~140 years ago to ~80 years ago, and 
2. made the US unambiguously better off. 

I'd argue that our country has changed quite a bit since the era of mass migration.  We aren't a small agrarian country with a population of &lt;5M desperately needing bodies to occupy the western territories before the European powers grabbed it.  I don't think the ""kick open the floodgates"" approach to immigration is going to work this time around.  Where's the demand for low-skilled labor like there was during mid-1800's to early-1900's?  Where's the Frontier?  I think we should look to other OECD countries for guidance.  Is Canada letting in millions of immigrants a year regardless of their economic situation?  Is Norway?  I mean why can't we be strategic about who we let in so we can get the most bang for our buck?

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I should also add separately my advice on trading with Talon against mages.

I notice that a lot of Talons retreat the second they take some un-anticipated damage. In actuality, against mages your best bet is to retaliate immediately. It is not like fighting an Irelia or a Jax where they have sustained damage. 

All mages suffer from pretty lengthy cool downs and their AA's usually barely tickle (aside from some passive infused ones like Lux or Ziggs).

And like I said above, if they are stupid enough to either 1) miss you with their CC's skill, or 2) use it to CS - IMMEDIATELY punish them for it.

Disclaimer - playing talon aggressively requires good warding and mini-map awareness.

Talon can be played more passively until 6 to go for the ult kill - but I find I can usually get a kill pre-6 and basically shut down midlane from there.","1443657636"

One of those principles -- a fundamentally important one -- is that the final arbiter of what to believe in should always be real-world evidence, and that relying on anything else is a no-no.

"DarkNetMarkets","t5_2yt0h","&gt;""I was prompted to do this as a few of my normal legal packages had tears, or had been opened and resealed."" 

Well ok that seems fair enough. I'm not entirely sure of the relevance to the coke orders since they're on drop addresses with presumably fake names (otherwise OP is a real bonafide dipshit) but I guess some paranoia and questioing is to be expected when you're ordering over 10 grands worth of cocaine at a time.

&gt;It is entirely reasonable that a postman would recognize a darknet-looking package and try to see what's in it. 

And by the very next line I'm lost again. This theory only makes any form of sense if a DNM package and a legit package aren't immediately seperable, which you seem to think they are immediately seperable. So what else is meant to be going on in this scenario? Is this one postie indiscriminately stealing from every package that comes his way? Is there more than 1 postie involved? Are they opening packages for phone chargers and shit people bought on ebay? How are they getting away with this with no one reporting anything? OP said he has many drop addresses all over QLD, so how the fuck is he getting the same postie nicking his shit? Are the cops the ones tampering with his legit packages? How many parties are involved here? If it's getting nicked at the sorting warehouse for a region or even at the post office itself then how the fuck is anyone there able to pick through the packages? They would be handling 10X the mail the local postman does. QLD isn't Vatican City, it's a huge state and millions of people live there.

&gt;This has happened before. Is it really that unbelievable?

I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just so stupidly unlikely that it goes waaaayyyyy past it ever being plausible, like being bitten by a shark whilst being struck by lightning. 1 big order being pinched by a postie that knows what they're looking for? Maybe thats possible. 3 times, going to 2 different addresses and once being packaged and mailed by OP himself instead of the coke vendor? lolololol.

"1200isplenty","t5_2xk5e","I scroll through Reddit's healthy eating subs: 1200isplenty, loseit, eatcheapandhealthy, vegmeals, etc. From there, it's just following the links and seeing if I like the rest of the bloggers' recipes.

A pet peeve, though: I find that many Healthy Recipe Blogs that post their nutritional content are... false. I'm not sure what brands they're using in their cooking, but whenever I input their recipe into MFP, it's usually more calories than they write. Not by much, but still, when you're eating 1200 a day, it makes you think twice. 77 cal muffin? More like 100+. A slice of quiche that's 100 cal? Nope, definitely more than that.  

If they're going to post nutritional content, then they should also write in specifically what brands they're using... because I have a hard time replicating their calories. Unless they're counting the spray for the pan as 0, or Splenda as 0, or something. But in that sense, I find commenters to be more honest.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","This is the most reasonable and well-explained comment I've seen going against Tyler. Usually people just say ""His albums are bad because he is bad."" Thanks for explaining your opinion.

Tyler is one of my favorites and one of the rappers I have listened to the most. With that said, I only listen to Bastard and Goblin for certain tracks. I will sometimes listen to some tracks off of Bastard and Goblin that I usually don't listen to when they come on during shuffle, but most of the time I skip Goblin and Bastard tracks. But then there is Wolf and Cherry Bomb.

Wolf is one of my favorite hip hop albums right now and maybe one of my all time favorites. I really like all the songs on the album and never skip them (except sometimes Domo23 because I used to play that track all the time). Awkward and Answer never get old for me. I love the production and aesthetic of this album. It is completely different from Goblin but damn does Tyler nail this new style. 

And then Cherry Bomb is taking this new style and twisting it into a new direction, into a more soul, funk, and R&amp;B inspired sound while also giving us a spin on his early Bastard/Goblin sound. Personally, I really enjoyed Cherry Bomb. The only song I skip is the title track, I will sometimes listen to it but I have to be in the right mood. I really like this new sound Tyler gave us in Cherry Bomb and hope his next album is more of this R&amp;B sound while also giving us some good hype tracks. And anything like Smuckers is good by me. I need some features from other people as big as Kanye and Wayne. I think that a Tyler and Kendrick track would be really interesting. Not sure if it would work but Kendrick seems to adapt his style on his features and I haven't heard any bad Kendrick features (inb4 I am linked to bad Kendrick features).

While I disagree, I completely respect your opinion and thanks for giving such a good explanation. ","1443657642"

"Seahawks","t5_2ryle","I'm really not sure what you think happened here, but you are all over this thread insisting that Wilson messed up the throw and jumping on anyone who says anything contrary.  The fact is that if Lockett hadn't led to the left so much after the stutter, he would have had the turn and carry.  And that adjustment after the stutter happened after Russell released the ball.  

You can blame Wilson all you like, but that was on both of them.  They still need to learn each other a bit more, find the targets and routes that work for both of them, and all this will clean up.  That ball in this play was a strong pass to the backfield and pointed where Lockett could play it; it was an accurate drop, it wasn't misplaced due to an early release or any of the typical QB errors, and it had great timing.  If Lockett had kept right longer after the stutter, there wouldn't be any discussion on the play because we'd all think it was perfect.

This all has to do with the chemistry that will come over the season.  Blame, and jumping on people, is just childish.","1443657643"

Thanks for the reply, and for clarifying my confusion.

My example as of late has been with my cell phone carrier's 'tier 1' agents. For whatever reason, they are always without correct information (matters I find out about subsequently), have poor grammar, and even after we seemingly get nowhere, are still inclined to help when it's clear the problem is above their skill-set (as you mentioned in your penultimate paragraph). So when I call back the 4th-5th time and get these 'tier 1' level agents, it's hard to remain patient when you know from prior experiences that you're going to have 10 minutes of your time wasted while we do this phone call dance that will inevitably get nowhere. 

And that's the tricky part. Every agent is new to my case, yet I know they won't be able to help, and trying to be diplomatic about requesting senior (higher tier level) support, almost always results in the agent continuing to try to no avail. Then they seem slighted when I get a little more firm about requesting a senior level specialist.

Just my experiences....maybe I need a new carrier! LOL","1443657644"

&gt; Ryan Friedrich, better known by his moniker Xanopticon, is an electronic musician. One of breakcore's most prominent producers, he has toured internationally and released music with several electronic labels including Hymen Records, Mirex, Cock Rock Disco, Entity and Tigerbeat6. 

&gt; His live shows are often noted for their intensity and his sound for its attention to detail, having been described by one journalist as ""waves of breaks"". 

&gt; Xanopticon's output features dramatic dynamics that alternate between frantic breakcore and more subtle, melodic ambient music, and his sonic heaviness has been compared to labelmates Venetian Snares and Fanny, as well as Belgian flashcore artist Atomhead. Read more on Last.fm.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","&gt; None of the Saints have done it.  They've trusted in God's providence

Exactly imitating the saints in action is not what sanctifies, rather it is imitating their lives in faith and virtue by which Christ Sanctifies us.  Using your logic here, we could say no Catholic should have medical insurance until a certain era, so a good Catholic ought not to be insured because no Saint had done it and it opposes God's Providence.  Now, this is plainly absurd.  We could extend this to not driving cars, not traveling to the Americas, and even not getting martyred by simply shifting the era we view this from.

Next, you're view of relying on God's providence is overly simplistic or possibly fundamentalist in that it ignores our intellect, common sense, and need for prudence.  Keep especially in mind that prudence is a guiding virtue.  Without prudence, mercy becomes weakness, bravery becomes recklessness, and temperance becomes fanaticism.  Look to what the word providence means and you will see it means that God ""Looks ahead"" for us.  In his providence, He blesses us with work and income, with which we need to moderate ourselves so that we can meet our needs.  In this same way, saving for retirement is realizing where we are headed generally and relying on the providence given us.

Now, to respond to another point you made

&gt; Jesus told a parable about not storing up treasures for yourself on earth

Look to the context rather than the single verse.  **You must always look at Biblical passages in their context.  Looking at a single verse is possibly the worst method of literary analysis one could in general take, but especially for the Bible this hold.  A Biblical text without a context is a pretext for ruinous interpretation.**  Look at the snake handler groups as a prime example.

The general context:

“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and decay destroy, and thieves break in and steal. But store up treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor decay destroys, nor thieves break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.

Matthew 6, in general orients the Christian toward humility in prayer and service, intimacy with God, and allowing God to increase in one's heart.  In this particular context, Jesus is not saying, ""don't save anything on earth"".  Rather, this passage encourages us to not be attached to earthly things instead clinging to God.  This does not disallow us from using earthly things or owning earthly things.  It tells us not to make such things the reason for our living.  In this same way, it is expected you would keep food for yourself so that you may not starve.  Common sense is a rather integral part of the daily life of a Catholic.","1443657648"

You don't need to pretend like you have it together if you don't, but you need to work on getting there.  If you are struggling then hiding that fact will only hurt you, it's ok to ask for help.  You are in school. You are there to learn. You don't have to have all the answers.  Take advantage of being a student by getting help from your peers and teachers.  Find out if a tutor is available and go to them.  Go to your teacher's office hours and talk to them about what you aren't getting and what you need to do to improve.  I also think you need to work on being more independent during clinicals.  It is ok if you don't know the answer to a patient's question, you are a student and you are there to work on your skills.  Part of that means gaining the confidence to do it on your own.  It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of anxiety and might benefit from talking to a consoler as well.  Maybe take a look at what changes need to be made in your life or your study habits.  It's not too late for you to turn this around but you have to take advantage of the resources you have in school while you are still there. 

 It sounds like a lot of people go through this.  You can push through and be a great nurse if you work on it!","1443657648"

In terms of the XC90:

* It's an ICE vehicle.  I would prefer not to have another ICE vehicle.
* It has an engine instead of a front trunk.
* I thought earlier models of the XC90 looked better...this one is pretty ugly to me.
* It can support a roof rack, but personally I don't have any use for a rack beyond the one they showed for the back of the Model X.
* Performance is dismal compared to the X, and the mileage is not great either
* Volvo has a great rep in terms of safety, but it's not clear whether the active safety features are on par with Tesla, plus Volvo doesn't update theirs on an ongoing basis the way that Tesla does.
* You mention not liking the rear seats in the Tesla, but the ones in the XC90 appear even less roomy, and less flexible.

I would just be as insistent as possible that you were legitimately occupied with an emergency, but you prefer not to reveal the nature of your emergency if possible. You'll have to play it by ear. I would err toward NOT telling your professor you got a DUI. He'll probably say ""That's not my problem, I didn't tell you to drink and drive"".

I agree it's a little hypocritical because she's had so many plastic surgeries, but her message is that you can still be attractive if you're a little heavier. 

I think Nicki Minaj has played a bigger role in general feminism and gender equality though. If you look at hip hop music before her, there was never a female rapper that had this much success. Sure, there were women who would record vocals for top artists, but there were no dominant female rappers like Nicki. In the past few years, which I would call Nicki Minaj's prime, she signed with YMCMB, the biggest rap group at the time with stars like Lil Wayne and Drake, and then since recorded her last album under her own label. She has had numerous top selling albums, and is still a huge presence in hip hop. It's easy to look at her smaller details and say she isn't a good feminist icon, but, if you look at the big picture, she broke down doors and went into uncharted territory for a women in a previously all male industry.

Bungle: Yes, and we can play with our twangers as well.

Roger: Yes, but it broke my plucking instrument

Geoffrey: Oh nevermind Roger. We’re all going to sing the plucking song. Come on everybody, get your instruments out.

Rod: You want to blow my pipe while I’m twanging away?

Jane: Oh no Rod, I was blowing a lot with Roger last night. But would you like to play with my maracas?

Zippy: Now now, let’s just pluck away with our twangers.

Bungle: It doesn’t matter what size your twanger is.

Zippy: I’ve got a big red one!

George: I’ve only got a tiny twanger but it works well. I like to play with it.

Geoffrey: Well, have you got your twangers out? Now remember, you can bounce your balls at the same time if you like. Or if you haven’t got any balls, you can ask a friend if you can play with his. All right, come on let’s all sing the plucking song.

"fatlogic","t5_2wyxm","Cabbage provides so much better crunch, though.  I do use some iceberg, though, in combination with other greens, mostly just as a filler because it's cheap.  Somehow I managed to get my boyfriend to like salad (it took years!) so between us, we go through a lot of salad greens.  Lettuce, fresh spinach, cabbage, kale.  I bake a bunch of kale into bread, too.  And some spinach, but he has a thing against any spinach that isn't functioning as lettuce, so I'm careful to make sure to disguise cooked spinach until after he's already enjoyed it.  *Then* I tell him that there was spinach in that bread.

"tifu","t5_2to41","To be quite honest, when my ex-wife miscarried, tons of people showed support for us. Even the Chaplain and Unit Commander showed up to my apartment and came to offer their support. After I explained to the Chaplain that I'm Atheist, he still consoled me periodically long after it happened. Maintained a professional friendship with that guy. Really good dude. They gave me about about 3 weeks paid leave to get myself together. Aside from that there wasn't much else they could do to support us. I think most of my problems come from beating myself up over that miscarriage. I think about it every single day even 8 years later.

As for my family, my parents would completely support me even if I went on a drunken rampage and was convicted of multiple counts of manslaughter. So yes. I often refuse help or disclosing any of my issues to people because of pride. They think of me as the most successful member of the extended family. I feel like taking their help would label me as a giant failure to the entire family. So, at this moment, only my father knows about all this and I don't often keep in touch with him. ","1443657661"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I somewhat disagree. You can have competitive drive and desire to win AND confidence without thinking you're the best. I'm very competitive in what I focus on, and while I've won minor local tournaments for SSBM and SSBB and when me and my buddies go on KoF marathons we go full tryhard and I almost always come out on top, but I'm also a realist; there are many, many people out there that are better than me at everything I'm good at. It doesn't mean I never compete in anything and I put every fibre of my being into it when I do (even when I play dreaded ""outdoor"" sports). You don't have to be ignorant to your own level to give it your all.

That being said, this is THE premiere tournament which is supposed to determine who is the universal best team in LoL, so your point does stand in that regard. Unfortunately, CLG has a history of saying this kind of shit then nosediving into failure, and I'm positive that while they SAY they believe they're the best, I don't think they honestly do. There's no way it doesn't sit in the back of their minds that they're going to get obliterated.","1443657661"

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","On the great intelligence, I was thinking...so in the web of fear the intelligence manifests itself, in part, as a growing amount of foam, which absorbs and either kills or possesses people. The very next story has a creature made out of seaweed and foam stating it wants to absorb and possess the earth, with no detail given on how it got here, whether it is alien, etc. When listening to the two stories back to back, I started to wonder if these two stories are connected.

Of course, the problem is that while the web of fear the great intelligence required a massive plan by the doctor to temporarily defeat him, taking the person it was currently presenting with it, the seaweed monsters was entirely destroyed, and lost all of its possessed people, by loud noises. 

So, it can't be the exact same thing. So how about this...the great intelligence is defeated in the web of fear and most, but not all of it, is flung outside space and time again. But it was large as it manifested on earth, and it's mind is larger still, able to sub dividing. Therefore, some of the foam remains alive, though weaker and much smaller. It escapes into the ocean where it begins to possess seaweed (as much as a plant can be possessed) and slowly growing to build its way into the pipes where it can infect people. It is much weaker than in the web of fear, and not as intelligent,mbut the core message of kill-absorb-possess-grow continues. ","1443657661"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; I think the inference of the study is that by overselecting men for board positions it's creating a non-optimal skillset for the board as a whole which could be addressed by either selecting some women or just not being biased towards men at the start.

It could only be addressed by selecting some women if women bring a particular gender-based skillset.  But we have already said that not all women have (what you call) female skills, and that some men have female skills but lack male skills.  So if someone's take away message from the study is that if a board is male-only, then they need to employ some women to add some female skills, then this seems to be a recipe for disappointment (not to mention discrimination against male candidates who may actually have the female skills required).

The cause of the gender divide isn't a topic of the paper, but some cases, it may well be caused by prejudice based on the idea that women lack the necessary skills to be effective board members (just as some people think that women lack the necessary skills to be engineers).  If we are hoping to challenge this prejudice, I don't think that a good starting point is to agree with the sexists that different genders have different skillsets.  That just looks like a huge step backwards, not least because it seems to endorse the kind of lazy gender essentialism that underlies a lot of discrimination and harmful attitudes.","1443657663"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","1.) Rangers are a good archery class, with the fighting style, Hunter's Mark, and some specialized ranged weapon spells, but there are plenty of good ranged classes.

 * Fighters can take the Ranged fighting style and have those lovely attacks per round, and most of the battle maneuvers work with a ranged weapon. A Ranged EK can be just as tanky as a melee EK, and if they aren't trying to tank, they can be very hard to kill indeed.

 * Bards can use a Magical Secrets spell pick at level 10 to pick up Swift Quiver before the Ranger does, giving them up to four attacks per round.

 * Rogues can Sneak Attack with a Ranged Weapon, giving them a solid damage progression. Crossbow Expert is a great way to pick up a reliable Bonus Action attack in case their first attack misses. Ranged weapons can't make OAs, so your Reaction is free to Uncanny Dodge. This makes them surprisingly tanky.

 * War Cleric and Sharpshooter get along famously, especially if taken at level 1 with Variant Human. With Bless to add 1d4 to the attack roll, their +10 to hit Divine Inspiration feature (1/short rest until higher level), and their Bonus Action attack (Wis modifier per Long Rest) allow them to pop off accurate +10 damage shots at low level to great effect. At higher level, the crossbow remains relevant with their extra damage feature, hitting harder than Sacred Flame, but they'll probably use your Bonus Action for something else like Spiritual Weapon. Fun concept - animate a bunch of skeletons, use Crusader's Mantle (1d4 radiant damage to weapon attacks in 30' radius) and be the party's whole back line!

 * I feel like i'm forgetting one. Hmm...

2.) No, you can multiclass as much as you want, and the prereqs for Bard and Warlock are the same. Those few Warlocks give the Bard an excellent main attack, which leads to...

3.) Yes, EB/AB is really quite good. 1d10 damage is the same as a Halberd. The number of attacks scales up to 4 faster than the Fighter's attacks do. If you take some Sorcerer levels for Quicken Spell, you can pump out a lot of hits at a reasonable level, up to 8 by level 17. Most people couple it with Hex for 1d6 extra damage per attack. It isn't the highest damage out there, or even the highest ranged damage, but it's pretty damn close, and again it is very little hassle, just two Warlock levels. Those Warlock levels come with a bunch of extra goodies too. Short rest spell slots are particularly nice for a long rest caster, and there are some fantastic Invocations you can pick up (namely Devil's Sight, but also some others.)

 * Fun concept - Warlock 2, Fighter 2, Sorcerer X - Once per Short Rest, you could Action Surge and Quicken to cast Eldritch Blast 3 times once per short rest. By level 12 when you hit 20 Cha, that's 9 attacks for 9d10+9d6+45 damage, average 126 if everything hits. If the Sorcerer is Favored Soul (Life Domain), then you can have Bless up to make these attacks more accurate.","1443657666"

"wheeloftimerp","t5_38u4l","Name: [Corhyn Jagsad](http://imgur.com/tPWy5ZS)

Age: 36

Born: 920 NE

Gender: Male

Eye Color: Blue/green

Hair Color: Dark brown

Nation: Shienar

Gift: Agility

Skills: Swords, Hunting, Dancing

Corhyn was, as all Shienarans are, raised to fight the Shadow. His mother perished during his birth and his father fell defending Tarwin's Gap not long after. Corhyn was raised by his brothers as a result. They taught him the blade as he soon as he could hold a blade and Corhyn's childhood was spent fighting against the unending Blight. He was not as strong as the other children, but what Corhyn lacked in strength he made up for with his almost-superhuman reflexes and speed. As a child he was able to strike six times without being touched.  

The Shadow took his eldest brother before he turned twelve and he lost two more brothers within the year. At the age of 15 Corhyn lost his last surviving family member to a trolloc raid and while there were requests for Corhyn to be adopted, he rejected. Corhyn remained with those who would train him until the day he turned 16. With only his sword and a few meager coins, Corhyn left Shienar and journeyed along the Blight. He fought where he wished and lived as he could. His life alone lasted for eighteen years until one day Corhyn was found near death surrounded by ranks of trollocs. 

Courting death was a trait that had been attributed to Corhyn since the day he left Shienar, but he had never been foolish. The wounds he'd sustained compared to the number of dead trollocs earned him the name 'the Wolf of Shienar', though Corhyn always insisted he disliked the name. It took many months for Corhyn to heal, but once he was able to walk again he surprised all by not returning to the Blight. Instead, he looked to the South and left for the White Tower.","1443657666"

* DANCE PARTY! - Not so far.

* A metric tonne of hype - Yes? No? I don't actually know how much hype this game got, really.

* Misleading demo - I'm not familiar with Until Dawn's demo, so I couldn't say. It probably is a bit, though, considering the entire first half of the game is pretty deliberately misleading.

* Unfeasibly large apartments - Not apartments, but the lodge is certainly large. But then, the family is apparently rich, so... Hard to say if we can check this one off.

* Pointless flashback - Not that I can recall.

* Awkward sex - Nope.

* Slap fight. - Not that I can recall.

* White knighting - I'm not sure what counts as ""white knighting"" exactly, but Chris for Ash probably counts. Maybe with Mike and Jess or Matt and Emily, too, depending on player's choices.

* Ancient conspiracy - Not really. I wouldn't call the curse of the wendigo a conspiracy.

* QTE's - Free space. Yep.

* ""But the police don't work that way!"" - Maybe with the situation in the radio tower? Probably not, though.

* Creepy headshots - Probably, though more deliberately than in David Cage games.

* Scene stolen from a movie - Pretty much the point of the game.

* Creepy shower scene - Bath scene. Creepy, but because there's a psycho stalking her, not because the scene feels creepy in itself.

* Lying to the player - Maybe? Pretty much everything with Josh is meant to deliberately mislead the player. Not sure if you'd count that as ""lying.""

* Noble homeless people - The fire man? Would he count?

* Daddy issues - Not that I can recall. Dead sister issues certainly.

* Strong, powerful woman saved by a man - I think Mike (and maybe Matt?) is the only playable character depicted as strong and powerful.

* Asshole army guys - Not army, but maybe the police from the radio tower could be considered a jerk? Arguably?

* Mystical forces from nowhere - I think the wendigo curse counts.

* Your choice didn't matter - I'm sure there are lots of choices in this game that don't matter, but a lot of them definitely do. Much more than in David Cage's games (although choices did matter a fair amount in Heavy Rain).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","In short, it's a lot cheaper for a company to put in an ""expensive"" processor and sell it for lots than to put in a decent processor and a decent graphics card. Look at, for example, the cost of a midend card like the 970 or the 960. Alone they dwarf the price of most processors outside of i7 territories, and that's without the price of an included processor.

Furthermore, the average person knows nothing about GPUs, ""PC gamers"" included. They look at the processor and think more processor = more good, and buy it. Or hell, look at how they buy GPUs. They sell 4GB and 8GB models of mid-low end gpus like the 950s and 960s, even though any game capable of drawing that amount would be so cripplingly demanding, it would make the gpu melt. Again, they do this because people think more vram = more performance, so they are willing to spend more for a shitty card.","1443657667"

Most top tier schools are very hard to get into and there are only a few in any given city. I would hate for you to decide your school of choice is X, apply to X, finally get in, spend a year finishing pre reqs, while spending top dollar, and then not get into X, which is a very real possibility.  (In my current DPT class, only 2 students went to the University for undergrad and we have a larger than typical class size, I'd guess that average is only 1 student/year).

I would however, research what schools you want and find out what they require. Some require certain courses (typically A &amp; P) to be upper division, but most don't. If the schools you are interested don't want the upper division course work, then definitely take them at a community college; Grad school is freaking expensive, you don't want any debt from pre reqs as well. 

In short, try and complete your pre reqs as cheaply as possible while still keeping all options open (well, options that you care about).

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","The purpose of nameless shmucks in a film series like Star Wars is to give the viewer a sense of wonder and therefore make the world seem to have more depth.

This is because of the fact that in the real world- whose population a film will never really be able to match- you see so many people through the course of a day that you *don't* know all of their stories, so in your head, you theorize and make up stories for them. Mulling these things over is part of what helps humans form their sense of compassion.

This works even better for a universe containing numberless, interconnected, populated planets, making the background characters incredibly unique, which gives them lots of material for the viewer to extrapolate from, to think and use their imagination on. The fact that there are *many* of these interesting background characters, too many to think about in one sitting, makes the premise of this large universe believable and gives the viewer a sense of awe.

By ""explaining"" these extras instead of writing their own, EU authors are taking that phenomenon away.","1443657669"

My cousin had been in her class 6 years prior, and had caused all sorts of trouble. I was a very quiet, shy student who never made a peep in class, but this teacher seriously despised me as soon as she knew I was related to my cousin. She would find reasons to blame me for things that happened in class and call me out. For instance, a bunch of us were standing around in the classroom before class began, and someone knocked the coffee maker off a shelf. It was a total accident and I saw who did it, but the teacher immediately singled me out, bitched me out as if I did it on purpose, and told me I needed to buy her a new one. I didn't tell on the other person because I'm not a snitch, so I took the blame and got her a new coffee maker. But seriously there is no way she could have seen who did it, and I was not even standing close enough to have been a suspect. The only way I knew how to get back at her was to ace the shit out of her class (high school geometry), which I did. And then my younger sister had her class a couple of years later, and tormented the crap out of her because she had undiagnosed ADHD and pretty much tormented the crap out of everyone.

I cannot find the exact number of tokens anywhere online, so it's hard to speculate on the number of tokens Honda will have remaining after carrying out these important changes. However, it can't be many more tokens. 

While Honda can make a huge leap forward, this is make or break for them. McLaren will not tolerate another year and if they can't fix this, they might not get another chance. Next year, ICE components such as upper and lower crankcase, valve drive, ancillaries drive, camshaft profile and cam covers get locked for development.

Nexus 5x 32GB: $630 *

As with my N5 purchase, estimated shipping time has helped me select which colour I want. Ice Blue looks pretty cool but only black is showing 2-3 weeks (rest are 3-4 weeks).

Also I think the soft touch coatings will be similar as with the Nexus 5, since I read LG used ""similar materials"" for the casing.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","You are missing the entire point that I was making. I'm not misinformed. I hear what the stated goals of feminism are but much of what I see in the mainstream contradicts those goals and come across as pedantic such as the ""manspreading"" issue. I am logical enough to see this as a fringe and farcical issue that most feminists wouldn't waste their time on, but many people (men) probably couldn't see that. You should give me some fucking credit for actually discussing this stuff and participating in this sub.

The majority of men ARE misinformed. They aren't going to go out of their way to correct their ignorance because they don't even know they have it. It is feminists responsibility imo to make sure that their message gets out there in the purest form possible.   The first thing most of them hear are the vocal minority voices. You have a responsibility as a feminist to police the messages of feminism or else it will be corruptible. If you let those people speak for you in the name of feminism, they will cause harm, which is the entire point of this thread.

Your ""questions"" don't make any sense in the context of what I am saying. It doesn't matter who the ""leaders"" of the movement are if their voices are drowned out by extremists and morons.

"rokugan","t5_2sjr8","My Campaign started off Pre-Scorpion Clan Coup and had the players involved in that. After saving the young Emperor (or avenging his Father), the party generally became part of the Loyalist faction.

But my big Point of Departure for the series was kind of two fold.

1. Doji Satsume survived the Coup and essentially took over the Empire as ""acting Regent."" And

2. The Emperor did *not* become the host of Fu Leng.

The led to a great series of struggles as the Emperor was young, hot headed, and rather progressive (he spent a lot of time with Phoenix tutors in the arts and Kakita Toshimoko as sword master). As the various PCs (we had a cast of like ten to twenty PCs rotated out) also influenced them, a lot of them were also fairly... liberal. So my Emperor became more of a Meji / Peter the Great who sought to modernize the Empire and regain Imperial control over the warring Clans.

Satsume was a hardliner who wanted power and the Old Ways (he was also being secretly controlled by Ambition, when Kachiko secretly slipped it to him).

It ended with a MASSIVE civil war, culminating in the Unicorn attacking the Empire under a Moto warlord, the Kitsu summoning a dead Emperor form heaven to ""replace the foolish boy Emperor and Power Mad Shogun"" and ended up getting the Iron Chrsysanthum (sp), the Emperor and his Loyal forces AND a massive Invasion of Shadowlands led by a corrupt Yogo Junzo / Kuni Yori (who tainted and twisted Kisada).

There were spirits (including past dead PCs from a Multi-generational Legacy game), Shadowlands, PCs who were retired to become Generals/Faction Leaders, Every Clan fighting, 3 Emperors (if you include Daigotsu), and a wily Monk running around trying to protect the eggs of the Elemental Dragons (who would hatch only if the Elemental Dragons died).

It got silly at times, it had total power creep (half the party was on first name basis with the Emperor on at least one character), but the story was OURS.","1443657672"

This week I baked a light sourdough rye bread. I slightly modified a Tartine no.3 recipe and used the Tartine method to make/bake the bread. Here are the weights:

200g Bread Flour

350g AP Flour

200g Light whole-wheat 

100g Whole-grain wheat 

150g Dark Rye 

70g Wheat Germ 

850g Water

150g Leaven

25g Sea Salt

Bake in a dutch oven with lid on at 500 for 20 minutes, take the lid off and turn down to 450, finish the loaves ~25 more minutes. Really excellent flavour on these. Dinner tonight will be sandwiches made with this bread.

If we're reducing range then infinite vertical range makes no sense.  However, we should be reducing it's bullet velocity and increasing spread, not introducing a 'hard' limit for the bullets.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Guy got crushed between a wall and an 18-wheeler.

This was at a UPS hub a number of years ago. Most trailers we used had roll-up doors on the back, so the doors could be opened and closed without having to move the trailer. However, some of the older trailers and rental trailers had the more conventional double door on the back. This meant the doors had to be opened before the truck was backed onto a door for loading/unloading.

A truck arrived with these doors, so the driver hopped out and opened the back doors before he backed the trailer to the door, as would be expected. Unfortunately, the hub this trailer came from failed to put a load retainer (like a net that keeps the packages from shifting) in the trailer. So, as the driver was backing the trailer to the door, he hit a small bump and a package fell out of the back of the trailer.

One of the unloaders noticed this and waved for the driver to stop backing up. He hopped down from the door, grabbed the package, and tossed it into the building. However, he had issues getting himself back up into the building, so he was essentially trapped between the trailer and the building.

The driver assumed the unloader had made it back in the building, so he started backing up again. Imagine a scene like the one where Luke Skywalker &amp; Co. are trapped in the garbage compactor on the Death Star. The guy panics and tries to scramble into the building, but ends up getting the lower half of his body crushed between the trailer and the wall.

He survived the initial trauma, but as is frequently the case with crush injuries the act of freeing him from the trailer was going to kill him almost instantly. They shut the hub down, called his family in to say their goodbyes, and then pulled the truck away.

And that, children, is why you never exit the building through a loading dock door. Also, pro tip, if you lay on the ground you should be thin enough for the bumper of the trailer to go right over you, thus saving you from being crushed.","1443657677"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","On NPR the other day there was a professor from Stanford talking about the biggest challenges they face with self-driving cars. 

Every year for the past 10-15 years they've held a self-driving car contest and the first one was a disaster, they all failed. Now they have cars that are very good, but still have some kinks to work out. 

Even though they're able to drive miles at a time by themselves, they still will come upon situations where they don't know what to do and freak out and revert control back to the driver. This wouldn't be an issue, except the person in the drivers seat is almost never ready to take the reins. They're either on their phone or talking or not paying attention to the road enough to react quickly.

So even with self-driving cars the biggest problem is with the drivers.","1443657678"
"exjw","t5_2qp5l","I saw this video years ago when I was an atheist and I still often think about that line ""you have to account for bone cancer in children."" That sort of sentiment is exactly why I feel that any conscious/personal god that might exist (I remain unconvinced) has to either be passive, unable to help people, or, yes, capricious and unpleasant and deliberately doesn't help people.

It's funny because the more I learn about polytheism, the more I agree with Fry that it's a good concept. I really prefer it over monotheism. I consider myself a pantheist/panentheist and animist nowadays because I used to not be able to wrap my head around the ""many gods"" thing at all.

But recently I learned a lot about how polytheism and monotheism are set up, and once you understand the whole ""metadivine realm"" thing, you realize polytheistic gods aren't supposed to be all-powerful perfect all-knowing creator gods like a monotheistic god is. Which is really way more interesting, I think. Not quite as black and white.

**ETA:** Re-reading this I see that it makes me look like I 100% believe in polytheistic gods, but that isn't the case. I don't really believe in anything except what I can see. I'm just saying if I had to choose between monotheism and polytheism, I'd prefer polytheism.","1443657678"

But learning the basics of what one should do to prepare for the future isn't as daunting as it *seems* to be. It just comes down to finding a place or person who can explain it to you in a way you understand, and figuring out how much nuance you need to or want to know.

For instance, I have a Roth IRA, which is mine and not tied to an employer. If I worked and was offered a 401k, it may or may not be worth the hassle to put money in it if I don't anticipate staying there for a long time.

You can very easily fall into the rabbit hole of personal finance.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I see the MCU's Phases being a part of a more overarching ""trilogy"" series as time goes on. Three phases consisting of 4-6 movies that center around a central theme/tone/team of heroes with a bigger threat looming. And the third Phase's final film concludes with the bigger threat showing itself.

And I can honestly live with that happily. The MCU is one of the things I look forward to most every year. Even if the quality of them slips a bit they are still going to be entertaining as Hell. I just hope Marvel learns from their damn mistakes and start making better villains for people to cheer against because of their twisted justifications for their actions.

Personally, my own hope for Phase Four-Six's big threat turns out to be ""Secret Invasion"" with the Skrulls. Its too big and epic of a storyline arc not to try and do in the MCU. And there would be A LOT of movies they could delve back into from Phases One-Six they could have had characters replaced and make you look/watch them a bit differently.","1443657681"

If you do that kind of ranking, the first thing you should ask yourself is, ""is that variable relevant?"" and ""Why do I use that variable"". Lets take an extreme example. I'm gonna rank players by their hair lenght. I will be able to do a ranking and write stuff too but what's the point, what do I try to prove. If you listen to the Thorin/Montecristo ranking, they explained there variable and why they were relevant for them. I could disagree with them but at least there variables are not random, they show someting. In that example, they wanted to pick the top 20 players at world. To do so they picked subjective variable like the impact they had on the game and sometime objectives variable like the gold / damage dealt ratio to back it up.

4. Dumuzid: Sumerian underworld... oh yea :)

I am relegated to sitting there and hoping they make a mistake, because if I try to fight back, I take more damage than I am able to dish out, *no matter what*

"news","t5_2qh3l","I've been to and graduated from the course. It is confirmed they lowered the standards.

For years if you failed a phase more than once for the same reason it was a drop from the course, no questions asked. There were rare exceptions, but we are talking very rare here. I have a half dozen  close friends who know this first hand, saw it happen to dozens of other dudes when I was there.

Now, when these ladies went through, 8 of them failed patrols twice. Every SINGLE one of them got a day one recycle. Only two took it. Of that had happened to a guy 6 months before he would be forced to go back to his unit and not allowed to come back for 6 months.

I've heard through the grapevine from reputable sources some of these ladies were recommended to be dropped but the RTB commander denied it. Hearsay of course but I've heard it from people who were cadre there at the time.

Even without all the other allegations they admitted that the women were pushed through when they should have been dropped according to a long standing course policy that somehow got revoked for females.

My personal opinion is some shady shit went on there for political reasons. Wouldn't be the first time. It's just a damn shame because by all accounts those two ladies are exceptional Soldiers and deserve better than to receive a special treatment, I know they wouldn't have asked for it.","1443657686"

Yah, so look into the child theme. It may have more files than just the 'style.css' and the 'functions.php'. Those are the primary ones you'll be using and modifying until you get deeper into everything.

When you look at them, yo9u should see essentially the code that I posted above. Those are what link the child theme to the parent theme. In functions.php you 'enqueue' the .css file(s). In style.css you name the template and that links/imports the functionality.


So, as long as you see the above, you'll be fine.

I'm still somewhat new to all of this, and I know there are other ways to include files from the parent theme (using 'import'), but I dont really know much about them except that they are no longer considered 'best practices.'


Oh, but also, to answer your question: Yes. Upload the child theme and then switch to it. Nothing on your site should change because its pulling from the parent theme. So, if everything looks different, you might need to take a step back and figure it out, but if it came pre-built then it shouldnt be an issue.","1443657689"

Compared to say Rocket League, which I believe was given out on it's actual release date and valued at $20, and the general consensus is people like it. And that $20 is already 40% of what you paid for the whole year, with just 1 game out of numerous you receive for the year.

The desire for the games given is incredibly subjective, which is why I look at it more for the monetary value of what is given relative to what I am spending. Even personally I know I'll never play some of those games, but I know I am getting my moneys worth.

Side note being the $1000+ amount is for the amount given at the time they are put up for free and not their original value, unless they happen to be nice and give games out during their release like Rocket League.","1443657691"

"japan","t5_2qh2u","&gt; People would love to have bigger homes with larger yards.

Nope. *Some* people might want that, but in general it's just not true. There are many non-financial reasons that people do not want this. The main one I hear is maintainence. People think having a big house/yard means more work taking care of it, and they don't want to spent their weekends on such things. I don't share this opinion, but I acknowledge it makes some sense if you're that way inclined, and it certainly derives from traditional Japanese ideas about how to live. Another reason is security/community. People say that if their neighbors' houses are far apart they don't feel as safe/secure, and they don't feel as close to their neighbors. Another reason is sustainability. A growing proportion of the house-building market is actually starting to care about how much resources go into building their house and/or how much resources it will consume once they are living in it. Such concerns inevitably lead to smaller houses.

There are other cultural reasons too (e.g. many people are very scared of *appearing* ostentatious), but the point is that, as other commenters have noted, cost is not necessarily the main reason for small houses in Japan.

&gt; Go out to the countryside. I assure you there are large homes with large yards.

I live in the countryside. I also travel a lot. This is just not true. There are certainly more houses (as opposed to apartments) in inaka, as well as farmland of course, but a farm is not a yard. And the houses are not big at all (at least not by US standards). This is partly for the reasons stated above. It's also because of the pressure to use all available land for farming. Have you been to England? It's basically the same there. Even in farming towns surrounded by acres and acres of land, people usually live in tiny houses. To a North American or Australian sensibility, it is almost incomprehensible, but there are strong historical reasons for it.","1443657694"

it's not rare, you're telling me to use terminology correctly and i am. all hypoglycemia means is ""low blood sugar."" it's the state in which your body is experiencing a low enough blood sugar level to affect you cognitively and physically. if you're getting your information off the wikipedia page, 1. it's wikipedia, 2. their hypoglycemia page is diabetes-centric because hypoglycemia is a large part of having diabetes, and its what most people know its from. which is i assume is what you also know it's from as well.

this situation is like someone calling ""psychosis"" a disorder. no, psychosis is a symptom. it can occur to otherwise healthy people, but usually occurs to people with larger problems. (scizophrenia, bipolar, trauma disorders). but it can also happen to people under a lot of stress, like the losss of a love one or a car crash.

hypoglycemia is a symptom that happens when your blood sugar is being yo-yo'd either because you're diabetic and can't control it, or because you have a fucking eating disorder and are on a fucking pro eating disorder subreddit","1443657696"

"penguins","t5_2r549","Gonch has been playing better. Though he was on the ice for a goal I don't think he could have done anything to prevent. He individually did everything right in that play. 

I actually think Perron is the type of player who could transition to the other side. I think there would be a learning curve, but as a coach and hockey player there are positives and negatives of having a righty play the right side. On balance I think it's really a zero sum game depending on the player once they've transitioned. 

There was just a great article in the players Tribune where James Neal was asked to make the opposite switch by Dan Bylsma and James Neal made a sidenote thanking Dan for being a tremendous teacher and changing the way he played. 

I think Kunitz is the most obvious fit for that grouping right now though. I mean let's face it, even if he's lost half a step and he's not as great a playmaker as two seasons ago, he still has history with Crosby who is a visual player--he reads off guys which means he knows what it's going to look like when Kunitz is making a turnover BEFORE it ever happens. Kunitz is predictable and that makes it much easier for Kessel to adapt to his style and from there you have a good group for solid puck support.

If Perron is going to succeed outside his natural wing, I don't want him thrown in the deep end at the start of the season. Let him get some practices in for a few weeks. Try him again if someone needs a rest or something. Feel it out.","1443657700"

It looks like this version of [Mexico is also on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsUMa3yeYYc)

My guess is you could track down all these songs via youtube. The docs they come from seem to be out there in video format.

However Marths grab range is just better than most tether grab ranges anyway so why does it even matter? All it ends up doing is preventing tether grab characters from shield grabbing whatsoever, with no apparent benefits--i.e. the followups from grab that tether grab characters have is no better than any followups some characters have from normal grabs, in some cases grabs that come out faster, have less endlag, and have better followups.

I don't really see a design rationale for this other than ""flavor"" which IMO is a bad reason to nerf a character.","1443657701"

2. Gameplay type. There are plenty of RPG mechanics for different people who are looking for a different interactive experience. Some RPGs focus on combat, others on narrative, others on worldbuilding etc. From what you already mentioned it seems like a combat-heavy game with minimal role-playing is what you are after. 

So I'd say go for D&amp;D. It's a good introductory game and recent editions have been focusing a lot on ""streamlined combat boardgame without parameters as to what you can try"" so it's the safest bet as far as I know. ","1443657701"

&gt;I reached out to an actual OB-GYN, Dr. Jen Gunter, about the video. After watching it, she told me that it doesn't look like an abortion, but rather a premature delivery. ""The fetus delivers very quickly and without instrumentation,"" she explained. ""This is what we do with a very premature delivery."" 


&gt;Gunter pointed to a few other signs that this is a delivery and not an abortion. ""The cord clamp,"" for one, she explained. ""In an abortion the cord would simply be cut."" She also noted that the lengthy wait for the placenta is typical in a delivery, but ""if this were an abortion the placenta would be removed almost immediately with suction."" 


&gt;While Gunter couldn't rule out abortion completely, noting that that there was a remote possibility that this is ""an atypical technique,"" she emphasized that ""unless they produce the doctor that did it,"" we should be skeptical. Cunningham declines to provide the doctor's identity, claiming ""confidentiality,"" even though a doctor speaking broadly about his work violates no one's confidentiality. Apparently, violating the woman's privacy—which this video does—is no problem at all.

With regards to the club he wasn't found guilty by the court and as I said Terry denies it so I don't think they feel the need to put anymore judgement upon the player as well as pretty much call him a liar. He did get stripped of his England captaincy and dropped though. Despite his shortcomings he took great pride in that role and gave it his all. So losing that must have hurt, he didn't get off completely scott free. Generally you'll find a club sticks with their plays until they leave or are subtly forced out. I don't think United would vocally denounce their player, they'd be fined maybe or quietly shown the door if it was really bad as soon as they found an offer they thought fair. Suarez?

How I learned is:

1. Boil some water, and put a filter in the bottom black filter

2. Pour some hot water in your mug and through your filter to warm everything up

3. Leave the plunger out and put a scoop of coffee (ground medium fine) into the aeropress

4. Pour slightly sub boiling water into the aeropress up to the 1 and give it a stir, and put a timer on for 2 minutes

5. At 1:15 pour water up to 4 and wait for the rest of the time and put the plunger in at an angle and pull up a bit to make a vacuum seal

6. Wait for the rest of the time and press down the plunger and your coffee is done!

(Clean up is just taking off the black filter and pressing the plunger through, give it a bit of a wash and you're done)

tl;dr Aeropresses are awesome.","1443657702"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","How *Serious Sam* has no true bullet sponges. Aside from bosses, Serious Sam has no enemy that can't die in a handful of seconds. This is because of the varied rosters of weapons, they each have its roles. Some are good at dealing with massive amounts of fodder (dangerous fodder) while some, for which ammo is rare usually get used to deal with the more dangerous stuff in seconds. Seems really basic right? Well,  many devs don't know. Shadow Warrior's biggest problem was the amount of non-threatening bullet sponges that took forever to take down no matter what you hit them with.


The amount of race and background variety in *Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup*, how you have to adapt to what the dungeon gives you to make your own build and then how it will test it and try to kill it. Winning with the classic Minotaur Berserker feels good but beating it with a weird combination just to see if you make it work and then manage to do so with the help of some spells or tools you wouldn't have thought of using at first feels incredible. Also, the lack of ""skill trees"", true classes (freeform, like Dark Souls in a way) and of course, Gods.

From *Dark Souls* the way weapons scale differently with stats. I love it. It gives the system a lot of depth and makes more weapons ""good"" that is usual in an Rpg. Weapons don't just scale from worse to better. There are weapons that shine if you have bad stats, because they don't really scale with anything - but they still do good damage regardless (Drake Sword anyone). Then there are weapons that only start showing their true colours only once you have invested enough in their respective stat. The movesets also distinguish them further, a weapon can be great in all the above ways but if it has a shitty moveset you should think twice. Also, how it rewards you for using your eyes.

How *Spelunky* and *Nethack* handle shopkeepers. Some times its just fun to steal something powerful and kill the poor lad with it

Its hard to nail down, but the combination of things that make *TF2* so great. Its not just about specific guns or classes but just how everything comes together for the battlefield to feel like it does. How no class is truly well rounded

How they nailed plasmids, guns, traps and builds in *Bioshock 2*. The game is not perfect but no other game does that stuff. Also the hacking. Its genious. Its so barebones and simple but it's so much better than that in the first game. If you hacked something midfight in Bioshock 1 you got drawn out of it to play pipemania, in Bioshock 2 you have to hack And fight if you choose to do this making it a lot more tense and making the possibility of screwing up both the fighting and the hacking very real","1443657705"

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Thousand Yard Stare. With the right perks, you can get up to 5 shots on Ogres without reloading. The problem with both Spindle and 1k's perks are that they only proc with precision damage - which Oryx's chest does not take. In my personal opinion, it's easy to use up more sniper ammo on Ogres with Spindle because it'll just go straight to your magazine - and therefore you may not have enough for his chest. In my experience, 2/3 shots with 310 1K plus a little primary can solo any Ogre while conserving sniper ammo.

Therefore, in regards to staggering Oryx, having a 4 shot sniper is more beneficial than a 3 shot. Black Spindle DOES have a higher impact yes, but nobody has really crunched the numbers in regard to Oryx's chest damage.

1K provides more overall utility for that fight, especially when both rifles are at 310. And the fact that it's legendary allows you to use Touch of Malice/Red Death/Bad JuJu.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Of course! :) 
Well, a number of things:

1) Lack of physical evidence

2) Christian doctrines and teachings that seemed horrifically unfair

3) Seeing the amount of damage, pain, and hurt that has been caused by Christianity in my own life. (and not only seeing it, but being willing to see it. Being willing to not look passed it any more).

4) Realization that all of the spiritual evidence that I still believed could be explained by chemistry and biology. How could I be sure it was God talking to me in my prayer time when I can use a number of different techniques (utilizing any subject matter) to self induce the same state of mind.

5) Realizing that the non-Christian friends that I'd had for about a year cared more about me and were closer to me than the Christian friends I'd had for over 7 years.

6) Realizing that the non-Christian friends I had were actually far more well adjusted to life and society than me or my Christian friends. 

7) Realizing that sex really isn't that big of a deal at all (when I finally had it). It's actually kind of stupid (its awesome, and important to relationships, of course! But its role is WAAAY overblown in the Christian world.)

8) Realizing that even if this whole thing was real, there is no way that a God would expect any person to accept any ""religion"" that the person couldn't have arrived at without outside influence (I know, that one's a little head-y, and I don't expect you to agree with that. It's something I arrived at near the end of my ""deconversion"")

9) Realizing that much of the universe could be explained using the tools of science and the theories that we've come to as a human race. I didn't need the concept of a God to explain the world around me. The beauty and the elegance of the scientific method, and it's ability to help people change what they believe, in order to fit the evidence that is presented. (I know, at first that seems a little sketchy and closed minded, but think about it, it's almost literally the definition of ""open-minded"")

10) Realizing how closed minded 95% of the people in the church are. 

10a) Corollary to number 10. Realizing exactly how much mind control goes on in any religion. It's so well refined and subversive that I even still occasionally have a hard time picking it out. 

That's all I can think of for now, but there might be more. Any questions or comments?

Part of my deconversion was promising myself that I would still be open to ideas and discussions with Christians (and all other peoples too) and never try to explicitly ""deconvert"" anyone. I love talking about why I don't think there is a God, because I find the subject completely interesting. But I also don't think that unbelief is for everyone. ","1443657708"

Notice the two websites? It's treated as two entities. Those that are in Deloitte Consulting, and the other guys. I have a friend doing Fed consulting in DC who was a marketing major, I also have friends doing advisory, and those doing audit. Shit is not the same and you pretending like you know more than someone who actually is in public accounting? Is hilarious. 

Just admit you actually want the highest starting salary possible and that's your career driver. There's no shame in it. But that's right you did an audit internship probably thinking you could switch over to consulting. Especially S&amp;O. 

http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/careers/articles/join-deloitte-strategy-operations-mba.html

But then again why would a company advocate and demonstrate that they pay for so many MBA's to want your undergraduate accounting major. 

Side note: Deloitte Consulting recruited at my school and hosted case competition which I participated in, considered human capital consulting, and decided that audit would lead to a CPA/a more stable life. ","1443657711"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","5e. I accidentally put all the most obnoxious to DM monsters in one encounter.

* What happens when a creature (giant shadow octopus) grappling a PC is forced to move (thunderwave)?

* What EXACTLY happens when a creature attempts to hide (a shadow)?

* A shadow can hide in dim light. How does that interact with darkvision?

* How do PCs track down invisible creatures? What if the invisible creatures don't touch the ground and use ranged attacks (poltergeist)?

Edit: Thanks for the advice. For reference, how I ran it in game:

* The grapple was broken (which was really good for the PCs, as giant shadow octopuses have 18 strength, proficiency in grappling, and the ability to drain strength every turn).

* I made the shadows invisible when hiding (adv on attacks, attackers have disadv attacking, breaks when it attacks).

* I let them see it. In the future I'd probably say the ability is a merge-into-the-environment thing because 5e darkvision is crazy strong.

* From what I can tell, the only way to run it is to throw the party hints. I kept mentioning specific bookcases rattling, and telling them that they felt a force coming from a specific direction. Looks like that's the only way to do it.","1443657713"

The UN Charter?!

&gt;UN Resolutions that are not binding in any way.

Look, if you don't even understand the difference between the Security Council and the General Assembly, let alone what the UN Charter is, I don't really see how you can pretend to understand the implications of UN Security Council resolutions. Just because a Security Council resolution isn't taken under an article that authorizes military force does not make it ""non-binding"". All pertinent Security Council decisions are binding on member states, and in the case of UNSC 242, the relevant portion was just re-emphasizing and reminding Israel of what the UN Charter requires.

&gt;And the Settlements are expansions to pre-existing jewish settlements that predate any occupation.

Uh what? No. The first settlements weren't set up until a few months after the Six Day War concluded. I don't know where you're getting your history from but it's wrong.

&gt;Can you define what exactly a Hamas member looks like?

You don't have to wipe out all their members to destroy the organization, and it certainly is within their capability to assassinate most of the Hamas leadership basically all at once.

&gt;Why did they roll tanks?

It's irrelevant, the point is they annexed the territory through warfare, which is not legitimate.

&gt;And your forgetting WHY he didn't release them. Because the PA didn't release their prisoners.

Huh? The Palestinians were not under any obligation to release further prisoners. In fact, Netanyahu's stated reason for reneging on releasing the last batch of prisoners was that the Palestinians refused to extend the peace negotiations beyond the year that they'd agreed to in 2013.

The Leaf is in possession of the strongest of the nine Tailed Beasts, and at that time, one of the two beasts not in Akatsuki's possession. As a Jinchuuriki, Naruto is a massive military asset to the Leaf, and losing him would severely cripple them.  

And because Pain was in the Leaf specifically to capture Naruto, Danzo probably figured that he would leave after discovering that Naruto was no longer in the Leaf. It would give the survivors more time to analyze Pain's abilities and to prepare for the counterattack. It was a moment of weighing the losses and predicting the possible outcomes of what would happen if Naruto returned or if he didn't.","1443657718"

I agree.

Iceland allows responsible whaling for practical economic reasons... and because we don't like foreigners telling us what to do. That being said, it's becoming harder and harder to make the economic case as iceland grows as a tourist destination so it probably won't be long until whaling ceases. 

I don't see any problem with it as long as it's as humane as possible and doesn't devastate whale population, Like I said regarding the Alaskan Inuit population.

It's the methods used by (for example) the Japanese that I find inhumane and irresponsible that I personally disapprove of

What if they pass your lane, you start to proceed through, meanwhile the pedastrian (for multiple feasible reasons) decides to turn around and go back across your lane... You would get ticketed.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Let's paint that picture:  Our children have to compete with Chinese workers who earn around $5k per year (in today's dollars).

Our economy and society would have to adjust so that we live in shanty towns where a barder system is required because income levels are too low to support the cost of living.

But then there's the problem that because our kids can't afford to buy products, the whole consumer economy implodes. Our children find themselves in a world of massive poverty being suppressed by and living to serve a tiny super-elite.

I don't like that future. I like the future where our governments are strong enough to counter-balance corporate influence so that individuals can thrive rather than struggle to survive.

Bombers are a lot more expensive, but they're extremely useful for conventional warfare. Without them we'd have no combat aircraft with a range greater than 1,300 miles, which would be devastating for US power projection. If we're going to have bombers anyway, having the nuclear payload isn't that much more money. So very little savings there unless we get rid of bombers entirely.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","Thanks so fucking much for this serious reply! I´m going to break it down.

""because it looks like so much of you was wrapped up in being with her. ""

Yes. I realised pretty soon after that I was counting on her for my happiness. I even had said it to her multiple times that she was the ""source of my happiness"". Thought it was romantic then. Want to puke now when I think about it.

""What do you like to do? Do you exercise? Ride bikes? What kind of music do you really like (not what kind she would tolerate)? Can you cook?""

Yes I exercise and go skiing in the winter, ride my mountain bike in the summer. My biggest hobby though is that I am a drummer. I am actually in a pretty big metal band locally,it has thousands of likes on FB and we have been on europian tours and put out 2 LP on a worldwide record deal with a U.S. label. I know from countless shows that girls think I´m sexy when I play live, I can just see them staring at me. Also my gf used to fuck me so hard each time after she went to see a show of mine. It´s the first time that I am single and able to make a move on potential girls in the crowds at shows. It´s just that even though I play metal, I am really the last guy ever that you would think was a metalhead, I listen to gangsta rap and everything in between and dress like a totally normal guy. Don´t really wanna date metalchicks cause they all seem to have personal issues.

""All of this introspection and self-actualization will take your mind off the pain, which usually gets worse before getting better. ""

Even in the short time that has passed I already feel like I am learning so fucking much about myself and yes, thinking about game, going to the gym and how to amuse myself is the best working thing for me right now to not focus on the relationship ending. I was like totally over her,but now as you write that I get nervous that I might be not processing the whole thing enough and it will come crashing down on me later or something. I still think I should continue hitting on girls and fucking having fun while I can. If I break down all of a sudden I´ll just fucking take it.

""I understand...just ended a 4-year and I felt so dead. But I've gotten to know myself more than ever before, which has boosted my confidence and in turn led to women approaching me. ""

Would not mind that happening. I am still very happy with the good responses I´ve had from girls so far, but it´s only been like 3 weeks since I started thinking about game and I would love radiating enough energy that girls come up to me, and to have the balls to go for the perfect 10´s in no matter what situation.

""Which RSD video did you watch?""

I maybe shouldn´t have called it RSD, I don´t even know what that is. What I did watch was videos on Julien Blanc channel. The one that impacted me the most was this one; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAyZajdTGTU

I had tears of happyness after this one because it made me accept so deeply that it was over, and because it got me believing that I can get more girls, and made me fucking pumped to go out gaming. Have been watching many of his other videos since then.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Whether or not I had weed in my car is irrelevant. The weed in my car may as well be Schrodinger's cat to that first cop. Where the fuck did I say the cop could smell it from a mile away? You are just making shit up. The first cop could not smell the weed in my car or else he would have had probable cause to search my car and would have never let me go in the first place. What made him suspicious was that I told him that he could not search my car (which is well within my rights) and he told me I was free to go. So in that first officer's mind I had objectively done nothing wrong under the law to instigate a lawful search. That's not even the point I was making.

The point Psyanide14 made was exactly the point of my story. If a cop in this thread's situation were placing orange reminders in unlocked cars and they happen to smell some weed in one of the cars you can bet your fucking ass they will radio their associate officers to pull the guy over for some bullshit reason like in my story so that they can have a drug dog readily on hand to bust him ""legally"". And it will have all started because we think it's fine to allow officers to intrude into our unlocked cars. I am not here to argue the objective law as it is now, I am here to make the point that maybe the law should be changed. That there is a moral dilemma to be considered with the issue of privacy.

Pretend for a second that I actually didn't have weed in my car and I was just exercising my rights. What if they searched the car and found nothing? Then would you say the second officer was justified in pulling me over a second time in less than a few minutes or would you say at that point they were harassing me because I made their rookie feel like an idiot?

I don't need you to patronize me with your bullshit of ""If you do illegal things, you might get arrested"" and I am not asking you for anything. I never said I wasn't doing something illegal or that the law didn't work.

Yet it's still only at 7% market share and those are figures from Microsoft, it's likely less.

"PleX","t5_2ql7e","What I'm getting at is that I don't think it's cropping off any of the actual video.  (Or not enough that you'd notice, probably)

Your TV has an aspect ratio of 1.77:1 (also known as 16x9).

When you view video shot in that aspect ratio, it will fill the whole screen from top to bottom, and side to side.  (Most television is now shot in this format.  Many movies are shot in 1.85:1, which may crop a little off the top and bottom, but is probably not noticeable.)

When you view something shot in the old standard definition format, 1.33:1 (4x3), it will fill the screen top to bottom, and you'll get vertical black bars on the left and right of the picture.

On video formatted in 2.35:1 (21x9), the picture will span the entire width of the screen, and it will fill in the top and bottom with black bars.

This is normal behavior.  You can try adjusting the TV aspect ratio, cycling through the 5 different available settings:

* **Normal** preserves the content’s original aspect ratio. Since the
4:3 aspect ratio is not large enough to fill the TV’s screen, black bars are added to the left and right of the display image.

* **Stretch** expands the display image to fill the screen. Images may appear wider than intended. If you are watching widescreen (1.85:1 or 2.35:1) content, black bars will still appear on the top and bottom of the display
image. This option is only available when the TV is displaying a 720p/1080i/1080p source.

* **Panoramic** expands the display image to fill the width of the screen. Images may appear wider than intended. If you are watching widescreen (1.85:1 or 2.35:1) content, black bars will still appear on the top and bottom of the
display image. This option is only available when the TV is displaying a 480i/480p source.

* **Wide** stretches a 4:3 aspect ratio picture to the edges of the screen. Since the picture is being stretched, the display image may appear distorted. If the program is already formatted for widescreen viewing (1.85:1 or 2.35:1),
then black bars will appear on the top and bottom of the display image.

* **Zoom** expands images with black bars to fit the screen. Assuming you've ripped content from a DVD or Blu-ray, compare the picture from your disc player to what is shown from Plex.  You might be chasing a problem that you don't actually have.

If you're feeling really ambitious, post some pictures/screenshots.

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","So, if I were in your situation, I'd be thinking about the following things: 

Why did I quit drinking in the first place? 

Why did I find a subreddit called /r/stopdrinking?  

What happens when I drink?  

What are the costs/benefits of quitting?

Will I be capable of choosing a soda or tea instead of beer at this dinner?  If not, can I invite my friends to a location that doesn't serve alcohol, so I don't have the temptation?

That, off the top of my head is where I'd be at.  


For me, I take 24 hours at a time...sometimes just an hour...or 10 minutes at a time.  I've been pretty open and honest on this subreddit...and I've been through some serious life crap in the course of the past 493 days since my first /r/stopdrinking post.  I have grown to accept that the blessings I've found in sobriety are well worth keeping, and I'd lose a lot if I went back to drinking.  

I am not a person who can moderate.  Maybe for a few days...maybe a few weeks...I'd focus on whatever alcoholic algebra formula I'd create on how many drinks I'd allow myself...but inevitably, the numbers would creep up.  I don't want to be back into that horrible cycle again.  

So, yes.  For me, it is all, or nothing.  If I give up on staying sober, I will lose everything.  I don't want to be the person I used to be when drunk all the time.

"Accordion","t5_2s4ll","My 2¢

I'm currently working through the first Palmer Hughes book, and I'm very tickled with it. It has fairly steady progression in both playing and theory. The two down sides are the first few are written for children, which really just amounts to cheesy song lyrics and Highlights-like illustrations, and that they're written expecting you to have an instructor. Not that they don't introduce everything, but the fact I've trolled around ""how to's"" on YouTube definitely made the book more clear.

Unless you have access to a free piano, I don't think it would be worth the investment just to learn the right hand when that $ could go towards your accordion.  I'm no expert by far, but I don't think the little that would transfer would be worth it. Either your teaching your left hand things that are irrelevant or you're not practicing separating your hands. Plus, key size and horizontal vs verticle is something to consider. Of course, just IMO. 

If you really want to jump start your learning, I'm going to agree on finding a decent used accordion on eBay or craigslist. I understand the apartment thing, so it may limit how much you can practice, but depending on your timeline, even a 12 bass accordion would get you started and could be sold/traded upon finding your Roland.  

One thing to keep in mind if you do get a used accordion, it will probably be a stradella bass, which is what at least the Palmer Hughes books are written for.  I'm assuming if you're interested in the different instruments you want to assign that you'd be interested in free bass?

If its slowing down your computer it sounds like a graphics issue. Like some kind of geometry or shadow/detail issue that is glitching out causing your system to work a lot harder than it needs to. Maybe tweak your graphics settings? Like just for the shit of it turn stuff down to medium or some lower setting than you are using and see if it still happens(see what frames you get on these settings in another ship first) if you still see comparably worse performance then I guess send in a ticket. If you suddenly get similar performance to other ships then try to narrow down which setting in particular is causing it.

ALSO before you do anything, just remembered, try it without any mods installed if you have some in. Just c&amp;p the entire contents of your res_mods folder to the desktop or something temporarily and see if it still happens.

(ie: bob, layers, face framing, etc.)

And then when you're there, don't forget to bring cash to tip your stylist. You should do the typical 20%. ie: if your haircut is $50, give your stylist $10 in cash. That said, if there is a separate person washing your hair, you tip them too. If it's a cheap place (ie: Great Clips), a few bucks will do. But if you ever go high end salon, you would tip more.

You're only able to request egg moves, and if I'm not mistaken, or moves learned at level 1.

Here's an easy to read page that you can search other pokemon for their allowed level 1 moves and egg moves:

[Scizor](http://pokemondb.net/pokedex/scizor)

* note - The level 1 assumption is only because I requested a Gyarados and because he has 0 egg moves, when genning a pokemon it needs to have something associated with it and in substitution they applied anything learnable at level 1.

When you're working on and off for the entire day like you are, you put your spouse in a position where they never know if they'll be able to interact with you without you being busy.  My bf has had a few periods like this, and I end up feeling like I can't interact with him or ask him to do anything at all, all day long.  Either he's busy and I don't want to interrupt him, or he's taking a break and I'd just be contributing to his procrastination.  And on top of that, he won't initiate any quality time, so I'm left sitting there wondering if I'll even get to have a conversation with him this evening or not.  Luckily, this only happens infrequently for us (usually when my bf is taking time off of work to study for a technical interview).

The upcoming battletech game and catalyst seem to be using very similar designs, if not identical ones. You can further see this in the way Alex Iglesias has drawn the marauder very closely to shimmeringsword's version used by catalyst. The fun factoid here also is that shimmeringsword had earlier participated in the community marauder concept poll, where his (different at the time) design lost out to some less-interesting options.

All of this is to say that the next crops of battletech miniatures will be  heavily influenced by mwo designs. And I am hoping that they will be produced with the scale relative to each other preserved.","1443657739"

DC has the highest disparity between rich and poor in the USA. People live there for connections and job opportunities. Those who make less than $15 an hour live in Maryland and Alexandria VA.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The government requires permission from the elected officials in order to pay it's bills.  It's important here to make the distinction between 2 kinds of ""government"".  There's the hundreds of thousands of individuals who work for the US federal government. 

The gardiner at a national park, an FBI agent, a marine, a CIA officer, a diplomat, a pension worker, a tax collector, all of these individuals work for the federal government.  They are hired, not elected.

Then there's the people who are elected.  Now, America elects lots of lower level positions, but in this case I'm talking about congress.  Congress passes laws, those laws include laws that give the government employees permission to write cheques to pay for things, and to collect taxes from individuals. 

It's this ""permission to spend money"" that we're talking about here.  The permission that congress gives is normally for 1 year and happens when they pass the budget.  It's congress signing off on the plan for how to spend money, then they instruct the workers to go spend it that way. 

Shutting down the government means congress has not given the government employees permission to spend money.  They are not allowed to pay for ANYTHING, including wages and salary. 

Since it's illegal to ask a worker to come to work if you'er not going to pay them for that work, the government workers are all told not to come to work, stay home, government closed for businesses. 

Not all workers get this treatment.  Some departments are considered essential and so they will stick around.  The secret service does not really get to just not come to work, for example.

But something like 90% of the hundreds of thousands of employees are told to stay home.  No work gets done and everything grinds to a halt.

Food Stamps? that's a federal program and it relies on government employees to process the paperwork involved in making those payments.  So that simply stops.  Anyone who was counting on food stamps to, you know, eat, ends up with no food stamps. ","1443657744"

**Reported Rapes**

A. Based on United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) data from 2012: 

* 24,923 reported rapes in India, or 4.26 reported rapes for every 1,00,000 women

* This places India at 85 out of 121 countries.

B. 53.2 per cent rape cases filed between April 2013-July 2014 false, says Delhi Commission for Women [1](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/false-rape-cases-in-delhi-delhi-commission-of-women/1/409320.html) [2](http://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2exabd/the_hindu_did_a_3_part_analysis_on_rape_cases_in/)

This video discusses above the above statistics: [Rapes are over-hyped in India](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdGUPTub-L0&amp;index=90&amp;list=WL)

Also see this: [The culture of rape in India must change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdoeoU48DIg)

**Unreported Rapes**

C. Based on a survey conducted by UN Women:

* India reported 8.5 rapes for every 100 women over their lifetimes, based on the answers they gave household-level surveyors. 

* The question  ""if the women had experienced sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner or any other person"" placed India at 39 out of 99 countries.

* Ten per cent of women in India reported having experienced sexual violence by their husbands during their lifetime. In the UN Women database, this places India at 43 out of 86 countries with comparable data. 

[Source](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-rape-rhetoric-and-reality/article6705077.ece)

**Rape Conviction Rate**

According to the Guardian, just 7% of reported rapes in the U.K. resulted in convictions during 2011-12. In Sweden, the conviction rate is as low as 10%. France had a conviction rate of 25% in 2006. Poor India, a developing nation with countless challenges, managed an impressive 24.2% conviction rate in 2012. That’s thanks to the efforts of a lot of good people — police, lawyers, victims and their families — working heroically with limited resources.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I appreciate the effort, Rheingold. It is indeed exciting that kindred communities can share the love of their content. Awesome to hear of a LoL player enjoying The International.

I don't think I will watch LoL Worlds, though. Because LoL had more players and bigger prize pools, I was curious to see what the game would be like. However, the cartoony graphics are a major turn-off (I imagine Final Fantasy fans love them). I don't really feel I can see what's going on, and everything just seems like a bunch of similar-looking characters blinking around and spamming missiles at each other. I guess that's one reason why LoL players might enjoy watching Dota, even without knowing the game; you can clearly see what's going on and feel there's a story to the action. 

Reading through the comments here, it seems the general consensus that people like LoL either because it's the first MOBA they played and because it's simpler than Dota. I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise for me, coming from Warcraft 3 and later the Starcraft communities. The games were going places, had an exciting scene for years, but Starcraft always seemed limited because people would find it so hard to play, which would mean that the players pool would be limited despite it basically being a national sport of Korea at one time. Despite a boost at the start, SC2 started declining, and the scene started to get stale, which is why I started watching Dota instead 2-3 months ago. Earlier, I was disheartened when I saw that some SC2 pros quit to start playing Dota, which seemed silly, but now I'm excited about it. I didn't credit Dota enough in terms of the skill the game entails, but I guess it all falls into perspective :)","1443657748"

And I agree, 100%. If you don't like 1 thing about something, no matter how small or insignificant, you should just give up on that thing. You certainly shouldn't expect that thing to change, nor should you try to change it. You shouldn't try to bring attention to the shitty part, now should you even think about trying to make that part better. And, whatever you do, if you paid money for something and then had that thing fundamentally change so as to be unusable, you certainly shouldn't be angry or anything. Your money and opinions are unimportant and you should just shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down because if you don't /u/apostate9 will chastise you condescendingly and tell you what a bad person you are for not agreeing with him/her and having the exact same likes and dislikes as him/her.

Remember kids, disagreeing with people on the internet is not allowed, and you should never ever do it. It's cool if they disagree with you, because you're obviously wrong.

EDIT: Also, non-sarcastically, I should mention that I am still 100% right with my initial assessment. EVERY SINGLE MMO THAT HAS EVER EXISTED EVER THAT FORCED PVP INTO A PREVIOUSLY PVE ACTIVITY HAS GONE INTO STEEP DECLINE SHORTLY AFTER DOING THAT THING. Most have died shortly after, some have just gone into ""no new content basically ever"" mode. ESO will NOT be immune to this.

The thing that most people, like you, just don't understand is that the vast, overwhelming majority of MMO players HATE PvP. Like, it's not that they don't like it much or that they don't like it in certain places or they like it but only when it's in instanced areas (aka battlegrounds from WoW). Nope...they fucking HATE it. They NEVER want to engage in ANY form of PvP EVER and they will actively avoid games that force them to engage in PvP in ANY way, what-so-ever-at-all.

You can say I'm lying, but literally every data point on this issue agrees with me. ALL of them. The very first thing to die in ANY MMO that has started the inevitable downward spiral to death is PvP. Hardcore PvPers are always a TINY fraction of the playerbase when compared to hardcore PvErs. Etc etc etc etc.

So when ESO decides it's gana start catering more to PvPers and less to PvErs and taking PvE activities and turning them into PvP activities, you better believe that ESO will NOT be the new EVE (the ONLY MMO ever that is an exception to the above) and instead will die the same horrible painful death that every other MMO that does this kind of shit dies.

So yeah, be all smug and shit now. And when the change happens, I hope you enjoy the 6 months to a year you'll have to play with it on servers that see massive populations drops everyday, while a company that can't afford to keep the lights on in the offices that make this game much less make new content for it slowly sheds people and eventually shutters it's doors. And when it happens, at least it couldn't be happening to a more douchey group of PvP nutters. ESO's PvP community is just awful, and you deserve whatever happens.","1443657748"

"Rivenmains","t5_34n26","Uh, I tested it out on PBE. **NO** damage was changed on **ANY** part of her kit **EXCEPT** for her ult. Everything about Riven is the same except the Edge mechanic and her Ult. This means, imo, it's a small buff. I did the math on her ult if you want to look at it.

""On live, Riven's ult damage currently increases by 2.67% per 1% hp the target is missing. So for every 25% health missing, your ult does 66.75% more damage. This caps at 75% health missing for a total of 200% damage increase. You can look at the new ult as Edge=Health missing. Each stack of 20 Edge causes your ult to do the equivalent of the opponent missing 15% of their HP. So the scaling is like this 20/40/60/80/100 Edge and 40%/80%/120%/160%/200%.""

Oh, and Jungle Riven is perfectly fine since her damage wasn't changed. The only nerf to jungle Riven is if you use your Ult on camps. Only nerf to Riven in general that I can see is that you can no longer use your ult to steal dragon/baron from over the wall.","1443657750"

I know its hard at the moment,  but try not to dwell on the unknown - you could have an incredibly straight forward 3rd tri and aside from the usual discomforts, have little or no complications.

While he is personally upset when he realizes his investiture was just some political fencing between Aerys and his father, he is genuinely offended when Aerys betrays the trial by combat system to execute Brandon and Rickard Stark, and disillusioned when Hightower demands that he tolerate such actions.

With one fatal blow, he hit my partner. I could tell he was dead straight off.

Before I could pull the trigger, I was hit by lightning and bitten by a cobra. I blacked out, and saw images of ancient Shaolin temples and monks mastering the art of kung-fu. There was an ancient prophecy about a new form of kung-fu so powerful, only one man can master it: The Chosen One. When I woke up, I saw the kung-fu master running towards me. I could feel my body mutate, into some sort of kung-fu freak of nature....

As a memento, I put on a strip of cloth from the dead kung-fu master. I decided I would use my new super kung-fu powers to fight crime. So I became the best cop in the world. I became Kung Fury.

"fivenightsatfreddys","t5_331ct","1) GO! GO! GO! shows 5 children at Pirate Cove being murdered by Purple Guy, their bodies being left in the open. Give Gifts, Give Life shows 4 kids in a back room, their bodies hidden from the public. It's pretty obvious that these are two separate incidents, since their conditions don't meet up whatsoever. Plus, GO! GO! GO! most likely takes place between FNAF 2 and 1, considering the disrepair of Foxy's legs in this minigame. This incident is explaining why Pirate Cove became ""Out of Order"" in FNAF 1, since a lot of people at the time of Pre-FNAF 2 thought the reason was because Foxy caused the Bite of '87, which is obviously not the case. And that still doesn't explain why the 5th kid just shows up out of nowhere in Give Gifts, Give Life.

2) Listen, I don't want to get into another Fredbear =/= Golden Freddy argument, so I won't go into too much detail. But...come on, really? They're both golden, both a secret 5th animatronic in FNAF 1 and FNAF 4 respectively, both transform into giant, floating heads, one is in use before the Bite and one is decommissioned after the Bite, it all adds up. 

The only difference between them is the color of their hats, but that can already be proven irrelevant by their names themselves. 

- ""Fredbear"" is a different character from Freddy, evidenced by them being separate in the Fredbear &amp; Friends ad. He has a purple hat to show this. 

- ""Golden Freddy"" is the same character as Freddy. After the Bite, the company probably wouldn't want anything to do with the Fredbear name, so they tried to convert the suit to make it more like Freddy(explaining why the hat was changed to black), before scrapping the idea and sticking with the Toy animatronics, leaving ""Golden Freddy"" to rot with the other Withereds. 

And I already know the argument you're going to use against this is that ""there's no evidence"". That's because it's an assumption based on pre-existing evidence. It's called a ""theory"", if you're not familiar.

3) Okay, but the Withered location was still open during FNAF 4, evidenced by the Fredbear &amp; Friends commercial. Fazbear Ent. wouldn't be running a commercial for an old and abandoned resturant with characters that they've already decommissioned and replaced. 

However, that doesn't explain why the Withereds were decommissioned in Summer 1987, while FNAF 4 occurred in Summer 1987 as well. Do you have an explanation for this? I've looked at it from both our perspectives, but with the ad showing that they're still in use, I can't come up with anything.

About 6 months later, I randomly stopped in a comic shop in the Valley just to look around. I was looking at the most current issue of Flash at that time when some guy also shopping there walked up and asked me what I thought of the book.

I explained I wasn't reading them, and had quit when Waid left. The guy grabbed the 6 issues on the shelf that I hadn't read, brought them up to the counter, bought them, then handed them to me. He said ""If you like them, keep buying"". And left the store.

Croats and Slovenes, catholic nationalities with closer historical ties with the West, needed to keep Serbs in check. There was unofficial saying ""weak Serbia - strong Yugoslavia"". Simply put, Serbian nationalism was seen as a threat to Yugoslav unity. To some extent, same could be said for Croatian nationalism - those two were the most important nations in Yugoslavia. Carving out two provinces out of Serbia (which were like republics in many aspects) was meant to level the playing field, and to shrink the relative influence of Serbia.

As for Belgrade, it was a logical choice, really. By far the largest city; was capital of Kingdom of Yugoslavia; had the infrastructure of a capital city etc...","1443657759"

In fact, of all the Origins 5, Jace is probably the one who has improved the most. Gideon's ""Limits"" article set him up to be really cool, but he's fallen a bit flat since then; he's kinda following the ""inspirational leader"" trope a bit too closely. Liliana is basically the same as ever, which is ""pretty interesting"", but she's not relevant to the immediate plot. Chandra has improved, what with the ""accepting responsibility"" thing at Keral Keep, but we haven't seen much of her. Nissa's character, of course, has been obliterated by the need to not make one of Magic's main protagonists a racist; she has done nothing since then but make me hate her more.","1443657760"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","&gt; but the RBA mandate is to not interfere in that. By [spending money into existence] they are directly interfering in the worth of the currency

All spending has the risk of interfering with the worth of the currency. The government may indeed push total spending over the productive capacity of the economy if it doesn't offset enough private spending through taxes.

&gt;QE

So are we talking about ""spending money into existence"" or are we talking about QE? I'm not sure if you're deliberately confusing matters or genuinely don't understand that they are completely different things.

&gt; Whether you are producing physical currency or putting zeros on a ledger, it is still the same outcome.

No, the outcome for misinformers like yourself is that people will see or hear the phrase ""printing money"" and immediately think of hyperinflation in Weimar Germany or Zimbabwe. You're exploiting general ignorance about fiscal operations to scare people into supporting austerity.

&gt; lol, that's an incredibly simplistic thing to say.

&gt; (3) obtaining a written statement signed by the

Would a signed form resubmitted not qualify? Seems odd they would require the document to be printed and sent by mail otherwise. 

Facebook probably wouldn't work, but from the text itself it's pretty vague on the database requirements. Just says ""must be a commercially available database"". In other words, you cant create your own database to use for the verification system, it must be available to everyone. Whether paid or free, so long as it is available. 

As far as the ID goes, lets say a 20 year old wants to purchase juice online from Texas. He takes a picture of his ID and loads it up into photoshop. Changes the date on it, leaves everything the same. Uses his card to pay &amp; delivers it to his address on his ID. On delivery USPS can tell he's legally an adult (18+), and lets him sign for it. I didn't read the complete thing yet, but I would assume USPS isn't going to be expected to know exactly what's in the package and checking ID's for the state to ensure the signer is 21+. I'd be surprised if that were the case, but it's not completely out of the realm of possibility, I just wouldn't think USPS would care to go through tracking exactly what's in every package going into the state of texas.

"csgobetting","t5_2zume","Property vs CSGL

BO2

CSGO Lounge Link: http://csgolounge.com/match?m=5895

Property is a team that performs much better in BO2s than in other formats. Property lost 2-0 to Mous, 2-0ed Orbit and traded maps in a BO2 with Vexxed, Nerdrage and CW. Most of Property's BO2s end up in ties. CSGL has been looking fairly solid. Although they had a bad game against Reason they lost a close 0-2 to Flipsid3, 2-0ed Max and Relax and lost 1-2 to CW. CSGL have been looking like a solid tier two team. As Property usually ties their BO2s I give CSGL 60/40 odds. If odds are around 60/40 for CSGL you can go low on them and if they are around 70/30 for CSGL you should go low on Property.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I did a tandum jump. IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCE EVER. We got there and had to sign papers that basically said 'if you die it's not our fault', then we waited around for a bit before we were taken in to watch a video about sky diving. After that we went to get training. They told us the position to hold our arms and body in, had us practice jump off this little thing, went over the altimeter and at what altitude we would be pulling the chute, what the landing would be like, and I'm sure other things that I cannot think of right now. We also got all our gear on during this training. After the training we boarded the plane, 20-25 of us including the experts we would be jumping with. There was no room for me in the back of the plane so I got to ride shotgun with the pilot! Everyone else just sat on the floor in the back of the plane. There were no seats. After we got to altitude everyone got hooked up to their expert and started throwing themselves out of the plane.  I jumped last. Except I didn't really jump. I hesitated for a second, but the guy on my back kept going, so I was just kind of forced out of the plane lol.  The free fall was cold (went in May in New Jersey), and LOUD. My ears seriously hurt on the ride home. I would suggest some sort of ear protection for sure. So, the free fall was awesome and thrilling. I had pictures and a DVD made, so the guy that took the pictures jumped out right before me. During the free fall he took my hand and we spun, it was awesome! But my favorite part was after the chute was pulled.  There was just something so amazing about having a conversation with the dude on my back while we floated through the air and down to earth.  My instructor was pointing things out, told me the city in the distance was Philly. Then we had to land, which I was scared of doing, I thought it might hurt. It didn't, though. Then we waited for then to process the DVD and photos and when we got them we went to watch them on their TV. And that's about it! I highly recommend it! 

Edit: I just saw the other question in your post. My friend is SO SCARED of roller coaster and stuff. She cried before going on that slingshot ride they have at fairs, she cried in her seat on Kingda Ka. She was scared but after we got on the plane she was totally composed, didn't cry. It didn't make sense! She said she was just way more excited than she was scared.","1443657766"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Your focus on what you call ""well rounded aspects"" is really strange to me as a Brit.

A US college (Ivy League) admissions tutor came to talk at my school and mentioned that the entry requirements might change from year to year - ""for example, one year most of the brass band might have graduated and we'd be looking for new players"".

This is completely opposite to the attitude we have in the UK with regards to university, where entrance is usually based on academic performance (and sometimes a largely academic interview) and nothing else. That talk really put me off applying to the US.

That's not to say schools and universities don't provide extracurricular activities and sports, it's just that they're not a big focus unless you have outstanding talent.","1443657767"

&gt; 

Yeah, OP, you don't say what sort of position you're in financially/living space-wise, but this is worth thinking about. Your parents are intentionally inflicting emotional distress on your brother by telling him you're dead. I don't know that that would be enough to rise to the level of child abuse for something like CPS to intervene, but it *is* emotional abuse. 

Shit may also hit the fan when you reveal to your extended family that you're not, in fact, dead. If your parents know that you've stayed in touch with your brother, they'll probably know that he's responsible for telling you that they were spreading these rumors. That's not necessarily a reason to not tell your grandparents, but it is something to consider.","1443657767"

The Yonko are only considered Yonko becuase they are the most powerful who cancel each other out, so none of them can keep progressing toward the One Piece.  They're stuck because of each other.  Before there was a One Piece, there was nothing that they were competing for other than general treasure, etc.  That's not to say there still weren't ridiculously strong pirates (White Beard was a contemporary of Roger after all, and they fought all the time).  Same thing with the Schibuki.  They exist because the WG was looking for a way to ease the pressure coming from all of the pirates swarming into the Grande Line going after the One Piece.  Easier to commission a strong pirate to take out a bunch of the smaller pirates before they become too much trouble.  Obviously the downside (which we're seeing now) is that the strong pirates are still pirates, and have their own motivations.  But until you had a constant stream of pirates entering the Grande Line, the WG didn't need the Schibuki.","1443657768"

Its important to recall that all light is an electromnetic waves results from the (disturbance) moving of charges in space and the electric field all around us, but at its ground state =0. If the wave packet (the disturbance in the EM field) has a group frequency with a suitable number of ossilations per unit time, in the case of IR light these oscillation in the EM field field are relatively slow and weak, compared to say X-rays. These disturbances like waves can excite these vibrational modes, of the electrons in the bonds of molecules. These modes are quantized in energy similarly to harmonic frequencies notes of a musical instruments.

Basically playing a musical instrument. Blowing in air at resonant harmonic frequencies brings about sustained consistent notes. Only difference here is that EM waves that are not of these frequencies have no effect on the vibrational modes of a molecule

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Feminism isn't the gate keeper of the term Patriarchy.  It was in common use long before feminism was even a thing (First recorded use was in the 1600's).  Its use then is no different from it's common use today - that is describing a social system controlled by men.

I'd understand (thought still not agree with) Feminism's definition if it was even remotely related to it's common usage.  If the word has evolved so much as there to be very little (if any) connection with it's roots, maybe a new term should  be used.

&gt; Also, feminists absolutely recognize that women can reinforce gender norms (one common phrase to look out for, especially in earlier work, is ""internalized patriarchy""; other work will just call it ""perpetuating gender norms"" and things like that). 

But they are still doing it in a way that isolates a woman from the responsibility of her actions/views.  They are still putting the ultimate blame on men.  About the only time I've seen ""internalized patriarchy"" used is by also calling the woman a victim.  ""You are just a victim of internalized patriarchy.""

I get that at one point in time using the term patriarchy, with it's common definition, was valid.  But not today.  Women have as much control over society, including it's leaders, as men do.  Women today are in full control of what they wear, how they act, and what they think.  Blaming the patriarchy as the reason does nothing more than belittle a woman's agency and once again puts a woman's welfare back on to a man's shoulders.

&gt; People are punished for moving outside their box

I'd say that people allow themselves to be punished.  Granted it seems to be out of style, but ""Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me"" is a great saying.  Words are empowered by how we react to them.  If we don't react, then the words have no power.

To the best of my knowledge, words are all we're dealing with when it comes to fitting into defined roles.  I'd hardly call that being punished or forced.  The words of a grandmother raised in a true patriarchy should have zero influence on her granddaughter choosing putting career before family.

&gt; Using ""society"" however would be even worse -- because it has a ton of connotations of it's own

I have yet to see 'patriarchy' used on Reddit in a way that precludes swapping it for 'society'.  In fact more often than not 'society' would be more accurate.  By it's very nature, a discussion about gender roles is already discussing gender.  There's no need to sow confusion by using a unique definition of a word that most people understand to mean something else.  'Society' works just fine.

Remember, we're not in a classroom or even in the commons of a university.  We're yapping on one of the world's largest public forums.  A forum that also hosts links to videos of people fucking dogs.

&gt; As well as which, it's important to realize that feminism has historical roots, and a lot of the language has been inheritted from that.

If only today's Feminists would get in touch with more of their roots rather than stubbornly redefine a word.

Anyways I appreciate you coming back and talking about the subject rather than making it personal.  Now I'm really leaving the thread.  Getting death threats from your fellow Feminists.

Who says for example that the current equipment which was developed for men is the optimal choice for women? Maybe making a few things lighter would enhance survival rates and performance. Who knows, is anybody even thinking about this stuff?

But you can't really blame the military for this. Current dominant ideologies do not allow a rational discussion and evaluation.

"mbti","t5_2s90r","I don't know what to think about compatibility charts. I usually tend to go off personal experience. 
They say ENTP (me) would ideally get along with INFJ and INTJ. 

My mother is the only INFJ I've ever known well, and the INFJ guy I talked to was boring as fuck. 

I'm gonna say I really don't like my dad, but he's a very unhealthy INTJ. I had an INTJ friend that turned into an absolute bitch towards me with no warning and without me even doing anything wrong. Just one day she hated me? 

So. I don't really like my 'recommended' types. 

Three of my exes are ESTP's. They were fun, but we never really 'clicked' like I have with fellow intuitives. Probably because I was raised by intuitives. Except for one ex, which was an INFP, we never, EVER understood one another. It was awful. 

My current boyfriend is an ISFJ, and I love him and the relationship. It's awesome. He's interestingly boring and fun at the same time, it's difficult to explain. I know him, but he keeps so much inside, but I trust him. He can plan everything and keeps up with me and my schedule better than I do. I've definitely attended appointments that I would have missed without his reminders. He's kind of the person that comes along behind me with a fire extinguisher when I just happen to spontaneously explode an idea/experiment. 


In short, I seem to do well with Sensing/Judging types.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Honestly it's right to get upset about these kinds of things because it indicates the teacher is either effectively letting her pride in front of a group of children undermine her ability to actually educate you or is too incompetent to know, or even reference, the material she is teaching.  As well she is undermining the confidence of students that actually go out of their way to succeed, showing that it counts for nothing unless your superiors agree.  That is not something that any parent should just lay down and accept, and since the kids are powerless to do anything it falls on you to do something.   

Now there is a difference between that and the parents who hound the teacher because their little johnny is failing and has never failed at anything.   Not all children are exceptional, and if you're going to confront someone make sure they are actually in the wrong first, and that the problem isn't the fact that your child hasn't studied for a second in their life and spends the entirety of class talking about how to snort Ritalin.

If they'd have left it there I probably would have stayed just tickled, as positively portrayed LGBTQ in MCU is beyond overdue. 

That the writers have had to shoehorn not only that, but also how his preferences have engendered his own personal perspective on closeting, so that they also could advance allegorical social commentary (edit: albeit a direly needed messaging granted and agreed) is problematic. Had some diversity in this regard already existed from another character? Take for instance: were Daisy, Coulson, or Mack established as LGBTQ previously where we had seen how these issues effecting that community impacted them already (with Coulson having to hide his existence again, Daisy's foster child background, or Mack's fear of unknown repression further explored), they wouldn't have had to strain so to introduce diversity for intersectionality's sake. They could have linked same themes without all the expositional gymnastics. They felt they needed someone with this Other difference so that they could present their commentary differently, see?

However, if the policy is immediately rewritten by the same insurer, generally the short rate would be waived.

You absolutely do NOT want a gap in coverage.

'No. I mean yes. You aren't supposed to know that. -2 x -2 is 4 and that you can't take the square root of a negative number. So class, you can't take the square root of a negative number. We'll learn about imaginary numbers later'.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;stop subsidizing the screening and the medical care, and lower taxes accordingly. Then, those poor people can appeal to charity to receive help peacefully.

When your objective is to reduce the spread of STDs and increase reproductive help, why would you just reduce taxes and hope that people just stumble upon this wonder charity.  

It makes a lot more sense that you would create your own organization specifically designed to STD testing and reproductive health at lower rates to incentivize these people to come.  

Another option is to subsidize the cost of these procedures at current providers but this is not as good as the first because providers will likely raise prices accordingly to your subsidies making the government spend more money.  

&gt;But food stamps and welfare increase unwanted pregnancy by removing part of the negative consequences. It also lessens the inventive to find a good partner because the government is there to act as a provider, which also messes with the mental health of children who grow up without a father.

I think most people out there are not saying lets have a baby so I can start raking in all the public assistance money.  [An extra $133 dollars a month](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/avg-monthly-food-stamp-benefits/) for having a baby seems hardly worth it.  The responsibilities and costs of having a baby pale in comparison to the amount of assistance that you receive.  You also have to weigh the possible benefit that getting rid of food stamps might dissuade someone from having a pregnancy (when they don't know how to use contraception) vs the millions of women and children this would cause to start starving.  Children can hardly ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"" and learn when they are begging on the street for food.  

This is all ignoring the fact that I am not talking about food stamps I am talking about Planned Parenthood, and as i explained before one of the points of Planned Parenthood is to subsidize the cost of reproductive health/ contraception and educate women on their options and how to use contraception so that you can reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies that are a burden to the woman and a burden to the government.  


Government cost
$600 IUD vs $133/month food stamps for a child.

Also just to cut this off at the pass. You can not start receiving these food stamp benefits until you actually have the baby. [You can not claim an unborn baby as a dependent](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1984395-is-my-unborn-child-a-dependent).  The idea that women were somehow getting pregnant and getting federal aid, and then getting abortions started a few years ago, and it is complete crap.  You can not get federal aid for your unborn child, and even if you could the abortion is completely unsubsidized by federal money meaning you will have to pay more than 1000 dollars for an abortion.  So this means even if you only paid $1000 dollars(which is low) for your abortion and had a very late term abortion at the end of 5 months, you would have only earned around $700 in food.  Meaning you would have lost money from this scheme.","1443657784"

"korea","t5_2qiog","I linked the report much earlier in the thread. But they don't qualify the numbers by tiers. As I said, you could possibly make up any number you want. These values give a skewed view of what the general cost would be. They give a value of $438 USD a day for a business traveller here and then someone uses that number to claim that the city is expensive. It's just simply false. 3 star hotel, food, a cab to and from work, a coffee or two, should be no more than $200-$220 about half that for a standard business worker. It's clear that these rankings are probably for much higher up business people, but they don't actually write that anywhere so we have to discuss as its worded. That it's the cost of sending a business person here in general and I just don't buy it. 

If they wanted to create tiered rankings and actually detail those, that would be another thing. I think $438 is probably a good number for a high level manager or other exec. For a standard worker you send over, I think it's way too excessive. 

The food budget is an actual one that the company I used to work for provided. You got $50/day whether you used it or not. OR you could choose to submit receipts for actual costs. Many people took a hotel with a free breakfast, had a light lunch for around $10, then had dinner for $20-$25 and banked the remainder. Over a couple weeks they could get an extra $200-$300 off their trip. If you went to certain areas and countries the per day amount was increased by $25. If people took really long trips they rent a place with a kitchen, buy groceries which was much cheaper and bank like $1000 extra off the trip.

"korea","t5_2qiog","We have a bit in common.  Like you, I'm also married to a woman who is significantly more attractive than me.  And while I wouldn't call myself ugly, I'm balding (and have been noticeably since I was 17).  Strangely, it's slowed down in Korea... maybe all that rice.  Balding throughout university really helps you understand how completely unfair life can be when it comes to looks.  But as you probably know, losing your hair is something that bothers you less as you get older.  I don't even mind it at all now that I'm in my 30s.  

1.  I guess I didn't see the false dichotomy, but maybe it was there.  Nonetheless, all other things being equal (character, job, etc.), being attractive is preferable to being unattractive.  

2.  Fair enough.

3.  Braces might have some medical benefits, but in reality they are primarily cosmetic.  A quick google search for ""orthodontist ad"" shows almost all of them pushing attractive smiles.  A few even talk about boosting confidence.  None of them talk about medical benefits.  Let's be honest: braces and other similar orthodontist work are mostly about having nice looking teeth.  Is deriving *all* of your self-worth from your appearance wrong?  Perhaps.  *Some* of your self-worth?  Not really.  Most people like looking good.  Wearing a nice sport coat with freshly shined shoes just makes me feel better.  No, that's not surgical, but it helps me see how having plastic surgery to permanently look ""better"" could help some people feel better about themselves.

4.  Yes, an ""anything is fine"" stance is just as arbitrary as ""everything is bad.""  But a stance of ""some things are okay (e.g. braces), but other similar things are bad (e.g. eyelid surgery)"" seems hypocritical.  Braces are acceptable in the US because we (oddly) place a high value on nice straight teeth.  Eyelid surgery is acceptable in Korea because they place a high value on big eyes with a double fold.  I don't see either one as being better or worse than the other.  

Like I said, I do find excessive ""lookism"" to be a very bad thing.  I also personally find excessive plastic surgery procedures like rhinoplasty and jaw reshaping to be kind of fucked up.  But is it objectively *wrong?*  That I can't say.  I've come around to sort of understanding why some people do it, even though it would never be for me.

If they keep on ODing, they should be treated for addiction.

Fett and Jaster eventually get into a gunfight at night which Jaster wins, killing Boba Fett. Usng Fetts helmet, he claims the bounty on himself. Last scene is Jaster walking away from an unmarked grave wearing Fetts armor. As he does, he gives the ""everyone dies"" speech in voice over. 

Tldr: Last One Standing from Tales of the Bounty Hunters is canon again. Clone fett killed off and replaced by original Fett.

"geopolitics","t5_2qhnn","It wouldn't surprise me, but remember that facebook is probably scraped and indexed by NSA, CIA, FSB, MSS, Mossad and a whole bunch of others - specially to prevent Facebook from inserting past-dated profiles. Want to research somebody? Check their facebook entries from 2010, then check your own indexes to see if those entries actually existed in 2010.

Next you can use wordprint analysis to see if the profiles were likely to have been written by a computer or if they have the hallmarks of being an amalgam of other posts. Then check the indexed passenger manifests - their status says ""loving Australia!"" in 2011. Did anybody with that name actually fly to Australia on those dates? And so on and so on and so on.

What is *probably* happening is something akin to shelf corporations, the practice of people creating corporations and then keeping the registrations current for several years then selling them to somebody who needs to use a corporation that has ""existed"" for several years. It would not surprise me in the slightest that there are people who sit around all day just making up stuff to post on Facebook and Twitter and grindr (joking!) in real time to be part of a long con, deep cover agent who is recruited 5, 10 years into the future. With these identities already established, and scraped, when the future agent is recruited they are given an identity that has already existed and ""been active"" for years before they become an agent.

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","I've called home several times but mom seems pretty reluctant. Even I ask myself what I expect her to do, since the girl is technically doing her work and passing the class.

The misbehaviors are defiance, disrespect, and disruptiveness. Example: She refuses to sit down because she ""hates this class."" I give her the consequence for getting out of her seat, she yells ""I don't care!"" The consequence for that is a phone call home. I then pull her out and we talk, ""I just don't like you. I just don't like this class."" ""That's not a solution. We need to figure something out."" ""Just don't talk to me."" etc

She's not doing anything absurd that I feel the need to write up, but the overall defiance has been insanely hard to crack.","1443657795"

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","It's a dog sport!  You test your dog's instinct to be a rodent finder.  They put a pet rat in a PVC tube and hide it, and your dog has to find it buried in a hay bale course. Your dog has to find a rat (or multiple rats) without hitting the decoy tubes, as well as complete a tunnel and jumping on a bale of hay within a designated time limit.

It's really new and friendly to all sorts of dogs (you don't need to have a purebred to title in it at all) and as long as your dog can fit under a hay bale tunnel and older than 6 months, then it is eligible to compete.  Dogs as big as Newfoundlands, GSDs, Belgian Shepherds, and Dobermans do BH successfully!

When my dog showed instinct at it, I made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3bibs8/help_my_dog_is_a_natural_at_barn_hunt_what_now/) with a lot of good advice and also since then, /u/KestrelLowing did a great writeup of it a few weeks ago which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3hbskd/discussion_barn_hunt_an_introduction/).","1443657798"

But if it's on a meteor that opens up a whole bunch of different questions than if it's on Mars.  Like where did the meteor come from? How old is it? How long has the life been growing on it? Is there life everywhere? Even on tiny wet rocks with no particular gravity or atmosphere at all? Did it come from a planet that had life or a bigger meteor that had life or can life evolve even in just the sparseness of space? 

If we find life on Mars you have to wonder did it start on Mars and come to Earth or vice versa? Could it be completely independent evolution? If so what are the similarities on a cellular level? Is there some sort of parallelism or is it radically different? ","1443657798"

I went in, my appointment took about 15 minutes i dont remember the doctors name but he was great. then it took me about 15 minutes to pick out glasses. They gave me my prescription and my pupil measurements free of charge. My eyes aren't too bad so I was $110 total for exam ($70) and glasses ($39). Fast forward to this past weekend. I convinced my girlfriend that she should go in and get new ones as well. So she called made an appointment. We went in on Saturday morning for her appointment. The lady that she had doing her exam kept yelling at her that she was saying that the wrong one was better when she was asking her to compare. Yelled at her to the point that she made her cry. She forgot that we hadn't paid yet or else she would have walked out. She made it through it though. Her eyes are considerably worse than mine and she isn't a fan of thick frames so her glasses cost a bit more. $120 for her glasses. Ryan the manager of the glasses department was awesome to us though. So we will probably go back but we will definitely not use the lady doctor for anything ever again.","1443657799"

I think what puts most people off is their videos for the actual fights themselves, like when Samus used the freeze ray without her power armor. That's not a big deal to me because the actual animation is just there to have a way to stand out and show off how their moves would fair against each other. It doesn't actually determine the result, the result determines the animation, something a lot of people don't seem to get (not necessarily you, just a lot of people who disagree with their results argue against things in the animation). For instance in the Samus / Boba Fett fight they it was pretty clear once she broke out the freeze ray Boba was screwed, so they used it as a finisher even though it didn't really make sense.

It's a way of making a fight presentable and exciting even if it would just be seal clubbing if done practically. For instance if they ever did the Enterprise versus a Star Destroyer the fight would have both sides use every weapon they have, and make it look like a close match (like superman vs. Goku where Superman out classes Goku in every way because he's stupid levels of OP BS) where if they were fighting to win as fast as possible rather than make a spectacle the Enterprise has teleported technology and the Star Destroyer has no way to block teleporters, as well as being from a universe where big space weapons tend to have one critical part that keeps their engines from exploding.","1443657801"

What I would advise to do is to be familiar with the cards' meanings. There's no need to memorize lots of detail on each card, but getting the main idea will help you build your own interpretations during readings. Also, one thing I found useful is that if you are using the tarot to answer a question, avoiding any questions that can be answered in one word (yes/no, who, what, when, where) will help you get a more detailed answer.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","Here's an answer I wrote to someone asking about Necrophos a few months ago.

____

**Long response**

At level 4, his aura deals 1.5% HP damage per second to anyone inside of the aura. By the late game most characters will have 2000+ health. So let's say you're against a team of 5 with 2000 HP each. In teamfights, just through your aura you will be dealing 150 damage per second just by staying alive. That's quite a lot of damage per second, so to utilise that you want to make yourself stay alive for as long as possible in fights and you do this by getting tanky items.

http://www.dotabuff.com/players/131170972/matches?date=&amp;faction=&amp;hero=necrophos&amp;lobby_type=&amp;game_mode=&amp;region=&amp;duration=

What I normally do is start by buying Tangos, Salve, Clarity, 3x Iron Wood Branches. You don't normally need a clarity because of your Sadist, but sometimes it can be handy if you're not getting reliable last hits.

I then get Boots of speed. Next I get a Robe of Magi to build into Power Treads. I normally prefer getting a Robe over the belt because it gives you a nice amount more damage for last hitting. I then finish the Power Treads and build a Mekansm or a Pipe of Insight depending on if the enemies are very spell focussed or not.

The next absolutely great item to get is the Rod of Atos. It gives you everything you want. More tankiness and more Intelligence so you don't run out of MP. Also, the slow on it has insane range and a really low cooldown. After this I get Platemail and build that into a Shiva's Guard. Gives so much armour it's great. If someone else has gotten a Shiva's Guard I'll get an Assault Curaiss if no-one else is going for it and we have a lot of right clickers. The amount of armour both give you makes you nice and tanky.

I used to get a Heart of Tarrasque at this point but I'm thinking about trying thee Eye of Skadi since, even though it gives you less HP and the regen, it gives you a nice amount of strength and intelligence and then enough agility to increase your armour again by 3 or 4 points. Also, the slow on your autoattack means you can slow people's rate of attack and thus make you yourself stay alive longer.

I don't normally get the Aghanim's Sceptre though since I feel that your money is normally spent better in making yourself tanky, but if they have one super hard carry that's being annoying like Void, then you could get it. If you get extra money you could replace your Rod with a Scythe of Vyse. A Heart of Tarrasque is also good if you feel you're still not tanky enough, but you'd need to be replacing your Power Treads with Boots of Travel first.

I will normally level up Aura, Pulse then Pulse first as level 1 pulse is pretty terrible and you're never really going to use it in most cases. After that, get sadist, max pulse, max sadist and then max aura while taking the ultimate at appropriate levels.

Also, don't play Necrophos as a support. Anyone who thinks that a character who has half of his abilities revolving around him getting kills is a support clearly doesn't know what they're talking about.

**Short response**

Tangos, Salve, Clarity, 3x Branches

Boots of Speed &gt; Power Treads &gt; Mekansm or Pipe of Insight. (Pipe if a lot of magic damage)

Rod of Atos &gt; Shiva's Guard &gt; Eye of Skadi/Heart.

Aghanim's if they have a very strong carry. Get enough money, replace Rod with Scythe of Vyse. Heart will make you almost unkillable at this point.

Abilities: 2 1 1 3 1 4 1 3 3 3 4 2 2 2 S 4

Although a bit has changed since I originally wrote this post a few months ago, it's still mostly fine. The only changes I'd make are that a Wand can be nice to grab, Heart is better if your enemies are mainly magic based, and Skadi if they're mainly physical damage, but only if you make use of the autoattack slow. Also, you can go for Guardian Greaves if you feel it'll be worth it.","1443657804"

"bjj","t5_2qn02","Lets put it this way.

If you're in mount, you have two big options.

a) continue keeping mount and raining down punches.

b) work for the armbar 


pros of a)

chance to finish fight with minimal risk of getting position reversed.

if round ends, you still wear down your opponent with damage and exhaustion.

you're always OPEN to option B when you feel like you've sufficiently softened up your opponent.

cons of a)

takes more energy to balance, and continually rain down strikes than it is to work for option b)

pros of b)

you finish the fight.

cons of b)

more likely to get reversed, or lose position.

Obviously there are some more nuances in here, but that is generally why I think in positions like the mount, it's sometimes just better to GnP until you win, than go for the submission.","1443657811"

Each stage drops an ether that restores 2, and mana spring recovers 2. So for a 4-stage boss rush I would have 22 shots for physical attackers and 24 shots for mages. Divide it by 4 means I can use 6 shots per person in each stage. The first stages are easy and the last is hard, so you want to focus your ability usage on the first stage. If you have less than that you want to do retaliate. 

Hint: Avoid anything less than 6 shots for boss rush. The only exception is protectga/shellga if you have concentrate II, but you may want to consider not bringing them completely. Avoid bringing too much non-damaging moves like intimidate. ","1443657814"

And it's not like they can scale infinitely; the number of instances active at any given time has an upper bound. Even games like ESO and GW2, built with your idea of a megaserver in mind, find themselves hitting that limit (Cyrodiil had awful lag for a long time).

Megaservers mostly refer to dynamically putting players into instances so resources can be spread across multiple servers instead of requiring users from the same server be inside the same instance. It doesn't mean they can spin up new hardware at a moment's notice, and it doesn't mean it's impossible to be at capacity. It just means players aren't forced into separate servers.

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","This was back in 3U but it was my most terrifying moment in monster hunter.

I was in the flooded forest, hunting a queropeco(?). Now, this wasn't my first time hunting that damn bird, I knew it had a rather novel ability of drawing in monsters with its singing; usually calling in a G. jaggi or that honey bear. What I wasn't prepared for was what it called to me. 

I giant, dark ravenous beast I would soon know well. Devil Joe. 

I initially screamed like a little girl and fled the area to gather my senses. I picked a crawl-through spot surrounded by towering rock pillars. ""Relax"", I thought. ""There is no mention of hunting a second monster.... I'll just have to avoid it and stop that son of a bitch from calling it.""

Then I heard the theme change. It was trumpeting and fearsome. Definitely didn't belong to big bird. I could hear it's lumbering footsteps coming to my makeshift camp. The rock pillars was the only thing in between us.

There was an eerie moment of silence. As if it knew I was behind it. I tensed up. ""There's no way it can get to me"", I thought, ""I'm safe here"". I was wrong. It began to throw its weight at the wall of rocks, which came crumbling down. I was in utter disbelieve that it could that.  

This was the first time I got a good look at it... A large jaw covered in spikes. Skin covered in scars. It was horrifying. I nearly pissed myself and ran away. 

Most of the hunt then consisted of avoiding the beast and doing my utmost to stop queropeco from summoning it. 

Truly an unforgettable moment lol.

"OrthodoxChristianity","t5_2qra3","&gt; For example, they consider the ""gender binary"" i.e us saying that there are two sexes and corresponding genders is a social construct.

It is not necessary to reject the social construction of gender differences - which is what you're doing - to get the result of not allowing transsexual males become priests. While we're probably not into the stronger forms of gender-as-social-construct (and neither are many third wave feminists), I have a very hard time seeing weaker forms as intrinsically problematic for an Orthodox Christian. There are certainly some types of third wave feminism that have troubles with Orthodox Christianity, I'd be surprised if all third wave feminism, even the ones that talk about 5 sexes and gender-as-social-construct, were somehow anathema.

"de","t5_22i0","Danke. Bei dem Zusammenschnitt wurden fast nur Probleme angesprochen, aber es wurden kaum Lösungen genannt (kam fast wie stumpfes Bashing rüber). Bei der ungeschnittenen Version sind auch interessante Lösungsansätze dabei, die mich auch in einigen Punkten umdenken lassen (vor allem bei der Fragerunde, wobei sie aber auch selbst mehrmals sagen, dass sie auch nicht ""die Lösungen"" des Problems parat haben). Allerdings finde ich manche Punkte auch fragwürdig. 

Zum Beispiel sagt Herr Schiffauer (15:30), dass der Ansatz der sicheren Herkunftsländer quasi unwirksam ist, weil trotzdem jeder Antrag einzeln geprüft werden muss. Außerdem sagt er später, dass eh nur 10-12% (23:30) der Anträge von Asylbewerbern aus sicheren Herkunftsländer gestellt werden. Andererseits schlägt er als Lösung vor, diesen Ansatz quasi umzukehren in ""klare/unsichere Herkunftsländer"". Dabei nennt er Syrien und Irak. Dadurch würde man 50% Arbeit beim Bamf einsparen, da ja 50% der Anträge von solchen Flüchtlingen kämen (das allein ist ja wohl zumindest etwas Milchmädchen-mäßig gerechnet).

Dazu stellen sich mir zwei Fragen:

- Müsste bei einer solchen Regelung nicht auch, genauso wie bei dem Ansatz der sicheren Herkunftsländer, eh jeder Antrag einzeln geprüft werden? Warum sollen dabei dann Einzelfallprüfungen verzichtbar sein? Wäre diese Regelung der unsicheren Herkunftsländer dann nicht genauso wenig wirksam, wie die der sicheren Herkunftsländer? (Und warum nicht beides?)
- Wo hat er diese Zahlen her? Laut [Bamf](http://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Downloads/Infothek/Statistik/Asyl/201508-statistik-anlage-asyl-geschaeftsbericht.pdf?__blob=publicationFile) sind bei weitem keine 50% der Anträge aus Syrien und Irak, die von ihm geforderten unsicheren Herkunftsländern, sondern nur ca. 27%. Auf der anderen Seite das Gegenteil: Laut Bamf sind nicht nur 10-12% der Anträge aus sicheren und jetzt geplanten sicheren Herkunftsländer, sondern ca. 40%.

Leider bleibt eine ähnliche Frage ab 48:16 eher unbeantwortet (generell sind die letzten drei Fragen ziemlich interessant).","1443657826"

The edge of the visible universe is therefore expanding at 3.241 c. If we move at that speed, we'll stay at a constant distance. If we go just a tiny bit faster, as we gain on it the remaining distance won't expand as fast and we'll approach the end exponentially. The difference in speed is about 6.388\*10^(-22) m/s.

Sheik's Fair was already safe on shield in many situations. It's safer now, sure, but this helps her less than other characters since a well spaced Fair was already safe.

What I'm trying to say is that EVERYBODY's safety on shield was helped. So if you focus on a character in a vacuum (like the best character in the game, Sheik) of course they will seem better (so it's easy to fearmonger the notion that the best character got even better). But compared to other characters, if Sheik got helped less than other characters, it's a nerf overall. It makes the other character closer to Sheik's level in terms of safety on shield.","1443657828"

the trail all the way to the valley is maintained gravel. so runners would be fine. as for temperature, there is a mountain close by called Tower of Babel (seen from the parking lot) and this has approx the same elevation as larch valley. so if you look at [this link](http://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Tower-of-Babel/forecasts/2221) you should get a pretty good idea of the temperatures in the valley. 

I would suggest a rain jacket or a warm jacket since the highs in the area will be between 4c-9c and lows of 1c. perhaps some rain on friday night.

Just like a refracting telescope with a slightly damaged or warped lens, or an eyepiece that's not in the correct focus position, your brain has to resolve a slightly diffuse, blurred image and that makes it harder to identify individual points of light.  Glasses or LASIK surgery are the most common ways to compensate for this, although if you're like me you won't like having your glasses on while trying to look through your eyepieces.

In ancient cultures, the Pleiades were used as a test for eyesight.  Those who could identify 6 or 7 stars were considered to have the most superior vision and were ideal candidates to become hunters.","1443657830"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Here's my two cents, for what it's worth.

Frankly, not sure how this can be changed, but I feel that, as a guitar player, /r/guitarlessons is 1000 times more useful than this sub. I think it's kind of silly that they're even different subs to be honest, and it really feels limiting for educational guitar material to be somewhere other than /r/guitar. Furthermore, the userbase gets split even further with /r/playingguitar. I think splitting our userbase this much is what leads to such a lack of discussion and worthy posts.

Honestly, my favorite part of the sub is checking out people's new gear. What does that say? Every other post is a ""let me google that for you"" (which, imo, could be helped by a more visible ""No Stupid Questions"" thread that wasnt hidden in the megathread. There's so little content here now that RoTW and NSQ should be getting their own threads. 

Another thing I'd like to see is more performances and for the users to encourage everyone to post their music for feedback. Now, no one wants 50 ""Wish You Were Here"" covers every week, but I think people acknowledging bedroom (and live) players at all levels could garner so much needed enthusiasm. 

And, although you guys do good work, I think mods need to be a little better and cleaning up basic questions and gear recommendations (which have the same answers every time). Maybe a gear recommendation or advice thread","1443657834"

Ah, no. I had an alcoholic, abusive ex like this. You're lying to yourself. When it's good, it's not great -- you're waiting for the next explosion, which you know is coming. 

Your children's lives are already a mess; you need to get them out. They are the priority here. You should get out before a social worker tells you you don't have a choice in the matter and removes the kids for you. 

Google 'dry drunk' -- an alcoholic who has temporarily gone off the bottle flying into rages is very common. 

(Or by 'dropped the *hard* alcohol' do you mean he just switched from whisky to beer or something like that? Totally irrelevant what his booze delivery method of choice is.)

There is zero chance that your kids will benefit from staying in this mess. Leaving will be a rescue, not 'turning their lives upside down.' 

&gt;  I do not want my two sons treating anyone this way or my daughter to think that when things are tough you just give up and leave. 

You want, I hope, your daughter to recognise that when somebody is treating her like crap, the correct thing to do is *leave.* 

Get out, get counselling for the kids, get therapy for yourself to unpack the reasons you ended up in this mess and stayed in this mess so you don't end up in another mess (or going back to him yet again). Find a good family law attorney.","1443657836"

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","Well over 90% of cases in the US are resolved via plea bargain.  It's not at all some rare thing you can only obtain if you have special info, it's overwhelmingly the ordinary way of resolving cases.   

There's all sorts of good reasons to avoid trying this case.  You never know how a jury is going to react to somebody like Jay, and you never know what a Judge is going to do at sentencing with a minor.   Not to mention that a confession is usually better for and easier on the victim's family.   

They really do give out plea bargains just navies :-)

I'll give you an example.

Remember when you were young, like 12-16 years old, and you would always go over to your friends house?

And like your friends mom was pretty decent looking, but his dad wasnt? Not that you were gay or anything, but lets be honest, you can tell whether or not a guy is good looking. 

Anyways your friends dad had that Budweiser belly, a prescription for pharmaceutical grade antacid, and always let off a smelly fart whenever he was by himself in the den watch tv. 

And you just think to yourself, man, how did he score her? Let alone fuck him and have kids with him, and marry him? Like who would ever want to be around that and deal with that all the time? *I don't know how anyone could be married to this*

Well now step back for a second and think about your friend. He loves his dad. His mom loves his dad. His dad's great. He always knows what to say when he's down, hes good at helping vent anger and frustration, and he's just an overall a good guy. 

Well to some people, music like Party Cannon is like that.

"Magic","t5_2qh74","There have been a lot of good ones listed so far here are a few more.

In basketball there's an inbound play where the team lines up the close free throw line and I forget how it goes but it leads to a player breaking to the basket by them self.

There's the wrong way play in basketball where you get the ball under your basket off the tip-off. You fake toward the other basket to get the other team to retreat than turn around and make a layup.

In tennis when there was a lob I would occasionally feign a smash to make the other team back up; then I'd hit a drop shot.
Another thing I would mix in was a fake poach which would lead to them hitting an easy shot right to me. I'm sure there are some more I've used.

In table tennis I'll condition an opponent by only serving to one side then hitting a trick serve to the other side. Or similar in play I'll consistently hit it to the far right side before hitting one to the far left.

In baseball runners will occasionally feign stealing with a head fake, trying to draw the catchers throw so they can run if he overthrows.

A hard snap count in football is an example if you repeatedly snap it on the loud 3 then do a loud 3 but don't snap it you may draw the defense offsides.

I'm sure other people will be able to add even more as it's actually pretty common in sports.","1443657837"

I know container combinations may ruin the looting/base raiding spirit of survival but I am sure there mechanics that can possibly offset some of this (such as disallowing safe storage containers in areas near popular looting areas and forcing players to travel a larger distance if they want to keep their loot safe).

"getdisciplined","t5_2uzju","Literally in the same situation (video editor too). Honest question: do you really like doing this or are you just doing it because it's a job/you're good at it? Back when I was doing basic editing, I treated it like a job and I never got anything done. Then I was given a project where I had to do some minor visual effects (and by minor I mean finding cool filters in Final Cut to make something look like a dream). When I started doing this I found some cool resources for how to learn to do better color correction and visual effects. Since then, I found my niche and spend most of my days perfecting my skills if I don't have a project. Once I started doing that I made practice films using those skills and basically use them to advertise for myself. I've gotten lots of projects based on people who have seen those videos and thought they looked cool.

But if you're really having a hard time doing freelance, try to find an advertising agency that doesn't have an editor on staff. A lot of them nowadays don't know they need an editor until you wow them (this happened to me last year). At least going to work every day in an office would force you to be a little bit more productive than you normally would. And often times that kind of work is part time so it would just supplement your income and keep you from getting rusty. At the very least, it will give you something to do that could possibly mean more income down the road to get a better place, more video games, movies, etc.

Hopefully you find something that works for you :-)","1443657839"

White is the better athlete and has the higher chance at the big play, while Hayne is the more consistent return man. If anything, I think Ellington is going to be the #1 KR, and once he comes back Ellington might take that spot.

As for Hayne, his strengths are perfect for punt, no reason to put him on starting KR. He has great SAQ, and knows how to work in space. Killer stiff arm and decent at breaking tackles.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt; It certainly is. Preordering, by virtue of supplying no guarantee to the consumer that they're actually going to get what they want, rewards fraudulent representations on the part of developers.

Completely incorrect.  What you find unethical is the fraudulent practices, which most pre-ordering systems account for (see Steam refunds).

&gt; ""There are no bad tactics, just bad targets"", eh?

If you can't present a sincere argument then I don't see much of a reason to continue.  On the off chance you are just stupid instead of actively participating in bad faith what I said is nothing like the tactic/target dichotomy.  

If I supported that stance then I would have argued about *who* does it instead of *how* they do it.  How --for the literately challenged-- denotes a change in the tactics.  You defined one broad brush and said that it unequivocally bad.  The truth is that when done properly, in a way the protects and/or rewards the consumer it is not a bad thing to do.

&gt; However, next time something like Mighty No 9 comes along and strings you along and you want to bitch about it? Just remember that you were warned that your actions have consequences.

And every time a company that rewards it's customers and does right by them while also employing the some of the tactics you mention it proves how your extremism is wrong.

  While there are failures like Mighty No 9 and Broken Age there are also successes like Pillars of Eternity, Shadowrun Returns, and the many other wonderful games that would never exist if the likes of you had your way.","1443657846"

For those of you that do not know Joshua Warren is an owner for MSW, he has repeated tried to spread rumors that events are cancelled in a childish attempt to hurt another event producers attendance. You can clearly see this unprofessional childish behavior on any of our Facebook event pages. He has even used faked profiles or have had friends posting these same lies. Until there is a official statement made here under the Blacksheep Name you can plan on our events. Sorry for the confusion that this individual regularly tries to cause for our customers.
As always, any event that gets cancelled for any reason all players will be refunded. Any players that register using a coupon code will get their code reinstated for use at a future game. Do not let rumors keep you from registering for events and coming out to have a good time.

Very sad to see how this mighty series has fallen. The Level editor of THPS is a HUGE reason why I am now a level/environment artist for Bungie. My created levels used to be SUPER popular back then.

&gt;No mention of prisoners being gassed was never mentioned by Hitler

Except him calling out for the mass extermination of Poles and Jews and Gypsies - he didn't come up with how to kill them, he just hired people to kill them; it wasn't his problem how they should be killed.

&gt;nothing revealed by the code breakers and their Enigma machine

Information about killing people in these camps was never shared because it wasn't vital information for the front lines and war formations. That is the information that was intercepted by enigma - troops formations, supply routes, etc.

sans: the queen returned, and is now ruling over the underground.  
sans: she's enstated a new policy...  
sans: all the humans who fall here will be treated not as enemies...  
sans: but as friends.  
sans: it's probably for the best, anyway.  
sans: the human souls the king gathered...  
sans: seem to have disappeared.  
sans: so, uh, that plan ain't happening any time soon.  
sans: but even though people are heartbroken over the king...  
sans: ... and things are looking grim for our freedom...  
sans: the queen's trying her best not to let us give up hope.  
sans: so, uh, hey...  
sans: if we're not giving up down here...  
sans: don't give up wherever you are, ok?  
sans: who knows how long it will take...

The other ending was making friends with Papyrus and Undyne, but not Alphys (since that obviously unlocks the True ending).

The dialogue for the first part ('heya' up to 'I RECOGNISE THIS NUMBER!!!') is the same, so I'm copy-pasting the rest only.

PAPYRUS: ATTENTION, HUMAN!!!  
PAPYRUS: I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS...  
PAPYRUS: AM NOW CAPTAIN OF THE ROYAL GUARD!  
PAPYRUS: IT'S EVERYTHING I EVER DREAMED OF...  
PAPYRUS: EXCEPT, INSTEAD OF FIGHTING, WE JUST WATER FLOWERS.  
PAPYRUS: SO THAT'S EVER- SO- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.  
PAPYRUS: AND, WE'RE HELPING DR. ALPHYS WITH HER RESEARCH!  
PAPYRUS: SHE'S GONNA FIND A WAY TO GET US OUT OF HERE.  
PAPYRUS: UNDYNE IS HELPING HER TOO!  
PAPYRUS: THOUGH, TO BE HONEST, HER METHOD OF HELPING...  
PAPYRUS: SEEMS KIND OF...  
PAPYRUS: EXPLOSION- INDUCING.  
PAPYRUS: BUT I THINK ALPHYS LIKES HAVING HER AROUND.  
PAPYRUS: UH OH!!!  
Undyne: Hey!  
Undyne: What are you up to, punk!?  
Undyne: Ngahhhh!  
PAPYRUS: PLEASE DON'T NOOGIE THE PHONE.  
Undyne: Hey!  
Undyne: Who's in charge here!?  
PAPYRUS: ME.  
Undyne: Oh... yeah, that's right!  
Undyne: I quit my job as leader of the Royal Guard.  
Undyne: Actually, since we won't be fighting anymore...  
Undyne: The Royal Guard totally disbanded.  
Undyne: There's, uh, only one member now.  
PAPYRUS: BUT HE'S EXTREMELY GOOD.  
Undyne: Yeah!! He is!!!  
Undyne: C'mere!!  
PAPYRUS: PLEASE DON'T NOOGIE THE SKELETON.  
Undyne: Anyways, now I'm working as Alphy's lab assistant...  
Undyne: We're gonna find a way out of this dump once and for all!

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Two (maybe three) reasons actually:

First, getting a piece of plate large enough for this part is cost prohibitive. No one makes it, so it would have to be a special order.

Second, making a circle out of plate will leave a seam. Seams in a pressure vessel are bad because they're weak points. The reason this reactor vessel is made this large to begin with is to minimize the amount of welds necessary to seal it. Having a massive seam running along the length of one side would be extremely dangerous. --Fun fact! The US navy learned in the 1940s that long, continuous welds are prone to massive, catastrophic failure. [Look at the Liberty Ships](http://www.brighthubengineering.com/marine-history/88389-history-of-the-liberty-ships/?PageSpeed=noscript).

Third, open-die forging produces a much more uniform grain flow in the steel (steel has a grain direction much like wood). Rolled plate is highly anisotropic. It's strongest in the direction parallel to the grain flow, with as much as a 10% reduction in strength in the perpendicular direction and as much as 30%! in the thru-thickness direction (i.e. the faces of the plate being squished between the rollers). Toughness also takes a massive hit in these non-preferential directions.","1443657850"

The ""robes"" of KOTOR actually take the form of a long, almost-military tunic with a distinctive asymmetric fold pattern over the chest and large shoulder pads. Prequel-era robes, on the other hand, appear to consist of actual, multi-layered robes, which are folded symmetrically and joined by the belt, as well as a hooded cloak which is nowhere to be seen in KOTOR.

The robes in KOTOR II looked a lot more like the movies, but that's Obsidian's fault, not Bioware's.","1443657850"

The reality is the American government was designed to favour obstructionism. The President is the single most powerful person, but outside of foreign policy their ability to act is very limited. Yet people chose what feels good over what is true, so they chose to believe they can change the country by electing the right president.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Another idea for working chromatic notes into your playing is by using parallel modes. I'm not sure how familiar you are with modes as a concept, but if you aren't sure what I'm talking about then check out the relevant parts of the r/musictheory FAQ or Dave Conservatoire videos.

Anyway, parallel modes basically refer to the different modes rooted in the same tonal center. For example: C Ionian (major), C Dorian, C Phrygian, C Lydian, C Mixolydian, C Aeolian (natural minor), and C Locrian are all of the diatonic modes rooted in C. Pretty straightforward, right? But if you put them in a specific order you actually start to notice some cool patterns:

C Locrian,
C Phrygian,
C Aeolian,
C Dorian,
C Mixolydian,
C Ionian,
C Lydian

What I did there was line up the parallel modes in C according to the circle of fifths. Part of what makes that cool is that this means *to get from one parallel mode to any adjacent mode, you only need to change one note by one half step (or one fret).* The scale degreee you need to change varies depending on which modes you're moving between, but other than that one note, all of the other notes will remain exactly the same. 

What's even cooler about this is if we were to continue moving through the circle of fifths in this way:

C Locrian,
C Phrygian,
C Aeolian,
C Dorian,
C Mixolydian,
C Ionian,
C Lydian,
C# Locrian,
C# Phrygian,
C# Aeolian,
C# Dorian,
C# Mixolydian,
C# Ionian,
C# Lydian,
D Locrian,
D Phrygian,
D Aeolian,
etc...

Notice the pattern? You can keep following that same Locrian-Phrygian-Aeolian-Dorian-Mixolydian-Ionian-Lydian sequence, moving only one note by one half step each time, and end up traveling through all of the parallel modes in all 12 keys.

What does all of this mean musically? Well, I can't say for sure since I haven't gotten to experiment much with this concept yet. But one possibility is that using a method like this will allow you to gradually add in chromatic notes and subtly shift the harmony around while still thinking within a diatonic structure, and if you do it right the listener will barely be able to notice most of the changes. From my experience I would say that some changes are definitely more noticeable than others--moving between the Lydian in one key and then shifting the root to get to the Locrian of the next key, and any time you shift between diminished (Locrian), minor (Phrygian, Aeolian, Dorian) or major modes (Mixolydian, Ionian, Lydian). But anything else is fair play. What you could do to get around that is switch to the relative mode in whatever key you want, and then keep shifting between parallel modes from there if you want.

To experiment with this, I whipped together a quick test track a while back, running up and down through adjacent parallel modes with the relevant tonic chord vamping in the background, just to hear what it sounds like to move through the modes like that. It starts on B Locrian and then move through the adjacent parallel modes in sequence until it gets to D Lydian. Some of the note changes will be easier to notice, but you'll have to listen really closely for some of the others: https://soundcloud.com/patrick-tow/modes-test-1

Also, if any of what I've discussed here about modes is interesting to you, I put together a fancy, color-coded Excel spreadsheet a while back outlining all of the diatonic parallel modes in each key, with lots of other details added in like harmonizations and relative major/minor scales. I wouldn't mind sending you the file if you''re interested, just inbox me.

Because they are the ones who founded the idea of a society, and reaped the benifits of having one (bigger tribe = more security, resources, efficiency). Reap what you sow.
There is nothing stopping other countries doing so, but for some reason EU seems to have the best logical and structured societies. Ill let you think of your own reason why, because If I say it people will get mad at me for not being PC. 
Id just like to add, the EU did not get to the position it is in now (well, was (in terms of a functioning society and technological advances)) on the basis of political correctness and fairness. It was a 'get shit done' mentality. In the 1800's Do you think they give a shit about hiring an 'equal' workforce(sex, race, ethnicity, favourite food) when they build the next train bridge across a river, no of course not, they just hired whoever would get the job done the best.

&gt;And to end with an even more controversial bomb, if white males really are in positons of power due to past achivments, is it right for the rest of the society to take it away from them. 

No, its not right, but thats not because they are white, its because they are the very people who founded/organise/run societies. Dont replace the butcher with a baker just because the baker is feeling left out.

This is easy to say but difficult to accept at times.  When times are good we do not want them to change.  When times are bad they cannot change fast enough to suit us.

The Buddha taught the origin of stress and a path towards its cessation.  The origin of fear is clinging to things that cannot last.  The origin of clinging is craving fueled by ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. 

Everyone wants a certain amount of security in their lives.  We've not gone into homelessness, *Here a monk is satisfied with a robe to protect his body, with alms to satisfy his stomach, and having accepted sufficient, he goes on his way.  Just as a bird with wings flies hither and thither, burdened by nothing but its wings, so he is satisfied.*  ~DN 2.66.  But, this doesn't mean we cannot expose the origin of our fears and insecurities  and see them for what they really are.    We don't always get to do what we want to do when we want to do it but we can always find happiness here and now when we let go of certain ideas about ""how things should be.""

"BitcoinMarkets","t5_2wwh3","Since there were plenty of posts to you regarding whether or not it is possible to day trade bitcoin, I will focus on your implied  question of whether it is worth it.

Yes. It is worth it. I suggest:

(1) Taking 10% and putting that amount into cold storage (basically putting it away for a while and not day-trading it).
(2) 40% and daytrading it as often as you reasonably can...look at bitcoin history, mapped out in 15-minute increments, on a daily basis. See why so many people like daytrading it...? If you have the time and are a good guesser then you may be able to profit more than 1% daily. I like to assume large moves can come at any time so I move in and out dozens of times per day to hedge against large downward moves (which seem common the last year).
(3) The other 50% to be used for medium-term strategies. Maybe basing these trades off of sentiment in this forum, impending news and rumors, and your overall feeling about bitcoin and where you feel it is headed on a weekly to monthly basis (maybe by doing as much homework as you have the time for regarding companies who are currently working with or considering working with bitcoin...not just blockchain). And, of course watching the global financial markets to see how events there could affect the price of bitcoin in various currencies. 

This, plus my code for daytrading (my 40%) is how I do it. We are getting close to  300 days into the year...so according to my post, I should be up hundreds of percents. I am not. I am only currently up about 10%. My code runs 24/7 and I spend way too much time on my medium term trades. I have been daytrading bitcoin for about 3 years now.

I haven't read all the responses here. But I am pretty sure someone here told you where to set up in an exchange. Remember that you have fees with each trade as well...so you have to outpace the fees on quick/small daytrades. But I am sure you already accounted for that.

I hope you do end up giving it a try.","1443657852"
"europe","t5_2qh4j","It really depends on where they come from. Asians seem to integrate the best. They're scary motivated and smart. Then on the other hand you have Africans. They came here 100s of years ago and still have failed to integrate. With latino immigrants it's a mix, some are very hard working but many struggle and many end up in gangs.

Being American is kind of meaningless though. So it's not surprising no one takes offense to someone claiming that identity. What's it mean to be american? You eat fast food? Like football in which you don't use your feet? Our culture is mostly vapid soulless commercialism. Try to claim to be an actual american native if you're less than like 50% native american and see how quickly people get uppity.","1443657852"

This should bother you:

The 2009 U.S. military budget accounts for approximately 40% of global arms spending. The 2012 budget is 6–7 times larger than the $106 billion military budget of China The United States and its close allies are responsible for two-thirds to three-quarters of the world's military spending (of which, in turn, the U.S. is responsible for the majority).[33][34][35] The US also maintains the largest number of military bases on foreign soil across the world.[36]

In 2005, the United States spent 4.06% of its GDP on its military (considering only basic Department of Defense budget spending), more than France's 2.6% and less than Saudi Arabia's 10%.[37]information 2006 This is historically low for the United States since it peaked in 1944 at 37.8% of GDP (it reached the lowest point of 3.0% in 1999–2001). Even during the peak of the Vietnam War the percentage reached a high of 9.4% in 1968.[38]

That said I think he regressed since then on other team, his throws where no on target anymore and he started to miss people rather than people missing the ball right in front of him.

I didn't buy my fucking quad to act tough, or thrash an eco-system or to prove how much money I make. Dirt biking and quadding are tons of fun, I didn't buy my truck as a status symbol and I don't drive it like a retard. Contrary to your closeminded view of the rest of the world not everyone is out to destroy it. There are 4x4 Parks all over and they'd be there regardless if whether or not I bought mine. I'm well aware people make more money than I do, and generally I am pretty relaxed about it, but apparently working hard and spending money on the things I enjoy isn't allowed according to you, or... it's allowed but apparently it makes me a douchey cunt?

I also don't smoke, or throw litter out my window. If your beef is with idiots, that's fine, but don't generalize and throw me in with that group just because I happen to have a big truck. That's not only ignorant but it's also extremely telling of the type of person you are.","1443657857"

It's AWESOME in both colourways and 15 years later each of them still fits firmly - and perfectly despite subtle changes in size and shape. At times, I've worn the Phoebe 3x a week. I've tried to find another and I've had no luck. It's only available as dead stock in very few sizes (as far as I can tell). Treat it well and you will have it for many years!

PS: Freya used to be a much better brand than it is now - and more expensive. It didn't cater to the youth market as it does now. The bands were all true to size. Now, the only one with a true to size band is the Rio. BTW - that band is just as tight as it's ever been because they haven't changed that continuity style.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I've found that the best relationship is one where you are friends as well as partners. You can spend time together and enjoy each other's company and be happy romancing the hell out of the situation, or just hanging out talking and doing something totally non romantic. It just makes things better when you've got something to work with that doesn't always have to be relationshipy.

Heck, leading independent lives means that you appreciate each other when you're together. The basic premise is we've all got our own things in our life and we don't have to be the sum total epicentre of each other's life. Sure a major part, but having your time with your own friends or an interest that is your own ( watching or participating in sports, hobbies) even just messing around at home doing boring domestic crap can be a one player or multiplayer activity.  
The point is that a relationship can have a lot in it if there is a solid foundation, and to me my relationship with my wife has our friendship as a solid foundation.","1443657860"

&gt;Fortunately for society, most people don't think this in this greedy, sociopathic, selfish way. They are actually grateful for the opportunity this nation had given them, and are more than willing to help those less fortunate than themselves.


Good, then they'll voluntarily increase the wage without greedy thugs, such as yourself, having to break down peoples' doors and demand they hand over their money.

I find it's absolutely hilarious to watch greedy, self-righteous sociopaths such as yourself get on your bandwagon about a lack of empathy. The fact of the matter is that whenever anyone mentions businesses that can be forced to close due to a minimum wage, your kind's response is always ""IF THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES WHAT I ARBITRARILY DECLARE TO BE A LIVING WAGE, THEY DESERVE IT!"" When people struggle to find work because idiots have lead us to a point where even your standard burger flipper is too much of an investment to hire on without some experience beforehand to make sure they can due that pathetically easy job, your kind is always the first to either ignore them or say it's their own fault.

You are a greedy, self-righteous little sociopath. You feel some anger over whatever pet cause you've adopted this week and then say that threatening *to fucking murder people* is justified because in your mind you're doing the right thing, all the unfortunate victims caused by your ""doing the right thing"" can rot in hell for all you care.

You like to lecture *me* about selfishness? Mother fucker I *work*. I spent two fucking years unemployed because idiots like you started hollering that employees need more more more. More unions, more benefits, higher minimum wage, and the result of your fucking shortsighted remedies to feel like you're a good person is you can't even break into the labor force as a fucking *barista* without six months worth of customer service experience beforehand.

Jackasses like *you* are leading people off a cliff and self-righteously screaming that whoever doesn't follow you off the ledge is an evil person. You howl that you should have a right to take away someone else's stuff because *YOU* decided they don't deserve it.

Don't even try to lecture me about morality. Yours is a morality that's contradictory and selfish in nature. You use violence to enforce your beliefs and then have the smugness to come onto boards, such as this, and start insulting everyone who doesn't cow-tow to your poorly thought out, self-centered moral system.

You're a smug, petty, narcissistic little child. There's been a million people like you in history and by the time you and I have long since passed there'll be a million more.","1443657860"

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","~~Maybe there is a limit and they just didn't mention it? But really I had this discussion with some of my org and I think that in-combat hospitals are going to be near worthless. This is not to say the Endeavor itself is useless or that even hospitals are, just that during combat they are.~~

~~My reasoning is that if someone dies during a battle and respawns on an Endeavor it means that either their ship has blown up or they have died while boarding. In either case you have now revived a person who has no ship and no way to re-enter combat. What's he going to do now that he respawned, stare out the windows? EVAing to ships while they're moving or during a space battle is going to be pure suicide, but maybe you'll make it? If a lot of boarding is occurring you could maybe send a dropship to pick up the newly revived people to drop them somewhere else. But mostly people who revive are just going to be sitting there. All of this is at the cost of more soldiers in a battle. You could have had the 12 or whatever people it takes running the Endeavor each have a one seater fighter, or an Idris! Reviving your people may save them some money if they die during it, but ultimately it will cost you more if you end up losing the battle because you put resources into reviving people.~~

"anime","t5_2qh22","It's been awhile since I've watched but I've been recently reminded of the series.  

As far as I know, Gouda is ultra-nationalistic, though he enjoys manipulating and... 'serving' Japan from the shadows.  In regards to the refugees, he would prefer that they don't exist as he believes they are a burden to Japan, a Japan that can't say 'No.'  (Shades of the crazy real-life ex-Tokyo govenor Ishihara here.)

When he and other ultra-nationalists like the Individual Eleven want independence for the refugees it is merely to try and cut them away from Japan.  ""Let them deal with their own mess,"" is more their philosophy.  In thinking so, they declare that the refugees should do things by themselves and be independent of Japan, all the while knowing that the refugees aren't capable of being independent.  (For example where will they get food?  There's no arable land there.)

And in the Individual Eleven's case, sabotaging the refugee's hopes and chances are also on the order, to burn the candle of Refugee failure on both ends, so to speak.

In this story, and as with a lot of ultra-nationalist strategies in the world today and in history, their tactic is to prove that some group of people are inferior, weak, immoral, etc., in order to justify harsh action against them, anywhere from ostracization up to genocide.","1443657861"

First, verify the integrity of the game cache. Right click on the game in steam, choose properties -&gt; local files -&gt; Verify integrity. Should take a bit. Once that finishes, try running it again.

If that doesn't work, right click on the game again, choose properties -&gt; local files -&gt; browse game files, right click on the executable file named RivalsOfAether, and choose ""Run as Administrator"".

If *that* doesn't work, right click on the executable file, choose properties -&gt; Compatibility, check the box for ""Run this program in compatibility mode for: and choose something like Windows 8 or windows 7. Alternatively, right click on the executable and choose ""Troubleshoot compatibility"". 

Beyond that, make sure graphics drivers are updated (though that shouldn't be the issue based on what you described), or try uninstalling then reinstalling the game. That's pretty much an exhaustive list of what I've done to fix similar problems in the past.","1443657862"

2 cups milk 
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
6 eggs
6 pieces of toast
butter
pepper
salt

Make a roux with the butter and flour.

Add the milk to the roux and stir bring up to heat until thickened.  Do not boil.

Add the eggs to a pot and cover with water.  Cover the pot and bring to a boil and then take off the heat.  Set timer for 10 minutes.

When the timer goes off rescue the eggs.  I like to put them into a ice bath for a minute.

Peel eggs and roughly break up the whites while putting the yolks into a sieve.

Put the broken up whites into the white sauce you made earlier.  

Push the yolks through the sieve into a bowl.

Put the toast on a plate.  Dress with butter, then add the sauce egg mixture.  Next top with the yolk powder type stuff.  I like to add a little salt and pepper to taste at this point.

The 5X is actually substantially *larger* than the 5 - 5.2"" as opposed to 4.96"".  There are precious few options for a decent 5"" phone these days - the 5X had a good chance to be one, but it screwed the pooch and started edging ever-closer to the 6"" ""phablet"" dimensions.

There's literally only a 0.5"" difference between the 5X and 6P screen sizes (5.2"" vs 5.7""), if you can believe that (versus a 1.1"" difference between the 5 and the 6).

Totally agree on everything else - the 5X is overpriced for its specs, lacklustre for a 2015 phone and missing features even the Nexus 5 had.

I also briefly debated the 6/6P, but it also lacks wireless charging (annoying), and I just can't see how anyone uses a 5.7-6"" phone one-handed.  It's like a fucking tea-tray!","1443657870"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","It's a PC game and it has a fairly obscure learning curve and objectively one of the worst environments for new players because often times older players make new accounts and get matched up with all these first time players and it's not uncommon for them to be extremely rude, (This is just in my experience of the game when I played a long time ago, it could be quite different now but I have doubts) also it has a really harsh in-game currency that makes it to where it can take about a week of continuous daily play-time to get enough currency to unlock one character. Lastly, the game itself has a lot of balance issues where seemingly every update something is either changed to be incredibly weak or incredibly strong, which can make for extremely un-fun gameplay. However all I did with this post was highlight all of the negative aspects, I'm sure someone in this thread plays league of legends avidly and will provide positive aspects of the game, I just personally dislike it and thought I would tell you why. There's a plethora of footage of the game on youtube and other websites, including introductory videos explaining the gameplay and other mechanics, if you're still intrigued I would suggest you check out some footage.

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","&gt;A partir do momento em que você vai dialogar com um trabalhador com notas, artigos, panfletos ou seja lá o que for escritos como ""carxs trabalhadorxs"" (e seguindo com esta forma de escrita), você torna o diálogo menos prático e menos didático, causando desinteresse ou confusão em grande parte do público alvo que, em lugares onde o proletariado ainda é mais atrasada ou não tão desenvolvido, muitas vezes é composto por analfabetos funcionais.

Analfabeto funcional não é sinônimo de estúpido. Isso é uma coisa que precisa de apenas um esclarecimento para a pessoa entender. 

&gt; Significa ""caros trabalhadores e caras trabalhadoras.""

Ainda pode tornar o texto menor e menos penoso. Se vc está escrevendo um texto para pessoas que não conseguiriam entender isso, eu acho que esse é seu menor problema, pois o resto do texto provavelmente vai ser ininteligível. É melhor trocar o meio e fazer um discurso.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That I was anorexic.

Background info, I'm 17 years old and I weigh only 115 pounds. At the time my parents thought I was anorexic I was probably 14 and weighed 100 pounds. Every single time we would eat dinner I would have to go to the bathroom halfway through the meal without fail. After several days of this happening they became suspicious that I was going to the bathroom to force vomit the food I just ate. Secondly, I always liked to cover myself up in as much clothes as possible. Tennis shoes, sweatpants, and a hoodie was my ideal outfit. Why? I don't know. But they took it that I didn't want people to see my body structure, I don't know. And finally they started demanding proof of what I ate for lunch everyday at school. It was ridiculous. It took long enough for me to pick up on the fact that they thought I was anorexic and finally sat them down and told them I'm not. 

TL;DR: Parents thought I was anorexic because I'm really skinny, always went to the bathroom mid meal, wore baggy clothes and they didn't know what I did for lunch at school.","1443657873"

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","Personally I avoid films of rapists and pedophiles like Woody Allen, Polanski, and Bryan Singer, but mainly because I don't want to contribute a cent to supporting their evil lifestyle.  All three would be in prison of it weren't for their wealth, fame, and connections, and I believe everyone has a responsibility to keep evil people like that off the street, and giving them money is the direct opposite.  However, as long as you pirate their movies to ensure they won't get any money from it, the decision becomes more about the film's morality.  I completely avoid Woody Allen films, for example, because they're all supposedly about love or something and Woody Allen clearly hasn't the faintest idea of what love is.  Someone who so callously destroys the lives of both his children and his wife in favor of thinking with his dick has absolutely nothing worthwhile to say about it.  But if the film's morality isn't such a focus--perhaps the film itself is about fucked up topics, murder, violence, making the audience intentionally uncomfortable.  In that case a glimpse into an evil mind could be very interesting.  


Also one has to consider the proliferation of child abuse and rape in the Hollywood industry.  For every Polanski, Allen, or Singer whose crimes are public knowledge, there's someone getting away with the exact same sort of thing who you've never heard of.  It's really only the most egregious cases that reach the public eye; Polanski drugged and sodomized a 13-year-old and bragged about it, Allen molested his daughter and fucked his step-daughter, and Singer is notorious for his ""pool parties"" with underage boys and his casting couch and his place in Hawaii where he flies out naive young X-Men fans to rape them.  Someone who is a competent criminal and not just relying on the industry to shelter them probably wouldn't even let a hint of it get to the press.  So it's entirely possible that just about any movie could have a rapist involved in some way without the public knowing.","1443657873"

I'm not sure on that stats about scientists advocating white priv ledge but that's clearly a social matter and is typically shitter. And to be fair it does exist to a certain extent, there are studies that show this fairly unquestionably. What to do about it is a different case. And what exactly it encompasses is debatably with some not even science classes (are you confused about science vs academic?) being completely ridiculous in their typical advocation.

Gender being a scale is psychology and is an iffy but has some supporting evidence, the main issue in these topics is largely terminology being deployed in a way not similar to what the public uses it as. 

Gender dysphohria does have a fair amount of neuroscience type evidence behind it. So yeah, people can be the wrong gender based on having the brain structure of the wrong gender.

As for mounting APG-81 radars on the B-52; that'd be fairly expensive, but more than anything, it wouldn't make the B-52 invulnerable; it'd just buy it time while escort fighters engage the enemy. Also, the APG-81 only works in the X band; good for jamming the radars on pretty much all fighter aircraft, but limited in it's effectiveness against SAMs and airborne early warning aircraft.","1443657875"

"nrl","t5_2qn90","I posted about this guy in 'the what are you listening to?' question in the thread but thought I'd just do a little post about him anyway, cause I know there are few FIDLAR, Wavves, Smith Street Band, Violent Soho fans here, and this guy falls in that Surf Punk genre in one of his bands he performs in.

My mate Ethan moved to Tassie years ago and was one of the earlier pioneers of Folk Punk/Crust Folk in Aus and got a lot of praise, there are even a few subs Reddit for those Genres and they just keep reposting him and another band from Tassie. 

He had heaps of bands, Commonfilth!, Not Angry &amp; The Disappointments, Existential Terrorist, and Phat Meegz. 

Anyway, give this a listen:

http://phatmeegz.com/album/m-s-g-to-rudy and listen to Tuzz Life &amp; Hanging Out. 

Tuzz Life is about where we all grew up (Ethan, Myself and the 'Tuzz Life' crew) and it's just funny cause we were so self aware that we were from the North Shore of Sydney and nothing but middle middle class and above, so he made a song about it as if we little skate rats were somehow thugs haha. 

Hanging Out will remind people a lot of Violent Soho and such, he is musically so talented, just a shame he doesn't wanna be anything more than well known in his circles.

EDIT: Listen to HANGIN OUT first cause it's fucking so good. ","1443657877"

"yuri","t5_2qqk8","I love yuri and see that you are looking for some recommendations. So I will pick some more obscure entries from my list of favorites. 

Anime:
Everyone has mentioned my favorite yuri anime shows already. Unfortunately, yuri anime is still catching on. So some shows will just have to be ""subtext"" where relationships are hinted at. 
0) [Kanamemo] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/5914/Kanamemo) oh for the love of god Kanamemo. A cute slice of life show with great characters. Very funny and a solid recommendation.  

1) [Sakura Trick](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20047/Sakura_Trick) for when you get tired of shows teasing at yuri. This show is straight up yuri in your face. However, it stands out as more than that to me. It is a story about two girls exploring what love means to them, and it is unexpectedly funny as hell at moments. 

2) [Kuttsukiboshi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9014/Kuttsukiboshi) (NSFW) is kind of out there and only 2 episodes. It will make you think and it is pretty serious with lots of intense feelings and the repercussions that come from them. 

Manga:
1)[Poor Poor Lips](http://myanimelist.net/manga/11865/Poor_Poor_Lips) is literally my favorite thing in existence. This manga is greater than the sum of its parts. By all means it shouldn't be that good. However, it just made me fall absolutely in love with the characters. 

2)[Murcielago](http://myanimelist.net/manga/65705/Murci%C3%A9lago) [Gore, NSFW] is certainly a different experience to read. Does a government sponsored psychopath lesbian assassin sound like a good MC to you? Because it should. I haven't caught up to the current chapters yet, but what I read so far has got my attention.

If you spend them fast enough, you can lag the display so that it looks like they weren't spent, but the server still keeps a correct count. Your display will be updated to reflect the real total if/when you close entirely out of the game and reopen it.

You can demonstrate this pretty easily by spamming open bronze chests. It's possible to hit the button fast enough to open two sets of chests simultaneously. If you do this a few times, then record your gold total, log out, and log back in, you will see your display has been adjusted by the server to reflect a lower, correct amount. This correction often goes unnoticed in the ebb and flow of gems throughout the day, and a number of people have been disappointed to discover they weren't getting away with anything.

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","I think this sounds alright, but as you are encouraging players to brawl over a point and not through a different series of dynamic engagements (with changing surroundings and contexts), this gametype could become a little stale.

This could possibly be a little exhausting as a player. There is nothing imo wrong with lots of action but if gameplay itself doesnt feature its own contrast in circumstances (think 'highs' and 'lows' of action) it could become a little bit hard for the player to appreciate and enjoy those intense, all-in moments for what they are.

But if constant intensity is what you want, i think KOTH would be perfect.

Even going by statistics alone, 33% of rape victims **thinking** of suicide is lower than 100% of dead people being dead. Also, the comparison was against people who never suffered any crime. What kind of comparison is that?

Further to the end of the article, the most distressing effects of rape are actually post-crime, when society actually does the worst damage to the victims. Heck even getting pregnant, which all the leftists claim as the poster-child for abortion, rates a lousy 34% of preoccupation. Social factors double that.

PTSD, suicidal tendencies, trauma and emotional distress **all** have a cure. No matter how long it takes, it can be cured. You know what can't? Death.

Death is the pinnacle of evil against someone, the worst fate is death. You may believe in life after death, in some final respite for your soul. But going by what we know, death is just the evilest thing to do to someone. Erasing them.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","&gt; Your comment was directly aimed at me, mine was not aimed at any body at all.

A comment doesn't have to be aimed at anyone to be hurtful. I don't think that applies to only you. It was just directed at you because you said it. I think anyone with a similar attitude needs to get over themselves as well.

&gt; Maybe I'm overassuming peoples' levels of intelligence.

You're overcoming societies abilities to function without people working those jobs. Unless you enjoy dealing with a machine whenever you try to call customer service to get an answer. Menial jobs are necessary no matter what you think. And as I said above, not wanting to do a job is different than being above a job. And I don't see how those jobs do anything to your dignity in the first place. People can make great money as a server. They can make better money then entry level position in many fields.

&gt;  Tell me where I said something that puts them down and I will show you that that is just you implying it.

You said jobs are beneath your dignity which is putting down everyone who does those jobs especially if they have no other choice. And often it has nothing to do with intelligence. Society needs those jobs to function. And there are plenty of people who would love those jobs because they currently can't find any job. Yet here you are, taking a job that's beneath your dignity instead of letting someone else who wants that job have it.

&gt; So you claim I put down others, and then believe that I shouldn't make claims, because you order me, ""Then don't make claims..."". That is hypocrisy.

I said don't make claims you can't prove. I made a claim and supported it. You randomly said robots can do all menial jobs and then everyone can do what they want. That's a huge claim with a lot of scientific and economic assumptions and you didn't provide a single reason why anyone should think that's even remotely possible right now.

Doing what you have to to support yourself is never beneath someone. Imo that's way more respectable than someone pursuing what they want because they were handed that freedom.","1443657882"

The only thing that's spinning in circles are the blobs of jelly inside the heads of relativists.  There's plenty of (infinite and unbounded) space in there.

I may cherry-pick scientific journals, but at least I actually refer to them to back up my claims.  Your best argument is throwing around words like ""arrogant"" and ""egotistical.""  If that's what reality is, then I'd rather accept arrogance and egotism before premeditated self-delusion.

"AmIFreeToGo","t5_2ve29","On 31 May 2013 without Probable Cause or a Warrant, Agent B. Blanchard broke into Robert Trudell's sealed driver's door window. A plain clothed Agent along with Agent A. Magana searched the Trunk which Agent Blanchard pushed to close while asking if they had a Warrant. Agent Magana confirmed no Warrant or Probable Cause existed saying they were conducting a Weapons Search. Police Officer D. Miesen photographed an ""ein Berliner 9"" documentary movie prop badge from the trunk to submit to the Terrorism Liaison Unit. Agent A. Corpuz searched the passenger compartment and glovebox where U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection removed a powered down GM Business Phone assigned to Robert Trudell. Asset Forfeiture Office Paralegal, Jim Elam, refused requests to return General Motor's property which interfered with business communications. Agent B. Blanchard failed to clearly provide Orders to Robert Trudell and his subordinates resulting in an Illegal Search &amp; Seizure by him and those in his command.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection along with the Terrorism Liaison Unit conspired to Willfully violate my Copyrights to further the Identity of contracted partners including the Astroturfing CBP Agent Michael Flanders, CopBlock.org's Pete Eyre and CheckpointUSA.org's Terry Bressi. Their efforts create a false front encouraging criminal behavior and trapping those they lure into their net, manufacturing characters the public loathes and spreading widespread fear and myths to manipulate public behavior. Agent Flanders and Terry Bressi both directed me to an Intern Lawyer, Mitra Ebadolahi with the ACLU while I remained under CBP arrest. Mitra Ebadolahi passed fake Whistleblowing Agent information onto me furthering Flanders' false identity.

Seizure of my Property without a Warrant or Probable Cause left me fearful Agents would Seize my Property again while retrieving the originally Seized Equipment.

Yeah, cos we should just give jobs to women because they have an opinion when these guys who play start their TV and Radio training usually during their careers and some of then start vying for these types of positions up to a decade or more before. Look at Shane Crawford for example everyone knows once Sam Newman retires Shane will likely get that job because of his similar antics and the amount of work he's done on that show plus his AFL career and all of his other media performances, but noooo we should give that job to a woman because she is a woman - fucking ridiculous.","1443657889"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Based on your tastes (which are very similar to mine), I'd recommend **Forbidden Desert** or **Dead Men Tell No Tales**. Both are some good, challenging co-op games that take 45-90 minutes to get through. I'd go for whichever theme gets you. Personally I've been loving DMNT, and I've probably been recommending it too much. Forbidden Desert definitely has less rules to explain, but I like the theme and components in DMNT more. Both **Betrayal on House on the Hill** and **Dead of Winter** are good co-op games with defector (betrayer) aspects in them with horror themes. I also just recently played **Mice &amp; Mystics** for the first time, and liked it a lot. Great miniatures in that one, too.

"AMA","t5_2r4eo","Depends on the context, I suppose. Different things can be sad in different ways. I'll mention three different sad moments:

The first was when one of our customers was getting close to the end of her life. She'd been a ""husk"" for quite a long time at that point, never saying anything, always sitting by the table and looking into the distance. She was a sweet little thing. I once caught sight of her old marriage photos from the and she looked like she belonged in Holywood! Anyway, about three days or so before she passed, at a point where she was in bed all day and could barely drink liquids, I was fluffing up her pillow and about to say goodnight when she grabbed my hand, looked me in the eyes and said ""You're so sweet."" Last thing she ever said to me. 

The second was when I was sitting with another customer watching tv. He seemed a bit distressed, so I asked him what was wrong.
""It hurts.""
""Where does it hurt?""
""I don't know. Everywhere.""
Then he looked around for a few seconds, and said
""I don't know where I am.""
It was the most lucid experience I'd ever seen him have. 

The third is whenever the old germany lady talks about visiting her parents' farm. She starts crying, talks about how she'd ride the horses on the fields and explore the forest and talk with all the animals. Then she'd ask me if we could visit the farm together the next day. I always say yes, even though it and everyone in it was bombed during WW2, because she won't remember in the morning anyway.","1443657892"

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Heres what most people do in California.

Your ticket has a date you must appear on, this is the date of your arraignment. Youll go infront of a judge and plead either guilty or not guilty (youll choose not guilty)

Next, the judge will give you a court date and youll go to the clerk to get some paper work for the next court appearance which will be the trial. This date is usually 3-6 months from the date of arraignment. Many people request an extension near the actual date of their court and the date is extended another 3-6 months from the date you request the extension (do it near your trial date; must be 2 weeks or more before your trial date to request extension). Many people do this because they believe the longer you wait the less the officer will remember and more of a chance that the officer will not show up on the day of your trial.

On the day of your trial three things can happen.
Best case scenario: officer does not show up to defend his ticket and the ticket is thrown out and you walk away

IF the officer shows up
Option A: stick with your plea and go to trial and explain to the judge why you believe you are not guilty (this sometimes works to at least reduce penalty fees).
Option B: you change your plea to no contest (since the cop showed up and you think there is no chance to win) and you are given the fine instead of proceeding with trial.

Now with the two options above, A and B, youll want to ask for traffic school regardless at the end. Since this is your first infraction the judge will most likely give you this even though you proceeded with trial. 

Last note now that I'm writing about it, the judge will say that by pleading not guilty you may become ineligible for traffic school, this is sometimes true but most of the time it is just a way to get people to quickly plead guilty and not spend money on the trial.

"darksouls3","t5_2w3z3","Eh, despite its shortcomings I'd say I vastly prefer it to DeS and DaS1 PvP. The number of viable competitive setups in those games was limited to around the same amount of weapons as BB has altogether and there's genuinely nothing in BB as grossly OP as most DaS1 or DeS builds. Chikage has some crazy modifiers on the unzip attack but it's a single, easily avoidable attack. Closest thing to OP I'd say there is. 

Everything is viable besides maybe the Beast Claw, and even then I've had a handful of people wreck me with them. I rarely run into the same weapon twice in a row, and people are constantly running into new techniques to punish wakeups and so on. There's also the fact that most weapons individually have more animations than entire classes in Souls do, and I feel that makes for some pretty tense, compelling fights when you're up against someone who's intimately familiar with all 24-32 moves available to them.

I definitely prefer the customization and diversity of DaS2's PvP by a *wide* margin, but I don't think BB's PvP is shite or anything like that. It initially felt really chaotic, but after spending a few hundred hours with it I think there's more nuance to it than the PvP in other Miyazaki titles. ","1443657897"

""According to one's own intellect, each will describe You differently""

Sri Guru Gobind Singh, Beanti Chaupi
(credit to /u/mrpaneer for using that recently)

So sikhs try to serve Waheguru, and many sikhs devote their lives to waheguru, as is the goal of pretty much all sikhs. Sikhi comes from north india, specifically in a region called the punjab. There are 10 people who we call our gurus, they told us about what sikhi is. The 10th guru gave the final guruship to a book which had been compiled by the gurus of poetry over the past two centuries. The poetry had been written by sikhs, muslims, and hindus.

"suggestmeabook","t5_31t41","Kurt Vonnegut is a great author. He is a very enjoyable writer and frothy--lovely. Empathetic and witty and even learned in a very formal, perhaps surprising, manner.

I think Slaughterhouse-Five is his most formally 'difficult' work, and unfortunately I think its difficulty is almost all for show. Unfortunate because I think that, also unfortunate because it is an accurate statement. The book is like it was designed to be just difficult enough to give high school teachers something to talk about for thirty minutes, but not actually difficult enough to hurt the precarious attention span of your average classroom. Not understanding or actively misunderstanding some or all of the experimentation hardly effects peoples' collective and individual enjoyment and understanding of the novel. So the book ends up being, to me, at least, evidently exasperating. This is the guy who wrote *Player Piano* and *God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater*! Why is he burdening himself with this? What does it add? 

Admittedly I like the formal experimentation, though I think others do it better, because I am always a sucker for even the most tired experimental tropes. But I would definitely steer clear from Slaughterhouse-Five just because, at times, what he wants to say and what he may even *need* to say gets interrupted by this self-conscious impulse that has little to do with him at all. Reading almost anything else he has ever written will be better.

I don't know why he threw in those semi-cheesy viewpoint shifts and, as the French New Novelists would say, 'cooled down' Slaughterhouse-Five in preparation of stealing the reader's energy. I've read much if not everything that has been published by him and it's an odd aberration. He is great because he is straightforward, concise, brief and ordinary while still being interesting. 

I think, apart from Slaughterhouse-Five, his best are *Cat's Cradle* and *Slapstick*, though I am a big fan of *Mother Night* and even (gasp!) *Hocus Pocus*. You really can't go wrong. ","1443657900"

It might be worth having individual chats with your friends and acknowledge that there will naturally be a change in dynamic, but you want to keep it a positive relationship that will be mutually beneficial- you'll do your very best for them in your new role, and you'd like for them to continue with the good work that they were giving to their previous manager. 

 With regards social situations, there's no harm in arranging things under the basis of a team night out/ team building etc, but you might find it easier to make an exit when the drink starts flowing. That way if anything inappropriate happens on a work night out you aren't obliged to act on it unless completely necessary.

Most of all, listen to your staff. Work out what motivates them- family, money, travelling, whatever. Help them with little things where you can- that extra five minutes at lunch or getting them car park access could take you no time to sort out, but they'll remember that you made things a little easier and it'll show in their work.

Remind them that feedback goes two ways- you'll be evaluating them as their manager, but you'd appreciate if they'd tell you what they feel you could improve on. Listen to what they say- sure, they'll be some moaning about things that you can't do much about, but it can be valuable to catch your own blind spots. 

Good luck in the new job!","1443657903"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;No, hes exceptionally easy to balance given that pinks and red sweepers are so readly available now his stealth is nolonger very strong.

This is what I'm saying about high vs low elos. At high elos his invisibility is pretty weak because people appropriately upgrade to t2 sweepers, they carry pinks in their inventory to drop during teamfights, they pink ward bushes around the map, they ward shacos camps to track him across the map etc. 

None of this is done at low elo. So his invisibility is very much a factor there. So if you balance him around the assumption that people will appropriately pink ward and upgrade sweepers and use them effectively, then when they don't do that in low elo he will be inordinately strong. It's just the nature of champions that are countered by warding and vision control to be weaker at higher elos and stronger at lower elos.

I agree that there could be ways to balance him by reducing his early game snowballing and increasing his late game potential and give him a more balanced power curve that isn't so early game centric. But I'm just saying that that would require more than just a numbers tweak, it would require actual changes to how his abilities function. I'm not at all saying he's fundamentally impossible to balance, just saying it's not going to be a simple task due to the fact that his invisibility is weak at high elos but very useful at low elos.

And yes, it would be a great start if they fixed all the bugs with his boxes and clones. That's definitely something that should be fixed regardless of whether he needs buffs or nerfs. Clunky or buggy gameplay is not conducive good game balance.","1443657903"

no we didn't, I was just pointing out the Cluster B statements.

I can afford a drum machine, but I'm smart enough to realize I dont need one with my current skillset. 
Sure, it might improve workflow, but other pieces of hardware would be more valuable in doing so at the moment.

What happened after 10-6? What has happened since then? What will happen this season? I'm not coming out with pitchforks, but if this season is a bust, it seems very incorrect that Mayhew is not at least partially responsible. 2 wildcard playoff appearances that were both losses (one a very compelling loss), are not a strong indicator of success.

Lollipop has made the phone slow and the battery life abysmal, and none of the fixes suggested have worked.

I'm very hesitant about the 6P's size, as I like to carry my phone in my front pocket, but it's such a value and I've never had a large phone before, so I thought I might as well try one once. 

I want clean and frequently updated Android, I want an OS build that can be easily modified, and I want a well-built phone that won't feel sub-par after a year. Camera, performance, and most importantly battery life matter, too. The Nexus 6P seems like the right choice.","1443657908"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","My sister met a guy at work in May. By June they were dating. He proposed in October. They got married in February. She had a baby in June. After their first child was born, he admitted to having a daughter already. My sister, like you, was more focused on the idea of the previous child than any of the red flags. She wanted him to pay child support and have a relationship with his daughter. She saw the good person he could be rather than who he actually was. 

He's a serial cheater and now her ex husband...but it was a long, painful process and they have four children that had to deal with their fighting, his drama, and all kinds of crap before they finally split.

Don't make the same mistakes as my sister. 

Don't rush headlong into a serious relationship before you have time to get to know someone. If you want to pursue a relationship with him, take it slow. It's okay (and usually a good idea) to wait a couple years before taking any big steps like moving in together or getting married. Also, manage your own birth control.


Don't ignore obvious character flaws. It's noble to expect the best in others, and most people will strive to live up to your expectations - however, someone who doesn't want to change will never change.


And finally, don't be afraid to talk to his exes. If you are going to have a future with him, his children (and by extension their mothers) are going to be part of your life too. If all 3 of them tell you to run, it's probably good advice.","1443657912"

I meant no offense by my post, I was just saying the some Open Class Corps are pretty darn good - better in some ways than some World Class Corps. This was my son's first year marching and since he marched Open Class, I saw the Open Class championships in Michigan City and I was blown away with how good they all were.  Even tiny Racine Scouts impressed me.  I sat through the entire day of prelims so we saw a LOT of corps and I honestly loved every single one of them.  I even enjoyed the foreigners.  JUBAL!!!  I was used to World Class corps melting my face but didn't realize how good Open Class was - now I know. 

I don't measure corps by their scores.  I cheer for my favorites but I'm OK with wherever they place.  I was hoping for Crown to get first because I loved ""Inferno"" so much but I don't love their show any less because they got silver.  

I agree about marching ""lower level"" corps - they're awesome and I think it can really help younger people learn what drum corps is all about. My son tried out for Bloo last year but didn't make it.  He told me at one his camps that if he had made Bloo it would have killed him.  He's much better prepared to survive a world class season after having marched a shorter open class season.  And they work hard, often with less recognition than the top corps get.  ","1443657913"

&gt;  Canadian professional ice hockey right winger who played 13 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Boston Bruins, California Golden Seals, Philadelphia Flyers and Detroit Red Wings. He is best known for his time in Philadelphia, winning a Stanley Cup with the Flyers in 1975 and being a member of the LCB line.

Dude raised some athletes too, from the wiki again:

&gt; Reggie and his two children have all represented Canada - Reggie with Team Canada in 1976; Jamie in the World Juniors in 1989; and his daughter Brandie also represented Canada in the world Lacrosse championships in Scotland in 1991-92.

It would be a real honor to have a Flyers hall-of-famer and old time hockey pro to ask some questions.

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","First, you're doing okay! Your baby is thriving and he's getting food and he's lucky to have such a caring mom! 

I would recommending against replacing any feedings with formula. Anytime that your breasts are not receiving stimulation from your LO, they won't get the signal to produce more milk. I would put your baby to breast as often as needed. Afterwards you can give him supplementation. Instead of using a bottle, have you thought about using a supplementation system that attaches to your nipple like this [Medela Supplementation System](http://www.amazon.com/Medela-009-0003-Supplemental-Nursing-System/dp/B000W73YKY)? There are also other brands available and Medela has a [smaller version] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G87KYE/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1944687562&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B000W73YKY&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0CK2DXBJ5SWP9ZTQP7Z0). What these do is essentially provide any liquid supplementation you want to use via a small tube that you attach to your nipple using tape. Your LO would then actively suck on your nipple while the tube is in his mouth thereby getting the supplementation but also stimulating your breast and learn to be at the breast. I used this system when I had problems breastfeeding early on. It takes a bit of work, but I found it extremely helpful. 

Second, the amount of breastmilk you get from a pump is never a good indication of how much milk you have. As it'll be said over and over, your baby is so much more efficient at removing breastmilk than a normal pump can. If you can to bump up supply, try pumping both breasts after each feeding session for 5-10 minutes to give your breasts signals to make more milk. I know that this sounds like a lot of work and believe me, it totally is; you literally feel that your time revolves around feeding the baby, cleaning the SNS, and then pumping (I went through it all).

Third, as [\u\barnetto] (https://www.reddit.com/user/barnetto)said, you can try weighing him at home for piece of mind. You can rent hospital grade weigh stations to use at home. Just weigh him prior to eating and after eating to get an idea of how much he's getting.

Fourth, in terms of ""overfeeding,"" as your supply grows, what you can do is cut down on the amount of supplementation that you give him. Maybe just give him 1oz and see how he responds. 

Whatever you decide doing, try not to replace any of his feedings with a bottle, go to breast first, or at the minimum pump and use that milk to supplement if you want to get some sleep. Hang in there Mama, you're on your way!!! Try not to worry (I know we all do), but enjoy your time with him! Your feeding sessions are your bonding sessions!","1443657916"

"ClashOfClans","t5_2usfk","For TH6? Usually get yourself about 20 Giants, 6 wallbreakers, 6 wiz and the rest archers. CC a max healer and max wiz if you can, or archers is great.

At this level, CC lures are easy. 1 Giant. Use 1 archer to lure CC in open space. Preferably on the side of the base with the air defense. Surround CC with 10-15 archers and then 1-2 wiz. When CC dies, drop all your giants in front of these troops. Wallbreak in, using 2 wallbreakers at a time. Use your heal spells until your Giants take down the air defense. Reinforce 1-2 wizards and archers as the Giants start going throught the base. If they start going one direction, put the reinforcements on that side. Drop the CC healer as soon as the Air defense goes down.

If you are doing this at early TH7, you should pick bases with really spread air defenses. Use 1-2 heals early to take out the first air defense, drop CC healer. By the time the Giants go to the other side of the base, 2/3 of the base should be destroyed. After the healer dies, use the last heal in the middle of the last 4-5 defenses. I would use 22-24 Giants here and a few more wizards. And get 2 of your barracks up to level 9 asap and stop messing around with Giant healer at TH7.

When I say that the wars get more complex, you're having to deal with more countries being allied to the target (of course, you can also have more allies). It can get especially ~~infuriating~~ fun when a country who owns a few provinces you want is allied to all of the countries you're allied to. It's happened to be before.

It's especially fun when you declare war on a member of the empire, so they get to call in their allies *and* the emperor calls in *his* allies. No, really. I had just unlocked cannons, and that war was nail-biting at times.","1443657918"

If I remember correctly, [this](http://i.imgur.com/AEj7sPm.gifv) is pretty much the gif that started this sub. It made me laugh. And a large part of that humor was in the humanization. A power drill can malfunction, but it cannot screw up or fail comically. This garbage truck can, because it does something on its own. In my opinion, that's the spirit of this sub.

Now we get a device that was designed for a certain purpose and excels at it. And it's not trying to do anything by itself, it's completely controlled by a human. It has no spirit, it's just a machine. If that thing crashed, we would think the pilot made a mistake. Nobody would laugh about that.

"wow","t5_2qio8","&gt; Are they basically a joke now?

In general, all raids up through Cataclysm are a joke at this point and can be pretty easily soloed by any class. Mists of Pandaria raids are somewhat soloable, although some classes will have less difficulty than others.

&gt; Are they balanced in such a way that you still need coordinated groups to get through them?

No, although there are some boss encounters with mechanics that implicitly require multiple people.

Some specific encounters may actually be slightly harder now than they were originally, because they contain mechanics that still must be done correctly and are designed for a party of more than one person. Razorgore in Blackwing Lair, for example, has a mechanic where you have to mind control him to destroy eggs before you kill him, but the adds will attack him while you're mind controlling him, and there's enough eggs that the adds can kill him before you finish; he instakills you if he dies before the eggs are all destroyed.

There is some hope (by myself and others) that, in some way or another, Timewalking will be implemented into classic raids as it is in a weekly event for TBC and WotLK dungeons and will serve a role similar to level sync in FFXIV-- scale you down to the level/item level range of the content you're doing so that it is nontrivial. Blizzard has yet to do this, but I think they will within the next few patches at the rate things are going.

&gt; If I were to hop in to WoW at this point, would I be missing a ton of content that just isn't there anymore because I wasn't around for its original era?

In the grand scheme of things, there is remarkably little content besides most of the Vanilla content that has actually been *removed* from the game.

A few instances have been redesigned/rereleased for higher level play than they were originally designed for, but none have been ever fully dropped. Warlord's of Draenor's revamp of Upper Blackrock Spire is the only case where I'd say the new version of the instance is arguably a replacement of the old one.

The only things that are pretty much genuinely *gone* from the game are most of the original Vanilla quest/leveling experience, which was redone almost completely in Cataclysm. Most of the content that builds up to the original Vanilla raids has been removed and as a result some of the pre-60 instances don't make a lot of sense. There's been a few temporary patch-based events--e.g. Varian's blow up where he tried to kill Sylvanas and Thrall, Vol'jin's rebellion, etc. that are gone and the legendary quest in Pandaria is no longer achieveable, but that's about it.

All of that probably seems like a lot, but besides the quest/leveling stuff it accounts for only maybe 5-10% of everything that has been implemented into the game, if that. The quest/leveling stuff was also *replaced* by newer (and according to most, better) quest/leveling content in Cataclysm, so it's not necessarily a loss per se.

&gt; Side question: How long would you say it takes to get ""in"" to this game? I've tried WoW a few times before, but I find I always get disinterested during the first few hours, and I believe that's really just because I'm stuck doing the opening content, which is perhaps not representative of what makes the game beloved by so many.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to stick it out this time, so I can reach the end game, but I'd just like to know how long it will take for things to get more interesting.

I started playing during Mists of Pandaria and honestly I started having fun when I stopped doing the low level quest content and started doing instances with guild mates.

The quests actually started being pretty enjoyable when I got into the TBC and WotLK level range (60+). I know know there are also some decent quests at lower levels and I just picked the wrong zones to level in.","1443657919"

He doesn't do a massive amount of defending because he's more help to the team being ready for the counter attack. Then win more games by him not coming back too far than they lose by him not helping to defend enough.

Starting to think I might just have to get one of my genuinely badass PvP playing friends to carry me through it.

And don't get me started on Skirmish and Salvage. Skirmish was fine because I did it as the daily, so there were enough players to have two teams of randoms so I just murdered everyone. But Salvage was horrible. Three games in a row I got exactly 15 kills, and in that time my teammates got a combined total of 9. One of those games my teammate ran headfirst at the enemy without even stopping to rez so many times that he got a 0.04 KD. That was insanely frustrating when I was consistently getting the most kills.

In the end I grabbed a friend to ensure I had at least one competent team mate and got the 2 wins in 2 games (just barely on the second, the 3rd guy was just insanely bad).","1443657919"

"homelab","t5_2ubz7","I don't know about *more* compatible, but it's certainly compatible. My big problem with AMD chips is one of the things that make them popular - they're mid range budget conscious cpus, which makes them popular with gaming college kids on a budget. Intel literally owns the market on both low end, low power draw and terrifyingly powerful, while AMD sits in the middle, and doesn't do anything particularly well except perform decently for a really good price. They're best bang for your buck without doing anything particularly well. That's not to say they won't work, but as far as I know every major hypervisor is made to support Intel from the ground up, which makes them the go to for me. I'd say for your case, you'd want low power/low draw, since cpu isn't a huge deal in virtualization, but power, noise and size are for a home lab. I'd say Atom/Avoton would fit your scenario well.

You might also consider your networking options under a hypervisor. The big three (KVM/Hyper-V/VMWare) all have robust internal routing capabilities that makes mimicing an actual network and several physical machines very possible. Subnetting, VLANs, routing, firewalls are all possible internally, as well as with external equipment. You can set up a subnet within your hypervisor, have it route out to a physical switch and router, then back in and on to another subnet of VMs on the same host. About the only thing you can't do is set up actual production failover (since killing the machine kills everything), but you could pull the virtual plug on one set of VMs and have it failover to another set on the same host. The possibilites are pretty limitless given a powerful enough machine. Just something to keep in mind.","1443657927"

"programming","t5_2fwo","As much as people will disagree in a knee-jerk way, this is one of the reasons I'm really excited about PHP 7.

Implicitly/dynamically typed languages are almost always easier to get something *done* in, but tend to be much harder to maintain and debug.

PHP 7 is changing the language so that you have the following typing options:

1. Continue to use PHP the way it has worked in the past. Type-juggling with eager transformation.
2. Use a defined typing system that documents which transformations will occur, and ensures type safety within specific scopes. This restricts the type-casting to casts which cannot narrow the type (e.g. int -&gt; float is okay, float -&gt; int is not).
3. Use a defined typing system that forces strong typing in all scopes that it is used.

You can mix 1 and 2, or 1 and 3, but not 2 and 3. 

This allows you to use type-safe code anywhere that you might have maintainability problems, or that you need to make sure there's no ambiguity, but you can still take advantage of the speed and ease of dynamic typing for code you need to prototype, or for code that is less mission critical.","1443657927"

"AdventureCapitalist","t5_32lqw","70 isn't ridiculous at all and actually more optimal to do a reset there if you didn't purchase the upgrade, but we can consider a much worse scenario: we keep on going on going until we get 96. Let's call this scenario A and scenario B will be where you purchased the upgrade.
  
By the time A reaches 96, B won't have reached 120 (48x2 + 24) to double up and recuperate. In fact, B will reach 116 when A reaches 96. Let's say you knew this and decided to reset B at 116.
  
So the goal for this next reset for A when starting at 96 will be 216 (96x2 + 24) and B when starting at 116 will be 256 (116x2 + 24). Comparing both scenarios, B has a 20.8% boost (116/96). After both purchase the x5 upgrade, B has an even better boost at 27.8% ((116-24)/(96-24)). Sounds great right? Well, not really. By the time A reaches its goal, B won't be there b/c it actually requires a 50.5% boost; B will only be able to reach 230 by the time A resets. I didn't calculate what A would be at by the time B reaches 256 since it's a worse option than resetting.
  
You can do the math yourself, but the summary is that even though B has a higher multiplier and seems to be ahead, it has to work much harder to keep earning angels.","1443657933"

So unless you are going to get on every thread like that, you should probably shut up about it.

And I do understand copyright law, and I also understand fair use.   The fact is, none of the companies can prove any loss of money because people are downloading copies of unsupported games.   And since they are not supporting those games anymore, the games will fall under fair use/abandon ware.    This is the reason why you don't see anyone every being prosecuted for downloading copies of games for old systems.  No one gets prosecuted for hosting those games.   

The companies know they will lose them to fair use, which is why they want to keep it status quo.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Okay, so you've discovered that there really are such things as negative entities, that are non-material (unlike ourselves in our current material form of existence), inhabit a reality context from which they can enter into ours with relative ease - sometimes there is an audible popping noise when they do, really like to mess with (prey or energy feed) on human beings as they find them relatively easy to foster strong emotions in, and usually exude a very negative energetic sensation that registers viscerally to your consciousness.

Be calm and know who you are and who you be long to. When they enter your presence pray for heavenly protection - call on Jesus name when doing so. If possible get someone to hold your hand and pray with you.

They can come into your presence in your waking life but especially like to go at you in your sleep when your body has induced it's own paralysis to keep you from sleep walking when dreaming. They have been messing with humanity for thousands of years and know these kind of vulnerabilities about us.

This phenomena is very well known to many cultures - modern Americans are highly insular and of course so adoptive of secular Materialist assumptions even when believing themselves to be religious or spiritual.

If we seek the assistance of Heaven by which to repel them, we will be listened to. You can request angelic defense to have a wall around you. Sign, seal, and deliver that request in Jesus' name.

Why me is always the refrain? Sometimes we are permitted to be exposed to some things as a kind of boot camp experience. It's opportunity to mature spiritually and flex aspects of spiritual growth and conscious awareness that otherwise we remain lethargic in.","1443657941"

Like there is this great quote she wrote in a letter *to some black pasters who asked her to come to their church and teach birth control* about how she is worried that if she does that some people will think she is some horrible racist eugenist but if the pastors were to send some local ladies up to visit her she'd walk them through the program and they could disseminate the information back home.  

Lying Liars who Lie A Lot like to take that letter and quote it out of context.  They pretend it is an internal PP memo *about* black people rather than an external communication *with* some black community leaders.  Then they pull their tin foil fedora's tightly around their ears while sticking their noses into the air and acting superior.

I think Capstan blue is one of the nicest VA blends out there right now (although with the recent price hike, it's a bit pricey, but worth it).

GL Pease Gaslight is my current favorite English. It's pretty full bodied and has an amazing range/depth of flavor.  Another really nice English is Esoterica Margate (you can also get it topped with French cognac, which is Pembroke).  I also really enjoy Gawith Commonwealth and Winter Time Flake (winter is 50/50 VA/Lat presented in a nice broken flake). They're not as dimensional as gaslight, but at least with winter, you can really identify both flavors well.","1443657948"

To drain the thing in one effort, and then sleep away the coming days. His cousins' warnings echoed with him again like they had most of the day. It was still unbelievable, he'd surely have nightmares again without the wine. The shades of his past would haunt him endlessly tonight.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","This might be something you missed but some of the quests we'll get will have a procedurally generated element; One mini-quest will lead us to another.

An example would be that you are tasked with recouvering some cargo from a derelict. You could find a data chip in one of the cargo containers or scan the ship's logs and find news of a specific location mentioned somewhere. This could lead you to a host of encounters when you reach *that* destination and so on. The level of challenge would likely rise with each successive stage of the quest, as will the payoff.

A PG quest system might work well to generate stories for players, as well as mulitplying the content to them (no quest is ever exactly the same, new quest elements change the quest system as a whole). What's important to the system, however, is that CIG finds a way to turn the quests into a coherent story. For example, a derelict that falls to pirate attack at the beginning of the quest leads us to a final encounter with them at the end or the item you were tasked to find in the first place ends up with you playing space detective, chasing the item across the galaxy to finally recover it.","1443657952"

I always say that while [holding Bitcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/im-hoarding-bitcoins-and-no-you-cant-have-any/) is speculation, based on my observtions of the growing Bitcoin ecosystem and investments into the infrastructure, I believe that the upside potential is far greater than the downside risk. Yes, you could lose $200 but it probably wouldn't negatively effect your life that much, however, if Bitcoin does take off than that $200 would likely be worth many times more than that. Would you risk $200 for a potential $3,000; $30,000; $300,000; or even a million dollar return 5-10 years from now?","1443657953"

As for monitors, I swapped in a 144hz monitor. Keep in mind that 144hz 1080p monitors are currently only using TN panels. If you buy a 1080p 60hz monitor later, I'd highly recommend an IPS panel as they cost the same now. (23"" 1080p IPS 60hz Acer monitor is $130). IPS has MUCH better colors and viewing angles compared to TN.

"medicalschool","t5_2re2p","So, I decided to copy/paste and add some thoughts to my comment replies that might get hidden if OP is viewing this on a not-throwaway account. 

There are some instances where the health of a physician should be reported to the board or [especially in the case of mental health] to an agency that will provide help - WITHOUT suspending your license. With appropriate treatment, depression [beyond being suicidal, or with intent to harm others - which OP hasn't expressed as a part of his symptoms] isn't included among the conditions that could ""affect his practice"" *if I am not mistaken*.

If it is, it shouldn't be, and is only contributing to the stigma of seeking help for depression.
Schizophrenia, and other such disorders, I could understand HIPAA needing to disclose to a 3rd party, but [non-suicidal] depression I don't see any need to be reported.

Now, it may be that as a result of his/her ACTUAL depression symptoms, that they suffer somewhat in terms of climbing up the ladder - but under appropriate treatment, hopefully OP can beat this thing.

Edit - I know it's not comprehensive, but check this out OP - http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/home/article/physician-impairment-when-should-you-report/b96b78e7be21952839fac3aef998fbb8.html

The general idea is that as long as you aren't significantly impaired, it is unlikely that you will be reported [by psych, or by other physicians]. It seems to me that depression would impair you more than getting treatment for it. Your call, but I think the right thing for your future patients is to be the best that you can be. If your depression is getting in the way of your studies, and your eventual treatment of patients, you should consider seeking treatment.

Meanwhile, as long as there's a door or a stall, or just no one else in the room, I have no problems.  Hell, as long as I can ""start the river flowing"" I can keep it going if someone else walks in.

&gt;Still, the overall look of the game becoming more gritty is definitely the agenda Bill took off with when he became in charge of art direction. It was both his own preference but also seeded from many requests from the community over the years.

Gritty is one thing you can call it. You can also call it ugly, boring and unimaginative, as I prefer to do. 'Grittiness' can also be conveyed through visual wear and tear on existing colors and logos, model design, animations, and audio effects, without just making everything a shade of grey and calling it a night.

&gt;If you would actually care to check the links I provided, then you would have known that I've been suggesting for this game to become less Clownside 2 since early 2013. In fact, I invented the term Clownside 2 and have been using it since then in various forums just to get this issue on the developer agenda. 

This sounds to me more like you're desperate for somebody to notice your *so witty* term you *invented* and apply it to anything remotely colorful or blocky. I did scroll through a few of those links, and you regularly seem to use Mass Effect art and characters as a 'guide' for what you want, which in my opinion is pretty much the go-to standard for *boring round space suit soldiers in space*, as it's mostly just smooth suits with a bunch of overdesigned crap added on for visual noise for the sake of being noisy.","1443657957"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Chicken wrangler here. I eat chicken abortions all the time. 

Let me break it down. I'm not so much an 'egg producer'.. I have 4 hens and a rooster.

My girls get clucky and broody about this time of year, and will remain so until they either have some chicks, or February arrives. When their clucky those little ovaries are pumping out delicious little bum nuts every 18 hours or so. But if you let that bitch sit on her eggs (a process called incubation) she'll shut up shop and conserve her energy intending to spend several weeks keeping her clutch warm. 

So unless you want to be pimping bitches who ain't producing, you gotta steal them eggs. This is called 'robbing'. The basic principle is that you want to rob the eggs until late in the season to keep that ho putting out through most of the season. My ladies of leisure understand this dynamic and I believe they've come to respect our symbiotic arrangement.

All this is pretty exasperating for the rooster. Poor guy is beside himself with four clucky chicks demanding  his affections for 3 months straight. He's gonna lose some weight over summer. Anyhow, my rooster stud is a spunky little fucker and i reckon he's got a few seasons left in him. He's going to rutt his way around the chicken run for as long as he's required to do so.

Anyhow, fertilised eggs do not develop a phoetus (spelling?) Until at least 7 days of hard core incubation. So eating 'robbed' eggs does not involve cracking open a little golden bundle of joy to find an itty bitty chicken inside, but rather it's an egg like any other, plus a few extra chromosomes. Yumm!

Thus, a robbed egg is one with the potential to develop a phoetus, but will not, given that the incubation process has been aborted. ","1443657958"

Women get paid a lot more in STEM professions than men. If they choose to pursue child-rearing instead of a STEM profession there isn't anything you can do to stop them. 


Any man who makes the same life decisions would experience the same reduced earning potential due to his lack of experience in the work place. 

You're trying to legislate in order to correct a problem we both acknowledge is rooted in the behavioral choices of women. 

That is insanity. 

Any woman who wants to pursue career goals instead of familial goals already can - and will make about 17% more than a man doing the same thing.

The reason is linked to the fact that hiring women gets you a free advertising component included when you release your statistics showing a jump in female managerial/STEM positions. Female candidates are more valued than male candidates due to this reason, and experience a premium pay because of it. 

Despite that premium many women still choose to stay at home with their degree. There is nothing wrong with that decision and it isn't your decision to make.

Have you or some comedian ever made a rape joke? Do you think you (or him) would actually rape someone or think rape is actually funny in a real setting? Probably not. That's my point.

With your familiarity of the study, can you then explain why they would talk about the overly negative effects and then try to soften it by saying ""the negative welfare effects may be exaggerated"" and then not include the global avg income raise?  Or does that global avg income increase take into account the income growth of TTIP countries and the decline of non-TTIP countries and say growth is overall positive thanks to countries participating?  I'm considering their summary point #11 (not to mention the job losses suggested elsewhere)-
&gt; If the non-tariff barriers between EU and USA are liberalized in addition to the tariffs, the per capita income in a global average rises a good 3.27%. The trade diversion effects are, in comparison to the customs scenario, only insignificantly larger, but distributed among third countries in a different way. Now the traditional trading partners of the USA, such as Mexico, Canada and Chile experience substantial losses; likewise Australia, Japan and Israel each lose between 9.5 und 5.5%. These countries therefore have strong incentives to participate in negotiating the liberalization of non-tariff barriers","1443657963"

Our real estate values only went down about 5% in 2009-2010, and as many were their own bosses, our unemployment hovered at around 6% (slightly less, I believe).  Of course, we're not big on big-box stores - we only have 2 Walmarts in our state, no Targets, 2 Home Depots.  But we have large companies: Whistle Pig Whiskey and Tata Harper Skin Care (within a few miles), IBM and GE a little further than that.  A local rental in a good commercial area had a sign in its window saying, ""For Rent: No Starbucks Need Apply"", which I think reflects how we protect small business, as there are already three cafés in town.

I hear this.  Community and support and not being judged for where you're at will help a lot.  A ton actually.  I know that bullshit very well, and it is maddening.  The only thing that can be done is to walk through it and begin to work a process.  Negativity as an IDENTITY comes from somewhere.  It isn't ""your brain"", it's your SHAPED brain.  The earliest social environment and relationships.  Self-defeating behavior allows us to ""stay alive"".   And that role has as it's aim to remain alone so as to never get fucked over.  Because it already happened very early in life.  Again...community.  Other people who have been there.  Not being judged.  Saying what's going on.  That has to be built.  It can pull a guy out of the mud.  Anger-tears....over never getting real needs met.

How does us dying relate to that? You could replace dying with eating or drinking. How would the message be any different?

I feel like you missed out by writing: ""When we die, someone else is born"", because that is the main circle that is being followed when people talk about death. People are dying all the time and people are being born all the time.

I guess, I don't really understand your point (why does it matter the exact moment of death?) and it doesn't seem like much of a koan either... hmm...

"tf2","t5_2qka0","This might not pertain to the regular randomizer mod, but whatever. I was on a x10 randomizer server once as a Scout with the Syringe Gun, the Battalion's Backup, and the Warrior's Spirit. The Warrior's Spirit may have lowered my health, but for some reason the Battalion's Backup health bonus far exceeded the health penalty and I was sitting at around ~200-300ish health.


Anyway, the Warrior's Spirit does a shit load of damage on x10, and with the Scout's speed, a health boost, and massive defense buff for 100 seconds (even more HP and immunity to crits), this loadout was like a facestabbing heavy on crack. I just walked up to people, took almost no damage, punched them square in the face, then ran, occasionally using the Syringe Gun's x10 firing speed as I backpedaled. I had around ~70 kills in that one life, and dominated almost the entire enemy team. I was an unstoppable monster until the round ended (I was on defense). Sadly, I played this before Gun Mettle, so no health restore on hit with Warrior's Spirit, it would have been even more of a nightmare to play against.","1443657968"

If your deck isn't good enough to run the full Frost Arena, just do what you can and get the gold from the early levels. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Yes, it gets repetitive. There's very limited PVE content so far.

If you're trying to stay free to play (or minimize your expenditure) your first priority should probably be to get a decent PVE deck together so you can effectively earn gold.

So your initial steps would be:

* Play PVE 
* Got to auction house and buy a card(s) to improve your deck
* Repeat until you can clear Frost Arena cleanly and reliably

Since you're starting with Shin'hare you should use that as your basis to improve:

Also check out nicosharp's ABT series of budget decks. I don't think he's done a Shin'hare specific one but they may give you some ideas, here's his latest:

For card values, resources are:

Once you have a good PVE deck then decide if you want to play drafts or gauntlet (I'd suggest constructed is probably out of your budget at this point but YMMV) then your path is:

* Play PVE 
* Got to auction house and buy Armies of Myth boosters for gold
* Sell Armies of Myth boosters for platinum
* Repeat until you have enough boosters and enough platinum
* Play draft/gauntlet
* Repeat (sell off cards to improve efficiency)

Generally in CCGs it's a bad idea to open boosters for any other reason than as part of a tournament.

"toronto","t5_2qi63","&gt; Because the portion that Toronto pays out (i.e taken by both Ontario and the federal government) towards taxes and everything else is far greater than that amount it received by several orders of magnitude

Then that's not really the fault of the drivers is it? If you think Toronto isn't getting a big enough piece of the pie, talk to your MPP or MPs. Saying drivers don't pay enough doesn't mean anything; they could pay more and possibly not see any increase in spending.

&gt; Basically, the money you quote was Toronto's own money coming back to it. 

It's GAS tax money. Who pays taxes on gas? Drivers. Not transit users.

Drivers pay all the same taxes that transit users pay, but instead of paying for a TTC pass they pay gas taxes, sales taxes on purchase or sale of vehicles, insurance, plate renewal fees, vehicle registration fee, and emission test fees. That's all mandatory owning a vehicle. What happens with all those taxes is irrelevant. 

As a driver you only see what you're paying into the pot and to say we're subsidized by people who pay less tax is hilarious","1443657975"

"livesound","t5_2remi","Here is my .02. I went to one of those audio engineering schools, not full sail but something just like it. It was a 9 month course and then a 2-3 month internship. Now, this school will give you whatever you put into it. It gave me a great foundation from which to start working in the industry. The other side to this is of course your attitude when starting out. People will see it and take notice, good or bad. 

I have been in this industry for 13 years now and have a house gig that is pretty well desired and I do freelancing as well. However, I have been going back to school to pursue an EE degree.

Why? Well a couple reasons, one, the company I work for has a tuition reimbursement program. Two, while I am more than capable of working in this biz, I know my foundational knowledge when it comes to the science and math behind it had gaps. Plus, having worked at this house gig for a decade, I got bored and really needed something else to challenge me. This has worked for me and my situation. Yours might be different. 

All that said, IMO audio schools will give you the very basic tools necessary to get into the industry, the rest is totally on you. They are also FAR cheaper than a 4-year uni. However, a degree can be a pretty significant difference in beginning pay, So you really need to weigh each choice as it relates to you. ","1443657979"

See where it goes. Have a script, a plan, but don't read off of it like a teleprompter. Be ready to move things around, change conflicts, get messy, make mistakes!

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","You're right, the video doesn't offer alternatives, but I think its implicit in the discussion (because we need to eat). The question becomes moot when the only other alternative nourishment is comparably immoral. So if we are left with two immoral choices, this discussion becomes pointless as everyone is going to choose food over not-food.

Yes the natural argument always irked me and it is slippery. It may be natural for me to smash someone's head in with a rock if they steal my food, but that's what makes us human - I can choose to ignore that natural impulse due to its immorality. So yes, natural ≠ moral, and its troublesome to employ it in ethical debates.

I agree we need to minimize suffering as much as possible, so we do need to keep this debate going in general. Yeah meat has become too much of a staple protein in western diet. My SO and I have been mocked at work for our vegetarian meals. I'm not a vegetarian, but I do enjoy it and feel like everyone can benefit from switching up their proteins, and it frustrates me when people tell me they NEED meat for every single meal of the day.","1443657981"

There was a little bit of fallout from the glitter, so I made sure to heavily apply a translucent powder under my eyes and on top of my cheeks to catch the fallout so I could just use a larger powder brush to dust it off without smearing it everywhere. I used my same ring finger to blend it onto the crease, then I blended the edges out a little with the light brown shadow from the Lorac Pro 2 palette.

"custommagic","t5_2sbcz","I've had the idea for a planeswalker that permanently became a creature (while not getting rid of the planeswalker card type) for a little while now. Here is a card that captures that idea. Don't mind the art -- I was just browsing around for art featuring merfolk and I stumbled across this piece, and I *had* to make a card with it.

A few notes:

* The ""ultimate"" uses a bulleted list to denote the longer abilities that Ruia gains when she becomes a creature. I like the changes that Wizards made to modal spells and abilities, as it helps readability a lot, and I thought I'd use that formatting here.
* The ""ultimate"" technically doesn't work as worded. In actuality, Ruia would be a planeswalker creature with the Merfolk creature type but without a planeswalker type. However, ""Ruia, Dazzling Charm becomes a Ruia Merfolk planeswalker creature"" sounds really awkward, so I didn't put it in. For purposes of this card, assume that the reminder text actually functions.
* The loyalty cost of the ""ultimate"" was initially \\-7/, but I realized that that would cause Ruia to start as a 1/1 if the ""ultimate"" were used as soon as possible, so I made it a [0] ability instead. I'm not sure if that was the right decision.","1443657990"

I pray that he's wrong about that, and I was wondering just today whether or not this region is already being annexed into China and other states. I personally think of this region not as an abberation, not an exception to the rule of statecraft and domination, but more of a bubble, a pocket in which people may maintain a life similar to what used to cover the Earth in ages past, and I don't know if it's doomed or not, but to me, this seems like the ZAD to end all ZADs.

It's currently over 91% funded, has around 200 million in unfunded liability,  3.9 Billion in assets,  a 1yr return of 17.8%, 3yr of 10.30%, 10yr of 9.68%, and 16yr of 10.79%.   All projections are  based on a 8.5% return.




**Some background:**


The City of Houston does have a budget issue and has increased spending over the years on various items.  Some of this is due to the increases of the cost of service, some of the increase spending on pet projects of the Mayor and City Council, and some is on failed projects which just seem to require more and more money.  
The City of Houston has two main sources of revenue.     The largest is Property Tax (49%) which is followed by Sales Tax (31%).  Franchise Fees  and other items make up the rest of the revenue. 

**Budget Cap**

In 2004 Mayor White help get Proposition 1 passed.   Proposition 1 limits the growth of City’s property tax revenue to the lesser of population and inflation growth or 4.5% growth.     The growth in the city has outpaced the 4.5% and Fiscal Year 2015 was the first time the Proposition 1 would possibly take effect.   It is estimated that next year 's projected revenues will be higher than what the cap allows.  This means the city will have to cut taxes to ensure they do not take in more than is allowed.   The budget cap is calculated every year. 


In 2006 Proposition H was placed on the ballot and passed.  It allows City officials to raise an additional $90 million of revenues above the limit level for public safety.  This includes Police, Fire, Houston Emergency Center (HEC),  and Municipal Courts.

**Pensions**

I'll mention the pensions as simply and quickly as I can. 
The city of Houston has three Pension plans.   

* Houston Municipal Employee Pension System (HMEPS)
* Houston Police Officers Pension System (HPOPS)
* Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRRF)

In the early 2000's there were benefit increases in all three pensions.   Municipal and Police received the largest increase.  In fact the Police Pension benefits were based on highest pay in two week period.   This is called “benefit spiking” and is not sustainable.   It was common for police employees to work almost every day during their last 2 weeks to achieve a extremely high final paycheck.    Municipal employees increased their benefits to the point where the city was paying almost 53% of payroll to the pension.   This means if a person makes $50,000 the city would pay $26,500 to their pension.    Municipal Employees received a  90% pension after 25 yrs of working.   These employees only paid 4% a year into their fund.  

The firefighters saw some increases to their benefits but nowhere near what the other two received.    The firefighters also went  with little to no pay raises during the 1980's, 1990's, and up to 2004.  The pension increases in 2001 where basically instead of  a raise.   Many firefighters who retired before 2000 lived below the poverty line.    Firefighters are not eligible for social security therefore the city nor firefighters pay social security taxes. 


From  2004 - 2010 the City of Houston issued $608 Million in Pension Obligation Bonds.   $482 million went to  Municipal employees pension and $123 million to Police pension.   The Firefighter's Pension did not require bonds to be issued. 

After the large increase for the Police and Municipal employees the City of Houston obtained ""Local control"" of these pensions.   This has not helped.     With local control the  Police and Municipal Pensions funding gap  has increased.   This funding gap is due in large part to the fact that the city hasn’t been paying enough into the pension fund on an annual basis.   They reduce payments one year and promise to make it up down the line however this often does not happen.

The three Pensions systems combined have a funding shortfall of about 3.1 Billion.  
 
* Municipal Employee Pension System  1.8 billion unfunded liability.  Less than 60% funded
* Houston Police Officers Pension System  ~ 1.1 billion unfunded liability.  About 80% funded
* Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund ~ 200 million unfunded liability .  Over 91% funded

One should note while it would great to be 100% funded.  Standard &amp; Poor's rates a pension as ""Strong"" if it's above 90% funded.   Not every employee can retire at once.   The goal should always be 100% funded however above 90% and it's going in the right direction. 

 The City of Houston has ""local control"" over  Municipal and Police pension meaning they negotiated with the Police and Municipal employees every contract.   The Firefighters' is governed by state law and overseen by a Board of Directors in Houston.  The City of Houston has two members on this board.  The Firefighter's Union **does not** deal with the pension.   



**Other Debit**

The City of Houston has around 17.5 Billion in total debt.    Pensions are about 3.1 Billion of this.

**Tax Increment Reinvestment Zones (TIRZ)**

These are a mess and hard to explain.  

We have 25 TIRZ in Houston.

Basically once an area becomes a TIRZ the property tax values within the zone's boundaries are frozen at amount apprised the first year.  This is called the ""Base Year Taxable Value"".   After that any additional increases in property tax revenues is given to the TIRZ to spend within the zone and not the City's General fund. 
The pool of TIRZ money and management-district commercial-property tax revenue is never deposited into the city’s general fund, which is dedicated to police departments and fire Department,  city services and most of the day to day budget. 

An example is TIRZ 16 also known as the uptown Park TIRZ.    It was formed in 1999 and it's tax base was about 1.9 Billion.   Today the tax base is just under 6 Billion.

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","I'm going to say that yes, the fandom has had a huge impact, but not for the reason you might expect. Historically, Hasbro's cartoons have kinda been just long commercials for their toys, with their audience being primarily fans of the toys and wanting to watch a show featuring them. Now, they have a toy line + cartoon where a not-insignificant portion of the audience is there for the cartoon, and buys toys because they are in the show.

If your audience is mainly there for the toys then you can get away with a mediocre (or worse) cartoon as long as the toys are of good quality, but if the audience is there for the cartoon then you better make sure it stays on the air and stays *good*, or else you'll lose out on toy sales. I think it's almost assured that Hasbro has spent *way* more money on FIM's production than any other cartoon they've ever made at this point, because if it goes belly up, they lose out on our sweet sweet disposable income.","1443657997"

In a situation like that the probability that a) it's not her medication and b) it will cause a negative reaction is a lot smaller than the probability that a) she'll continue to have a bad reaction without the medicine. Policy has to be made with such things in mind. It seems to me that the policymakers, as well as you and some other people in this thread, are making the mistake of assuming that the most provocative scenario is as likely as the one that's already happening. 

To me, worrying that a kid might take the wrong medication while they're lying on the floor gasping for air (not what happened in this situation, but it's clear that this is what the policy says should happen) is like worrying that CPR will give the patient heart problems.

It makes people bottle up those sentiments and express them behind closed doors, it doesn't go away. Not to mention the reverse of blacks thinking they cannot be reverse racist, not all obviously, but you get my point.

I see the attempt to control language as something very dangerous and damaging. I'm also sick of minorities constantly bringing up atrocities done to their people through history. We get it, it was fucking disgusting, but I never owned a slave. I haven't carried out genocides etc.

They keep telling people to leave racism in the past, yet they are the ones continuously bringing it up. ""The white man this, the white man that..."" They are the ones forcing people into the tribal camps of race and creed. Do they think I'll sympathize with them, when they call me white ghost, or cracker, or honky or any other retarded shite? No, I'll gravitate to people with a similar cultural and national pride.

I honestly could care less about the colour of someones skin. I care about if they'll follow the law of the land, not rape the minute they see a white defenseless woman. If they'll try to impose their lifestyle, their ideology. If they'll actually go home when safe to do so.

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","I feel that muggle-born wizards, like Hermione grew up using Muggle tech, would be more driven to understand technology. 

From there, it's a bootstrapping process as people like Arthur Weasley and others start learning the basics of Muggle tech and start improving upon it (like the flying car, you could probably make it use magical energy instead of fuel, and get it working reliably) and pass their knowledge on, and if enough people go in the right direction, over time wizards might overlap with the muggle world more. 

Maybe in a decade or two someone will figure out how to generate magical interference fields at will, and disrupt electromagnetic communications, knocking out radio for the muggle troops.

I feel like magic is similar to programming computers, i.e. you link together several small component spells and bind them so that they can be called by a specific phrase whenever you want to use them. For example, Accio might be a combination of wind-calling spells paired with a modified bludger AI (which was invented a long time ago, but seems to work well for finding people) that can bring the object you want into your hand. Sectumsempra could use summoned knives that vanish automatically after the attack. ","1443658001"
"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","This is a great post.  That said, I don't completely agree with your conclusion or the weight you give to certain aspects of the different systems, and I still think rage is a bandaid of sorts.  

The simplest way to put it, is I dislike the idea of a passive system that only affects chaser burst speed without addressing free capper speed.  I would prefer a system which balances both in a way where the player must make choices that have pros and cons.

RANT:
Capping right now is very vanilla.  It is entirely about choosing speed above anything else, and pretty much every route incorporates regen, grabs at full health, and is completely unchaseable (even to someone with rage/lw) unless you are essentially stopped on the stand or make a mistake.  Stand design and rock bouncing play a role as well, but free speed is the main issue.  It would be a much more interesting game if someone had to choose between being fast and losing health and/or losing opportunities to grab due to long setup times OR chose to grab slower with more health and a faster setup OR somewhere in between.  There would still be unchaseable routes, but they would not be EVERY route and would come at a cost.","1443658001"

"Metal","t5_2qhud","W.A.S.P. [Still Not Black Enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjMBjRG1oSg)

W.A.S.P., if it's remembered at all, is mostly only remembered for their first three albums, which are classics of the 80s glam metal/butt rock genre. Which is a crying shame, as some of W.A.S.P.'s best albums came out in the 90s! This album is pretty much a bunch of songs that didn't make it onto the Crimson Idol record plus a couple of covers, and it *kicks insane amounts of ass*. 

Unusually for W.A.S.P., the album has two ballads, and wow, they are both incredibly tender and beautiful. ""Breathe"" is a straight love song, but ""Keep Holding On"" is more poignant. ""Will I have your memory?/Or will your memory have me?"" It's so delicate that you're afraid to exhale and somehow damage it's beauty and fragility.

""I Can't"" could almost be a country song, and has a needy, raw emotional vulnerability that one wouldn't expect from W.A.S.P. based on their reputation. Love him or hate him, but Blackie can tap into some kind of dark and emotional, but painfully human, place with his lyrical content that can disturb without relying on shocking, schlocky Satanic imagery or gross-out antics. He would take this even further on the next album, K.F.D., which is a masterpiece if you like industrial metal but if you don't like industrial metal, uh, there ain't much in K.F.D. that's gonna interest you.

""Rock and Roll To Death"" is a rollicking throwback to Chuck Berry-esque rock and roll that is infectiously fun! ""Time to party/Raise a glass/Tell everybody to kiss my ass!"" Also, this motherfucker can sing. Blackie hits notes in the stratosphere and doesn't even sound like he's trying that hard. But completely putting aside his power and vocal abilities, Blackie has an ability to *make you believe in what he's singing*. He is so sincere that it's excruciating. Going on a bit of a tangent, but I've never heard anyone cover W.A.S.P. and come anywhere close to the original, and that's because no one has Blackie's conviction. When Nightwish covers ""Wild Child"" it falls flat, because no matter how handsome Marco Hietala is, there is no way I'm gonna buy that he's some demon-lover who's going to ravish me and lure me away from my faithful lover. When Blackie sings ""Wild Child"", he makes me believe that he's an incubus who could ruin you for any lover after him. Sometimes this utter conviction can be unintentionally hilarious, as Blackie can sing about his love for Jesus and his love for bondage-sex with equal verve and sincerity, and sometimes you're halfway through a song (such as ""Take Me Up"") before you figure out which he's singing about.","1443658004"

This might be a stretch, but I also get the sense that the deep blue left side phasing into white is a nod to Scarborough being the city's Easternmost area.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Read ""CES Letter"" (google it).  The Church purposely obfuscates the facts regarding it's foundation.  Fact: Joseph Smith claimed to see God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ in a vision.  Christ told him “..all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt;”  However, of the 4 documented versions of the first vision, this is the one the Church claims as the ""Official Version.""  Other versions show just God or just angles etc.  Not much cohesion between them.  Joseph was also told to ""Join non of them, for they are all wrong.""  As soon as the vision is over he joins up with the Methodists.  So, did he actually disobey God?! or is this just 1 of many versions of the first vision that finally stuck and sounded good.

He sees many benefits and multiple problems, but there is no ultimate overarching standard in his analysis. So, he really does not have a specific end in mind, except that nations should work to ensure a smooth transition into democracy and be prepared to deal with some of its problems.

I'm usually either super confident when I'm playing (and winning) or super tilted/frustrated when I'm losing. The problem is that it's hard to know which it'll be when I sit down to play. I've gone to plat I back down to plat III about 10000 times this season, and it's always in streaks of wins or losses. I think the key is probably to not play much when you can feel you're tilted, but that's much easier said than done when you have a very limited amount of time when you can play like I do. 

As for tips on improving, I can't say anything for sure without watching you play, but your CS numbers are pretty bad, especially when you play ADC. If you can consistently get 8 cs per minute, then you'll probably skyrocket in rank.

Instead, you will have pockets of Pakistan clustered around the new mosques.  Islam is the dominant ideology in play here and your secular values will be discarded before the new arrivals loose their head scarfs.  You might have had a chance when government enforced Christianity or Atheism, just as the Islamic ideology is enforced in all of the middle east Islamic Republics.  There is zero chance of a cultural conversion of Islam to any sort of German national secular values.  Instead, the German populace will grow intolerant of jews and other religions as Islam exerts growing influence.  The growing migrant population will reject secular values.  Due to the very low German female reproduction and the rapid rate of Muslim women reproduction, the demographic shift is assured.  The role of a Muslim women is only to have additional children.  The German woman is a client of career, birth control, and family planning.  The growing immigrant population will replace German nationality.  Germany will cease.","1443658011"

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","Oh ok I follow now. Kinda depends really on how reliably a particular dungeon's damage is going to hit you. If it's a bunch of glass cannons then it's really hard to say as it's all about starting ATB RNG. Haste RM is what makes the difference there.  But for more even and drawn out runs or boss rushes I dare say there's no blanket answer. I feel it is more about the frequency that damage will come at you As well as whether it's going to be on single targets or spread out of you across the party and then vs whether or not you can effectively aoe cure the whole party party or not. Then it's all about how much an increase in defense of resistance compares to the current amount on a character 4 hit points added vs the  maximum HP because this game really is all about relativity when regarding potency of any gear stat boost is static and character stats vary widely between each other or themselves over levels as well as what gear you have pulled. Problem is that in this game it just can't be put into numbers very well but consider this most important yet overlooked factor:

Def/res trumps hp 99% of cases since protectaga / shellaga / SG is a cornerstone in this game even a 10 point increase accessory will become 20 or 30 or more even. But there's not an equivalent ability for hp","1443658012"

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","Okay, my style is heavily on the bruiser/assassin side of the coin. I really don't even really try being a tank. Even in QM. Her damage can be frightening, and with a little self sustain she's got the wonderful benefit of never having to worry about mana.

1.) I pretty much go with War Paint unless there is a very specific threat that I should take block for like Raynor or Nova. War Paint can help with health to a point where I only rarely need to go to a healing fountain.

4/7. I'll explain these as one. Focused Attack/Follow Through. She's got a rather respectable attack speed and on the attacks where both proc it can be about equal to the damage of her Slam. And really, if you happen to come in with a store of fury, finding a squishy, you can actually keep slamming get it on every attack. In actual team fights or a duel you're going to want to manage your Fury by going Slam -&gt; AA -&gt; AA -&gt; Slam, putting in the spear when you need extra fury.

10.) Wrath of the Berserker. Smart playing can keep the damage boost up damn near forever. Seriously, I routinely come out of it with less than 3 seconds on the cooldown, if it is still even there. The CC reduction is greatly helpful too. Great talent, 10/10

13.) The practicality of Mystic Spear is too damn high to lose the utility, unless you're being absolutely wrecked by a mage and need Spell Shield.

16.) Now for this level I used to go Nerves of Steel every time, but now it's only if I've been focused a lot. One of Sonya's big difficulties is not being able to stick as well she needs to really secure the kills. For this purpose No Escape answers the call like no other. I find myself chanting this as I pop people.

20.) Okay, here I am pretty consistent in grabbing her Hardened Shield analogue, whatever it's called. I mean, yeah building all about kills is fun, but at some point staying alive is nice.","1443658015"

- Zombie Dice
- Fluxx 
- Love Letter
- Escape: Curse of the Temple! (Warning this was really loud so we stopped - damn dice!)
- The Resistance Avalon (Also loud but we literally played over 150+ games of this)
- Coup
- King of Tokyo (We found this better played with 4 so we don't play it as much - and dice are loud)
- Cosmic Encounter (Although most of the time this game gets split over two lunch times. I created a custom foamcore insert with dividers so we can store peoples hands and we also all take photos of our home systems so we can set it up the next day).
- Bang! The Dice Game
- Mascarade 

The three most popular games (ones we have played the most) have been Coup, Avalon and Cosmic Encounter (SUCH a good game!).

Some other games I've been thinking:

- Sushi Go

- Tsuoro

- Citadels

- Libertalia

also, i just looked at the checkbooks and her name is on those as well, right under mine. so i'm guessing you're right about the joint account thing. but i'm the only one with a debit card, and it only had my name on it.

ugh, this is so frustrating. I guess i will just open up a new account. are there any drawbacks to that? like will i end up losing money doing this? and will i be able to close the other bank account without her being there?

p.s. as far as attacking enemy fleets in the ports, while this would apply to the late game, gally warfare did not work that way,

galley warfare if very poorly represented in game.
what it mostly consisted of was gaining a hard point on the shore near a port you want to blockade,

you then fortify that point with cannons, and any time you see a ship leaving port you would get in the galley try and sink it and return to your fort.

you did not attack the port for the same reason the town did not attack your fort, cannon.
there were almost no galleys with cannon because they relied on speed and muscle power.
so the cannon they did bring are deploy on the land.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

My parents NEVER swore around the kids. I got grounded for 2 weeks because I said ""Frick"" at one point as a 15 year old. We all learn it somewhere at some point.

"fatpeoplestories","t5_2vzax","&gt; some medications can actually slow metabolism

Anything that slows your metabolism by a significant amount will kill you. Metabolism is the body keeping itself alive by breathing, cell division, etc. Human metabolic rate just doesn't vary that much, because it can't.

From your link:

&gt;The researchers found that the primary cause of weight gain was increased caloric intake, 

Right.

&gt;though the study also showed that Zyprexa affected the patient’s resting energy expenditure and slowed their metabolism.

One drug, and it doesn't say how big an effect it was.

&gt;Many antipsychotics, including Zyprexa, and some antidepressants, block activity at a kind of neurotransmitter receptor called 5-HT2C, which has been shown to be a trigger for eating behavior and obesity in mice.

Eating behaviour.

&gt;Other drugs may act on other kinds of receptors involved in weight gain, such as the beta-3 adrenergic receptors in fat tissue. The beta-3 receptors play a role in converting fat into energy, 

Might be suggesting that these drugs prevent fat being mobilised to produce energy when blood sugar is low? I.e. making weight loss harder? If so, that's a good point and one I hadn't considered. At what point does ""difficulty losing weight"" equate to ""made me gain weight""? If you can't turn fat into energy, you'd need to regulate intake very very carefully to avoid adding a little bit every time you eat anything.

On the other hand, if this drug prevented fat burning, then the body would burn muscle tissue instead, until it couldn't anymore, and then it would die.","1443658029"

Reading this made me realize how terrified I am to trust someone. I read ""When you have trust in someone..."" and I thought, *But what if they leave?!* I had a very strong emotional reaction to that sentence. That was really interesting.

&gt;It sounds like you're upset because you thought he was going to work on a project, and now he's not, and he didn't talk to you about it.

Mostly correct. The additional aspect of my issue is that I've been putting a lot of time and energy into this project, as well, because it sucks up so much of his focus, and I want to help him be less stressed. We don't go out because he has so much work to do, he can't go do x fun thing because he has so much work to do- but the second this friend comes along and says, ""Let's go backpacking,"" he's in.

Anyway, I think I've been putting in more time/energy on his project than I should. If I overexert myself, I'll start to resent him for it. I need to back off.

But I will talk to him about it, and try to do it in a non-confrontational way. And I'll talk to him about truly open communication.","1443658034"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","It's not stupid to get hurt over this woman claiming a name that's suspiciously close to 'mama.' Your feelings are always valid, it's what you do as a result of them that can get you judged. Her creepy behavior is triggering your instincts. 

  Her behavior is very dismissive of you as your baby's mother and extremely possessive of your baby. I'm honestly surprised you spend any time with her. It sounds like you're just the incubator and she's the mommy in her head. She is going to fight you on any decision you make and try to rob you of authority. (""Mommy is mean for not letting you have sweets, with mimi you will get all the candies/stay up late/have all the toys."")

  Other than her total disregard of you, my major worry is all the pressure she'll be putting on your baby as he gets older. She already treats him like baby Prozac and snatches him up every chance she gets. What kind of effect is this going to have on your child? If he says 'no' to anything she wants she is going to tear up and manipulate him and make him *feel bad for expressing himself* and ""hurting mimi."" Little kids can't take the pressure of being responsible for someone else's feelings like that. Hell, *adults* can't take that responsible and stay mentally healthy. It's too taxing and it's emotional abuse. This has the potential to groom your child into the perfect victim for any abuser to later swoop in and take advantage.

 I highly recommend lurking on DWIL (Dealing With In-Laws board on babycenter) and AITF (All In The Family also on babycenter - it's like DWIL but slower paced) to get an idea of what boundaries you need and how this will affect your kids in the future if it goes unchecked. ","1443658039"

I would learn how to actually produce with the stock plugins first and once you feel you've gotten to a point where you're happy with the results, you can look into pro-level plugins like Waves if you feel you still need them.

It's a shame you feel like you can't speak to your girlfriend. Maybe she doesn't fully understand your feelings - writing down may help her understand? 

You should talk to your friends too, I'm sure they won't resent you. If they are true friends they will help and support you as much as they can. Could you give it a try with at least one of them?

Honestly it worries me that you said you have been punching yourself like that. Nobody should feel the need to do that. I admit, I've self harmed before and it's a horrible thing to go through, so I really sympathise with you. 

You are right that seeing someone would help you - and it's very hard to face. But please give it another try. It's difficult, I know - but it could make you feel so much better in the long run. I went for ages without seeing anyone, but I finally got the courage to see a doctor who gave me antidepressants and sent me to a counsellor. This really helped me. 

Another thing I would like to ask is, are your parents around? I'm sure they would be supportive if you were to speak to them.

I shaved off 500 calories/day of food over what my app recommended.
I walk to every class, every day. 
Days I know I'm going out drinking I eat 800-1000 calories less than days I don't go drinking. 
I don't count exercise calories, but I do exercise at least 6 days a week. 

I take a multivitamin and eat almost entirely protein to compensate for the nutrition lost from food.

* If you're in a city, look up its animal control ordinance.  If there isn't one, use the county's.  Finally, fall back onto state law.  Do your research first before contacting the appropriate authority (local/county ... state won't usually get involved unless it's a **VERY** serious issue.)  

* Contact your neighbor with your concerns.  Mention minimum leash/tether lengths (if required), minimum shelter requirements, minimum food/water requirements.   By all means, offer the 20 foot leash.  If Georgia is a ""one party state"", record the conversation.  (One party state = only one person has to know if the conversation is being recorded.  Smart phones in your shirt pocket can easily record this)

* Documentation ... documentation ... documentation.  If you can't get the neighbor to comply, document everything with photographic evidence.  You can legally take pictures of that animal over your fence as it's in plain sight.

Basically what you're doing is gift-wrapping a case for the police/sheriff/DA.  

Have fun, and I hope your neighbor decides to comply.

If all else fails, contact the local chapter of the ASPCA.  Don't get me wrong, I love what they do, but I hate having to work with them because of the high publicity factor they bring in.

So ... start off with pictures of the current situation.  Document your attempts to help the neighbor comply.  Back up with more pictures over a week's time.  Contact local authorities.  Make sure you're complying with all laws to make sure all evidence is admissible.","1443658045"

"RSDarkscape","t5_39we1","Range attack and range strength would work the same was as melee attack and melee strength.

The ""attack"" skill will dictate what new weapons you can wear and affect your accuracy, and the ""strength"" skill would affect your damage output plus some special cases (like granite maul, obby maul etc.)

Same thing would apply to magic. One gives you access to spells, one determines how hard you can hit with them.

In terms of how would they introduce it to the game, there's a few ways to do it. For example, let's say you have 70 range which is about 700k ranged xp.

When you log in, you'll receive your ranged xp + 10% (so 770k) in the form of a lamp. You can then distribute that experience in any way you wish between ""ranged attack"" and ""ranged strength"", so you could choose to turn that xp into 64 range attack (~360k range attack xp) and 65 range strength (~410k range strength xp).

Yes, but based upon history rather than random guessing.

Because freedom of speech is pretty much the top of an umbrella, removing freedom of speech is the gateway to remove all else, and if all else has been taken free speech is a means to get it back. If you cut off freedom of association but retain freedom of speech then you can argue against the government cut of association, and inform of the public. But if you cut off freedom of speech but not association what does that right matter anyway? Once you are in that group what next? Cutting off freedom of speech is the key to cutting everything else off, once that is gone you can make any change you want and no one can argue it. That's why I call it an Achilles heel. It is a countries one true weakness throughout time.","1443658048"

The reason is that your average working American doesn't *understand* what tax policy would work best. 

I am completely ignorant about the details of financial policy in this country. Since I cannot examine a government policy itself, I have to trust those who put it forward. If I was asked to approve a financial policy that ***would affect the entire nation,*** I would trust a policy from Hillary Clinton over one from Donald Trump. 

If that makes me a rube-moron-average-voter-idiot, then so be it. Add me to the throngs of people who would trust a plan from Hillary Clinton but would reject the same plan from Donald Trump. It's not the *policy* they're approving or rejecting, it's the *person.*

"starbound","t5_2tkp6","But I mean the future features list you see in that link make several mentions about changes to monsters. 

- Implement the unique monster community contest winner Poptop
- Huge Monsters will be finished and added to the game.
- When you capture a monster, that monster goes to your ship where you can go equip the pet in one of your pet slots in your inventory window. 

&gt; ""We're going to expand on creature capture massively in a future patch. I really want collecting interesting and unique monsters to be a huge part of the game.""

- The player may get to ""bio-engineer"" a monster together from chosen parts. Probably after 1.0.
- Improved Monster generation mechanics, such as wall-crawlers.

Granted none of these are absolutely promised, and I also imagine there are changes we simply wont know will come; but just shows they are working on them.

I mean someone made mention to Terraria and I think that's a fair thing to bring up. Because when you think about it, what's so hard about Terraria? Frankly it's not complex AI. There's nothing mind blowing about a huge wave of monsters or things shooting projectiles floating around you. It's just well balanced high numbers.

It was surprisingly easy and quick to teach them, considering they despise baths (especially my Shiba!). I started with putting them in the dry tub and having them sit. ""Good boy! Bath Time!"" and treat. This progressed to sitting outside of the tub with ""Bath time!"" and signaling them to jump in and sit. I had a head start since the already know that a snap and point = ""go to/get up/get down there"". I slowly moved this command farther and farther from the actual tub, that I can be in a strangers house and tell them ""bath time"" and they run around looking for a tub. It's super cute and really, really handy when it's actually time for a bath. ","1443658055"

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;So if Hitler only exterminated jews who had harmed innocent people, it would be ok? So who decides what ""harm"" is, and what ""innocent"" is?

That is a false equivalence... 

Capital punishment in the United States is given nearly exclusively currently to those who are convicted by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt of taking the life of another person on purpose. My problem has never been that they kill murderers, but that dispensing an absolute final judgement in a criminal justice system that is inherently not absolute in its accuracy, in some states using drugs that aren't even legal, creates a situation where innocent people may be executed and/or subject to extreme pain from botched executions, and therefore poses a risk to individual liberty and the integrity of the rule of law.

"Eve","t5_2qil9","I think I discovered EVE in the same way many people did: hearing some of the crazy stories that sometimes leaked out into more mainstream media.  Created a trial account, but never actually subbed.  Tried again in 2011, and from then on, I was hooked.

There was one time, a couple years after I started playing, one of the newer players in chat.E-uni piped up asking about something he had never seen before; a miner who was using a barge and had an unpiloted orca beside him.  *Ghost riding.*  I explained the principal behind it, how the orca was essentially a giant secure jetcan, and then asked where this miner was.

And so, I made the trek from Jita out into minmatar space with a couple of my alts.

A couple days later, I noticed the pilot was online.  Jumped over to the system mentioned by that E-uni pilot, and found a small mining fleet of 6 hulks, the orca I intended to steal, and an obelisk.  Of course, a big shiny ship I don't have the skills to fly.  Off to Hek my alt goes to get a skillbook and burn some of those pretty unallocated skillpoints he had from some refund or another.

So, that was taken care of, but the bigger issue was actually getting the ships.  After doing a little math, I figured out I had a roughly 18% chance of successfully ECMing all the hulks with a single suicide blackbird.  Unacceptable.   I didn't have any backup to call, I had just come back from a hiatus, and everyone I felt I could trust was either gone or somewhere in c5 space.  The solution was a suicide lachesis.  I know, suiciding a t2 ship isn't a great idea, but I needed that sixth mid slot.

So I fitted the thing up and got all my characters into position.  Get away drivers in covops a couple KM off the target ships, main character waiting on the gate.

Deep breath.  *It's go time.*  Jump the gate, warp to bookmark.  Ctrl + click, click, click, click, click, click.  Lock.  Lock, lock, lock wait for it, lock, lock.  Everything's lock, turn on the damps.  Make sure to spread them, if you fuck up now, that's it.  Damps are up, ignore the lachesis for now.  Gotta get into the orca and the obelisk.  Right click -&gt; board.  *shield and armour alarms*  Right click -&gt; board.  *hull alarm and explosion*  Warp the main character out, he's got like 300 mil in implants.  Give a wave in local.  Scoop the two covops with the orca.  Warp my main to station, dock.  Ok, we're good.  Warp the orca and obelisk to station, dock, walk away.

I can only guess as to the expressions crossing the face of the former owner of my two newest ships when he discovered what I had done.  I returned to my computer with a convo request sitting in the middle of my screen, and a notification about a new public bounty.  Accepted the convo and explained what I had done, how I did it and how he could avoid it happening in the future.  A few minutes later, that particular killright on me was no longer public.  I suppose people appreciate honesty.

Now that I think about it, I've had a weird relation with my orcas.  I've only ever bought one, the first one I ever owned.  I got one from the aforementioned incident, won one from blink, lost one when I got trapped out rolling a hole and left it in space to go scout, lost another during a system move, an got another from someone who was ghost riding in Perimeter of all systems.

I've spent the majority of my EVE career in wormholes, and I got into them just daytripping with a drake and a salvage dessie.  Things escalated from there until I was triple boxing characters in c5 escalations and floating around in my cloaky proteus.

As for things I'd like to try, I think it's time for something a little more laid back, probably FW.  Speaking of which, if there are any corps recruiting, I'm looking!","1443658059"

Don't say it is being implemented to keep F1 on top, because it isn't. I can not realistically see WEC being able to catch up to F1 levels of speed (technically they have caught Manor, who is racing a year old car that was already in the back that year).

Wouldn't it be better to not have debt in the first place? (Of course they check if you do have a credit entry here too, but not many people have)

OK, yeah I understand that. 

&gt;Also cars are necessary for students because most of the country doesn't have a train or subway system. You need a car to get anywhere. 

Yeah most of my friends also have cars, but they saved up for them. you don't need to pay for a car with a loan if you're patient and somewhat disciplined.

No I meant debt other than that. You're right, that was worded wrong by me. 

&gt;Do people in Germany commonly have their mortgages completely paid off when they die? Only 1/3rd of American homeowners actually ""owns"" their house, as in the bank doesn't own it through the mortgage 

Well to use my mom as an example again, she hasn't paid back it all of yet, but unless she dies very soon, she'll own the house. The bank negotiates a repayment plan with you for like 15, 20, 30, years. They're unlikely to grant you the loan if you won't see the end of it. 

&gt;But are you telling me you never have some emergency cost you can't afford?

Well I can't imagine any. Health is on the government, education is too, if I break someone's stuff I have insurance for that, cars have to be insured anyway... can't think of anything. 

&gt;Or your budget just comes up short this month and you have to pay rent somehow?

Don't you have ""backup money"" for these things? I'd never spend all my money at a time and have 0 left (I'm not dirt poor, as in bottom 10%, if I were I'd maybe be in that situation). So if I spend 200 more this month and 200 less next month my backup account (a few thousand bucks) smoothes that out. I guess it's another cultural thing, you are expected to never spend all your money here. 

&gt;I find it hard to believe *anyone* who has a credit card isn't in at least *some* debt. I mean why would banks offer them otherwise if they can't profit off the interest?

Yeah that would be aforementioned uneducated people whose lifes get exposed on daytime TV. There's also a monthly fee for most people and it's a service from the bank. And just like with PayPal whoever receives the money has to pay a fee for every transaction.

Not having the most powerful and expensive graphic cards and ram also keep the cost low for this future proof pc, which is what you the customer want for your prebuilt no hassle pc, and if it's not entirely what you want, you can also just buy more ram/video cards on your budget.

"Enneagram","t5_2sdjj","I can definitely be satisfied, it's all a matter of perspective for me. I can be fully satisfied with something considering the circumstances, that doesn't mean I'm satisfied with staying at that level, I want to improve.

I'll give you two examples that might help explain it better:

We've been recording some songs with my band, and I'm fully satisfied with the way they turned out. Considering the fact that we did all of the recording on our own, with cheap gear and without really knowing what the fuck we were doing, it turned out way above expected. There are lots of things about the recordings that I'm not satisfied with, for a starter my own playing is nowhere near good enough, but the product we got I'm really freaking satisfied with considering the circumstances.

A contrasting example would be our last live performance, I haven't heard one single bad word from the audience, we've only gotten ""praise"", yet I'm not even remotely satisfied. It was an okay gig, I'm not disappointed either, it was fine, but I'm definitely not satisfied. There were way too many unnecessary fuck-ups, way too little stage show so on and so forth. I don't think we delivered anywhere near what we could have, so I'm nowhere near satisfied. All the good feedback from the audience means nothing to me, it just feels disingenuous to me because it simply wasn't good enough.

&gt; why can't you temper it a bit, or at least mentally check yourself

It isn't rational, I can't rationalize it. It's like a phobia, it doesn't matter how much you know that it's irrational, the emotional response is the same. It's not something you can just snap your fingers and change. I can't really explain it either since it isn't realistic or rational, I can't grasp it or understand it myself.

They're not effective because with some experience they become a lot more obvious to defend. Unless the person on top has an entire game developed on choking someone while they're in someone's guard, you really shouldn't be falling for chokes while you have someone in your guard.

As far as someone grabbing the belt, why does it matter if they're in your closed guard (I'm assuming they're grabbing the belt in front of you)? There's no real attack they can go for with the belt grab as far as I know. The grip just helps them maintain posture, but the most important part in that is the fact their elbows are inside your thighs, and prying open your guard, not the fact they have a grip on your belt. That means you should be looking for way to pop their elbows out so you can compromise their posture, not looking to break their grip on your belt.","1443658066"

A mother doesn't want an old pushy person for her daughter, she wants what's best for her. This isn't to say she is entirely over protective either, she did give her honest first impression of the man, asking the daughter if she wanted to see him. This may not be a one-and-done deal either, perhaps one day someone does come along and the first impression is great, then after a while it doesn't seem like he's Mr. Right anymore, the Dragon will more than likely return.","1443658068"

like its pretty obvious he started on the left side then worked his way to the right side- which like if it was just fan art it'd be like 'whatever' but this is permanent marking on your body so...
pretty much he fucked up the entire angle of the face 

it looks like this might have been the art you tried to use as a reference,http://www.metalgearsolid.be/images/breve-artwork-yoji-shinkawa-big-boss-mgsv-ground-zeroes-140903-s.jpg
but the differences you made to the art make it look so derpy ,the face got elongated  and rounded in a way to make his face look fat and wide

i mean anyone can just do a side by side comparison i think the biggest problem is the way the artist tried to warp the angle 

his face in the art is more angular, smaller- i dunno you might not care, but if it was a permanent marking on my body i definitely would care","1443658068"

This takes forward thnking and delayed gratification so its rare in females. aka unicorn. 

Thus rather than wasting your peak time on post wall women who didnt give you the time of the day when they were in their peak, ignore the post wall scum and harvest the young selfish CC females.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","True that. I spent a few months sleeping over a broken water heater once. It wasn't able to vent and the floorboards had little cracks in them due to foundation issues so my bedroom was basically the flue. I was also eating a bunch of food that I got on sale without knowing it was recalled until after the situation played out, and was getting either e.coli or salmonella at the same time as a result (can't remember which as everything was hazy back then). Kept trying to tell people something was off with me, but everyone thought I was just being lazy, and I didn't do much about it because I'm stubborn and figured if I was sick that I'd just push through like I always do. Apparently I started acting a bit more irrational than is usual for me with head/sinus infections, and people started to catch on that something was up. Even that dragged things out though as every few days someone would drop by to try a new carbon monoxide detector, but it would always turn out to be 'defective' and screech incessantly the second it was turned on. Took a while before anyone went ""Oh, it's just really that bad in there"". I moved into my parents garage that winter and started recovering. For the first few months I was basically retarded, but my head cleared up after the summer.

Fortunately it made me feel to lazy to want to shower too often, or I might have increased demand on the water heater and died. So that's a weird sort of optimization equation when you think about it.

"nyjets","t5_2s2av","There are COUNTLESS articles from reporters, former Jets, and locker room talk that speak about how Geno is not a leader and doesn't have support of the team. He had a childish off season that ended up with a non football related injury. Not a single person stood up for him or Ik, which tells you a lot about the kind of person he probably is.  

And no, he doesn't have a ""nice deep ball."" Where the hell did you see/read that? He struggle with the deep ball in college and he struggled with the deep ball on the Jets. What have you been watching?

Fitz is not a mess. He may not make the fastest decisions and best throws, but he knows what he's doing out there. He has full command of the offense. He meshes well with the team. Just take a quick tour of the past few weeks of this sub and you will see countless pics of him and teammates hanging out. That may seem like nothing, but it's important. 

Our offensive line plays better with him behind it, and I don't think that's an accident. He's a veteran of the Chan Gailey system, and he is a veteran QB. There's a big difference between a QB knowing his assignment (Geno), and a QB that knows EVERYONE's assignment (Fitzy).  

I'd rather not throw our season away ""testing"" a QB who has done nothing to prove he deserves to start.


I watched the film from the Eagles game. What about this game tells you that Geno should start? The Brandon Marshall giveaway? How about when it went right through his hands? Or the tipped interception? Or the interception off rookie Devin Smith? 

Bottom line, there is no reason to ""test Geno Smith"" after a 24-17 loss when we are 2-1. ","1443658071"

They would hang out a lot on the deck after dark though. And she supposed that was all she really could do for now, just be there for him.   
""Ahw shit Nate, now you got me all hyped up. That all sounds very interesting! Maybe we can have that talk when the discussions about Myr are over? There should be some free time about then.   
I'd love to tell you about the free folk. To be honest I think you're the first to ask me about it. I'm sure you already read some in that book of yours though. How much do you know already? About this world anyway?""

Nick Foles has beaten Seattle. 

But if you're sure Cam will be a top 3 candidate for mvp given those circumstances, I'll hold you to that ;) (*Of course, I'll be rooting against the panthers, just like every week, unless you are playing the Saints. Good work, btw) ","1443658072"

You should check in with your utility about free or low cost or subsidized energy upgrades. Better sealing of the house or insulation of the attic could help.  Perhaps a more efficient newer AC unit or heat pump could reduce expenses.  In my state, lower income residents can get some of these things highly subsidized with low payment plans.  This doesn't solve your problem today unless it is free, but it is definitely something to think about.  

Also, I don't want to manage your family planning decisions, but if your plan is for your wife to work and make 40k a year while you go to school, having a baby ASAP does not sound like a good plan.

Consequently, it was hard to answer, as I like anywhere from Medium Rare to Medium, both of which are extremely different in taste and texture.

Every single dictionary I looked at had a secondary definition specifying that jobs did not have to be paid so I googled your exact definition and got the Oxford dictionary. Words have multiple meanings; to understand a word you need to look beyond just the #1 accepted use as all are applicable.

From the Oxford dictionary:

1. A paid position of regular employment
2. A task or piece of work, **especially one that is paid**

See how #2 qualifies that a job is not necessarily *always* paid? From this we can infer that jobs can also be unpaid, that's just an exception to the rule.","1443658085"

Underlying gameplay and RCI concepts and work/happiness/traffic relationships are still as inconsequential as they are in the vanilla game. I was hoping for an improvement in this area.

New tourism and leisure specializations don't really seem to do all that much different.

From a gameplay perspective, tourism management doesn't feel very engaging. Even with it's flaws, SimCity's tourism mechanic was interesting (while oftentimes frustrating, however) to manage.

Overall the game is still fantastic, but I think my expectations were set too high for the expansion. I don't regret buying it, though, and would do it again at the same price. CO does good work.","1443658085"

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","It could be a problem of too much compression. or just too much sound being pushed through. 
another thing I think could be the problem is you have too many frequencies fighting with each other. if you have multiple leads, and all of them are operating in the same frequency range, then they can clash a lot and get a really muddy sound, thus sounding quieter and less defined.","1443658089"
"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Ah cool, no worries dude.

So yep this is how you would have to use it, with respect to my first example:

    Person person = new Person();
    person.SetName(""xx_yy_xx"");
    string name = person.GetName(); // name will be ""xx_yy_xx""

So what I'm saying is that since *_name* is a private variable in the Person class, you have to expose it somehow to access it when you create your object. Without those methods you can only access *_name* from within your class itself.

In general...

 * Getters/Accessors refer to the way you retrieve your private variable (in this case, a method)

 * Settings/Mutators refer to how you assign a value to your private variable (in this case, once again, a method)

 * In C#, we're lucky enough to have things called Properties, which is just an easy way to tell the program to set up a private variable, and and get (and/or) set method for us using the single line in my second example. My second example is the exactly same thing as my first example, except using a Property instead of manually defining the private variable and methods.

So with my second example, here's how you would access it:

    Person person = new Person();
    person.Name = ""xx_yy_xx""; // Set the variable, or...
    string name = person.Name; // Retrieve the variable. Yay, it does all the heavy lifting for us if we use properties!

Does that help at all dude?

"france","t5_2qhjz","Génétiquement, on peut parfaitement séparer les populations. Le problème, c'est que : 1) il n'y a aucune limite entre deux ""races"" différentes, juste des dégradés, les populations se sont juste progressivement éloignées en fonction de la distance entre elles ; et 2) si on essaie de procéder de manière objective et vraiment génétique, en utilisant les haplogroupes, par exemple, on se rend compte que les divisions génétiques n'ont juste absolument rien à voir avec ce qu'on croit. Ainsi, si tu veux une base génétique pour une ""race blanche"" ou européenne, l'haplogroupe paternel R1b, qui est très commun en Europe de l'Ouest et semble nous venir des Indo-Européens - ceux que les nazis appelaient Aryens - inclue également une grande partie du Tchad et du Nigéria, alors qu'il est très rare en Ukraine ou en Finlande. ([voir ici](http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1b_Y-DNA.shtml)) De plus, quand on dit ""très courant"" en Europe de l'ouest, c'est souvent inférieur à 50% de la population, et comme cela ne montre que l'origine en ligne paternelle, le chiffre surestime sûrement *beaucoup* la part de nos gènes qui viennent de ces Indo-Européens. 


A la base de l'idée de ""races"", les gens pensent surtout à l'apparence physique, le phénotype, qui peut varier beaucoup plus ou beaucoup moins que les gènes. Et au final les gens sont aussi sacrément biaisés par la culture. Apparemment si on est musulman (aux yeux bleus comme Assad ou verts comme Zidane?), on est disqualifié d'office de la ""race blanche"", on est ""basané"". Par contre les Juifs d'Afrique du Nord, personne ne doute de leur ""blancheur"", d'ailleurs c'est Zemmour qui vient à la télé pour expliquer qu'il est ""de race blanche"". Aux US c'est un peu pareil avec les Latinos, on n'est pas ""vraiment"" blanc si on est originaire d'un pays qui parle espagnol.


Donc pour conclure, oui, tout ça c'est du grand n'importe quoi. Le concept de race est maintenant discrédité scientifiquement (d'ailleurs mis à part les racistes scientifiques du 19-20e siècles, ça n'a jamais été scientifique, le terme vient de l'élevage, pas de la biologie). Et comme tu le dis l'idée n'a même pas vraiment d'utilité, à part alimenter le racisme.","1443658091"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""are you sure you're ready.""

Adrien looked up from the backpack he was holding. ""Yeah, I'm ready. We've been planning for months, might as well get it started, right?"" She smiled at the woman in front of her, a gruff, older woman in a dirty blue jumpsuit. Here once light-brown hair was graying. Adrien was dressed similarly, her long brown hair pulled back in a messy bun and grey eyes framed by glasses. 

""Alright. Follow me. No words other than as per protocol until we're done."" The older woman turned and started to walk. Adrien followed close behind, the backpack slung over one shoulder. On earth it would have weighed nearly ninety pounds, but here on the moon it was the equivalent of sixteen. 

They walked through a large hangar filled with all sorts of craft; buggies, heavy-duty haulers, sub-orbital ships, and towards the end they were walking towards, the blue and silver ships of the United Earth Navy, some of which dwarfed the civilian vessels now behind them. 

""Identification."" A large man stepped in front of them, dressed in a blue and silver military uniform. His face was hidden by his helmet, and a small but deadly looking rifle hung from a strap on his shoulder. 

The older woman deftly reached into her pocket and produced a piece of paper saying that the two of them were there to help with emergency maintenance on one of the largest craft in the hanger, the UESS Europa. The guard quickly scanned over the paper, then handed it back and prompted them through. 

All around them were men, women, and robots scurrying about among the landing gear of the ships; pilots, ground crew, officers, everyone was walking with purpose. Adrien could recognize the non-Lunans immediately; they were still muscular and didn't have the gaunt, almost skeletal bodies that come from growing up in a low gravity environment. Most had probably only been here a few days, their last stop before they flew off to Mars or Titan.

She hated every single one of them.

After what seemed like an endless walk, passing dozens of craft, they finally arrived at the Europa. It was an imposing vessel, a slightly darker blue than some of the other ships, and it's landing gear alone were over twenty feet high. It had been suffering some electrical difficulties the past few days, and had to make an emergency stop on Luna before flying to Mars to help subdue a brewing revolution there.

Adrien knew that the problems it was having weren't accidental, and that the revolution on Mars was just the first of many. 

""There."" The older woman pointed to the largest landing gear, near the back of the craft, almost directly below the engines. As they neared it, Adrien could hear the dull, low thrum of the engines above them. It reminded her of the generators in her home colony, the ones that used to keep the oxygenators and water-reclaimers running. The one that broke down because the Union of Earth was too slow to replace parts for it, causing half of her colony to die before they realized they were running out of oxygen. Adrien's father was the last one alive, and made sure she was on the last vehicle to leave. He stayed behind for her, and it was all the UE's fault. 

They stopped next to the landing gear, and after a quick look around to see if anyone was watching, the older woman boosted Adrien up to a handhold on the landing gear, allowing her to climb up it and into the well it retracted into during flight. As she entered it, she heard a voice down below her. 

""Hey! What are you doing back here?"" 

Adrien looked down to see two guards walking towards the older woman, who said something that Adrien couldn't hear over the now much louder drone of the engine. 

""You're credentials give you access to the main cabins of the ship for electrical work. This area is off limits.""

Adrien quickly opened the backpack, revealing the large explosives hidden inside. 

""I don't care if you don't know how to get into this ship, you can't be here. Jesus, do they even teach you anything on this rock?""

She placed them around the landing gear, flipping a single switch on each one to arm it. She looked down just in time to see the older woman holding out one hand, seemingly in apology, while reaching into her pocket with the other. 

""I swear, if you don't have proper credentials, I'm cracking your head and putting you in the brig, understand? Jeeze, you Lunans are just a pack of rat ba-""

The older woman whipped out a small pistol and quickly shot the speaking guard in the face. She shot the other in the shoulder, dropping him, but not before he put two rounds into her. Adrien looked down just in time to see the older woman fall, and for a split second they made eye contact, the older woman's grey eyes losing their spark of life as she fell.

""Code red, code red, we have a security breach in hangar 11-A! I repeat, security breach in hangar 11-A!""

Adrien pulled out detonator for the explosives from the bottom of the backpack. She looked down, and saw the guard looking up at her. She held the detonator where he could see it. He raised his gun to shoot. 

""See you soon, mama and papa."" 

She hit the button on top of the detonator.","1443658094"

"Oneirosophy","t5_33ef5","&gt; What I'm taking from this is that if I'm not having fun with the world or a community as it is, and I don't in some way enjoy the project of transforming it (in a way that might involve locking horns), then it doesn't make sense to subject myself to that project. I can use magick to make the world/community conform to the basic things I want it to be.

This is rather very well put, perhaps even better than I put it.  You've said more using less by using a low-on-metaphor approach.

&gt;Basically, when the world is shit, and there's little hope of improvement and the process of improvement is shitty, why keep the world at all? Ugh. I know this.

I also ""know"" it intellectually, but when I observe my true mentality, I notice how much of it still effortlessly and instinctively flows toward that hopeless project, and in so doing, these instinctive flows capture the ""energy"" of my intent which I need to be deploying elsewhere right now.

&gt;I'm just not totally sure that's what I want.

Same here.  I am sure in some ways, but I still don't have all the details.

&gt; I mean, I have like 8 people (including a couple online people) I know on Earth who I don't want to have disintegrate as seemingly othered individuals. This makes me scared to do any world-breaking magick, more than anything else, I think.

Indeed.  And just the other day, no joke, I was thinking how the acknowledgement of others is still absurdly important to me when I don't want it to be.  My thought was, ""If I were to become 100% free right now, who'd notice it?  Who'd acknowledge it?  I'd be 100% beyond convention and beyond anyone's ability to perceive.  As a free being I would no longer be an object in anyone's sensefields.  As a free being my perspective would go completely beyond the scope of all the other perspectives.  And this makes me feel *scared and lonely*, but in a *big* way.""  When I say ""scared"" don't think boo, think cataclysm or apocalypse.

I have this hangup and the other hangup I have is on the continuity of narrative.  I want my narrative to be continuous such that each moment is ""reasonably"" explained by the previous moment, and this stops virtually all serious magick from happening and makes me afraid to live through and endure a severe discontinuity.  Also, TG was talking about this issue as well in the past, so he's probably made a note of it too.

&gt;I don't know that I want to break the illusion of company-having, just because almost all the company here on Earth sucks.

I feel similarly.  I think reflecting on this helps.  Eventually it will be clear what to do next.","1443658099"

There are some exceptions for particularly dangerous optional zones (graveyard), but in general, use http://te4.org/wiki/Zones as your roadmap, not the quests. Make sure you dont try to clear them under the minimum level, and they should go ok.

Because if you had, you would have read about Monzer Taleb, who raised money for Hamas, and the UC Berkely students who chanted ""long live the intifada"" (with no ""political intifada"" disclaimer this time). If you had read the article you would have read about Amir Abdel Malik Ali who explicitly declared that he wanted violence and supported Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad. You would have read about Khader Adnan, who supports suicide bombings and was a spokesperson for Islamic Jihad. You would have read about Mohammad Hammad, a Palestinian student gov't association president who wrote about how much he loves his knife and that he wants to ""stab an IDF soldier with it."" You would have read about Husam Zakharia, who physically assaulted another student because she held a sign saying ""Israel wants peace."" You would have read about Daniel Vessal, a Jewish student who was beaten and called a ""kike"" by SJP members. You would have seen the picture of Northeastern SJP members with machine guns and would have read that Vasser SJP tweeted a Nazi political cartoon.

None of these people are ""calling for justice for Palestinians and equality between Jews and Arabs"" as you claimed. They are all radicals by any definition of the term. Please, we cannot have a discussion if you do not read the article. Go back and read it again, I ask you most humbly.

&gt;The Israelis 

Whataboutery. This conversation is about Ali Abunimah, who is if not a Hamas supporter, at least defends them and runs interference for their war crimes. Do you concede this to be true? A simple yes or no will suffice.

&gt;I'm asking you to prove that a single one of them even believes your clearly inaccurate assertion.

I have already done so. Many times. Go back and read the thread if you missed it.

&gt;The SJP community calls for a just peace in which both Palestinians and Jews are equal.

SJP wants Israel gone. They don't seem to care too much what happens after that. Agree or disagree?

&gt;Well that was a weird non-sequitur. That in no way had anything to do 

Yes it did. You asked for proof that SJP and BDS members are against peace. I linked you to 15+ comments by BDS leaders demonstrating exactly that and you just ignored it. We cannot have a conversation if you are just going to deny every fact that doesn't fit your narrative. If you're not interested in discussion, just say so, and I'll leave.","1443658103"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; They've done studies on identical twins, and even those separated with very different starting points end up actually becoming more similar as time went on.

Sorry. It was late and my head was mish-mashing a couple concepts together. For some reason I assumed the clone was being uploaded into a purely mechanical body even though no one ever said that. Woops. I do agree. The experiences of you and your biological copy would be extremely similar, especially if we somehow made the clone at an adult stage in development. 

&gt; And I think most people don't think of themselves as the same person they were a decade or two ago - I probably wouldn't even like myself if I met the me of 10 years ago.

Very true. It seems to be a concept that creeps its way into a lot of culture implicitly but no one ever seems to want to wrestle with it outright. The idea of a makeover and not recognizing someone after a few years hint towards this idea but just kind of leave it sitting there unaddressed. 

If I've disassembled a table and modified the pieces to make a chair, no one in their right mind would consider the chair still a table, yet for some reason people are different. I don't know if it's just the idea of a soul permeating everything or if people are just really uncomfortable about the topic. 

&gt; What is the difference between death, and gradual change into something new?

I honestly think it's just perception. The 'me' of 4-5 years ago is unequivocally dead. His values, goals, opinions, and experiences have all been changed enough to render him unrecognizable. When did that happen? I think it happens all the time, moment to moment. 

It does seem to bring up a rather disturbing consequence that I've found difficult. If I'm dying every moment, is there any point to planning for the future or even regarding the past as relevant? The only way I can make the answer anything but no is through empathy. The 'me' of both yesterday and tomorrow tend to be people I share a lot in common with so I want better for them and to make them proud. 

&gt; If the new thing can be made faster than changing the old into the new, would death be the sensible option?

It certainly seems that way unfortunately. Putting on hold all the scientific impossibilities, if we somehow were able to genetically engineer humans like in the X-men, I can't logically justify why I should stay over them (assuming limited resources and one must go) when by my own values they're superior.

There are standards for interviewing to gain a full and accurate account from an interviewee - here are excerpts from [UK policy](https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/investigations/investigative-interviewing) (sorry I couldn't find the US equivalent):

* support with active listening

* use minimal encourager and prompts, reflect back what they are saying

* allow interviewee to pause, so they can search their memory, without interrupting

* encourage them to continue their account until it is complete 

* probe topics systematically until as full a picture as possible is obtained

* encourage interviewees to put themselves back into the situation with free recall

* break the account into manageable episodes

* avoid topic hopping


Bob was making the point that the interview appears to demonstrate that the police were focused only on gathering specific info rather than supporting Debbie to give a full account.

So either you get all of your pubbies together somehow and throw so much HP at them that they cant shoot their way out of trouble (a virtual impossibility because of the difficulty of achieving that level of coordination) or you lose.

At least on the weekends. The way you look/dress/style yourself changes the way you think and feel. (most women know this secret full well. Certainly all good actors do.) Play around with more ""wild"" outfits and style choices and that should give you the edge you need to become interesting to sexy girls of your age.

"FearTheWalkingDead","t5_35zlz","Before Nick runs Calvin over Travis and Madison see he's not behaving normally, Daniel (the barber) only shoots the zombified neighbor after everyone sees it attacking Travis, and even then everyone is shocked, especially Travis. The only one being denied information is Alicia, because Madison and Nick want to protect her innocence. Otherwise, communication is more or less constant between key characters except in one or two instances when you were wondering why no one talked before-hand, like when Travis went to the abandoned church without telling anyone (even though Nick knew what he was up to), but lack of communication among the characters has never been a reason for a major plot point occurring. Daniel (the barber) walks to the arena at night, after the Lieutenant is killed and martial law is effectively ended in this safe zone. So, my advice to you is to re-watch the episodes and maybe take notes because you seem to have trouble following plot lines and learning character names, which isn't a big deal but you've made a point of coming to a public forum to shit on something you clearly didn't follow or understand.

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","Ooh, pushy people! I have what I like to think of as a mental arsenal for dealing with them, cause I've got lots of them floating around. Whether it's drinking or anything else, some tactics that I've employed in different situations to great success include:

* Making a joke out of it (""Trying to get me drunk? Not gonna happen!"" ""Wow, you can't take no for an answer!"" ""No means no!"")

* Playing dumb (""Oh, didnt you hear me when you asked before? I said no, thanks."")

* Ignoring future offers/pressure (this works particularly well if I'm in a situation where I can plausibly just pretend that I did not hear.)

* Explicitly ask for something else instead (""No thanks, I really don't want a beer, but you know I would LOVE some of that cake!"")

* Turning it back to them (""Wow, you really seem to want me to have a drink. Why?"" or ""If you think I cant have fun without drinking, dont worry--I'm having a blast."")

* Lie. Completely morally acceptable to do this, IMHO, if you don't want to share your personal business with this person. ""Can't drink while I'm taking my allergy meds"" or something similar. (The caveat I'd add is that it's worth figuring out why you're lying, and if it's to someone whose relationship you really value it might be worth some truth. 

* Being honest. (""No, and please stop asking"")

And, my absolute always-available favorite, the utterly bizarre response. Just drop some completely random non sequitur and let the pressurer figure out what the  hell you're talking about. That's when you make your escape.

Wilson needs live reps to practice learning where to throw the ball to Graham so that only he can get it. With better placement, that red zone pass could have been a TD.

I'd be curious about whether a system more like Jedi Outcast could be implemented, where storm troopers / sith / etc are the same consistent powered enemy right throughout the game, but your character gets more powerful, and they throw in tougher enemies as well.","1443658114"

Tom's Hardware's review of the i5-5675c shows it up against an i7-3770K in various tasks. 

You can see that the Broadwell chip beats it in the tasks that are primarily single-threaded but loses in the multi-threaded tasks such as Blender, Cinebench R15 multi-threaded, WinZip compression, and Showcase 2013. 

If we were comparing the i7-2600, things would obviously be more in the Broadwell i5's favor by another 5-10%.

Overall I would say the Broadwell probably wins out against the i7-2600 but probably not enough to justify the upgrade. 

And if you really care about getting a boost in CPU performance over the i7-2600 then I would either go for a Skylake chip or a Haswell-E chip depending on what king of workloads you would be using it for.


But I would only buy a Broadwell CPU if you are going to be using the integrated graphics (no discrete graphics card). ","1443658114"

I'm pointing out that in any reasonable code, as understood by anyone educated in ethics, they would realize that things like this indicate a bad line of thought by modern developed standards. The fact that some people struggle with this doesn't actually mean those people have a good code. That's a weird form of relativism and moral skepticism that's not really legitimate. Some people simply have bad codes, and don't understand enough to realize it. 

Its not entirely their fault though. Sometimes people have bad codes due to intuitions they have for not-too-terrible reasons. Like, for instance sexual ethics is real, and many Christians note that many people have very poor and lax ones. And so overreact thinking that the opposite extreme is necessary to stave off libertinism. But that's not really true.","1443658117"

Bingo. Best case scenario is you get an offer, ride out your 2 years by becoming the most hated associate because you're using all of your PTO and then you leave. 

What actually happens is you rarely use your PTO, the firm doesn't have to pay it out when you leave, and you're worse off than before. Public already offers a great number of PTO days/flexibility compared to some companies so there's a major loss in this for employees. But it's great for Grant because you have people who are scared to take days off before they hit manager (the work has to get done...) and as anyone in audit knows vacation accruals will be non-existent for GT. 

We already take off a week for Christmas; a week for Thanksgiving; and random days here and other using our PTO.

If they are protected from all harm verbal or physical, then it's like an immune system that never encountered a pathogen. When the real threat comes, the result is predictable. 

Regardless, school environment currently is unhealthy and too sheltered. It teaches children to avoid responsibility rather than taking it, to avoid initiative rather than being upfront and taking on responsibility. It's a step ladder towards diploma mill.

School has the responsibility to pass down the combined knowledge of mankind, and because it is a aggregate of socially inexperienced youth. It should also be a place to let them experiment and develop their skills. School has failed pretty much on both regards currently in some very developed countries.","1443658121"

There wasn't anything about Dorne itself that I found objectionable. The culture, history, language, characters, geography, all of it was as well-done and complete as anything else in the series. It was really just the placement in the books that I wasn't a fan of. If it'd been introduced in AGOT or ACOK, even if the plotlines had the same outcome, I think I would have enjoyed it much more.

But coming in where it did (and I started the books after the show started), knowing I was coming up to a point where the books not only stopped but may actually not end in GRRM's lifetime, I was frustrated by the added threads. So far a lot of time and pages were spent on, say, Quentyn, whose ultimate purpose seems to have been an extremely convoluted plot device to release Viserion and Rhaegal. All that's a long way to say I have no in-world complaints about book Dorne, I guess, just with how it fit into the structure of the story.","1443658124"

If you are not working in a very competitive field, or are not very assertive, American companies can dick you over on vacation and benefits and a lot of people allow it (not that it's right by any means). Not all companies are like that though and I feel like a lot of people jump on job offers without negotiating benefits. Not talking about benefits was definitely one of my early career mistakes. I left a company after six months partly because the vaca time and insurance were terrible and another company offered me way better. A lot of companies do have great benefits though, especially if they want to retain talent. My gf gets 8 weeks total pto and she's expected to take them. She's been with her company just over a year.

Not seen too much weird, but one garage fire was so hot it ruptured an underground gas line. We didn't notice until after the incident when the couple of inches of water on the ground was bubbling up.

is it by design? i have no idea - broncos forward pack is a bit more mobile then most.. so playing literally end2end may be a strategy.. but it sure is risky.

As for penalties.. this is mainly around the ruck - you'll notice that broncos peal very quickly and allow pretty fast 'play the balls', upside - low amount of ruck penalties.. downside - allows other team to roll down the field consistency.

Swapping the processor means you have to disassemble most of the computer, take the mother board out, take the heat sink off, swap processors, apply thermal paste, and put the heat sink back on.

The bigger problem is sometimes these companies skimp on power supply which limits your ability to upgrade in the future.

The tilt is relative to what we're rotating around, so it wouldn't mean we're rotating around a different axis it would just mean there's nothing to notice our rotational axes is tilted from. The wobble is observable because it's earth rotating on two different axes, so one rotation is observable relative to the other.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I did rescue for a few summers down in South America. In narco villages it's a big thing because the local economy is usually so shit that there aren't many other things to do or ways to make money. Add in a lack of policing and there are a lot of open-air fights. 

The physical wounds are easy enough to fix. Even a dog in as bad a condition as this (which is far from the worst I came across) will be better in a couple months. Apart from the wound, which will heal over if kept clean, he's probably got some malnutrition and dental issues that can be corrected in a decent home. 

What really fucks them up is the mental issues. My dogs were pulled early from their mothers, usually had to either forage for food or were given live chicks to ""fight"", and even a few months old were killing other puppies because the cost of procuring a new one was low enough to not care.

A dog raised like that doesn't have any security, warmth, or joy in its life. The closest they come to human contact is a few table scraps being thrown their way or a beating when their owner comes home drunk. They never develop the ""dog"" part of their personality and you've got to move mountains just to get them to do any of the things normal dogs take for granted.

When we first got them, it would be intensive holding for a week. They'd never leave my sight and I'd try to have at least some physical contact at all times. Just to get them used to the idea of a human touching them. No games or leashing or non-urgent medical care, especially nothing with pain involved if it could be avoided, just quiet contact and a soft voice. There would be food and clean water nearby at all times and total isolation from the outside world. 

Soon they'd be comfortable enough to eat around me, at which point touching could become pats in the areas they don't flinch at. This stage was the most difficult because you're constantly pushing their comfort zone but going too far would send them back on edge. They slept in the same room as a human and walked around outside without a lead, still supervised. 

After a few more weeks they were well enough for compassion training. I brought along little stuffed animals in my backpack and assigned one to each of the dogs. Given immediately they'd rip them apart, but as a barrier between the human and the dog they took to them like house dogs. Three or four weeks in they'd be doing supervised play and minor obedience skills, by two months they could be trusted to sleep with the toy and not destroy it. They'd be given more freedom and take a lead, but it was always a very controlled environment up until we finished up their care and got them a home a few months after the rescue. 

Even with as much precaution as that, it was still an animal whose entire genome screams love raised solely to hate. They have trouble with housebreaking and safe play, they're not good with other dogs or people who don't intuitively ""speak dog"", their behaviour mirrors PTSD sufferers whenever they're exposed to triggers like fast movement or loud noises, no matter how much of a normalised environment you try to give them they'll always distrust it on some level. 

Ignoring the jungle hair [this is my favourite rescue as soon as I got her back to the city, maybe a week after the fact](http://i.imgur.com/clTpOda.jpg), [this is her during that first week when she didn't leave my sight](http://i.imgur.com/PVQdmm6.jpg), and [this is when I first found her](http://i.imgur.com/l2LmOAo.jpg) so full of worms that she was as wide as she was long and close to starvation.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","It seems like your brother has struggled a lot with finding his identity, and for whatever reason this new religion has given him a sense of security.  From what you've described it doesn't sound like this religion is changing him in any sort of irreparable ways, it's more of a change of belief.  Unfortunately for you this belief conflicts with the way your family functions, and it seems like your brother doesn't handle this difference with much empathy.

It kind of seems like the real problem is that your brother is being rude to you and your parents, not that he has joined a 'cult'.  Sadly, there isn't much you can do about this other than talk to him.  Don't frame it in an ideological perspective, talk about how his behavior is actually hurting you and your parents (say specific things like forgetting your birthday).  Even if it doesn't have meaning to him, it has meaning to you so you should talk to him about meeting halfway on matters like holidays.

With that, his history of depression indicates that he would be more susceptible to something like a cult, so keep and eye on it.  There isn't much more you can do - he is an adult and will make his own decisions.  Trying to get him to leave the religion could actually push him further away from you, so tread lightly until you see actual damaging affects coming solely from the religious background.  It's also important to remember that he is a part of this new religion because he gets something out of it - maybe try to talk to him about what he likes about it as a way to see what he really needs from the family (it's probably along the lines of acceptance).

Nobody ever suffered for having better optics.  

But people also place a lot of confidence in statistics, which creates opportunities for bad actors to hide behind them.  The more confident the charts and graphs make you feel, the less you will second guess your conclusions, and handwave away doubts that are perfectly valid to have.   

Biggest example of this is how people believe mining pools prevent any single actor from getting large enough to mount a 51% attack. The precision and extensive real-time reporting provided by the pools and sites that aggregate pool stats are a huge red herring distraction from the fact that a single miner could simply split their hashpower proportionally among multiple pools, and noone would be the wiser until it was too late.

First time stayed and watched out of pure curiosity, second time because I told a friend about it and he wanted to join in so I took him.

I went out front for a smoke before he joined in the action. Because watching a friend having sex would be weird.

No. I wash my hands very frequently --enough that I have hand cream next to the sink-- but it's important to realize that mild exposure to chemicals isn't going to harm you. It's actually more likely to help your immune system. That's all I've got for you. Chill! Your body knows how to take care of itself. It deals with millions of bacteria and you never even realize it.

Original Post:

**[OR] Placed phone order for a piece of musical equipment ($950) with a large national retailer. They shipped the one I ordered and a 2nd ""broken"" one. What is my obligation regarding shipping the 2nd item back?**

&gt; Purchased a somewhat hard to find synthesizer online with this retailer.  They promised delivery within two days.  After three days of my tracking # not updating, I contacted UPS.  They stated that the item had not been picked up them and to contract the retailer.  Contact the retailer and they say it is UPS's issue.  Great.
&gt; 
&gt; Call back two days later to the retailer, as I am getting very concerned about my almost $1000 package.  Finally get someone who has knowledge of my order, and they state that shipped me a ""broken"" one by mistake, but recalled the shipment.  They overnight me the one I ordered.  It arrives and all is good in the world.  
&gt; 
&gt; I go out of town for the weekend, and upon returning, I find a large box in the mail from of my large apartment building.  It's the ""broken"" synth that was recalled.  I bring it upstairs, test it out, and it does not seem broken to me.  I go out of town again for a week, and during that time get a couple of calls from a number in the area code of the retailer, but they do not leave a message.  Finally about a week later, they leave a message stating that they think the might have shipped a second item by mistake.  I called them back and confirmed that the did send the item.  I told them I would be happy to ship the item back, and that I just need them to send me a UPS label. The person I spoke to was a manager, and he had no knowledge of my transaction.  He said he would call me back within two hour to get my contact info and send the shipping label.  This was over a month ago, and I have not heard back from them.
&gt; 
&gt; Ethical issues aside, am I under any legal obligation to return the item?  I have made a good faith effort to give them opportunity to get the item back, and they have not followed through.  I have had several issues with bad customer service in the past, but I chose to order this item from them due to the fact that they were the only ones to have it in stock at the time of purchase.  I never signed for either of the items with an actual UPS driver.  Feel like UPS and this retailer were incompetent in handling the transaction.  Sorry for the wall of text.
&gt; 
&gt; tl:dr - received an item by mistake which I did not sign for, made one attempt to return it with the retailer and they didn't follow through.  Can I keep it?","1443658147"

Also you just went from silly posturing to people getting murdered.  In the court they often consider who instigated the aggression in the first place, sure if the guy comes flying out the car with a knife trying to stab you to death you shoot him, but he's probably just going to get out of the car and yell at you for being such a twat because you're being twat by impeding his day.  Not to mention that you really shouldn't go doing shit like this if you aren't willing to deal with some confrontation before flying off the handle and killing people because you're scared.  Hard to use ""I feared for my life,"" as a defense in court when you're doing silly shit like this.

If he's on the sidewalk and not trying to murder any one, you tell the cops and move on with your day instead of trying to start shit just because you got a gun.  Guns are great and all but it's people who think it's a reassurance for when you go looking for trouble that bother me. 

He's in the crosswalk, oh well.  Shit happens, get over it.  Now instead of just walking on at no risk to yourself you've wasted your time, everyone's time, and you're planning on shooting some one if he gets out of the car to tell you you're a moron.","1443658148"

It'll go off in the forever amount of ticks it takes for snipe to fully finish (revolution speed), which won't actually happen because enjoy being in your cocoon for way longer than you should.
2. Ignoring how stupid it is simply because of reason number 1, let's assume they make it so it cancels the ability the tick after it's finished (the proper usage of abilities like snipe). You've now removed part of the skill that comes with maximizing DPS by making sure to cancel snipe as soon as possible without canceling it early.

49er's werent the dumpster fire after week 1's demolition of Vikings.  then got smashed by Steelers and Us.

Bears held up well in Lambeau, were considered a safe ""upset"" pick because of that, then they moved to the worst after we smashed them.

and Saints were deemed a potentital playoff team because LOL its the NFC South.

We are doing what we need to tho, we arent winning close games that was our biggest critique from last year, we were the lucky team because we shouldn't have had that many wins in close games.  People always try to reason ""any Sunday"" with numbers and a game that is played with emotion's and heart cannot be determined with numbers.  

I love everything our team has done and is doing, our history is what keeps us in the shadows.  Because if Brady came in and shit stomped the same teams they would still be deemed as an Elite team this year and who they beat has nothing to do with how they would be precieved.   Look at Seattle, they seem less than stellar so far this year, and they are being praised for blanking out the Pickles led Bears in Seattle.  The same team we aren't shit because lol the bears.

lot of fans are posting with some sort of venom, because of the census is LOL Cards are bad becuase of its the Cards, instead of wow so far we are the top Offense,  and currently a top 5 defense.  I don't care who the opponets were, most historical records are probably also against just as week of teams, but since we only remember their greatness they probably didnt look at their ease of schedule, as a result to their historical greatness.

The persecution complex is getting somewhat annoying, but i can also see the justification, we all seek recogniation on a personal aspect, even if its only for the team that we choose to love.","1443658150"

&lt;Bradherley's Coach&gt; is just an unpleasant story. &lt;The Love of the Brute&gt; is a similar collection of brutalised women. His take on that kind of violence is interesting, I remember reading an interview where he said it was purely to make people uncomfortable and that was the art of it.

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","I m sorry to hear that. You should actually be applauded for giving up her to another family for adoption because you made a responsible decision. It just sounds like they re getting slightly insecure.

this happened with one of my aunts who was adopted away into a rich family, in fact. They didn't like my grandparents bringing her gifts, or even food and preferred that they stay away for good. before the adoption, however, they were all over the place and making quiet comments about how this and that would be good if she was given for adoption and so on..

Eventually, she connected back with her family(she is married with two kids now), she was at my grandfathers funeral and she s also maintaining some contact with her siblings which is really good. 

however this does not mean that she abandoned her adopted family. she still loves them the same.

So I think while they re just being insecure and possessive, I think that growing up, your daughter will see your act for what it is, a good, worthy sacrifice on your part. And she will always care for you because you provided her a directly good environment for upbringing and she will be thankful for it.

The only costume that you *cannot* get from scanning Amiibos and completing the 100 Mario Challenge is the **Builder Mario** costume, which is a yellow and red version of the 8-bit Mario representing the Builder Mario from Super Mario Maker, obviously.

You get the Builder Mario costume by completing all three levels of the Gnat Attack (aka Coffee Break or simply ""fly swatter"") minigame.  
To start said minigame, shake a Muncher until flies pop out and then tap all the flies.

To win the Gnat Attack minigame, tap all the flies as fast as you can.  
Be sure to get rid of the Bomb Flies at the end of the last level.  
The last level is *pretty* difficult.

&gt; One costume you can only get by beating the game you can play by shaking a nipper (those black plants) in the editor.

Actually, /u/samus12345, it's called a [Muncher](http://www.mariowiki.com/muncher), not a [Nipper](http://www.mariowiki.com/Nipper_Plant).

Simplifying fractions? I guarantee you if you give me an exam I'll maybe get 2 right. Times tables? Even worse. Calculus? Easy peasy.

Maybe I'm weird, but I really suck at memorization and if you're the least bit fuzzy on times tables, you can't do
&gt; percentages, fractions, diving large numbers, times tables

especially not on the spot. God, do I even remember how to divide large numbers by hand? Do you start from the left or the right?

It's embarrassing that I need a calculator to figure out what to tip at a restaurant, but every boss I've had has been impressed with my performance at work.

Edit: wanted to add - I know I'm not alone in this, I had a few friends who were the same and one now works on airplane design; the other dropped out. I don't know if OP's boss sent this or not, but I can believe it because of some of the things that were said to me and my friends while we were in college.

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","I can't overstate how much you can learn by simply watching court proceedings, no matter how trivial. You may see an interesting case with an objection you never thought existed become a major decision point. Or, seeing how a trial lawyer interacts with a jury or the judge may give you an insight as to how that lawyer may write or present their briefs/memorandum.

I would take a notepad in and keep track of facts and testimony, or when it was minor hearings, doodle while paying moderate attention. You'll be more knowledgeable about the legal process and system of which you are now an important part. Your colleagues who are stuck in their office/cubicle/dungeon cell might not have the same familiarity with actual court practices which can only hurt them if they're looking to move into a field that has significant court time after their clerkship is done. 

I agree with the other users, use this time to better yourself and perhaps you may see a lawyer or an expert witness in a field you have an interest or passion for.

"premed","t5_2rlp9","I hope I wasn't too harsh.  I wouldn't say your friend is completely barred from getting into medical school.  However, if she isn't going to do all the things other pre-meds do, then her chances are basically 0% of getting accepted.  

Exception: If she's Hispanic/African American, then she's ""underrepresented in medicine"", and therefore a higher MCAT might increase her odds a bit, but she'd still have to do some shadowing/volunteering.  And frankly, even with the race-card, chances are below 30% with that GPA (and 0% if you're any other race).

Now she can increase her odds by re-taking classes, substituting new grades in classes like Gen Chem for older poorer grades.  You still have to list the older grade, but when DO schools calculate your science GPA, they'll use the newer higher grade.  It can dig you out of the hole a little bit, but your odds are still diminished compared to the pre-med who had a good GPA throughout college.    Schools like the safe-bet.

The grad GPA is nice to have, but med schools are really more concerned with the undergrad GPA (or post-bacc GPA).  And while a 3.6 GPA is a big improvement, I think I'd like to see it a bit higher if I were an adcom (but I could be wrong about this).  3.8 shows you really turned a corner, and have above average intelligence, a strong work-ethic, and were willing to do whatever it takes.  3.6 tells me you don't have the ethic down that's going to keep you studying when the going gets rough.  (But those are my opinions).  DO schools are slightly more forgiving for GPA and interested non-traditional students (although it's not that far off from MD).  If she only wants to go to U Mass, it's not going to happen.  Most med students have very little choice where the want to go.  They apply to tons of schools, get one acceptance and go there.  Your friend would have to apply extremely broadly even if she did raise her GPA and hope a school takes her.","1443658161"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I agree that the level of selectiveness has shifted over time (Many people used to be excluded for failing a ""political"" test. The system used to be very aristocratic). But the big issue has to do with legitimacy. When most nations conduct a censuses on education, nation wide tests are held. When samples are used, a wide sampling method is used. In China, tests are often selective and isolated to high achieving centers (For example, China typically uses data from Shanghai and Hong Kong for PISA's, which both happen to be high achieving regions). You can even see on this list, China is listed as ""Hong Kong - China"". We wouldn't take data for Canada and test only Toronto. ","1443658161"

A lot of people use the term RPG wrongly and use it to describe a game with an expansive story and sometimes choices, though that actually describes an adventure game. Most RPG's have adventure elements to them, but it's really the levelling system that defines them.

That being said, just because a game has a levelling system doesn't make it an RPG automatically, it really depends on how the levelling system works in comparison to the rest of the game.

Most people say that Kingdom Hearts is a JRPG and while it technically is, it's really an action/adventure game with minimal RPG elements.","1443658166"

These developers have done some really amazing things with this game, and I get tired of the constant bad mouthing from people. I really enjoy the game, and I do realize that it is not always balanced. I also think that they are smart to try and be methodical about balance changes, as they use data to try and figure out what to do. It means that you have to wait longer for the change, but that most changes are for the better. 

I guess the other side of it, is that I don't understand why people like you continue to play the game that only seems to anger you.

There is plenty of cases where the first two instances have judged all out crazily and HD(the supreme court) have basically lectured them how wrong they were.

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","&gt;  If the Abrams time line is a time line and not an alternate reality

I think this is a distinction without a difference. Regardless of what one might *call* the events in the reboot movies, the *intention* is that these events are part of a series of events which have branched away from the events previously seen in the television series and movies. These new events do not wipe out or replace the events we've already seen. They create a new sequence of events which *also* happen, but separately to and independently of, the original sequence of events.

So, in one sequence of events, Tuvok is born on Vulcan, joins the Maquis, ends up serving on Voyager under Captain Janeway. In another, separate, unrelated sequence of events, Vulcan is destroyed. They're separate. The realities or timelines or universes, or whatever you want to call them, branched in 2233. They share a past before that date, but after that date, they're separate and exist independently of each other. In one reality/timeline, Vulcan was destroyed. In the other reality/timeline, Tuvok was born on Vulcan. Both these things happen. One doesn't affect the other. They're separate. ","1443658170"

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","&gt; Though, it's worth noting the assigned letter rankings aren't completely measurable by numbers

And that is my point exactly. The numbers are simply illustrations on your question on whether or not the bonus would be loss and if there is a parameter cap.

I personally would also tread carefully when it comes to information on the Wiki. It provides decent information on general perspectives, but when it comes to mechanical details, I would not put much faith into their legitimacy without further research.

For example, ""Touka is the antagonist for the first half of Mahou Tsukai"" is an information on the Wiki for a couple of years, despite it being entirely false, as Touka is the antagonist for the entire story.

&gt; and apparently it has some sort of different meaning in Fate/Extra?

Fate Extra uses the Moon Cell system, so they actually get a free resolution for its mechanics within the lore. 

Remember, the nature of resolving inconsistencies and quandaries within lore does not require the resolution to be persuasive, it simply needs to not be a contradiction. 

&gt; Which makes it an inconsistency in the lore.... Which is what this thread is about.

Yes, but you have to realize my initial response was simply addressing a 1 rank increase in A does not lead to EX; my comment was never about the inconsistencies within the lore, simply addressing a mistake in a certain information. 

Personally I disagree that Nasuverse lore is in consistent as a general statement, as most mechanics and lore are actually consistent throughout the different narratives, and most challenges are resolvable and not contradictions.

In the case of Grand Oder, I have my own problems with some lore aspects, such as a Gatling Gun dropping in medieval times, God Hand is disabled but God Force is not, Bravery increases damage despite not being an A rank, and how Cybele is effective on Servants with a mana rank of A. 

However, I am willing to let ""game play"" be an acceptable reason to a certain extent, due to the meta nature of this quandary, and how expecting it to be resolved is highly unrealistic. 

I am also aware that most lore problems in Grand Order are not exactly contradictions, which means there is a possible resolution for them within the narrative.

Basically, as long as the narrative stays true to the established lore and canon, I am willing to let most problems slide if they play the ""game play"" card","1443658171"

"nanowrimo","t5_2ql34","&gt; how did you keep from editing everything all the time?

The whole point of Nano is to get you to stop editing and just write. Editing is for December. :P

&gt;Tips for not doing that

For me, it is making the promise that no one will ever see this monstrosity. I aim for 2k words a day (so I can relax around Thanksgiving) and don't allow any rereading and therefore editing until I have met my writing goal. I even leave a prompt for myself for the next day. Just a little note about what I need to write next. That way I don't start my writing session by reading what I already wrote.

&gt;Planning

There are two camps when it comes to planning for nano. Those who outline and plan all through October and those who just show up on November 1st and start writing. I'm in the second camp. I don't have the attention span to write from an outline. I generally write my rough draft, create an outline from the rough draft, organize the outline and identify problems, and then rewrite until it is readable. Maybe I'll grow up one day but it is not this day.","1443658176"

"FIFA","t5_2qxh7","What you said about prices skyrocketing when the games comes out is how I get started in every Fifa. I buy 12.000 Fifa Points on early access, hope to get lucky in packs and buy the best team I can afford. I then hold on to them until the game comes out and I sell, some of the players doubled in price, some tripled. I bought the best team I could afford again, and the prices kept raising. I sold every player for a lot of profit, and together that probably made me 200k+

I then stop doing any trading. I did get a Iniesta for 10.000 and a Muller for 3.100 (sorry to the guy who missclicked the auction!) so that made me some profit. After that I just buy Fifa Points really. I have a job, I go to school and live at home. Which means that when Fifa is out I budget to spend some money on it because I really enjoy having a lot of coins.

Hi Becky,

If you still think Bernie can’t win, you’re definitely not following the race very closely. Not only can he win, he’s also already winning in some of the most important super Tuesday states.

Also, he polls better than Hillary amongst Republican voters and has a better shot at beating the Rep. nominee.

If you support Hillary, that’s fine. But let’s not pretend it’s because Bernie can’t win.

Best,
Stephen","1443658178"

In WWII we fought against a people that for the most part wanted to be liberated and had an established government. Even when we started invading home lands (with the exception of Japan but that is an entirely different monster) the population was war wary in a way that mimics WWI. Syria strikes me as a situation that is similar to Germany at the end of WWII. They are clearly war wary if you look at the exodus to the Euro Zone. Also if the US went in to fix Syria, a lot of Euro countries would join and put a lot of effort behind the cause because they are tired of the Syrian refugees flowing into their countries. This wouldnt be quagmire of insurgency in the way Iraqi was. If it did result in that, Petrius' policies would be implemented from the start and would help to effectively counter it. ","1443658178"

This is one of the reasons why I think FFG's game is the best one. What I meant is that using Wizards' classes starts to unnecessarily pigeon hole characters by trying to force the into non-existent archetypes. Every Jedi portrayed in the films is a character of their own, with training and skills from a variety of locations. strict adherence to Wizards' class constructions (which FFG thankfully doesn't do very much) creates artificial segregation and runs counter to what is presented in the media.","1443658179"

The Death Note can't bring you back to life if you read all the rules which was share you would even realize it states (even straight out in the anime) that once a name is written the person will die.

The only way for light to come back is in 28 days which is what L did for L Changes the WorLd.

If light was smarter at the end of it. He could have been more prepared and well thought out.

And if they really wanted a sequel they could just do a future scenario where another death note is dropped and the person who finds it is a descendant of the Yagami Family. (possibly where religion is no longer a thing which would make people start to take up faith again.)

Or they could just make a new manga like they are doing now which will be unique and interesting instead of rehashing the story in new ways.","1443658184"

Have your adventure hooks ready and maybe a few initial scenes that you're very certain will happen (e.g., the opening scene), but after that, being a DM is kinda like roleplaying the campaign itself. Like how PCs respond to the world made by the DM, the DM makes the world respond to what the PCs choose to do.

"nursing","t5_2ra72","A few things, but to answer your question first. I think your educator is on the right track - any patient in phase 1 should be 1:1 and the nurse should be competent in ACLS (not just trained). When they are on phase 2, then I think it is not needed. When floor nurses used to float to the PACU, they were not allowed to care for a phase 1 patient. If you are unsure about Phase 1 versus Phase 2, phase one is basically out of the OR, they go into phase 2 when they are taking PO liquids and getting ready to go home. The other way you can think about it, is should anyone requiring 1:1 monitoring be cared for by someone who is not competent in ACLS. 

The best for this job would have been a PACU nurse. Not only do most PACUs have nurses on call, so getting an extra one would have been easy, they are very good at recovering people and give them a couple OB tips, I am sure the patient would have had great care. 

Secondly, considering pregnancy is the most dangerous times in young women's lives - I believe everyone should be ACLS trained and if you are not at a tertiary care hospital you should all sim crashing patients. ","1443658186"

Keep in mind that the things that the Japanese were doing in China were on par, if not worse, than the things that the Nazis were doing in Europe.

That said, I have no interest in defending Islam, or Muslims.  I have an interest in defending Americans, and people in countries with decent civil liberties. 

Also, fun fact, Black people and Jewish people are disproportionally more likely to be targeted by hate crimes than muslims.  By far.  Catholics get almost half the amount of hate crimes commited against them as Muslims (FBI statistics).

The Russians have VERY powerful early game MBTs that are great for learning on. I have seen a T-64 take on six enemies alone, including a T-72, and win. The T-64 is immune to HEAT rounds fired at its front, this is a big help against swagfires a major bane of early tier MBTs.","1443658189"

Very nice work on EW, might I suggest that his Emerald Storm ability get buffed to have increased hit radius and deal 350 magic damage total. I didn't like how his last skill wasn't very good.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","This will probably get lost in the comments but I will say it anyway.

Finally decided to go on vacation to visit some family. My cousins took me to some nice places like concerts, nightclubs and I met some nice girls. 

This changed my perception, I realize destiny wasn't more than a game to pass time, instead I was taking it as a job. Finally after my vacation was over I lost interest in the game and decided to start working out. Now I've lost some weight and even though I still play Destiny, I don't worry about doing the raid or getting the best gear, I just play to have a moment of fun and not because I feel I HAVE to. Anyways I didn't type this to hate on anybody if you enjoy destiny then by all means continue playing it, but just be aware that you might not notice all the cool things and life experiences you might be missing.

"makinghiphop","t5_2sqw4","TL;DR I came with a simple idea, and left with a uselessly elaborated wall of words. Now read.

Do you edit your lyrics? Do you keep note of syllable count and where the bulk of the syllables are in the bar? Are you using words that don't roll off your tongue nicely? Everyone has words that can say easily and ones they have trouble saying in succession (like me and the word succession). If I'm using a word like succession, I can't chop then say that word in the middle of chopping. Hell nah. However, if I twist my pronunciation of it in an odd way in a different flow, I can make it come out smoothly. 

If it's in my bar, and I need it but can't say it, I'll edit my lyrics in a way that'll let me say what I need to say, but deliver it nicely. If I need to rework bars, delete words, add them, rephrase things, etc, then it's my choice to do it or be lazy and say fuck it. My best bars come out after rephrasing and finding unique ways of saying things.

Lastly, even if the written verse is a bit sloppy, if I spend a good 2 hours or more rehearsing them, (many previous flow kinks are worked out by now) I start to think of new ways to say my shit (so many different ways to say a word my dude). I start to see what does work and what doesn't flow-wise. Just recently I felt really confident in my verse, rehearsed it like hell. When I went to record, it *sounded off* on certain places, it didn't *feel* off, but it sounded off. It was really frustrating figuring out how I would fix my lyrics, but I eventually got my times worth spending that extra 30min to an hour editing, recording, editing, and recording. Sometimes it's only me that catches it, but it's the little things that add up.

^ That's the worst process to me, I hate doing it (going in depth and reworking everything). I usually do my edits during the writing phase, but doing overhauls and spending 30min figuring out one line really pisses me off, especially given some verses roll out smoothly asf, but you gotta do what you gotta do.","1443658193"

This ""Do you like Arsenal? Or just Arsenal with trophies"" mentality is what's sinking the club. Don't confuse ""not winning"" with ""not competing"", you can give your best and be competent, be up to the challenge and don't win, that's fair, but what happened vs. Olympiacos is lack of desire and ambition.
I know this might sound a little bit exaggerated, but it's been happening for years and no one at the club seems to care.

Now, I know we've won the FA Cup again last year, but it's time we aim for bigger things. The time to boost our squad was this summer and we failed miserably. Maybe we'll end up winning the PL (fuck, I hope so) and I'll have to take all this back, but as of now it doesn't seem likely.","1443658194"

3 weeks ago I was at a flea market and found a cheap Power Masters Prime. I bought him. 

Nostalgia swept in and I went looking for toys from my youth in my attic. I ended up buying a G1 reissue Optimus to go with my battered original. 

That led me here, where the trouble began. All your amazing pics. So now I have an MP Prime, Ultra Magnus, and CW Devastator. But fear not, I've already preordered MP Ironhide and am kicking around DX9 Carry. So thanks guys, my wife hates you all ;)","1443658196"

White Tiger/Jackson - Ari - Griffith

Clarisa - Jay - Shu

Black Mash

for the most part you only need 1 attacker in mid and 1 in back. Right now you need more relevant 5stars to start building a team; atm it's all over the place.

first priority is scout a striker. I'd go for either Hiro or Sharr (so you can put Duke/Shu on color), but if you want to go rainbow then Ravian works too.

just as important as striker is a GK. Isillia/Kei is top tier atm (or Jin if you can find him).

then after that you can start considering which color (or rainbow) to build towards.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","If Veigar gets the stun cast starting the second she jumps in, he takes the Q damage she had on previously (she isn't going to jump w/o the mark), the E damage, the Q proc, the W, and about a fifth of her ult.  That is still a LOT of damage for upfront burst on a squishy target, and she isn't going to jump him when he has full hp either.  That combo can easily do 1/2 to 3/5 of his hp bar early on, and it gets worse later on.  


Also the key to beating Veigar as Kha when you are jungling is to evolve wings, have your mid pressure him under power and have them poke him.  When he gets about half health, jump in, do the damages, jump out.  That can be done repeatedly, and he isn't going to rush Zhonyas unless he absolutely has to, and it won't be something he can do quickly if under a lot of pressure. ","1443658198"

My suggestion is that if the mom is your friend, by all means, get her a gift. Everyone else will be getting the spawn things.. get some little things for your miserable pregnant friend.

I didn't reject the story at face value, I rejected it  based on the facts of the particular case. Before you blindly support the accusation I would suggest you do the same. I would be glad to point you towards the facts of the case. 

Just to reiterate:

&gt;This was a story I researched thoroughly (mostly police reports) and wanted the truth on. 

So I have actual documentation if you are actually interested. 

----------

EDIT: Here it is... I posted this nearly one year ago:

&gt;I believe Winston is an idiot and presumably a bad person who does not treat women respectfully. That makes him someone I’d advise my daughter to keep away from. What it does not necessarily make him, is a rapist.

&gt;I would like to ask you to read on to see why before dismissing this statement in anger (if anyone has FACTS that contradict anything here, feel free to link to them. I, for once, am not interested in debating. If you have facts that are contradictory, feel free to correct anything I'm saying):

&gt;**Short version:**

&gt;If Jameis Winston raped Erica Kinsman, she ruined the chance to bring him to justice by continually lying. 

&gt;**Long version**

&gt;**1. Statements made by the accuser are directly contradicted by physical evidence:**

&gt;* The accuser claims to have blacked out and woken up in a taxi with Winston.
&gt;* We know the accuser did not black out by getting hit on the head (which was the claim on the initial 911 call), nor was there other evidence of physical attack of any kind (physical examination). 
&gt;* After the physical examination revealed this, she then stated she was blacked out from alcohol or drugs. 
&gt;* We know her BAL was .03 that night, extrapolated to .10 when she left the bar, far short of what would cause a blackout, barring other drugs.
&gt;* We also know she was not drugged (toxicology reports). 

&gt;(*Aside: According to [the police report (PDF Warning)](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/assets/3679987/tpd-documents.pdf), note that Tallahassee Police gave her a rape kit that night, performed physical examinations, set her up with a rape counselor, etc. Furthermore, Winston wasn't identified as the alleged attacker until six weeks later. People crying ""malfeasance"" and ""preferential treatment"" don't seem to realize that TPD didn't know this was about Winston for six weeks, because the accuser didn't name him until then*). 

&gt;**2. The main impetus behind the Police Department and State Attorney’s Office dropping the investigation was the Kinsman’s testimony, which the State Attorney described as “problematic”.**

&gt;* Kinsman's friend testified against her, stating that Kinsman ""wasn’t drunk"" and that Kinsman showed her a text from Winston asking her to meet him in the front. The friend claims Kinsman asked her if she should go. The friend stated she agreed. 
&gt;* The statement of Kinsman's friend is consistent with the statements of Winston and his two friends.
&gt;* There is evidence Kinsman deleted text messages from her phone that were sent around the time her friend testified. Kinsman claimed to have been blacked out during the time these deleted texts were sent.

&gt;**3. The accuser told multiple, conflicting stories about the actual sexual encounter:**

&gt;* In one statement she claims she lay there without resisting because she was too drunk,
&gt;* Another statement claims she resisted but he overpowered her,
&gt;* Yet another statement claims she couldn’t remember anything that happened because she was going in and out of consciousness,

&gt;These facts alone are enough for the case to be over, without ever even talking to Winston. You can’t explain them away by saying the TPD was negligent, or that FSU interfered. It is a remarkably weak case, and the weakness mainly stems from the evidence (physical examination, toxicology reports, breathalyzer, Kinsman’s friends’ statements, etc.) all contradicting Kinsman’s statements.

-----

&gt;The reason I take the New York Times’ motivations into question is this:

&gt;1. The New York Times reported a story that the Tallahassee Police put pressure on a student not to file charges against Jesus Wilson for allegedly stealing his scooter. [The alleged victim’s father stated the New York Times was mistaken](http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/2014/10/14/pressure-file-charges-fsu-wilson-case/17243423/).

&gt;2. The New York Times reported a story on FSU player P.J. Williams not getting arrested for getting in an accident, panicking, leaving the scene, then coming back within 30 minutes while everyone was still present. The officer gave him two citations rather than arresting him for felony hit-and-run. Picture hearing this story about a random 19 year-old. “Police corruption” is not something that would enter your mind; you’d think the policeman just used discretion and thought it was not worthy of a felony arrest and trial. But the New York Times decided otherwise.

&gt;3. When the latter story was marked as spam on Twitter, the [New York Times Social Media Manager Talya Minsberg immediately \(a.\) blamed FSU fans without evidence, and (b.) compared FSU fans to the Communist Chinese Government — see for yourself](http://www.chatsports.com/florida-state-seminoles/a/New-York-Times-Compares-FSUTwitter-To-Communist-Chinese-Government-15801).

&gt;It seems to me that one tweet revealed the pure vitriol the New York Times had developed towards FSU and Tallahassee. They seemed convinced the University and the City Police conspired to let Jameis Winston get away with rape (which is patently absurd when the facts are reviewed), and their passion regarding the real issue of campus sexual assault has colored their objectivity and reduced their ability to see anything they do not wish to see.

&gt;It makes me think that the New York Times is mostly interested in keeping FSU/Tallahassee as a convenient bogeyman/enemy of social justice issues that are important to them (regardless if the facts actually make FSU a bogeyman). It’s disingenuous on their part.","1443658204"

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","They got worse over the years because the Giants changed how they used him over the years. It's common knowledge amongst Giants fans that Cruz has been and always will be most effective in the slot. 

That dip you're referencing? It came after the Giants moved him from the slot to outside the numbers. Cruz became a primary receiver rather than a slot receiver because the Giants had no one else to throw to (Nicks was gone, and Manningham had been traded). 

Enter Beckham. Cruz is now scheduled to move back into the slot. But wait. Beckham gets injured before the season starts. Cruz moves back out of the slot. Cruz underperforms outside the numbers as expected, but gets injured before Beckham can come back and allow him to move back to the slot. 

While Cruz is injured, Odell becomes OBJesus - drawing more attention than any Giants wide receiver has garnered...ever. With Cruz slated to re-enter the slot, and with OBJ providing a bigger distraction than Nicks ever could, AND with a new pass-happy scheme from McAdoo...

Well there's a lot more to it than ""Oh well Cruz has been sliding down in fantasy points in recent history."" Times change, and teams change. The NYG of today look a lot like the NYG from when Cruz was putting up huge fantasy numbers. They don't look like the NYG from when Cruz started slumping.

So that's why people are high on Cruz. All the pieces are in place for a monster season. The only one missing is Cruz himself.","1443658206"

That leaves $820/mo that is not budgeted for bills. 35%, which generally goes to savings.

There's a month of expenses as buffer in the checking.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; The inhaler did not have her name on it and for all the teachers/admins know it could be from someone else who handed it to her. Is that likely? No. But let's say that DID happen...

I had to kill that lady. Yeah she was walking by and unarmed but lets say she was yelling at me, and let's say she had a gun.... If scenarios are just a gateway to unfounded claims. Let's stick with the story.

They took the inhaler from her. They didn't find it on the ground. They know it belonged to her. She had a coughing fit, they withheld  her medicine for fear of breaking the rules saying, ""She'll probably be fine."", She's 9. Not every teacher has to understand every condition a student might have. That's why you let the kids do what's good for them and what works as they're the ones who've spoken to a doctor about it. If the kid didn't have the paperwork put a note in her bag telling the parents to fill out the paperwork, and call if they have any questions. 

There were kids in my school who had 1 kidney and needed to go to the water fountain all the time, there were kids with diabetes and needed to snack before lunch time, like 1/4 of the kids had inhalers, especially for recesses. The teachers didn't pretend to know the nuances of the kids' conditions, they just let them do what needed to be done at the advice of their parents and doctors and move on with class.

Using your exact words

""The assassins job is to kill the enemy carry. If they cant kill them, then they are being countered.""

if diana cannot kill kat, it doesnt mean she is being countered. it means shes weak

in this scenario, is kat countering diana?

The imagination based ones never really got to me. Calling me a whale or a land moose or faking an earthquake as I walk by. Obviously those things are grossly exaggerated so for some reason those didn't get to me much. For me the comments and things that got to me where the ones that were more reality based. Yeah, I do sweat a lot so yeah, I might ripen quicker than others. yeah, I weazed when I took a breath. Sure my food bill was higher than some. Friends not inviting me to do things because I would slow them down or make it less fun because I couldnt walk far and had to sit often. Those things hurt.

To this day I hate 2nd stories, balocnies or cars that are full. They freak me out because my weight seemed to freak everyone else out. But now a days I know I am doing something about my weight so the comments and looks and stares dont infect me like they used to. I try my hardest to block them out knowing that I am doing something about it. Eating much better, working out several times a week and doing more than just strolling on a treadmill. 

Do I need the extra motivation? You bet your ass. Even started a FB page to 1. take all the weight based stuff of my main page and 2. to get motivation and help from others. So far the motivation has been helpful and gives me a reason more than myself to keep going.

If you don't already live here, the easiest housing to find is going to be temporary rental like AirBnB.  Then you could hit the streets to find a job.  Most long-term rent situations are going to ask for two months' pay stubs and/or proof of substantial savings.  Sometimes they don't, if you're lucky.  Finding housing (even rooms) is competitive.  They will probably run your credit and also look at how much money you make.  A lot of people get eliminated off the bat based on numbers--even if a master tenant likes you, landlords like to do BG checks.

Monthly rent for a room usually bottoms out at $1,000/mo.  If you work full time at minimum wage (12.25/hr) your gross income will be $1960/mo.  You might not be able to afford school, if you can even handle full time work + school.  It is *not* worth dropping out of school to run away.

Focus all of your effort and energy into school and transfer to a four year school.  It sounds like you're already academically inclined, since you work in teaching.  Go to school.  That is your way out of being a financial burden.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I have no idea why governments have this kneejerk reaction that they should protect the investments made by the owners of cab companies and cabbies. 

If I invest in Enron and lose all my money then that was just a stupid investment. I don't go running to the Mayor and people who run the city and have them ban my stockbroker from keeping my money. 

The same with lawyers, doctors, restaurants, etc. Why does the city feel that it needs to regulate cabs yet it will allow restaurants to open and close as the economy dictates. 

Then there is the ethical nature of being able to buy some kind of taxi medallion. They somehow thought that this was a ticket that would allow them to exploit the citizens of a city. By the very nature of this thinking it is nice to see them punished by the realities of economics. 

On top of all that there is choice. Let's assume for a minute that Uber is not as good as a taxi in any way, more expensive, smellier cars, an app that does nothing but tell lies, drivers who randomly assault passengers based on a random number picked by uber, and they get into accidents about ever second ride.

Then I still like uber because it is a choice. If their service was that terrible then another ride company would come to town and give me a better choice. But this is predicated on the concept that finally competition is allowed and not arbitrarily banned by some misguided government officials who are clearly not looking out for me or my wants and needs but the wants and needs of some very very tiny group of people. 

In my opinion Uber is a test of how corrupt and corruptible any given government is. Take Halifax Nova Scotia. Most people that I know there assume that all levels of local government are some combination of corrupt or incompetent. Uber is pretty much a capital crime there.

Right now there's a huge reduction in electricity consumption vs power. sometimes there's just a new OpenGL or DirectX version.

Probably more relevant for d3 leagues where there is a wide range of competition. Could basically add up all the stats accrued in the whole league and come up with a strength of league formula that would come into play with the overall standings.

So let's say you have a league that is 2% weaker than the average d3. Everyone in that league would have their roto points in the overall leaderboard decrease 1%, give or take. The razzball commenter leagues have something similar. It is somewhat flawed, I'd lean towards making the league strength adjustment pretty small even if we did do it.

I used to cook exclusively with coconut milk instead of any dairy, and I still prefer it. Use it when you're whipping eggs for omelets to make the omelet a little fluffier. Perfect for sauces, of course.

"TeraOnline","t5_2s527","Pretty much what N0rthWind said. You're just making stuff up to support your claims. Distant Blade does **NOT** knockdown, unless the other person is jumping, and if the other person is jumping, you can knock them down with auto attack. I've also never seen OHS knockdown someone. In this [video of OHS spam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVEneDVj8IE), I don't see OHS kd even once. Point out a time in that video, or perhaps another video, where OHS knockdowns a player. Because I've never seen it do that.  
  
I just said RF has a 2.25s cd with Deadly Gamble... That means in 24s (duration glyphed), they can kd 10 times in a row, and that's not taking resets and Scythe into account. And you're telling me slayers can knockdown 10+ times in 24s? KDS (8s) can be used twice, Eviscerate (10s) can be used twice and MS (12s) can be used once. Even without DG, that's 5 RF (w/o reset) and 3 scythes in 24s. I just proved with math that Warriors have a stronger KD game. Slayers can do fine in PvE too, but there's a reason Slayers are at the bottom of the [PvE ranking in KTERA](http://s2021369.tumblr.com/post/128885777941/q-what-is-the-best-dps-in-k-tera#notes). Slayers just got [buffed in KTERA](http://forum.teratoday.com/topic/1207-ktera-september-10th-update/) so that's why it's equal to Archer in KTERA, but currently it's below Sorc in NA TERA. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvtcdFkYPdE) was the fastest GG clear I found for slayer. Every single other class has a faster clear time, even [sorc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlM2VHR6mkg). Note that Yosha isn't even using nocs AND he's using Generation+15. Sure, you're free to believe whatever you want but it's fact that slayers are worse than every other class in PvP. I guess Xii/Tsumori's just wrong about slayers being bottom tier in [his post](http://tera-forums.enmasse.com/forums/player-vs-player/topics/State-of-DPS-classes-in-3v3s-v3308?page=1#post-1353334) even though he has tons of 3s experience and he was usually in top 10 when he played like [here](http://i.imgur.com/aYrlV0O.png). Also answer this. If slayers are so much better than warriors, why is that there are a bunch of warriors on the 3s ranking and not even a single slayer on there?  ","1443658218"

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","So basically... if you follow his rankings, I'm assuming you try to pick up the highest ranked team that's available. I assume everyone on average does this. So then in order to figure out how effective streaming is, I take a weighted average of the scores of who everyone picked up. If I could somehow know exactly who everyone used, I'd just multiply like ""10000 people used Arizona who got 28 points, and 20000 people used Cleveland, who got two points, for a weighted average of 11.33 points (10000*28 + 20000*2)/(10000+20000)

However, I can't actually ""know"" who everyone picked up, so I have to kind of guesstimate. I assume that teams near the top of the ranks will be picked up in proportion to their availability; if a team is 80% owned, half as many people will pick them up as do a team that is 60% owned. So then I have to figure out which teams to average. I have to try to figure out which teams are likely to be available, based on ownership percentages. I do this by using statistics. If the top team is 80% owned, that means if you looked at a bunch of random leagues, there'd be a 20% chance they were available in any one random league. So let's say 20% of people can choose them. Then the next ranked team is 60% owned. Same thing; there's a 40% chance that they are available in a random league. But! That doesn't mean that together, 20% + 40% = 60% of leagues can use either of those teams, because in some of those leagues, *both* of them are available. The likelihood of *at least* one of them being available is 52%, or 100% minus the likelihood of both being taken (opposite of neither available is at least one available), which is 100% -(80%*60%*) = 100% -48% = 52%. That's because in those 80% of leagues where the top team is taken, 60% of them, the second team is taken.","1443658220"

I've just been involved in way too many discussions on these forums where I've presented what I'd call proof and it's been shot down for no good reason.  Not legitimately/evidentially shot down. Just, shot down, as coming from a 'feminist' or 'SJW'. 

And, you've been on this merry-go-round before, right? What always happens is that the two 'combatants' cite their sources and then rebut and then someone stops replying because they're wrong, or it is too fucking annoying, or they just don't have time.  

I, too, suffer from major time crunch issues, and not just now but always; work absolutely gets in the way as does--on fortunate occasions--play.  

So, yeah, I get what your objections are. I disagree. Not going to have the source vs source argument because, god, I've done that a million times before.

I believe I am older than /u/Mudbunny, and I am tired of this shit. Not tired enough to stop participating, but tired enough that after a long day at work and carving out time to fit in relationships and hobbies, well, this battle of the citations that have been cited a million times before has stopped being interesting to me.

That said, there are some things that I just know are atrocious and I don't want to pay for -- or that I just don't care *that* much about and so I'll pirate them instead.  It's not 'right', but I acknowledge what I do.

That said, the people (like the much-lionized Oatmeal) whining that HBO managed to ""*force*"" them to pirate Game of Thrones because they 'could not get it legally' (except, you know, by either subscribing to HBO or waiting for the BluRay to come out) just piss me off.  I get that you want what you want and all, but the fact that you're given two or three ways to get something, but not the one specific one you prefer entitles you to it is just ridiculous.

Anyway, I agree with you 100%.  Some of piracy surely is a service issue - but there are also people who won't buy stuff regardless of how cheap and easy it might be to get legally.

Me?  I'd rather spend $5 and get it legally instantly than spend $0 and half an hour to get it for free usually.  But I'm lazy and like instant gratification.","1443658227"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","RBMK were graphite moderated and very different from the CANDU design. 

The phenomenon that you describe is called a positive void coefficient. It comes from being 'overmoderated', where boiling effectively reduces the amount of moderating material between the fuel elements - decreasing parasitic absorption and thus increasing overall reactivity. 

CANDU is slightly overmoderated, and does also have a positive void coefficient, but as I understand it is much much smaller than the RBMK design.  

This is not in of itself a fatal flaw. To compensate for the positive void coefficient, the CANDU design includes two automatic fast acting shutdown systems, which are independent of the normal regulating system.  Both are triggered to automatically shutdown the reactor if a rapid power increase occurs. The shutoff rods also do not have the graphite tips that so exacerbated the Chernobyl accident upon activation.  

It's no more an issue than PWR shutoff rod ejection - an accident which cannot occur in CANDU due to the low pressure calandria. ","1443658227"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","No, it wouldn't. But America today isn't held up as the ""bastion of progressive society."" We're seen as the weird, mentally-challenged cousin who everyone else tolerates because of his money. How many of these people panicking over Muslims ""invading"" *their* continent do you think looked over and shook their heads in disapproval when the American illegal immigration debate raged at its height?

Plus there's the difference that racist Americans who irrationally panic over immigrants are panicking over *illegal* immigrants, not legal immigration. It's a fucking shame that we're too busy panicking over desperate people rather than looking at what's actually wrong with our legal immigration process, but that's how it is. In Europe, these are desperate people fleeing a war the West indirectly caused on multiple levels who are applying for legal asylum and/or residence. The US gets more *legal* immigrants every single year than the entirety of refugees who are part of this crisis facing an entire *continent*. We can't even record the number of illegal immigrants the US gets every year, and I guarantee they're comparable to the legal immigrant count if not far greater.

And there's the problem of what the issue is actually about as well. With this refugee crisis, the *actual* problem is finding a place for all these people to live on relatively short notice, and then hoping these pennyless people will be able to get jobs to provide for themselves. Yet this is a solvable problem, given time, especially for European countries that pride themselves on their ""social safety net.""

Yet the critics who are declaring the ""imminent death of European culture"" seem to be more concerned that these refugees are coming at all, simply because they are Muslims. They're assuming these people are radicals not because of what they have done, but from what they are. It's blind panic because IS is also Muslim. That's completely ignoring the way IS actually operates with its radical devotees. IS isn't just some carbon copy of al-Qaeda, which seeks to strike out at the West by fermenting radical cells in Western countries - IS seeks to establish an Islamic fundamentalist caliphate in the actual Middle East, and seek to strengthen that effort by *attracting* radicals *from* Western countries.

In the US, the biggest problem with illegal immigration is its inseparable association with organized crime. To enter the US from Mexico, the vast majority of illegals *must* rely on human traffickers (especially since border security has tightened over the years), many of which exploit the desperation of these people to traffic drugs into the country. They have no choice because the traffickers are the ones with the resources and established network required to move large numbers of people in secret. The traffickers like this arrangement because these illegals are disposable - they can be discarded by their ""benefactors"" and future employers at any time if it's profitable. By contrast, the refugees are seeking to enter Western Europe through *legal* means.

Week 1

**Anerobics (PER + STR)**

Darcy does short series of sprints along a beach. Everytime he has a short break inbetween before starting again.

**Anerobics (PER + STR)**

Darcy jumps into the cold water and swims as fast as he can and sees how long he lasts before becoming exhausted.

**Anerobics (PER + STR)**

Darcy finds a huge rock and tests himself to see how many times he can lift it before his muscles give out

**Anerobics (PER + STR)**

Darcy tests himself by seeing how long he can hold a plank

**Anerobics (PER + STR)**

Darcy was disappointed by his last swimming result so he decides to give it another go, to see if he can last longer this time

**Melee techniques (DEX + SPD)**

Darcy's fighting style requires a lot of jumping, so he has decided to work on jumping higher and with more power to make his attacks more devastating.

Week 2

**Anerobics (PER + STR)**

Darcy once again tries to beat his record for how long he can swim as fast as he can, before getting too tired.

**Melee techniques (DEX + SPD)**

He works on his 'overhead slash' attack. This attack is pretty self explanatory and he works on using his upper body muscles to bring down his sword faster.

**Melee techniques (DEX + SPD)**

Darcy works on his flying kick attack, he is focusing on bringing his front leg into his target with more force then he currently does.

**Melee techniques (DEX + SPD)**

He is handed a flintlock pistol to practise with in case the need to use one ever arrives. He stood 10 feet away from his target and after an hour of shooting at it, he still didn't hit it once.

**Melee techniques (DEX + SPD)**

Darcy practises his 'uppercut kick' attack, trying to bring more force behind his leg

**Melee techniques (DEX + SPD)**

Darcy gives the shooting with a flintlock pistol one more go and is once again unsuccessful.","1443658229"

"Rowing","t5_2qljq","Have helped start and am currently on an alumni board:

Regardless as to the status of the team, the alumni association itself should become a 501c3 so that it can accept donations and provide a tax write off. If the club itself is a 501c7, then it's tax exempt, but cannot provide a tax write off for the donations it receives.

Organize and become a 501c3 and then alumni can donate to the alumni association/foundation/organization rather than the school (if the school is as inept as the one I went to). The main goal should be to raise enough money to start an endowment. That is just money that keeps giving over and over again. But the big thing with endowments is that the max funds allowed to be withdrawn every year should NOT be withdrawn! Allow the money to grow and collect interest until it gets large enough to make an impact. And as zigzog said, do not just give the team money! They are college kids who don't know how to handle large funds (trust me, I've watched it happen). Work with the coach that is there. As an adult that depends on this as a source of income, they should care a lot more about how each dollar is spent.

The goal, in my mind, should be that the club itself sets its yearly budget to account for coaching salaries, travel to regattas, and any other usual annual cost, while setting aside some money every year to help make large purchases every few years (boats, oars, launches etc). The goal of the alumni should be to provide money/equipment the team should not budget for themselves. So, for example, the alumni should aim to raise money for a new boat. Not necessarily the entire payment, but rather than just donating money for operations, it should go to specific cost bucket. You don't want to get into a situation where you are just throwing money down a black hole.

Also, coach's salaries for club teams are usually very low. If alumni aren't donating large sums of money and all you can get together a year is a grand or two, think about chipping in to help with the coach's salaries. That way a coach may stick around longer and you can work with him/her to help build stability over the years towards better results and new equipment. Also, if you're contributing to their salary, then they will generally care about what you have to say because if they ignore you, you can pull the funds from them. Or think about providing a scholarship for a rower who can't always afford dues. If it comes through the alumni, you can have a say in who gets it. Rather than the kids giving it to their friends who might not truly need it, the alumni and coaches can work together to select someone who may be useful to the team.

If what you're really talking about is just getting a hand in the team's operations, then you should approach it a little differently. As I've experienced, the kids at the school generally are hesitant to allow someone they don't know access to decisions and spending priorities. So you almost have to act as a separate body. But one thing that we've done is provide incentive and our insight. So, we help with coaching searches by providing support in the interview process as well as crafting job postings. The way we get the current rowers to buy into us helping is by providing funds to help pay for coaches or small items that they would like, but can't necessarily afford.

Make the alumni board useful. Don't set out to control the team or anything, it is their team. I know that it's hard if you really care and want to see the team flourish, but you have to let kids make mistakes sometimes. Go out and attempt to get the team to see you as an asset that they would like to keep in the loop so that you continue to help. Also, organize and go to some of the bigger races they have. Getting face time with the team is the best way to gain trust.","1443658231"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Prayers of faith are always answered by God, as long as they are not against His will. This is a problem since non of us can even begin to understand God's will, and why he does certain things.
But when we read Matthew 9:21-22 ""for she was saying to herself, ""If I only touch His garment, I will get well."" But Jesus turning and seeing her said, ""Daughter, take courage; your faith has made you well."" At once the woman was made well.""
So if the person has faith that God will heal his cancer, God will heal them. But having such faith in God means you will also understand that His will must be put first, and if it's your time to pass from this world by His will, It must happen. Saying God decided not to help, or that He never had control in the first place, means you're limiting God's power to try and make sense of something we cannot understand with our sinfull nature, as trying to understand a perfect and omnipotent God is beyond our understanding.","1443658232"

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","My partner and I are into very different types of people, so I have to admit that I don't always like the people he dates. I support him dating, but these people are just ...not my people. And it seemed like he wanted everyone to get along and be happy and have a giant happy poly family and it was a lot of stress on me to actively try and like people I didn't like.

And then I realized I didn't have to. Which, I'm not disliking them. I'm just not trying so hard or making a huge effort. Part of it is that one relationship (where I tried REALLY hard to like her) ended up fizzling out anyway and I just realized that his relationships with other people might just come and go. I plan on sticking around for a while so I'll just let things happen organically with other partners that are around for a while too, instead of trying to get myself to like everyone who he is interested in.

And I also kind of told him off for making such a big deal out of the 'happy poly family' thing. It's one thing to have a dream where everyone gets along, and it's another to be sort of pressuring your partners to be best friends when they're not. 

And I'll tell you, our relationship is a lot better and I feel a lot kinder towards my metas now. Being able to focus on connecting with him instead of connecting with all my metas makes a huge difference, because there's only so much time and energy I can put into relationships. And I'd rather do that with ones that truly enrich who I am. I'm happy he's happy, but if quiet introvert me doesn't want to hang out often with his loud extrovert partner, it's totally my prerogative. ","1443658238"

For years my go-to pedal has been the Pearl Eliminator. It is infinitely adjustable, which I like but can be off-putting or intimidating for some users, and has been with me for close to 10 years and hundreds upon hundreds of shows. 

A few years ago I decided I needed to get a backup pedal and I stumbled across [this guy](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/drums-percussion/pdp-concept-double-pedal), the pdp concept pedal, and it has unexpectedly become a mainstay on my kit. I love it and it is perfect for what I do.

The teeth/claws could probably go through skin and most clothes but not wood for an example. It's stone, not steel. Maximum speed is around 20 mph. As for strength, they can't really carry that much, I'd say about one average sized person each. The difference is that one weighs more than the other and is slightly stronger.


&gt; How fast does it move? Can it jump? How strong? What kind of orders can you give?

16 mph, it can jump but not that high. It's as a strong as a master swordsman. She can give orders ranging from go kill that guy to do the dishes, however it specializes in combat and team work and giving it household chores is just asking for something to happen.

&gt; How strong is he? (How much can he lift?) How intelligent? (Compared to, say, the average person) How fast? How can he follow orders? Are you actually going to battle with him, or is he for role play only like last time?

He can lift as much as the world's strongest man, however this strain would cause visible strain and cracks on his body. He is a completely blank slate but memorizes each thing told to him making him constantly learn, I kinda based him on Data a little... He is loyal only to Sylvi and all she has to do is tell him something and he'll do it.

&gt; Power Drawbacks: All of her automatons cost energy, golem cannot feel emotions unless programmed. Golem must have piece of paper with ""programming"" on it and paper must be taken out one day a week for 24 hours.

&gt; This works. How would the programming be written? Any combat-based drawbacks? What happens if the paper falls off? How often can she create a new golem? You might want to include more drawbacks XD

Well, as I stated before the joints are weaker than the rest of the body. She writes his code in binary then speaks the Hebrew word for truth. Once this happens the paper transforms into a paper with said word on it. All automatons are weak to water as it softens them. If the paper falls out of its mouth (forgot to put in description, sowee) Reggie will ""go to sleep"" until paper is put back. Sylvi can create new bodies but there will only be one Reggie until the paper is destroyed. ","1443658243"

Take a look at this album, which is a board I'm currently developing: http://imgur.com/a/bC3HK

Note that except for a few limited cases, I don't have pins connected to each other directly - I name the net and put a label on it.  Doing this would clear up all of the criss-crossing nets that you have in your schematic.

The board's nowhere near done, but you can see that I have already designated a ""gap"".  **No traces may cross this gap!**  The only thing allowed to cross the gap is a part which is rated for the required isolation voltage (looks like ~ 300VDC for yours).  You'll notice that I'm even using a 5v-5v isolated switching regulator to send 5v across the gap while maintaining isolation.

I can see on your board that there are locations that look like they're supposed to be an isolation gap, but then you have one or two traces across the gap.  That's not allowed (and is generally dangerous).

Let me know if you have any more questions :)","1443658244"

Maybe you have some programs that are screwing up your phone. Plus you said your gps doesn't work. I would have sent it in immediately because that is not a known issue with the Note 4.

There are trade offs with the iphone as well. You just need to experience other phones to realize how good we have it with a fully functioning Note 4. There's very little improvement with recent Google updates and they break a lot of stuff. This isn't a carrier problem, the base OS is a big problem lately.

"food","t5_2qh55","Reminds me of my final project in the business school I was in.  Accountants, finance, and marketing students had to take part of a thing like you described but we were paired with engineers who were trying to solve a problem.  Was supposed to get everyone prepared for the real world. 
...
...
That was the day I looked around and saw every future business graduate in this university lose total respect for engineers.  ""I hear you, but can you just forget about NPV for second?"" was my favorite quote as I was finance, risk analysis/equities tracking, followed by ""But we are technically a 'business', so let's just get more debt.  It doesn't affect us since we are a business, it's not like a real person loan.  We can just keep getting debt until it's profitable"".

What's funny is after working in equities for 5 years I went back to school and got a second bachelors in CS.  I then had tech companies doing everything but sucking my dick to try and work for them because I was an ""engineer who knew how the real world worked"".

So in short - welcome to the circle of life.  Someone out there thinks you're an idiot no matter what your background is, so quit being a snobby stuck up asshole who hates people because of what they do. ","1443658248"

There's a problem with the sync in the transmission for first and reverse because I think the previous owner didn't know how to use a manual well but I know how to use it without letting that cause any problems.

I'm looking at about $600 for a BHR ignition system before mine goes bad. The cat was replaced via warranty with the last owner.  If I could describe how well my car runs I would.  

That being said there's a chance for parts to fail and I'm eventually going to rebuild it because I don't know how well the previous owner kept the carbon out.  When I do that though, I'm putting way better seals and adding an oil reservoir for specialised two stroke oil that keeps it running much smoother and keep carbon out of it.  I have no worries whatsoever about the life of my engine.  Even if I have issues, it has three moving parts. The hardest part is getting all the other parts off the engine to get inside.

Yes, they pretty much say there's nothing to do but sit and wait (their actual words).

Also, I'm of the opinion that $50 million dollars in legal costs (as with the Philip Morris case) for an unsuccessful suit is a very powerful deterrent for governments to question the will of corporations. Do you disagree?

There's no reason to believe, given that massive corporations (with huge legal departments) thought it was a good idea to sue, that these cases will be unsuccessful. Even if they were, these suits are clearly incredibly powerful tools for corporations to use to change government opinion away from taxpayer benefits. Do you disagree?","1443658251"

If you get wax on unwanted parts of skin, use baby oil to get it off. Not sure how or why, but it works. 

If you're having trouble with leftover wax after you rip, your wax wasn't hot enough. And if your skin is just too sensitive and you can't handle super hot wax, apply powder to whatever area you're going to wax before hand. It makes the wax stick to the hair and not the skin so much. ","1443658252"

Let me rephrase my previous comment. I'm giving the pedestrian and the driver as much respect as they gave road safety.

I'm not going to curl up into a ball, cry a little before giving them Facebook Likes/Prayers as an attempt to make me... sorry, them, feel better. It's 100% their fault.

LOL! Yes, she's been assessed a few pre-slip penalties. At the trial this month I was trying out new equipment and slipped with the leash. The jackets I got were also a disaster and came loose half way around the course and she lost points for that, too. I might suggest the $5 penalties for a party fund. Good idea!

You guys got married when you were very, very young. I'm not sure what kind of wedding you had, but how about you have a wedding vow renewal ? With a Celebrant, a Dress, a Ring and a Party :) Reconfirm your marriage to each other - how much you love each other and have grown together.

You're totally right about the pre-judgements and stereotypes.

So I shouldn't call *you* a douchebag for vaping.  I'm just tired of the Rutabega Jr's of the world who blow clouds in public then tell people not to get mad because its harmless or doesn't smell bad.

It effects me even more because I have such a hair-trigger on my personal space. 

So if we ever run into each other, we can sit on the couch and watch some BoJack, and you can vape and I'll rant.  We'll order pizza and falafel.

* I didn't know the biggest bailout in UK history up to 2009 was to compensate slave owners for the loss of their ""property"". 

* I didn't know that the freed slaves had to pay for their liberty for four years with 45 hours per week of unpaid work for their owners.

* I didn't know that 40% of owners were women.

* I didn't know that as many as 46,000 British citizens owned slaves. That's a lot.

* I didn't know that the bailout money was 40% of all money spent by the government in 1834.

* I didn't know that Orwell's great-grandfather was a slave owner and was compensated for the loss of his slaves.

I of course have always known about British slavery, I just never knew what was involved in the freeing of those slaves. 

Just because I found this interesting enough to post, doesn't mean I don't care to know more about those 500,000 child slaves in Haiti. Feel free to direct me to articles on that if you have time. 

And no need to fly off the handle. It's a post. I see all kinds of shit posted here, but I honestly don't think there's anything shitty about this article. I learned something. Maybe someone else will too.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","It's ILLEGAL to use your gun in an event of a burglary unless you a) can't run away and b) you are directly threatened by the attacker and c) you're sure your attacker has a gun (proportionality law - you can't shoot someone who is coming at you with a small knife) and even then you're going to have a tough time in court. Also after you shoot the burglar you are required by law to give first aid.

This is very, very rare. Like 2012 rare (edit: that's the most recent case I can find). There are no ""home invasions"". In the off chance that burglars break in while you're at home (which they don't want to do, since a) you can see them and b) it legally opens a can of worms if you threaten someone) they leave prettty quickly.

There is NO stand your ground or castle schmancy doctrine. Someone wants to steal your stuff, you LEAVE. Someone is all up in your face in the club, you GO AWAY. De-escalation is the key to everything. Call the police once you're out of the situation.

Guns have a different connotation here. In some rural areas in Switzerland guns are also seen as protection. This view is steeped in tradition (hence we still have a militia): it's a protection of ""Switzerland, of ""Swiss values"", the smallest increment of this is the community.

&gt;Rationally, I shouldn't rely on faith in others. I know better. I still do it though.

At least you know that people coming through is a thing that can exist; it is within the realm of possibilities in this world. You have likely witnessed a person coming through for you, at least once, so you do know it exists, it is not just a fantasy. You have no such evidence that a supernatural being exists, ever has, or ever will.

&gt;So whatever they ""love"" and whatever I ""love"" about someone else is something that cannot be proven

The idea that love appears not grounded in reality is why I remain sceptical of it, and I would agree that it requires a similar kind of faith to believing in the supernatural. However, it is a known human experience that practically everyone will attest to. And ultimately, we will one day either discover it to be a mere delusion (like feelings of supernatural presences) or as a legitimate chemical reaction and function within the brain/body.","1443658262"

Drawing on more than six hundred local histories from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, Jean M. O’Brien explores how these narratives inculcated the myth of Indian extinction, a myth that has stubbornly remained in the American consciousness.""


Ok so this is a fairly recent book about Native Americans that i picked up this summer for a project im working on at work.  If you actually read it I think it will give you a great new perspective on the native population.  You will also notice a stark difference between this and diamonds work.

A historical monograph is a serious thing to write.  You cant just pop in your opinions or carry along a chain of what ifs.  When you write from a position of expertise and authority on a historical issue you have to understand that your opinion will become a part of future research.  This pop history movement is something that is affecting the general populations perception of many historical events in a negative way.  I'm sure you know the television version of this is found on the History channel.  While most people know the alien shows are just for fun and not a serious theory, many viewers do not understand that most of the ""real"" history specials on the History channel are just as contrived.  Those super patriotic Americas beginning  shows are absolutely made to just draw an audience.  If they need to fudge some facts here or there it will be done.

Im sorry i dont have a copy of GGS anymore, i gave it one read and tossed it out.  I have a deeply personal connection to this field, and i cant stand it when people throw together these over the top end-all-be-all books that claim to answer huge questions that others have spent their lives researching small parts of.

From what I remember, a large part of the book is based on the success of agriculture and livestock in some areas.  His documentation of his research is weakest here even though it was a huge part of one of his many wild thesis's.  Theres also a ton of racist undertones when he refers to different populations.  

Its not up to me to disprove someones scholarly work.  Everyone should assume its crap if the author himself cant bother to fully document where he is getting his ideas.  ","1443658263"

Then again, when comparing something like a laptop to a violin the question becomes more complex and in the end, you might even start thinking that hey - maybe for someone the one-sound synth produces more emotions than a laptop or a violin ever will and thus, the issue might just feel like a moot point.

If we assume that it *is* a thing that's ""measurable"" it's interesting to play with the traditional notions.

Early in their stay at Winterfell, Bran mentions that he'd love to visit Greywater, and iirc one of the Reeds suggests that they go visit immediately. So if the plan was ""go get Bran and bring him to Greywater,"" it wasn't very risky from Howland's point of view. The north wasn't all that dangerous at the beginning of ACOK.

I'm not blaming or wallowing.^1 I'm pointing out that this ""good economy"" is very localized. It's limited mostly to the cohort that grew up when education was cheap, when houses were cheap and when minimum wage more closely resembled a living wage. They have retirement savings, investments, property or pensions. These are most of the folks who think the economy is tickety-boo.

1 - In fact, as far as young people go, I'm doing alright. I'm still deep in debt with student loans and can't consider saving for retirement yet, but I consider myself quite fortunate. I have a job that challenges me and pays me a living wage. I can generally buy healthy, nutritious food and have a safe place to lay my head at night.

I'm just a little bitter because everytime something is vegan friendly, it's a cash grab.

What's wrong with a positive role model who's female and brown and endorses education rather than shoving cheesy pop records down kids' throats? Symbols are potent; they have a very real value.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like while you are happy to admit that there are certain aspects of Niki Minaj's persona and public front that are in line with feminism and women's rights, there are also (mainly regarding sexualization/objectification of a woman's body, and self image) that are not in line. So for the sake of this argument, I would focus on those two points you seemed to bring up in your original argument. 

Point 1: Niki does not promote feminist values because she sexualizes herself just for the sake of men's approval. (i.e. the Anaconda video)

First I think you would need to recognize that there is a difference between a man sexualizing a woman and a woman sexualizing herself. When a man sexualizes another, they are objectifying that person. They are ignoring all of the many and varied characteristics that normally compose a person, and value this person's worth on just one. However, when a woman sexualizes herself, she is choosing what she wants emphasized about herself in that particular setting. She is putting forth what she wants to be recognized for in that moment. This is different then when a man does it because it's her own body, and she gets to control the message. 

If you wanted to focus on the part of the argument that she is only sexualizing herself for the sole purpose of pleasing a man, then I would tell you to take a close look at the lyrics, ignoring the video for the moment. Essentially, Niki took a song about objectifying one aspect of a woman's body, and parodied it to sexualize men. It's takes away the power that a man had by sexualizing the woman, and giving it to her, saying, look at what my big booty body can make you do for me. Instead of a woman's body being at the mercy for men's judgement or use, it is now a tool for a woman to use, and therefore empowering. Just because it can be used to gain a man's attention, doesn't mean that is it's sole purpose. And I think this is what the video tries to capture. It kind of shows how a woman can control how little or how much she allows herself to be seen as a sexual being.

Point 2: She shames skinny girls.

I think this might be your strongest point, and one I'll have the hardest time arguing against. The most I can say about it, is using the classic (and seems to be reddit's favorite) argument that because skinny, or average body types have an advantage, they cannot as easily be oppressed. This is a weak argument though, seeing as feminism embraces all body types and argues against any body shaming. You might be able to argue that it is not shaming, just empowering to those more full bodied women, but this is very weak. 

Point 3: Because her body was surgically modified, her confidence is artifical.

Well this is a flawed look. If you've ever had braces, they artificially straighten your teeth, making your smile prettier, and therefore you more confident in showing it off. Is that confidence you feel any less real then confidence you get from wearing a well fitting outfit, or having a good hair day? It doesn't matter what/how something makes you feel confident. If the feeling is there, then it's genuine. How can you tell whether or not having those modifications didn't actually improve her self-image? I don't like my hair when it gets too long so I cut it. Is that telling other girls that because I changed it, I'm no longer a feminist? ","1443658269"

The very large bottles of gas essentially had a shotgun shell positioned in their neck to blow a seal out laterally so the bottles could empty very very fast and suppress the fire.

In this case the system was being serviced and a tech over-tightened a screw on an alarm pull, it broke and caused a discharge into our 5,000 sq foot server room. Dropped power too of course as there is an interconnect so that the power is dropped after a few seconds allowing the Halon to be pulled into the equipment via fans.

The good news was they had to pay the expensive cost to refill the system.

EDIT: The gas is is distributed via pipes and dispersion heads below the raised floor and from above near the ceiling as well. The charge just opens a valve allowing the gas to flow into distribution pipes. We had two bottles each about the size of 5 Oxy tanks if they were banded together. Our smaller spaces were protected with hemispherical tanks. Eventually built a new room with a dry pipe water system. Water held out of the pipes above the room via air pressure. Pressure would be released if fire detected. Immediate power kill in that room of course. ","1443658271"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","This is gonna get a bit essay-ish so get ready: 

Asari and salarians have definitely lost a lot of influence; after the extent of their government's lies (the Prothean beacon on Thessia, the attempted Genophage sabotage) and their general resistance to aid in the war effort nobody trusts them anymore and they'll probably be on the receiving end of some harsh investigation. Add in Thessia getting sacked by the Reapers and it's likely that, in the immediate aftermath, humans and turians will likely be the predominant powers in the galaxy for some time.

The quarians will probably get to live down their bad reputation a bit now that the admirals don't have them bumming about the galaxy and mooching off other governments. The admiralty board will likely be disbanded in favor of a different governmental system or at least have it's membership changed heavily, given that the incompetence and rashness of several admirals got the Flotilla bogged down fighting the geth when the Reapers came and nearly got it wiped out entirely. If the geth are alive and at peace with the quarians than they'll probably also gain some acceptance amongst society. Quarian and geth relations will probably build up slowly but become really strong since they're basically sharing a homeworld.

The krogan are a bit of a wild card in the post-Reaper galaxy. If the Genophage wasn't cured than they're gonna slowly die out over the course of several generations unless they adapt to it again. If cured with Wrex and Eve in charge, they'll probably slowly build themselves up into a more stable society and are in shape to become a major player in galactic politics, especially with the asari and salarians on the recline for the moment. If cured with Wreav in charge though it will basically just end in Krogan Rebellions mk. 2, only this time galactic society will probably be a lot less forgiving.

The batarian hegemony is just done for. Either a new batarian government arises to unite them or they become a very fractured race with lots of tiny polities scattered about the galaxy. The less powerful races (elcor, hanar, volus, vorcha, drell, etc.) are more or less in the same position they were before, assuming their governments stayed up after the chaos of the Reaper War. The yahg are basically just chilling on their home planet, completely unaware of what's going on.

Galactic society is getting a good tech boost thanks to everything they've salvaged from the now dead or friendly Reapers. Socially there's probably a newfound focus on unity and equality amongst the various races since that basically won the war. Existing synthetic life is accepted but the creation of AI is still heavily regulated. ","1443658273"

All those episodes in which the crew of the Enterprise travel to 20th century Earth might happen differently in the new timeline, thus causing strange things like human culture being stuck in the hedonistic selfishness of the early 21st century, people building starships in Iowa instead of the Utopia Planitia shipyards, the poor disciplinary system of Starfleet, Chekov being born 4 years early, and Archer still being alive and hale at the age of 145 years old. On the other hand, this does not explain stuff like calling T'Khut ""Delta Vega"" or how a transporter can beam someone across systems.

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","&gt;&gt; (Jetshockeyfan) It's cool, but frankly it's something I'd expect from this and the Model S. Everything in the class that I can think of has similar filtration systems, they just haven't advertised it like this. This is why Tesla gets compared to Apple so much.

&gt; (forgotmyredditagain: @Jetshockeyfan) you know, every time you post i try not to downvote you. it's an effort i make because i think everyone is entitled to their opinion even if i disagree with it. (you're entitled to your own opinion, though, not your own facts -- this isn't fox news) sometimes you even have a valid point. and then you spout some complete and utter bullshit like this, which is definitively incorrect, lacks even the simplest of let-me-google-that-research, and reeks of corporate fanboyism, and i question why i bother even replying.
do you get paid to do this? is your life so infinitely unfulfilling that you have to disagree with facts on a forum for the negative attention it nets you? i am genuinely curious. i legitimately do not understand. what's the point?

You're not the only one that wonders as I've heard the same from others users I asked for opinions of Jets.  I've liked a some of his contributions, other times he drives me up the wall \*facepalm\*.  Sometimes, I almost wish he had to put a $1000 deposit for each blanket unqualified statement, and risk losing it if proven wrong whenever he's casting negative aspersions on Tesla (he basically likes dropping bombs like the quote above)  Although, I'm by no means faultless (I make mistakes too); I do try to make efforts to qualify statements --as I've seen Jets do on rare occasion now too \*yay!\*-- I must admit I sometimes have irritated negative bias toward old auto companies (that had disappointed me so many times) --Fool me twice, etc--.

I almost get impression that on occasion he tries to diminish, badmouth or give the most pessimistic skeptical interpretation of Tesla's products, behavior, (or damning with faint praise), ad nauseum.  But, he also knows a ton about cars so it's enlightening hearing his perspective.  He's on occasion a [MagnificentBastard](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard) and (amusingly)[WorthyOpponent](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent); I'm curious if he's an [EnigmaticMinion](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnigmaticMinion); he _definitely_ has [~~TautologicalTemplar~~](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar)[\*Fundamentalist\*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist) tendencies and suffers from being [ObliviouslyEvil](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil) while [BelievingTheirOwnLies] (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies) and [Doublethink](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleThink) or is a [PunchClockVillain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain) is the allegation I heard; but evidence would be huge undertaking and I'm not thrilled w/a witchhunt --*LoL* if only NSA did Reddit freebies *LoL*.  

I've had very interesting conversations w/him, and his arguments sometimes had somewhat reasonable logic *if* one assumed his values; it's just that his values mis-match with numerous/majority of people here, so that leads to lots of disagreements such that his arguments often come out as [InsaneTrollLogic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic) (sometimes it is insane-ish); he just doesn't know it; he thinks he's right.  His refrain from personal-attacking makes him also [AffablyEvil](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil).  Others and I wonder if he's taking advantage of [Brandolini’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit)(BS Asymmetric Principle)(which would be diabolical) or he is conditioned to use negative framing.

I said if he wants people to trust him more he should write more positive comments; lol did I encourage a monster?  I don't regret publicly defending him yet, but he sure gives me a huuuuge headache sometimes LoL.  Just hoping he's not a troll.  He kind of plays [XanatosSpeedChess](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess) due to his extraordinarily quick responses that require way more overhead to respond to sometimes (and switches from attack to attack, or defense to backup defense quickly).  I wonder if he ever admits fault unless it's furthering his aim.

He also frequents auto threads and speaks as one intimately abreast of auto stuff (and car racing) so he offers enlightening perspectives.  I would be lying if I said I was not _significantly_ impressed by his knowledge more than once.  A few of his descriptions on his ranking of auto categories (although totally clashing with mine, and US/UK legal specifications) at least had a beautiful self symmetry that I admired and would have possibly taken had I been in his position (and incidentally shared his values).

[Edit1: XanatosSpeedChess link fixed; typos]

[Edit2: TautologicalTemplare crossed out as it was more example of TheFundamentalist, BelievingTheirOwnLies and DoubleThink; Added addendum extolling the self symmetry of one of his perspectives / heuristic for ranking cars, (although both I and the law disagree with his standard); but it was nice nonetheless.]

But if you attack him again once you respawn, that debuff keeps refreshing on you.  The debuff prevents him from enraging, which is what kills you when you don't have the debuff.

The only downside is that he will then interrupt you every 5 seconds, but... that's a small price to pay to kill him.","1443658276"

"ProgrammingLanguages","t5_2qi8m","The ""[type]"" array declaration syntax looks a little confusing, like typecasting ""(type)"".

  [int] A = new [int][]50;
  A[3] = (int)""test"";

Right ?

The built-in ""list"" and ""map"" idea sounds good.

Are your ""list"" types indexed, or just ""first-in-first-out"" ?

Then, they are more like ""dynamic arrays"" (Not max. size defined).

Anyway a ""type!"" or ""type+"" list seems less confusing with an array.

  int! A = new int!();
  A != 0; // add an item
  A != 77; // add an item
  A != -3; // add an item

  int+ A = new int+();
  A += 0; // add an item
  A += 77; // add an item
  A += -3; // add an item

Your map ""[key:value]"" ideas sounds fine, altought a ""type[key:value]"" does not seems bad.

  [int:string] A = new [int:string]();
  A += [1:""sun""]; // add an item
  A += [2:""mercury""]; // add an item
  A += [3:""venus""]; // add an item
  A += [4:""earth""]; // add an item
  A += [5:""mars""]; // add an item

  A[int:string] = new [int:string]();
  A += [1:""sun""]; // add an item
  A += [2:""mercury""]; // add an item
  A += [3:""venus""]; // add an item
  A += [4:""earth""]; // add an item
  A += [5:""mars""]; // add an item

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","I think you might have set the bar a little high. We could fairly easily say that games can be as-or-more complex than *movies*. But an English prof is knee-deep in works from some of the most brilliant and creative minds that ever lived. And those minds were able to control nearly all parts of their craft.

There really haven't been any games that are as complex as *Hamlet* or *Nineteen Eighty-Four* or *To Kill a Mockingbird* in terms of straight-up use of symbolism or narrative or other literary elements. It's not really a fair fight, so to speak.

The reason why video games are art is because of the sum total of elements that come together to make the game. *The Last of Us* is a metaphor for the fallibility of man in the face of sentiment, but narrative-wise, it's pretty uncomplex. However, the fact that the player must face adversity with his companion, and is personally affected (and attacked) by the world and its denizens contributes overwhelmingly to the overall experience of the game itself.

*Alan Wake* uses a ton of literary and filmic elements to get the job done, but relies on its own use of its medium to be a successful work. It's unnerving because the player feels in danger due to the game mechanics, and these are accepted due to ""suspension of disbelief"" created by other narrative elements. As a contemplation of the nature of art and creativity it's somewhat superficial, but as an *experience* it's profound.

tl;dr abandon your ""just as complex, literarily"" angle, and instead try ""contain elements of literature, coupled with use of the medium"", just like a play or film does (i.e. *Waiting for Godot* would make a mediocre novel because it's just dialogue).","1443658277"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Hello,

Thanks very much for your thoughtful reply!  This is very helpful, and I appreciate your time.

Dating is relatively new for me.. to be honest.  I was married for almost 17 years to the first girlfriend I ever had, and I never even held hands with a girl before I met her.  So I've not had a lot of experience starting and ending relationships.  

On top of that, I've found I tend to ""fall in love"" easily... I mean, I can very easily see myself being with most of the women I've dated.  The only thing stopping me was the physical stuff... because right now, I still feel that's really important for me.  It's difficult though, because I know the women I've had to ""break up with"" were very much into me, and it fills me with guilt knowing that I had to hurt them.  However, I realize I can't stay with someone just because I feel too guilty to break up with them... but it still is difficult and I still feel awful each time it happens.  (Especially if we've been flirting together, or more, and I feel really bad for then letting them down.)

That's why I am now so hesitant to go out again with this latest woman.  She's really nice, and we hit it off well together... but she's not the physical type I really want... ..  she's... ""almost""... ""kind of""...  and so I am having a difficult time asking her out again, flirting, etc...  and thus leading her on...  only to maybe eventually let her down if the physical attraction doesn't eventually really happen for me.

What I mean is that she is ""good enough""... she's certainly not unattractive... but she isn't really what I wanted in my mind or envision as what I want (need?).  She's just... ok.

I'm probably way overthinking all of this, though.  

&gt;&gt; if you meet someone and they maybe don't trip all your triggers at the very outset, do NOT expect that someone is going to change.

This is excellent advice.  I spent a long time in my marriage hoping and expecting my wife to change.  (And I tried to change myself, once I realized she would never change...)  It just postponed the inevitable, and we wasted many more years than were necessary... and it produced more heartache that could have been avoided.  People don't change.  I need to remember that when I am thinking about this stuff now.  Thanks for the reminder!

&gt;&gt; maybe examine yourself (like maybe submit your profile to be critiqued and get an objective opinion) 

Hey, can I ask you a favor?  Can you help me with this?  I have no idea where to get my profile to be critiqued.  (I understand if you say no, as it would be awkward to explain to your husband why you're looking at some random guys profile and pictures...)  However, I would be tremendously grateful if you would be willing to take a look at my profile and tell me your honest and objective opinion!

Either way... thanks again!  :)","1443658280"

But I doubt he specifically agrees with elected government officials to start applying their beliefs in direct contradiction to the law. I think, regardless of how people feel about him or religion in general, he is a reasonable enough human being to suggest someone in that situation should simply step down from their position and get a job that does not put them in a position to decide between upholding their strong religious beliefs or breaking the law.

Maybe that's not the case but his quote without more context does not itself imply (to me) that he thinks she was right to maintain her position as a clerk and continue to deny marriage certificates instead of just resigning and doing something else to avoid the problem in the first place.","1443658282"

Let's say your grandmother has a $1M retirement account. Let's say even futher that she redistributes all of those funds yearly, meaning she sells $1M of stock and buys $1M or stock at an average price of $25. That means she sells about 40000 shares and buys about 40000 shares for a total of 80000 transactions. Considering that the profit per transaction in HFT market making is on the order of tenths of a penny, that means your millionaire grandmother pays HFT firms about 80 bucks a year.

Interestingly, another user mentioned how Canada curbed HFT and spreads increased by about 9%, for most stocks: this also translates to about a tenth of a penny, so on average you grandmother would have paid roughly the same amount in wider spreads if HFT market makers exited the market.

I was an HFT trader at a major firm. I don't love it. I think it is a monumental waste of time that is mostly harmless. I wish markets were structured in a way that didn't encourage the massive amount of time and money spent on such a useless activity, but frankly that isn't as easy as it sounds.","1443658283"

At the same time will any conservatives praise this as papal approval while ignoring climate change reality and immigrant plight? It works both ways. 

I think what turns people off about this move is not his stance against gay marriage, which is more than expected, but whom he chose to talk to. It only contributes to her martyrdom she is clearly embracing. And she was not being persecuted. Even many Christians agree on that. /r/Christianity is cringing at this.

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; Having a single OS unifying all devices is simply more feasible for developers. 

How? Each of those devices have different UI/UX requirements. How do you design one App for both touch input and mouse input? 

Microsoft has not solved this with Windows 10. The UI is still a mishmash of different modalities. 

&gt;It also allows the companies to concentrate on ""The OS"" rather than dividing their attention between the needs of the mobile division and the needs of the desktop division. 

You are assuming that the core of the OS is not common between the two already. AFAIK, iOS and MacOS X share the same kernel etc already. The User facing SDKs, Frameworks and APIs are different due to one been optimized for touch and the other for pointer input.  

&gt;  One system means one development team for one product.

Only in some utopia where all hardware is then same. The minute you have devices and device drivers there is no such thing as one team on product.

"shittyaskscience","t5_2sw51","I think I have quite a unique belief actually, and yes more a-religious. To clarify I believe in an infinite number of realities, over an infinite span of time. If believe that all must exist within infinity even paradoxes. So in one reality a man named Jesus walked the Earth helping people and teaching people how to live better more meaningful lives, and was crucified at the end of his life. In another reality the Nephites of the Book of Mormon crossed the sea to North America, in another reality all the Norse gods exist, and in another reality it was created merely by a big bang.

Imagine realities as computer servers loaded with universes you can inhabit. Each server can have its own stories, peoples, places, laws of physics, Gods, etc etc. That is how I view the world we live in. We are three dimensional beings in a three dimensional physics type of ""computer"".

Ever read Flatland? If you haven't and are interested here is the full movie version of it on youtube: [Flatland: The Film (2007)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyuNrm4VK2w)

Explaining the scenario in the movie, the main character is a 2-Dimensional being who lives in a literal flat planet. The characters must sense each other by moving back and forth on their plane to ""infer"" the shapes of each other.

Eventually a 3-Dimensional being appears to the main character as at first a voice seemingly coming from nowhere. The 3-D being at first tries to explain to the main character what 3-D is but is having trouble making him believe, so eventually he uses his vastly superior technology to extract him from Flatland, and point him down to see it for himself. They travel through 3-D for a bit and the 2-D main character goes through quite an enlightening experience learning about the new dimension.

I believe that we are 3-D beings and that there are 4-D and 5-D and even higher beings who can watch us at any given moment. I believe that they are inherently better than us, they are more ""full"" so to speak, and that they guide us around with inspiration because as a 3-D being can see the inside of a 2-D being, touching its organs, so a 4-D being can ""see"" inside of us and touch us. That conscious voice in your head to do good things could quite literally be another person in a higher dimension giving you inspiration by using superior technology to stimulate parts of your brain. 

I know I know... it's quite the belief system. Why and how would I come to believe such a thing? [Through experience.](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/3kor2c/first_contact_a_spiritual_experience/)

So in closing, Yes I believe in an Abrahamic God, but yes I am more a-religious. I believe in miracles, I believe in evolution and if I am to stay true to my beliefs outlined above, there isn't much for me to not believe.

As a person I am generally happy, carefree, and caring and compassionate, traits that I feel have only become stronger since my experience(linked above).

Thanks for taking the time to read my **opinion.** :D

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","Used Themis and completed 92% of the course: 

1) Despite feeling shitty after the MBE, I ended up scoring a 160. I averaged about 70% correct on Themis. As far as coverage, Themis focused a lot more on mortgages than the MBE. 

2) My essays were usually around 60% and I scored a 155 on the UBE essay/mpt portion. I'll say this, there wasn't a single subject that was covered on the exam that I couldn't write an answer for. I'm sure I missed small points but overall I felt confident on the essays because I at least could set up an argument for all of them. Definitely make sure to make time for the MPTs while you review. 

3) Having the ability to self-study was great. I can't imagine making it through those long classes that other programs utilize. I prefer setting my own pace/schedule. 

4) Price was determinative for me. I paid $1100 while my peers were more than twice that amount. With my financial situation it definitely was a nice incentive. 

5) Overall I recommend their program. I don't think anyone was more or less prepared than me, so cost is what I think sets Themis apart.

And I was from a poorer side of town than most people in the class, so I made the joke that I ""was from the streets"". I am not. Well, long story short in our meeting, the first question was ""tell me about yourself"". Well I told her where I was from. However No one told me my boss' boss had no sense of humor.

"FocusST","t5_2unrr","I'll answer this one for you direct!
I love the EFR turbo, and I may be a little biased because its what I run :)

The EFR generally has a wider map than a comparable Garrett, which means in some cases, they can be a better fit throughout the rev range. Their spool advantage (and fragility) comes from the alloyed exhaust wheel (an alloy known as ""Gamma Ti"" (titanium aluminide)). This alloy is similarly used in jet engine turbines by Rolls Royce and General Electric for example.

The alloy is more brittle, which means it doesn't take kindly to being pushed passed its maximum rated speed (the line on the right side of the compressor map), or being hit by anything. If you push it too hard and the forces get too high on it, or something hits it, it will shatter into a million little pieces.

That same lightness though, gives you a spool advantage (and a price tag!) So your bottom end can have more boost. Top end is really determined by which size compressor you go with. The smaller 6258 for example is stressed much past 375whp. The largest 7163 I think is a good choice for a 500-550ish whp build. All of them will maintain boost unlike stock.

GTX doesn't mean you'll lose, but the 6758 that he has is really a golden turbo  for this engine. It spools incredibly quick, and can flow well into the 400s. A comparable GTX is the 2867 or 2971.
Both will net you similar straight line performance. The spool benefit is a hard one to judge, but honestly, the 2867 spools plenty quick to take B0bD0le out, and that extra spool likes to go into wheelspin and sucking fuel out of the already stressed fuel system down low. 

I really love the EFR, and for me, it was worth the money and wait, but to be honest, the GTX is more horsepower per dollar, and at the end of the day, that's an important metric to consider as well!

Thanks,
Steve

Since the problems with NAFTA there have been a large number of changes mostly to keep these negotiations outside of the public eye.  

This is not normal it is a response to the fact that people do not like these treaties because they do not represent perhaps the most important stake holder in all this which is the common citizen that will be most affected by these decisions.  It is clear negotiators do not care to entertain this position and thus are creating a treaty with unacceptable negative externalities that they refuse to account for.

But she doesn't seem to want that space anymore. At this point in our relationship, we're doing all of the things regular bfs and gfs do, but without the label.

Take Break Ya Neck by Busta Rhymes.  Within the first verse he goes from complimenting an individual for his/her (undefined) enthusiasm for music and dance.  He then randomly switches to addressing a crowd, telling them about his prowess as a musician.  Then he turns to encouraging enthusiasm and demanding loyalty that potentially extends to mortal violence.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","That's pretty much it; simpler champions are normally easier to balance, given the lack of complexity in their kits. Typically all you need to do is tune numbers by basing it on general results to balance it out with other champions. It's harder to accurately nerf more complex champions like Zed, Ekko, Irelia, etc. because of how much is put into each skill, including the passive.

However, for Annie's case, her passive is something that plays an absolutely huge role in how she's played. If you look at her balance history, it's full of nerfs stemming all the way from Season 3. The only thing that can be considered a buff is lowering her base damages and giving her higher scalings (weakening her early game and buffing her late game), and this was done because Support Annie became a huge thing once the Chinese pros took her to Worlds. Despite all these nerfs, she's still a very prevalent and popular pick, due to both her simplicity and her relevance due to that passive.

Utility is something that is relevant at every stage of the game, no matter how ahead or behind you are. This is why champions that usually have a lot of utility (Nautilus, Lissandra, Maokai) have low base damages and scalings to balance them out. They trade up snowball potential to remain relevant in terms of utility, unlike champions such as LeBlanc or Master Yi with little to no utility that rely completely on damage, and scale incredibly hard with items. If Maokai or Lissandra fall behind, they can both contribute to the team with utility, but wouldn't snowball nearly as hard as Leblanc or Yi. There's a tradeoff through risk and reward here.

However, Annie is able to not only claim the best of both worlds, but is also is also incredibly mechanically easy to play. She has no linear skill shots to miss; her two big AoE abilities are more or less instant cast leaving very little room for outplay (compared to Ori and Cass ults). One can't even argue that she needs to get into close range to deal damage, because her damage is so easy to land and has a strong stun it doesn't really matter; she can delete someone or win the fight before they get a chance to retaliate. If she gets ahead, her scalings allow her to delete multiple champions. If she's behind, she still has a 1.25-1.75 second AoE OR large ranged point and click stun. Her playstyle also lacks little depth, meaning most of the results come from the player's strategical choices rather than his or her mechanical skill.

tl;dr - Annie's passive is problematic because it gives her too much without carrying a lot of risk.","1443658305"

Let's be real: sooner or later, Bruce is going to be Batman again, and he's probably going to come back via the memory shaper thing that's part of his half-finished cloning device, and he'll likely have his memories up to the moment where he started out as Batman, so that memory is going to become *very* fresh soon; which means his approach to guns here probably won't be shared with his other self.","1443658305"

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","Hmm, looking at the Japanese version of the game I think perhaps its slightly different.

In the Japanese version of the game it is 打刀（うちがたな）and that first character ""打"" is ""strike, hit"". So its more likely to be ""striking sword/katana"" but according to my coworker its more likely to mean ""katana forged by striking"". I think you may have mistaken it for 内?

Also in the Japanese version of the game, the Iaito is 居合い刀（いあいとう）which is literally just ""sword for Iai"" (居合 being ""iai"", the art of drawing a sword, killing the opponent in a clean cut, and then sheathing the sword again after).

-edit- [Here is the Japanese wiki.](http://www.kouryakubo.com/darksouls/C5E1.html) Its the one that all those super detailed Japanese maps originate from.

source: Coworker is born and raised Japanese, I just married a Japanese woman and live here in Japan with her. I'm usually wrong about this kind of stuff but have a vested interest. My coworker though is more trustable.

-Double edit- Ok we solved the mystery of the meaning of 打刀！It's long and crazy so sit down. But at least we can put this behind us:

According to [this article on wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%89%93%E5%88%80) and [this one on ""nakago""](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8C%8E_(%E5%88%80)) (for some reason that last parenthesis wont become part of the link; you need to put it there in the URL manually), an Uchigatana is a katana that, when sheathed and the cutting blade is facing downwards, the characters engraved in the metal that makes up the tang  (usually hidden with a wooden grip) are facing outwards, and the blade and thickness have to be a specific length and width, AND the use of the sword must be a specific use (for instance, not for use on horseback). This however is a super overly nuanced definition from a time now lost to all but those who study the art of ancient katana making. To all modern day Japanese people it simply means what we stated above, ""katana forged by striking"". ","1443658305"

"baconreader","t5_2sbiz","I was trying to add to your post stating that not all users could roll back because not all users are rooted.

And the anonymity portion was only due to what you wrote here:

&gt;You're talking about throwing gas in the fire, but look at yourself. You go around and pick people's posts apart looking for a fight. That's you. Whether that's all you'll ever amount to remains to be seen, but I hope it isn't.

I only meant that if you look at *my* history between here and other sites, you'd be able to answer the ""whether that's all you'll ever amount to remains to be seen"", knowing I use the same name on pretty much all my sites. I only try to post when I feel it adds value to something and if you were to check my username at those other forums (not that I'm saying you need to), you'd see that I try to be professional and calm in any of my posts. I had no intention on implying whether or not you are trying to hide anything here.

But, this started because I thought I was adding value to your post, but you obviously didn't think so. That's fine. This is the internet. People will disagree. And I agree that it is certainly people's rights to use their phones how they like. There are benefits to rooting and/or custom ROMs, and there are benefits to staying stock. I've spent many years enjoying custom ROMs on my devices, but I don't flaunt it around. I saw your post as either assuming most have the ability to restore the backup or rubbing it in people's faces that you can and they can't. In my first response, I chose to think it was the former, and in subsequent posts, it seemed to be the latter. I realize now that it was just in response to the ""there will be no turning back"" portion that was posted. Sorry I misunderstood your meaning.","1443658307"

That's a definite improvement over regular soda. I have a Sodastream I use so much that I got an adapter to use paintball cannisters instead of traditional cartridges. So I know the thirst. :)

Anther mixer option is simply juice. By itself it has more calories than Crystal Light or another sugar-free drink mix. However, you can dilute it much more. And everything from it is natural, unlike the mix.

In fact, a slice of orange in sparkling water might be the ideal option. Natural, flavored, fresh. And looks kind of classy if someone sees you drinking it. :)  Or lemon or lime or strawberries or kiwi... Coming straight off soda it might seem underpowered because you've been hammering your taste buds for so long.

Ok, so..regarding Point 1 ""...he was surrounded by people who serve him.."" 
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
I don't believe anyone but Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus) knew that Sidious was the Chancellor.  From the Revenge of the Sith novelization (which was considered canon at the time - not sure if it still is after disney-buyout) Grievous thinks the following:
------------------------------------
""As he entered his customized pod, he reflected that he was, for the first time in his career, violating orders: though he was under strict orders to leave the Chancellor unharmed, Palpatine was about to die alongside his precious Jedi. Then Grievous shrugged, and sighed. What more could he have done? There was a war on, after all. He was sure Lord Sidious would forgive him"" 

source:  file:///C:/Users/Jay/Downloads/Star%20Wars%20Novel%20-%20[Episode%20III]%20-%20Revenge%20of%20the%20Sith%20-%20Matthew.pdf

------------------------------------
 Regarding Points 2 &amp; 5b (.""..some ability to see the future but that is not that good""; ""...Sidious knew Anakin would come at that exact second"")
------------------------------------
""Darth Sidious was highly adept at foreseeing the future, often utilizing the power to see his plots to fruition, ensuring that all would proceed as he had envisioned."" Source: http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious

------------------------------------
Responding to point 3, see my post above yours.  I believe the redirected force lightning either forced Sidious to drop the ruse that he was a normal looking guy, rather than a dark-side corrupted monster; or that he used the opportunity to drop the ruse anyway, and use the attack as an excuse to no longer maintain it.   Think about it - he's not ""scarred"" or ""burned"", his features bear the hallmarks of a sith lord - yellow eyes and all.  The lightning had nothing to do with that.
------------------------------------

------------------------------------
Points 4 &amp; 5a (""...Shatterpoint, vaapad in general...""; ""...Mace defeated Sidious...""  again from the novel 
------------------------------------
""He found a knot of fault lines in the shadow's future; he chose the largest fracture and followed it back to the here and the now— And it led him, astonishingly, to a man standing frozen in the slashed-open doorway. Mace had no need to look; the presence in the Force was familiar, and was as uplifting as sunlight breaking through a thunderhead. The chosen one was here""
 
more...

""Palpatine staggered, snarling, but the blistering energy that loured from his hands only intensified. He fed the power with his pain. ""Anakin!"" Mace called. His voice sounded distant, blurred, as if it came from the bottom of a well. ""Anakin, help me! This is your chance!"" He felt Anakin's leap from the office floor to the ledge, felt his approach behind—And Palpatine was not afraid. Mace could feel it: he wasn't worried at all. 

""Destroy this traitor,"" the Chancellor said, his voice raised over the howl of writhing energy that joined his hands to Mace's blade. ""This was never an arrest. It's an assassination!""

That was when Mace finally understood. He had it. The key to final victory. Palpatine's shatterpoint. The absolute shatter-point of the Sith. The shatterpoint of the dark side itself. Mace thought, blankly astonished, Palpatine trusts Anakin Skywalker...""

------------------------------------
So, Sidious' weakness, his shatterpoint, is that he has put his full trust into Anakin.  The battle isn't between Mace and Sidious.  Mace is just there to play his part in Anakin's fall.  If Sidious fails to turn Anakin, then he fails. 
------------------------------------
More...

""Now Anakin was at Mace's shoulder. Palpatine still made no move to defend himself from Skywalker; instead he ramped up the lightning bursting from his hands, bending the fountain of Mace's blade back toward the Korun Master's face.

Palpatine's eyes glowed with power, casting a yellow glare that burned back the rain from around them. ""He is a traitor, Anakin. Destroy him.""

""You're the chosen one, Anakin,"" Mace said, his voice going  thin with strain. This was beyond Vaapad; he had no strength left to fight against his own blade. ""Take him. It's your destiny.'""

Skywalker echoed him faintly. ""Destiny...""

""Help me! I can't hold on any longer!"" The yellow glare from Palpatine's eyes spread outward through his flesh. His skin flowed like oil, as though the muscle beneath was burning away, as though even the bones of his skull were softening, were bending and bulging, deforming from the heat and pressure of his electric hatred. ""He is killing me, Anakin—! Please, Anaaahhh—""

------------------------------------
Palpatine is turning the lightning back on Mace, even though nothing had visibly changed yet in the fight, only Anakin's arrival.  And yet, despite turning the tide, Palpatine still pleads for help from Anakin.  
------------------------------------
Then: 
""Mace's blade bent so close to his face that he was choking on
ozone. ""Anakin, he's too strong for me—""

------------------------------------
Mace is about to eat his own lightsaber and  admits that the Chancellor is too strong for him.  He needs Anakin's help.  Damn, that doesn't look good for Sidious...umm...

------------------------------------

""Ahhh—"" Palpatine's roar above above the endless blast of
lightning became a fading moan of despair.
The lightning swallowed itself, leaving only the night and the
rain, and an old man crumpled to his knees on a slippery ledge.
""I... can't. I give up. I... I am too weak, in the end. Too old, and
too weak. Don't kill me, Master Jedi. Please. I surrender.""

------------------------------------
Here we go, now Anakin sees Palpatine as helpless again.  No threat.  Why kill him? 
------------------------------------
Victory flooded through Mace's aching body. He lifted his
blade. ""You Sith disease—""

"" Wait—"" Skywalker seized his lightsaber arm with desperate
strength. ""Don't kill him—you can't just kill him, Master—""

------------------------------------
Sidious is loving that Mace is playing right into his hands here. I rewatched this part just now to see Sidious' eyes and small grin as he watches their exchange. 
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
Regarding your point about Mace not being reliant on his lightsaber---
------------------------------------
""Mace thought blankly, Why? And moved his lightsaber toward the fallen Chancellor. Before he could follow through on his stroke, a sudden arc of
blue plasma sheared through his wrist and his hand tumbled away with his lightsaber still in it and Palpatine roared back to his feet and lightning speared from the Sith Lord's hands and without his blade to catch it, the power of Palpatine's hate struck him full on.
He had been so intent on Palpatine's shatterpoint that he'd never thought to look for Anakin's. Dark lightning blasted away his universe. He fell forever.""

------------------------------------
edits: I'm also sorry for spelling and grammar - I'm a few drinks in myself!  
------------------------------------

------------------------------------
further edit/comment:  I also think it's pretty convenient that Sidious ""drops"" his lightsaber after getting kicked.  Is this something a skilled warrior would do?  Hell, in RotJ we see Vader do a backwards somersault after getting kicked, and manages to keep his lightsaber in hand!  Note that this kick and saber drop was right before Anakin showed up.  Sidious knew he needed to push the case that Mace had him defeated, and would try to kill him rather than letting him stand trial.  He couldn't do that as effectively when standing toe-to-toe fighting him.  

----------------------------------------
another edit/comment (sorry) - Regarding Darth Vader picking up Palpatine/Sidious and throwing him to his death...this was the fulfillment of the shatterpoint that Mace had sensed all those years ago.  The Emperor's undoing, and the fulfillment of the prophecy was that Anakin was always meant to slay him.  In that moment - Sith Lord stood against Jedi Master (Anakin) and balanced was restored.  This was the Return of the Jedi.  Luke at this point was lucky to even be considered a padawan in training or talent. 

The Chosen One fulfilled his destiny in that moment, and balance was achieved.

We often here about all these incidents but honestly it's a lot worse in other parts of the world. In India it's often a small group capitalizing on a tragedy and dragging religion into it.

&gt;Healthcare reform has changed this, and now copays must count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. 

That's what I've tried to tell you this whole time, I HAVE gone on the website. I HAVE called and spoken to them and I have gone in person to a representative to ask about it. Every single time I get the runaround and nothing changes. 

By the provisions of the ACA, my husband and I are considered ""covered,"" so we can't get any of the subsidies or plans that would lower costs, even though we [qualify for them by income.](https://www.healthcare.gov/have-job-based-coverage/change-to-marketplace-plan/) There's also the fact that I am disabled, but keep getting denied for SSI, so my husband is the sole breadwinner.

The hospital isn't a good option by a long shot. Their priority is to stabilize and discharge. It also racks up ridiculous amounts of debt which, if you're poor like the women in our hypothetical situation, would destroy their lives. People go bankrupt from medical bills all the time. 

There's also the fact that PP and health departments provide a lot of teenagers with the sex education and contraceptives they need to not get pregnant. We all know teenagers will do it regardless, we might as well make them safe. It's a terrible idea to take that away, especially considering the fact that a good portion of schools offer abstinence-only sex education, which is proven not to reduce rates of STI infection or pregnancy.

"Torontobluejays","t5_2sb61","I was born in '78, one year after the Blue Jays were born. I was taught to be a baseball fan and player, and I was. It's been a religion of sorts, complete with going to games, checking the newspapers, crunching stats, arguing with other fans, screaming ""Dave Winfield sucks pond water!"" at Kauffman Stadium when that future Jay still played for the hated Yankees, and always loving the game, and the Toronto Blue Jays.

When I was a young buck, I enjoyed the excitement and disappointment of '85, and then '87. My early teenage years I enjoyed being the spoiled sports fan who watched those early '90s teams rake and pitch their way to championships. Then came the long, arduous stretch of relative mediocrity. There were still great players to cheer for-- Delgado, Green, Rolen, Halladay, Bautista, Johnny Mac, Snider, Cabrera, and on and on.

One day the ownership told a mediocre GM named J.P. to pack his bags and brought in this bright young kid named Alex, and the writing was on the wall. The word was winning. Consistent winning.

So congratulations to Alex Anthopolous on this day for finally seeing his vision bear fruit. He's earned it, as have all the incredible players on the field right now, and a few who aren't-- Danny V, you're in our hearts man.

All pertinent Security Council decisions are binding on member states, and in the case of UNSC 242, the relevant portion was just re-emphasizing and reminding Israel of what the UN Charter requires.

Because unless the UN is willing to go in and utterly destroy Israel's defensive capability... It's non binding. Unless the UN is willing to Expel Israel over it's non-compliance.

And we can 'what if' any number of scenarios that didn't happen.  Sometimes it's interesting and fun to fill time.

The great thing about racing is that the guys actually have to race.   They score points and at the end of the season, you total the points to find the champion.

There's no judging based on technical difficulty, skill levels or circumstances.  It's the same for everyone with no bias applied.


&gt;  I know I would be pretty pissed off with him

Why would you be pissed off at him?   Marc knows one way to ride.. and that's to win.   Ducati made some progress and Yamaha have made progress that seems to have closed any performance gap to Honda. 

So you could just as easily blame Honda for not delivering a bike that is 'good enough' for Marc's standards of riding to win instead of chasing points.


Best example of where his aggression has paid off is probably Marc's rookie year with the incident at Jerez where he bumped Lorenzo wide in the last corner of the last lap and took 2nd place.

He could have easily settled for 3rd, but he didn't.   That's not what he does. The opportunity was there and he took it.   The difference in points for 2nd and 3rd is 4 points.

As it turns out, Marc won the championship by 4 points.  Had he not made that move and just settled for 2nd, he would not have been champion.   The points would have been tied and Lorenzo would have been champion because he had more wins.

So what if he settled for points now?  He'd probably be lower in the standings this year and not have as many points as he does now without pushing the way he does.","1443658322"

- Get the 695 upgraded baleful gear
- Run Heroic BRF to get yout T17 2/4pc (this won't help your ilevel, but it will help your DPS)
- Get 3x 715-level crafted items
- Buy the boot and belt BoEs from heroic (710) or mythic (725)
- Get your legendary ring to 715
- Kill Kazzak each week, he'll drop 2-3 705 items that are worth having if you don't have anything better

I think a ""me rn"" or ""literally me"" posts or even just any type of post are closer to life events or personality facets that make up a person's identity. While something like a username, fursona, or profile pic are closer to a ""litterally actually me."" 
For example when I think of Dril (@wint) I think of that blurry picture of the guy with sunglasses and the name Dril. But that name and blurry picture are defined by all of the quirky tweets and posts that they have shared. Its the same as how I think about my boyfriend by their name and how they look.

"visualnovels","t5_2r5yf","Oh boy. After finally finishing [eden*](https://vndb.org/v1286), I just couldn't like it. Even though I really wanted to enjoy it, I never got involved with the story.

Even with all the powerful moments, the other parts of the VN couldn't come together to fit the mood. The pacing was slow. Maybe it's my fault and I didn't appreciate the love story, but there were many long stretches of nothing happening, not even exposition, and I found myself checking the time often. In particular, the ""two-act"" segmentation with the military facility and [ ](#s ""the escape on the farm"") felt like there were two separate ideas for how the story should go, but it the end they were simply thrown together. Aside from Ryou and Sion, no other characters spanned both parts and without any real connection, there was a giant division that left the focus of the story unclear.

But even if that was smoothed out, the characters weren't particularly compelling either. Everyone knows the old writing advice ""Show, don't tell,"" right? One of the most distancing aspects of the VN is how some of the characters are fully explained in exposition with no actions to support it. Elica is the worst example of it. The whole time she's shown to be a ditzy maid looking out for everyone else, and [ ](#s ""suddenly she puts her life and the facility on the line to grant Sion's only wish, because the whole time she hated how Sion was treated."") That's fine, but where did her actions ever convey that? The reader's just supposed to accept it at face value since her backstory says so, but it feels forced with nothing to show for it. On the other hand, Ryou, Lavinia, and Inaba leave impressions solely on their actions. The result? They're the most memorable characters.

The music also wasn't very impressive. It certainly was high quality with some very nice stringed instruments, but it was forgetful and wound up fading out to just being background music. Normally that's not an issue (there's a time and place for background music), but every track was like that, just bland and without any ""oomph"".

So without any support to make the story come to life, eden* just fell flat. I had hoped there would be something more, something that sucked me in and made me really truly care about what was going on, but it never happened. I'm sure other people would like this VN, but not me.","1443658337"

If I had the ROM for the PC-6001 version of Portopia, I might be able to edit the data to allow for it to play.

There's another tape. Ground Zeroes hosts VOL1/the game. VOL2 found in the ""truth"" holds an unlocker, and VOL3 likely does as well. It's most likely only loadable with all 3 parts. All my chips are on it being a romhack of Portopia featuring MGS plot. 

Portopia also features a dialable phone, which I'm 99% certain will have something added for dialing ""204863"".

Also stop telling people at INGSOC about this. I'm FutaSnake. They know already.

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","&gt;The bxt rifle is overpowered. Not as a sniper but as a sidearm. I've only ever seen it used as a more overpowered current-game nova colt for lights. At least give it a fast travel time like the throwing knives.

Agreed.

&gt;Has anyone else equipped the phase rifle just for the energy pack? Just me?

Haven't tried it yet, but now I will. Thrust pack is probably still better for most situations though.

&gt;I find it easier overall to hit blueplates for some reason. Too bad there's no reason to. It doesn't even do full damage.

Yup, WTB fix on that one.

&gt;The light grenade launcher is amazing but completely useless outdoors.

Not its purpose.

&gt;Even the free shrikes server knew to make it costly to have beowulfs out, and you're letting us have them free?!

Good thing most players suck at Beowulf. But yeah, needs a fix.

&gt;If the saber didn't suck so much, this^ wouldn't be a problem.

Yup. With the changes currently in place, make it do 1.5-2x damage and unable to target players.

&gt;The pts patch is to fps what Dark Souls is to rpgs, except the pro players invading your world to fuck you up is the entire game.

Not really seeing the analogy.

&gt;What stealth pack?

Good. Fucking. Riddance.

&gt;A little something died inside me when I did 41 damage with a spinfusor. Why not have a smaller blast radius with the same damage that stops at a certain minimum damage? Basically peeling a few layers off the splash. It's not like I'll miss doing less damage than with a bullet.

Yes. The real loser of linear splash is the MIRV launcher though. Utterly pointless now.

&gt;There is no reason for spinfusors and thumper/bolt launchers to do different damage and have different reload speed. Maybe some people like the arcing projectiles more, or prefer disks.

Agreed.

&gt;The shocklance is a shotgun, and that's all it will ever be used for with the stealth nerfs.

\

&gt;In other news, shotguns now have the innate downside of *not the shocklance.*

Except lance is way more situational.

&gt;Would a light plasma gun be overpowered?

Probably. Plasma Cannon is still insane even if you can't MA with it reliably. Don't want that on Light, they're seeing too much play as is.

&gt;Could spinfusors at least get 20 shots? It's bad enough I've gotten used to 28 but this is ridiculous.


HR should revert that shit back to the old numbers imo. Way too punishing for offense, and playing offense should be heavily incentivized.

&gt;All packs for all classes.

Not sure about Light shield pack or Medium thrust pack. Should be tried though.

&gt;Also the phase rifle is the only way to access the energy pack right now. Come on, ONE passive pack won't kill a game.

Agreed.

&gt;Three words: HEAVY. GRENADE. LAUNCHER.

The sad thing is, it would probably completely replace the Mortar now.","1443658338"
