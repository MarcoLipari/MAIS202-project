"Music","t5_2qh1u","It's true, but he has severely oversimplified the history and causal connection that led to his being born and brought up in America. While the statement he's made, as you've quoted it, does not explicitly say that slavery was justified because it ""brought the blacks to a better place,"" he needs to be taught that there is a very wrong implication there. Not only must we keep in mind the immense suffering they went through, but just how much the economy of the United States was dependent on slave labor. At the end of the day, the United States would not have become the prosperous world power that it is today if the seed money hadn't been the money saved by not paying many of their workers. For that reason, a debt is owed to those slaves.

Secondly, we must keep in mind the immense damage done to Africa *because* of slavery and colonialism. Simply put, in this alternate reality the boy has devised, if it weren't for slavery, yeah, the kid would have grown up in a decrepit African nation. But that nation wouldn't be the hellhole it is now.

EDIT: Oh, and of course, another MAJOR reason why the kid's life is so great is the work done by all the civil rights leaders of the past century. They practically made *lemons* out of fucking *lemonade* -- I mean if there was a way to take a sample of lemonade in a lab and find its pH balance and distill it and clone a seed and grow lemons -- that's metaphorically what our great leaders fucking did. So, for him, America would also ""stink"" if it weren't for the work they did. And he needs to thank God every day for who his people are.

Even if the election comes off without a hitch and Obama wins, nothing will change.  He's from the Democratic party.  The Democratic party has been in power in Congress for awhile, and they have not rescinded a single policy enacted by the Republicans.  Not one.

After 9/11 the only necessaryt hing that needed to be done to guarantee that there was never an attack such as it was to implement bulletproof cockpit doors.  That's it.  EVERYTHING else was a move to fascism and an unreasonable usurpation of power by the government.  Because of the extremely close (stolen) election of Bush, prior to 9/11 he was a lame duck.  He could do nothing since the public obviously did not like him.  After 9/11, it was the Democrats and the Republicans that gave him the go-ahead to build things like the Department of Homeland Security.  It was the Democrats and Republicans that put together and passed the PATRIOT Act.  Obama, nor anyone else in the Demcoratic party, has even CLAIMED that they will rescind Bushes policies.  What in the world leads you to believe that a vote for a third party is futile in an environment when a vote for one candidate and the vote for another make no difference?

I hope that Obama gets elected, I really do.  When his supporters no longer find themselves unable to imagine that he is different while they are being drafted to attack Iran, I will be here to say ""I told you so.""

&gt;Utah County, Utah, is one of the most conservative communities in the nation, judging from voting records in presidential elections. In a mid-1990s court case, Randy Spencer, a court-appointed attorney, defended a Utah County video store whose owner had been charged with 15 counts of obscenity for renting adult tapes. The prosecutors claimed the store was violating the community standards of suburban Provo.
&gt;
&gt;Spencer subpoenaed records that showed the following: Utah County cable subscribers had ordered at least 20,000 explicit movies in the past two years; a local video store was deriving 20 percent of its rental sales from adult movies, even though adult movies only made up 2 percent of the store's inventory; a nearby adult store was racking up on average $111,000 dollars per year selling sex toys and other adult fare; and the Provo Marriott, literally across the street from the courthouse, had sold 3,448 adult pay-per-view movie rentals in 1998 alone.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes, that is a clear limit to science.  It simply does not extend to phenomenon outside the material world.   Science *can* study the physical manifestations as they occur in our bodies, perhaps.  (For example, if you found a group of people who regularly had religious experiences, you could measure their brain waves or heart rates, etc, and science could then create *materialistic theories* about religious experiences in our brains or our DNA, but that's it's limits, its edge, beyond which it really stops being ""science"".  Then it falls outside the purview of science.

Don't get mad at science, though, for having limits.  It's like getting upset at mathematics because it doesn't talk about the rules of basketball or why you like sugar in your coffee while I don't.

Of course, you can use scientific principals to study the supernatural.  A recent scientific double-blind study was performed that showed that  in fact, prayer *doesn't* work. 

By the way, if prayer *did* work, science would then look at materialistic reasons, perhaps study low-level frequencies.  Science would never posit that there was a Supernatural being that made things occur. Just like Math won't tell you that a player can't take more than 2 steps without bouncing the ball in Basketball.","1225498163"

Basically,the tanked media is working with the Obama campaign to shout down dissent and criticism. It is variously racist,or an attack,pick one.

Obama's campaign has openly shut out stations
and reporters that ask hard questions,is now removing news crews from the traveling roadshow,earlier threatened the FCC license of a radio station that dared have a guest they did not like.

They routinely threaten access to anyone that does not play along.

If the press does not report it,it is suppressed, the LAT Khalidi tape,for example.

The issue is the current lack of integrity in the media.

It is a legitimate issue. 

If the roles were reversed,people here would be screaming.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; It is people like you that doesn't allow agree to disagree to work.

Eliezer Yudkowsky has written extensively on the ""agree to disagree"" myth.  You can find his writings on overcomingbias.com.  There you will find a reasoned argument why ""agree to disagree"" is a myth in the plane of discussions about factual matters.

Overcoming Bias is absolutely awesome.  That's my opinion.

&gt; Do you really think that everything is either wrong or right and there is no grey are in the middle?

No.  The fact that ""agree to disagree"" is a myth does not mean that the world is black and white.  Morally, it's all shades of grey.  But a shade of grey is not to be ascertained by personal mores and opinions.  It is to be ascertained by an objective framework of rational morality.

Likewise for scientific research.  Creationism has been throughly debunked by evolution research and factual evidence culled from the real world.  So the two theories aren't equally valid.  Which means that spending resources in the invalid theory is a net loss for progress and humanity.

&gt; Does that mean everyone has to be gay or everyone has to be straight, and we cannot coexist together?  Does that mean everyone has to be a vegetarian, or we cannot coexist together?

Certainly not.  Those are matters of personal choice and aesthetic preference, not matters decidable by morality.

&gt; Just because in your mind, everything that you believe seems right

Please step out of the relativist fantasy.  There IS such a thing as incorrect and correct, there is also such a thing as morally wrong and morally right, and both CAN be ascertained by looking at evidence and reasoning about it.

When I say something is *incorrect* or *wrong*, I say it confident that I can prove it to you through rational thought and real-world evidence.  It is not my opinion, but a matter of fact, which you will be able to reproduce if you do the experiment.

Conversely, when I express my opinion based on a hunch or competing theories one of which is slightly more probable than other, I explicitly tell you ""I am not sure, but I think..."".

In the matter of evolution vs. creation, I do not ""think"" one is correct and one is incorrect.  I am *certain* that evolution is correct and creation is incorrect, beyond a shadow of doubt, through overwhelming evidence.  I am also *certain* that investing resources into creation is *wrong*, because it takes resources away from research into the correct theory which will yield human progress.

I can also be *certain* that I have no right to dictate how other people's resources are to be spent, since those resources aren't mine.  It would be *morally wrong* for me to attempt to wrest those resources out of their hands, just to serve my conclusions.  But it is *morally right* for me to publicly criticize them and shame them into compliance.

&gt; doesn't mean that it is the definite answer.

The definite answer comes from evaluating the evidence using logically valid thought processes.

&gt; I guarantee that those who adamantly disagree with you believe the same things about their ideals and your arguments towards them seem just as crazy as theirs sound to you.

I only sound crazy to you because you have not been sufficiently exposed to the notion that things, beliefs, and opinions can be contrasted with reality well enough to ascertain their validity.

&gt; You are just another stubborn fool who creates the conflict in this world.

I prefer to think of myself as a stubborn sonuvabitch who won't accept the notion that all theories, opinions and morals are equally valid.

After all, if you don't make a decision, all you get is a cesspool of opinion, masses vocally advocating each one of them without any proof of them.  And that breeds stagnation, not progress.

But hey, you're the one demonizing me, and not the other way around.  Judging from historical evidence, it means I must have been doing something right.","1225498695"

"technology","t5_2qh16","I'd propose a double-blind study to you. In a double blind study, neither the experiment administrator nor the subject knows which is the real thing and which is fake. So it's very important that neither you nor the person serving you the wine knows which wine came from which cup.

So, get a bottle of wine. Then, get two glasses - one is the fancy glass and the other is not. Get one person, who stays in another room, to pour the wine straight from the bottle into both glasses and let it sit there for... I dunno, three minutes? Then have that same person pour both glasses into cheap plastic cups. Have him write 1 on one cup and 2 on the other with a marker, as randomly as possible. (I.e., don't always put the same number on the cup with the fancy glass wine. If he can't generate random numbers well enough himself, get him a fair coin to flip each time.)

Get a second person (who was outside the room while the wine was being moved around from cup to cup) to carry the cups out to you in the other room. You taste both cups, and say which one came from the fancy glass and which one came from the normal glass. Record the results. Throw away the plastic cups after each round.

Do this several times. Ideally you'd like it to be hundreds, but I think you'd die of alcohol poisoning long before you finished the hundredth cup. So maybe do it twenty times? (I guess strictly speaking, you don't have to swallow the wine, just taste it...)

At the end of all the trials, give the clipboard with the results to the person who filled the cups and have them check and see how often you go it right. If this fancy cup actually has any effect at all, you'd better be picking the correct cup better than 60% of the time. Remember, just by picking between the cups totally at random, you'd be right 50% of the time. So you have to be right a lot more than that. It's real easy to pick the right one by luck about 55% of the time.


If you do this, come back and post about it. I'm curious to know if there would be any effect at all. It's possible the design of the glass might warm the wine more, or something. Which could cause more of the nice-smelling phenols in the wine to evaporate. Taste is half smell, so a warmer wine could taste better than a cold one. (Still, if you let the wine sit in both the fancy glass and the non-fancy glass for 3 minutes, you'd expect the wine in both glasses would be the same temperature...)","1225498886"

I appreciate that Australia has limited resources and that as a community we must be wary of welcoming in individuals who are going to take more than they can give back however I believe your dept's understanding of Down Syndrome is outdated if you believe that Dr Bernhard Moeller's son Lukas falls into this category.

While many people with Down Syndrome may not go on to have a career and pay taxes, some who are more high functioning, like Lukas, do work and often the jobs they do are hard to fill because of the tedium of the work.  Others who don't work often play a special role in the community that doesn't have a dollar value.  They are helpers and friends and many are volunteers.

But this aside, the good Doctor, his wife and his other child all seem to be capable and willing to give back to this country and given the fact that we in Victoria, like most of the country, are in desperate need of doctors who are willing to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty in the less glamourous areas of the country like the Wimmera.

The lives this man could save and the provision of services in this area, which would reduce complications and the need to send patients to Warnambool, Geelong or Melbourne WILL save far more money from the public purse than what would be spent by a person with Down Syndrome.

The decision to deny the Moeller family perminant visas is down right foolish, no matter how you slice it.  It is foolish from an economic view and it is foolish from a humanitarian view and worse, as this news is picked up by social media websites all over the world it makes Australia look foolish, selfish, heartless and not a destination worth visiting.

So please, Senator, reconsider this decision for the people of the Wimmera who are desperate for a doctor like Dr Moeller, for the Moeller family who came to the lucky country looking for our famous fair go and for the people of Australia who hope to hold our stead in the eyes of the world and their tourist dollars.

Sincerely,

&lt;my real name went here&gt;","1225498955"

This particular quote would align with what you said in your first comment, that demons lie to you. Assuming a spiritual realm to be real, this guilt and shame is also part of what the final scenes of redemption and freedom would deliver the girl from. I went to a church that put on these Hell Houses and I can definitely say that there are aspects of the performances that are easily misunderstood (and inherently flawed) because it is a complicated message and it is easy for people to confuse the message of the taunting demon tour guides with the message of the church. It becomes even further confusing when articles spin the headline to sensationalize it without any semblance of journalistic integrity and despite the often public mission statement of the church that is handed out in line that clearly explains the stance of the church.

How can anyone say good/bad?
By looking at History. Hoover raised the tax on those making over $100,000 in 1932, and the nation sank further in to depression. This never works.

How would 20 percent unemployment not effect all?  Because productivity would still provide food, shelter, entertainment and all the qualities of life for the remaining 80 percent.

How are Obama's policies different?  
Here we have to extrapolate a bit because his record is thin. That isn't a shot, just a factor of his age.  I believe that Obama's policies are much more far reaching in terms of increases in taxation and regulation, coupled with a lack of understanding of free trade and the public debt. These things all conspire to push him further to the left economically.  Keep in mind about  40 to 50 democrats in the house are currently blue dog fiscal conservatives.  Another large block favor free markets and progressive tax rates, coupled with lower cap gains taxes. Obama doesn't appear to support this new ideology sometimes referred to as the third way.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The number one lesson in business: delegate.

Geeks suck tremendously at this, because they (for the most part) think very highly of their own abilities, assume they can do everything well and that when they fail it's because it's ""boring"", not because they're incompetent (at that particular skill, anyway).

Nobody enjoys doing 100% of what goes into running a business.  Guys who excel at sales -- a tremendously important part of any successful business -- don't necessarily love to code, either.  This is why you delegate.  Find someone who could sell your mother a pair of underwear two sizes too small and hire him or her to pitch your product.  If you can't get a guy like that on board, then your product probably sucks, no offense -- sales guys are good at what they do precisely because they know how to convince people to buy things, and if they look at your product and think, ""I'll never be able to make a decent commission on this piece of crap,"" chances are you won't be able to either.

Similar logic applies to accounting and payroll -- you think you can keep your books and who knows, maybe with GnuCash and a bit of reading you can make a reasonable job of it, but once you have a bit of VC money an accountant who actually knows what he's doing will pay for himself, because managing money is hard and he can figure out how to minimize your tax burden, your wasteful spending, etc.

Despite what programmers seem to think, a good half of what goes into running even a software shop has nothing to do with software.  If you don't know that stuff -- and be honest with yourself when you make that assessment -- hire someone to do it.  It's a startup, pay with options, the sales guys get commission on the deals they close, etc.

Whatever you do, don't try to do everything yourself.  Specialization is important, and the time you spend trying incompetently to pitch your product is time that would be better spent in front of the computer improving it.","1225499177"

My election guide says it'll cost $1 billion per year, off set by ticket prices...based on Amtrak's current price of about $100 dollars (round trip) they'll need 10 million people to ride the train per year, just to break even.

How does belief affect perceived reality?

Our justice system assumes free will when it locks people up for crimes... take drug crimes, for example. Heroin and meth... these drugs erase your free will. They alter the way your brain functions. Yet we treat people who are high on these drugs as if they possessed free will when they ""choose"" to continue doing drugs.

We assume that they made the choice to start... yet if all around them they see chaos and misery and deprivation, and they ""chose"" to be high most of the time instead... they haven't really chosen. They also cannot choose to stop on their own.

What of memory as it pertains to the formation of identity? I am, in large part, nothing more than a collection of memories of all the things that have happened to me. Memory is, however, a very faulty thing. People mis-remember events all the time... I've mis-remembered things too. I picked up some medicine from a pharmacy a while back. I called in to get a re-fill, but they said they didn't have me on record for that medication. I'd gone there many times for similar medication... I swore up and down that I'd gone there. I'd always gone there... I honestly remembered going. I honestly remembered picking up that particular medication there... but I hadn't. They didn't carry that certain brand, so I'd had to go to another pharmacy to pick it up. I'd forgotten... yet my mind had filled in all the little details and I remembered going... when I hadn't.

This happens a lot.

If our memories of ourselves are faulty... who are we really? What are we?

If our memories are faulty and our sense of identity weaker for it, and our sense of free will is not quite in line with the reality...

We assume things such as free will, identity, and memory are true and reliable because to do otherwise is to not only invite madness, but social upheaval as well. We hold people to far higher social standards of behavior than biology provides for...

You can't speak in generalities like that and not expect Libertarians or even libertarians to get upset. There's a reason why Obama is going to win, but it's not because libertarians are voting for him, instead I'd argue it has to do with the lack of most brands of libertarian not compromising on McCain.

When you dislike someone enough, it doesn't make sense to say ""oh well they hate McCain more"", no, I just don't like either of them and I'll have plenty of reasons to dispise Obama outside of his compromises on FISA, the Patriot Act, and government bailouts once his four years is up.

Now, after a nearly wholesale rejection of the church I have basically realized that we are all just trying to figure things out and there is a lot that we can't ever know, and we just (hopefully) keep seeking the truth and figuring out how to cope with the realization that we can't know it all. So, while I defend this particular aspect of the hell house scene and think the article is crap for not pointing out (or recognizing) that this particular scene is obviously not representing what the church thinks, but rather, is obviously the church's perspective on how the devil taunts people...i still doubt the overall impact of these hell houses because they seem to turn more people away from the church. many journalists who write their assessment base their perspective on the opinion of protesters and hearsay and rarely even go on the tours themselves to have an actual firsthand account.","1225499980"

&gt; found that the Real GDP Growth Rate (annual average) was 1.9% for Republican administrations and 5.1% for Democratic administrations during this time. Real GDP Growth Rate Per Capita was .7% for the Republicans and 3.8% for the Democrats. However, the professor pointed out that the years comprising the Great Depression and WWII should probably be excluded from the comparison. So economic performance from 1949 (end of Truman administration) to 2005 was compared, which showed Real GDP Growth Rate (annual average) under Republican administrations now stood at 2.9% and Democratic administrations at 4.2%. Real GDP Growth Rate Per Capita was 1.7% for the Republicans and 2.9% for the Democrats. These results prompted Dr. Parker to conclude that “the economy has grown significantly faster under Democratic administrations, and more than twice as fast in per-capita terms.”","1225500173"

Why am I defending the idea to get compensated for something you develop and design?

Because I think its fair for people to get paid for their time and ideas. I'm the type of guy that actually clicks on the ""donate"" button for the open source software I like. Likewise, you deserve compensation as a systems engineer. I think it kinda cool you don't demand more than your fair share. But if you didn't get your fair share, that would suck.

What the fuck am I ever going to develop and design?

I am published writer. Some things I released for free, others, I would hope to get compensation for, I don't want to starve.  As far as software goes, probably jack shit :)

What authority do I have to speak on the subject?  

I have no official authority to speak on this subject. Just sharing my opinion.

What points did I make that I believe deserve respect?

That not having patents can produce stagnation in some fields.  

That people deserve compensation for their time to develop something.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Defining ""fair"" as ""equitable outcomes for one or more parties"" do you, or do you not believe in the concept of ""fairness"" and the pursuit of its concept?

No.  Because (1) there's no way to determine this as we all subjectively value different ends; and (2) an ""equitable"" outcome doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good/decent/not terrible outcome.  Someone could kill both you and I and say ""see, I provided those two an equitable outcome.""  Of course, definitely not a *good* outcome for either of us.  Also, someone else had to determine what's ""equitable"" for us.

&gt;I'm talking about labor as commodity and its inherent iniquity.

I don't think it's inherently unfair that the one who pays all the overhead costs, labor costs, and takes all the risk, etc. derives more benefit than someone who works for him, at-will.

&gt;This holds true only so long as all parties are of equal bargaining power.

There's no such thing.  Someone always has leverage.

&gt;handicapped players are forced to accept terms they would otherwise reject if they held equal bargaining power.

Force implies violence.  Voluntarily accepting a deal that you think should benefit you more, doesn't equate to force.  Or even approach equating to force.

&gt;Maybe you're right. Would you indulge me and explain a little more?

Coercive means the use or threat of physical force.  Necessary means something that must be done (such as eat) or experience ""bad"" consequences.  Necessity can (easily) exist without force.

&gt;In such a case, the idea of ""mutually beneficial exchanges"" becomes a laughable farce.

No, it doesn't.  Because even if you don't like the terms of the deal, you can walk away.  But if you engage in the exchange, you benefit in some way, even if the benefit may be less than you like.

&gt;""[There is] no essential tie between the use of free markets and private ownership of the instruments of production.""

Yes, there is.  You cannot exchange ""public"" property and a free market is nothing more than:

*the free market is an interconnected web or lattice-work; it is made of innumerable parts which intricately mesh together through a network of producers and entrepreneurs exchanging property titles, motivated by a search for profits and avoidance of losses, and calculating by means of a free price system.* ~ Rothbard

&gt;""The advent of socialism may not necessarily alter the underlying dynamics, provided that market competition or its functional equivalent survives.""

This cannot occur while the State owns the means of production.  I see this statement as nothing more than an uniformed and unsupported assertion.

&gt;Libertarianism is a political-economic philosophy and not a purely economic concept.

Actually, it just means ""belief in liberty.""  We can apply it to politics and economics separately or together.

&gt;No discussion about economics is complete without at least a cursory understanding of the political culture in which it exists.

I disagree.  You can understand how a market functions while abstracting away from politics.","1225500508"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; The top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a thermonuclear Orion starship is about 8% to 10% of the speed of light (0.08–0.1c).[4] An atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 3%–5% of the speed of light. A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by matter-antimatter pulse units would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light.
&gt;
&gt; Missions that were designed for an Orion vehicle in the original project included single stage (i.e., directly from Earth's surface) to Mars and back, and a trip to one of the moons of Saturn.[3]
&gt; 
&gt; One possible modern mission for this near-term technology would be to deflect an asteroid that could collide with Earth. The extremely high performance would permit even a late launch to succeed, and the vehicle could effectively transfer a large amount of kinetic energy to the asteroid by simple impact. Also, an automated mission would eliminate the most problematic issues of the design: the shock absorbers.
&gt; 
&gt; Nuclear fission pulse unit powered Orions could provide a fast, economical interplanetary transportation with useful human crewed payloads of several thousand tonnes.
&gt;
&gt; At 0.1c, Orion thermonuclear starships would require a flight time of at least 44 years to reach Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun, not counting time needed to reach that speed. At 0.1c, an Orion starship would require 100 years to travel 10 light years. The late astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that this would be an excellent use for current stockpiles of nuclear weapons.

I agree he was trying to give a compliment to Obama, but can you dispute that in doing so, he insulted Arabs? Those two things are not mutually exclusive, and a simple Google search will show almost unanimous disdain for his comments amongst the Arab American community. 

I'd like to put it back on you, and ask you why is it that of all people, Democrats and Republicans included, that Colin Powell is the only significant political figure to assert that it should not matter if Obama is Muslim or not? 

My thoughts are Republicans would never say it because it undermines the portion of their strategy that wants to play into people's fears that Obama is a scary Muslim foreigner who doesn't see America like you do and is some how a threat to America. 

Democrats would never say it because Republicans would leap on it as evidence that Obama really IS a Muslim, and all the other scary things about him must be true too.

Bottom line, it is yet another piece in McCain's strategy that I believe no one can claim is not partially based on the EXACT SAME thought process that makes Racism so powerful and dangerous. They may not call him an Uppity Nigger, but instead he is an Elite Celebrity-Professor type who thinks he is better than you. They don't call him a foreigner or outsider, instead they suggest he doesn't see America like you do, and he has ties to terrorists, he is a danger to the country, etc.

Fear of the other, fear of outsiders, painting him as a man of Mystery (despite two best-selling books), accusing him of palling around with terrorists, etc. would not work if Obama were a white Christian male.

The ""eternal"" part was the pretext for Cheney and Rumsfield, who along with Oliver North, had developed plans to declare martial law, take over the United States, through some ""catastropic event"" that would provide that pretext (REX-84).

911 was that pretext. the pretext for passing the PATRIOT Act, the Military Commissions Act, Northcom, HR 1455.

The war on terror, the modern war on terror, finds its roots in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, dating from the time Israel, for lack of better term, invaded Palestine and began the process of stealing more and more land until, Palestine was but a memory.

The worldwide muslim reaction since that time is nothing more than blowback, with the radical islamic movement (Arafat was secular) starting when the Mullahs and mosques were the organizing centers for the revolution that brought down the American puppet, the Shah of Iran.

I don't know what nation you live in, but in mine the people with the guns force you to pay taxes or go to prison for 20 years.

Taxation is theft. Not complicity. The taxpayer is the victim here. Just liked the raped. The occurrence does not imply consent.

&gt; But if that's two complicated for you, how about the nice, easy fact that Amish people slaughter their own pigs?

That's provident living in the sense it is more humane than nearly any other way of acquiring meat, as well as self-sufficiency and part of an overall healthy lifestyle.

Public sector employees have no incentive to reduce costs, or improve quality. The only way public services will improve is to introduce competition. 

I'd say this can best be done by removing the public sector from service delivery - public services funded by government, but delivered by non-government actors.

""As for education, if you want to target skills for industry then industry should be specifically taxed to fund this education. After all, companies benefit much more from a large skilled workforce than the worker.""

This is drivel. Tax payers are already funding education from 5-18. The results are not good. The problem is not a lack of money, it's that there's no choice. Bad schools don't close. The public sector is run by public sector employees, with no power, control, choice in the hands of the parent/children. That has to change.","1225501426"

To me the best metaphor for modern corporations is to think of ancient greek gods.  People worship their iconography throughout society.  They are powerful but not omnipotent, work together when it suits them and fight one another when it doesn't.  They become vastly more powerful as more people convert to their faith, but weaken and die out when forgotten. They place value in human lives only insofar as those humans are of utility to them.  

Human beings mostly will do whatever corporations tell them to do, they can't fight against the gods unless they have other gods or some powerful titanic force to aid them.","1225501603"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","While I applaud the general sentiment you seem to be espousing, I take issue with your assertion that you can label the principles in your first paragraph like equality before the law, etc. as 'American'.  I may be misinterpreting your intent, but these principles are not the sole domain of the USA - these are general, universal principles of justice and human rights.

The usage of the terms 'American' or 'un-American' (or in my own country's case 'Australian' or 'un-Australian') to refer to particular attitudes or behaviours related to universal principles like justice and human rights is arrogant regardless of whether they're used in the McCarthyist sense or in the sense that you argue for.  No nationality has sole claim to these principles: behaviour that violates them is unjust, not un-American.

I'd also call you up on your analysis of why McCarthyism was wrong.  It wasn't just because he and his cronies used the deceitful techniques you described - even if he hadn't lied and had genuinely, honestly and lawfully found 'reds under the bed!!', he would still be wrong.  It is a universal human right that people be allowed to adhere to any political creed or ideology that they wish.

Pointless. I pretty much hate PHP now, but I did start with PHP. I never went to school for what I did. When I was about 16, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, and with web programming, all that limits you is pretty much your own knowledge. This was very, very attractive to me, and I immediately decided to do it. PHP being the powerhouse and one of the most known ones (seriously, go to a book store), I started with it. 

And I don't really regret it, learning the inane-ness of that language has helped me come to grips with pretty much every other language after it.

Although I'm an independent, I perceive the Democratic party as always being more accepting of people even if they don't adopt all of the party's ideas.  Republicans, on the other hand, have adopted policies of Christians-only... with anti-communist membership card required too!

In fact, the red-baiting is nothing new.  If you're too young to already know about it... just look in to Nixon's early days or read up on Joe McCarthy.

Life sucks. That's what bitter hatred is for, not whiny demands.

&gt; That not having patents can produce stagnation in some fields.

I disagree with that too. Especially since pharma is nothing but a cesspit of stagnation. Which leaves the chemicals industry as a sole remaining unknown. At this point your statement ""... in some field**s**"" is literally wrong.

&gt; That people deserve compensation for their time to develop something.

People do their best work when they do it for its own sake. And as an intellectual, I believe that ideas have independent value, so I don't need any additional value to play with them. I also know something else, that there is NO AMOUNT of money that could EVER compensate me for wasting my time managing other people. The only thing that would ever do so is the power to execute people.

Killing idiots doing great evil in the world would be compensation for my talents going to waste managing people. I wouldn't have to waste my time thinking about the evil they're performing. I haven't tried to price the cost of killing the political elite (DNC+RNC+Fortune100) and get away with it, but I believe it to be north of a billion dollars. And I don't believe anyone will ever hand me a billion dollars in tax-free cash for managing a small company.

&gt; I am published writer. Some things I released for free, others, I would hope to get compensation for, I don't want to starve.

All the best epic authors are female. Learn from them. :)

You should read some of Michael Goldhaber's Attention Economy essays. Monetary compensation is not your just reward. It's a chimera resulting from living in a transitional economy.

I'm actually not sure how much creativity is required to be a good author. I know the best novelists have no analytics - capacity for logic. I think the profile is no analytics, high intelligence, middling creativity.","1225502553"

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt;those hard-working executives who created this mess.

They're not the ones who created this mess, that's my point. The investment banks are not the ones responsible for examining the securities; Rating agencies do this, and issue ratings based on factors such as the probability of defaults. 

If rating agencies issue a high rating to a security, that security is worth more on the market. These ratings are (were) trusted because we assume that the agencies are objective and do their jobs. Of course, without proper regulation such as what was imposed on public auditing, this did not happen.

When these agencies rated securities higher than their real value on the market, they became enablers for loan originators to package subprime loans into more profitable securities. The market was created, and this encouraged lenders to unscrupulously lend (such as with teaser rates) to meet the market's demands. Investment banks wouldn't know any better, since they trust the supposedly correct ratings (and subsequent prices) on these securities - and their mistake is not looking outside of that paradigm and questioning whether or not these ratings were correct.

So despite the partners at investment banks perhaps not catching the problem, the people that ""created"" the problem were not them, but rather Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's, etc.","1225502912"

Being March in Maryland, there was no snow.  I ended up driving north about 10 hrs to Lake Placid before I found a mountain with snow.  I had arrived at night so I slept in my car (80's Camero) and woke up to a fresh blanket of snow on the glass T-top roof. It was awesome.  I got up and went skiing for the day.  It was my first time skiing alone and I really enjoyed it.  Did the trails I wanted, at the speed I wanted and just had a great time.  Drove home that night.  Being a Camero I did get stuck in the snow in a parking lot once.

Second thing was I was a couple of years older, about 22, dropped out of college, and not in a good place in life, but still in Maryland.  At about 3 am on night, I started driving.  I drove for a couple of days and ended up in Portland, OR.  I spent a couple of nights in a hostel in Missoula, MT.  I spent about a week in hostels in Portland and Tacoma.  I drove down to Eureka, CA and watched sunset on the Pacific.  I ran out of money on the drive home.  Found an online friend in Columbus at Ohio and borrowed $20 bucks for gas.  Had a Tercel and that was enough for me to get home in the mid 90's.  He was in the CS grad dept of Ohio and I never paid him back as I lost touch of my friends from that time.

There are basically 2 options for CPU if you have $150-ish to spend on it. A 45nm processor or a 65nm processor. The latter would be cheaper, but run hotter/are less overclockable. Also, you need to make a choice between a slower quad-core or a faster dual-core. As we all know, very few apps scale well over more cores, but you might know more about the apps you intend to run (and how many of them), and your usage models.

The Q6600 is an absolute bargain at this time, and the ones currently in market are the G0 stepping -- they overclock very well with a decent motherboard.

I don't know where you live but there are plenty of non public sector administered education alternatives in Australia and the United Kingdom. A call for more of the same won't fix a thing.

Here's another problem in your argument. There exists bad schools. Bad schools are run by public sector. Therefore the public sector are the reason for the bad schools. Here's an alternative: bad schools tend to be in low socio economic areas, behavioural problems are much more prominent in low socio economic areas, behavioural problems in class are a leading cause in reduction of quality of education. Teachers transfer out of bad schools, continuity of teacher employment/care is a positive for quality of education.

Yes what she said--on the fly mind you--may have been incorrect in a technical sense: The problem isn't that freedom of expression is being curtailed by the government.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; I think everyone has some duty to protect the truth, even against self-serving lies.

Even if this were true, I don't see how this relates to Graham's case. Graham has not told self-serving lies. What has happened is that his fans have perhaps treated him as greater than he is, and he has chosen not to say ""Guys, you act like I'm a 9/10, when really I'm only an 8/10."" In any case, I'm not going to pursue this point further. 

&gt; given the ratio of success to failure among dot-coms of that vintage, I would guess that luck played a significant role. 

I don't see how the first has anything to do with the second. Think about it: you're saying ""Most startups fail. Therefore, if a startup succeeds, it was primarily due to luck."" You can replace ""primarily"" with any modifier you like; it still doesn't follow.

I submit that you'd need a lot more specific information about a whole lot of stuff to be able to demonstrate convincingly that Graham (or anyone) succeeded primarily (modulo preferred modifier) due to luck. As far as I can tell, you don't have that information. Yet you seem *determined* to claim that it was primarily luck. Why is this? Do you just not believe that anyone succeeds due to skill or insight?

&gt; And do you really admire someone who saw a pack of idiots and jumped in to fleece them?

No, but is that what Graham did? I don't see that. He made something and sold it to Yahoo. Keep in mind when/if pursuing this point: Mergers and Acquisitions *always* involve overpaying w/r/t the market value (although not necessarily to the value-to-the-buyer).

&gt; Look at social mobility between income quintiles.

Why? Even if such figures were worth looking at, they wouldn't prove your point. Essentially, you're saying that most people who *are* rich are *born* rich. Therefore, if somebody *gets* rich, it was due to luck. Wrong. It shows that if somebody *is* rich, it is probably due to luck, because that person was probably one of the rich people who was born rich, rather than one who got rich. But the number or rate of people who get rich tells me nothing about whether such people were mainly lucky or mainly skillful. 

In any case, ""mobility between income quintiles"" is a horrible statistic. It doesn't tell you what you think it's telling you. For example:

1. Income is not wealth. Somebody who is born into poverty, gets rich, and then retires has ""ended up where he started"" income-wise, but you wouldn't count him as evidence against social mobility. 

2. Whether people end up where they start doesn't tell us what they do in between. I understand that most people's incomes rise as they get older, peak at some point, and then go down. But of course, even as their incomes decline, their wealth goes up.

In general, there are all sorts of statistics of this sort which are pure nonsense. If they tell you what you want to hear, you don't question them. Next time you read such a statistic, ask yourself whether it is possible that the statistic is literally true, but what the statistic is supposed to imply is false. Ask yourself whether it is legitimate to identify that which is literally measured by the statistic and the feature of society (or whatever) it is supposed to be an indicator of. Nobody who has an axe to grind is going to do this for you.","1225504363"

This way, in order for a bill to pass the executive branch and become law, it would have to be approved by at least three of the five points.  If 3 points are against a bill, it becomes the goal of the other two to sway one in favor of it.  The same would go for other executive responsibilities, like judicial branch approval.

In addition to saying he didn't think it could be done, Rider also anticipated that just maybe you could extract entropy from the plasma this way. See page 124 - ""Wave Particle Interactions"".

Still, setting up enough lasers to keep the entropy at bay might end up costing more energy than it's worth. So this is no *guarantee* that PolyWell will work.

But I think it is sufficient wiggle room to throw a couple million dollars at it. That's a pretty small investment if this actually does end up being cheap, clean fusion.

Meanwhile, with an Athlon windows will snap open almost instantly and applications will always be ready for input. No waiting for a menu to pop open.

I'm not saying that it's not coming from both sides, but it's certainly coming from Israel.

And lest some straw man think that I'm an anti-Semite, here's a quote (more or less) from my Israeli mother: ""And if [Obama's] tough on Israel, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe we need someone to not be so easy on Israel, to make them uncomfortable to move the peace plan forward.""

The 'mm' specification given is the focal length.  The wikipedia article on [focal length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length) has all of the details but here are the interesting points.  A lens is either fixed (one focal length) or zoom (has a range of focal lengths).  For 35mm film, a 50mm (or so) lens is called ""normal"".  Larger numbers (i.e. 200mm) are called telephoto, these have a narrow field of view and have a magnifying effect, they're used for distant subjects.  Smaller numbers (i.e. 14mm) are called wide-angle, they have a wide field of view -- they can .

Every lens has tradeoffs -- size, weight, cost, aperture, zoom-range, distortion, color handling.  The relationships are complex but because of all these tradeoffs, there's no such thing as a perfect lens.

Prime lenses are fixed-focal-length.  They trade away zoom-capability in exchange for wider apertures, low distortion, superior color handling, and higher definition.

The 50mm lenses I mentioned earlier (Nikon and Canon offer similar lenses, though the Canon has an in-lens focus motor) offer light weight, low cost (~$100), and wide apertures (f/1.8).  The wide aperture lets in lots of light which lets you shoot in dimmer environments without flash.  A lens with a narrower aperture would require longer exposures, and longer exposures have a higher chance of blur (subject motion and/or camera shake).","1225504966"

The whole slavery caused the current crisis in the black community argument doesn't mesh well with reality.  There was a theory in the 60s that broken families in the black community were caused by slavery, but research on that very topic in the 60s contradicted that notion and found that after reconstruction that most black children had both parents.

In that time we spent alot of time trying to build the reputation of many great organisations. (Plan Australia included) Alot of charities will not take donations from organisations as they do not wish to be associated with any other name apart from their own. I know this sounds strange but for many it is a blanket rule to prevent cooperations using the charities name as a marketing tool. It is a hard call to make on a charities behalf but there have been many times when companies of less the positive standing in the community will make a large donation to try and bulster the name. This is not a slag at D+D its just not taking money that was made from the selling of a product.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You could be right, or it could be that Obama was being pragmatic. Consider this, if Obama voted against funding the funding would have still passed, only now he has to face constant charges of not ""supporting the troops."" The fact is, the best way he could support the troops is to get elected President and then start to bring them home. Throwing the election to McCain certainly wouldn't do the troops any good. And I have a hunch that if the Dems were able to defund the war, Bush and Cheney would have found a way to get a lot of troops killed and then tried to cynically blame it on the Dems... would you really put that past them?

I used to be an idealist and held politicians to an impossibly high standard. I still admire guys like Kucinich who try to meet those lofty standards, but it isn't lost on me that they rarely manage to accomplish much. I think, or at least hope, that Obama understands that and is trying to play within the system so he can actually get some things done, even if that means making strategic compromises. But before we'll know the answer he has to actually get elected, I'm willing to cut him some slack until then, especially since my only other option at this time is McCain, and I have no illusions about where he stands.","1225506105"

""On February 1, 2008, CMPA issued a news release lauding the election coverage of Fox News. A CMPA concluded ""FOX stands out for having the heaviest and most issue-oriented election coverage. ... FOX was also twice as substantive as the broadcast networks. Almost one-third of all stories on FOX (30%) dealt with policy issues, nearly double the proportion (16%) on the networks. FOX also carried less coverage of the horse race and candidate tactics than any of broadcast networks.""[9]""

""Thus, out of the total of $2,960,916 in foundation grants, nearly all of it ($2,668,916) came from just four sources: the John M. Olin, Scaife, and Smith Richardson foundations.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;But even more have shown (through their votes) that they want those political stories on the main reddit.

From the rest of your post I get the sense that you're saying that to justify having politics stories on the main reddit, because you like them there, rather than being interested in whether the upvotes actually mean other people want them there.  It's possible that other people *do*, but the upvotes do not make it nearly as clear-cut as you're suggesting.  Upvotes are a vote on the headline more than anything else.  The votes clearly demonstrate that people like the articles (or at least the headlines), but what they say about subreddit preference is a lot more murky. 

We've seen headlines voted very high on the front page which are entirely contradicted by the first paragraph in the article itself and by most of the posts in the thread (e.g. ""Every single 2008 Nobel Laureate endorses Obama"", ""Canada bans all fees on text messages""), which demonstrates (if proof was needed) that people vote up headlines without reading the article or comments.  If they're being that quick to upvote, I would say it's unlikely that they're consistently checking to make sure it's the right subreddit (especially since if they're upvoting a politics article, they're probably not one of the people who unsubscribed from politics and is paying close attention to misplaced politics articles). 

I'm subscribed to both politics and the main reddit, and so I expect to see political stories on my front page, and tend to assume they're in the politics subreddit without explicitly checking.  If I realize that a political article is in the main reddit, I downvote it (even if I had previously upvoted it), but that's usually only because someone says ""politics subreddit please"" in a post that's somewhere in the middle of the page, and I don't always scroll down that far or notice those posts when I skim.  

My point is that while it's certainly possible that people do want those stories on the main reddit, it's hard to base it on the simple fact that they get voted up, because of the way people vote without paying attention to what they're voting on (other than the headline).  I don't think I'm the only one who sometimes votes them up by mistake without realizing they're in the wrong place, and apparently a shitload of people vote things based on the headline without even glancing at the article or comments, let alone the subreddit.

&gt;And just as easy to hide submissions you don't want to see. 

It's easy compared to real-life manual labor, but by software standards (where boring, repetitive, frequent and easily-automated tasks are expected to be handled by the software, not over and over by the user), it's a big pain.  It gets REALLY tiresome when you have to keep doing it with a bunch of new articles every time you visit reddit. 
Again, I'm not speaking as someone who blocks politics articles myself, but I sympathize with people who need to (I was doing the ""hide a dozen articles every time I check reddit"" thing with a few users who flooded some subreddits with really lame links, before I found the greasemonkey filter script to do it for me).","1225506439"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","This move is entirely selfish.  Right now, so many people are foreclosing that the market is getting absolutely FLOODED with foreclosure properties, and it's driving the prices down everywhere.  

My mother is attempting to (legitimately) sell her house in Florida.  It's a growing area.  The housing bust had not hit it, at least not a month ago.  She was living in an area of $200,000 homes but she priced hers at $149, the lowest price for three square miles, *specifically* to undercut the competition for a quick sell.

Three weeks later, the bank foreclosed on a house three doors down from her, comparable to her own, and are now selling it at $105,000.  And not getting any takers.

Both mom and her real estate agent have no idea what to do.  As long as that house is sitting there, they're boned.  But they simply can't compete.  Mom priced her house to sell but still allow her to get back the 10 years of equity she put on it.  The bank priced theirs to sell to the first person to even have a slight interest, the actual value of the house be damned.

And it's not selling.

And in the meantime, they have to keep up these foreclosed houses.  That's money going out of their pockets that they aren't getting back.  And if they're *already* selling the houses at fire sale prices, what are they going to do as MORE get foreclosed on?

Drop the price further?

No, right now it's looking like the housing market is so terrible that forcing to-be-foreclosed families to pay for their own upkeep is ""punishment"" enough.  That's capital the bank doesn't have to waste throwing good money after bad.  And the moment the market turns around, and banks think they can unload their foreclosed properties, they'll be foreclosing again.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Well I don't think you'll convince policy makers to do much of anything - they're reactionary at best, and at worst they work to constrain reality to their plans (rather than embracing reality).

For authenticated photos (I skimmed the paper), there really aren't huge benefits to be gained. The media doesn't really have a demand - they aren't really looking to do hard investigation, and if a photo is without verification, they're not going to hold back printing it. I can see it being used for evidence gathering in local cases, but for anything wider scoped, a well funded adversary can easily forge photos.

The problems are similar in any system trying to graft cryptography onto an existing system. SSL CAs associate keys to DNS names, leading to a myriad of aliasing ambiguities, only one trust level, and trivial attacks from well funded adversaries. Likewise, DRM tries to preserve the current system of content cartels tracking by tying computing rights to ""real world identity"".

The bright future I see involves the creation of _new_ systems, with cryptographic _foundations_, that allow individuals and groups to privately associate. If we're to have any freedom, this is the only way forward.

Ovulation is timed so the fertilised egg will have the best conditions to implant in the lining of the uterus.  The body doesn't keep this lining at its peak all the time (maybe too much expenditure of energy? Nature is very careful not to overspend). If no fertilisation occurs, the lining is reabsorbed, and some is released through mentruation.  I suppose there are many possible reproductive models, but this is the one we have evolved.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Pelosi doesn't see Sheehan as a threat, but as a welcome outlet for extreme-left liberals.

In response to Cindy's direct question (which only came after the host ended Cindy's confused tirade) Pelosi laid out a very cogent argument against impeachment: why delay health care for children, raising the minimum wage, and any/all other legislation to pursue a dubious impeachment claim that would polarize this country even more? Not to mention the narrative of as soon as the Dems gain a Congressional majority, they go impeach instead of legislate. Pelosi (and I) understand that many Americans want their pound of flesh from Bush and the conservative movement; frankly there are many, many more important things to take care of first. I think true progressives would know which path is preferable, while partisans like yourself have made your preference quite clear.

And in the end Pelosi's judgment is being borne out; the taint of a possibly-impeachable President has leached into his Party, and instead of cashing in with an impeachment proceeding, we have a sea change towards a progressive politics.

As a well-read liberal myself I'd like to see Bush impeached and duly punished; but it wouldn't have been for free, and it may not have been redemptive.

And as for Sheehan, she's a symbol, a post-Iraq liberal Joe the Plumber. That's fine, and she should totally pursue a career in Texas, but realistically there's no way she should actually replace San Francisco's senior representative with her senior committee memberships.

Anyway, Sheehan's polling in the single digit percentages -- here's hoping that that convinces Pelosi to lean a bit more left, at least.","1225507165"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I could see it being a multi tiered system of command. At the bottom it would break into squad leaders taking command elements from tactical shooters. Then higher rank players could become officers and have the ability to lead larger groups and have access to a basic command map. 

Then above that there could be higher rank officers who have the option to play a full on RTS from designated command centers and they can send direct orders and manage their troops, providing the grunt level players with useful logistical support and info from a different perspective. A better commander could lead their troops to a victory over a group who didn't have anyone watching over them from above or were lead by an incompetent/inattentive officer. 

Above that would be a risk type game that would only be available to a few top players where you would issue major orders to your support commanders who would be doing the micromanaging. 

Basically players would be making all of the ""quests"" between small skirmishes over relatively unimportant things to massive battles over cities or against bases and macro strategy managing the fronts and advances and policies. Any high rank player can go to the front lines if they want though so you won't get stuck with an RTS if you're more of a FPS fan.

""On February 1, 2008, CMPA issued a news release lauding the election coverage of Fox News. A CMPA concluded ""FOX stands out for having the heaviest and most issue-oriented election coverage. ... FOX was also twice as substantive as the broadcast networks. Almost one-third of all stories on FOX (30%) dealt with policy issues, nearly double the proportion (16%) on the networks. FOX also carried less coverage of the horse race and candidate tactics than any of broadcast networks.""[9]""

""According to Salon.com, ""the seed money for [the] center was solicited by the likes of Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson"".[3]

""Thus, out of the total of $2,960,916 in foundation grants, nearly all of it ($2,668,916) came from just four sources: the John M. Olin, Scaife, and Smith Richardson foundations. In other words, CMPA received 86% of its foundation funding from those four donors. Here is a sample of other right-wing causes funded by these 3 donors, as listed by their respective SourceWatch articles...""

"politics","t5_2cneq","My dad and I have been re-painting my grandmothers house and putting in some flooring. Before fox news she used to be a democrat, now every night my Dad tries to tell her that even if he *was* a Muslim it would be perfectly fine with him. Or even if Bill Clinton had sex with a hundred people he wouldn't care because that does not get in the way of him being president.

I could give some prime examples of fox brain washing if anyone is interested. For instance any time a republican does something bad and my Dad has proof, it was actually just a liberal posing as a republican. Clever little devils.

My grandma when trying to convince me or my dad that Obama is a terrorist/communist/socialist always ask things like: Where did he get all his money? Where was he born, we *just don't know*! It is really sad to see that she is actually living in real honest fear that fox news has put her in.

Just a side note, my dad is pretty neutral he isn't the captain of the Obama ship in the high Obama seas to Obamadonia (he likes Ron Paul), but he hates it when political discussion is about the person and not their polices.

Continuing on... The absolute worst part is that she trumpets fox news as the most unbiased news source there is, and she is very proud that she gets so many different view points. She always says that infamous fox line ""We put all view points on even if we don't like it."" She always says that she thinks Bush will go down as the greatest president in history, he will be up there with Lincon, and Washington. 

Her supporting information for this statement is that Bush apparently ran the whole country by himself, without the help of the senate or the congress. He took us through a war and stopped the Arabs from marching in and taking over. She used to be a democrat.

I could go on, but you get the point.

If it is a platinum-group-element source, it is almost definitely a layered mafic intrusion (like, say, East Bull Lake near Elliot Lake, Ontario). In that case the PGE enrichment is a result of the primary crystal layering in the intrusion, NOT a secondary enrichment process.

Essentially, as a gabbro (same composition as basalt but intrusive...) cools, some crystals will form that are dense... they sink. Since crystal formation is a function of temperature, crystals form in sequence, and so you get profound compositional layering. 

They are beautiful rocks but rare. Hence PGE's are expensive...

So, indirectly, it is a result of 'time' but not in the sense of, say, the secondary processes that enrich the cap on a copper deposit (e.g. Morenci in NE Arizona) or that mobilize uranium in a roll-front deposit.

from Washington Post today       
   
Networks have long taken flak for calling elections early, but what are newspaper editors to do when a cartoonist ""calls"" an election several days in advance? That's the controversial question raised by next Wednesday's ""Doonesbury,"" which Pulitzer-winning creator Garry Trudeau has already submitted and which has been sent to editors. 

In the strip, Trudeau declares that Barack Obama has won the presidential election. (His syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate, says a replacement strip will be made available to newspapers who request it.)


Garry Trudeau calls the election for Obama in next Wednesday's ""Doonesbury."" (Universal Press Syndicate)Enlarge Comic
 


So what prompted the cartoonist to ""call"" the outcome of the election? Trudeau tells Comic Riffs today: ""If I didn't call the election, I'd have no premise for the week and be forced to write about something else. I didn't want to write about something else. This is history.""

Did Trudeau then create the strip with complete and utter confidence that Obama will win? ""Nope, more like rational risk assessment,"" Trudeau explains. ""Nate Silver at Fivethirtyeight.com is now giving McCain a 3.7% chance of winning -- pretty comfortable odds. ... Here's the way I look at it: If Obama wins, I'm in the flow and commenting on a phenomenon. If he loses, it'll be a massive upset, and the goofy misprediction of a comic strip will be pretty much lost in the uproar.  I figure I can survive a little egg on my face.""

But will the yolk also be on editors who run the strip? Says Trudeau: ""We've supplied our clients with a week of reruns, just in case.""

Trudeau adds: ""My editor mentioned initial 'panic and anger' from some papers, but she said cooler heads are prevailing today.""

Kathie Kerr, the syndicate's vice president for communications, tells Comic Riffs: ""So far, there have been about a dozen calls and/or e-mails [from editors], but they are still coming in. ... They are all requesting the substitute strips; some of them haven't made a decision about running them, but they do want access to them."" 

Kerr adds: ""Still, that's not a huge percentage considering the size of Garry 's client list,"" which is roughly 1,400 newspapers. 

NOTE: The Washington Post and WashingtonPost.com plan to publish Trudeau's ""prediction"" strip.

You will be surprised (or disbelieve) that I am pragmatic enough to encompass all viewpoints, even if there are many that don't go much beyond being labeled psychotic or immoral or ignorant.

It's possible to be pragmatic and principled. It's possible to sell your work and to admit that this is a mere necessity of life in a corrupt regime. The real difference is that the principled person will look for an alternative. They may not find one but they'll look.

Noam Chomsky for example is an unprincipled scumbag. He claims to be an anarcho-syndicalist but he's exploited the copyrights for his books by putting them into a multi-million dollar trust fund. He's already wealthy and HE has got plenty of options, and he's not taking those options.

As another example, the GPL software license was created by another unprincipled scumbag. Stallman uses communist propaganda to defend a right-wing liberal license. The other option is proprietary software. Since both those options are exploitative (both exploit programmers in practice), as a principled person I will CREATE a third option.

That's what I mean. If the options on offer are all exploitative and you care about principle then try to create your own.","1225508634"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;I may be misinterpreting your intent, but these principles are not the sole domain of the USA - these are general, universal principles of justice and human rights.

Each of the principles themselves are obviously not limited to America, many of them came from European philosophers, and even in that case you could easily make the case that they merely observed these things rather than having created them.  However, the very specific combination of these natural-law principles is what I am referring to.  For instance, nowhere is privacy explicitly named in the Bill of Rights.  That peculiar omission would be enumerated in the class of ""American"" whereas it would be absent (the omission that is...) from almost any other set of principles drawn from natural law.

For example, countries like England and Austrlia share many of the same natural law concepts but, at the same time, violate very significant territories of natural law by instituting governmental censorship of 'seditious' or 'hateful' or other classes of media.  Those particular combinations would get labeled ""English"" and ""Australian"" in turn.

Yes, while America and Austrlia both list ""justice"" as one of their principles, they differ in that, for a simple example among many, America lists explicitly that retaining a public which is armed and able to destroy its government is a principle on which they base their nation.  Australia does not include this.  Opposing freedom of gun ownership would then clearly be un-American.  It would not be un-Australian, however.  If you opposed justice and democracy themselves, you would be both un-American and un-Australian, but not un-Saudi-Arabian as they believe that democracy is an evil perpetrated by mankind at the expense of the divine law of god.

I don't mean to indicate any level of 'exclusivity' by labelling this specific combination of principles ""American"", but there is no other word I know of that refers to them.

&gt;It is a universal human right that people be allowed to adhere to any political creed or ideology that they wish. Communism, socialism or any other 'ism' should not be criminal: the only things that should be prosecuted by the state are actions, not ideas.

Certainly.  Such a concept is well in keeping with the American set of principles I've named (not, however, Australias as they embrace government-moderated censorship of 'seditious' material).  McCarthys accusations, I believe (I am not especially educated on his witch hunt), were that these people not only believed in Communism, but were actively acting to bring about an end to the specific American ideals of private property and capitalism.  If he had discovered Senators, for example, who were planning to push through legislation designed to assert government control of all mechanisms of production, he would have been right to call those people out as Anti-American.  I say Anti- because it is not merely a situation of being indifferent or in some way not wholly dedicated to the ideals, but actively opposed to them.","1225508670"

""Palin, who earns $125,000 a year, claimed and received $16,951 as her allowance, which officials say was permitted because her official ""duty station"" is Juneau, according to an analysis of her travel documents by The Washington Post.""


""Gubernatorial spokeswoman Sharon Leighow said Monday that Palin's expenses are not unusual and that, under state policy, the first family could have claimed per diem expenses for each child taken on official business but has not done so.""



""The state finance director, Kim Garnero, said Alaska law exempts the governor's office from elaborate travel regulations. Said Leighow: ""The governor is entitled to a per diem, and she claims it.""


""Palin rarely sought reimbursement for meals while staying in Anchorage or Wasilla, the reports show.""

""Gov. Palin has spent far less on her personal travel than her predecessor: $93,000 on airfare in 2007, compared with $463,000 spent the year before by her predecessor, Frank Murkowski. He traveled often in an executive jet that Palin called an extravagance during her campaign. She sold it after she was sworn into office.""

Then Jesus said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who had a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was squandering his property. So he summoned him and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give me an accounting of your management, because you cannot be my manager any longer.’ Then the manager said to himself, ‘What will I do, now that my master is taking the position away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg. I have decided what to do so that, when I am dismissed as manager, people may welcome me into their homes.’ So, summoning his master’s debtors one by one, he asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ He answered, ‘A hundred jugs of olive oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it fifty.’ Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He replied, ‘A hundred containers of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill and make it eighty.’ And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.

what is due to God and what is due to one's husband. It is not that Islam suppresses

"business","t5_2qgzg","To be totally fair, this more represents the fundamental shift in the way the banks operate rather than any underlying problem. Instead of keeping a 'reserve' of gold (or whatever currency is popular) of 10% the money they lend out, then now have a list of people whom have promised to work for X years in order to pay off a given debt (normally a mortgage). As such, gold or currency is no longer the underlying asset of our society, but more the promise of consumers to work for X years to pay their debts off, a form of indentured slavery, if they don't realize the true compounding power of the debts they create. If they don't, they'll be working minimum wage jobs to try and pay rent, not a good situation to be in.

Basically, if you have a debt with a bank, it is  YOUR promise to pay that debt that is the underlying asset they lend more money out over, not gold/currencies in reserve. Gold in a vault does nothing. Gold sold and the money lent to a entrepreneur may return many, many times the original deposit, via fractional reserve lending (10,000 original deposit lent out may make up to 100000 if money lent is redeposited in the same bank)etc., all of which is good for the economy as it means more money for you and I to make, provided everyone is paying their debts that is... 

In essence, why use a symbol of your power over other people when you have a printed, signed contract stating others' indebtedness to you and the fact that if they fail in their obligations to you, you take their house/car/insurance etc etc.

If there is a deflationary crash, the debts increase in value relative to goods and services (i.e. banks win). For example, if you owe a bank $100,000 today, which equals 1 house  (let's say) and there is deflation, ignoring repossessions for now, it is easy to see that that money paid back, plus interest of course, in ten years will buy more ""house"" than the same money today, depending on how far deflation occurred. If 50% drop in prices, then two and a bit houses can be bought in 10 years etc etc 

If there is an inflationary period then the value of the debts decreases relative to the different markets, i.e. property or shares etc. In this case the banks can enforce their rights against the property owners and take back the properties, again winning (but having to write off the interest that would have been made from the original loan). Also, the original money that was lent for the purchase of the property has already seeped into the wider economy. This means money is out there which hasn't yet been earnt, basically causing an inflationary pressure to develop (the currency pool has increased, but the economy has not received the same amount of productive labour). This of course would fuel more house repossessions as the banks would try and swap their debts for houses in an inflationary market. Again the banks would be in a strong position in ten years time. 

Personally, I'm using this (repossession levels) as a barometer for what the banks really think is going on. When they thought inflation was coming (due to high oil prices etc) they were keenly snapping up defaulters' houses, now the prices of oil have fallen, with shares generally  and, most importantly, property, suddenly the banks are 'kindly' allowing people to stay in their houses. In fact, they are hoping that when the time comes for repossession, prices will have fallen whilst it was YOUR property, not the banks, thus you take the hit for the deflation, not their books (at the same time getting to act magnanimously about how they are helping in this hard time, LOL). It's similar to the courts who kindly allow your appeal to stay in your home knowing full well you will lose, swapping your hope for that 1 in 100 case where suddenly you get to keep your house, whilst all the time taking cold hard cash out against you. Ye old trick of exploiting desperate emotion with reason.... again, official line ""helping homeowners cope"", end result, you lose due to deflation and, in this case, spiraling court costs to be reclaimed against you.

As you can see, not a perfect situation, as it is possible to misjudge and snap up too many houses just as deflation kick in, but still, the banks would appear to have a better fighting chance of running through all this unscathed than the average homeowner. Also, I haven't mentioned, at all, the massive bribes the governments are paying the bank to try and get them to stop playing shenanigans with world currencies and peoples homes. Kinda the perfect icing on a rather distasteful cake. 

Thus you can see, it is the manipulation of debt which forms the heart of banking today, not gold or any other currency. Banking runs on the promises of consumers to pay their debts. That is what I believe this graph represents. 

(For a far more lucid explanation, if anyone hasn't already, you can watch [Money as Debt](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9050474362583451279).

Municipal and state bond insurers, for example, now have their hands out, They are asking for up to $1.4 trillion in state and municipal bonds to be guaranteed, along with, perhaps, an additional $900 million in corporate and other debt they insure. As one lobbyist said to The Washington Post, “Everyone has their hand out now. Economists call it moral hazard. If you subsidize bad or risky behavior, you end up creating a perverse incentive for the same bad and risky behavior in the future. An entire new entitlement will now be in place: the “right” to be protected from ever bearing the cost of errors, mistakes, and rash and irresponsible decisions. Matching this will be a special entitlement industry of lawyers and lobbyists paid by all the various groups and industries covered by the guarantees to see that everyone gets what is “rightfully” theirs; and to make the case for expanding the benefits at the political bailout trough. This is a policy that not only ends up extending government power over the populous, but weakens the character qualities in people without which a healthy and freedom society cannot long survive.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;it's that populous can easily over-write the truth

I think that's one of the most important points of our time and will affect humanity for generations to come.  However, consider the historical case.  Throughout history it has been the very few - typically the church - that have had the power to over-write the truth.  To declare what is true, change history, etc.  Now, it is in the hands of the many, in the hands of people who must convince one another in order to have them pass along an idea.  We may see the last throes of religion and, finally, society turn away from any sort of ""common sense"" more towards only the most rationally defensible information being carried forward.  In cases where we are ignorant, or in systems where absolutely no moderation is present it is not very likely, but in a situation like wikipedia where it's not really ""Anyone can overwrite it"" but more like ""Anyone who manages to convince other rational human beings can overwrite it"", it is possible.

I certainly favor our chances better than when the only books in existence were the religious works copied by monks and the rest of knowledge came from the half-guessed superstitions of a village full of uneducated people just making the best guess they could with no preference for objectivity or respect for any form of science.","1225509471"

I have no idea why you would think I was trying to infer that you are a nutjob -- the vast majority of what I said were simple questions as I was merely trying to follow your line of reasoning -- not parse judgment upon it.  I never once said I disagreed with what you were saying, never said that you were being unreasonable (though I might have inferred a tad ambiguous), and hardly even shared my opinion on the matter.  

&gt;None of these are remotely possible, if you vote for the ""politically realistic"" candidate.

I don't see how voting for those that have unrealistic chances of winning makes it any more possible.

&gt;The only question I have for you, is whether you would like for it to happen, and if not, why?

I'm not going to pretend like I'm an expert in political science, nor do I see it as a realistic possibility, so I'm reluctant to hold much of an opinion on the matter.  I'm not even sure I agree with the principal of capitalism, which seems to turn us all into nothing but consumers, so I guess it really depends on how theoretical you want to go.  However, and again correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think I agree with the premise that you get what you earn, and if you fall on hard times or fail to succeed for whatever reason, you're shit out of luck.  I don't think people who are in serious condition yet can't afford medical attention should be refused service from an emergency room simply for lack of money -- I believe others should feel some level of empathy and responsibility, even when it comes to precious money.  I don't fully understand the alternatives to agencies such as the FDA, which, while corrupt, can be of service to those that are not experts on what not to put in their body  -- should/would cooperations fill this void, or should people fend for themselves in the name of personal freedom (that strikes me as ideological)?

Q: What is a post-natal abortion?

A: Sometimes a mother gives birth only to discover -- sometimes immediately, sometimes much later -- that she has made a mistake. A post-natal abortion is simply the clean, efficient disposal of that ""mistake"". We at the Sweetwater Post-Natal Abortion Clinic believe this is a deeply personal choice that every mother has the right to make. Our message to mothers: it's not too late to change your mind!

Q: What are some methods used for post-natal abortions?

A: We at the Sweetwater Clinic have pioneered our own ""FF"" (Filial Fertilizer) program. The beauty of this method is that after the clean, efficient disposal, the product of conception can give back to the community in ways that the child could never have achieved on their own, and the mother can rest secure in the knowledge that she has made the world a better place.

Before you get too worried, though. Drudge is talking about a one day result, and Zogby's poll is a three day rolling poll. That is, Zogby (like Rasmussen and Gallup) adds up the average of three days of polling, not just one. That means when we do see Zogby's new tracker in a couple of hours, it will be tighter (probably a 2 or 3 point lead for Obama), but it won't yet show a lead for McCain.

Something else that should be said about Zogby is that he tends to over sample Republicans and his likely voter model reflects the trends of the last election. His poll does not reflect newly registered or first time voters, and does not weigh his poll to reflect the large Democratic advantage in overall registered voters.

Also, while it's normal for these national tracking polls to tighten at the end, the polls that actually matter are the state-by-state polls, and that's where Obama still has a stranglehold. 

Incidentally, Zogby predicted a big win for Kerry last time. He's not the most reliable pollster out there. Rasmussen and Gallup are a little more steady.

I expect Fox News will cream all over itself at Zogby's little  one-day outlier, but at theend of the day (or should I say, at the end of this tuesday), Obama is going to roll up more than enough electoral votes to make Sean Hannity miserable.","1225510710"

In preparation to whatever evidence you will set forth, [I submit to you a series of court decisions that effectively prove that you do not require a license for the vehicle or for yourself](http://www.apfn.org/apfn/travel.htm).  Unless, of course, you are doing trade with the vehicle, in which case it makes perfect sense, since you do not have a right to trade like you have a right to travel.  Relevant sections:

&gt; &gt; CASE #3: ""The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment."" Kent v. Dulles, 357 US 116, 125.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; CASE #4: ""The right to travel is a well-established common right that does not owe its existence to the federal government. It is recognized by the courts as a natural right."" Schactman v. Dulles 96 App DC 287, 225 F2d 938, at 941.
&gt;
&gt; As hard as it is for those of us in law enforcement to believe, there is *no room for speculation in these court decisions*. American **citizens** do indeed have **the inalienable right to use the roadways unrestricted in any manner as long as they are not damaging or violating property or rights of others**. Government -- in *requiring the people to obtain drivers licenses*, and accepting vehicle inspections and DUI/DWI roadblocks without question -- *is restricting, and therefore violating*, the people's common law right to travel.

Now, I am going to expand that simple argument as to why your assumption that you ""must register a vehicle and be licensed to drive"" is constitutionally invalid:

As you might be aware, a license is a permit given to people meeting a certain set of criteria, for an activity which is otherwise forbidden by law.

If you have a constitutional right to do something, then you cannot be required to produce a license to do it.  To do so would be an unconstitutional absurdity.

U.S. Americans have a constitutional right to travel.  Let me stress this point: traveling is not a privilege -- it is a constitutional right.  The manner and vehicle in which travel is executed does not change the nature of the activity (traveling).

So, since others cannot legally abridge what is a right of yours, the name of the game is to get you to voluntarily waive your constitutional right to travel.  You waive it when you register your car or yourself at the DMV.  Next time you sign something, read the forms.

So, if you ever did that, I'm sorry, you won't have much legal recourse and you are at the mercy of the DMV.  However, if you haven't, no one can stop you from driving your car.  I mean, they can stop you, but you will -- in time -- legally prevail.

In the link I gave to you, there are court case citations supporting these assertions. Including one case of one guy who legally prevailed over the absurd license requirement to exercise what was his constitutional right.

&gt; Its when its used on a public roadway that the state has a vested interest.

Yes, the state has a vested interest.  No, that interest cannot overrule your constitutional right to travel.  Laws attempting to do so are null and void.  You can baawl all about ""state interests"" here, but the fact of the matter is that federal constitutional right trumps state interest.

&gt; The fees you pay is for a license to use the public roads.

Hahahahaaha, the absurdity of your comment *boggles* the mind.

It is absurd to claim that you have to pay a fee for a license to do what is expressly permitted (right to travel) using what is already rightfully yours to use (public property).

The elementary observation that people riding bikes and walking to work DO NOT PAY said fee for use of the public roads, is evidence enough that your comment is just uninformed babble.

Hahahahahaha.  Anyway, thanks for the evening laugh, pal.  Sorry for the long post, but I thought you deserved to know this information well.  If anything, everybody should be aware of it.

As for the consequences of the null and void effect of laws requiring driver's licenses, I'm not going to deal with this problem right now, since it's moot -- constitutional right to travel &gt; consequences of abolishing an unconstitutional law.  Simple as that.  If you favor requirements for driver's licenses, then you should sponsor a constitutional amendment movement to get what you want.

But, please, don't come here and condescendingly tell me that I'm wrong, and then try to pass me a bunch of absurdities as ""the truth"".  Have a little respect.

Oh, and I will still be needing that evidence that supports your point of view.  Rhethoric about ""how things should beeeeeee"" doesn't cut it in polite conversation, you know.","1225511072"

"politics","t5_2cneq","the theory is that the voting aspect is what gives these elected officials their approval or disavowal when they do stuff. i believe change does need to happen at all levels (local, state, and national) to be effective, but the only way the people in power are going to wield that power in a way that affects positive change is if the seemingly powerless - that'd be us voters - use their surprising influence by voting yay or nay on the candidates. letting them keep their jobs is the only hold we have over them, but we, as a society, are falling down on our job. what happens at the local/state level often trickles down a whole lot faster and with more force that some of the national politics, but it's the people we vote in and out at the local/state level that represent us at the national level. 

if no one votes, or if only the politicians' buddies and bed fellows vote, then we've given them basically unlimited power with no responsibility to their real customers. and we ARE customers even if we pretend like it doesn't affect us or is so far removed from our everyday lives that we can feel justified in excusing ourselves from getting involved in using the right that hundreds of thousands of other people died to obtain. 

knowing about your officials, at all levels, IS a form of political activism that's really not practiced in this country. most people don't read newspapers or even news websites but get their info in 30 second soundbites on tv. that's not even active thinking, much less active learning or active politicking. one of the things i love so much about reddit is that, even if a large pool of the populous has a similar leaning, there are still people willing to play devil's advocate and/or produce information from a variety of sources. it's still not an ideal situation since there is so much agreement (guess there really is no ""fair and balanced""), but i would feel confident saying that the average redditor is more well versed in what's going on outside his or her personal bubble than the vast majority of the US simply because redditors are actively reading and engaging in discourage rather than having skewed information wash over them.

Now farmers in Afghanistan have to compete with hand-outs given by humanitarian groups.

I was at a lecture he gave during the development of SMP, and he had some charts comparing SMP to the other systems available.  On small problems, SMP was much faster.  On medium problems, it was much much faster.  On large problems, the other systems couldn't even solve them.

He mentioned at this lecture that when they started the SMP project, they asked for advice from the people working on the other systems, and were told it was necessary to write in Lisp.  There was no way they'd be able to get a system to work if they used such a low level language as C, they were told.

Wolfram can be frank when expressing his opinion of others.  I heard him describe Feynman once as a ""reasonably bright fellow"".  No doubt such a description would not have offended Feynman at all (and I never heard of Feynman having any problems with Wolfram--Feynman even contributed some algorithms to SMP).  But there are some people who, if someone called them ""reasonably bright"" would take it as in insult.  Considering the ridiculous advice Wolfram got from the ""experts"" about Lisp and C, my guess is that his opinion of them is far below ""reasonably bright"".  If that is the case, and it got back to them, I would not be at all surprised at some dislike of Wolfram from others in the field.

"reddit.com","t5_6","An enormous, hour-glass-shaped crater nearly 2000 feet long and 300 feet deep, Pauahi Crater has ponded lava flows in its bottom from both the 1973 and 1979 eruptions. Cracks in the crater floor coupled with the high-lava ring-around-the-crater mark on the crater walls indicate that at least some of the lava from the 1973 flow drained back underground through this crater during the eruption.

In 1979, earthquake swarms beneath Pauahi Crater alerted geologists at the Volcano Observatory to an impending eruption. 11 hours after the first quakes, steam began issuing in jets from the north rim of the crater. As the fissure tore open the north wall of the crater, lava issued in huge fountains, forming flows which crossed the road. This spectacular eruption lasted only one day, causing much damage but an equal amount of delight to the thousands of Park visitors who witnessed its fiery savagery.

"math","t5_2qh0n","&gt;If you do the math, you find that (provided the sample polled is truly random) 1,000 people will give you a prediction accurate to within a 3% margin of error.

Does anyone know how to do the math?

Another, perhaps related, statistical question.  Let's say I'm talking to someone who claims to be psychic.  He tells me that he's better than normal at predicting which side a fair coin will land on when flipped.  Let's say I flip the coin N times and he calls it correctly R of the those times.  Is there a simple formula that would allow me to calculate the probability of him getting those R flips correct by sheer luck?

Presumably if I had such a formula I would sum it for all K between R and N inclusive and then tell him he had such-and-such a chance of getting R *or more* flips correct.  Otherwise we could get a rather distorted picture of his abilities.  For example, it's probably very uncommon to get exactly 512 of 1000 flips correct, but it's no indicator of magical prediction abilities (unless you predicted that you were going to get exactly 512 flips correct, of course.)","1225512309"

One can see exposed on the walls of the crater numerous pre-collapse lava flows that were truncated during the collapse.

What I'm saying is that I think you have two choices:  (1) find a party other than the two currently big parties, or (2) become a Democrat (likely a conservative one, but, we can be rather inclusive).

You do, of course, really have a third possibility.  Continue to cling to the rotted-out hulking corpse that is the GOP, in which case you are the enemy and must be kept out of power.  Your party has proven that it is corrupt to its core and can't be trusted with money nor with our flag, and it continues to do so even as we speak.

"science","t5_mouw","I have only read the linked article, not the referenced arXiv paper, but I have two observations. First, it is not encouraging when the article opens with an error:

&gt; IMAGINE you are on a bicycle, pedalling across the cosmos. A beam of light - perhaps sent off by a distant collapsing star - zings past you. How fast are you and the light approaching each other? You are travelling at hardly any speed, so the answer will be more or less exactly light's speed through the interstellar vacuum, around 300 million metres a second. 

Under Einsteinian relativity, since you are in a vacuum, it's not ""more or less"" the speed of light, it is precisely the speed of light.

The rest of the article actually seemed mostly correct.

My other comment is that _every single mentioned point_ is actually made in [Reflections on Relativity](http://www.mathpages.com/rr/rrtoc.htm). I'm not sure when that was posted online, but it's been around for years and years. Some points are even made better; Reflections on Relativity actually makes a plausible connection between the _Greeks_ and how they were [knocking on the door of general relativity](http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s3-07/3-07.htm), though of course they were several misconceptions away from the truth. 

The importance of null spacetime intervals and the opportunities for a mathematician or physicist to derive GR much earlier (especially after the Lorentz transform was developed) are a theme that runs throughout the work, most clearly in this [early section](http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s1-07/1-07.htm).

An American president who will do things that create *peace*, or at least an end to fighting, would be much better for Israel than an American president who ""supports"" everything Israel's government does.

Bush 41, and Clinton, were pretty good on this front, and their policies created progress that was good for Israel.  Unfortunately at a critical moment, in 2001/2002, we lost Clinton too early and got Bush who let things flame out of control and barely paid attention for the first two years.  Ironically, it was Bush 41 who was considered one of the least ""pro-Israel"" of recent US presidents who did so much to move things in the right direction.

The ones who do make games that people like to keep generally seem as if they don't care too much about that market, but these are also generally the people who seem to make the most money off of pure quality rather than movie tie-ins or massive marketing.","1225512839"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","C.f. chapter 16 of Chodorov's [One is a Crowd (pdf, 190 pages)](http://mises.org/books/onecrowd.pdf): The Myth of the Post Office.  It begins:

&gt; ""Congress shall have power to . . . 
Establish post-offices and post-roads""

THAT'S HOW it all began. Out of that simple and definite Constitutional authority has grown, by ample applications of ""implied powers,"" one of the largest monopolies in the world. Its 1946 receipts came to twelve hundred millions of dollars, its expenditures to fifteen hundred millions. These figures, issued by the Post Office Department, omit a number of expenditures incident to the business which a private concern could not omit without committing an act of bankruptcy. The Department does not charge against its income any rent for the land it occupies; any interest on investment in its plant and equipment; any depreciation. It carries no insurance account, since replacement of a destroyed building is met by special Congressional appropriation; new facilities are also provided by the general tax fund, to which no refund is ever made. The Civil Service takes care of employee pensions. And, of course, the Department pays no taxes.

Notwithstanding the savings effected by such accountancy, the Department has managed to show a deficit in all but eight of the past one hundred and twenty years. Theoretically, the Department belongs to us, the citizens. Although our only prerogative as stockholders seems to be to make up the annual deficit, our self-respect should prompt us to make inquiry into the management of our business. Congress has recently made provision for raising the postage rates. Experience leads us to predict that this increase in income will be accompanied by an increase in the deficits. What's wrong with our business? Indeed, is it a business?

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt; Call me crazy

Crazy.  You'll see why.

&gt; if you have the right to lawfully rip off your creditors (by going bankrupt)

Bankruptcy law protects you from indentured servitude in cases of catastrophe.  It has nothing to do with ripping off creditors, since you can only go bankrupt if you cannot pay the debt -- and therefore, since honestly you can't pay, it is by definition not a ripoff.

It also has nothing to do with the fact that you cede your ownership right with the DMV registration, which is what we were discussing up to your random ramble.

&gt; then they have the right to lawfully get their money back by taking your car.

If your car was bought with loaned money, and you can't pay the loan, then the lender executes the loan and gets its collateral.  That is the protection the law affords to creditors.

Remind me again, what does this have to do with the DMV?

&gt; Don't you get it? That's the reason why the state retains the right to take what is otherwise your property.  Avoid ripping other people off, and you're free and clear man!

Wait a moment...

...your entire argument is that, ""since you can 'rip creditors off', the DMV has a right to take your property even when you're not bankrupt""?  Those two unrelated rambles are your argument?  And your argument is just a blind statement?  With nothing whatsoever to back it?

I cannot believe that somebody would honestly suggest that the state dispossessing you, for whatever reason they make up, is a logical and moral counterbalance to bankruptcy law.  It has absolutely no basis in fact.  It makes absolutely no sense.  It is, categorically, a **brain fart** on your part.

as far as one generation or two or three.

one generation is one person, two generations is at least three, three generations is those three people, plus 4 more so 7 people...
so the longer we live, the more generations are alive at the same point in time

think if everyone from one family lived in a house.. if you have a longer livespan you would  have more people living in that house.  If people died younger there would be fewer people living in the same house.  

over all this is why we are gaining population so rapidly now compared to 1000 years ago for example.  
SO... in the past we had (lets say) a million aged 0-40.. now because people are living longer, we have TWO million because we still have that one million between 0-40 AND we have an additional one million between 40-80 or more.

I'm sorry, but this is absolutely fucking out of control.

I understand that these laws exist for a reason, to prevent child exploitation and abuse. I'm totally on board with the idea that 30 year olds shouldn't have photos of naked 13 year olds. But more and more of these stories are coming out with each passing week and it's clear that something has to give.

A 13 year old girl sends naked photos of herself to a 14 year old boy. Bad judgment, perhaps. A child pornography conviction? Outrageous. A teenage boy looking at (or even showing his friends) a photo of a naked girl his age *is not wrong*. These laws were made to protect children from adults, not from one another.

I have to say I'm somewhat jealous of today's generation of teenagers. When I was 14, nobody had a cell phone, much less one that would take pictures. Only a couple of folks had a webcam, and it was a first-generation QuickCam that took about 0.1fps. A few kids in school had beepers, but that's because they were dealers. And it wasn't that long ago.

Moreover, though, screw ""messages,"" forget ""sales,"" the stronger argument is that there is a place for conservative realities in American political discourse.

Hell, Obama's talking about *tax cuts*. That's a *conservative* position; it doesn't magically become a liberal one just because Democrat is making the argument, just like being Pro-Choice isn't a conservative position just because Giuliani holds it.

The best argument, and one that Obama certainly agrees with in *The Audacity of Hope*, is that there is value in discourse, in the consideration of the other side of the table.

&gt; After Mr. and Mrs. Obama released their tax returns, the press quickly noticed that, between 2000 and 2004, they gave less than one percent of their income to charity, far lower than the national average. Their giving rose to a laudable five percent in 2005 and six percent in 2006, with the explosion of their annual income to near $1 million, and the advent of Mr. Obama’s national political aspirations (representing a rare case in which political ambition apparently led to social benefit).

...

&gt; In 2005, another wealthy political couple with significant book royalties was Mr. and Mrs. Cheney, who had a combined income of $8.8 million, largely due to Mrs. Cheney’s books and the couple’s investment income. Just how much did the Cheneys give to charity from their bonanza? A measly 78 percent of their income, or $6.9 million. (No, that is not a misprint.)

One other thing, as an aside, that illustrates the sheer growth in the size and scope of the federal government over the years is laid out well in that article. It isn't the point of the essay, but I couldn't help but notice it.

&gt; In the 1840s, over 80 percent of the nonmilitary personnel working for the federal government were postmasters or postal clerks. The fact that each new administration caused heavy turnover in employees strongly suggests that service with the Post Office offered more than market wages.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","For fuck sake, voting is not the moral equivalent of shooting innocent people!  Stop it with the sensationalism.

The fact is that voting is an almost insignificant act of political power.  If there is any reason not to vote, it is that voting is a waste of time.

But, by the same measure, abstaining from voting is also an insignificant act. You guys are making it sound like you have taken some great stand against the political machine by staying home.  But your abstention doesn't actually change anything.  You guys waste even more effort with this evangelism than the people wasting their effort by voting.

The only reason you people do this is so you can go to parties with your anarchist friends and tell them how great you are for fighting the man by _not doing something_. 

More broadly speaking, can we stop with the crazy idealism.  We can all imagine what an anarchist utopia might be like, but you can't expect it magically to come about by simply removing the state.  Be rational.  You need to put science, economics, mathematics, psychology and biology before ideals, because putting ideals before any of that will lead to disaster.

Understand that people are in conflict with each other.  Understand that there are scare resources in this world that cannot simultaneously used by everyone. This causes conflict.  Mathematicians and economists model this conflict as a game, and people's behaviour are shaped by forces in this game that nudge them to adopting strategies at stable equilibrium.

But there are often strategies that are better for everyone at unstable equilibrium.  If we change the rules of the game so that these better strategies are stable, then everyone is better off.

Nature has already started this process.  Compassion, guilt, love, etc. are examples of how nature changes the rewards of behaviours (strategies) so that better, unstable equilibrium become stable equilibrium.

The environment that we live in has changed drastically since we domesticated animals and started growing more food that we need to eat.  The game is different, and we invented laws.  These laws can be used to turn better, unstable equilibrium into stable equilibrium.

In as much as laws help us play at better equilibrium, they are a good thing---remember, anarchy isn't about being without rules; it is about being without rulers.  Right now the state enforces laws; some of these laws are actually good laws, and some of these laws are bad laws.  Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater by dissolving the state.  Let's be reasonable.

Let's think about ways that are smart, rational and stable, so that we are _more_ anarchistic; anarchy need not be an all or nothing proposition.  Let's find ways for a stable society to be as anarchistic as possible, but no more anarchistic than that.

Let us talk about how to implement [parecon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics) and let us criticise it.  Let us find other models and criticise them.

At the very least find something to discuss that doesn't make ararchists sound like crackpot, unrealistic, fanatical, morons.","1225515498"

I'm not a Democrat. I'm more a Libertarian who used to identify somewhat with the GOP or thought I did in the late 90's anyway. Democrats need to pay CLOSE attention to their party.

(as a side note, this bodes very well for Ron Paul Republicans. There may actually be a void to fill over the next few years)

Remember, neocons were militaristic Democrats with a world view that is based in writings by Trotsky and steeped in ""permanent revolution"". They left the Democratic party en masse years ago to take over the GOP from the inside, and it worked.

They seem to be bringing their militaristic approach (back) to the Democrats. Keep an eye out. Remember, the GOP went from Reagan basically running on Barry Goldwater's platform in 1979 to being dominated by neocons in just a few years.

In that same time frame, and just before then during Carter's administration the Democratic party went from the party that built bases all over the world and being the party [all those hippies protested against over starting the Vietnam War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_protests) ... to the party of the olive branch.

The fact that it never occurred to you that it might be offensive is kind of telling and perhaps offensive in and of itself.  You need to keep taking a long hard look at you and your party.

2.  I will NOT make any promises about how I will refer to republicans.  I perceive that party as a bunch of crooks, warmongers and in large part traitors who happen to still be running this country in to the ground.  While they are doing it, you're in here fighting ME instead of fighting THEM.  That makes you part of their gang of thugs.

3.  The 'minority support' will be welcome when they have finished their prison sentences.

4.  If you and others in your party can't stand religous nuts, where the eff were you when they started taking over in the early 1980s?  Unless you were too young back then, you were laughing at and demonizing liberals, that's where.

5.  I have not taken for granted that Democrats will win in 2008.  If we do, remember that we have lost 7 of the last 10 presidential elections, largely because we have tried to 'play nice' against a group of cowboy THUGS and because the GOP uses every dirty trick in the book along with lots of dirty money.

I personally will NEVER be in power because I'm already broke and too worn down physically from many years of hard work and paying my taxes while listening to the right wing complain about rich people having to pay some too.

You still just don't get it.

You are a clueless bigoted a-hole who is looking for absolution from the very people who have the least incentive to give it to you.

I'm not a Democrat. I'm more a Libertarian who used to identify somewhat with the GOP or thought I did in the late 90's anyway. Democrats need to pay CLOSE attention to their party.

(as a side note, this bodes very well for Ron Paul Republicans. There may actually be a void to fill over the next few years)

Remember, neocons were militaristic Democrats with a world view that is based in writings by Trotsky and steeped in ""permanent revolution"". They left the Democratic party en masse years ago to take over the GOP from the inside, and it worked.

They seem to be bringing their militaristic approach (back) to the Democrats. Keep an eye out. Remember, the GOP went from Reagan basically running on Barry Goldwater's platform in 1979 to being dominated by neocons in just a few years.

In that same time frame, and just before then during Carter's administration the Democratic party went from the party that built bases all over the world and being the party [all those hippies protested against over starting the Vietnam War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_protests) ... to the party of the olive branch.

I think you are watching the early beginnings of a party shift, again. It's like watching the WWF as a kid. The heel has switched sides again. New people for kids who don't understand the depth of the predetermined scripting to root against.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","CIA Director Michael Hayden, said the clandestine agency is using Predator missile attacks, to ""tickle"" enemy groups, to provoke a reaction.

""We use military operations to excite the enemy, prompting him to respond,"" he said!!

The agency director was jokingly referring to the policy of committing multiple mass-murders of innocent citizens of Pakistan, as a tactic for provoking retaliation by their relatives. 

This immoral terrorist act is considered to be a legitimate military strategy by the demented CIA mind. It sees no wrong in committing criminal acts, to cause others to commit further criminal acts, as a rationale for starting a divisive world war for resources, under the guise of ""self-defense."" 

The idea that committing acts of war, to cause a greater war is not only a war crime in itself, it is a product of a deranged psychopathic mind, this psychopathic mind personified by the CIA is the scourge of mankind. http://www.dockersunion.com/phpbb/index.php website forum!!

Quote UP: ""Armchair pilots at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, never leave the air-conditioned comfort of their command center, flying remotely controlled fighter bomber aircraft ...over Afghanistan, hunting for insurgents!!""

The only viable solution is that these armchair aviators at Creech AFB, be brought to trial in properly conducted courts of capital jurisdiction, after which they must surely suffer the death penalty!!

That they have waged war on Moslem communities, surely says their trials should occur under Islamic jurisprudence, and that the final death toll from legal execution, must include all the political and defense apparatus big wigs who enabled the operation, as well.

That means a lotta ppl, who are livin' high on the hog in defense and military infrastructure, are gonna be for the high jump!!

In my opinion, it screams hypocrisy that anyone would want to say using a back brake to stop is amateurish folly. If you really wnat to do this please read on to understand what I mean...

My point is: if you're barreling down a mountain, there is no way to completely stop yourself until the grade becomes reasonably level. Anyone who is trying to convince you that it's a good idea to stop on a hillside while also stressing that novices will kill themselves by using their back brake is trying too hard to sell a false notion. Downhill runs are a full commitment. You either make it down and rush or you bail and suffer. Governing your speed is something that you must do. And it is just as critical as picking a line that works for you, but you don't do downhill to 'stop'. If you're thinking this way, find another hobby.

I no longer downhill, but in my day I rode many times down Jester in Austin, Texas back in the mid to late nineties; before full suspension and decent brakes. To encapsulate the experience in one word - 'balls'. 

I quit downhilling around 1999 and switched to single track. It's much safer and you still get the adrenals pumping. It's also easier to convince the wife and kids and your insurance coverage. 

My advice to anyone trying to survive downhill is to treat the run like surfing or aikido - not like breaking rocks or Shaolin kung fu... You want to roll with it, not stop it. Feather your brakes, both front and back. It's true that your rear will lock up and you'll tailslide if you put enough pressure on the right/rear caliper or disc, but that can give you control if you're skilled. And, trust me, you don't want to 'try' this unless you got skillz. It's like playing a guitar solo. You don't want to do it unless you already know your scales and chords AND you have a passion for the music that you're playing to...

The truth is, no one can tell you the right way to modulate your speed. Everyone will have a different body and bike weight, size, frame, and proportion. Mashing down on the front brake will stop you, but be prepared to accept your fate should you suddenly decide that's your only ticket out. Catapulting, endoing, tumbling, are all real possibilities. Remember also that you're still on a mountain. Inertia is a powerful enemy.

I fully agree that putting your butt behind the seat is key to keeping your center of gravity low and the back tire on the mountain. Also, I would add that there are times when you'll want to lock your arms stiff to keep your front tire on the line you're traveling down. This is important when your vision gets so jumpy from the terrain that you can't pick up the details. However, you'll also want to be ready to drop your elbows and let the steering work itself out if you hit a patch of smooth pebbles or loose debris. It's more art than science and there's no sure-fire formula for making it down in one piece.

Most of the time I didn't brake until I was 90% down the line. Speed in my opinion is your friend when you're downhilling. The ride is more visceral and intense and you cover a lot more ground more quickly which gives you less time to think and make an error.

I also completely agree with the 'never change your track in mid-stream'. Pick your line from the start and keep your eyes shifting from the terrain in front of you to the end goal. Back to the aikido analogy. You're a samurai on two wheels. A hawk who's chosen its pray. Keep your eyes on the prize. If you lose site of the final destination, pick the next viable point to end your little piece of the ride and head for it. Never expect to scream down the entire mountain in one shot. That's suicide. Bite it off in pieces, make a strategy, and execute in phases.

Finally, if you absolutely have to come to a complete stop, put steady pressure on the front brake and pump the rear furiously. The front wheel should never lock up, but you can let the back slide as long as you still have balance. A tailslide can pitch you left or right which helps you set up for the final step... Once you've slowed to a reasonable speed, sit your body back against the side of the mountain. Yes, that's right, I said 'sit down.' Like skiing or snowboarding, pick the best side to fall back on depending on your situation and put as much of your legs, butt and bike on that side. It'll hurt, but you'll survive. The more surface area you use, the quicker you'll stop and the more you'll distribute the energy across yourself and bike, thereby mitigating the trauma. That trick, I think, prevented me from ever getting a serious fracture.

Remember it's more art than science. Work your way up to it and you'll be bragging and surging with minimal damage until you realize you've had enough risk taking for one lifetime.

So, he's wrong because while his generation may have still been in Africa today, things would be a lot better had slave trading colonists never existed.

I'm not tall, but I'm not ugly either.  And to qualify as a troll, I would have to make baseless statements like you.  At least I have based my statements.

&gt; Quote the opinion that supports this.

[Thompson](http://www.state-citizen.org/files/cites-cases/thompson.zip).  After reading it, I understand that cities can lawfully regulate the issuance of driver's permits, conditional to the fulfillment of clear requirements inscribed in law and not subject to retroactive modification.

After futilely searching for other cases enjoining cities and jurisdictions from regulating the operation of private motor vehicles, I recant my previous statements.

However, [read this](http://www.geocities.com/tthor.geo/vehiclereg.html).  It is indisputable evidence that you do not own your car, if you registered it in the D.M.V.

The pink slip of the car is not the certificate of ownership of the vehicle.  It therefore makes sense to presume that, since you're driving a vehicle owned by another person (in this case, the D.M.V.), you automatically are not driving your own vehicle and thus you no longer have a right to use your property the way you see fit.

Plus, the legal notion that the states have a right to regulate operation of motor vehicles appears to have made up by a judge: ""[So ""Honorable"" Chief Justice William H. Waste, in Watson v. Division of Motor Vehicles essentially made up out of whole cloth his quotation from Hendrick v. Maryland and ""Honorable"" Judge Paul Vallee, in People v. Kimbley appears to have copied it without even attempting to verify the quote.]""

The fact that the Arabs failed in finishing off what the Germans started is just proof of their own incompetence, continuing to this very day, as evidenced by their miserable choice of terrorist leadership.

"IntellectualReddit","t5_2qo13","[My First Post to this Subreddit]

Crop price floors are meant to protect food crop farmers; keeping their price's steady, this is meant to ensure that we always have people willing to farm corn.

However, the law of supply and the law of demand dictate a byproduct to this method.

Price floors on corn will artificially drive up corn prices.  This increases the incentive for farmers to farm corn, seeing a greater potential income.  However, artificially high prices also mean that people will not want to buy as much corn.  What happens is an abundance of crop, and less demand; therefore there will be a surplus.

What do we do with a surplus?

Corn is perishable.  We either let the corn rot, or throw it away, or give it away.

As all big decisions in economics, there are even more byproducts of this.

Giving away food to a country, say, in the form of aid, will create negetive effects for that country.

If you start giving corn away for free, crops in that area of the world become worthless, since there is a substitute given away for free.  The demand curve practically dissapears!  You can't compete with free.

It would not be absurd to investigate a link between this practice of food aid and the practice of farming narcotics in third world countries.  Farmers who can't make money on one crop, will move on to another, more lucrative crop.

In Conclusion:
I feel that the Western world practice of food aid may have many harmful side effects, such as misapplication of resources in US farms, and massive disruption of food markets in foreign, impoverished nations.

My recommendation:
We may try leaving market forces to dictate the supply of crops in the USA; however, this may put the well being of farmers and price stability of crops in jeopardy.  If we try this method, it is most likely that foreign farmers will move from narcotics to sustenance crops, to some extent.

We may also charge market price for the food we give away, therefore maintaining prices in the region.  Or, we can only give food away to areas that are in ""dire need"", where starvation is likely.  However, this is very ambiguous and not likely to make good policy, as the definition of ""dire need"" will fluctuate from person to person.","1225519481"

Uh, good way to trivialize the issue with that headline I guess.

I don't live in California but I would support the no on 8 side if I did.  What has always bothers me about proposition voting though is how some questions end up being presented in the negative. Voting ""yes"" means you don't support the issue and ""no"" means you do.  Often it is clear in the full text when voters go to put down their mark, but when making the issue heard to the public it gets painful to have to say ""No I don't want to not allow this"" when it could be made much easier for voters.

Either you need to grow a thicker skin, or you legitimately don't have an answer to my question.

If you ever care to answer it, the question still remains: Why spend time and energy in this thread trying to convince people that voting is a waste of time? What does this achieve, in the end? 

There are a few potential answers I can imagine that I might consider legitimate: one is that you view voting as a more minor contribution on a sliding scale of larger civic duties. Another might be that you're indifferent to the significance of individuals voting, but simply don't want another individual to assume moral authority over you if you haven't performed the act. Which is a different dialogue than the path we started heading down. Another argument I've heard is that voting is the equivalent of masturbation because in our representative democracy, voting doesn't actually control policy decisions.

It's often very hard to broach the subject of cutting off food aid to foreign countries.  But you hit the nail on the head.  Doing so destroys the market in those regions thus guaranteeing either dependence on more aid or death from starvation.

Another important point: Aid to those countries destroys a fledgling division of labor.  If you destroy the corn, wheat, etc. markets, you also destroy the markets for tool manufacturing, irrigation equipment, and on down the line.

In a natural evolutionary process, the gradual, small change that occurs to make a particular kind of bird has to come from an egg. generally, the egg came from parents who were not identical to the bird that comes out of the egg. This is how change happens. So, the question is absurd, since we have no clear definition for what you are calling THE egg, or even THE chicken. Thus, there wold have been a long line of birds, and at some point, you might say it has finally become what we call a chicken. But since nobody is ever there to watch the slow process of evolution, that happens across so many years....no one can say which bird was the first chicken...as there would have been a whole lineage of chicken like creatures...all of which probably tasted like chicken.

So, if a child asks which came first, the chicken or the egg, I would have to explain that it is a defective and meaningless question, asked by someone really stupid. I would advise the child to forget such stupid questions. I might follow up with illustrations of other absurd and unanswerable questions, in the way of an example.  ","1225520623"

In just a case in normal circumstances no orders or actions of such a false office holder would be valid becuase he would not have had the legal right to enter into them.

 

It's interesting to think about what the legal consequences would be if an election was held to be invalid so long after the person had held office.

 

could the vote of the electoral college be held invalid becuase it was done under fraudulent representations? tha tis the normal case with contract signed under fraudulent misrepresentations.

 

If electoral college members cast a vote based on false reports of the vote count perhaps they could recant their vote. 

All Bush executive orders and signed bills could conceivably be voided since he was not in fact president.

What would be the effect of such a thing?

It's not as clear cut as you make out. People often use it as a reason to justify failure/ not going the extra mile, but that is just shitty psychology, not drugs, holding them back. You know the type, ""I've done so well, considering X (e.g. my past drug habit/ too poor/ too rich/too fat/too intelligent etc etc)...."". Nine times out of ten, X is bullshit. Also, everyone who is quietly happy to watch the other fail will also say, ""he did sooo well considering X..., what a champ!"", reenforcing the idea that failure isn't so bad one you have had X experience. It is. It's still failure. However, the 'loser' here will now think he has achieved enough to garner social praise and stop trying where he would have continued before, as he has a socially acceptable 'excuse'.... A clever trick, but a trick never the less. I think this may be where we agree (drug bring the loser out in some people), but I think it would have been something else had it not been drugs (pregnant girlfriend, yada yada yada)... as you say, life is hard, but it's not the drugs that make it so, but still, let's agree to disagree :-)

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;""This [bit of extremism] is not real christianity, it's been distorted"" this idea is roughly the same as a scientist saying that a pseudoscience is -- well, a pseudoscience. The difference is, Science has a recourse to deal with pseudoscience -- an imperfect one, to be sure, given the prevalence of many pseudosciences, but a recourse nonetheless. Religion lacks this fundamental resource of self-regulation.

&gt;I think that if religion could come up with a way to better regulate itself to make extremism not much more than a nuisance, rather than an actual threat to the betterment of humanity as a whole, that most general-purpose antitheists would find themselves wholly out of a job.

But science's method of dealing with pseudoscience *is* science -- the scientific method that proves what is sound and what is not. By definition, faith can never gain the same ability because it's fundamentally based outside of evidence and reason. The people your sister dismisses as false Christians dismiss her just as easily.

There must be some sort of special pseudo-punishment for using a double-upvote required so that only people willing to make such a sacrifice for giving a double-upvote will think twice before doing it. otherwise we would inject inflation into the current up/down-voting system we have in place by allowing over-zealous upvoters to double-upvote everything they REALLY LIKE at that moment in time, which is exactly what their Single-Vote is supposed to represent. 

I submit this: in resepct to reddit.com's interest in selling advertising space (which apparently, and thank you, is almost null.) make a Double-Upvote option available. but available only once to an account every 72 hours. and said account MUST have already been an ""Pro-Active"" account within the past 3 months. 


""Pro-Active"" accounts fall into the following: Must have submitted at least 2 comments within the past month that have subsequently been upvoted to 10 points or more by other members of the reddit community (no penalty for downvoted comments, cause even the crazy people need to double-upvote crazy shit.) And have been an ""Active"" account for at least 3 months.


""Active"" accounts are those which have been logged into regularly and both comment and up/downvote other stories/comments on a regular basis. I.E. Maintain the curve of standard user activity. and tweak as much as needed to weed out bots primarily built to accumulate double-upvote status with the intention of abusing such rights (hence the requirement of other redditors to upvote previous user comments.)

EDIT: forgot the punishment clause...  ppl who use their special ""Double-Upvote"" cannot use it for at LEAST another 3 days, and for the remainder of those 3 days must view ad's placed randomly within the site.

Obama: Women Should Register for Draft http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08287/919582-470.stm?cmpid=MOSTEMAILEDBOX

Obama is just as insane as McCain, dont vote for either if you have any dignity left. He is a demagogue, he will say anything to get elected. Stop buying his BS. The stasi quote above was removed from his official transcript, but is in the video. 

McCain and Obama both have the same foreign policy - they both are going to keep troops in Iraq bases and put more troops in Afghanistan. Obama wants to dramatically increase the size of the military. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqMhBEYGrXU

Obamas even a fan of the surge: ""I think that the surge has succeeded in ways that nobody anticipated,"" Obama said while refusing to retract his initial opposition to the surge. ""I’ve already said it’s succeeded beyond our wildest dreams."" -Barack Obama September 4, 2008

Barack Obama is a deeply troubled personality, the megalomaniac front man for a postmodern coup by the intelligence agencies, using fake polls, mobs of swarming adolescents, super-rich contributors, and orchestrated media hysteria to short-circuit normal politics and seize power.

Obama comes from the orbit of the Ford Foundation, and has never won public office in a contested election. His guru and controller is Zbigniew Brzezinski, the deranged revanchist and Russia-hater who dominated the catastrophic Carter presidency 30 years ago. All indications are that Brzezinski recruited Obama at Columbia University a quarter century ago. Trilateral Commission co-founder Brzezinski wants a global showdown with Russia and China far more dangerous for the United States than the Bush-Cheney Iraq adventure.

Obama's economics are pure Skull &amp; Bones/Chicago school austerity and sacrifice for American working families, all designed to bail out the bankrupt Wall Street elitist financiers who own Obama. Obama's lemming legions and Kool-Aid cult candidacy hearken back to Italy in 1919-1922, and raise the question of postmodern fascism in the United States today. Obama is a recipe for a world tragedy. No American voter can afford to ignore the lessons contained in this book.

Obama The Dummy - Brzezinski The Ventriloquist
By Webster G. Tarpley
5-19-8
http://www.rense.com/general82/obm.htm

WASHINGTON, DC -- In my book Obama The Postmodern Coup: The Making of a Manchurian Candidate, I argue that presidential candidate Barack Obama is a wholly owned puppet of Zbigniew Brzezinski and his associates of the Trilateral Commission, founded by David Rockefeller. As some have noted, Brzezinski has been attempting to conceal his actual domination of the Obama campaign, for which he is the chief guru and controller. Now a rhetorical outburst by Obama on the campaign trail in Oregon has once again pointed to the reality that Obama is a ventriloquist's dummy, with the Russia-hating fanatic Brzezinski, a barbarous relic of the Cold War, acting as the ventriloquist.

At a recent campaign stop in Oregon, Obama stated:
""We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK,"" Obama said. ""That's not leadership. That's not going to happen,"" he added. If India and China's ""carbon footprint gets as big as ours, we're gone."" (AFP)

This remarkable statement reveals the true program of a future Obama administration: savage austerity, brutal economic sacrifice, and a massive further reduction in the standard of living of the depleted and exhausted US population as demanded by David Rockefeller, George Soros, and Obama's Wall Street backers. This will be done under left cover through a global warming tax, a third world solidarity tax, and other demagogic frauds, with the revenue going to bail out Goldman Sachs, Citibank, and JP Morgan Chase. The tired, discredited post-9/11 ""war on terror"" slogans will be dumped.

This jives perfectly with Biden calling for a draft and a New World Order:

http://100777.com/node/1291

THE United States would ""have to face"" a painful dilemma on restoring the military draft as rising casualties saw the number of volunteers dry up, a senator warned today.

Joseph Biden, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the prediction after new data released by the Pentagon showed the US Army failing to meet its recruitment targets for four straight months.

""We're going to have to face that question,"" he said on NBC's Meet the Press TV show when asked if it was realistic to expect restoration of the draft.

""The truth of the matter is, it is going to become a subject, if, in fact, there's a 40 per cent shortfall in recruitment. It's just a reality,"" he said.

Also see ""How I Learned To Love The New World Order"" article by Biden.

Obama advisors:
-Zbigniew Brzezinski- U.S-led hegemony...control of Eurasia by any means neccessary...probably war with Russia
-Anthony Lake- Supported invasions of Haiti, IMF/World Bank supporter, UNICEF, in Govt since 1962
-Susan Rice- Brookings Institute, Rhodes Scholar, UNICEF, CFR..""use globalization to bring down U.S""
-Richard Clarke- You know him.
-Gen. Merrill McPeak- Planned Operation Desert Storm, supports various foreign occupations
-Dennis Ross- MAJOR Israeli supporter, policy planner for both Bushes and Clinton.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I removed forty signs from public property a week ago and about a dozen popped up in their place a few days later.  For the first forty, I yanked the plastic off the wire and put it in my pocket.  It comes off easily.  Yesterday I thought I'd try something different!

I pulled up to the signs and pulled them out of the ground and casually placed them in my car in plain sight.  My goal was to look nonchalant, as if the signs were mine.  My cover story was that I was moving the signs to more populated areas where there had been problems with theft.

I now have a dozen signs in my garage and I'm going to modify them such that they say ""No on 8"", while still being recognizable as the ""Yes on 8"" sign.  I'll either use colored tape, paint, a sharpie, or removal of plastic.  Then on Sunday evening, I'll put them back where I got them.

This was inspired mostly because ""No on 8"" signs are hard to come by.  Since the ""Yes on 8"" folks have millions of them, enough to put ten around a single intersection, I thought I'd use their raw materials.  

On a related topic, I'm also surprised no one took advantage of the fact that ""hate"" rhymes with ""eight"" — a great slogan would have been ""No to hate, no on 8.""","1225521395"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was twenty and had just joined the Navy, and yeah, I was still a virgin.  I'd gotten pretty far with some girls, but fate inevitably intervened.  I was a pretty good-looking guy, but I had some massive self-esteem issues and was extremely shy for a long time, and so I misinterpreted a lot of interest that girls showed in me.

It all started at this club called Xanadu in Myrtle Beach.  I met this little red-headed gal (I don't mean ""little"" to be condescending, I mean that she was about five feet tall and weighed approximately as much as a hamburger), and we danced, and I got her number, and then I ended up calling her and we liked each other so I made a plan to go out and see her (I was on the Navy base in Goose Creek, SC).  Problem: I didn't have a car or a license.  Fortunately, this girl had a really hot blonde friend named Dana, and so I told my friend Max, who was a really cool guy but pretty geeky, that Dana liked him.  He didn't believe me.  But finally, after begging, I convinced him to go on a double date with me.

So we went to the beach, and the girls showed up with beach towels and their clothes on over their swimsuits.  I want to say this was the beach by 37th Street or something, but I might just be making shit up.  Anyway, so we talked, shot the shit, and then the girls stripped down to their swimsuits, and Max and I looked at each other and were like, ""8),"" and then we stripped down to our boxers, left all our shit on the beach with the towels, and went out to go night swimming.

Of course, what we really did was pair up and talk, and after a while Max and Dana went back to Max's car to sit and talk.  Leaving me and my date alone in the ocean.  We were the only two people out there.  It was a warm night, but we stayed pretty close to each other, and after a while we started kissing, and then we moved a bit more into the shallows and started making out a bit more vigorously.

Things were getting pretty hot and heavy, but I was pretty awkward and unsure of myself so I think it probably took another hour before I was convinced that she wanted to have sex with me.  There!  Right in the ocean!  So I started trying to slip aside her bikini and maneuver her around in such a way that I could penetrate her.  I'd never fingered or gone down on a girl and was sort of unfamiliar with the female organs and the angles of ins and outs and so on.  Long story short, I was trying to have sex with her, but I'm not sure she even noticed.

Meanwhile, the water level has been rising around us, and occasionally we're getting gulps of nasty-ass South Carolina ocean water from tall waves.  I think ""no problem, we've just been drifting out to sea a bit,"" and I pick her up and carry her a few feet more toward shore and resume trying to pork her.  But this happens again, and another time, and I make a conscious effort not to move my feet anymore, but I still have to move in again.

FINALLY!  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm coming into the oval office.  Unfortunately, salt water mixed with sand and seaweed and shit isn't a very good lubricant, and it was kind of rough going, and I slipped right back out.  But that first penetration is what counts, right?  Right?

I kept trying valiantly for a time, more out of some animal fear (""If I can't lose it now, I'll *never* lose it!"") than any actual physical desire, because now my throat is hurting and I have seaweed in my asscrack and my dick hurts and I can't even see the contortions of violent ecstasy on her face, which is now so salty that I can barely even kiss her anymore.  Plus, my hands are too busy lifting her diminutive form off the ocean floor to, like, touch her boobs or anything.

So after a while, I'm totally exhausted, and I kind of meekly lower her, and she leans her head against my chest and says something.  ""What?"" I ask, and she says that her bikini bottom came undone at some point and floated away.  Well, shit.  Oh well, at least our clothes are on the beach.

....

Apparently, in the period of the few hours or so that I spent trying to get my end in, the tide came in.  Now, I'm just a country boy from New Mexico, so I don't know nuthin' about tides, but I thought they were slower and not that big a deal.  But when my date and I emerge, exhausted, from the water, we find that our clothes are gone.  My date's shorts are missing, and the beach towels she brought.  And my pants, my shirt, my watch, my wallet, my cell phone, my socks and my shoes.  I'm wearing nothing but boxer shorts, and my date's wearing nothing but a bikini top.

It all worked out alright.  I ran back to the car, my date sneaking a few feet behind me with her hand cupped over her crotch.  And Max and Dana were just sitting there talking, cheerfully, not breeding or anything, and they opened up the car pretty quickly when they saw the looks on our faces.  Max, thankfully, had a random pair of swimming trunks and a t-shirt that fit me and Dana gave her shorts to my date.  All was well.

Of course, I hadn't actually lost my virginity yet.  This is just the beginning of a very long and horrible story with unpredictable twists and turns, a story of excitement, terror, and sadness.  A story about compulsive sexuality, beach detritus, and *frenulum breve*.  A story of hope.  But mostly, a story about how big of a douchebag I was when I was twenty.

Another possibility is that he wanted to know an atheist perspective even if he had no intention of changing his mind. Regardless, jumping down his throat does no good. If he is looking for answers, you just turned him off. If he is trolling, you just fed the troll.

We should never stop telling the truth, even when faced with ignorance or intimidation. Likewise, I think we should treat our opponents with respect, even when we receive none from them. Even if it is impossible to change their minds, which I agree is the case with many, my way does no further harm to the individual's opinion of atheists, does not give them any propaganda ammo, and may in fact arouse the curiosity of those who are not seriously invested in the creationist movement and could be swayed.

I don't believe that the type of creationist who would troll an atheist discussion group looking for a fight would find anything to revel in about non believers going out of their way to be polite. In fact, the type of person you seem to expect would probably be disappointed once it became clear that there wasn't going to be an argument.

Additionally: This particular chart is a little confusing. First of all it's net reserves (non-borrowed minus borrowed) and right now the FED is dumping a ridiculous amount of 'cash' into the system to try to push lending. So much so that even though their TARGET fed funds rate is 1.00%, the EFFECTIVE rate has been hovering around 0.30%.

So with the FED dumping all this 'cheap money' out there the banks are accepting it and counting it towards their reserves. Bank reserves are actually HUGE right now, as the 'excess reserves' graph illustrates: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCRESNS?cid=123

This shows where most of the money is going; right into fed funds overnight accounts with the Federal Reserve. http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/WRESBAL?cid=123

So in conclusion: The story's graph doesn't show WHY the FED is acting like the world is ending. It's showing what the FED is DOING as a result of the world ending. Repeat after me: correlation is not causation.

The rest, as you put it is the ""nature of humanity""  I'm not really game for that debate, online.

One final point, although, ""faithful institutions"" are viewed through the prism of contemporary politics and historical time periods.   They are as flawed as those who are a part of them.  You can make same remarks about philosophy...  The idea and its impact on individuals cannot be judged by any calculus I know of.

I ordered these seeds from the Netherlands (feminized White Widow) and they included 10 random seeds.  So, I got 10 WW seeds in one pack, and 10 random seeds in the other.

I planted two of the WW seeds a couple months ago, but one never grew and the other one turned out to be a male.  I got mad--these were supposed to be *feminized* seeds!

The whole system was constructed in an era before communications and reasonable means of travel, and so a lot of the mechanisms are predicated on that state of the world, but the US fetish for ancestor worship (sorry, ""original intent"") doesn't allow that to evolve.

There *should* be a constitution, and there *should* be significant hurdles to amending it.  But the current state of affairs is that there is no realistic possibility of any constitutional amendment ever passing.

Between that, the split of powers between the federal and state governments, and the divided branches of the federal government, political parties can promise much, but deliver little.  This built-in bias towards inaction  causes a cycle of political promises -&gt;  thwarted -&gt; more extreme promise -&gt; thwarted -&gt; skepticism/apathy.

And as long as the voters can believe they want something without any danger of it actually happening, they are encouraged to be irresponsible and swayed by extremists.

Of course it's not above criticism.  But this isn't *valid* criticism.  You're saying they should coddle the player and never let him do anything that might make his own life difficult.  I mean, why not just hand him some power armor right outside the Vault, if that's your attitude?  Or make sure the character doesn't ever have any insulting dialogue, so there's never any chance of them pissing off the wrong person?

That you can behave in incredibly stupid ways, screw YOURSELF over, and yet still have options to complete the game is a mark of how remarkably well-written the two games are.   I'm really not sure how I can possibly explain this to make it more clear - they give the player INCREDIBLE numbers of options, yet every path is scripted such that (barring finding one of the numerous bugs) they player can still get to the end of the game.

And as far as missing out on weapons and subquests, there is no such thing as a game of Fallout in which you can access ALL subquests.  At least not of which I'm aware.  The choices you make all game dicate which subquests are available to you.  The fact that there are so many, to the point that you can play it several times and only experience maybe 50% of the same content, means it has incredible replay value.

1) Africa is mostly messed up now because of all the previous messing around in the continent. Most of the borders were drawn up without tribal populations in mind, and many of the slave raids were conducted by actual africans, who sold off the people for increased arms and services from the Europeans. After the dissolution of those empires, disarray led to corruption and the current state of things across the continent.
2) Many families died out due to slavery long ago. Those who survived to have children, who had children up until today were lucky, or some other trait. Sure, he's here, but how many aren't because of the harsh voyage over the atlantic, the accidents and tragedies in the fields, the other insults and injuries? 
3) Analogies make things clearer: Imagine a native american child proclaiming he was glad for the European colonials because Natives can now have casinos. Or, hawaiians being happy about the total dismantling of their monarchy and society because jobs are now plentiful across the island chain.

The important thing to keep in mind is that it is short-sighted to say that he isn't wrong. The ones who disagree died long ago. His predecessors might have complaints, but not the same as those who were wiped out completely due to disease or similar travesties.

The history how the red cross started is pretty interesting... The whole thing started based on helping those the people who needed help. And not limiting it to those who were of the right side/race/religion needed it. 

It is also why Red Cross use the crescent moon symbol in the middle east, as to not be associated with the Christian symbol of the cross.

Here is the thing I've found with college.  You can learn more in shorter amount of time and with a lot less money and bullshit if you buy a few good books off Amazon and focus on them.

Most colleges are jokse.  First they don't fail students.  They should.  They should fail 50% of the students, that would promote students to actucally try instead of seeing how much they can fuck off and still slide by with a B-

Secondly, tests should demonstrate WORKING knowledge of the subject.  No more multichoice bullshit.  I've been in ""Advance Programming"" classes that passed students that couldn't even get ANY of their fucking code to compile.  I've been in Art (drawing) classes that had Multiple Choice tests.

Third, we need to stop giving bullshit degrees.

I am not going to bother to respond when you put words in my mouth like that. This isn't the Internet Olympics, you aren't going to win anything by arguing against a strawman. I would be happy to continue the discussion if you'd spend two minutes actually reading what I wrote, instead of just making shit up.

(Hint: I've never said anywhere that the player shouldn't be able to screw himself over, only that the game should make the player aware when they are making a significant decision. Particularly when the game in question is full of funny and sarcastic dialog which, in most cases, has no negative effect.)","1225522520"
"worldnews","t5_2qh13","All good points, and I guess I agree with you.  Your usage of the term 'un-American' (or whatever nationality), though, becomes largely meaningless, except in a technical legal sense.  This is certainly not the way the term seems to be used in the US or here in Australia - indeed, it's intent, when used, is largely one of highlighting division and otherness.

For example, in Australia, there is a peculiar cultural mythology around the concept of 'mateship', which is essentially a kind of sticking up for your friends during hard times (a very poor interpretation, but hopefully you get the idea).  Certain politicians here tried to tie in a nationalistic concept of 'Australianness' with the idea of 'mateship' - it's what makes us Australian.  But of course, that's complete bullshit - as though no other country or group of peoples around the world exhibit the same characteristic.

When the epithet un-American is thrown around, it's not used in the specialised sense that you've defined (to refer to the specific combination of legal rights/principles embedded in your constitution and statutes).  It's used in a jingoistic manner to imply that the person is either an outsider (not one of us) or is a traitor to the group.

My problem with your original point was that in arguing for an alternative usage of un-American, you're still drawing an implication that being un-American is a bad thing (as opposed to the neutral, technical sense in this recent post), because it implies that you're violating some kind of moral principle (eg. democracy, freedom, etc.) recognised by the State.

If that's the case, then why use the label un-American?  If it's wrong, it's wrong not because it's violation of a principle that any particular nation recognises formally as being morally right, but surely because it's a moral principle per se.  Much better, say in the case of democracy, to call something undemocratic, or in the case of justice, unjust, rather than un-American.  The only advantage to the latter is that it's a not so subtle call to nationalism, which in my view is a dangerous, slippery and anti-intellectual slope, no matter who uses it.","1225522528"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","While I was exploring part of the map, just looking for new places. I came to a house next to a river. I saw someone just sitting outside so I decided to check him/her out. I think it was a she, but I don't remember at the moment. She told me about some guys looking for the guy that got out from vault 101. That they might still be near here and maybe I can help them find him. So I thought, I should get out of here, I don't really want to see those guys. 

I came back the way I came, and was looking around the river, and saw some dude on the other side walking around. It was a Raider, I could tell because it said ""Raider"" when I targeted him. I decided to take out a rifle and try to shoot at him, then I noticed two other people in the dock thing below him. They all started shooting back at me. I didn't have any ammo for my sniper rifle so I wasn't doing any good hits on them with a regular hunting rifle. After a few minutes, I wasn't really doing any damage, so I decided to cross the river towards their left flank. 

As I made it across, I looked for the top guy, and was getting closer so I could get a good shot at him. Then I hear some gun shots, and the Raider is getting shot. So I'm wondering who is shooting. I look to the left and there are about three people that came out of nowhere who are now attacking him (they can't see the two others in the dock below). They are just hunters or something. They didn't attack me, that was pretty awesome, they were there to help! As they kill the guy, I go towards the edge to shoot at the two guys below in the dock. Then I notice **they** are being shot at.  I look at the hunters, and they aren't doing anything. Then I look across the river, and **RIGHT where I was standing a few minutes ago** are two huge super mutants attacking the two Raiders. 

""Holy fuck, were they following me?"".

I was on that side shooting at the raiders for a good couple of minutes, so maybe they heard all the gunshots and came to see what was going on. Maybe it was good that I decided to cross the river, because otherwise I would have been snuck up on by those giant guys. 

The super mutants pretty much destroy the Raiders, then start looking at me, so I hide behind a nearby car (which is not a good idea by the way). Lucky for me, the Hunters (I really don't remember what they were called) from before noticed what was going on and started shooting at the super mutants. I got away from the car, and got behind some other cover and tried shooting at the Super mutants, only doing some damage. A couple of the hunters were already dead, and I saw another hunter out of the corner of my eye going across the river  to their flank. I was able to pick off one super mutant with the help from that guy. He tried running up to the other super mutant but got killed almost instantly (RIP that guy). 

So I made a dash across the river to get closer for better aim. I was able to take cover behind a pillar before he could see where I was. I tried shooting a couple of times getting out of cover but I wasn't really doing any damage. As I hid again behind the pillar, he yelled something like ""Get out here!"" and he kept shooting his giant minigun at the pillar I was using for cover while laughing. I took a quick peek out at him when he stopped shooting and noticed he was reloading. I got out my Ripper as fast as I could and ran towards him. 

""DIE MOTHERFUCKER""

I started cutting into him without VATS and he still kept reloading yelling, eventually I ended up pushing him off the side into the river. He screamed some random phrase as he fell in and I looked down at him just trying to swim. He was right beneath me, so I took out my shotgun, shot him in VATS straight in the head, and finally killed him.

I looked around, and everyone else was dead. I was pretty badly wounded, with not enough to eat, so I had to drink the water from the river with all the bodies in it. I got the hell out of there as fast as I could crossing the river, only to run into a blockade of super mutants down the road, but that is another story.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","First he says Paulsen made a mistake, then says, ""It is also useful to remember that the way banks make money is to lend it out, not hold it in the vault or invest it in low-yielding Treasury bonds. Hoarding is not generally a winning strategy for maximizing share prices or executive bonuses. It is also useful to remember what got us into this mess in the first place. If banks are using their new capital to reduce their own leverage, or are more cautious about whom they lend to, that's probably a good thing.""

Soo... he admits we're deleveraging our banks and encouraging lending. This is a good thing. The only issues he raises are that A) other industries are looking for handouts now (but you need not GIVE the handouts no matter how much they whine) and B) the public feels like they can bitch about every action a bank makes without any understanding (PR is its own problem, but for a successful bailout reality can not be fooled).

And he gives the alternative solution of Paulsen's original plan which has been explained very clearly by every respected economist: doesn't make any sense, and for which Paulsen himself has never made a good case.

This is something that has been virtually unheard of in the US for a long time. I suppose there are a few American companies that pay dividends, but not many. However, there *are* companies outside the United States that *do* pay dividends to the shareholders and in some cases those dividends alone make the stock worth owning regardless of the share price. In short, there are stocks whose values lie in the dividends they pay rather than in the price of their stock. Most people invest in stocks in hopes the price of the stock will go up, but there was a time in my early childhood when people were as concerned about dividends as they were about price.

You keep insisting that this is somehow different from all the other times in the game that the player is forced to make a choice between factions or groups or other people.  It's hard to go more than a couple hours in the game without making some kind of choice that affects your options later on.

And, yes, giving the player a warning when he's about to screw himself over IS coddling him.  Also, frankly, given the situation you're in at that point, if you don't think there's a good chance that mouthing off to the leader of Vault City will get you in trouble, you're an idiot.  

Either way, what you're saying they should have done is *coddling.*  And this is a game that doesn't coddle.

The game lets you make your own way in the game, lets you fuck up all kinds of ways, and yet generally still gives you a path to the end of the game.  I mean, hell, in Fallout 1 you can kill *every single NPC in the game* and STILL win.

When I was six it seemed like the streets were full, even in a little hick town with under 2000 total population.  When I was eleven it was a huge party.  A few years later I just never saw anyone.

I gave out most of a bag of candy today... but I saw only two groups, and I gave a handful to each kid.

What really made me sad was that I was so bad at giving out the candy.  I was surprised when the first trick-or-treaters came, and so I was kind of unbalanced and awkward.  The kids were my next-door neighbors, so they're used to me being weird, but still.  I remember all the people giving out candy making a big fuss over the little kids in their costumes, but I made it seem business-like.  More tragedy.

I hope that I can warm up and be better around kids when I'm older, or I hope my wife does, or maybe we'll just import my mom for Halloween.  Either way, Halloween was a big downer this year.  So cynical, so half-assed, so sad.","1225523677"

Anyway, just by chance, Federal Member for Corangamite (Vic), [Mr Darren Cheeseman](http://www.aph.gov.au/House/members/member.asp?id=HW7) had a booth there to no doubt press the flesh with the crowd.


My partner and I took the opportunity to approach him and discuss the matter. After all, there was no one talking to him at the time.

After both of us made our points as to why we are against the compulsory internet filter, it became clear that he had no idea what we were talking about and that he knew little of the matter. He also threw around the words and catch-all phrases such as ""child pornography"" and ""pædophilia"". I promptly pointed out that I believed it was more advantageous to redirect the money to the Australian Federal Police to catch pædophiles instead of pork barrel spending on a preemptive and unsustainable strategy. Other points mentioned included the filter slowing downloads, the fact that it is ""opt-out"", current filters (read Department of Education) are letting content through that is unsuitable for minors and that parents should be able to install software at their level, as opposed to the ISPs.

As we left, he said something that made my jaw drop. He mentioned, and somewhat sincerely, - ""You know, you people are the first to bring this issue up with me"".

Assuming the 48/48 split, and assuming ""Don't know"" wasn't an answer in the poll, 30% of republicans is 14.4% of the overall population (.3 * .48 = .144), which makes 45.6% of democrats and indepenents saying ""She's not qualified.""  That actually gives her 54.4% of democrats/independents saying ""She is qualified."" 

That doesn't seem realistic to me.  I'd have a hard time finding -one- democrat or indepedent who felt that Palin was remotely qualified.  I think it's far more likely that ""Don't know/No opinion"" was one of the survey answer options, since that option was present in every other poll cited by the original NYT article.

Putting ""on the internet"" last ends the line weakly, and, you know, it's a comic, so you have to end with a LOLBANG rather than a failwhimper.

And I like Ted Hughes and all (better than Sylvia Plath, at least), but the argument the guy presents seems silly.

Someone posted on that page:
&gt; I agree with you entirely, but I want to make more explicit a point I think is already implicit in your post: What's funny about the sentence is the delayed recognition. That is, we read it as ""Someone is wrong [huh? so what? people are wrong all the time] on the Internet [oh, on the Internet! well, yeah, I guess that is a different story. If someone is wrong *on the Internet*, it needs to be put right immediately. I can relate to that.

I disagree there too.  The delayed recognition isn't at all what makes it funny, at least to me.  I think it's the fact that I spend so much time arguing on Reddit, frequently to no avail.  Like right now, for instance.  Tomorrow my wife and I and her boss and his family are driving out to Zion National WTFever to hike around all day, and it's like a three hour drive out there, and my wife is waking me up in five and a half hours.  (*edit*: less, now, since I keep editing this fucking comment)  But no, I'm on Reddit arguing about what makes an xkcd comic funny.

What is funny is that the intelligent character of the strip and the intelligent reader of the strip both do the same stupid useless activity.  It's a ridiculous compulsion common to a subset of the population that prides itself on being logical.  And of course, being in bed with a li'l female stick figure is infinitely preferable to arguing with imbeciles on the internet... but here I am.

The emphasis on ""is *wrong*"" dramatizes the situation, making the argument seem like it really matters.  It doesn't.  Go to bed.

Flash and Silverlight have sockets but use an out-of-band security mechanism to enforce cross-domain policies. This has its own bag of issues, but it might be the better approach. Simply allowing ""same-origin"" sockets has problems as well. (Consider shared hosting environments.)

In addition to these people, I think there would be a large percentage of blacks who vote for a black person because he speaks to their issues. This isn't racism, though.

In the comparison between Clinton and Obama, you ask a good question - were blacks voting for Obama from racism?  The numbers might suggest that maybe they were.  However, as a white Obama supporter, I could just as easily suggest that a large portion of that group accurately perceived Obama as the better candidate who spoke more to their issues. 

I  thought Hillary was obviously lying and manipulating, and I don't trust her to represent my interests as much as I do Obama. Perhaps she got too many *extra* white votes because they were racist, while Obama got the extra black votes because they perceived him correctly as the better candidate.

Since Obama beat Clinton, except in older more racist white neighborhoods, this factor seems very likely. 

The real test would be if the Republicans were to run a ticket with an elder black man with a lot of the same qualifications as McCain.  Would African-Americans vote for a 3rd Bush term if he were black? I think not.","1225525297"

In his published oral histories, which he called guerrilla journalism, Mr. Terkel relied on his effusive but gentle interviewing style to bring forth in rich detail the experiences and thoughts of his fellow citizens.  For more than the four decades, Studs produced a continuous narrative of great historic moments sounded by an American chorus in the native vernacular.  Mr. Terkel’s book “The Good War: An Oral History of World War II” won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction.

The only difference between the two is that one relationship is with the opposite sex while the other is with the same sex. Everything you listed is attributed to human sexuality, and not just homosexuality.

Emphasis on sex is very prevalent in marriages or long term couplings. It's why drugs like Viagra, Cialis, and Lavitra are big business for pharmaceutical companies. Sex is not just a form of carnal desire, it can also be a form a physical love.

AIDS is not a ""gay disease"", it is a sexually transmitted disease that affects people of all races and sexual orientations. Attributing it to any single group is misinformed and ignorant. A straight women is almost as likely to contract AIDS or any sexually transmitted disease as a gay man if she were to practice the same promiscuous behavior. 

Have you never heard of swingers, swinger parties, key parties, or wife swapping? Look at the average amount of partners a college student has slept with. Promiscuity is prevalent throughout human society.

The bigger protest was about the jailing of Palm Islander Lex Wotton, after an aboriginal death in custody - where police beat a man so badly his liver *split in two* and got away with it - which caused riot to break out. Lex Wotton was charged and convicted for ensighting riot.

So, like I said, the Brisbane protest was overshadowed - and stood no chance. I'm just glad none of you were there when the march arrived - because lemme tell ya. If you were all there, protesting no clean feed, right at the same time people protested this - there may have been a bit of blood.

Apathy is passive acceptance and numbness and acquiescence in the face of pain and unhappiness in the world.

Buddhism is different.  While Buddhism acknowledges that suffering is part of all life, it does not ask you to accept this sorrow unquestioningly or numb yourself to it.  Instead, it asks you to realize that all things, including suffering, are impermanent, and since they are only temporary, not to get too worked up about them.  It also offers an 8-fold path to the cessation of suffering -

A poor political move? It's been a poor political move since we didn't find WMD's. Bush's poll numbers are in the shitter. 

Obama won't make political moves until half way into his first term.

Gravel, Kucinich, and Paul were calling the front-runners on this shit early in the primaries. The general public and the media are focused on trivial bullshit.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Man, i'm glad that I'm not the only one that pretty much would like to erase the first time.  My story:

I was 21.  I'd met this girl online and we'd talked and was local to each other.  We met up and immediately sparks flew.  We are going out about every night for months.  I had actually waited on my own accord (mostly) as i wanted that ""special one"" I'd been preached to about.  I figured if she wasn't it, noone was.  We had done pretty much everything but have sex at this point.  We'd discussed it and agreed on the next day.

So the day rolls around, we're messing around on the couch and make our way to her bed.  We had planned this out and had a condom at the ready.  She hands it to me, and i've seen the videos.  Looks simple enough.  However, when you're nervous you don't realize the condom is reversed and instead of rolling down, i'm trying to roll it in reverse.  I know something is wrong but i'm guessing it's my lack of skill.

So i get this thing partially on and nerves being nerves, things start to... fall apart?  She decides to help and i have to take this thing off now.  I finally get the thing off of me and am soon again ready to initiate application of said condom.  However, i've heard you're not supposed to use the same condom again (remember, I got no idea at this point) and we'd only planned to do this once.

So I hop in the car, I'm doing 90 down the road, she's calling me on my cell phone to hurry up.  I run into the store, practically yell ""I NEED CONDOMS!"" they put a box down, it comes to like 11 bucks and change, i pull out 15 throw it down, grab the box and bounce.  Run into the house, pulling my clothes off as i go leaving a trail behind me as I bust through the bedroom door to find my girlfriend standing there... with her mom.  I'm in my boxers holding a box of condoms and grinning ear to ear.  Her mom is standing there, completely bewildered at this man busting in her daughters bedroom, holding a box of condoms, wearing boxers and a ""I'm about to get laid"" smile on his face.  I immediately turn around, grab my clothes, get dressed as i'm going out the door, get in my car and go home embarrassed beyond words and horrified that this was all going to end badly.

Later that night, we make plans again for the next day.  That day was the day i lost my virginity.  But sadly, it's the day before that i'll unfortunately remember the most.","1225529133"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Firstly I'd encourage you to go back and read my original post as I've added several more paragraphs to it that I think are worth redaing.

I'm glad you liked the ""legitimate ignorance"" phrase, but you ascribed to it a different meaning than what I meant. I was basically saying ""the modern-day politician has legitimate reason to fear that, say, voting the right way on a bill will be mistaken by constituents as going against their will. They have to worry, for example, that voting against an Iraq spending bill will be seen as ""not supporting the troops"" rather than trying to end an unpopular and wrong-headed war. In other words, the people are so ignorant that an honest politician would probably wind up with his own well-meaning words and votes turned against him in the next election. I was watching the David Price vs. B.J. Lawson (a North Carolina congressional candidate and favorite heir to Ron Paul among Paul's suppporters) debate last week, and Price kept citing things like the NIH, Dept. of Education, etc, saying ""I believe my opponent considers these things unconstitutional, and he hasn't said a word in response each time I've brought this up."" And Lawson continued to ignore the comments rather than respond (except for a weak attempt 30 minutes later in his closing statement), because he probably realized that the audience was so lacking in understanding of constitutional law/theory that any attempt to explain those positions in the short timeframe of a debate would be impossible and likely backfire even more than continuing to ignore Price's frequent incisive comments. That's a good example of what I mean by ""legitimate ignorance,"" it's a sympathy for the well-intentioned politicians, not the American people. If Lawson had tried to respond, the honest response would have had to be ""you (the audience) are too unfamiliar with the constitution for me to explain these positions in the time I'm given here today."" So basically telling the audience they're ignorant. And that doesn't help you win votes because it's sort of built-in to the definition of ""being ignorant"" that you don't consider yourself ignorant and take offense to the phrase even if, objectively, it's true.

Further, I don't think the people are justified in their ignorance in the way you described. For the middle class, I don't think it's as hard to keep track of whether politicians are serving the public interest as you suggest, because they need to find only one example of betrayal to draw a conclusion. Especially if you have a computer and an internet connection. Look at how much time people spend having superficial debates among friends/family and watching TV coverage of politics. If they would spend a little of that time doing some modest research, they would know pretty quickly. And it's the chattering classes that really shape the elections. If the middle class had the right points of view, it would filter down to a certain extent to the poor. To another extent it wouldn't, but that's ok, because as I said, even a small minority can be very powerful, and the middle class are in fact a very large minority.

And the poor arguably get screwed over the most by the status quo, so they have the most to gain from committing the proper time even if it's difficult.

The standard for ""serving the public interest"" should be so strict that you wouldn't need much evidence. We should not be tolerant of political corruption at all. Find one example of a politician acting counter to the will of the people, and that should be it. In real life personal relations you only really get one chance, as soon as you do something blatantly disloyal you're typically gone, and if you're not, it's because your friends/family/spouse weigh your disloyalty against your long history of loyalty. In the case of politicians, we have no close history with them, they're doing a job, and even a single act of intentional disloyalty should not be tolerated.

You probably ask, ""well, if both major praty politicians are disloyal, at least one of them will be elected."" That may be true, but if people would by-default vote against the disloyal incumbent, that would be a major step forward at least. It is our willingness to compromise on integrity and be ""understanding"" of the fact that politicians have to sell out to stay in office, that has led us down this slippery slope of increasingly-flagrant  betrayals. Why are we sympathetic to the ""career politician"" protecting their career. Plenty of people are willing to be non-career politicians, serving a single term or two, for their country, and then returning to their original field of work. Holding an elected office should be considerd ""public service,"" not a professional career. 

The process for winning a primary election is quite a bit easier than winning a general. Any time the impassioned  minority succeed in getting a fresh challenger through the primary process (as they did with BJ Lawson), if the public would say ""well, this guy is a newcomer to politics so we don't know if he'll betray us, but he's better in that sense than the incumbent politician who has ALREADY betrayed us,"" that would make progress in American a bit more of a reality at least.","1225529742"

&gt;In Theravada Buddhism's Pali Canon, the phrase ""middle way"" is ascribed to the Buddha himself in his description of the Noble Eightfold Path as a path between the extremes of austerities and sensual indulgence. 
&gt;
&gt;Thus, for the attainment of Nirvana, the Middle Way involves:
&gt;
&gt;    * abstaining from addictive sense-pleasures and self-mortification
&gt;    * nurturing the set of ""right"" actions that are known as the Noble Eightfold Path

What you wrote isn't wrong, but its not realistic. Giving up on all of your dreams, giving up on love, giving up your belongings - basically means living all alone and homeless and being happy with it. 

Thus the Buddha came up with the Middle Way. You don't have to make yourself suffer by giving up everything, but you also shouldn't spend your life trying satisfy all of your greed and desires. Avoid those 2 extremes. You would accomplish this by following the Noble Eightfold Path, which basically tells you: don't say/do anything that would make you an asshole, don't do addictive things, etc... kind of like the 10 commandments in Christianity. 

So the attitude is kind of like: Be happy with what you have now and where your life is headed. You don't need to be a multi-millionaire banging girls every night, but you don't need to be a hobo either.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The first time I ever actually had vaginal sex is I guess what we're calling losing virginity here. So, in my case, I was 17. There was this girl named Jen who lived in a big city about 2.5 hours from where I lived which was a small town. I had met Jen during a interscholastic meet (a thing for school where we went to take academic tests, etc.) and chatted with her. She said various snarky things to me and was pretty cute. She had brown hair and really nice clear pale skin. Jen was into the Dead Kennedys which was one of my favorite bands at the time. I think she might have been 14 or 15 years old. I'm not sure I ever really knew her exact age.

So, one day I was going to that city for another reason and I had written to her or something and she had asked me to come meet her. She was at a friend's house that day and I arrived in my parents car (which I always drove on trips due to its being the more reliable car) which was a red 1983 Ford Thunderbird. This was in 1989.

I went into the house and sat down on the couch with Jen. The friend (female) made herself scarce while Jen and I chatted. I don't think I said two words to the friend. Anyway, we started making out. 

At the time, I often would lay on top of girls and hump them with our clothes on and lift the shirt and suck their tits, put hand down the girl's pants, etc. until I blew my load right in my pants. I had prior to this had a serious girlfriend named Cindy where we did that all the time. Cindy was willing to go all the way, but I didn't want to for various reasons the main one being that we always made out in my car (which was a 1973 Buick LeSabre) and I didn't want to get naked and have sex in the car. Cindy and I didn't have a good place to have sex, plus I was afraid of getting her pregnant.

So, I was making out on the couch with Jen and humping her and blew my load. Then, I kept making out with her and then got hard again, and I thought why not ask her to have sex with me. I figured that the worst that would happen would be that she might say no. She just yelled to her friend ""hey &lt;so and so&gt;, we're going to use your mom's bed!"" and then led me into the bedroom.

We sat down on the bed and I remember watching Jen take off her shoes and thinking it was weird because I had always envisioned removing the girl's clothes from her, but she took her own clothes off.

So, then we were both completely naked and she laid down on the waterbed. It was the first time I was ever completely naked in front of a girlfriend. Girls had seen my penis before and done various things, but this was the first time completely nude. Waterbeds aren't that great of a place to have sex anyway, but I didn't really know that at the time. I ended up banging up my knee on the frame. I didn't really care, though.

I got on top of her and starting kissing her and trying to press myself into her pussy. I didn't realize that she would need to be wet first, so it didn't really work. So, finally I kind of ""gave up"" on it and just started making out with her. That got her excited enough that her pussy got really wet and then I was able to work it into her slowly. So, then I started pumping in and out of her.

I should mention that we didn't use a condom. I had one with me, but I didn't really know how to use it and I was too embarrassed to even mention the condom. The only reason I had it was because a friend gave it to me and I put it in my wallet like maybe a month before. I was with a group of friends and we went to one guy's house during lunchtime at school so that we could get stoned - and he took a condom and gave it to me in front of everyone. I didn't know what to do, so I put it into my wallet which is why I had it with me when I had sex, but didn't use it. I had never even seen a condom before I saw that one. I later used it with a different girl named Amy who knew how to use condoms and would only have sex using a condom. (Amy lived in yet another town and came to visit me and stayed at my house. We had sex on the couch in my parents living room while they were asleep. That was quite nerve racking! I remember later disposing of the condom and the wrapper into an empty coke can so that my parents wouldn't find it in the trash.)

So, I pumped in and out of Jen for a long time. I didn't cum in her because I had already cum in my pants before. It was hot that day and the house didn't have an air conditioner on. So, we were pretty sweaty. I remember that our bodies made a weird sound (a little like a fart) when our chests would press together.

Finally, I looked over at the clock and realized I had to be somewhere else and that I was late. I guess I could mention where I was supposed to be. There was another girl, Christy, who I was friends with who lived in that city. She had agreed to be my date for my high school prom and I did have some romantic feelings for her, but we hadn't really started being a couple yet. Later Christy and I were a couple - sort of, but not quite at that time yet. I felt a bit intimidated by Christy because she was really outgoing and self confident. It almost seemed like she was older than me even though she was actually a year younger than me.

So, I left Jen and got dressed and drove over to see Christy. I ended up hanging out with her for a while and we did whatever it was that we were supposed to do together that day. Maybe just spend time? I don't remember that detail. I do remember thinking how weird it was to be with Christy right after I had fucked Jen and lost my virginity. Christy never found out about the fact that I had lost my virginity that day or about Jen at all.

I never told Jen that it was my first time. I never saw Jen again and only got maybe two more letters from her in the mail. In one of the letters she said that she was sad because her boyfriend lived 2.5 hours away (referring to me). It made me feel happy that she referred to me as her boyfriend. She invited me to see her again and speculated on whether she might have become pregnant from me. I was picking a college at that point in my life. One of my choices would put me right near where Jen lived (and near where Christy's dad lived - her mom lived in a town closer to mine - 30 min away). Another choice was a college that was maybe 45 minutes from Jen. A third choice was a college in a completely different state that was hours and hours away from where I lived and not at all close to Jen.

It was during that time that I decided to go to the college in the other state. Being close to Jen was not a consideration for me in making that choice. So, I told her about that in my next letter to her and also told her that I couldn't come to see her when she wanted me to because of a schedule conflict (I had to be somewhere else that day - I think I had to be at a freshman orientation in the other state). I recall that she did not really take it very well. Her last letter wasn't really mean or anything, but I could tell that she was sad and felt a little rejected by me. And I couldn't really blame her for feeling that way.

If I had chosen the college near where she lived, then maybe I would have had her as a girlfriend in a more serious way - although probably not since she was so young and I was really more interested in Christy anyway.

Isolated sufferers of the disease probably aren't going to come in contact with unresistant people.
But if 1 in 10 people don't get vaccinated out of fear the level of resistance in the population drops significantly and now the disease has the opportunity to spread not just to people who didn't get the vaccine, but to people who have had the vaccine but aren't immune.
There have been a bunch of reported cases where this has [happened.](http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/08/22/measles.html)
measles in young children causes mental retardation (amongst other things, the most severe of which is obviously death) much worse than anything negative than has ever tried to be linked with the vaccine. (nothing has I think)

My problem is that not getting your kids vaccinated is it is ultimately incredibly selfish. You are basically getting all the benefits of modern vaccination programs without any of the risk other parents take (which are very small).

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'd say if all you do is vote, you have no right to complain. I'd consider someone who doesn't vote, but is educated on the issues and spreads that knowledge to be superior to someone who simply votes and goes home. 

Look, there's enough evidence to at least assume there's some voter fraud issues. People have testified under oath to being a part of it. Add to that the fact that your vote doesn't directly count toward your candidate. The state legislature appoints electors (US Constitution, Article II, section I. Electoral College) who PROMISE to vote for your guy. At the end, the candidate with the most electors gains ALL the votes from that state. So if you're candidate loses your state, even by the smallest margin, your vote goes for the other guy.

In addition to that, several states hold much, much more sway in the election than others. Nevada (my state) gets 5 electoral votes. California gets 55. We may as well just leave Nevada out. (Sorry to the states who only get 3 votes).

The system is designed to make it hard for new ideas to enter the arena. 3rd party candidates aren't even on the ballot in your state unless they pay money. And finally, the state legislatures are plagued by the same republican/democrat domination as the federal leg.

To me the icing is that you can't even know if your vote is counted accurately. Someone might be switching it in the back room. Most state constitutions guarantee an open, public election, but maybe 1 in 1,000 have actually read their state constitution to know that, and even less have the balls to confront somebody on it.

Forget about voting for somebody else to bring about change. We each have the duty to ensure a republican form of government for the people.

This illustrates the problem with the central tabulation of votes.  Just flip one column and bingo.  Ron Paul campaigned extensively in NH. Lots of people there really liked him.  For him to get these results is very unusual. I have no idea if it happened or not but still shows how it could easily be done.  NH Primary is a major decision point that picks the canidates.  If you could just sway a few things like this and a few major swing states and you could own the elections.  Check out Hacking Democracy at freedocumentaries.org and also this video.

"politics","t5_2cneq","About the farm subsidies, I'd argue it's for worse.  New Zealand got rid of theirs and [it worked out pretty well.](http://newfarm.rodaleinstitute.org/features/0303/newzealand_subsidies.shtml).

It's never good to ""protect"" producers from competition.  Producers are anti-social -- they want the things they make to be scarce and expensive.  Protecting producers invariably involves harming consumers and wasting valuable resources.  Bastiat wrote a great essay about protecting candlemakers' livelihoods by blocking out the sun ;)

Consumers, on the other hand, have very social incentives -- for the things they consume to be plentiful and cheap.  It is the function of the market to force producers to accommodate consumers' wishes.

Of course we are all part producer and part consumer, but you can pretend they're two different people living in one body.  In my case, I want everything to be plentiful except computer programs, because that's what I make.  Luckily for consumers, there are no tariffs, subsidies, or restrictions on who can work in my industry.","1225533042"

Where I work, we wouldn't consider hiring someone who didn't either have an intuitive grasp of complexity analysis, or had learned about it.  Frankly, it's kind of embarrassing to have a software engineering degree and not know about it.

The other thing I've found about asking for additional classes is that there's an awful lot of other stuff going on in most departments besides 'will it benefit our students'.  For example, teachers are generally full-time, and have a number of classes that they must teach.  Maybe they're full up on classes, and would have to hire more to be able to offer a new class.  Or a teacher might be required to teach an extra class for no increase of pay.  Maybe nobody in the department is really qualified to teach such a class (if they were, why wouldn't they already see the value in it?)  So, you may need to find out more about the other obstacles to getting the class added.","1225533101"

Sorry for not falling for the groupthink, but the Democrats are hardly squeaky-clean either. Let's not forget that plenty of them, including Obama himself, voted for the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act, and the F.I.S.A. Amendment that granted rights-violating telecommunications companies immunity for their actions. The Democrats have continued to fund foreign aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Obama and Biden don't plan on leaving anywhere near immediately when in office. And let's not forget, the Democrats largely _hate_ guns, even while being two-faced about it; Nancy Pelosi claimed that she has a respect for handguns and owned them, and Hillary Clinton liked to talk about how she loved going out and shooting when she was trying to win primaries, even though the both of them have worked tirelessly to stop anyone else getting their hands on them. How is that not a clear ""They're good enough for us but not for you?"" mentality. How is blatant disregard for civil rights in the form of supporting P.A.T.R.I.O.T. and retroactive telecom immunity not a clear showing of how it is, with Democrats in government considering themselves above others?

There are degrees of authoritarianism, yes, and perhaps the Democrats may be a little better in that respect than the Republicans, but it's intellectually dishonest to paint the Republicans as the only monsters.","1225533618"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Wow, that sounds pretty f'ed up.  He's basically saying that his god is more important than his respect for you.  Ouch.  That's gotta be pretty hard not to take personally - coming from your own dad and all.

And I can imagine it's tough 'cause you want to defend your wife - that's only natural.  It can't help things that they claim she's making you ""believe in Satan.""

These are going to be obstacles.  What I mean is that they're going to say things that will hurt you and will suck you in to an argument.  It's going to be tough.  

The only thing I can tell you is that you should gently remind them that it hurts your feelings when they say things like that and that you wish they cared about your feelings like they used to.  But then let it go.

Just avoid talking about religion with them and talk about the things that you need to say, and the things that remind you of the good times with them.  Tell them you don't want to be disrespectful to their religion, only that as a grown man, you have the right to make your own decisions in life and expect them to respect them just as you respect his decisions.

Tell him you don't honestly believe in a god that would be so cruel as to drive a wedge between father and son.  Tell him how regrettable the whole situation is.  How very sad it makes you.  How terrible it feels to be rejected by your own father.  Ask him if believing in god will let you have a father again.

I mean, the point is here that he has to see that he's hurting you and how terribly unfair it is.  But I wouldn't argue with him about God.  The change has to come from him, and there's no guarantee that will ever happen.  

Just tell him that you still love him and that you know Iraq must have been a totally horrible experience.  Tell him you'll always be there for him no matter what.  Basically, *youre* the one who's going to have to be the real Christian here.  He's been captured by this very insidious modern brand of evangelical Christianity that has a lot of mindguards and groupthinky characteristics.

Tell him that no matter what your disagreements might be, that you want him to feel better and not have a mind troubled by all the things that he must have seen and experienced in Iraq.  I hope things work out, but you'll have to be patient and ignore a lot of stuff from him, and just remember that his mind is injured.  Sometimes injured minds say cruel things, get angry, become distant &amp; withdrawn.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you.

But remember too, you're your own man and you have every right to self-respect that any other man has.","1225534606"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Have you talked to any Native Americans about that? 

Actually I have talked to many native americans. When I was in school my best friend was one and I spent a ton of time on the res.

Here are some things you obviously don't know about native americans.

1. Native americans are US citizens. They can vote. They can run for office. They can lobby. They pay taxes. They get receive services from the US govt. Legally speaking they are no different than any other citizen.

1. The US signed treaties with the Natives which in exchange for peace. These treaties give native americans significant amount of autonomy over their lands. 
1. When there is a dispute as to whether the treaties were violated the natives have full rights to take the govt to court. There are numerous cases where they have won hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation. In fact some cases are still going on.
2. The US has formally apologized to the natives for the atrocities committed hundreds of years ago.


The reason all of that is true is because the US is a civilized country. Despite all it's flaws it has chosen to join modernity. It abolished slavery, it gave women the vote, it made the people it conquered citizens.

Israel is not a civilized country. It's still where we were two hundred years ago. 

What's really awful is that israel's defenders (like you) seem proud of it. Hey look at us. We are still doing to the palestenians what america did to natives two hundred years ago.

It's almost as if two hundred years of progress never happened.

My theory is that this is because jews are basically backward looking people. To them history is much more important than the present or the future. They define themselves by where they were three thousand years ago. They define themselves by what happened in WWII.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","They are not interesting. They are the self serving musings of a person whose patches were rejected.

Linus said over and over that he was going to refuse to accept the patches if Con was not committed to maintaining them and supporting his fellow kernel coders. In the end con was not interested.

No matter how good your code is if there is no commitment of support it has to be rejected. The fact that nobody else stepped up to support the code tells us that the code was probably not that special. The supposed advantages were not compelling for anybody.

I saw the benchmarks that Con himself published and they didn't strike me as being any better than the competing patches. Given that his code wasn't all that much better and given he was not willing to support his code linus made the right decision.

So stop bringing it up as if it means something. Patches get refused every day. People leave in a huff every day. 

For every person who stops developing for linux there are more who start. That's the way open source works.

How many patches to the windows kernel were refused by the program manager? How many windows kernel developers quit? how many were fired? How many managers came and went?

If linux sucks because con quit doesn't this means windows sucks even more because hundreds of kernel developers have quit, been fired or reassigned to other departments? 

Stop making yourself look like an ignorant retard by bringing it up as if it means anything.

You can't have it both ways: either the cloud is the result, or you need to-the-last-bit repeatability, or you have catastrophic failure. Only in the first case you have the luxury of being oblivious to the workings of floating-point and getting away with it.

After all, if you read Kahan's papers, you'll see that the intent behind IEEE 754 was to enable that very 95% of the cases where you can be oblivious and get away with it. The history of supercomputing is littered with the cadavers of numerical analysts fallen in duty.","1225536624"

This is not an issue in which we need to gamble.  If you don't have the answer, then you should not be repeating this talking point.  Making important policy decision based on alarmist assumptions is a fool's game.  Extreme over-reaction to climate change could be as bad, or worse, than no reaction at all.

&gt;That was in times were there wasn't the additional output of green house gases by us. Nobody denies that the climate went trough changes before human activity, but now there are the natural causes plus human output on a grand scale.

And that is why we need to clearly identify how much of the current warming is natural, and how much is being driven by our carbon dioxide emmissions.  Making alarmist assumptions may work for environmental groups, but it makes for poor science.","1225537944"

Let me suggest this to you, come here for the interesting news stories, the witty banter and anything else you might enjoy. Being hung up on how many people have clicked on an inconsequential arrow could truly not be any more irrelevant. 

If you, honestly, for even a millisecond entertain the notion that somebody could be *inherently better than you*  because other people have clicked on his up arrow more than your up arrow you need to reevaluate what constitutes being a good person. It's practically as trivial as wondering if somebody is a better person than you because they were held up by less red lights than you were on your way to work. 

George Carlin said it best: ""Think of how dumb the average person is, and then remember that half of them are dumber than that!"". Now I give (most) of my fellow redditors more credit than the average person, but nonetheless a lot of stupid shit gets submitted and said here.

I don't think this is in the US government's interest, though, because not taxing farmers and not offering agriculture programs means they don't have a carrot and stick with which to direct agriculture.  They can't pay lots of farmers to grow tons of corn to be made into fuel that turn out to have no benefit.  Tons of campaign donations would shift to Congressional challengers if we dropped our protectionist sugar policies.  Everybody that uses corn fructose syrup, in place of expensive sugar, would have to make big adjustments.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Dear Pyrsorra,
A nice story of a man who pulled himself up and did something with himself. I too pulled myself up and made something of myself on my own. But you fail to realize is that when people with more money pay a smaller percentage in tax then the middle class, something is wrong. And it was YOUR wonderful president that started wars that made rich people richer (while fleecing this country) and that during this economic depression (that YOUR president caused) will not harm the rich but the middle class will suffer. Why is it when we look back on this country's history we see that when the liberals (your words) were in power the country prospered, but when the repugs are in power we have depressions? You want a two tiered society. You want it to be the rich vs the poor with the middle class squeezed out to the poor side. But in your ignorance you fail to realize that when people have no money, they don't spend it. Makes sense, yes? What do you think the stimulus checks were for? You give $500 to a rich person and that is $500 that won't be spent. You give $500 to a poor person and that is $2,500 that goes into the economy (it's an economic principle). 
As for your the entitlement issue.... john ""the maverick"" mccain is the poster child (along with this dolt in the White House) for entitlement. The finger you point at Joe Biden shows your ignorance again. You cry on one hand that giving to the poor is bad, and then complain that Joe Biden did what you think is correct. Can you really be that dumb?

So, if escaping references are rare, instead of

    T foo(scope int* p);

you should have

    T foo(live int* p);

or some such, where `live` marks `p` as a pointer to storage outliving the scope of the function calling `foo`. For instance, `free` should be marked as:

    void free(live void* data);

Specifically, it highlights average citizens and grassroots communities as the real stars of this campaign, by giving them a celebrity-style photo shoot at Obama events.  Selected portraits will be exhibited in a New York gallery show and eventually published in book form along with Stories of Change written by the portrait subjects themselves. 

Much has been made of the historic nature of Obama’s presidential candidacy, and even of the unprecedented individual and grassroots support for his campaign.  What has not been documented, however, are the faces of the individuals themselves and the specific reasons behind their passionate participation in this process.  This project hopes to honor the ordinary citizens who are coming forward, not only to endorse Barack Obama, but also to stake a claim to the future of this country through their own personal and communal actions. 

This inspiring piece includes a number of wonderful, moving photographs and the “Portraits of Americans Standing for Change” music video.  In addition, there is a great photo-gallery that presents a number of other remarkable photographs from the project. ","1225542248"

"politics","t5_2cneq","There are a lot of reasons.

Most people tend to think that aside from the fact that the US strongly supported the creation of Israel that there's a strong but small constituency in the US that has some unequal representation in our government.  There may be some truth to this but this isn't why the US tends be very pro Israel even at times to our detriment. 

One needs look at history for a moment.  The US allied with Israel during the cold war and in typical cold war fashion we used other countries to do our fighting for us instead of directly.  Israel is very important geostrategically.  We placed missiles there and pointed them at the former Soviet Union as we did in Turkey.  For that reason we were always very supportive of Israel in the past even when every other nation for instanced voted against Israel in the UN. There's also always been some sort of fear of the spirit of Arab nationalism, but that's more of a fear in the popular imagination that one that dictated policy.  It was really always about the soviets. 

When the cold war ended US support for Israel actually deteriorated a little and we became interested in helping Palestinians as well.  It wasn't till this bullshit war on terror started that the US started supporting Israel like before, but we still don't support them like in the cold war days.

There are also a lot of religious nutjobs in the US that believe we are in the end days and that Israel will play a pivotal role in Armageddon (as some sort of ally against the devil - really yeah thats what they believe).

So when conservatives speak and try to play the anti-Semite card they're really doing two things.  They're speaking towards a small but active constituency of Jewish voters that are very interested in keeping Israel sovereign as well as Americans that associate Israel with the war on terror and terrorists and such, and secondly to a bunch of religious nutjobs who think they're an ally in a war involving God (or as they consider them ""the chosen people"").

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt; You've done plenty of research, it seems, but only on one side of the issue. Try actually looking at the other side - maybe even (gasp!) try something. Maybe your personal experiences will differ - or at least indicate that the ""everything Scientology does is evil"" mantra isn't really true.

I'm not paying the Church of Scientology any money until I am convinced that they don't engage in activities such as overworking and imprisoning their ""volunteers"", and other unsavoury activities. The only thing I am able to do is use a nearby copyright library to read any book for public sale in the UK. The ""volunteer minister's handbook"" is not available there. I have already read ""Grammar and Communication for Children"", ""based on the works of L Ron Hubbard"". It confirmed what I thought were LRH's views on misunderstood words, and I was not impressed by the importance placed on picking up the technical terms of grammar. I have also requested ""Axiom booklet : the axioms of scientology, the prelogics, the logics, the axioms of dianetics"", which should be interesting as scientific studies like dianetics are not supposed to have axioms.

&gt; Now, as I was mentioning about that saying, and as I replied to in ""episode #8"": you are stating subjective claims and outright lies as fact, then repeating them. This is a far stronger form of manipulation then you will find in this video. Unfortunately, it is also why I don't waste my time with you anymore (with this post being the exception).

&gt; If you ever have the epiphany that my friend from Digg had, I'd be happy to converse with you again, but until then all you're going to do is shove the same old claims and lies at me - just to try to make me feel bad. I have no reason to waste my time, so I suggest you not waste yours - either trying to convert me to ""Anonymous"" or wasting it being part of them.

I came into this conversation, and the previous conversation, willing to talk and giving easy-to-find references. You came in mainly with references I would have to pay for to read, generalisms (""read the whole thing instead of the warped excerpts"" - why can't *you* help me put those excerpts into context?) and are apparently now only willing to talk to me if I already agree with you. I am perfectly willing to discuss and doubt the veracity of any of my sources.

I am not going to respond to the content in your posts unless you are willing to engage in an argument. This is because I already believe most observers will be able to look at both sides and determine that most of my points are, in fact, substance.

If you do want to open a discussion, I have one question for you: you have said on reddit that you aren't a Scientologist, and that there are parts of Scientology you disagree with. On the other hand, you say you have taken some Scientology services in the past, so you are probably counted among the figure of ""10 million members"". Anyway, how would Scientology have to change before you would become a Scientologist?","1225542975"

"science","t5_mouw","Actually, contrary to urban legends, Copernicus and his theory caused only mild controversy, more with scientists at a time than with Church, and Galileo had problems with Church only because he attacked Church relentlessly, since he was vain and stubborn man.

Pope at a time was a good friend of Galileo. Only after Galileo openly mocked Pope (by saying that Pope is retarded) did he lose Pope's protection. Even after that, he was given the chance to defend his views, and after he failed to do so and instead of giving scientific arguments simply attacked the inquisition was he sentenced. Even then, his sentence was as mild as it could - even under house arrest, he was allowed to write and publish.

The initial subject of disagreement between Galileo and the Pope was, ironically, that Pope defended scientific approach and asked Galileo to include both arguments for and against heliocentric view in his book, which Galileo refused. The fact that Galileo later became scientific icon is a great historical injustice.

Democrats try to sway people with by appealing to ""social rule"" and, to some extent, also fear -- though usually of different things. Those that fail to fall in line are once again strong-armed by laws, and the Constitution and previous laws can once again go fuck themselves if they're in the way.

Both parties suck, and the only real difference in the end is which one happens to be in the lead of the race to erode our rights at that time.

The confusion that these Prop 8 motherfuckers want you to buy, is that homosexuality and gay marriage are moral matters.  Since homosexuality involves consenting individuals only, there is no moral question to resolve.

So homosexuality -- and, by extension, gay marriage -- is not a moral issue at all; it is merely aesthetics or personal preference.  The crux of the issue is that the motherfuckers want you to believe it is a moral issue, so they can control and enslave you to serve their anxieties.

Don't fall into their trap.  Say yes to legislating morality.  Say no to legislating personal preference.  And call things by their name.

Addendum: those motherfuckers aren't evil -- in all likelihood, they honestly do not know morality from personal preference, because they have been perverted with lies when they were children.  Now, just because they are not *evil* does not mean they are not *corrupt* -- which, of course, they are; that's exactly the word you use to describe someone who rechristens their vices as virtues.

Yeah, I guess people in NYC are paying a little extra for a stamp because the high population density makes for extra efficiency.  But they are hardly being charged a burdensome or unfair rate.

Meanwhile, the ""socialism"" of the post office insures that people in rural areas are capable of sending and receiving mail at the same rates.

Until you show me the actual *harm*, tossing out words like ""socialism"" doesn't have any effect.  And it's strange to hear whining about a monopoly from people who think anti-trust laws should be dropped.

You need at least three companies to maintain any real semblance of a competitive marketplace.  How on earth is three sets of postal workers driving to every mailbox in America on a daily basis more efficient than one set of workers?","1225545454"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;My general impression of the church's idea of ""charity"" is that it involves using free money to create a situation where destitute people are beholden and dependent on the church for the direct purpose of proselytizing.

This is not the case in any of the churches I have dealt with.  Most donate money/time/food/items directly to soup kitchens, homeless shelters, shelters for battered women, underfunded local schools, Habitat for Humanity, relief for world tragedies, etc. -- with no strings attached whatsoever.  (In many cases the giving is done in a fairly non-public way and the end-recipients--the homeless who attend the shelters--have no idea who donated what.  No religious overtures are made to them and nothing is demanded/expected of them).  The church communities I've been involved with would be absolutely appalled if their generosity were misused in the manner you suggest.

&gt;In its most basic, least damaging form, church charity works as a low grade inefficient placement agency...

That's fair.  I wouldn't blindly donate to a church without knowing how my money will be used.  There's also the option of specifying the purpose of your donation (to start a program to donate supplies to an inner-city school, for example), rather than having your money fall into a ""general church fund"".     (Churches I have been involved with are completely transparent financially, with every incoming/outgoing penny accounted for in a public way, and the budget is decided on by committee, approved by vote of the entire church community).  

&gt;anyone will tell you who's been in that situation, the moment you express anything other than reverence for the LAWD and his earthly messengers (the clergy), you're out on your ass.

Again, I've never witnessed anything of the kind.  I have read about it and I know it happens in some very extreme, intolerant churches, but in my experience this is far from the norm.

I'm not sure whether your observations are from personal experience or biased from reading atheist blogs which tend to point out the worst behaviors of the worst churches (I read them too--those churches piss me off).  Or maybe you live in a fundamentalist area and are surrounded by these types of churches, so you're understandably suspicious.  

I've lived in mostly ""blue states"" and most churches in my experience are charitable for charity's sake, and accepting/forgiving to an extreme.  Most would adamantly oppose any of the behaviors you're uniformly ascribing to ""the church.""

Any program I click ""maximize"" on will maximize on the monitor that it's on, though I can resize programs to span both monitors (over 2600 pixels...).

I haven't played around with KDE 4 much, but on KDE 3 I could set different wallpapers for it, put new panels and widgets on it, and do everything I can do on my normal desktop real estate.  If the two had the same vertical resolution, I could elongate my taskbar and run it across both; by default it runs across only the first.

I had the same setup with Kubuntu 7.10 for a year too (I didn't have multiple monitors before that).

Is this what you mean?  If it is, look into using Xinerama, that's pretty much what it does.

Edit: And if you have an nVidia card, there's an nvidia-settings program that will take care of editing your X.org configuration and allow you to very explicitly describe which part of the desktop you want each monitor looking at.  I have the second monitor aligned with the top edge of the desktop; if I wanted to, I could align it with the bottom edge, the left or right edge (so it's ""above"" or ""below"" the first monitor) or even make them overlap in some a particular area.","1225545519"

My Grandfather could not even talk coherently for the last 2 years of his life. He could not recognise members of his own family. His great grandchildren were born whilst he was alive, yet I doubt he ever got to realise who they were. He was as helpless as a newborn baby by the time he died. In the very rare odd moment of clarity that he had where we could communicate with him, all he wanted to do was die. To say it was torture was an understatement.

"reddit.com","t5_6","It is a legitimate point. I myself posted on here (somewhere) that Japan is number 1 on a new UN rating of HEALTHY life expectancy. What that means is that overall the people are healthier and suffer fewer life threatening diseases...which means they don&amp;t have to go to the doctor. Their long life is a mixture of genetics and diet, and has minimal imput from their medical practitioners.

Japan is behind on the use of good effective medicines...I can't even buy ibuprophen in a drug store. 

I have seen numerous messed up skin ailments in people that are either not treated or treated ineffectively. for eg, I saw a woman walking down the street who literally looked like her face was melting off ala Paul Crane in Robocop...it was gross. And while waiting for the train, there was the guy waiting in line in front of me who had really gross flakey scaly purple skin on his neck. I knew a girl in Canada who had bad soriasis all over her body...and she didn't look that gross because she was getting a more effective treatment. 

I went to a dermatologist 3 different times for 3 different things, and the guy gave me the exact same stuff every time. They use lice powder to treat scabies... yeah...totally NOT effective treatment for that problem. 

Further, in japan it's true that a lot of people are pidgeon toed, and the doctors don't do anything about it, because for the most part it's not a problem (and that's fine)...but I taught a girl with clubbed feet. 14 years old and her feet were literally sideways pointed in. She had to walk by lifting each foot up over the other. Clubbed feet is a common problem among asians, and in Japan they just leave it. I mean comeon..Kristie Yamagouchi was born with cubbed feet and because she is from the US, the doctors fixed the problem and she became a champion figure skater. But here they just leave it? Seems like an unsound medical decision to me. 

And don't even get me started on cleanliness and sanitary practices in hospitals and clinics. And the rudeness of some (well maybe all of the old school) doctors. I went to the hospital because I had had unusual pain and swelling in my ankle on and off for about a 3 weeks. I told him I hadn't fallen or twisted my ankle. Buddy askes me if I was drunk (at the time the pain started). I mean WTF! Because I didnt remember doing anything to hurt myself, he thinks i was drunk. And he wasn't just saying that because I am a foriegner and obviously all forginers get blind drunk all the time...no, he would have asked the same thing of a Japanese person comming in with the same compalaint. Why? because they can get away with being shitty because the people trust them because they have the all hallowed 'Dr."" credit to their name. 

Another example. An ex co-worker of mine had a motorcycle accident and she broke her leg just before she went home to Australia for a visit. They reset it wrong and she got a major infection that she had to get fixed while in australia. They had to drain the infection and re-set the bone because the Japanese surgeon screwed it up. She said she was really happy that she was home when to get it redone because she would have been scared shitless to get it done again in Japan.

All that being said, I have been to doctors in Japan who have been trained overseas in Europe or the US, and they are actually good at their job. Unfortunately, they are few and far between. 

So no, the people of Japan live long DESPITE their doctors, not because of them.","1225546182"

I find it somewhat interesting that they are waiting until enough states join to guarantee 270 before making the switch. One of the arguments for the popular vote is that it causes politicians to ignore small states and non-swing states. Another argument is that it might encourage people in strong red and blue states who vote contrary to turn out and vote because they will feel they have a voice where they previously didn't.

They already have 50 electoral votes in the pact. If they all did this right now it, one could argue it would cause politicians to ignore these states. However, 50 is also a large enough block that it might cause opposition voters to start turning out in solid states, as they might not change, say, South Dakota's votes, but they could affect the 50 votes in the compact states. Likewise, a state like California already contains a large percentage of the population, so a Presidential candidate would be unwise to ignore them, especially if the compact is in effect.","1225546384"

You connect McCain to Khalidi because he SAT ON A BOARD that gave Khalidi 448,000 dollars for establishing some place called ""The Palestinian Center"".....it wasn't for Khalidi directly...OBAMA had dinners, MANY dinners with Khalidi and his wife over YEARS AND YEARS!!!

McCain wasn't found guilty in the Keating Five...while it was bad judgment, he was not convicted of ANYTHING....it's just something left-wingers can grasp onto whenever people start burning down NOBAMA with everything under the sun.

George Bush was a war criminal?  Hmmmmmm.  When was he convicted?  Was there a trial?  I think I would have heard about that.  This point is LAUGHABLE!  And so are you for inserting it in there to match my points about NOBAMA.

I have only heard heresy about Sarah Palin and left-wing slurs that even ALAN COMBS has dismissed.  While he still doesn't like her and doesn't think she's qualified (neither to I or any other ""reasonable"" right winger)...the fact remains...she's a governor of the largest state...she must not be that dumb.

How can you defend a man like Obama, who's wife has espoused (on more than one occasion) that she has contempt for White America.

A man who associates with SEVERAL convicted TERRORISTS, or people who were in groups labled as TERRORISTS groups by the American Govt?

A man that votes PRESENT at HALF of his votes.

A man who attended an Islamic school in Indonesia as a child.  A child who's ONLY MALE influences until he moved back to Hawaii were MUSLIM MEN.

A man who sat in a church of HATE (which we've all seen and heard over and over again...yes, I'm sick of it too)....for 20 YEARS and has the ""audacity"" to tell the public (after he was caught) that he doesn't agree with Jerimiah Wright.

A man who liked Tony Rezko when Mr. Rezko made him money and took the fall for him, but now disassociates himself with him.

A man who doesn't walk out of a public dinner for an anti-semite like Khalidi when an anti-isreali poem is read aloud.

A man who, when questioned by one of his future citizens, about his birth certificate, has it sealed and PAYS LAWYERS thousands of dollars to get the case dismissed, instead of just showing his ""vaulted"" copy of his birth certificate and his ""naturalization"" papers upon his return from Indonesia?

You are a fool if you don't think Obama is FLEECING white America...and believe me, that is his sole purpose...to get back at the ""whites"".  Period.

John McCain is no saint, but at least I know he did six years in a P.O.W. camp (when he could have left) for his country and fellow countrymen.","1225546736"
"politics","t5_2cneq","The British government as well. Remember, it was the Balfour Declaration in 1917 that got the whole thing rolling.

In 1917, just before Britain defeated the Ottoman Turks and seized control of Palestine from them, British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour issued the Balfour Declaration which stated that they would, ""view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people"" with the understanding that ""nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.""

This fell short of the goals of the Zionist lobby in Britain, since it did not actually establish an independent Jewish state; the declaration itself was woefully naive, since there were already anywhere from 500,000 to 600,000 non-Jewish Palestinians living there compared to 80,000 or so Jewish immigrants from Europe and native Jewish Palestinians.

Between the wars, Britain continued to be the strongest supporter of Zionism, but some interesting things happened. Fascism was on the rise, and while Hitler's Munich putsch in 1923 failed, Mussolini had taken over Italy. 

Author and activist Lenni Brenner details a lot of the connections in the book *Zionism and Fascism,* including how Zionists of the time sought an alliance with Mussolini and even sent letters to Nazi leaders as late as 1941, urging them to deport Jews to Palestine. 

Zionism in the inter-war years became skeptical of democracy and fell in love with a racial identity-based, authoritarian state. Zionism evolved in a similar way to the Falangist movement in Spain, and despite the perpetration of the Holocaust by the Nazi government, Zionists still saw fascism as the ideology most suited to their task - creating a Jewish state. Basically, democracy for us, but none for you Palestinian Arabs.

Britain was also not that thrilled with Zionism anymore. Jewish immigration in mass numbers was one cause of the Arab Revolt in Palestine from 1936 to 1939, and Britain clamped down on immigration. This prompted Zionists in Palestine to become better organized, clandestine and more supportive of the use of terrorist and paramilitary tactics.

However after World War 2, Britain, until now Zionism's chief sponsor government, was ruined by the war and losing its empire abroad. Two things then happened: the Greek Civil War and the end of the British mandate over Palestine. 

Facing more and more battles with Jewish militants, Britain unilaterally announced its withdrawal from Palestine. 
On the day before the British Mandate was set to expire, Zionists within Palestine declared the creation of a Jewish state in violation of the UN partition plan - and this will be a very brief description that follows - this immediately provoked a civil war, and foreign intervention. After a year of fighting (and what could now be described as ethnic cleansing directed against non-Jews by groups such as Haganah and later, Irgun), the state of Israel was declared. 

In Greece, Communists were fighting to overthrow the government there. Many of the Communists had just fought against the occupying Germans, while the government was returning from exile. The UK supported the Greek government. Into this stepped the United States, as Britain became unable to lend its support any longer.

US President Harry Truman laid out what became known as the Truman Doctrine, in reference to Greece and Turkey specifically, but offering to aid any nation or people who were resisting Communism, and implicitly, the Soviet Union.

Then, in 1956, Egyptian President Nasser (who came to power in a coup in 1952) declared that he was nationalizing the Suez Canal, and this lead to a secret alliance between Israel and Britain and France (who were the prime stockholders in the Suez Canal). The United States forced a cease-fire only after the Soviet Union threatened to intervene with nuclear weapons if the canal was not re-opened.

The Cold War and access to oil shaped the US-Israeli relationship. First, when it appeared that Arabs states could be kept in the pro-American camp (1950-1967), relations with Israel were muted - more aid was given to Jordan than Israel. After the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, the Arab states shifted more or less into the Soviet sphere of influence. This was the real turning point.

The US-Israeli relationship, therefore, was first due to Cold War, anti-Soviet policy. It was only later justified in terms of religious obligation (by Christian fundamentalists and the Israeli lobby in the United States) or ""anti-terrorism"" policy - in the eyes of the US government. 

In the context of the Cold War, Israel was portrayed in the media as the little guy standing up to a big bully, either taking on three or four countries at once and defeating them, or in reference to the Soviet Union. keep in mind, this was also in the aftermath of World War 2 and the horrors of the Holocaust. Although just as many non-Jews were slaughtered in the Holocaust as Jews, the Zionist lobby was quick to move on the implications of this and reinforce the idea that Judaism and Israel were one and the same, and that criticism of the state of Israel was anti-Semitic. 

But culturally, there was also massive Jewish immigration to the United States in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, and all of these immigrants spoke Yiddish and either Russian, German, or other European language. 

For Zionists, ""diaspora culture"" is/was also a direct threat to the idea of the Jewish state. Why? Because traditionally, Jews believed they would continue to be exiled from their homeland, in diaspora, until the coming of the messiah. Establishing a homeland pre-supposes the messiah has arrived...but he hasn't. Therefore, the state of Israel is heretical to traditional Judaic beliefs.

Yiddish language and culture is a part of that. So, after World War 2 we see a massive transformation of Jewish-American culture; Yiddish is abandoned/rejected and Hebrew (the language of modern Israel) is embraced, as well as the notion that Israel == Judaism and Judaism == Israel. Because Zionism is the foundational ideology of the state of Israel, therefore, the thought arose that Zionism = Judaism. This is deliberate. As American Jews largely accepted this, it created an instant de facto lobby for Israeli interests.

Still, most mainstream support for the state of Israel in the United States, by people like Joe the Plumber who should have no reason to have an opinion one way or the other, can only be traced back to about 1980 or so. It's a fairly recent phenomenon, tied in part to fundamentalist Christians with their belief in end times and apocalypse (coming to power alongside Reagan Republicans), and in part due to energy policy and foreign policy following the rise of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. 

People can say what they want about ""Jewish conspiracies"" in clearly anti-Semitic terms, but it has nothing to do with that - it has everything to do with how politics is played all over the world and throughout history. Zionism is a political ideology that is race/religion based - just as fascism is inherently race/nation based and communism is inherently class based. Judaism happens to be the religion that Zionism is founded on, but they are not the same thing.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Actually I don't.  I have a lenovo laptop, which just happens to have all intel parts, and it works 100% with debian, including wireless.  With other vendors you can end up in situations where you have to use ndis wrapper or some other bs.  Intel actually supports their hardware on linux, so it is just the way to go there.  I personally have nvidia in both my desktop and my laptop, but on the laptop I regret it (even though it is blazing fast) because it breaks suspend for some reason (nv driver works, but the nv driver is dog slow even with 2d, and my laptop has 1920x1200 resolution, so you can see the page redraw when you switch desktops).  

Finally I recommend the SSD based on Linus Torvalds glowing review.  I did some searching around for a cheaper equivilent, and I found out that for some unknown reason the SSD's from other vendors have write latency issues, and that lots of writes can cause the drive to block for up to 15 seconds!  They couldn't even get vista to install on one (although linux was fine except for the 15s freezing that happens on high write load).  Meanwhile the intel SSD supposedly just works.  

2 years ago I would have said get an X2 or something, but AMD is just behind now.  Also, the AMD chipsets have poorer driver support on linux, especially the Nvidia ones.

In the last few years I was a sysadmin for a large government organization, and I had to get linux up and running on dozens and dozens of different kinds of hardware, from sparc's to every model of Dell, to Apple.  My weird Intel preference comes from that.  Dell's are good computers, but when the random wireless chipset doesn't have a linux driver you are SOL.  This is getting better, but why go through the pain of NDIS wrapper when you can just apt-get install the intel firmware and it works from then on.  I've never had any intel based computer that linux (redhat, debian) didn't just work on (I mean intel throughout, like some cheaper dells, or lenovo with 'centrino' (centrino just means they used all the intel chips instead of mixing with other vendors).  However, video hardware can still give you issues.  The linux invidia driver is usually an iteration behind the windows driver.  The ati driver was terrible, I don't know if it has improved recently or not.  Meanwhile intel just works and is ok, plus it has good power characteristics.  For desktops this is not a big deal, and I disabled any sort of power saving other than cpu throttling, so the driver is stable there.  I do 90% of my work on my laptop and I would have really liked suspend to work, maybe someday.","1225547174"
"politics","t5_2cneq","Regardless of homos the laws on cohabitation should be firmed up and this should make it possible for *any* parties capable of unimpaired judgment to draw up a binding contract for cohabitation, and for it to be recognized with certain rights and responsibilities mostly equivalent to married couples. 

But gay marriage? Come on. So what about sheep being gay? I don't understand this logic - Homosexuality is a mental defect, not a choice or an 'alternative state'. Just because there's a critical mass of such defected people doesn't make it necessarily the right thing to do. 

If I'm - hypothetically speaking of course - a socially fully functional, military-trained psychopath who has over the last nearly two decades served a useful life doing what he loves in service of various agencies but is getting a little antsy these days due to the lack of any action, and I'd like say a scheme where people like me pay a certain amount extra in tax, then one prisoner could be released every quarter by lottery from a state with the death penalty for me to hunt down in a large enclosure, and if there were enough of us to make that proposal a viability does that make it right? I mean, the prisoner's gonna die anyway right? And in the course of this you're catering without prejudice to the specific defect of a mentally defected yet socially functional individual who pays his taxes and does everything a citizen should. 

Homosexuality is also not a mental defect that impedes general function in society but by this action, you might as well be lobbying for the right for high-function Aspergers to have others officially recognize that they can be insensitive dicks, or for Tourettes sufferers to have codified into law the ability for them to say 'Fuck Cunt Shit etc' in public places. 

Save us from the more loudmouthed, over-entitled, bitchy-but-can't-take-it-in-return,  holier-than-thou Apple-wielding homos.

Jesus, the fact that you can actually spout a line like this without understanding that this sentiment of reason is a direct result of enlightenment philosophers like Immanuel Kant just shows how little background you have done.

*Also, I'd add that science is truly a perfect mechanism for finding truth, based on a minimal number of assumptions and a systematic method for proving assertions. If science cannot give you the answer, chances are your question has no answer (probably because you wrongly assumed something to be true, which makes your question irrelevant).*

This is total bullshit. Science isn't some magic mechanism for finding 'truth.' Science comes up with theories that can be tested. For something to be able to be tested, it has to have conditions under which it can be proven false. Many things can not be proven true or false in any empirical sense, including many things like quantum string theory for example. Science is not a perfect instrument, it has limitations, which are features and not problems. It's limitations are why we can call certain things scientific, and recognize others as not being empirically testable.

We were in a relatively safe area, i.e. no real threats in this city (although it had definitely seen its share from the looks of things). I was out drinking with a friend, and some NATO guys from a different country invited us to go to a whorehouse with them. We got there, and it was in the basement of an older apartment building. Down the stairs, down a hallway of mirrors, to the door we went. The doorman had the biggest hands I had ever seen! We paid our $5 American to get in, and had a beer. The place was more like a strip joint than the whorehouses I had seen in Latin America. We sat at a table drinking our beers for a moment, then realized these dudes brought us to a bad place; some of the girls dancing (and being sold [or rented, w/e]) were only like 9 or 10 years old. I hoped my friend wasn't into it, because I wouldn't have known what to do in that situation, and I was relieved that he looked at me in the same way. One of us said ""we need to get the fuck out of here!"" or something like that, and we bounced. We kind of remembered seeing other Americans in there (nobody we knew), and servicemen from other allied countries, and when we got back to command, we reported it. Truthfully, I don't think anything ever happened either, no investigation or anything. I don't really know. I'm not sure I can verbalize how that changed my life, but it certainly did. ","1225548031"

From the article, it says Chrysler is done for, all right, no escaping there, but the scary thing is that GM needs its cash account, otherwise GM might fail, too.

If GM and Chrysler fail, al the parts factories and so on can result up to 2 million jobs lost, and the entire economy of Detroit in ruins. Combined, they employ more than 200,000 workers, and there wouldn't be anyone to take over their workforce and factories, because the current world economy doesn't need them.

I'm sure it's a worst-case doomsday scenario, written to scare the people (as the tone of the entire article was), but nevertheless, if the estimation is even half correct, or 10% correct, the effect would be devastating to the entire world and not just the U.S.

The idealistic side of me says we should let them fail for not reading the market correctly and blowing all the chances they had, but the utilitarian in me thinks that all the suffering that would be caused to the workers there should be prevented, if it could be.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It's improved a fair amount I would say. You can actually hit the banshees now (jumpers/fasties), the shamblers and players have new skin models/textures, as do the rifle,sledgehammer,pistol,menu system.

My favorite thing is that now, at the start of a map if you connect 20-30 seconds late you get spawned anyways so you don't have to wait 10 minutes to play. 

And you have moltovs and revolvers now, albeit most maps haven't incorporated them yet.

Additionally the ZM's window has been overhauled and to reduce spamming the zombie spawns now run  on a queue so unless I want to wait for the zombies to finish being made, I can only spam 10 zombies at a time. This in all 2-3 hours I've played so far has balanced the game tremendously. You can still spam, but it requires more patience. 

Edit: To answer your 2nd question, personally I find drifters (the floating ones) to be the best zombie, they gobble up ammo and they are avoided like the plaque because of their ranged attack. Most skilled players can run through spam of hulks or shamblers (normals) but almost no one would be able to get past drifter spam without taking major damage.","1225549083"

Very good pizza.  You can go there and sit down, although it can be very busy during the summer, and you have to wait in line outside the restaurant since it is rather small.  You can also order delivery via Dining In.  It's best not to order extra cheese or pizzas with lots of chunky toppings when ordering delivery.  I recommend the Margherita.

You could have a field day studying this. There are so many factors that go into whether something gets upvoted. It involves a bit of randomness because redditors vary in intelligence. So, if you post a subtle comment, either someone smart comes along, and upmods it, or someone stupid comes along, misses the point, and downmods it. Once it has been downmodded or upmodded, it is a whole new ball game, because now group instinct kicks in and people will be more inclined to follow the original modder's example, however lots of smarter redditors also have anti-group instinct, and when they see something downmodded, they make sure to read it, and will upmod it if it has any redeeming value, even if they wouldn't have upmdded it if it hadn't been downmodded. These 2 instincts can tie at first, but if something gets several downmods, then the group instinct gets stronger and you are pretty much a lost cause. 

However, there are tactics to counter this by the original poster. If you go *Edit: [insert condescending remark to downmodders]*, then lots of people following group instinct will snap out of it, and will upmod your post, or else maybe it catches the attention of other non-group instinct redditors who will feel sympathy to your plight and upmod you. I'm not sure which one of those 2 it is. Anyways, this can backfire if people percieve you as being whiny (for the dumb redditors, impression of a post is often worth more then content). 

You can also be salvaged if someone posts a response to your post, and you reply with a very likeable post. Then people will see your likeable post and go back and upmod your other post. However, lots of redditors will go around and downmod any posts of yours they see without a real reason, they just didn't like your first post. Hence why ""I thank you for your thoughts"" got downmodded. Anyways, another topic completely is whaat causes the less intellegent redditors to originally upmod or downmod post. More intellegent ones will upmod on content, but I have no clue what's going on in the minds of some people when they upmod or downmod. It has a lot to do with, as alecducak said, the timing, the place your comment shows up in relation to other comments and how many points those other comments have, ect.","1225549605"

I find the humour to be rewarding, oftentimes being the result of strong character development and knowledge of the situation presented in the Arlen Universe. The show hooks you where regular cartoon sitcoms use catchphrases and one-dimensional characters to generate gags. The universe is so deep that you laugh at the people and not just the zany things they say.

Names like: Lane Pratley, Octavio, Reverend Strupp and Counselman Fred Everett among many. These people don't have one liners that define who they are, they have a back story, they have chemistry with other people in the town, and as a result when they are introduced in a story you have that much more working behind them to generate a plot.


I'm going to miss it. But in honesty a show like that had a surprisingly (14 years? holy christ) long run for a show that cerebral.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","You make some excellent points and I would largely agree.  However I will hypothesize there's one aspect of modern economies that you've neglected.  Credit.

Money, while not real value by any definition, is our yard stick of value.  What you'll pay for something is what it's worth.  Credit has skewed all that.  If I'm at the store with $10 in my pocket and see the boxed DVD collection of the Beverly Hillbillies on sale for $75, I'm SOL (unless I try to invoke the archaic concept of lay-away - which would re-validate your theory).  But if I have that same $10 and a credit card with a $10,000 limit, then I'm not thinking opportunity trade-offs (opportunity costs in relation to a finite lifetime) anymore.  I just want to see exploits of Jed and Granny and the gang. 

My purcahse then validates the price (which wouldn't happen if I only had the $10) and they keep selling the set for $75...

The problem with most economic theory is that it's based on rationality.  Human beings are anything BUT rational.  ""Shit, I'll pay my Visa bill eventually...""  Maybe you will.  Maybe you won't.

Same thing applies to cars, houses and whatever else I can promise to pay for with someone elses money...

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; ... you wouldn't want to put your rubbish out on the wrong day unless you want the urban wildlife spreading it all over the front of your house, so it sorts itself out..

You must not live in the shitty part of town. ;) This is exactly the problem, and the reason that there are fines for putting rubbish out on the wrong day. It must be pretty frustrating if you can only afford to live in Slumville but you want to make the best of things you can &amp; keep your house &amp; garden tidy... only to have the neighbours put their bins out whenever they like and have trash all over the place. This does indeed happen on many estates - in my street the collection is a Tuesday and many people put their bags out at the weekend, but here they are rarely torn open and it is rarely a problem (perhaps because it is only a day or two early, or maybe there are not many foxes or cats around here).

The other reason people have been bitching recently over councils' use of surveillance cameras &amp; this law is dog fouling. My response to this is *""WTF? so you think it's OK to let your dog shit on the pavement?""* If you don't like a law forbidding your activities  then protest against it &amp; get it changed, but if we agree that laws (bylaws?)  covering dog-fouling &amp; littering are valid &amp; just then surely the council should be enforcing them?

To me, **what this really highlights is not ""council misuse"" of surveillance, it shows why surveillance is so bad in the first place**. I don't believe that this is an ""anti-terror law"" being abused - it is merely enforcement officials using the law as it is worded. If one accepts it's OK to use surveillance to crack down on the spectre of terrorists it's going naturally to become used for things like this... but oh, no, I'm sure a couple of years ago the Daily Mail were up in arms over ""why doesn't the government do something about the terrorists"" and applauding these laws as they were passed.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","Let me illustrate the situation with actual numbers. A village of 1000 people decides to have a stable population: a fixed number of beds, a fixed number of kitchen chairs, a fixed number of cars, etc. The village has room for exactly 1000 persons and needs no new facilities, it only replaces what wears out. The main factors to consider are the average lifespan of the population and the average age when women give birth. The average number of coexisting generations is the lifespan divided by the birthing age. There are all kinds of workable scenario for this and here are a few.


Lifespan: 40, birthing age: 15

375 villagers are aged 0 to 15, 625 villagers are aged 15 to 40. A new generation replaces an old one every 15 years (from 375 new parents) and 2.8 generations coexist.


Lifespan: 40, birthing age: 20

500 villagers are aged 0 to 20, 500 villagers are aged 21 to 40. A new generation replaces an old one every 20 years (from 500 new parents) and 2 generations coexist.


Lifespan: 80, birthing age: 20

250 villagers are aged 0 to 20, 750 villagers are aged 21 to 80. A new generation replaces an old one every 20 years (from 250 new parents) and 4 generations coexist.


Lifespan: 80, birthing age: 26

325 villagers are aged 0 to 26, 675 villagers are aged 27 to 80. A new generation replaces an old one every 26 years (from 325 new parents) and 3 generations coexist.


The village can maintain a stable population regardless of lifespan, regardless of the age when women give birth, regardless of the number of coexisting generations. None of these factors are an obstacle to a stable population. The trick is in the fine-tuning of incentive for parents to have a sustainable number of children.

Nearly every human society throughout history has distinguished between male and female gender by the style, color, or type of clothing they wear and has had a set of norms, views, guidelines, or even laws defining what type of clothing is appropriate for each gender. Cross-dressing is a behavior which runs significantly counter to those norms and therefore can be seen as a type of transgender behavior. It does not, however, necessarily indicate transgender identity; a person who cross-dresses does not always identify as having a gender different from that assigned at birth.","1225551647"

That's where you're wrong. The exploration of totalitarian authoritarianism in 1984 seeks to illustrate how it's NOT primarily about some elite, because the elite are just one player in a general societal cluster-fuck, and a cluster-fuck that is largely without a 'heart' or 'head' so to speak - as Big Brother does not really exist, and niether does Emmaneul Goldstein, and we've *always been at war* with whoever.

Also, to put 2 million into perspective, when you hear the unemployment of USA went up 1% that's 3 million people.  Right now our unemployment is at 4% I believe, so fully 12 million people do not have jobs.

So even their ""doomsday"" scenario isn't that bad.  What I'm trying to get at is propping up zombie jobs so that we don't have more unemployed people is a horrible horrible thing to do.  That's what Japan did for their ""lost decade"".  Look how well that worked out for them.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Well, they try to create a model that's going to represent the makeup of likely voters. A simple random sample will not all be likely voters or even registered voters, so they first have to narrow it to registered voters, then again to ""likey"" voters, based usually upon past voting history (which means that first time voters tend not to get counted as ""likely"").

They then try to weigh the samples to reflect actual proportions of party registrations. For instance, if a state has 60% Republicans and 20% Dems, they will weight the samples accordingly to reflect the likely outcome of that state. If they use equal numbers of Pubs and Dems in Utah, they're not going to get an accurate result.

That's where Zogby is flawed. He's weighing his party affiliations to reflect past trends rather than current. Right now, the Dems have a significant advantage in registered members, but Zogby is acting like the numbers are about equal.

Looking more closely at this one day sample, I see that it was only about 400 people anyway. That's a very small sample with a huge MOE(you need upwards of 1000 before you start to shrink the MOE).

It's a one day aberration with a volitile sample size, and a dubiously weighted methodology. It's also not supported by corresponding movement in any of the other polls. It's nothing to get alarmed about. The polls on balance and in toto have shown an unusually stable race, especially at the electoral level.","1225552228"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Thanks for you reply gibs. Given your comments about John Howard I'm going to assume a level of familiarity with recent Australian political history. I could be wrong on certain matters and am happy to be corrected too.

&gt; asylum seekers are more or less by definition at the border requesting asylum.

No. You can be threatened anywhere in the world and request asylum, shelter from this threat, from anyone at anytime. 

Recall, indeed, Philip Ruddock slurring those who would travel by boat to seek asylum on australia's shores, suggesting, rather, that they join the que at embassies in remote countries. ""Que jumpers"" was the slur. Ruddock preferred that asylum was sought away from the borders.

However, I see your distinction now. I'll augment it a little: Yes, having a country rescue anybody (citizen or non-citizen) in another country is different from a country accepting someone into their protection (via border crossing or embassy).

&gt; Don't get me wrong, it would be great to be able to do this, but it doesn't sound like a realistic responsibility that a country could/should take.

The main obstacle is sovereignty. If we desire a world in which there are sovereign states, then this requires every country pull their claws in.

The principle of sovereignty has been at the heart of the UN since it's inception. However, so has individual rights listed in ""The universal declaration of human rights"". Preserving sovereignty and human rights are sometimes at odds.

When they are at odds, I'd suggest, sovereignty should give way.

To make sovereignty properly yield to human rights we ought democratize the UN security council and give it a military more powerful than the united states. A UN military and a police force.

Such a police force could respond to anybody who is feeling threatened. Just as a domestic police force now respond in a domestic context (well there could be improvements here too). 

We ought, thirdly (depending on how you are counting), have globally open borders. No passports.

These things are necessary to solve not only the problem of people suffering from becoming political refugees but from becoming economic refugees.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Japan is behind on the use of good effective medicines...I can't even buy ibuprophen in a drug store.

That's truly strange, I am not as familiar with Japan as I am with Korea, but in Korea you can buy pretty much any drug out there at a pharmacy without prescriptions--indeed, many times for less thretaning illness one only sees a pharmacist and doesn't even bother with a doctor.

I'm attending college in the States now, and I always bring a few medicines that have been banned here for one reason or another or is extremely hard to obtain, but works wonders for me and can be picked up by any child in Korea.

&gt;I went to a dermatologist 3 different times for 3 different things, and the guy gave me the exact same stuff every time. They use lice powder to treat scabies... yeah...totally NOT effective treatment for that problem.

Well, this could be a cultural problem.  Just like your example with the clubbed feet, Japanese culture may not consider skin problems or clubbed feet to be serious enough to merit hardcore intervention--if you've ever noticed, not a lot of people get braces in Japan either (like the Brits) since it's not a life-threatening problem.

I did, however, notice that Korea also has a weird thing with skin disorders.  I remember when I was a kid my skin used to peel spontaneously off of my hands, and every doctor I went to insisted it was an allergic reaction and they all wanted to prescribe me drugs for it.  I have seasonal and food allergies to a bunch of stuff, and I know what an allergy feels like.

&gt;And the rudeness of some (well maybe all of the old school) doctors. . . . because they can get away with being shitty because the people trust them because they have the all hallowed 'Dr."" credit to their name.

Well you could say the same for most societies--doctors in the US used to command similar respect and social status, although with the rise of Wikipedia and WebMD and insurance companies and whatnot, that respect has steadily eroded.  In Asia respect for scholars is still very much culturall ingrained, and even the title for a doctor (醫者), sensei (先生), means ""one who lived before me.""  I mean, if we called our doctors that, our doctors would probably get more respect too.

Actually, doesn't doctor mean teacher in Latin?  So in fact both Chinese and Roman ancient cultures both venerated medical practitioners, and the Westerners just got ruder quicker.

&gt;Another example. An ex co-worker of mine

Like you hear endlessly on reddit: data is not the plural of anecdote.  Also, even if there was a systemic problem in the Japanese healthcare system where doctors are routinely causing infection in their patients,  this is endemic in US hosiptals as well.

&gt;So no, the people of Japan live long DESPITE their doctors, not because of them.

You certainly present a compelling case, and you might be right.  I still think you're viewing it from a Western-centric viewpoint, and are ignoring a lot of other issues, e.g., pharmacists and [TCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_medicine).

A Polish priest recently was awarded the Templeton Price for his contributions to cosmology.

http://www.culturekiosque.com/nouveau/news/michael_heller155.html

Since St. Thomas's Summa Teologica the Church has had their eye in the skies.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica


It is said that one catholic priest gave us the Big Bang, the Vatican could not accept the idea of a young Einstein saying that the universe is static, if it were true then there would have never been a moment of creation of the universe.

They had a man to counter dict that with solid theoretical background, father George Lamaître:

http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/science/sc0022.html

Together with Friedmann and Edwin Hubble they would make Einstein correct his theory and later affirm that the universe is in constant expansion. (at each moment further from a point of origin)

To the Vatican it was of crucial importance to have a strong case for the Big Bang as it would somehow prove that there was a moment in which everything in this known universe came to be.

http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Venus_Express/SEM9C3808BE_0.html

Notice three things.  First, Venus spins backwards and its day is 243 Earth days long.  That creates extended periods of direct sunlight which amplifies the greenhouse effect.  Two, the pressure at the surface of Venus is 90 bar compared to our one bar.  Venus is a bit smaller too and this all works out to about 100X more atmosphere on Venus than Earth.  Third, the Venusian atmosphere is 96% CO2 while Earth's is about 0.04% (wikipedia for Carbon Dioxide).  96/.04 = 2400.  And there's 100 times more atmosphere to begin with.  That means Venus has about 240,000 times as much CO2 from a pure mass standpoint.  

So, as for your analogy of Earth to Venus, you are comparing apples and oranges.  ","1225553213"

And ultimately guns being illegal _does_ work. Most people are too lazy to build a makeshift gun and few people know _real_ criminals to buy one off. So illegalising guns helps stop all the stupid kids carrying them for their gang wars, etc.

I know you Internet Tough Guys might like to think you could hold off a gang of robbers if you had a gun - but who wants to carry a gun around with them everywhere just to be safe. That'd be like a warzone or something.

From what I understand they applied for the wrong visa (I can't remember what the name of the visa is). Basically it has a rule which requires your entire family to be fit and healthy so as not to impose a burden on the health care system.

From the interview on the radio the immigration spokesperson basically said the applicant was given bad advice.

I wouldn't understand for the life of me why a man with a medical degree working in the outback is not given a permanent residency visa if not even citizenship. In the end he just applied for the wrong Visa and from what I understand it should hopefully soon be rectified.

The problem is they insisted on saying that they can take care of the boy and he wouldn't be a burden on the healthcare system. However there is no clause in any visa that makes the recipient of it exempt from health care, if you're living in Australia you are entitled to health care.

And he went with what his advisors told him to do on the bailout.  There's a ton of wasteful spending in there, but it's still too early to tell if that money makes any difference in how quickly we are able to eventually pull out of this crunch.


Even so, those are 3 things.  You forget that McCain voted for those same three things - plus the original Patriot Act.

But the fact remains, in the big picture, they are only 3 issues in a huge pool of the thousands of things that must be decided in the next 4 or 8 years.  Voting against Obama because those three positions is the same as somebody voting against him because of his stance on abortion.

Many otherwise decent people who think of themselves as patriotic are unaware of the socialist origins of the Pledge.  I knew about Bellamy from my days as a Boy Scout but as you would suspect, we did not get into his political leanings.

I find the pledge objectionable on its face because the term, ""allegiance,"" derives from 'liege' which implies a recognition of a fundamentally feudal relationship, in this case, with the Republic simply taking the place of the Sovereign.  Also, at the time the Constitution was written, the nation was quite clearly ""Divisible"" not ""Indivisible.""

The Pledge of Allegiance is a piece of statist propaganda which they make school children repeat over and over.  I even remember a version we were required to use in french class over 20 years ago... Je jure fidelite, au drapau des estat unis de la 'merique, et a la republique, qui symboliza, un nacion, su deu, indivicible, avec liberte et justice pour tout.

It's just two Corporate parties, pandering to their roots with the buzzwords that mobilize them. There is no real difference.

Both are taking huge contributions from the large financials (who actually run our country by the way, do your research), both support the PATRIOT act, further erosion of rights, telecom immunity, and Joe Biden even thinks it should be a FELONY to run 'unauthorized code' on computers.

No and no... your way off base.  Obama takes contributions from companies like Google and Microsoft, McCain takes it from Exxon and Haliburton.  MOST of Obama's money comes from private donations of $25+ from millions of individual citizens, like me.

No matter what you say about Joe Biden he's a million times smarter than Sara Palin.  I don't want a mix of church in my state.

It's not about being perfect, it's about leadership.  Obama has it.

The legistlature is going to pass the laws, not Obama, the judiciary is going to determine if they are constitutional, not Obama, what Obama is going to do is control the executive branch which is like the CEO of a large company.  He's going to delegate and take charge of the military.  Get us out of Iraq.  Get the country mobilized to start an Apollo like project to get on to alternative energy and realize energy independence.  He's going to bring more wealth to the middle class by lowering taxes on 99% of Americans.  Bring jobs back home to America from overseas by getting rid of the tax cuts for corporations who offshore their jobs.  And giving those tax breaks to companies that give jobs to US citizens.  With a strong middle class America will be able to PRODUCE things again not just be a debt nation.

The man is smart, driven, focused, well liked by the rest of the world, a good public speaker, able to reach accross the isle to get things done.  Has republican and democratic allies and endorsements.  These are all things that are important to rebuilding America after the disaster that was Bush Inc.

I stair at a blank wall and I see that it is not still. It shimmers. Not because I'm high I assure you. It's because there is not enough light in this room so my brain has to turn up the gain to make the details of the wall bright enough for my conscientiousness to see inducing noise into the image I see. If you have played with a good camera you will notice the same effect between pictures taken with lots of light and pictures taken with little or no light. Watch TV, you can tell how dark the room is basically by how much noise is in the picture.

Natural things need a good explanation. There is  too much order and complexity in the world for you to make sense of it without an explanation; You could not convince others yet alone yourself to any great deal of depth that there is no God working behind the scenes to make everything work before the idea of evolution came about. 

Before Darwin an atheist could say to himself that there is no proof for the existence of god but he would have to beat himself over the head to look at the plants and the animals with their exquisite parts beyond the manufacture of man and not see the handy work of something greater then himself; Before Darwin there were no good intelligent atheists in western culture, only stubborn intelligent ones.

Evolution explained how simple rules could produce complicated creatures; Replication with variation, heredity and a process of selection was powerful enough to explain every observation that was and has been made about the natural world to this date.   

All of the sudden the lack of a proof for the existence of the gods made sense; You do not need God to explain life anymore. All you need is the differential success of imperfect self replicators and enough time, which we have more then enough evidence for.

Evolution does not disprove the existence of God: The pope is correct. What evolution takes away is the last great hope people had at coming up with a convincing argument for that crazy incompetent father figure who is supposed to be running everything and making sure that however fucked up things look there is a good reason behind it all and all we have to do is follow these ten simple rules that the big important man with the big hat and fabulous robes gives us.

Any item you buy at a store that is sold by volume, weight, length, or area will have metric units on them.  This is standardized by law.  If you take some time to look at the labels it is listed in the same size as the american system measurements.  Generally the more even measurement is listed first.  For example a 2 liter bottle of pop will list ""2LITERS(2.1 QT)"" and a 20 ounce bottle of pop will list ""20 FL OZ (1.25 PT) 591 mL.  This puts equal emphasis on both of our systems of measurement.

&gt;""Adopted as one of"" != standardized.

There are two definitions of the word standard that are applicable in this case.  They are ""something established by authority, custom, or general consent as a model or example"" and ""something set up and established by authority as a rule for the measure of quantity, weight, extent, value, or quality""(from Merriam-Webster).  By the second definition I listed we became standardized in the 1860's.  By the first definition we still fit the requirement.  The metric system is taught in schools, required on labeling, and widely used in real life.

Prices for everything have been set by the amount of $ people have access to (wages, investments, credit).

Lots of that money has evaporated.  That means prices MUST fall.  When they fall, producers get the signal that they should cut back production. People get fired. They spend less. The economy evaporates simply because the number of $ has disapeared.  Its like randomly taking 50% of the money away in a Monopoly game.

So . . . some how, some way, they have to get this money into the hands of people who will circulate it or its an ugly assed year or five ahead.

The folks they are giving it to now are NOT circulating it at all well.

Your definition of fascism isn't entirely wrong, because that's certainly an aspect of it, but it takes a lot more than that to make fascism. (Otherwise, Japan and China would both be fascist states.) You also need rampant nationalism, generally wedded to ideas of expansion and return to the virtues of an idealised past, loss of individual rights, a police state, conservative social views, a certain kind of political aesthetics (think nazi-style parades and so on), and lots more.

None of this is to defend ""socialism of the rich"" (which is a political oxymoron if ever there was one). It's just that trying to pretend that that's the same as fascism is just a way to demonstrate profound political ignorance.

And that's something I find Americans have too much of, otherwise people wouldn't be able to make idiotic claims like ""Obama is a socialist"" (and to make people think that this would be a horrible thing).","1225555536"

I'm a virgin, and her first experience with sex was not all that great, so we offered to each other to have sex just so she could have a better experience, and my first time didn't suck.

I brought the topic up a little while after that discussion, and she seemed kind of uncomfortable about it, but I think it's because she's always been slightly uncomfortable about this sort of topic. I still felt like a douche, and I still haven't been able to apologize to her for acting so rudely.

Sorry to say that statement is worthy of ""blowback"", -it does set up a straw man; nobody blames ""deregulation"" for everything. 
I would go so far as to say the trend is to not put enough blame on ""deregulation"" for creating our present woes, especially on the lines of non-enforcement of anti-trust law, renegade accounting practices (both government and private books), lack of laws ensuring transparency (again both gov. and private), etc.","1225555921"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Look, no competent military - and the Russian military is certainly such - starts an action with hundreds of tanks without a **lot** of preparation. This isn't the movies or video games, this is real life, where all those tanks need (1) to not be ambushed, (2) be supplied, and (3) have clear plans of where to go (and yes, I was in the military myself).

Having combat-ready troops near the border is just **one** thing. You also need concrete plans to deploy them. 3 hours is essentially instantaneous - it takes longer than that just to (1) validate your intel about a Georgian action being started, and (2) make necessary preparations and coordinations for the response.

It is clear from the speed of the Russian response that they were well-prepared for exactly what the Georgians did. That implies that they had some foreknowledge of it. Perhaps they have useful spies in Georgia, or well-placed signal intelligence, or perhaps they just had a correct analysis of recent events. We may never know. But this wasn't spontaneous.

1. Big-O behavior on common inputs for your problem domain.
2. Constant factors, particularly ones that involve moving from one level of the memory hierarchy to another.

Some examples of how this plays out:

Engineers don't care that QuickSort is worst-case O(n^2).  They *do* care that it's O(n^2) on presorted input, which is a common use-case.  When that pathological case is broken (eg. by median-of-3 partitioning) they don't care that the worst case is *still* O(n^2).  The smaller constant factors and better space efficiency usually make it preferable over mergesort or heapsort, unless a stable sort is needed.

When I did an autocompletion widget for stock tickers, the first tool I reached for was a string trie, because it's O(k) (where k &lt;= 8 = number of letters in the ticker) instead of O(n) for linear scan or O(lg N) for binary search.  However, when I benchmarked it, binary search over a sorted array won by an order of magnitude.  Why?  Cache effects - a string trie takes vastly more memory, so it couldn't fit in L2 cache, while the array could.

It's common for imperative programmers to reach for a Vector before they use a LinkedList, even if the anticipated workload is heavily insertion-bound.  A vector is O(n) worst-case insert (though O(1) amortized); a linked list is always O(1) for insertion at the head of the list.  But the constant factor for vector iteration is lower than for linked lists (again, because of cache effects), and its amortized O(1) behavior means that insertion is unlikely to be a bottleneck in long-running processes.  (There are some applications where you really do want a linked list though, eg. ones where worst-case latency is critical.)","1225556334"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Precisely my point, the religious system is broken, The T/A-type religion is just less broken than GP religion. My point was that the T/A method involves some degree of reason and peer-review, at least insomuch as they are required to submit to a review of the basis of on interpretation over another. For instance, if I write a systematic theology (a kind of axiomatic-ish interpretation of some doctrine) and publish it, I am subject to a kind of childs version of peer review. Publishing a shitty systematic theology won't ruin me as would publish a shitty scientific paper, but it still doesn't bode well for me in the long run. I guess my point is, at least for now, this is the kind of practice we should encourage overall, as it pushes the entirety of religious doctrine firmly towards a critically examined, non-extremist set of views.

I don't particularly think extremism will ever go away entirely, but what could happen is that the religious establishment- the liberals and moderates, which there are many, many more of, could move towards a more critical position, making it hard to be a fundamentalist, as most people would have been raised with these critical ideas, critical methods, and overall a kind of reverence for something not entirely dissimilar from critical thinking. From that point, I should think it's much harder to become extremist.

In any case, the naive position -- the kicking, screaming, yelling of variations of ""get off my lawn"" -- at the fundies will _certainly_ never work. My basic premise is that if we concentrate on the set of people who are amenable to critical thought and discussion, if we talk to them in a sensible, grown up way, and separate them from the crazy-people populating the pernicious purveyors of poppycock, then at least we have a chance.

I dislike playing games I know I'm going to lose, and I know I'll lose every round with the crazy fundies.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I was actually thinking about this, back in the day when McCain first saw Obama he could've thought. ""This young man could be a fantastic president..."" 

So, he got together with a young Obama and began speaking to him on what he needed to do and what they both needed to do... This was right after Bush being re-elected in 2004 (Mind you, Kerry and McCain worked together years ago on the POW/MIA acts. Chances are, McCain thought he could angle Kerry into office because of his intellectualism, he didn't count on Kerry's rigid lack of charisma...)

So, he found and helped a young man add his name to some good bills. Do some good work in the senate (All under the table of course)

and then, in 2004, helped Obama get the speech that rocketed him into stardom.

They then sat together and said. ""In 2008, we will run against each other."" And McCain made a vow that if he couldn't be president, he would make sure that someone with a resolute heart would be. Someone he could respect, and he realized the only way to do this was to destroy his image, and destroy the image of the GOP/Republicans in such a way that only the fanatical base would stay... 

And thus we arrive at today. They've orchestrated this in a way so McCain picks an idiot VP, one with no foreign policy experience that will excite that small percentage base, and alienate the rest. Obama picks Biden, who is very intelligent. McCain and Obama realize that such a contrast will paint Palin as the anti-intellectual she is; and will excite both the Democratic bases, and exclude moderates from the red states.


This is my dream at least, I really don't like what McCain has become, because if he has always been like this then I was blinded in 2000... Well, here's to hoping that the two men debating, and speaking with each other, and running against each other are men of honor, and sacrifice for the country, and for the people of this once great Union.","1225556482"

Here it is only illegal to for those under 18 to purchase or consume alcohol in public so a lot of kids get their older siblings or even parents to buy them alcohol and they drink it in private.

This results in a completely different attitude towards drinking and a lot more responsibility by the time kids get to 18. Hell, a lot of the people I know including me were responsibly drinking by the age of 16 as it is not uncommon for Aussies to start drinking at 13 as opposed to the American way which is to turn 21 and get pissed all through college with the 'drinking makes you cool' mentality.","1225556817"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I really think Libertarianism has a better reputation than it deserves.  Unless you are a business, you may well end up getting pretty fucked under a Libertarian government, Ron Paul's or otherwise.  Relaxation of economic regulations has put in a pretty bad way.  It might have been fine to support that in the 1970s when the Libertarian Party was formed, but now businesses have far too much invested in the government for there to be a smooth transition between the current state of things and a Ron Paul-esque governmental structure.  Large corportations aren't going to just go away with the swearing in of a new president and free trade will carry the same negative implications that it has for decades.  As for other Libertarian views, such as support of civil liberties, that's all well and good if you are already in a position of relative power, ie. male, white, employed.  There are a large number of people who rely on ""socialist"" programs like Social Security (which any thinking person can see would be completely gutted if it was privatized) and individual charitable actions will hardly negate the cost of living for most of these people.  And let's take another bit of the Libertarian Party platform, ""victimless crimes"".  So, we relax immigration laws, decriminalize prostitution and drug laws and lo and behold, we will once and or all prove there is no such thing as a victimless crime.  But who gives a damn if a bunch of young women get shipped into the US and forced into prostitution?  I don't know, I guess I just have sort of moral compass that points me away from that.  And I also find it mildly disturbing that Ron Paul has any connections, however tenuous, to right wing white supremacy groups.  Libertarianism is a pipe dream.  ","1225556868"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Because Halloween fell on Friday, I expected a busier than usual turnout of trick-or-treaters so I bought 4 of those giant bags of candy. At twilight I looked out and the streets were all but dead. Most of the houses were dark. Up until 9pm I had about 30 kids come by, my giant bowl of candy barely had a dent it. In previous years I've had over 100 kids, easily.

At 9:30 I was about to shut off the lights when the doorbell rang one last time. On my doorstep was a plump little 8 year old boy, trick or treating by himself (his dad was standing back on the street). ""Trick or Treat"" he said, in a soft, defeated voice. He was dressed as Ninja Turtle Michelangelo (Mikey was always my favorite). ""Hi Mikey, where are your other ninja turtle friends?""... ""Their parents wouldn't let them go this year"". I glanced down at his pillowcase (which was also TMNT) and saw that it had a few pathetic handfuls of candy in it. He feebly raised his arms and opened his pillowcase, I could tell he was seriously disappointed this year. I grabbed my huge bowl of candy and said ""ok, hold your bag open wide"" as I slowly poured the entire contents into his pillow, weighing the it down significantly. I saw his eyes light up through his orange ninja bandana. ""WOW thanks!"" he screamed as he skipped back to his dad. I flipped the lights off and locked the door. This was the saddest Halloween I've ever known.","1225556881"
"programming","t5_2fwo","Applying to Google.  Can't get into top workplaces if you don't know your algorithms. ;-)

Honestly, I find I almost never use ""textbook"" algorithms in daily programming.  Probably because they always seem to be implemented as library functions for the taking.  However, there were some basic principles that I use all the time:

1. Every programmer should understand recursion.  Everyone.  It comes up all the time, in everything from traversing directories to threaded comments on the web to parsing XML to highlighting DOM nodes in JavaScript to parsing, typechecking, and compiling computer code.
2.  I found myself using a lot of greedy algorithms when I was doing financial software.  Get to know your priority queues as well.  Those strategies come in handy for a wide variety of optimization problems - being able to prove that a particular greedy strategy is optimal can mean hundreds of thousands in sales.
3. Topological sort is really handy.  This usually comes up in dependency analysis - it's a way of linearizing a graph into a list of prerequisites.  And dependency analysis comes up surprisingly often in ordinary programming.
4. Understand the concept of invariants.  Most algorithms require some invariant to be maintained; if you can find that invariant and then know how to construct an algorithm so that each statement preserves the invariant, you'll be able to apply this to a lot of problems *not* in the textbook.  Helps a lot in large-scale programming as well; a lot of successful OO design is in figuring out class invariants and then designing interfaces so they can never be broken.","1225556887"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I was also in the army in my country. We also had 5 years of war in the 1990's, so I have an idea of what i am talking about.
1) Russia just finished military exercise in that region, not long before the war broke out (IIRC)
2) Russia has to have combat ready troops (at least 2-3 brigades) in the region. 1 tank brigade is 100-ish tanks.
3) Every country in the world has plans for all kinds of military operations, offcourse Russia had plans for this.

Now ... let's see your arguments :

&gt;(1) to not be ambushed

There is only one way into Ossetia from Russia and it wasn't blocked by Georgians, so Russians had no problem in deploying to the front, no ambushes waiting for them, remember -&gt; they went to help Ossetians, not attack them

&gt;(2) be supplied

VERY short supply line. Russian bases are maybe one hour drive from border and if you have combat ready troops, you have suplies ready for them. Simple.

&gt;(3) have clear plans of where to go

Plan was simple, first stop Georgian advance, then go deeper into Georgia and dismantle Georgian army. 



South Ossetia is basically one road with villages and small town at the end. That's it. And there is one way in (from Russia), you don't have to be military genius to send troops there. And don't forget that Russian tactics are basically this -&gt; ""if it's not working, send more soldiers and blow the shit out of everything"", which they tested in Chechnya.","1225557542"

Election Night: Get a front row seat to history
--

I'm writing to report that we're seeing a surge of support in states we didn't expect to be close contests, including Georgia and North Dakota.

But the latest battleground is a major opportunity:

John McCain's home state of Arizona -- where we go on the air today.

Democrats haven't been able to compete in these states in years -- and each could open a new path to victory on Election Day. Make a donation of $5 or more today to expand our efforts in these new battleground states.

As a bonus, any donation you make today means you could be selected for a trip to join Barack in Chicago on Election Night. We'll fly you and a guest in, put you up in a hotel, and make sure you have some of the best seats for our huge public event with tens of thousands of supporters:

Make a donation and you could get a front row seat to history

Volunteers and staff are on the move in these new battleground states, and if we can provide them with the right support, they could put us over the top four days from now.

We can't take anything for granted, and this election is too important to ignore any potential path to victory. We need your help right now.

Please make a donation to help us change the electoral map, and bring a real change to our country:

https://donate.barackobama.com/frontrow

It's a volatile political landscape, and in the final four days we have to take the fight to our opponents everywhere we can.

Thank you,

David

David Plouffe
Campaign Manager
Obama for America

P.S. -- If you cannot make a donation, you can still help get us across the finish line by volunteering to help get out the vote:

One of them left to go hand out flyers to other people but one of them stayed and tried to convince me that Jesus loved me and he doesn't care what I do as long as I love him, apparently (this in response to my argument that I try to be a good person, so if God does happen to exist, wouldn't he reward me for that?). She told me that I was a sinner and could not help myself so I had to cry out for Jesus. She also claimed to once be an atheist but couldn't take the weight of her own sins anymore (I don't know why an atheist would feel weighed down by sins, but whatever).

Is there any good way for me to escape this kind of thing in the future so she doesn't have to waste both of our time. Or, if I'm unable to get her to leave, what are some good, simple arguments for atheism that at the very least will leave her without a comeback?","1225557795"

Their economy picked up and they quickly reached full employment. Over a hundred other Austrian towns got interested in doing the same thing. Then the government got scared of losing control, put a stop to it, and everybody went to 30 percent unemployment again.

The reason the housing bubble was designed was so that the economy would stay good to maintain support for the coming wars. Don't forget Bush planned on invading Iraq long before 9/11

I've only had opportunity to vote in 2 elections. The first one was a paper ballot. The second was an electronic voting machine. The electronic method was faster, intuitively designed, gave me the opportunity to double check my selections (is this your final answer?) and review the ballot when I finished voting (Do you want to cast your ballot?). Plus the people running it were nicer, too. In my experience, electronic voting is just a better way to do things.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It was created to allow qualified minorities to get loans where they were rejected improperly.

I guess you missed this part:

&gt;Predatory Lending
&gt;
&gt;Starting in the 1980's, judicial decisions and federal law had preempted usury laws limiting interest rates. By the late 1990's, predatory lending – exploitative high-cost loans to gullible borrowers – had become a serious problem in lower-income neighborhoods.
&gt;
&gt;In a 2002 study exploring the relationship between the CRA and predatory lending, Kathleen C. Engel and Patricia A. McCoy noted that banks could receive CRA credit by lending or brokering predatory loans in lower-income areas. CRA regulated banks may also inadvertently facilitate predatory lending by financing predatory lenders. They also noted that CRA regulations as it was then administered, failed to penalize banks that engaged in predatory lending. They recommended that the federal agencies use the CRA to sanction behavior that either directly or indirectly increased predatory lending by lowering the CRA rating of any bank that facilitated predatory lending. Other analysts and community groups had also complained about this problem.
&gt;
&gt;The FDIC has tried to address this issue by ""stopping abusive practices through the examination process and supervisory actions; encouraging banks to serve all members and areas of their communities fairly; and providing information and financial education to help consumers make informed choices"". FDIC policy currently states that ""predatory lending can have a negative effect on a bank's CRA performance.""

"technology","t5_2qh16","Touch screens are really intuitive - or they should be, at least. It's a nice way of making an interactive GUI that can take up less space than any other terminal, as you (ideally) eliminate the need for a pointing device and a keyboard. That's not to say it should replace a pointing device/keyboard totally, but it should *complement* them, at least, where it is deemed useful. For example, with checking into flights, the touch screen interface is great; rather than having to navigate with a pointing device and typing with a keyboard, all of the necessary inputs can be handled with a touch screen. With hand held devices, touch screen inputs remove having to waste real-estate on keypads and what not..

I would be really happy to have a touch screen computer, for example - with two 24"" monitors, sometimes it would be nice to be able to just touch different parts of the screen instead of having to move the mouse around. Like if I have iTunes running on one screen and I'm using Photoshop on the other, I would like to be able to keep my cursor in Photoshop and just simply hit the screen to control iTunes.

But...

Deregulation is a phantom that progressives continually use to misconstrue the cause of problems.  All things are subject to the laws of cause and effect.  Interjecting a vague word like ""deregulation"" and repeating it over and over and over again does nothing to reveal where problems actually lie.  Of course, politicians love to use it for exactly this reason.

First, the only way an economic monopoly or cartel can form is when the government grants it the privilege to exist as such.  Otherwise, competition eats into market share as a burgeoning monopoly starts raising prices.  Most of these mis-titled ""anti-trust"" regulations do nothing more than keep competition out and give the appearance of limiting power.  After the Sherman Act was passed, the number of corporations in the US *shrunk* drastically as those with political favor used the regulations to squeeze out competitors.

Further, the government grants bond rating agencies a cartel.  These are supposed to be the ""unbiased"" watchers over the financial industry.  Of course, if they don't play ball and decide to honestly rate a lot of these worthless financial instruments, they lose their privilege.

Also, the sheer volumes of laws make it almost impossible to enter the playing field.  I'm currently in law school and browsing the law library looking at federal regulatory laws is quite a dizzying experience.  Trying to make sense out of any of them and the memos, advisory opinions, relevant case history, etc. makes it seem damn near impossible to run a business without a horde of lawyers at one's back.  

Further, the whole ""deregulation"" argument completely ignores the role of the *completely unregulated* Federal Reserve.  They have secret meetings, only issue vague minutes of what goes on, and have unchecked power to control the value of our money.  Naturally, progressives fall into 2 categories (1) those that don't understand central banking; or (2) those that love it because it pays for all the wonderful nanny-state programs that no one would or could pay for otherwise.  Those that fall into the second category also love blaming the market while dishonestly ignoring all the government intervention into it.","1225558823"

What the Bible says about stoning:

For touching Mount Sinai

    Whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death. Exodus 19:13

For taking ""accursed things""

    Achan ... took of the accursed thing. ... And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. ... So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Joshua 7:1-26

For cursing or blaspheming

    And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him. Leviticus 24:16

For adultery (including urban rape victims who fail to scream loud enough)

    If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city. Deuteronomy 22:23-24

For animals (like an ox that gores a human)

    If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned. Exodus 21:28

For a woman who is not a virgin on her wedding night

    If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her ... and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid: Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate: And the damsel's father shall say ... these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. ... But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die. Deuteronomy 22:13-21

For worshipping other gods

    If there be found among you ... that ... hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them ... Then shalt thou ... tone them with stones, till they die. Deuteronomy 17:2-5

    If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers ... thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die. Deuteronomy 13:5-10

For disobeying parents

    If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother ... Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city ... And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die. Deuteronomy 21:18-21

For witches and wizards

    A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them. Leviticus 20:27

For giving your children to Molech

    Whosoever ... giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. Leviticus 20:2

For breaking the Sabbath

    They found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. ... And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones.... And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses. Numbers 15:32-56

For cursing the king

    Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 1 Kings 21:10

Strictly adhering religious people are more likely to also have gotten the message that the church doesn't exactly appreciate a lot of these things. So the study really reveals that people who strongly hold one irrational belief and regularly receive further indoctrination are less likely to hold other, partly conflicting, irrational beliefs, than those who don't regularly get indoctrinated with a specific belief. Big shocker there.

"science","t5_mouw","The Earth is tilted on a wobbling axis.  The axis makes a complete rotation every 26,000 years.  This means there are two ways to consider a year.  One is the time it takes for the Earth to do 360 degrees of revolution and the other is the amount of time from say winter solstice to winter solstice.  Another neat thing happens astronomically each year.  The Earch revolves around the sun in a plane that is elevated 60 degrees from the plane of the milky way galaxy.  So, twice per year the Earth lies in the plane of the galaxy.  The event lasts for 15 hours because the sun has a volume and it takes time to traverse the plane.  From the standpoint of southern Mexico where Mayans lived, the whole 15 hours of galactic alignment will only occur entirely on the winter solstice once every 26000 years.  In 2011 some of the alignment will happen on the night of the 20th.  In 2013 some will happen in the morning of the 22.  But only on 2012 will the whole alignment occur entirely on the Winter solstice.  

The Mayan religion was based around a sun god (like all religions including Christianity).  They built their calendar around astronomy.  This is not about the end of the world, it's about how the stars look from southern Mexico.  Dec. 21 2012 has no astronomical significance for people in China or Australia.  ","1225559084"

McCain is a flawed but decent human being.  His attacks on Obama have been limited (Socialism, Ayers, Rev Wright is ""off the table"" etc.) and I think he actually squirms at the thought of going negative in those ways because of an inherent decency.

In contrast, W &amp; Rove would have had no qualms in playing Rev Wright videos wall-to-wall to scare the crap out of the gun-rack crowd.

&gt;Following Syrian raids on Israeli settlements

You also don't seem to consider that Egypt had kicked out UN peacekeepers in the Sinai and moved 100,000 troops to the Egypt/Israeli border.   Not to mention the fact that prior to the bombing Nasser blockaded a port, which can be considered an act of war.  Yeah, Israel bombed Egypt first but lets not pretend there was no aggression from the other side leading up to the bombing.  Perhaps you should read up on the ""goddamn war so you know what the fuck you are talking about.""  You could also argue more like a 15 year old, I hear that's effective.

How do the School of Americas and the IDF have anything to do with Israel not having any allies other than the US?  The assertion you made, that the US is Israelis only ally, is ridiculous and patently false.  The US might be their most important ally but that is only because it is the most powerful.

Free market is a non real ideal to strive to. No system gets there completely, but open competition in the market and freedom of choice allows the best ideas to flourish the quickest.  Any other system is going to be dictated by a minority and over time, that will mean that progress is limited to the minds of a select few.  Its one of the big reasons civilizations progress was so slow before the industrial revolution.","1225559651"

To me, this should be much less controversial than abortion. If you want to kill yourself, you should be able to do so legally. It's your life, and it's the one thing you actually have control over.

It's not that the action is inherently virtuous, it's that they're doing it when they have the *choice* not to.

You don't have the option of walling yourself away in a compound, paying nannies to look after your kids, wasting vast amounts of money on useless fripperies and living in a comfortable narcissistic fog thinking you're somehow better then normal people, so you get no credit for it.

Celebrities all too often *do* have this option, so they get praised for not succumbing to the temptation.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Socialism goes back a lot further than 1775.  I know based on high school history that the world started in 1775, but socialists ideas go back much much further.  In fact, market price and free market are a lot newer than socialism.

In the Roman Empire there was the idea of a 'fair price'  That is that you should be able to pay for food and shelter if you worked hard all day and were virtuous (didn't gamble, pay for prostitutes, etc).  It was the job of the Emperor to insure that grains were always low enough in cost to ensure this.  The Romans set up the Denarius as one days work to match this model. The Emperor was given all needed authority to ensure the fair price. If the prices were to high, it was the fault of the Emperor. This is what lead to many popular overthrows during its history and why the people would turn so quickly on a leader. The idea lived after the Roman times and even beyond the Renaissance.

This was socialism, the basic unwritten contract in vast amount of history revolves around the idea that the person in charge is given all the authority to ensure that I will live and I can eat.","1225560420"

"canada","t5_2qh68","Like most articles that talk about economic productivity, this one doesn't really understand the term. Labor productivity refers simply to the ratio of output to hours worked. It has much less to do with personal effort than the amount of capital brought to bear on a task.

For example, the most motivated and skilled shoemaker in the world can't produce more shoes than a semi-skilled factory worker operating machine that pumps out a thousand loafers per hour.

Increasing productivity is tied very closely to investment in capital. China today is a good example. The productivity of Chinese workers is still quite low compared to US factory workers, but it's been increasing at an extraordinary rate. It isn't happening because Chinese factory workers are dramatically more skilled and motivated than they were ten years ago - productivity is increasing because vast amounts of foreign capital has been flooding the country.

In fact, productivity in the US and other western countries has been increasing steadily since 1980, and in particular, as information technology was deployed en masse during the 1990s and 2000s. The real scandal is that the working and middle class have not reaped any of the gains from that increase in productivity. They have accrued almost exclusively to the wealthiest citizens.

Lest you think that we're a special case, keep in mind that Chinese factory workers haven't received much more from their economic boom. Ten years ago China was one of the most egalitarian countries. Now it is one of the most unequal.

What I do agree with is the claim that we have shifted to a debt-driven economy. Had low interest rates and easy lending practices not appeared on the scene in the early 1990s, this reckoning would have come years earlier. It's impossible for consumer spending to increase endlessly if real wages are decreasing.","1225560447"

"programming","t5_2fwo","If what you're doing requires a lot of data being read or written to disk (compiling large applications, etc), I highly recommend investing in a good RAID card and configure a RAID 10 setup.  Note, this is not 0+1 (01) that many motherboards support.  RAID 10 and 01 are similar, but RAID 10 is more efficient and better performing (http://www.storagereview.com/guide2000/ref/hdd/perf/raid/levels/multLevel01.html).  Some people may recommend RAID 5, but RAID 5 requires parity bit calculations.  With RAID 5 you're trading some performance for more space.  With disks so cheap, go for performance with RAID 10.

My personal experience:
I was working on a large C++ application project (600MB+ of code, resulted in 2.5GB of .o files when building debug version).  I had a quad core machine with 4GB of RAM and a single 300GB 10k RPM SATA drive.  It took 95 minutes to build the project from a clean start.  The compile was heavily disk bound with the CPU load never getting past 0.5.

I picked up a 3ware 4-port RAID card (3ware 8500 I think) and 4 200GB 7200RPM SATA drives, and configured them into a RAID 10.  My build time dropped from 95 minutes to 17 minutes and CPU load peaked out.  I was shocked at the difference.","1225560653"

To clarify, I don't think that *all* (or necessarily even most) conservatives favor voter suppression, but my experience has been that conservatives are, on average, more comfortable with the idea.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Sometimes we confuse conspiracy with bureaucracy.

Do you realize how much an early voting program HELPS us Democrats? Early voting offers working people a lot more options they wouldn't otherwise have. Instead of having to find several hours during just one day (Nov. 4th) to vote, they can actually plan out which day to go... another thing is that different precincts have different wait times. Early voting gives you a choice of precinct. 

Sure, they could do with more polling locations and more workers. Most government programs and offices could use more funding and staff. Budget considerations come into play in the real world though. Georgia's budget has been FUBAR'd for years; they can't even afford public defenders for indigents charged with crimes. It's really, really bad.

Still, the Washington Post reported that African-Americans comprise 35% of early voting turnout in Georgia. That's a higher percentage of AAs than their % in the general population so I can't really accept that the long wait times are hurting them disproportionately. 

I would also point out that many, if not most, McCain supporters are working folks too (misguided as they may be). As someone who grew up in Georgia, most white ""working class"" voters are unfortunately very conservative and willing to vote against their own economic interests in the name of whatever irrational hatred they're buying into at the moment. So something that tends to disenfranchise the working class may not always have the political effect in the South as it does in places like the Northeast.

If it's about GOP conspiracy to disenfranchise, consider this: My current state, Florida, has a very Republican state government. However, we have *two weeks* of early voting, during which the polls are open for *12 hours a day including weekends*. You can even call or visit the elections dept website to see what the wait times are at different polling locations.

When Gov. Crist recently decided to have the early voting polls stay open longer, a McCain campaign advisor said ""he just blew the state for McCain."" Meanwhile, the Obama campaign was celebrating the decision. Now tell me again how that means it's evil and hurts Democrats.","1225560786"

That brief, also signed by 250 members of the House and Vice President Cheney, urges the Court to strike down the gun ban—and adopt Silberman’s test. Obama wouldn’t go that far. Neither would the Bush Administration.""

"":    Obama unveils federal gun bill

    Obama is proposing to make it a felony for a gun owner whose firearm was stolen from his residence which causes harm to another person if that weapon was not securely stored in that home.

    He's proposing restricting gun purchases to one weapon a month and banning the sale of firearms at gun shows except for ""antique"" weapons. Obama is also proposing increasing the licensing fee to obtain a federal firearms""

    In 2001, Obama was one of just nine senators to vote against a bill that toughened penalties for violent crimes committed during gang activity. Obama said the law did not clearly define a gang member and he questioned why lawmakers were targeting Hispanics and blacks for stiffer sentences.

    Two years earlier, after the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado, Obama voted ""present"" on a bill requiring juveniles to be prosecuted as adults for firing a firearm on or near school property.

    Obama also voted against a bill permitting gun owners to claim self-defense when using a gun in their homes if the local community bans the use of handguns. Obama said municipalities should control local gun regulations, not the state.

    ""That law eviscerated anti-handgun ordinances in some communities,"" Obama said. ""The way I feel, Wilmette should not determine Mattoon's firearms ordinances and Mattoon should not determine Wilmette's."" 

Associated Press, Sept. 11, 2004:

    -Voted 'No' on letting people claim a self-defense protection in court for using a gun in their homes despite local weapons bans. (SB2165, 2004)

    -Voted 'Yes' on letting retired police and military police carry concealed weapons. (SB2188, 2004) 

Chicago Tribune, August 20, 2004:

    Last week, Obama won the endorsement of the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police. Union officials cited Obama's longtime support of gun-control measures and his willingness to negotiate compromises on bills backed or opposed by the FOP.

But I also see a disconnect between the book and the model of government from which the book was [inspired](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Orwell.27s_influences) (Stalinism). A disconnect that I can only resolve, by viewing the elite of 1984 as also being heavily indoctrinated to the point of no-longer being strictly self-interested (perhaps pseudo-self-interested though).

Stalin abused his power with a paranoia unmatched in the annals of history. However, so little of it, resulted in what a normal western perspective would consider, his own interests. He was overtaken by a mental illness, and so was much of the apparatus he constructed, which he was able to construct, because people were persuaded (not by him, Stalin, but by thinkers and leaders who actually had good intentions) to believe that Ignorance is Strength (ie, don't let the petty burgeious things, which invariably took the general form of *one's own personal worldview*, distract from a greater historical destiny), as well as, War is Peace (more promulgated by Stalin as [War Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_communism); which incidentally was protracted well beyond 1921 by Stalin, that Wiki page isn't 100% accurate).

edit: 1984 also highlights the inversion of human and object by idealogical indoctrination, making all the members of the society into a mechanism, which significantly reduces (if not altogether eliminates) the degree to which the elite, as well, act out of self-interest.","1225561125"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've used LaTeX during my studies for project reports, but I'm not sure if this is still a good choice. TeX might have been revolutionary in the 1980s, but haven't other text processing systems such as OpenOffice had time to catch up?

I'm asking this because I will write up my diploma project soon. I will list some of my requirements and try to compare LaTeX and OpenOffice. As there will no doubt be mistakes, please offer your correction and suggestions.


**Working with a &gt;100page document with lots of figures and tables:** LaTeX obviously poses no problem here, and thanks to \include{} the report can be divided into multiple files. I've had a bad experience with MS Office 97 (or was it 2000?) when inserting Excel tables into Word documents: It would crash, or saving would be impossible. How does OpenOffice measure up in this regard? It seems to lock up momentarily when including EPS files, does anyone know of other problems?

**Bibliography**: While I really like the simple approach of BibTeX, a lot of editors of scientific journals do not (no longer?) offer the format for easy copypasta. OpenOffice has a ""Bibliography Database"" in the Tools menu, which I can't figure out without RTFM. Or would you suggest an addon such as [Zotero with OO integration](http://www.zotero.org/documentation/openoffice_integration)?

**Exchange of tables, graphs etc. with my supervisors** OpenOffice wins here, as it can read and write MS Office files.

**Figures**: I want to include figures and pictures, preferably in the following formats: JPEG, EPS, SVG. Of course, they should be numbered and referenced by a tag. AFAIK both LaTeX and OpenOffice do this, but the latter requires more mouse clicking.

**Chemistry formula**: I'd like to write
&gt; CH3OH+(3/2)O2-&gt;CO2+2H2O

and have it turned into something nice looking like
&gt; CH₃OH + (3/2)O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O

(basically subscripted element quantities and superscripted charges)

LaTeX has a package for this. For OpenOffice there's [SuperbChemistry](http://mattmccutchen.net/schem/), but this scans through the whole text and replaces all formulas in one go. Then I'd have to check if it got everything right.

* Increase warring in Afghanistan, a quagmire even 600,000+ soviets in a decade couldn't make any headway in
* Threats to invade Pakistan, a not terribly stable nuclear power, to chase figureheads in cave
* Bellicose rhetoric towards Iran
* Increased funding to Israel by 30 billion over the next decade
* Increase the size of the military by 92,000 soldiers at a cost of 108 billion dollars over the next 5 years.

And that is just on the identical foreign policy, even on domestic policy they have serious similarities:

* Voted for the bailout
* Voted for the Patriot Act
* Voted for FISA immunity
* Voted multiple times to continue the Iraq War
* No single payer universal healthcare

At the end of the day, when you narrow it down. You have very scant and frankly insignifcant differences. A puny tax policy difference (A securities speculation tax like the one Nader advocates would be far superior to both), differing opinions on pork spending, and wedge social issue differences which ultimately don't matter because supreme court judges have to be confirmed by what will be a Democratic-run senate (Although as the last two years demonstrated, that sort of senate isn't too different from a Republican-run senate)

Obama and McCain want the same thing - to enrich their corporate masters by interfering around the world. Whether Obama does it with an artful tongue or McCain does it with more visible coercion, it's the same net effect. 

No, govt. health care alone will not bankrupt the country - it's the continued prof ligation of unsustainable monetary and fiscal policy. Obama has said that he will raise taxes on the rich and lower our spending in Iraq - while promising the moon and stars to more than make up for these cuts. Furthermore, the Treasury is taking on massive government debt through the bailout, and the Congress is allowing the Federal Reserve to overextend ourselves. Our currency is going to be wiped out. Rome is burning, and Congress fiddles. 

Lastly, the bailout violates  Amendment 10 - Powers of the States and People. Ratified 12/15/1791. 

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.


Most of Obama's legislative agenda violates this amendment. Constitutional scholar - my ass!

Again, McCain is blatantly unConstitutional as well, and as reprehensible as Lord Obama. 

Also, I find your rationalizing equivocation for Obama's pathetic voting for unconstitutional and civil liberty undermining legislation really dis-heartening. It shows that you are going to give the Messiah a pass when he becomes president, and continues to aid the plutocracy in raping us.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","There is a difference between situations in which individuals practice western christianity or islam.

Namely, western religions have had +400 years to gradually become adapted to persisting in a liberal states.  There is always a fringe of deity-theory adherents that will state that their holy text is infallible, and should be followed line by line.  In practice, the majority practice a selective observation or aphasia of the tenets, or a wholesale generalization deemed culturally acceptable.  So long as the core idea of a supernatural ego-fulfilling father figure is intact and publicly affirmed, the belief is usually considered socially adequate.

In non-liberal societies, whether theocracies, or military states, monarchies, or unrestricted democracies, it is more common for cultural practices, religious or otherwise, to persist without the need for compromise with emerging social demands, technological discoveries, or reality.","1225562084"

I just have a hard time believing, seeing what we've accomplished technologically and socially, that anyone in the world should go without drinking water or adequate food in 2008.  No children should be drafted into violent Christian armies led by maniacs.

People blame animist and, in many cases, theocratic Muslim beliefs for a lot of these problems, but I have to wonder how much religious fanaticism (of any sort) in these countries is a symptom of poverty, something which has rushed in to deal with the hopelessness and misery of life in these impoverished countries.

The BBC World Service provides overnight radio for many public broadcasting (listener-supported) stations in the United States, and, I'm sure, most other parts of the world.  When driving around at night I hear of these interesting innovations, from harvesting methane from the bottom of lake beds to make energy, to high-tech irrigation innovations in the Third World (Mainstream US media couldn't be less interested).

You know, when I sit down to do heavy work - and I know I'm not alone - I have to clean my desk first.  I have to clean up the whole room, as a matter of fact.  Everything must be in its place.  

I sometimes feel like we as a species ought to do the same; that only after everyone has food, clothing, and shelter (and the capitalists, and the socialists, and everyone else has something to contribute in this regard), and our resources are sustainable and replenishable...only then when we clean up the human condition, can we take the gigantic leap forward that I still think is possible, into space, and so forth.","1225562470"

Where this can be scary in terms the cooling effects due to the lack of sunspots, this is nothing that our solar system hasn't dealt with before. During the the late 1600s and early 1700s the sun went through a 50 year period of no sunspots, and in turn we experienced a mini ice age here on earth.

I can only be consoled by the fact that during a time where (man made, so they say) global warming poses such and ""end time scenario"" type of threat, the sun helping to cool things here for us can help combat that particular issue we seem to be facing. 

I may be stretching out on the limb of the physicists theory of a unified field here, but could it be possible that sun is helping to correct the errors that have caused the warming in the first place. In theory, it certainly makes sense to me. It would be interesting to see a scientific argument concerning this matter.

You can't rationally teach anybody not to bother on about ego-fulfilling deities.  It's not a product of rational faculties, but of affective faculties.  All you can really do is teach people to think, to be both curious about the world and introspective from a young age.

In fact, if I recall accurately, people become more credulous as they get older rather than the reverse.  Children are naturally suspicious of many things, especially authority.  They become cemented as believers when they start to desire things like social status starting as teens, better jobs, better possessions, partners, spouses and children.

Right now we are experiencing massive credit deflation from the unwinding of financial instruments that created credit in really deceptive ways.  For the most part that credit was not part of the money supply that circulates and sets market prices.

However, a lot of the new credit they are creating is directed into the money supply.  Right now that new money and a lot more is being sucked up by this unwinding bad credit.  At some point that will bottom out and change direction and because of the magic of a fractional reserve system all that money will multiply many many many times over leading to massive inflation.

If that's not your point (and I can't imagine you think it is):  Why would conceding be the most respectable thing for McCain to do at this point?  Would you apply the same reasoning to a candidate who shared all of your political views and values and was running against a candidate who you strongly disagreed with, given how much is at stake in this election?","1225563664"

Last night I went on the ""University Halloween Party"" quest with a few guys from my guild. We defeated the ""Bouncer"" really easily but once inside had difficulty performing the ""Get Laid"" achievement.

We spent a lot of time ""fighting"" in the ""arena"" but spent all our money on ""health potions"". We took a break from the quest to stock up on items at Donalds Tavern then moved on to the next location in the quest, ""Party at Residential College"". At this point guild members were dropping out, I think some of their connections were dodgy because they were getting weird lag and weren't making much sense on vent.

We gave up on the quest at about 4am with only mild success and a ""Mystical Number"" for next time. 8 hours of work for no achievements and around 100 gold lost. Apparently this quest was perfectly suited for our level, however I have heard that it is much easier for Tank characters. No recommendations to anyone coming from me.

I live in Dallas, and so does this other guy. He's my only close friend from college who lives anywhere near me.

He's been working at Blockbuster for two years and his quality of life sucks,  he basically sleeps on the floor in a house he shares with four other people. This is making him depressed, and I think he is becoming suicidal, so I want to help him find work very badly.

At this point a high-paying job is not important, just anything modest, that gives him industry related experience and gives him a better standard of living than Blockbuster. 

What kind of jobs can a person with an MA in personal finance apply for that are below their normal pay grade? What else can he do to find work? *Any* work that's better than blockbuster and has something to do with his degree would improve on his present situation.","1225563755"

The Christian right better watch it's eternal ass, because if the shite they subscribe to is true then they will burn in hell for their deeds.

The laws governing morality are wrong, and the idea that you would jail someone for doing whatever they want with their own body is despicable. That why cops are stupid assholes, anyone of any reasonable intelligence and conscience couldn't possibly enforce the laws that they do. 

I'm tired of people defending law enforcement. The way I see it there are only two kinds of cops.

2. Just plain ignorant-Lacks the ability to process complex thoughts about morality and instead just assumes that the lawmakers are honest hard working guys who just want to make the world a better place. They will enforces the laws of the land and truly feel good about doing so. Blindly ignorant to the travesties they commit each day they slither through life sucking off the big government tit.

Also, although I can't really quantify it, LaTeX pdfs just ""look better"" than OO ones to me. They are also text-searchable, which OO ones aren't (or at least I haven't figured out how to make them).

It allows you to specify *exactly* what you want a document to look like, and then you can forget about it--no worrying about the formatting being thrown off later, as with Word/OO. Don't be thrown off by how old it is--it is still used extensively in the academic community (at least in the sciences).

Doing tables in LaTeX can be kind of painful though--you can't just copy/paste in a csv, rather you have to run a regex on it to get it formatted correctly (maybe there's a better way than this though). In the worst case you could screenshot your figures/tables and just use images in LaTeX.

The difference is in where the new lines have been drawn, and what each side has come to symbolize for the opposition. It's not just the same old fistfight between two virtually identical guys this year: because of the rhetoric and tone of the election, it's much more personal. 

If McCain wins on the basis of rigged machines, I believe there will be serious trouble. 

Ironically though, because so many people have been thinking the same thing, riots and civil disturbances might become *less* likely, and the anger and passions built up may be mitigated into truly effective campaigns to oust the administration. If we could organize to bring a single man this far against these odds, we could certainly organize enough to overturn an invalid Presidency. Our Constitution provided well for that.

Because we're already facing the potential outcome honestly, it might make us redirect obviously self-harmful energy into a more precise strike at the perpetrators of the coup. 

So no, we won't accept it, and while there may or may not be riots, there will be enough anger to seriously undermine any attempt at actually governing that way. ","1225564032"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Do you know why the Gamecube controller is awesome? It's because *every single button* has a totally distinct profile. It's impossible to confuse A for B for X and Y while not looking at the controller (which you shouldn't be, since if you are you're not looking at the game).

This is, of course, less of an issue on a touch screen where you're looking at what you're poking at, of course, but it is in people's psychological nature to want (a) uniformity of interface (which touchscreens exist primarily to avoid) and (b) *tactile* distinguishability of interface elements, which is utterly impossible on a flat screen. (Self-deforming touchscreens could avoid this, but I don't see that happening for a *long* time.) You can also run your fingers over a physical interface and get a feel for it, something which most touchscreens would interpret as interaction but which I would imagine could be worked around pretty easily.

Conclusion: touchscreens are a nice idea in principle, but they're too dynamic and the technology is not in place yet for them to work well with human psychology.","1225564092"

While I am a gun owner and even a lifetime NRA member, I would have problems at work if it was known I voted (early) for Obama. In fact, it's worse than that; I voted for only one Republican.  Quite a few of my co-workers have been busy drinking the Kool-Aid, and I can't risk the potential fallout.  Hopefully, some of my co-workers are as I am - secret Obama supporters. 

The country is tanking due to the Republicans and their failed economic policies.  The loss of freedoms under Bush and the Republicans appalls me.  If I have to fight Obama and the Democrats regarding gun control issues, I will when the time comes.  Meanwhile, the larger issue of stopping the Republicans takes precedent over the smaller issue of gun rights.  Besides, there seems to be a larger chance that we would be forced to use our firearms (as prescribed by the Second Amendment) with Republicans in control than with the Democrats.  Also, John McCain's positions on gun issues are just not far enough from Obama's to make much of a difference.

New Hampshire ranks with the best of western europe.  The US Virgin islands are worse than South Africa and Colombia.

This is plainly absurd, the word ""smart"" is defined around human intelligence as your ability to solve human centric problems.

If we broaden the definition to any problem, some of them a cuttlefish will find easier to solve but that doesn't make it smarter on the whole.

Inane claptraps like you who spew emotionally fueled statements with no meaning or point except to make you feel warm and fussy make me pretty sure I would like most cuttlefish better than many humans but that doesn't make them smarter than any human, even severely retarded ones.","1225564954"

The other folks I met were quite nice. I listened to them, and came to the conclusion that if we (Americans) have to support one side of it, we were definitely supporting the wrong one. I like to think justice is part of who we are, part of what it is to be American, but Israeli Jews certainly seem like the oppressors, from the outside looking in.

For example, when paying my tuition, I must look up my fee invoice on the college's CMS deal (which incidentally is also a piece of shit). So I got to login, and bring up the onscreen keyboard. The great thing about this keyboard is that the buttons are really tiny and the keyboard has symbols in nonstandard locations. There's also no indication of what key you've pressed. So after 9 attempts of putting in my password, I finally succeed and log in. After this though, the text size for the small screen is not adjusted, so all the links are excessively tiny and hard to select for anybody that is not a 4-year-old. Something that should take about 2 minutes to do took on the order of 10x that long because the kiosk software was terrible.

These guys didn't just save the company billions... they saved the company, *period.* The employees' decisions kept them from going the way of Lehman or Bear Stearns.

If they don't pay out bonuses, these employees will leave for other banks, other industries,  retire, or simply stop working 70-hour weeks.

Which will make Goldman dumber, exactly what we don't need in order to get the economy going again.

It would be like the Apple board of directors saying, ""Hey, our stock tanked this year"" and cutting off the stock options of Steve Jobs and his best guys even though it wasn't really their fault.

&gt; It seems like scantron is the best solution. Easy to count, easy to use, easy to re-count and look for wrong markings.

I'm cool with that. As long as it's a situation where a human can read and count the ballots without any technology, I am probably in favor of it.

In fact, I'd like to see the aforementioned journal system used with the scantron counting. Whenever I hear about a recount having different results than the original count, I wonder: how is that even possible? It must either be due to human error or machine error.

I want to know how many votes were read wrong, not just what the new tally is. For example: it is possible for 3000 votes to be misread the first time, and have only a one vote difference in the final result.

"science","t5_mouw","What defines the Catholic church is its adherence to tradition and convention - none of which cover the abuses of the church (the sex scandals) but which indicate that the church is unlikely to ever embrace sodomy or abortion so long as it believes its opposition has a theological grounding.

That said, the church is not hostile to homosexuality as an orientation, just the physical sexual act - which is probably just as good as being categorically anti-gay to most, but the distinction between thought and action seems important in understanding Catholic psychology.

The church does not regard itself as a ""tool"" or ""science"" for human happiness; it regards itself as a church in service of an objectively existing God who has specific rules.  As such, it is not going to adapt to the times, unless and until its theoretical understanding and interpretation of the Bible changes.  

In other words, the only way the church is going to change its stances on those issues is if it comes to a theological understanding that neither abortion nor homosexual sex offend God, regardless of how many members it loses.  It will not change its position merely to retain membership.  If it does, it will lose its most valuable base, traditionalist, conservative Catholics.

As Catholicism is opposed to pre-marital sex (fornication), we're a long way from that.  But I would emphasize that it has always been the position of the church to disapprove of the sin as a kind of sadness in the way it separates the individual from God, rather than a hatred for the sinner.  This is not necessarily true of Catholics themselves (not all of them), but is true of the teachings of the church.","1225565422"

"science","t5_mouw","Um... yes there is. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the Pope, I'm glad to hear such an influential christian take a stand against the irrational. but there is a fundamental difference between any religion and empirical science. 

Empirical science, in it's truest form, presupposes nothing, and builds a worldview from discernible independent facts (at least as far as one can within the bounds of philosophy) then tests that worldview against future facts. If the facts don't fit that worldview, the model is changed. It is the FACTS that are supreme in science, not authority, or any particular theory (not that you would guess that listening to all the amateur evolutionary biologists on here- funnily, evolution has become a form of gospel to people who claim to be gnositically (sic) atheist). Religion of any sort presumes some worldview, whether that be olympians, cosmic zombies or yes, a perfectly rational evolution (it is in fact mathematically chaotic in nature, thus not really giving us anything to work on, see the work of Sir Robert May), and offer to help you find a way that you can get to that presupposed perfection (being heaven, nirvana, the eternal feast at valhalla, again, you must be the best procreator of your generation, whatever), by implication telling you that you, in your current form are imperfect. Most often this is used by people who suffer from low esteem or some obvious defect such as a disease or disability. A classic example is the use of the '12 step' program to 'help' alcoholics convert to christianity. Basically, if they didn't tell you the world was the way they said it was, none of them would have anything to sell you.  In addition, they provide alternate social value systems, whereby the 'weak' of society can do something which they are then told puts them above their social betters (when looking from a materialistic point of view). Examples of this would be the false 'humility' of Christians that they actually use to feel they are superior to the 'sinners' (more difficult for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven), or a buddhist refusing to fight and claiming that by not fighting, he in fact wins. This is obvious bollocks, no matter how cleverly you rationalize it (and yes, I agree with non violence as the cost of destruction is usually too high to both parties, but there is a limit to that philosophy, sometimes you just need to stop and fight). I appreciate these are stereotypes I'm talking about, but I hope you get my general meaning. Effectively, I'm saying for religion, it is the WORLDVIEW (akin to a theory) that is most important, and as such, is far FAR less amenable to change than the scientific model of knowledge/experience is. Also, it has 0% ability to adapt to new facts.. for example, the world is round, we evolved from apes, the world is 5 billion years old. Of course, the reason religion is so socially pervasive is because it appeals to our idea of authority in some form of all knowing figure (i.e. priest/monk). No scientist can be absolutely sure of his position, new facts may arise. For a man of religious mind, this is an irrelevancy, as the 'true' model is already known allowing for total certainty, albeit based on a falsehood. People follow those who are certain and give the impression of leadership, not those who say, ""Yes, but I may be wrong..."". Intellectually dishonest, but that is the reality of human power politics, at least as far as I'm aware. 

This is a bit of a trick on the Pope's part imho. He sees that many catholics will be forced to reassess their beliefs as technology (the applied child of science) bears more and more fruit. Really, praying doesn't have the same efficacy as modern medicine. Whereas in the olden days the church(es) would sell the vain hope of salvation from life's sufferings (such as disease, hunger, the cold, death) at places such as Llords in france (look at the medieval business of 'sacred' relics for how big a market this was), modern science now provides real relief (in the main) from many of these problems. Indeed, with more money and research the promise is there that all of these problems can be alleviated with time, science holds the objective promise of a potential universe to explore with a massively increased lifespan within our generational lifespan... pretty awesome imho. Objectively, the old religions can't compete with this directly. It is in this that they are so different. The religions may have provided frameworks of hope whereby one could face the difficulties of life, but science, in actual fact, removes these difficulties. 

So anyway, I feel that the Pope has very wisely tried to reconcile the catholic church with the march of scientific progress, however, if there was ever a situation where there was unchecked religious control, the old demons of irrational though, prejudice and fear of the strange would manifest themselves, as can be seen in Iran, the bible belt of America, and even currently in the once peaceful hindu societies of india. Indeed, even the Lama's of tibet used to cut the tongues, eyes and noses off  and left them to die in the Tibetan plateaus, people who dared questioned their orthodoxy.  This is more an artifact of human nature than any particular religion, but only science can tackle this head on as only it will deal with the objective, rather disturbing, reality. 

This is the difference, religion is predicated on one lie or another. If you question that lie, and that particular religion is powerful in your area, you will suffer serious consequences. An analogous situation exists in science within the scientific establishment when you challenge the status quo, or the 'scientific dogma' of the day. In this case you may lose funding and political allies, even though you may be objectively right. Still, Science still has it's heart a culture of interested skepticism (i.e. people will listen to anything, but will be harsh upon analysis if the facts don't support the idea in question) so this limits the level of character assassination, at least to some degree.

Thus, while I welcome any measure to lay aside social difference between those who believe whatever they choose and those who would prefer external validation of their beliefs, the two are markedly different philosophically.

I do, of course, support everyone's right to choose their personal religion/ lifestyle, but I would suggest that any society, especially ones the size of our modern societies, based on anything less than reason and rational discourse will certainly implode over a certain time given they are using arbitrary subjective measures to judge each others' actions and those of others. If you have several large groups doing this and not checking each other by any reasonable objective means, then self reenforcing friction is bound to escalate as a matter of course. It is for this reason that I would always advocate the purely secular state, as it gives the ground from which all other religions/philosophies would flourish.

... but still, kudos to the Pope, I like the idea of being able to discuss matters rationally with Christians, rather the horrible luddite ignorance which is arising in some wings of the Evangelical movement.

Consider the recent arguments about the domestic violence ads on [DART](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/search?q=DART&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) and the general vilification of men and exoneration of women.

Only after thousands of comments did the sponsoring agency [acknowledge that women could also be violent.](http://glennsacks.com/blog/?p=2893)

Then there's this:

From Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology, 2005, Volume 20, Number 1 [1]For the 50 serial killers who killed with lust as a primary motive, the following breakdown of abuse was found:Abuse of all types excluding neglect was significantly higher in the serial killer population. For serial killers, the prevalence of physical abuse was 36%; sexual abuse was 26%; and psychological abuse was 50%, compared with 6%, 3%, and 2% respectively. Neglect was equally prevalent in the serial killer (18%) and societal norm populations. Look at Table 2: Comparison of serial killers to the general population.


According to a study by the University of Florida, men and women who witnessed abuse as children were significantly more likely to be either perpetrators (41%) or victims(53%) of physical abuse against or from their intimate partners. [2] Additionally,”there is an alarmingly high rate of sexual abuse by females in the backgrounds of rapists, sex offenders and sexually aggressive men - 59% (Petrovich and Templer, 1984), 66% (Groth, 1979) and 80% (Briere and Smiljanich, 1993). A strong case for the need to identify female perpetrators can be found in Table 4, which presents the findings from a study of adolescent sex offenders by O’Brien (1989). Male adolescent sex offenders abused by “females only” chose female victims almost exclusively.”[3]

"programming","t5_2fwo","The problem with an address book import is that everything else would still need to be manually added.  This functionality would be better served by a link to a vCard which would (on many systems) already prompt to ask if you want to import the address book entry.

I can see the click-to-call aspect, and I do actually have an IP phone on my desk at work... I may play with it a bit next week to see if it knows how to do international dialing (though I suspect it doesn't... it doesn't even know how to get an outside line... I need to store the 9 for an outside line in the phone list).

So, the answer basically boils down to enabling click-to-call for a small number of people.  The question that begs is how much of a problem does not having it create?

I would suggest that this is a non-problem.  The fact that Nokia (the company which wrote the original RFC) does not use tel: links anywhere I can find on their site supports this.  If a company won't even eat their own dogfood, it strongly suggests that nobody should.","1225565907"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","OK, this is coming from someone who prefers smoking joints as opposed to a bong or vaporizer.  So, the smell is a factor.

I just moved into my new apartment about a month ago, and when me and my brother first moved in, we smoked pretty much indiscriminately, anywhere, anytime.  I have a Russian neighbor upstairs who doesn't smoke pot, and furthermore is incredibly propagandized and biased towards pot.

So one day, he came down, drunk, and threatened to call the police.  Now, I don't really care about that, but he does have children, and I wanted to cover up my smoking for the children's sake.  FOR THE CHILDREN!!!

Anyways, me and my brother set up a ventilation chamber in our apartment to take care of the smell.  This chamber will differ depending on the window configuration in your apartment.  You will either have to have detailed knowledge of aerodynamics, replete with formulas, or use the caveman tactic of trial and error.  (I used the latter) Have 3 fans (minimum) handy and place one in front of a window, and another in the path of the first fan, but pointing out of a window across the room.  Then, set up a fan blowing the other way in between the first two fans but off to the side.  (not in their paths)  This should create a ventilation shaft that will blow all the smoke out of one window.  Make sure this window is safe and is the only one open.

Also, smoking in a corner of the house that does not have windows helps.  By the time the smoke is diffused throughout the house, the smell is negligible.

My neighbor hasn't come down since.

And of course, pull those shades/blinds.","1225565961"

It's difficult to argue that there is no 'gay agenda' because gay rights groups are going around getting 5 year olds to sign pledges they'll support homosexuals.

Had they gotten kids to sign pledges saying they'd support, I dunno, religious people from being attacked it's the same thing. They're just children and they don't understand these matters in depth to warrant having them do these things. It's something activists seem to do for kicks, they think they're doing well.

If it ever comes to a five year old saying 'I hate gay people and you're gay' or 'muslims should leave the country because they don't belong here' then it should be handled as an individual case.

But the fact that it is not a profitable business in and of itself does not mean it is not necessary. A round trip peak ticket is already $26 to NYC. Without government subsidies, that same ticket would be $40 or more, and there would be significant service cuts. This would force many commuters who cannot afford this to find alternative means of commuting to NYC, such as driving, which is extremely inefficient and costly to the environment and the government(needing to construct more highways to account for the spike in drivers). That the government subsidizes an otherwise unprofitable business may be socialist in nature, but it provides a necessary and useful public service that helps to ensure equality of opportunity, which is the basis and foundation of the American economy.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Yes of course you are right that ethnicity has nothing to do with propensity to idiocy. But that's not at all what I meant. What I mean by saying that your attitude is ethnocentric, is that you project the current social and cultural reality of the United States onto the rest of the world. As you say, your observations are from personal experience. My guess is that these observations have been limited to people who experience similar social dynamics, in a region where religion, or lack thereof, is at the forefront of a sort of identity battleground.  

If you travel to, say, Ecuador or Morocco or Mexico, I think you would find that most people are decent and moral, certainly pleasant, as well as religious. There would also be assholes and morons. Both the ""moral"" and ""immoral"" people (if it were possible to neatly separate these into two groups) would be religious. I don't think you would see a negative correlation between faith and morality.   

Since you mention Hindus, I feel compelled to comment that I think Hinduism is really overrated in the West. I traveled quite a bit in India, and on the whole I can say that I had wonderful experiences and that people were friendly and welcoming. At the same time, one sometimes perceives deep misogyny, sexual exploitation of children is rampant, and I have yet to encounter a group that rivals Hindus in class inequality. India also has its share of Hindu extremism and violence against other religious groups.

But user interfaces evolved pretty quickly to take good advantage of the capabilities mice offered.  The thing is that you want all of the above options (and more!), but for different tasks.  

A number of interaction techniques can make very good use of a touch screen and multi-touch capability.  Things like manipulating groups or various kinds of geometric manipulations for example.

"politics","t5_2cneq","In recent days John McCain has attacked Barack Obama for being an academic who is out of touch with ordinary Americans. At the same time, McCain’s running mate, Sarah Palin, told a crowd in Greensboro, North Carolina, that she loves visiting small towns because that was the real America. Upon hearing this, I have just one question to ask. 

When did ignorance become something to aspire to in this country? 

This is the country that invented the airplane, the mass produced automobile, the computer, satellite communications, and the laser, just to name a few. Our movies, music, and media are our number one export. American colleges are so well regarded that students from all over the world come to this country to study. 

I mean, my god, we are the country that put men on the moon in nine years. Nine years! That is unheard of in the whole history of the human race. Think about the fact that from the first flight of the airplane to landing men on the moon, only 66 years had passed. That’s just one human lifetime! 

So how is it that Joe Six-Pack, or for that matter, Joe the Plumber, is somehow now a more desirable ideal than someone who puts themselves through law school and goes on to teach constitutional law for eight years? If someone’s going to be running this country, I for one, hope that they have at least read the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 

With the challenges that we face as a nation (a massive federal deficit, lax financial regulation, and a broken health care system, to name a few) shouldn’t we want the smartest people we have, regardless of party affiliation, to be coming up with solutions to these problems? Then give it to the Joe six-packs to implement the fixes and see what works. Or do we somehow think that ordinary Americans are going to come up with the brilliant answers that will enable us to climb out of this gigantic mess that we’re all in? 

I sometimes wonder if all of this anti-intellectualism is driven by the presumption that educated people are less likely to be god-fearing than the average American. While it is true that people with college degrees are more likely to question established systems of belief and less likely to pursue the kind of Christian conservatism that is in vogue today, that doesn’t mean that they have a predisposition to be anti-God, or anti-American. And isn’t it ironic that some of the most conservative and wealthiest Americans are also some the most educated - after all, President George W. Bush has an M.B.A. from Harvard. 

It is my personal belief that God grants each of us certain talents and abilities. But these are only potentials, so unless we work hard to hone and develop our innate skills, they will lie fallow. If we do work hard, then God will uphold his part of the bargain by insuring that opportunities come our way to not only further our talents, but to use them for the greater good. Therefore, we glorify God by making the most of the gifts he has given us. And by this measure, God despises waste. 

If someone has the ability to become a doctor, or to write a great symphony, or find a cure for breast cancer, we should, as a people, be doing everything we can encourage and enable them. Because if that person fails to realize their God given gifts, then everyone in America looses, and we will never know what might have been. 

People forget that the founding fathers of our country were not, for the most part, ordinary Americans. They were doctors, lawyers, and military officers – almost all of them wealthy land owners. But they understood the plight of the common man, and had the wisdom and foresight to craft a government that would treat every man equal under the law.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Ah, I suspected you meant something else by _legitimate ignorance_.  It's unpopular to view political apathy and ignorance as systemic, rather than the result of a flawed citizenry.  Nevertheless, I maintain that view primarily out of my own experience: I used to be politically ignorant and apathetic, and proud of it.  My science education eventually forced me to take politics seriously.  If a person does not have a reasonable model of human nature (inspired, hopefully, by science), no amount of research will help because without a framework in which to analyze policies and politicians they'll never make sense of the data.  That framework is primarily what I acquired from the sciences.  I have no regrets about being politically inactive in my past--it was, in my view, a ""legitimate ignorance"".  I would have been stupid to spend my time researching political issues.  Actually, I'm sure I did plenty of research for my high school political ""science"" classes, but my memory of the facts has completely evaporated because the relevance of the court-cases and laws did not impinge upon my world view.  It was, for me, a waste of time.

The task of acquiring the ""right points of view"" must precede an education proper, and I do not know if there's a systematic way to teach a scientific world view.  I've tried arguing my views to intelligent people, starting from basic premises, but usually encounter stiff resistance (which is expected and good).  It's not something that can be effected in a day, maybe not even a year of concerted effort.  For me, it was gradual and saltatory... the transition probably took three years.  For a lot of people the opportunity probably doesn't exist at all.  In that context, political indifference is a rational response--their ignorance is legitimate.","1225567275"

It's not just America...Canada does it too.  We celebrate a LOT of holidays in our family- even though most of the adults are agnostic now, I was raised Anglican, my husband was raised Jewish, my ex-husband was raised Catholic but is pagan now and I believe that his ex-girlfriend was raised Methodist.  That adds up to a lot of holidays throughout the year, most of which my kids celebrate with some combination of parents. 

Even if it's not a ""religious"" holiday, there are so many great rituals that go along with most holidays that make them well-worthwhile celebrating with your kids.  Christmas baking with kids is one of the most awesome things ever- of course it's easier to just buy things at the store, but it kind of misses the point. 

My ex-husband loves taking the kids to pick apples with him, and they love the fact that they bring them home and we magically turn them in to apple crisp or pie or whatever. My parents are from Pennsylvania Dutch background, and sausage making every year is still a big occasion.  

Food is one of the great social things that we do, and it's pretty pitiful when it's given such short shrift.  I definitely take advantage of fast food on occasion, but I'm still horrified by my friends (I'm 44), who have never made a batch of cookies from scratch.  It's a shame. ","1225567343"

I'll agree that a lot of what I see with touch screens are primitive and ungainly, but the same could (and was) said about most mouse/pointer user interface elements in the old days.  

To me the real issue is with touch screens and kiosks style applications, where you are trying to provide a non-casual interaction in a field situation with potentially inexperienced users.  But even there most of the problems have to do with poor interface/application design, rather than any intrinsic limitations in the technology (calibration issues aside!)

&gt;Our goal is to promote the cause of anti-Sharia; we don't care about blog promotion per se.

Then submit stories directly from their link.

&gt;And you'd do well to stop making shit up. There's nothing in the Koran about cussing. There's, however, plenty about murdering infidels. Would you rather we chose that path?

From what I can see you don't really understand the Quran and I already quoted what is written in it and the Hadeeth, if you have nothing good to say then don't talk. it is that simple.

Religious extremists like to take things out of context or twist them to fit their own world view, you are an extremist in the sense you said that 'it's good' to use vulgar language when communicating with me even though the truth is it is never good to swear and insult anyone, heck, Muhammed (PBUH) even said that insulting someone else's beliefs is forbidden.

You sound young and misguided, hopefully with time you'll wisen up and realize using offensive language does not get you anywhere, neither does trying to sweep Islams teachings under the rug and pretending they don't exist just because you don't like it (such as the stuff about using vulgar language ;)).

I can say with relative certainty you don't understand your religion beyond what you see on the media and written by various people who are anything but authorities on the matter. This is largely because you want to sweep whole parts of it under the rug rather than gain a higher level of understanding. You're blissfully ignorant of your own faith. If you truly want to reform the image of Islam you should start by learning about Islam.

Islam requires the believer actively learn and understand his or her religion, it is not a passive thing, you can't just say 'I'm a Muslim' and not ever truly try to study Islam and understand what Islam is or worse yet, act like whole parts of the religion are worth naught despite being an integral part of it.

fifty years ago communism was the topic of the day and people had decided if they didn't do something about it we would all be communists by today. It went so far that the US went to war in Vietnam ending in their own defeat. They retreated, and now, so many years later no one is communist.

There was a famous Muslim scholar who said 'never hate your enemies too much because one day they might become your friends, and never love your friends too much because one day they might become your enemies'. I'm sure you already associate yourself with far right wing types who populate websites like LGF. 

Hate only begets hate, all you're going to do is hurt both yourself and Islam in the end if you keep following a path of willful ignorance to your own religion.","1225567593"

&gt;  Stalin had promised his wartime allies at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 that Soviet forces would attack the Japanese in mainland China ‘within two or three months of the German surrender’.  Three months would expire on 8 August 1945, and on that date the Soviet Far Eastern Army attacked Japan’s formidable Kwantung Army in Manchuria, forty-eight hours after the A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  Before both events the Soviet Union had relayed to Washington information that Japan was ready to quit the war.  Revelation of this later raised questions as to the motive in dropping the A-bombs when the war was practically won.

Did you just imply that something has less validity because it comes out of a particular ethnicity/religion? Gotta wonder whos racist.

Well, it apparently didnt exist before Arafat, and the arab countries made it quite clear they dont want any of that ""palestinian"" country for any purpose other than capture and annex it. Know your history much?

Then again, right now there of course exists a necessity for a ""palestinian"" national state, because the originally fictional national identity of the ""palestinian"" arabs has now materialized, but the reality is that such a state is not going to happen because the ""palestinian"" liberation groups did everything they can to undermine its viability.

&gt; Only because they were afraid of the crazy fuckers with the nukes. That's the only reason you exist now.

You know you're a racist cunt when you have to make shit up to support your argument. There weren't any nukes when they wrote the partition plan, and you know it.

&gt; Why aren't I doing what? What the fuck are you rambling on about?

Why aren't you going down the history lane, on which traceable uninterrupted presence of jewish people in Palestine is clearly marked, as well as the true cultural and religious importance of it to the jews, unlike that of the ""palestinian"" arabs, who didn't even call themselves ""palestinians"" until last century, and whose affinity to ""Islamic holy sites"" is a crude recent fabrication?

I'm 44 now, and I know that I've had spaces of exceptionally low sex drive- when I was pregnant with triplets, a few months after they were born, the year that we found out that they were autistic and my mom died, and when my daughter had cancer.  Now that pre-menopause has hit it's wildly up and down, to the point where I'm driving my husband insane because I'm either climbing all over him or building walls out of pillows so that he won't actually touch me in bed (fortunately, that's pretty seldom).  Talking to most of my female friends, those kinds of cycles aren't unusual at all.  

I think that female sexuality (and male, for that matter), is a lot more complex than most studies show. I can guarantee that if you would have asked me about sex when I was 31 years old,  and 6 months pregnant, I wouldn't have been bothered by my lack of sex drive either. 

I disagree with Ingrid Nygaard's response...""“focus on symptoms that are bothersome to the person. A condition is not abnormal until it’s bothersome, and that is a little bit of what the authors of the article did.""  While obviously if something's bothersome to a singular person it's a problem, it seems to me that if that person is in a relationship sexual issues should also be taken in context with what the other partner thinks is a problem.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","As I mentioned, Russia staged large military exercise there not long before the war. Offcourse they were ready and had plans what to do. 

As for Russian military, I think they are still dug into old Soviet way of thinking .. just check how much damage Chechens managed to do. True, they are changing, probably as a result of Chechen wars, but old habits die hard.

During our war in 1991 ex-Yugoslav army deployed similar tactics in the battle of Vukovar and result was basically the same ... some 1800 defenders were able to hold much bigger and larger force for over three months, city was leveled to the ground and serbian forces took massive casaualties.

Recall that the actual paper trail of receipt copies that were printed on rolls of paper tape and stored in boxes within the tallying computers, were found in dumpsters and on porches and loading docks across the state.

When observers pointed out that the paper trails were being thrown out, or stored insecurely, police officers took custody of the garbage bags full of paper tapes.

However, when observers asked to check those tapes at a later date, they noticed that many required signatures were missing, and the dates on the printed rolls were 2 days after the election.  The few rolls in the garbage bags that were checked by observers on election eve, had the correct dates and signatures.

But some of the same precincts represented by rolls with the correct dates and signatures that had been found in the trash, later were represented by unsigned rolls, printed 2 days later.  Substitutions in the paper trails had clearly been made.  The Ohio Secretary of State and the Board of Elections certified the results, so they are clearly reponsible for any anomalies.","1225568491"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I tend towards thinking that the Republican party realized that the gaggle of idiots that were leading the primaries early couldn't possibly be elected.  So they approached McCain and made him an offer he couldn't refuse:

We'll make you the Republican nominee, and you toe the hard right, conservative hawk line.

McCain, at 72 years old, knowing that this would be his swan song, sold his soul to the devil.  He rocketed back from nowhere in the primary season, and here we are.

He's a different man now than he was running in 2000.  He used to be lucid and reasonable (though I disagreed with him on many things).  He used to answer questions from the press until *the press* got tired and went home.  In 2000, had he been nominated, he would have won the presidency *fairly.*  His positions then were far and away most attractive to a majority of Americans.  Not, unfortunately, to a majority of Republicans.

This is it for McCain, and he knows it.  He's said a lot of things through gritted teeth, because he knows he's given up on himself in order to take his last possible shot at history.

The really unfortunate thing is that if he'd run on his own ideals, he would probably have still gotten the nomination, and would be giving Obama a much stronger run.  The nation would be having a real discussion about issues now, instead of a circus of followers for each candidate, and a tragic comedy side-show in Palin.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Well the bible is just simply a book that was written by men, translated numerous times by men and even hand picked and assembled by men. This is all well established history. So it is not a source for objective information. It is a compilation of bronze age mythology and the traditions and morals derived from it are abominable by todays standards (which believe in equality despite skin color, sex, etc).

First off, you're missing the point. If I do accept the Bible as the infallible word of God (which I do), then God must be supernatural. 

Second, you can't prove that it was ""written by men"" or ""hand-picked and assembled by men"". I, however, can prove the converse. The scientific foreknowledge in the Bible is evidence that it was inspired by God. For example, [Ecclesiastes 1:7](http://www.carm.org/kjv/Ecc/Ecc_1.htm) describes the water cycle (Ecclesiastes 1:6 arguably describes the jet stream, too) and [Isaiah 51:6](http://www.carm.org/kjv/Isaiah/Isaiah_51.htm) describes what will eventually happen to the universe according to the [Second Law of Thermodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics#Versions_of_The_Law). 

You may object that the Bible also contains unscientific statements, so bring any such objections to me to refute. 

As for your statement concerning morals, I think that it is hypocritical to criticize the Bible's morals when, even according to your worldview, morals are entirely subjective. There is no objective standard of morality in your worldview. That said, I don't believe that there are any racist or sexist statements in the Bible.

&gt;However I will bend over backwards and speculate that the Christian God exist. Now as described in the bible he is omnipotent (all powerful creator of the universe and all its laws), omniscient (knows everything about the universe future and past) and Omnibenevolent (Loves everyone unconditionally). If this was the case, if God was Omniscient, Omnibenevolent and Omnipotent as the bible and its followers claim then God's will would be reality. It wouldn't take a ceremony to change the universe, it would simply already and always have existed the way God willed it to.

&gt;However the universe in which we objectively experience does not match the universe which would exist if an omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent god exist. Simply making our bones not made out of calcium, simply making us more resistant to radiation as several other creatures are could have saved the human race unfathomable misery and it if god loves everyone his will would have changed the universe and it would have always been that way. The universe we live in could only be capable of having an evil god which specifically wishes us to suffer and has the control to change it and always have changed it or the deist view which is far more rational: god doesn't exist or doesn't participate in the universe after creation.

First of all, I don't believe that it says anywhere in the Bible that God is omnipotent. Indeed He is very powerful, but can't do some things, for example, lie. It's also up for debate to what degree He is omnibenevolent. 

He may want for us to be happy (and He will provide that to believers after death) but He is also a just God. He punishes men for their sins. This includes the original sin. If the world weren't fallen, there would be no need to make us resistant to radiation because there would be no illness or death. But God allows suffering because that's what the human race deserves. 

&gt;Occam's Razor would imply you would remove any god because it doesn't really add anything but simply complicates matters more.

Ockham's Razor is only to be used where there is no evidence for a proposition. But there is evidence which we are debating. 

&gt;I have experienced my whole life without ever seeing god. There are billions of other people that have never seen the christian god. That is observable evidence that there is no christian god. It requires blind faith.

It doesn't require blind faith. It's possible to know things without seeing or experiencing them. It requires faith, (defined here (roughly) as belief in things not seen) but not necessarily blind faith. The difference between the two is that evidence can fit into the definition of one but not the other.

&gt;You make that claim without evidence or reason. Why couldn't the system just have infinite loops without a start? If it has no end that implies it has no start.

If there were infinite time (or cycles of universes) before the present, then we would never get to the present because we can't get past the infinity. An infinity is never-ending and to claim that we got to the present after an infinite amount of time would imply that the infinite events before the present came to a conclusion which is a contradiction in terms. 

Neither of us can prove whether time ends but even if it doesn't, this doesn't prove that it didn't begin.

&gt;As for time you are still misunderstanding the concept. This is a heavy physics concept but the universe is at least four dimensions if not more. It did not come from nothing it came form the singularity. If you are really interested check out a brief history of time. Hawking is much better at explaining complex physics concepts than I am. But I will try:

&gt;What we know as fact is this: the universe is expanding. Hubble discovered this and changed the way science thought about the universe. The universe is not only expanding but expanding at accelerating rates. The farther we look the faster its going. This is not because the matter getting farther apart but the space between the matter is expanding (which was understood through numerous things but mainly the fact that the objects really far away are moving faster than the speed of light). Now if you take this model of the universe and you start rewinding it - it all returns to one spot the singularity.

&gt;Now studying the first moments of the big bang is a huge project right now for astronomers and physicist so trying to jump in and understand is a huge task. All I can do is recommend reading more about because its constantly evolving field.

I'm still confused about how this implies that the Big Bang was the origin of time. According to you, time came from *something*, although time (the fourth dimension) came from the other three dimensions. This is a case of something from nothing not because it came from nothing but because something spontaneously produced something greater or at a higher level. But I don't think that I'm understanding and I suppose I will have to read Hawking's work before I will understand fully.

&gt;I don't have to disprove it because the burden of proof is on the person who asserts a god exist.

It's entirely possible you can get your company to foot the bill.  Four hundred bucks for a keyboard is chump change compared to worker's comp claims down the line.  Same goes for a quality chair.

Unfortunately, he doesn't seem willing to take any measures on either that truly set him apart from McCain, or promise to have any real impact given the nature of the situation we're in. His stance on gun control is a huge negative -- I can't understand why Dems keep trying to ban weapons instead of enforcing more strict background checks, which they'd have better luck with. Lastly, his voting record doesn't reflect favorably on his message of change, IMO. He talks change, but votes more of the same.

I might have considered Obama as the ""Lesser of two evils"" approach, but I think his gun control stance ruled that out for me.

Is this sentence incomplete or missing punctuation? In either case, the response may have been different, had we not had such a ill-informed leader making decisions for us. Most experts would argue that our current involvement in Iraq would not have occurred had Gore become president, because there was no relationship between the events.

Of course history isn't multiple choice. Neither is psychology. But, when you have nations that specifically invade other areas and seek to destabilize the existing populace for their own gain, as in west Africa during the slave trade years, consequences of centuries of that can have long-lasting effects, as any historian would proclaim. Perhaps this might shed some more light on it for you:

http://mars.wnec.edu/~grempel/courses/world/lectures/colonialafrica.html

Direct your doubts to that professor listed at the bottom of the page; such a professional might be more capable of illuminating the finer points of your misunderstandings.

But, I doubt you would. Since you characterized slavery as ""free cheap labor"", no amount of research material would make the truths of it any clearer. If you're grateful for slavery, acknowledge it. That ""better you than me"" mentality is just what makes America so great today.","1225569524"

The proof that has accumulated by now would be good enough to convict, except for the very short statutes of limitations, and the Supreme Court.

&gt; All Bush executive orders and signed bills could conceivably be voided since he was not in fact president.

That's a very nice theory, (especially when it comes to pardons), but the laws have been written to exclude that possibility, probably by guilty victors from the distant past.  My source for this is a New Yorker article from 2004.  Sorry I cannot be more specific.


Our best hope, and Obama's strategy, is to win so many states that Republicans cannot fix the vote in enough states to carry the election.  Note that I say Republicans, _not_ McCain.

 Candidates' gun control positions may figure in Pa. vote

 April 2, 2008 

 
	 ""I am not in favor of concealed weapons,"" Obama said. ""I think that creates a potential atmosphere where more innocent people could (get shot during) altercations.""

""35. Do you support legislation to ban the manufacture, sale and possession of
a. handguns?

While a complete ban on handguns is not politically practicable, I believe reasonable restrictions on the sale and possession of handguns are necessary to protect the public safety. In the Illinois Senate last year, I supported a package of bills to limit individual Illinoisans to purchasing one handgun a month; require all promoters and sellers at firearms shows to carry a state license; allow civil liability for death or injuries caused by handguns; and require FOID applicants to apply in person. I would support similar efforts at the federal level, including retaining the Brady Law.

b. assault weapons?

Yes.

c. ammunition for handguns and assault weapons?

I would support banning the sale of ammunition for assault weapons and limiting the sale of ammunition for handguns.

""But the campaign of Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama said that he ""...believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives. Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constititional.""

http://obama.senate.gov/news/050729-gunmakers_may_get_suitproof_ve/index.php

Obama is proposing to make it a felony for a gun owner whose firearm was stolen from his residence which causes harm to another person if that weapon was not securely stored in that home. 

He's proposing restricting gun purchases to one weapon a month and banning the sale of firearms at gun shows except for ""antique"" weapons. Obama is also proposing increasing the licensing fee to obtain a federal firearms license.      ....

 He's proposing that all federally licensed gun dealers sell firearms in a storefront and not from their homes while banning their business from being within five miles of a school or a park. He's also banning the sale of 'junk"" handguns like the popular Saturday Night Specials.""

Prices for goods and services fluctuated throughout the existence of the Empire, and the value of various denominations changed over time as well. Bronze coins were the most common type and a cursory glance of the picture of this new hoard seems to show common bronze coins of the late Roman period, with many made at the London mint, but there certainly could be some real rarities amongst the thousands found. I wish I could be on the team that gets to look through this hoard first!

Roman coins were minted in the multiple millions, so they are not all that rare, and even wonderfully preserved common varieties are very inexpensive to own.

I took a week or so to get used to it, but now I can type a lot faster with no wrist pain.  But you forgot to mention some of its best features:

1.  You can reprogram the keys.  I optimized them for programming and emacs.  It took several weeks of tweaking to get it just right, but now the keyboard layout is perfect for me.  Sure, you can do this in Linux in software, but this is a lot easier.   The only downside is that I am literally the only person in the world that can use this keyboard :).

2.  The foot pedals! I got the three-pedal one that plugs right into the keyboard.  It requires no drivers and I can map them to any key.  I choose control, alt, and shift, which are perfect for programming in emacs.  It makes my setup look crazy, but it makes me just a little bit faster with just a little big less wrist pain.

For example, Fantasy, Sci-fi, Anime, etc, and types of GENRE of RPG.

The Sci Fi genre has lots of aliens, space ships, lasers, etc.  Its a genre where science is to a point where its almost unthinkable to us in the present day.

The Fantasy genre typically has things like swords, dragons, magic, etc.  Typically its a sort medieval type world a la Dungeons and Dragons.
If you want a Fantasy GENRE rpg, you could do WoW, DDO, runescape, etc.  
If you want a Sci-Fi GENRE rpg, you could do Half life, etc.

McCain Funded Work Of Palestinian His Campaign Hopes To Tie To Obama

[Excerpt]

During the 1990s, while he served as chairman of the International Republican
Institute (IRI), McCain distributed several grants to the Palestinian research
center co-founded by Khalidi, including one worth half a million dollars.

A 1998 tax filing for the McCain-led group shows a $448,873 grant to Khalidi's
Center for Palestine Research and Studies for work in the West Bank. (See grant
number 5180, ""West Bank: CPRS"" on page 14 of this PDF.)

The relationship extends back as far as 1993, when John McCain joined IRI as
chairman in January. Foreign Affairs noted in September of that year that IRI
had helped fund several extensive studies in Palestine run by Khalidi's group,
including over 30 public opinion polls and a study of ""sociopolitical attitudes.""

Of course, there's seemingly nothing objectionable with McCain's organization
helping a Palestinian group conduct research in the West Bank or Gaza. But it
does suggest that McCain could have some of his own explaining to do as he tries
to make hay out of Khalidi's ties to Obama.

A few days will verify my accuracy but, despite what the polls and what so many non-accurate prognosticators are spewing here it is.....

McCain will win.

Sorry Obama worshippers.

The PC mob is not large enough yet to sway a national election.

For the record, this predictor doesn't care who wins since all candidates of the major political parties are mere figureheads for the elite ruling class.","1225570939"
"WTF","t5_2qh61","Jeez you like completely swerved around my comment.

And I didn't comment at all on defense. The reason the gun usually isn't used in defense is because the guy the gun is pointed at is scared of *drum roll* getting killed or hurt.

And didn't say there was a thing wrong with increasing accuracy. I was pointing out that you're increasing accuracy so you can kill/wound someone.

I'm simply asking what other uses the gun has than killing/wounding. I mean, you stated that using them only to kill isn't factual or based in reality. Even adding a snide comment at the bottom.

But when I simply asked what else they're used for... don't seem to have an answer.

I'm not even trying to prove a point, just asking for some information on your statement.","1225570940"

"politics","t5_2cneq","yes, quite frankly, I really think Planned Parenthood would keep such a person, the difference here is not that there would be a disagreement between them, but the situation might arise where despite such a candidate supports enough other items that are for the good of the country as a whole that such a phenomenon is not impossible.  The probability of such a thing happening is however quite low, since a majority of the time those claiming an ""anti-choice"" stance do as much thinking about the broad range of issues: as they have done about the issue of abortion, approaching them as well as that issue from an emotional instead of a rational basis.  

My wife and I ended up voting for an anti-choice candidate in previous elections because the balance of the good he did more or less out weighed the harm his anti-choice stance did. We continued to support the choice platform in other fashions, but voted for this candidate despite his platform. Which was unlike old friends who have thoughtlessly followed the directive of their pulpits, we considered the candidate as a whole instead of just one issue.  

I suspect that such a person would be unlikely to be the CEO of planned parenthood in the first place, but with a typical all good or all bad headset, you appear to assume that the only thing planned parenthood is about is abortions.  

Quite simply, to make a decision on only one aspect of any issue is pathetically lazy, and to swallow the gabble of NRA and the republican right is not just lazy, but nearly criminally so, since by doing so, you are not bothering with a everyone's responsibility to research the issues before making a decision on them.

His tax cuts for the middle-class will make it easier to pay expenses month-to-month.

My best friend's brother will come back from Iraq.

An increased focus on alternative energy and increased vehicle MPG standards should at least help to lower gas prices in the near future, while in the long-term making us less dependent on nations that hate us, giving them less of our money for them and their citizens commit further acts like 9/11.

Obama's dedication to find and capture Osama Bin Laden regardless of what national borders he crosses makes me think that Bin Laden will be far less likely to carry out another attack on the US.

Obama's intention to focus on Afghanistan means that ""the war on terror"" will get attention where it needs it, making the world a safer place.

I will no longer live in fear that my constitutional rights will be taken away by those in power simply for political gain under the guise of ""national security"".

Obama will be far more likely to enact some decent net neutrality laws so that my internet provider won't be able to slow down my service just because I use one web browser instead of another.

Obama will put an end to warrantless wiretapping, so I won't have to worry about Big Brother listening in on my phone calls.

All of this, of course, is above and beyond the changes in Washington that, while not directly affecting me, will make this country a better place in more general terms - ethics reform, a stricter policy in regards to lobbyists, an end to the unconstitutional expansion of executive power and the lack of accountability that has pervaded the highest seat of the land under Bush and would be unlikely to change much under McCain.

And of course, even beyond that is the other people I DON'T know, or at least not yet, who this would affect - the women who wouldn't die as a result of clothes hanger abortions after Roe V. Wade is overturned, the elderly cancer sufferer who isn't arrested for medical marijuana use that my state considers legal, the innocent man who isn't tortured in Guantanamo Bay because of a suspension of constitutional rights and the Geneva conventions.

It is easy to think of a situation where the redistribution of wealth actually goes to people who actively impede the rich man in his profits. Criminals who steal from the rich man's company or mug him on the street, report little income and get checks or breaks from the government.

The fact that your personal acquaintances seem to have fallen off on the wrong side of the intelligence curve suggests only that you yourself occupy that same dark valley.

Here's a very simple reason (the *genuine* reason) some people will vote for McCain over Obama:  They don't like Obama's policies.  

No rational person can deny this.  Go look at some polls; something like 20-25% of Americans still support President Bush.  That doesn't have anything to do with race.  Clearly some people just have very different political outlook than you.  If your parents hadn't passed down such inferior genes, you would have the intelligence to recognize this.

And here's an even simpler explanation:  *I* won't vote for Obama because he will raise my taxes quite a bit compared to McCain.  And I'm greedy like that.  If McCain were black, Chinese, or a Martian, I'd vote for him over a white guy who wanted to raise my taxes.

"science","t5_mouw","The Nicene Creed is the basic symbol of the Christian faith. The Catholic Church changed it very slightly with the filioque. It's essentially a list of things you confess to believing in in a literal sense. Though even believing in a literal interpretation of Genesis should not lead one to believe in a 7 day creation by how we view things. The Bible says that a day for God is like 1000 years for us, though even that isn't a definition of one day equaling 1000 years but that a day for God isn't the same as a day for us.

There are also historical aspects of the Bible that if you took simply as allegory you would have to dismiss things that are documented by non-religious texts.

This is the Nicene Creed which I mentioned earlier. It is to be taken literally and not interpretively. Reading it you can see how viewing Christ as a figurative person is not in line with Christian theology.
&gt;I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible;
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-Begotten, begotten of the Father before all worlds [1],
Light of Light, Very God of Very God [2] , begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father; by Whom all things were made.
Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man;
And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried;
The third day He arose again, according to the Scriptures;
And ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father;
And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead;
Whose Kingdom shall have no end.
And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the Father (the filioque would be here adding the words ""and from the son"");
Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke by the prophets.
And I believe in One Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.
I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sin.
I look for the Resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","While I believe veganism is preferable from both an ethics and environmental point of view (and I've been vegan for 10 years), we don't do anyone any favors by exhibiting elitist and absolutist, black &amp; white thinking.

Someone who cuts their meat consumption in half is taking a great step forward. Only about 5-10% of the population is ""vegetarian"", and that includes flexitarians and pescetarians. If 50% of the population ate 50% less meat, it would have a bigger positive effect than doubling the total number of vegetarians.

Choosing free-range/organic meat over industrial, factory farming is a positive choice. While we may not like it much, they're still considering the impact of their diets.

Going lacto-ovo vegetarian is a huge step and takes care of the vast majority of the ecological impact of their diet, as well as their contribution to animal suffering. 

Veganism is a fantastic additional step, and I think the preferable point to get for anyone who is committed to reducing their negative effects on animals &amp; the environment; but represents much smaller gains than the step from omni to vegetarian.

And if you ask freegans, raw foodists, and fruitarians, then us vegans aren't going nearly far enough. Paying the corporate capitalist system for our food, using up precious energy, and causing the  ground to be tilled and plants to killed. So selfish of us!

And none of us have anything over the [breatharians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia).

The point being, we should celebrate any decision a person makes towards more compassionate and environmentally responsible dietary choices. Not condemn them for not going far enough doesn't encourage anyone, and just makes us look like asses. 

Lead by example, rather than nagging them.

1. *Kommen* This should be ""Komm"", imperative second person instead of the formal you (third person plural, but it's a bit more difficult than that)
2. *sie* should be ""Du"", the *informal* you, but that is included in ""Komm""
3. *hier* should be ""her"", short for ""hier her""
4. *kuss* this has an umlaut, hence ""küss"". Note that this verb in this form usually has an ""e"" at the end, but omitting it is common.
5. *mir* should be ""mich"", accusative

So the correct sentence would be:

I've given a lot of thought to this topic and found that even Socialism is looked upon by many people as a way of keeping problems like our current economic crisis from happening.

Einstein put together a thoughtful argument back when actually promoting the idea, and explained why society as a whole would function better and last longer under a socialist system.

http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/Einstein.htm

I'm not trying to promote socialism,  but just the fact that it's just core greed and corruption that is the problem under any system.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The best keyboard and mouse you can find. The most silent case and HDDs (buy a couple, RAID-1 them) you can find. Two good monitors (quality of image first, size is secondary), dual-DVI graphics card. A CPU, a couple gigs of RAM.

You're building the computer for your personal use, hence it should be as easy on your body as possible. You also don't want to lose data, hence RAID-1 (also take piecewise backups to multiple locations and MD5 them, bit rot is nasty.)

A quadcore CPU or two will be nice for playing with parallelism. For cluster parallelism, you should also get a couple cheap (100-200€) boxes that have a CPU, RAM and a flash stick / small HDD, and stuff them into the basement. Extra points if they randomly fail, nothing like real experience in dealing with unreliable hardware.

Example workstation sans keyboard &amp; mouse:

* CPU: Intel Q6600 Core 2 Quad
* RAM: 4x2GB DDR2-800
* Mobo: Intel DP43TF
* GFX: MSI Zilent Nvidia 9800GT 1GB
* Case: Antec Sonata III
* HDDs: 2x200GB 2.5"" Samsung MP2 7200RPM
* Monitors: 2x22"" Eizo FlexScan S2201WSE 1680x1050
* Price: 1400€

Example cluster node:

* CPU: Athlon X2 4450E 2.3GHz
* RAM: 2GB DDR2-667
* Mobo: Asus M2N-MX MicroATX with integrated video
* Case: Some cheapo
* HDD: 4GB USB flash stick
* Price: 150€ / 200€ with a 160GB disk

With a budget of 2k€, you can buy the workstation and four cluster nodes (or upgrade the displays to 2x24"" HP LP2475w) and spend a few happy, tinkering-filled weeks setting everything up.

You might also want to use Amazon's EC2 instead of your own cluster, but that's less fun and costs $72/CPU/month, so you'd pay $576 for a month of 8-CPU node usage. Mayhap cheaper to buy a 600€ cluster, pay a couple € of electricity per month and get a 100MB internet connection.","1225571973"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Thanks for the comment.  A brief rejoinder:

&gt;I am not against Social Security as long as its voluntary.

I cannot be voluntary however.  If people opt out, there's no income stream and the gov't never kept the money in one huge ""savings account.""  The SS fund is nothing more than an accounting scheme.

&gt;Its government backed and very secure.

The appearance of security comes from (1) the assumption that government = secure; and (2) the fact that government can just take more from people anytime it wants to pay off recipients.  I don't want the ability to opt out just to find myself paying higher taxes because they (inevitably) have shortfalls in the SS system.

Reasonable restrictions should be adopted but outright banning especially in bars pisses me off. When I was a non-smoker I was a bartender. I dealt with it all the time- if there's some ventilation you're just not going to have many problems. In fact except for a few clubs I worked at I never smelled like smoke after work.

The more you obsess about something the more you will notice it. People with asthma bitching that just the smell causes them serious discomfort- I say BS. What about diesel exhaust, perfume (axe makes me ill), wood smoke, etc?

It always seems the loudest complainers suffer from serious halitosis. Of course I may just be obsessing.

Every time you smear your stinky saliva over doorknobs, condiments, retail goods, etc. you risk spreading any bug you have to the elderly, those with compromised immune systems, and children.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

    That old sorcerer has vanished
    And for once has gone away!
    Spirits called by him, now banished,
    My commands shall soon obey.
    Every step and saying
    That he used, I know,
    And with sprites obeying
    My arts I will show.
 
      Flow, flow onward
      Stretches many
      Spare not any
      Water rushing,
      Ever streaming fully downward
      Toward the pool in current gushing.

    Come, old broomstick, you are needed,
    Take these rags and wrap them round you!
    Long my orders you have heeded,
    By my wishes now I've bound you.
    Have two legs and stand,
    And a head for you.
    Run, and in your hand
    Hold a bucket too.

      Flow, flow onward
      Stretches many,
      Spare not any
      Water rushing,
      Ever streaming fully downward
      Toward the pool in current gushing.

    See him, toward the shore he's racing
    There, he's at the stream already,
    Back like lightning he is chasing,
    Pouring water fast and steady.
    Once again he hastens!
    How the water spills,
    How the water basins
    Brimming full he fills!

      Stop now, hear me!
      Ample measure
      Of your treasure
      We have gotten!
      Ah, I see it, dear me, dear me.
      Master's word I have forgotten!

    Ah, the word with which the master
    Makes the broom a broom once more!
    Ah, he runs and fetches faster!
    Be a broomstick as before!
    Ever new the torrents
    That by him are fed,
    Ah, a hundred currents
    Pour upon my head!

      No, no longer
      Can I please him,
      I will seize him!
      That is spiteful!
      My misgivings grow the stronger.
      What a mien, his eyes how frightful!

    Brood of hell, you're not a mortal!
    Shall the entire house go under?
    Over threshold over portal
    Streams of water rush and thunder.
    Broom accurst and mean,
    Who will have his will,
    Stick that you have been,
    Once again stand still!

      Can I never, Broom, appease you?
      I will seize you,
      Hold and whack you,
      And your ancient wood
      I'll sever,
      With a whetted axe I'll crack you.

    He returns, more water dragging!
    Now I'll throw myself upon you!
    Soon, 0 goblin, you'll be sagging.
    Crash! The sharp axe has undone you.
    What a good blow, truly!
    There, he's split, I see.
    Hope now rises newly,
    And my breathing's free.

      Woe betide me!
      Both halves scurry
      In a hurry,
      Rise like towers
      There beside me.
      Help me, help, eternal powers!

    Off they run, till wet and wetter
    Hall and steps immersed are Iying.
    What a flood that naught can fetter!
    Lord and master, hear me crying! -
    Ah, he comes excited.
    Sir, my need is sore.
    Spirits that I've cited
    My commands ignore.

      ""To the lonely
      Corner, broom!
      Hear your doom.
      As a spirit
      When he wills, your master only
      Calls you, then 'tis time to hear it.""

He is a hero because he is taking the fall.

He has jeopardized his legacy and future political ambitions to ensure that Obama wins.

In order for Obama, and the principles of decency and responsibility that once were the bedrock of America, to win, there had to be a solid Republican candidate who could stand against the neoconservative junta.  That man is John McCain.

Since winning the nomination, he has systematically driven what could have been a viable campaign straight into the ground.  Purposefully flip-flopping and picking Ms Palin, an obvious liability.  Appearing weak, confused and uninformed.  He is way smarter than any of that.

The iPhone presented the case that a touchscreen addressed the drawbacks of Blackberries and Treos by making its complete interface future-proof.

An electronic voting machine should have hardware buttons and software designed to work with them; involving fewer design challenges than with a touchscreen and far lower cost.","1225573048"

This definition precludes any kind of reasonable behaviour, such as personal benefit or 'the greater good'.  It even precludes pure sadism and psychopathology; a clinical psychopath does not do 'evil for evil's sake' but merely fails to recognize that others' suffering might outweigh their own immediate needs; and (unhealthy) sadists do not hurt others because they see hurting as 'a good thing', but for the sake of visceral pleasure.  By this definition, an evildoer must do evil for the sake of evil or for no good reason at all.  In my view, this is contrary to the reality of human experience, and thus this 'simulation' of a nonexistent phenomenon is a waste of time and perhaps actively misleading.","1225573053"

A problem I have with the article you posted is I completely disagree with the following:

&gt; Indeed, if Obama had had his way, all American combat troops would have been withdrawn from Iraq by March 2008, which would have led to civil war and genocide; an unprecedented victory for al-Qaeda and Islamic jihadists; and a boon to Iran.
&gt;
&gt; This fact is, by itself, a shattering indictment to Obama's judgement, and in the area that is the most important responsibility of a president: his duties as commander-in-chief. 

The administration's stance has for a while has been when things are going bad: a. things are bad so we must stay or they will get worse **AND** when things improve b. things are good so we must stay or things will get worse.  If the surge worked so well why are the troop levels not lower?  To many people [my self included] the idea of the surge became a way to keep things going as if you were coming and trying new things when in fact it was really more of the same in many ways.

I remember one particular case in which a child was born with a disease that left him with small holes in his brain, which in turn made him incredibly bi-polar from birth. The child would alternate between acting incredibly ""evil"" (as in, torturing himself, pets, and parents with sharp objects, in fact, killing several pets) and going back to a normal child. He would remember committing the acts but never understood why, and it left him in tears as he asked why he did these things.

The reason I'd downvote it is because almost every negative story about him is a variation on a smear that has already been voiced on Fox, screamed about by Hannity, babbled about by Palin, debunked on Factcheck, covered and dismissed on the BBC and then posted on here 12 times by reddit-man. All Fox and right wing ""commentators"" like Drudge, Malkin, Coulter, etc. do is act as the political equivalent of spam. Maybe some of those pills really *will* make my dick bigger, but I'll never know, will I?

That's the real effect these guys have -- they make people legitimately interested in the issues ignore some facts that really might be important, just because they're grouped with all the other bullshit they're blathering on about. Maybe there's a legitimate point about Obama and Ayers  raised in one of these articles, but after evaluating the situation on my own and then STILL seeing Fox gnawing at the cracked, bleeding teat of this ""story"" like a starving piglet, I'm not going to give this non-issue any more credit than it deserves.

But in fact, they are.  During prohibition, they had to amend the Constitution to grant the Federal government the right to regulate alcohol.  Then Congress re-amended the Constitution for that simple activity.

There was a time when people who made an oath to uphold the Constitution respected that oath.

These days, we have jokers voting for bailouts to redistribute wealth to rich fucking bankers.

By the way... this power would not exist were it not for the 16th Amendment.  As originally written, Article 1, Section 8 explicitly says all direct taxes must be apportioned.

Which, in modern English, means, ""If the government is going to take money directly from the people, it must be used in a way that everyone gets the benefit equally.""  You know, like National Defense... everyone pays in... everyone gets the same benefit.

Not this, ""We'll take from everyone and give to a minority.""  

Most people based on some self-proclaimed charitable bent can tolerate that minority being ""poor"" or ""underprivileged"", but almost no one can tolerate that minority being ""rich"" or ""privileged.""

I'm saying that this is a direct transfer of wealth from a majority to a minority, and no matter what, forced transfers of wealth is wrong.

We live in a world of scarcity, and some of our scarce resources go towards your Long Island Railroad.  What goes to your Long Island Railroad cannot also go towards another production line.  A business is unprofitable when it purchases factors of production and then produces something less-valued than those factors themselves, which have prices that reflect all these production uses for them.  Unprofitable businesses do not exist in a void: their 'in the red' accountancy tells them that they've drawn factors of production from higher-valued uses to their lower-valued use.  Your railroad's persistent deficits are evidence of consumers' persistent preference for its resources to go instead to some other endeavor.

So on top of willfully perverting the structure of production away from what people actually want, your local government has corrupted the Long Island Railroad in a real way by piping taxes into it.

They had plans and they had combat ready troops VERY close. It's not like they had to fly to the other side of the globe. That's all I am saying. Yes, you can move 250 tanks very fast if you have them close and if they are ready ... and Russians had them. Explaining is easy ...

I do not owe a debt to the wheat farmer or to the house builder, the wheat and the house were already paid for by myself or my parents. The house builder freely built the house; if there was some other constraint upon him, that is not my debt.

I do not exist merely at the sufferance of ""society"". To claim that everyone has a debt to ""society"" is to claim me as a slave; and because ""society"" is a vague notion that does not exist as a coherent entity, the product of my slavery ends up decided by self-serving legislators selected through an imperfect election of majoritarian rule.

And, if the extent of the ""debt to society"" is too onerous, every such slave can opt out of the work and simply choose to receive the benefits, since ""society"" cannot actually force me to work.

I'm coming to find, and have likely concluded, thanks in part to your comment - that I was totally wrong. I think what I need to do (correct me if I am mistaken here somewhere) is to be somewhat selfish, to write for its own sake and for me alone. Do what Allan Bloom said - ""A philosopher should never look to an audience."" You have helped me immensely.

&gt; It sounds to me like you may be the type of person who puts too much pressure on his / herself over all, probably needlessly.

This is so accurate that it is almost nauseating. You are again right.

&gt; These aren't feelings to be 'fixed' so much as feeling to be felt and understood. [...] The way to get over self-loathing is to accept those feelings while understanding that they're not accurate.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; This isn't my only issue - I mean to take a few posts and use that to determine my political stance is not just lazy, but nearly criminally so

   Minor error in your argument here my friend, in re-reading the last paragraph of my previous post, I simply see no place where I have actually specified that those comments are specifically directed at you, and in fact as I analyze the grammar, it appears that my intent was in fact the opposite, that of not making it personal.  

&gt;you are not bothering with a everyone's responsibility to research my stand

   Everybody's responsibility?  I really do not think so.  Whether you are making arguments for the joy of ""wrestling a pig in the mud"", or you for some reason believe the issues you raise are relevant to the discussion and justify what happened, the arguments you are making are simply noise without content.  

You questioned whether Planned Parenthood would support a CEO who in turn supported an anti-choice candidate. I responded that sometimes equivalent choices are made and gave you an example of such from my own life as an alliteration.  

Suppose that a candidate came along that not only was anti-choice (because of the risks to a woman's health by the procedure) but also proposed that henceforth birth control would be the absolute responsibility of the male gender, by means of surgical sterilization?   Certainly, I can see Planned Parenthood keeping a CEO who supported such a candidate. (Actually not, since Planned Parenthood itself is not a specifically genderized institution, and would probably seek to protect the rights of the males who would be caught by such a proposition as they now seek to pursue the rights of the female population) 

Now you accuse me of attacking you and demand that I make the extraneous effort of finding the spectrum of your views before I have an opinion, Sorry, that also holds nothing.   Last I knew, the discussion was about whether it was appropriate for Dan Cooper to have been asked to step down as CEO of Cooper Arms. Whatever you feel about whatever other issues is not really part of this discussion.  

You make arguments that Dan Cooper's being asked to step down is correct, is this not true?  If it is, I disagree with your perspective on this. If it is not true, you need to consider what arguments you are making since what I and an apparent majority of responders are reading is that you appear to.

We can work together to enact and enforce common-sense laws and improvements – like closing the gun show loophole, improving our background check system, and **reinstating the assault weapons ban**, so that guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I've always found the difference between the Japanese and the Germans post WWII to be very interesting.  To me, the German people and their governments have spent a tremendous amount of time and effort reconciling with the demons of their past.  It is one of the reasons few amongst the even-somewhat-rational at all directly associate modern Germany with their unfortunate past: not only have they been honest about it, they've honestly worked hard to put it behind them.

In contrast, the Japanese seem hard-pressed to even acknowledge anything happened in WWII, let alone reconciling that with their modern nation and national consciousness.  I find that to be disturbing, even though modern Japan is in no way a colonizing power like they once were.  However, without examining their past, many have not come to any sort of grip with the extreme xenophobia in Japanese culture; xenophobia that to me is very reminiscent of the antisemitism that was long rampant in pre-Nazi and Nazi Germany.

That was B-L-D on Saturday, and B only on Sunday.  sausage, eggs, and hashbrowns for breakfast was the typical Saturday fare.   Frozen Sausage patties were about $0.25 ea, eggs about $0.10 ea, and for hash browns, I used tater tots in a frying pan.  We served that meal for well under $0.50 per person, including the cost of the propane for the stove.

I, too would have to know a bit more about exactly what this experiment entails but I'm proceeding from the assumption the definition of evil that the reseacrcher gave is the same one he based his software on.  This definition explicitly states that an evil person either has no reason for their actions, or knows what they're doing is evil but still sees it as a good thing in and of itself to do.  Plenty of people share this view of evil and thus he might not have had too difficult of a time finding grants for his work.

24 hours later, a new motherboard arrived at my apartment door, free of charge, with a free shipping label to send the old motherboard back, instructions for replacement, offers of on-the-phone walkthrough for replacement, an automatic, free extension of my warranty to 1 year, and a promise that personally doing the swap instead of taking it into the shop would not result in a voided warranty.

Well of course it does. That's a no-brainer. The fact, though, is that people can kill in 1,000 different ways. A gun just lets my grandmother kill someone too if she needs to defend herself, while the other options leave her at their mercy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Good story, and well orchestrated. However, having worked at Mcdonald's for quite a long time in the past I can tell you some things you are missing. 

1) Any decent owner/operator or store manager looks at their hourly sales on a *daily* basis. (e.g., Saturday is usually a $900 sales hour at store X from 9am-10am) Your trick would have brought hourly sales way out of variance from the norm (and these numbers usually have fairly low variance unless there is bad weather), and would have been noticed quite quickly by one of the aforementioned. Congratulations on finding a dumb store, however if others of you think it would be that easy, odds are you will not get so lucky. 

2) If you are thinking of robbing a safe, you will most likely get caught, and you will most likely get jail time. There is one manager I know who served 3 years for theft. Here is a big clue to why your idea is not ingenious, depending upon your plan of action. 1) Night-time, there are very few people who have both a key to the store and know the safe combination, thus easy to narrow it down.
2) Working hours, there are only 5-10 employees working, and even if you assumed they all know combo (which prob don't) it is easy to narrow it down based upon the video evidence from the cameras. 
3) Mcdonald's stores are mostly franchises. This means a majority of them are run by small businessmen/businesswomen from the local area.

First of all RIP was never an anti-terrorism bill. It made wide-ranging changes to laws on surveillance, intended for all purposes. Although terrorism is always mentioned when talking about surveillance, this act didn't even have ""terrorism"" in its name, and expressly talks about these powers in terms of any and all investigation of crime of any nature.

This is even more blatant than when the Daily Mail and their ilk claim that any powers granted under the 2001 ""Anti-terrorism, crime and security act"" are ""anti-terror laws"", as though the ""crime"" bit wasn't there either in the name or the contents.

So the claim this is about over-broad use of anti-terror laws is simply crap.

And despite the use of surveillance powers which reddit in general don't like very much, I don't have much sympathy for the people involved here. Compared to what you mostly-USians are used to, we live very closely together in Europe in general, and especially cities in the UK; people refusing to follow rules about things like rubbish, noise and so on can bring enormous misery to those who have to live near them, and since you're not allowed over here to shoot them, you better hope there's some way the law can be involved on your side.

So what happened here? Some people who habitually break the law, because they can't be arsed to follow it and expected never to get caught, got caught and issued with small fines. This was done not by intercepting their phone calls or internet activity, nor by spying on them in any private place, but by watching what they did in a public place and noticing that it was illegal.

However, the other possibility is that the first caveman with a club threatened instead a foreign tribe, and the foreign tribe organized a military defense in order to guard against the club wielder, from which all in their tribe benefit.

Verily, the weakest in the tribe benefit most from the military defense, but there is strength in numbers, and the strongest choose to keep the physically useless for whatever reason, such as their sex or wisdom (both of which are still militarily useful). In that state of nature, though, the physically strong are free to decide to keep the others, not forced to protect them by political manuevering.

Actually, it looks like you mean offensive warfare. Attacking a foreign state to take its wealth is not the same as providing for the defense of your own state against such attacks, and I do not see why it would be immediately relevant to the internal distribution or redistribution of wealth.","1225576047"

"programming","t5_2fwo","First of all, its a thousand commits for x264, not DivX ;)

But on that note, here are really only two active developers for x264 (the main developers: there are some minor ones that maintain only small chunks of the program).  And, for almost three years, there was only one active developer (Loren Merritt).

Secondly, in x264, we have a policy of making ""every commit count""--that is, while we could easily have ten thousand commits at this point simply by making every single typo fix and optimization its own commit, we try to lump things together in logical ways to reduce the number of commits.  This is useful, IMO, because it helps the revision log better serve as a history of development, rather than being cluttered up by dozens of relatively trivial commits.

Generally, this means that features, no matter how small or large, get their own commit.  So a new feature, whether it be a new set of assembly functions or a new algorithm, is almost always a single commit.  Exceptions sometimes do occur in cases where the feature is extremely large (requiring changes to thousands of lines of code), but even then we try to avoid that as well, since generally you can't commit ""half of a feature"" and still have the build still work.","1225576104"

No, racism absolutely *is* 'confined to ethnic boundaries' by its very definition.  Bias based on *race* is the very meaning of the term.  Claiming otherwise is a contradiction and a lie.  

Certain groups espouse this lie to promote their political agendas.  You see, racism is something that pretty much everyone agrees is wrong.  (Racism in its real definition, that is.)  Primary because it is *factually* wrong - there seems to be almost no real basis for claims that any one racial group is superior to another in any significant way - and because these claims are factually wrong, decisions and policies based on them are unjust.  

But there are any number of policies that many people do *not* think wrong - allowing individuals to keep most of the wealth they accumulate rather than redistributing it, for example.  Policies that are not clearly based on inaccurate factual claims.  So certain dishonest individuals and groups, rather than trying to convince people that these policies are wrong - *because they have no convincing arguments for this stance* - instead try to label the policies as 'racist'.

There is of course nothing remotely racist about the policies.  One would have to be very nearly *cognitively impaired* to think there was.  The people who promote these claims, of course, do not believe it themselves.  But by labeling some policy as 'racist', they alleviate the need to convince people that there is actually anything wrong with the policy.  People who try to defend it are called racists.  People who try to explain how the policy is obviously not racist are call racists.  

**Everyone who disagrees gets called a racist.**

It is this anti-intellectual bandwagon you've gotten yourself caught up in.  

And hey, it's somewhat clever - though you probably don't even realize this.  People who are far too stupid to form coherent arguments in favor of the political positions they prefer get to fall back on name-calling.  When their positions are refuted, they name-call some more.  When their name-calling is refuted, they just repeat themselves.  

It's a shame, though.  You're too deluded to understand any of this.  Your little head is so wrapped up in spin that you actually *believe* what you are saying.  

**But here's the problem**:  According to you, everyone who disagrees with you is racist.  This probably makes you feel better about yourself.  

But guess what happens if people start agreeing with you about your special definition of 'racism'.  Most people aren't just going to change their positions.  They're just going to stop caring about racism.  If you succeed in turning 'racism' into this special, all-encompassing term for anything you disagree with, then 'racism' loses the essential component that makes people think it wrong - it is no longer based on factual inaccuracies because it no longer has anything to do with claims of racial difference.

By your special definition of 'racism', then, being 'racist' is fine with most people, because most people don't agree with every single political preference you have.  Even many the most revered warriors for racial equality are 'racists'.  

For this reason, your position is irrational and self-refuting.

"science","t5_mouw","Lets say that the earth were spinning at 99% the speed of light, and that we had a sister planet that was stationary 
and could observe us.  If I'm correct in my understanding, than the people on earth would be seen by the people on the
stationary planet as experiencing a time dilation, and would thus age more slowly.  For the sake of this thought experiment,
lets say that over the course of spinning for 10 years, the people on earth age 1 year compared to the 10 years the people
on the stationary sister planet aged.  

Are we correct so far?

Now lets consider that there is a train on earth capable of travelling at 99% the speed of light.  The train starts moving 
on earth at 99% the speed of light, in the opposite direction that the earth itself is spinning.  To the outside observer,
the train appears stationary.  To the people on earth, the train is moving at 99% the speed of light.

Now here is the question:

To the people on earth, am I not corret to assume that for them the people on the train experience a time dilation and seem
to age more slowly (1 year for every 10 of their years).  

For the people on the stationary sister planet, however, the people on the train are stationary, and therefore are not 
experiencing a time dilation.  To the people on the stationary planet, after ten years, they observe the people on the train 
aging 10 years, and the people on the train aging 1 year. 

So, after ten years of the outside observers time, if everything stopped spinning, would the people on the train be one year
older (as the people on earth would guess), or would they be 10 years older as the people on the stationary planet would suggest?

"programming","t5_2fwo","**Java Performance in 64bit land**  
  
If you were buying a new car and your primary goal was performance, or more specifically raw power - given the choice between a 4 cylinder and a 8 cylinder engine, the choice is obvious. Bigger is better. Generally when we look at computers the same applies, or at least that is how the products are marketed. Thus a 64bit system should out-perform a 32bit system, in the same way that a quad core system should be faster than a dual core.  
  
Of course, what a lot of the world is only starting to understand is that more isn’t always better when it comes to computers. When dealing with multiple CPUs, you’ve got to find something useful for those extra processing units to do. Sometimes your workload is fundamentally single-threaded and you have to let all those other cores sit idle.  
  
The 32bit vs. 64bit distinction is a bit more subtle. The x86-64 architecture adds not only bigger registers to the x86 architecture, but more registers. Generally this translates to better performance in benchmarks (as having more registers allows the compilers to create better machine code). Unfortunately until recently, moving from a 32bit java to a 64bit java mean taking a performance hit.  
  
When we go looking at java performance, there are really 2 areas of the runtime that matter: the JIT and the GC. The job of the JIT is to make the code that is running execute as fast as possible. The GC is designed to take as little time away from the executing of code as possible (while still managing memory). Thus java performance is all about making the JIT generate more optimal code (more registers helps), and reducing the time the GC has to use to mange memory (bigger pointers makes this harder).  
  
J9 was originally designed for 32bit systems and this influenced some of the early decisions we made in the code base. Years earlier I had spent some time with a PowerPC system that ran in 64bit mode trying to get our Smalltalk VM running on it, and had reached the conclusion that the most straight forward solution was simply to make all of the data structures (objects) twice as big to handle the 64bit pointers. With J9 development (circa 2001), one of the first 64bit systems we got our hands on was a Dec Alpha so we applied the straight forward ‘fattening’ solution, allowing a common code base to support both 32bits and 64bits.  
  
A 64bit CPU will have a wide data bus, but recall that this same 64bit CPU can run 32bit code as well and it still has the big wide data bus to move things around with. When we look at our 64bit solution of allowing the data to be twice as big, we’re actually at a disadvantage relative to 32bits on the same hardware. This isn’t a problem unique to J9, or even Java - all 64bit programs need to address this data expansion. It turns out that the dynamics of the java language just tend to make this a more acute problem as java programs tend to be all about creating, and manipulating objects (aka data structures).  
  
The solution to this performance issue is to be smarter about the data structures. This is exactly what we did in the IBM Java6 JDK with the [compressed references feature](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.java.doc.user.lnx.60/user/garbage_compressed_refs.html). We can play tricks (and not get caught) because the user (java programmer) doesn’t know the internal representation of the java objects.  
  
The trade off is that by storing less information in the object, we limit the total amount of memory that can be used by the JVM. This is currently an acceptable solution, as computer memory sizes are nowhere near the full 64bit address range. We only use 32bits to store pointers, and take advantage of 8 byte aligned objects to get a few free bits \[ pointer &lt;&lt; 3 \]. Thus the IBM Java6 JDK using compressed references ([-Xcompressedrefs](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.java.doc.user.lnx.60/user/garbage_compressed_refs.html)) can address up to 32Gb of heap.  
  
We’re not the only ones doing this trick, Oracle/BEA have the [-XXcompressedRefs](http://edocs.bea.com/jrockit/jrdocs/refman/optionXX.html) option and Sun has the [-XX:+UseCompressedOops](http://blog.juma.me.uk/2008/10/14/32-bit-or-64-bit-jvm-how-about-a-hybrid/) option. Of course, each of the vendors implementations are slightly different with different limitations and levels of support.  Primarily you see these flags used in [benchmarking](http://www.spec.org/jbb2005/), but as some of our customers are starting to run into heap size limitations on 32bit operating systems they are looking to move to 64bit systems (but would like to avoid giving up any performance).  
  
There is a [post on the websphere community blog](http://webspherecommunity.blogspot.com/2008/10/64-bit-performance-thoughputmemory.html) that talks about the IBM JDK compressed references and has some pretty graphs showing the benefits. And Billy Newport gives a [nice summary](http://www.devwebsphere.com/devwebsphere/2008/10/websphere-nd-70.html) of why this feature is exciting.

Java is a pathetic language touted as such a great breakthrough. Unfortunately, the competition for Java isn't so great either. I think C# is slightly better than Java but not much. C++ is fine but needlessly complex. C is somewhat ok but it was too weak to hold of C++, and for this reason alone I would love to see C die because it fails to evolve - unfortunately I think C# or Java would profit most from a dying C so C  should never die.

Yeah, you do need a distinct value for deleted values.  `put` would work fine if you just used null - you'd end up overwriting the deleted value like normal.  But `get` would fail - the probe sequence might mistakenly think that the hash slot is empty, when in reality the item was inserted at its alternate location.  You don't need to store the original key - you just need a key that is different from all others, so that it'll never come up as equal to the key that you're searching for.

So that's easy enough to fix - you designate one particular pointer value as Deleted, perhaps pointing to a null HashEntry, and check for that when inserting or searching.  A sentinel, in other words.","1225577316"

Further, these two acts do little more than expand government power.  Those with political connections will have the AG grant them whatever they need and rarely do these anti-trust cases come out to anything more than political witch hunts.

I do, however, dislike the suggestive tone of the phrase ""provided the OP can get over the reluctance to read things on a computer.""

The suggestion is that my preference to have a physical book rather than an online book somehow reflects poorly on me. What in particular creates this impression is the wording ""get over the reluctance."" And, of course, your characterization of a book as a ""dead tree"" also adds to this impression.

On a side note, I can only wonder if you're as environmentally-conscious in every other aspect of your life...or, if you just get a bang out of being self-righteous on reddit under a silly pseudonym. 

Your suggestion is strange to say the least, and, it actually reflects poorly on your intelligence I'd say. There's nothing unreasonable about preferring a physical book in which one can underline passages and make notes and bend the corners of pages back etc.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I've been doing a lot of reading lately about Private Label Rights (PLR) content. I used to think that it was only for lazy people who didn't want to do their own writing. But as I learn more, I've come up with lots of great ways I can use PLR in my own business.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, PLR is content that you get from the original author along with their permission to use it as your own. So you can get a great report, put your name on it and have your own product to sell or give away!  The first couple of products I created using PLR only took me about half an hour. There have been a few sales so far from them so that was definitely time well spent.  When searching for PLR content to use, I found there were a lot of different types of sites available. Some offered monthly memberships and others offered just one time purchases. So be sure to look around before you decide where to buy.  The site I found that was by far the best was PLRWholesaler. Not only do they have an unbelievable amount of content, but it's completely FREE. Most sites charge an arm and a leg for the amount of content that this guy is giving away.  And although I haven't been through everything yet, what I have read is very good quality. It's stuff you would actually want to use as your own.  Since it's free, I highly recommend that you check out PLRWholesaler and see if they have anything that you can use in your business. There just may be an ebook or audio recording that you could quickly brand with your information and start selling to your list.  Check it out and let me know what you think...  http://enoteware.gaborolah.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=SOCIAL1","1225578176"

Obama has put his lawyer army to work and dismantled much of that shady stuff very effectively. People make him out to be naive, but the past has shown the opposite.


If it looks like racism or some other unforseen factor causes him to legitimately lose, he'll likely accept it.

Legit question","1225578265"
"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Well we're talking about two different things here. The conditions that cause the criminal behavior in the first place, and conditions within the prison which may perpetuate or increase violent behavior. I haven't said a word about the former and I only mention the latter because you bring up the Stanford Prison Experiment. I'm not blaming guards at a prison for someone getting themselves into jail. What I'm saying is a prisoner becoming more violent, while in jail, is a direct result of their conditions, because there is no other outside influence. But again, prison reform and the death penalty are not the same issue, although they may be interrelated. 

Let me put this in a different way. In my opinion, the sole function of the justice system is remove dangerous elements from society and rehabilitate them. When rehabilitation isn't possible, then those elements must be contained to prevent innocent people from being harmed. People more qualified than myself can make that judgment. Ok, in extreme cases, when the prisoner cannot be contained, then I will agree with you, there may be grounds for ending their lives. Let's say the police are trying to arrest someone and he pulls out a gun on them. Then yes, it's justified for the police to shoot him. Sometimes there's some moral ambiguity here. We've heard the stories. A guy reaches for his wallet and the police think it's a gun. But for the purpose of argument, let's stick with clear cut cases. It's a threat that must be dealt with.

So ok, you've got a complete psychopath, let's say. He's in jail and it's be recommended that he be moved to solitary confinement. What is the negative effect? What can he do from there where the extra step is necessary to end his life? How much of a threat can someone be when you still have the ability to lead them to an electric chair? 

The thing I object to is people saying, ""He deserves it. I want to see that motherfucker fry!"" Their anger is understandable of course, and totally justified. But I don't think that kind of vengeful thinking should be encouraged. That's where I see the negative effect. Killing a murderer doesn't bring back a loved one. But I fear that it does legitimize the idea that killing someone is ok.","1225578267"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Because this makes it a vote of the state and not of factions within the state. We are, after all, the United States of America.

The most democratic way to elect a president would obviously be to eliminate the electoral college and decide the matter based on the popular vote. Our races tend to be close, so this would result in some being decided by statistical noise, but one can argue it would be at least as fair as the current system, where elections have been decided by very narrow margins, susceptible to voter suppression tactics, in a few key states.

The next most democratic would be for the states to apportion electoral votes based on the popular vote within the state. (The number of electors per state is the number of senators plus representatives.) This would allow candidates from other than the two parties to at least make a showing in the electoral college. In a close race, this approach might allow the race to be decided by rounding. Also, like the US senate, this would disproportionately represent very small states.

Possibly the worst way would be to assign electors based on congressional districts. In many states, like Texas and California, the congressional districts are so gerrymandered the outcome of nearly all congressional elections is known in advance. Nebraska and Maine do it this way, assigning two electors based on the statewide totals and the others based on congressional district outcomes, but these states are so homogeneous the method has had no practical effect.

Real answers, okay:

Political compromise is my basic premise. See, we don't all live in a world of perfect ideals, and sometimes you do things you don't like in order to get stuff done...

I am hardly an isolationist, and frankly we are already embedded in the world at large and have been since WWII. Not a huge fan of unilateral action to line the pockets of corporations, and I would have rather intervened in Darfur than Iraq, but you can't get everything you want in life. Nor can you reign back the military in a single year and put that much of the economy on the ropes. Like it or not, the MIC is a large portion of our economy and it will take years of slow cutbacks and transitions to get them down to size.

Patriot Act/Telecom immunity- yep, he pretty much f'ed that up.

Computing- He has a pretty good tech platform. Not perfect, but nobody else does either out there.

Bailing out financial institutions- Not much pragmatism on reddit right now. There are two issues: 1.) punishing those who caused this, and making sure that they don't profit; 2.) saving the US economy from a second great depression.

Which do you think is more important? If you said 1, then you are an ideological idiot and don't bother reading on. Frankly a couple hundred million in the pockets of some douche-bag exec is small potatoes compared to what is on the line, and this whole Wall Street/Main Street dichotomy is bullshit. Wait 'til Christmas sales fall to record lows, durable goods orders drop to crap, and basically the economy slows down to nothing. Unemployment jumps up a nice healthy number along with crime rates and the accompanying hard drug use, etc... Abandoned houses become derelict little messes.

That is what is on the line. People here don't really understand CDOs, interest swaps, and how mark to market accounting creates defaults on good assets for companies, causing them to fall apart despite healthy operations. People also don't seem to connect the fact that their jobs are on the line too. Think you are truly recession proof? I doubt it. Letting Lehman fall may have felt good, whether you are a populist or a free marketer, but it was a disaster, shaking confidence in the market further and exacerbating the situation.

I could go on, but all this stuff is the obvious high level stuff that is readily available, but, of course, that is what the sheep read, right? If you want to discuss financial covenants and what constitutes MACs and how to properly tranche debt, we can take this offline...","1225578566"

The ONLY thing you might criticize her on is not possibly catching the ""Prime Minister of Quebec"" but it's also possible she thought he was confused of whom he was speaking about (much like one of our state governors vs. our president).  Nailin Pailin and knowing who the fuck Johnny Holliday are bullshit gotcha's.  It's like making fun of a old white guy for not knowing who the fuck Kayne West is.

But beyond that, we have used property rights over things physical (and intellectual) because it benefits society in a practical sense. It is an intangible government construct used to codify previous holdings and to consolidate force.

Ideally, you should own something because you make it useful, but nothing is stopping another from taking it from you. The government provides a positive construct for us. 

If they can do it for property, what else can they do it with?

I guess I'm an intellectual as a free-lance writer (English/History majors), and Wikipedia is only used to entertain myself late night when I'm bored, while I spend 2-3 hours a day reading paper.  You always have to go to the primary source material if you truly have any interest in the subject and would like to form an original thesis.

You think grad students pursuing a PHD or the highest degrees of 'intellectualism' sit clicking through wikipedia documents all day?  They don't.  So, so many documents aren't even digitized yet and can only be accessed in libraries.

You gonna study the Classics by seeing what Wikipedia says about the Peloponnesian War?  Or somehow understand how the style of Dostoevesky or Kerouac works without reading full books?

Have I written a paper before just using Wikipedia?  Sure, and it was a shitty undergraduate history/research paper that got a good grade.  But me being lazy enough to read a few sites and come up with a nifty thesis isn't 'full-on intellectualism'.

&gt;The Humanitarian Program comprises an offshore component for the resettlement of people overseas, and an onshore component for those people already in Australia who seek Australia's protection...In 2007–08 a total of 13 014 visas were granted, of which 10 799 visas were granted under the offshore component and 2215 visas were granted under the onshore component.

Papal infallibility is not a claim that popes are never wrong, nor even that they they lead good lives.  Such a claim would be rightly be ridiculed as clearly inconsistent with history.


Papal infallibility refers to Catholic Church's long held understanding that the Church's Magesterium  in fulfilling the commission of Christ will be preserved from error in its dogmatic teaching to the universal church on matters of faith and morals.


The definition of the dogma of 1870 at the First Vatican Council stated definitively how this applies to the Pope in his role of pastor to all Christians by virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority -- i.e., he is the successor of the head of the Apostles (Peter).


Probably the fastest way to wrap your mind around this sort of thing is to ask yourself who decided what books belonged in the New Testament.  Many texts were circulated in the first 4 centuries after Christ that people claimed were divinely inspired.  The issue was not settled until the Councils of Hippo (AD 393), Carthage (AD 397), and Carthage again (AD 415) all promulgated the same list of 27 books and sent it to the pope for his ratification.

For 1600 years that decision has been considered closed and done -- closed by the Pope's approval of the Cannon.

&gt; We have enough trouble providing a police force to service our own country effectively.

There are improvements we can make to our (Australian) police force. Some requiring no resources at all. However, in the present form they are functioning at a high level.

At a level high enough such that if a group of people kidnapped you, threw you down a well with a hand grenade, you'd expect a thorough investigation. An investigation with a very good chance of those responsible being caught. Due to this good chance, further, there is a strong deterrent for this crime being committed in the first place.

Unlike in Afghanistan.

&gt; Providing such a service [global police force and global military] seems over the top unrealistic. Shouldn't we be starting small and focusing on where our resources can do the most good for the most people? E.g. finding solutions for poverty

Finding solutions for poverty is not starting small. That is a grand, and laudable aim. Luckily the solutions for poverty have been found. Eg [The Millennium Development Goals](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals) All that is lacking is the political will to implement them. For example, by people in developed countries requiring, as a condition of their vote, a politician to boast Foreign Aid to 1% of Gross National Income.

Providing a global UN military and global police force would *save* australia money. You set up a global system of military tax. That is, you tax a country 60% of it's annual (native) military budget.

If countries want to spend more on their native military (eg the US) then that'd be fine: more money is raised for the UN military and police. If countries want to less on their native military budget because a global, enforced, judicial system exists, then that'd be fine too. Indeed most countries would go with this second option placing an automatic pressure on reducing the global amount spent on military resources.

&gt; As to the idea of open borders ...a country has to first protect its economy, its citizens and its ideals.

Shouldn't some of our ideals be: that everyone is free from political prosecution, that everyone has some minimum level of access to material resources to have a good life?

Might not an economy be better served when all individuals have a enough such that there is no strong economic motive to one country over another?

You think you're the only one to have thought about betting on the election outcome?  There's a billion people already betting on obama or mccain to win through the Intrade stock betting system.

Go put your money where your mouth is.  A share of McCain to win currently costs $16.3 and a share of Obama to win currently costs $83.9.  If you're so sure that McCain is gonna win, then go ahead and buy 50 shares of McCain for $815 now, and you'll win a boat load of money if you're right.

You'd make $83.7 on every share you bought.  So if you buy 50 shares of McCain for $815, then you'll earn $4185 after the election!

Nope. The stinger missiles undid russia. They don't have stingers now so the country is still occupied.

Nope. The smallest effective arm in afghanistan is the rocket propelled grenade and the mortar.

Rifles have been completely ineffective.

While OO is not the only programming paradigm of the day it definately is the most prevalent in business programming.  In python you can ""cheat"" and use a large mix of different paradigms, but in order to do anything well in java you can't.  

Second, this has already been said by many people but bears repeating: THERE ARE MORE JOBS FOR JAVA.  Not by a few, not generally, EVERYWHERE there are more jobs.  

Third, knowing java makes it a lot easier to transition into other C based languages like C, C++, or C#.  

And finally, its never a bad idea to learn another language.  Learning new languages gives you a different way of thinking about the same problems that makes you a better programming general. ","1225580443"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; There are different principles at play. For instance, reddit.com sucks now, because the sub-culture that used to dominate has been overrun by something different.

Precisely because a wider audience brings lost focus. Discussing politics with competent programmers can be fruitful, as you've got common ground and mutual respect. But doing such with someone who created an account just to be a blowhard in the politics subreddit is a waste of time.

&gt; When someone is mature and intellectully ready, they can do this, learning, and coming out with information that they can apply to help improve their life and the societal conditions that could lead to such a monster existing.

You're focusing on only one use of anonymity. I'm not familiar with .onion sites, so I don't know if most of them have the audience you're talking about. I certainly don't see tor as a playground for such things, but as a much wider general anonymity tool. I'm much more interested in making it easy for a whistleblower to step forward than encouraging a serial killer to speak.

While I'm receptive to the idea that exposing everybody to anonymously hosted sites may cause a backlash against anonymity technology, it has to happen sometime. If the design of tor isn't strong enough to withstand governments trying to outlaw anonymity, then the quicker that's fixed, the better.

Anonymity is necessary for *everyone*, not just the select few who devote the time to set it up. Over the past decade we've seen ever increasing oppression of freedom of speech, from governments and their ignorant populaces. Only by getting empowering privacy technology into the hands of everyone will society realize that freedom of speech is an absolute right.

It's a useless amendment. small arms will do no such thing.

You should ask the palestenians about how well arms work against tyranny.

My thinking goes like this...

1) Small arms are useless to entrust your freedoms from the evil gubmit.

2) No set of americans care less about rights than the gun owners. Gun owners only care about guns and no other right.  

3) Americans have been losing very important rights like Habeas Corpus and gun owners haven't done a thing to stop it let alone used their guns.

4) Gun owners are by and large racist and will not stop the stripping of rights from unpopular minorities such as muslims, gays, blacks etc.

5) If asked to most gun owners would volunteer to round up fellow americans. See the wingnuts patrolling the mexican border for an example.

&gt;If you think our governmental officials are so trustworthy, why even bother voting?

I trust the evil gubmit more than I trust the NRA and the gun owners.

I will first assume that, as a straight male, a 2 girl and a guy threesome is preferable to 2 guys and a girl. 

On the other hand, high-fiving a girl is just not the same as high-fiving a guy. Girls don't put enough force into it, and you have to lessen your force with the girl. Guys are better at girls at high-fives, this is just a fact. 

Of course, on a similar note, black guys are better at high-fives than white guys. Their handshakes are like syncopated drum beat, full of all sorts of snaps, pops, time changes and varied angles. Some even balance on the delicate border between hand shakes and high fives, the untrained hand not sure of what is happening. White guy high fives are like an AC/DC drum beat.

"politics","t5_2cneq","...and you know that how? Well let's see what the Democrats thought of Iraq:

&gt;""One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line."" --President Bill Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998

&gt;""If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program."" --President Bill Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998

&gt;""Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face."" --Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998

&gt;""He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983."" --Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998

&gt;""[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs."" Letter to President Clinton, signed by: -- Democratic Senators Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others, Oct. 9, 1998

&gt;""Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process."" -Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998

&gt;""Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies."" -- Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999

&gt;""There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies."" Letter to President Bush, Signed by: -- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), and others, Dec 5, 2001

&gt;""We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them."" -- Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002

&gt;""We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country."" -- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002

&gt;""Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power."" -- Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002

&gt;""We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction."" -- Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002

&gt;""The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons..."" -- Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002

&gt;""I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security."" -- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002

&gt;""There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years ... We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction."" -- Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002

&gt;""He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do"" -- Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002

&gt;""In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members ... It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons."" -- Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002

&gt;""We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction."" -- Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002

&gt;""Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real..."" -- Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003

"programming","t5_2fwo","If you don't have the option to pick another high-demand language (C and C# come highly recommended, but C++ can cause some brain damage), learn Java.  Just remember that Java is almost entirely unlike Python, and one should not attempt to write code for one language in the other.  I got frustrated with Java, and I still wrestle with it when I must use it.  

However, unlike Python, in Java (or any of the other languages I suggested there), you're going to want a good IDE.  If you've got the money, IntelliJ makes a good Java IDE--but they do charge.  Sun's got NetBeans, and there's always Eclipse, and we won't touch the flame war between the two.  If you're on a Mac, Xcode is your friend: it covers C, C++, Objective C, and Java.  If you're particularly interested in Windows development, you'd be better advised to learn C#.  There are cost-free versions of Visual Studio you can get from Microsoft.  If Linux and the various Unixen are your targets, consider either KDE's development suite or Anjunta.  

Always be willing to learn a new language.  After the aforementioned languages, here are my suggestions:

1. Haskell: the favorite of the Proggit snobs.  I recently gave it a test drive, and it was awesome.  That said, I tend to prefer dynamic (duck) typing systems, as they're more suited to my style.
2. Scheme: everybody says the Lisps are dying.  This is patently wrong.  Even if you never use it in a production project, it will make you a better programmer.
3. Smalltalk: It's an object-oriented language, but completely unlike Java/C++/C#/everything else (except Objective C, which grafts Smalltalk onto C in a rather interesting way).
4. Assembly (not descended from Intel's 8086 architecture): RISC assemblies are not too insane, but after just a little bit, you'll be begging for a language with proper loops again.  ","1225580846"

It was an utter mess and one of the worst-written standards of all time, filled with hundreds of pages of stuff nobody would ever use (literally).  But the ""Simple Profile"" and ""Advanced Simple Profile"" were not too bad, and so were adopted as relatively standardized video formats.  Xvid and DivX both implement ASP.  ASP's differences from SP are allowing B-frames, GMC, and Qpel as options; DivX's hardware compatibility spec doesn't allow the latter two because they vastly increase the required complexity of a hardware decoder.

Now, so you ask, what's the story with H.26X?   H.26X are ITU-T standards; the ITU is a division of the United Nations that deals with various standards documents and organizations.  H.261 is basically MPEG-1 Video, H.262 is basically MPEG-2 Video, H.263 is basically MPEG-4 Part 2 SP, and H.264 is basically MPEG-4 Part 10 video, also known as AVC, or ""Advanced Video Coding"".

H.264 was developed in ~1999-2003 to replace both the rather terribly designed MPEG-4 Part 2 series of formats and the incredibly dated MPEG-2 that was still the standard for digital television.","1225580978"

To say that ""only in a free market is everyone on equal footing"" is a complete and utter lie. Everyone is afforded the same basic framework of possibilities, but to say that only in free markets are everyone afforded equal opportunities is PRACTICALLY not true. We need only to look at the media, telecom, pharmaceutical, oil and natural gas to see that you are NOT free to enter those markets. 

Freedom is afforded only to those with the money to buy it.

I absolutely believe that. Gun owners are single minded zealots who are supremely easy to manipulate. Their core value is that might makes right and as a general rule worship strenght and authority. Their fetish is that guns give them strength and authority.

Of course they realize that they don't really have supreme authority because the state has that so they fantasize about taking down the state while secretly wishing the state would give them the authority they want so badly.

""The main argument you'll hear in support of our steeply ""progressive"" income tax scheme is ""the rich should pay more, because they earn more."" I agree. But the top 5% of all wage earners garnered 36% of all income in 2005. Meanwhile, this group paid for 60% of all the taxes. In other words, high wage earners pay far more than their ""fair share"" based on their income.""

So, the top 5% earn 36% of all income, but pay 60% of all taxes.

Face it, most will never risk to start a business, or work hard enough to rise in business, and they don't pay much in taxes as a result.

I really enjoy [Mony Mony]9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6CGImyYNTs) by Billy Idol. Not a complicated song, but it never fails to lift me out of the doldrums when I feel shitty.

my favorite song that is excellent in terms of composition and lyrics is [Tom Sawyer]9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBTvSlhXgiI)

I really love [Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvP0uwl3Q6A). There is not a better band to drink to than these guys, nor is there a better song than this. The opening is great, the drummer's restraint when it comes to symbols rocks, and the solo is great.

I enjoy the Genre bending of [Mr bungle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOtoq6h5cQ). This is a great song, but there are many more by them.

In terms of sensory overload, there's [Orthrelm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fsjBVDLPz8) or [Lightning Bolt]9http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKsg6RNhMGo)

You are creating straw-men arguments. There are very few no bid contracts, but very many wealthy people who never participate in them.

Poor people usually don't take advantage of education opportunities that are available to them that would help them out of their situation.

Most people go home after work, watch tv, maybe have sex and go to bed. They do nothing to change their situation.

The top 5% of wage earners (as of 2005) earned 36% of the income, but paid 60% of the taxes. The bottom 50% of wage earners accounted for only 3% of all taxes paid.

SO, the bottom 50% are basically getting a free ride for all roads, bridges, and all other federally subsidized buildings and programs.

Though I think your point may have been that for all practical purposes an employee can't escape to go vote due to their duties at work. There are a few simple remedies for those in states that allow time off to vote. First, let your employer know that you intend to vote on election day so they can anticipate it. Second, vote early if possible. Third, if they refuse to follow the law, be prepared to take action to enforce it.
In those states that don't allow time off to vote you could prepare for the 2012 election by pressuring your state senators and representatives to address it.

"science","t5_mouw","Facts are a documentation of what we know so far, but hypothesis is what drives science forward.  A hypothesis is essentially a presupposition that can be proven wrong.  

If you think of spiritual belief as a hypothesis for the what science hasn't explained yet, then no conflict arises until religion rejects something definitively proven by science.  This happens all the time with fundamentalists, but apparently the Pope acknowledges that scientific proof trumps literal belief in biblical stories.  He is essentially saying that he believes religion *is* amenable to change and *can* adapt to new facts.  

It seems to me that if religion is able to acknowledge, accept, and even assimilate new scientific facts, there are two possible ultimate outcomes: 

* science will whittle away at religion until it is completely disproven, OR 
* religious beliefs will be revised and clarified until a point is discovered where religion and science meet.  

As science uncovers more and more facts, the mythology of religion may be disproven but the underlying principles--being essentially philosophical--may remain intact.  

Perhaps science will not ultimately disprove religion, but will in fact scour out all the fables, hierarchy, doctrine, dictates, assumptions, etc. that it's tangled with, and arrive at some fundamental truths that are both spiritual *and* scientific.  Religion will have to look and feel vastly different by that point, but the Pope's acknowledgment is a step in that direction, as opposed to the stalemate/regression created by the ""science is a trick of the devil"" fundamentalists.

I can see how you all are caught up in his fancy speeches of ""hope"" after 8 years of Bush screwing us all.   Hope is a very powerful topic and if someone can make you believe in it you'll overlook who that person really is and never consider what he will actually do once in office.  If you disregard Obama's election speeches and only looked at his past record your opinion would be different.  Just look at how many times Obama has lied to us during this election season.

Also if he really wanted to unite the country or at least the Democratic party he would have chosen Hillary over Biden.  He chose Biden because he didn't want anyone to overshadow him and his rise to power.  That's the only reason he selected that idiot.

As I mentioned if you look at Obama's voting history you will see that you are in for a world of disappointment.   The vote on the bailout is a good example.  What a scam on us, the American people.  How could he vote for a bill to ease the credit crisis but not ensure the banks actually loan the money out?  Don't try the argument that ""but everyone else voted for it"".  It Obama was really looking out for us he wouldn't have voted for that.

"politics","t5_2cneq","They had a full page picture of a four winged fruit fly in my high school biology book when I was growing up.  They said this is an example of a mutation from irradiating fruit flies.  It sounded reasonable to me when I was younger.  In my little brain I thought, ""Oh so this is how mutations and evolutionary changes could happen.""  What they didn't tell me was that he couldn't fly, he couldn't mate with other females because they rejected him and he couldn't pass on the four winged trait.  He in fact was damaged goods.  There was no new genetic information, no new species, just a radiation damaged fruit fly. 

Now that I am older and know this, I feel betrayed.  It turns out they have done this to zillions upon zillions of generations of fruit flies in the lab and they have never gotten a beneficial mutation or a different species.  Sounds sorta like Governor Palin is right.  They are wasting money on Drosophila melanogaster research and using the research to mislead kids about evolution.  All they ever get are fruit flies with damaged genetic information.  Nothing new, no new species, nothing.  It is empty research.  They will loudly proclaim they have a new species or something but if you dig deep, it is so much hot air..all they have are fruit flies.  All of the other evidence they taught me about evolution was also this way.

If you really want to look into this subject, start with the book ""Icon's of Evolution"" by Jonathan Wells and also check out this vid.

I would challenge you, if you give Icons of Evolution an honest read, I doubt you will be able to look at Evolution the same again.  I am aware of the criticism of the book but read it for yourself instead of relying on what others say.  Dig a little deeper.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","One of the most important concepts in criminal law is the idea of ""culpable mental states"".  There are four main states: clear intent to harm, knowingly allowing, recklessness, and criminal negligence.  


it is very difficult to accuse a cop of possessing any of these culpable mental states, which is absolutely necessary to convict someone of a crime.


for instance, if I push a button, and three houses away you die from some trap, your unfortunate family cannot accuse me manslaughter because I had no actual intent or negligence of what was going to happen.  if the button clearly showed that it caused dangerous action ""A"" and i still push it, i can be accused.


the idea here is that cops are not negligent and do not intend to commit criminal acts.  whether you believe that is another discussion, but *mens rea* is JUST AS IMPORTANT as *actus rea* in criminal justice, and this is unanimously agreed to be a good thing.","1225584136"

Wouldn't all of Microsofts antitrust suits serve as a sort of precedent to at least encourage companies to go after Apple for the same practises. 

And to some degree I would say that Apple is worse, in that they actively try to prohibit companies or developers from creating something that would compete with their own products.

Whereas I believe Microsoft would just develop something similar to their competitors, and then preload it into their software packages. Where it would be up to the consumer to decide whether to use what was already there or to go out of their way to download/install something else.

Here's a transcript of the preceding portion of the speech, for context:

&gt; Just as we must value and encourage military service across our society, we must honor and expand other opportunities to serve. Because the future of our nation depends on the soldier at Fort Carson, but it also depends on the teacher in East LA, or the nurse in Appalachia, the after-school worker in New Orleans, the Peace Corps volunteer in Africa, the Foreign Service officer in Indonesia. . . . Today, AmeriCorps – our nation’s network of local, state and national service programs – has 75,000 slots. And I know firsthand the quality of these programs.  . . .

&gt; That’s why as President, I will expand AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots, and make that increased service a vehicle to meet national goals like providing health care and education, saving our planet and restoring our standing in the world, so that citizens see their efforts connected to a common purpose. People of all ages, stations, and skills will be asked to serve. Because when it comes to the challenges we face, the American people are not the problem – they are the answer.

&gt; So we are going to send more college graduates to teach and mentor our young people. We’ll call on Americans to join an Energy Corps to conduct renewable energy and environmental cleanup projects in their neighborhoods all across the country. We will enlist our veterans to find jobs and support for other vets, to be there for our military families. And we’re going to grow our Foreign Service, open consulates that have been shuttered, and double the size of Peace Corps by 2011 to renew our diplomacy.

&gt; *We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.*","1225584376"

&gt; What has changed in [the last 40 years] is the way the market has distributed wealth.

Jacob Weisberg, Slate editor-in-chief and intellectual elitist, is, by any objective assessment, retarded. The above quote epitomizes the low level static analysis that pervades liberal economic reasoning.

The market does not distribute wealth-it creates it. Any transaction in the marketplace is an exchange between people with different subjective valuations of the goods or services they are trading. Not only does free market capitalism allow for a society's capital to be used efficiently and grown, it allows trades to be made that maximize the utility of the people.

I understand if people hate Bush and Obama has succeeded in equating him with McCain, but please do not delude yourself into thinking that redistributive economic policies will not slow economic growth. Take a few moments to understand conservative economics, also known as economics.","1225584519"

"programming","t5_2fwo","The state transition function of an NFA takes as input a single input state, and outputs a _set_ of next states (that's the nondeterministic part--the FA can choose to go to any of the states in the output set). The set of next states can be the null set, in which case this execution of the FA ""dies"" and we don't accept the current input string (for this execution path).

A DFA's state transition function takes as input a single input state, and outputs a single (and only single) next state. Alternatively, we can also allow the DFA to output no next state--this is the same as having the DFA transition to an implicit dead state that doesn't accept the input.

Looking at the NFA on the left of the page, we can see that it's nondeterministic because we can transition from the start state to two different states if the first symbol in the input string is b. In other words, there's more than one b arrow coming out of the first state.

The FA on the right is deterministic because there's exactly one a arrow and one b arrow coming out of every state. Some states are missing a arrows or b arrows, but you can think all of those missing arrows pointing to an implicit dead state which self-loops and never accepts the input from there on out.

Since every DFA is an NFA in which every state transition function outputs 0 or 1 next states, it follows that no reduced DFA has less states than a reduced NFA that accepts the same language.

What I'm trying to say is that a free market is not possible within the framework of a political state.

An oft-cited guideline is to ask yourself the question ``is this an exceptional (or unexpected) situation?'' This guideline has an attractive ring to it, but is usually a mistake. The problem is that one person's ``exceptional'' is another's ``expected'': when you really look at the terms carefully, the distinction evaporates and you're left with no guideline. After all, if you check for an error condition, then in some sense you expect it to happen, or the check is wasted code.

The next president does have all of that on his plate and then some.  The points of conduct during a campaign that I raised are very much indicitive of how he would conduct himself as president, and they are also directly going to affect how he is *able* to conduct himself as president.

We're not talking about someone getting caught having an affair on his wife here.  We're talking about (as I said) someone who has executed a campaign that has stirred up some of the most violent and disgusting elements of our culture to the point that they are threating the life of the opposing candidate. 

To a degree, the reputation of our president both domestically and internationally is important.  It's not inconsequential after the campaigns, and it does affect his ability later.

So we agree in that.  I think that where we are disagreeing is that you are viewing the damage done by the McCain campaign as a slight blemish that would be no more than a memory were he elected, and I am viewing it as serious, divisive and dangerous.  

The world is watching us right now.

The next president is not going to be able to do half of what you are asking without being able to effectively engage with the congress.  Attacking half of that congress during your presidential campaign is not a good place to start from.  Indirectly implying and convincing your base that one member of that congress is an anti-american terrorist/communist is also not a good spot to start from.  At the end of this, the loser is still a senator.

As to your final question ""Is there a comparison between the damage done by the memory of a disreputable campaign and the damage done by a President who fucks these things up?""

You lack an imagination. So, did you dig a little deeper? Like say the 30 or so years Jerry Coyne worked on Drosophila? I'm not in his league but I've spent over 20 years working and always learning in molecular biology. When did you stop? I'd say pretty soon after that highschool textbook episode by the fact that you're taken in by Jonathan Wells. 

define whatyou're talking about: """"they have never gotten a beneficial mutation or a different species.""""
For one thing, I suspect you have no idea what those two things actually mean. I mutated fruit flies and one thing I selected for was alcohol tolerance (it's a long story). Within a few generations I had bottles of flies with high ethanol tolerance == beneficial mutation if you're in a high alcohol environment. 

Species is a human concept. You say that like you expect a Drosophila to lay chicken eggs or something. However, you might like to read up on [Richard Lenski’s E. coli experiments](http://myxo.css.msu.edu/index.html) where he did exactly as you suggest: raised E. coli in a  lab for zillions of generations and at the end of it got [(a) beneficial mutation to metabolise citrate and (b) as E. coli can't metabolise citrate it's a new species.](http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/06/02/a_new_step_in_evolution.php)

These are all old well-debunked creationist canards, that no level of evidence or rational thought or argument seem to be able to get through to the wilfully ignorant who keep bringing them up.

If you really want to look into the subject as you suggest, it might be better to start with a better source than the Discovery Institute and dig a little deeper yourself. or you could just keep going to church and stop lecturing people on science which you obviously know nothing about.  

Besides which, have you read the article linked? Do you understand, even if you don't believe in evolution, that that's not what it's about?

It allows people to travel to and from the city without the need for a car(and dealing with the already terrible traffic) and without the need for spending large sums of money. It takes thousands and thousands of cars off the road as a side benefit. 

I partially understand your argument(I am just beginning to get into the nitty gritty of economics, so bear with me) but if I understand you correctly, you are saying that the government is subsidizing an unprofitable structure which takes resources away from another, possibly profitable endeavor(if my interpretation is not correct, please tell me). Which is 100% true. But I don't understand your reasoning behind willfully perverting the structure of production *away* from what people actually want. In my understanding, people want a relatively cheap, efficient, fast method of commuting to and from the nearest job center(NYC). I don't understand how removing that subsidy would help people, let alone allow them to have what they want. It seems removing the subsidy would be against the interests of the commuter, and would hurt more than it would help. 

I understand the theoretical implications of subsidies and government intervention, and I understand how the free market is supposed to be a better alternative, but in certain situations in the real world, ""perverting"" the means of production can help more people by providing a necessary service to more people and making it more accessible to those below a certain pay grade. 

Removal of the subsidies would, as I said before, create a situation where tickets are $40 or more, with many trains being taken off the line(and therefore, packing an uncomfortable amount of people on each train), and many people being laid off in order to maintain a business that operates in the black. A significant portion of people would simply not be able to afford this, and would use much less efficient means of travel. ","1225585800"

what could he have possibly been doing while photographing to warrant this?

occam's razor says he wasn't doing anything illegal and the fact that the filth asked him for a license weighs heavily in that respect.

i had a similar issue with a manager of a supermarket in the uk.  he asked me if i had gotten permission and i asked him, ""from whom?"" and his eyes watered and he said, ""from me.""  the absurdity of the situation diffused it immediately, but there seem to be quite a few british people who's arbitrary laws of conduct supersede the law of the land.

Tell these guys to read the opinion. Only the criteria for the grant of a software patent has changed. The court did not rule that software is not patentable.

The title to this thread ""State Street Overruled...PERIOD"" is simply inaccurate .

Gene Quinn admitted in an October 31 post of his own;

""Was the ""death to software patents"" title over the top? Probably. I do feel that is what the net result will be, but it is not directly because of Bilski. I just think Bilski plus the other various recent cases (i.e., specifically KSR and Nujiten) together will create an environment where software cannot be protect at all.""

To quote another poster who I agree with,

""State Street is specifically NOT overruled. Requiring more than ""useful, concrete, and tangible"" does not automatically make State Street obsolete. The logic used can go both ways. Let's think about the second prong - ""transforms a particular article into a different state or thing."" If some thing has been changed by software (tied to a machine or not) and results in something useful, concrete and tangible, the question becomes is this useful, concrete and tangible something different than before the software operated? Was there a transformation? In fact, the useful, concrete and tangible avenues are all possible roads to show a transformation has occurred. State Street is very much alive.""

It could be a couple of coincidental design choices, or it could be a gang-related drawing. It's really tough to make that call over the internet. But the teacher should be able to make an educated guess on that after spending some time with this kid. 

And even then, if she  **did** suspect him of gang activity, I would think there is a better way to go about the subject than throwing him in the principal's office or whatever.

If the kid truly knew nothing about gangs, I think it would be pretty evident after a few questions. The kid would think nothing of it and just go about their day. No need for psychological evaluation. ","1225586213"

Brazil has very extreme gun control laws. You are allowed certain types of guns but you have to keep it in your house and never on your person. The caliber and type of gun you can own is very limited.

Most people who want a gun for legal purposes (To keep in their home) buy them on the black market because it is much cheaper and easier to get. This has caused the black market to explode and it is huge. The market for legal guns is pretty much nonexistent. 

In São Paulo most businessmen drive in bullet proof cars. Everyday tons of people are robbed, kidnapped, murdered. Car Jackings at gunpoint at a stoplight is common. Many people are getting GPS chips implanted in case they are kidnapped.

Buying a gun on the black market to them is the equivalent of torrenting a movie or buying weed. Sure it is illegal but it is something everyone does, not just evil criminals. ","1225586337"

"science","t5_mouw","Ah, forgive me it it appeared otherwise, but I certainly think that science and spirituality can coexist, in fact, I think, to some degree, they must (they both pertain to pushing the boundaries of ones knowledge, one of that which is external to ones mind, one internal... with obvious areas overlaping depending upon how one choses to see oneself in the world). However,  that is not the same as religion. A religion can't truly be seen as a scientific hypothesis, as a hypothesis, at least in science, must be able to be tested. If we are to make up hypotheses which cannot be tested and do not have to square with current known facts, then our only limit is our imagination as we would have no way of determining between the different 'hypotheses', in this case, religions. In fact, to use the word hypothesis in this manner is to muddle the terminology of the two bodies of thought, it has no real place in religion per se, especially not catholicism. Catholicism has dogma, not hypotheses. Regardless, even if a particular religion was spot on, we could never know under this model. Also, we must recognize that religion is very intelligently designed (or evolved mimetically) to allow each ""believer"" to decide what the 'underlying principles' are for themselves. A case in point is whether homosexuality is a sin, or whether it is something to be forgiven under christianity. Both can be argued, suggesting that the religion itself has no underlying principle, yet allows its follower to believe they understand an 'underlying principle'. I would suggest that it almost appears as a survival mechanism for such a complex body of ideas, as the complex philosophies which could be shown to have fixed ideals generally would be out competed by those philosophies which adapted to each petty individual mind it encountered... from a social memetic point of view it simply a reiterance of the selfish gene. The meme does not need to cary anything other than it's own survival, regardless of the organism within which it lives. In fact, that is what I would suggest the pope is doing (on some level, not necessarily consciously) here, allowing the meme of catholicism to coexist with science... for now. This is to be expected for the survival of the whole memetic concept of catholicism, if it's not going to go the way of the Delphic oracle and become a historical/anthropological footnote (as, of course, most religions have). 

Anyway, I certainly agree it (the pope saying this) is a positive development. In order to not fall into the same trap as religion, I must admit that I don't have all facts to hand, so could be horribly wrong (Shiva may yet rent the sky asunder to laugh at my mortal foolishness)... However, I can say, given all facts reasonably available at this moment in time, that historically the religions have proved to be woefully inadequate when it comes to describing the physical universe we live in, but then again, that is to be expected as they were not evolving for any absolute truth, but rather what appeals to us as humans (i.e. immortality, a just universe etc etc). Basically adapting to the memetic mind space of man. This in turn summons the whole of evolutionary psychology which is an entire lifetime study on it's own, as well as the fact that the whole process of life/existence is fundamentally infinite given it's chaotic nature.  We don't have the tools to break open that ol' chestnut...... yet.... Still, I ramble on again, and, given the number of down votes I'm already receiving I think I'll leave this subject be. 

Still, I certainly see you point(s), but must respectfully disagree.

As much as I prefer dead tree (and I just like to call it that for kicks and have yet to come across anyone actually using that in an environmentally-conscious way since there really is no nice way of determining whether or not dead tree is actually bad for the environment compared to producing devices like a Kindle and distributing books online), given I have a physical library consisting of probably thousands of books by now, some texts can greatly benefit from an online edition and that includes tech books.

Why? Because paper books become outdated quickly, and they often times contain many errors. It becomes a lot simpler to get all the same books via something like Safari Books Online because you can get the newest edition with errata and copy+paste-able code. I cannot even begin to count how many outdated tech books I have. Half my dead tree tech book collection must have a corresponding newer edition to go with it, and I *still* get the book in some kind of electronic form for the convenience of all the above plus searching and highlighting and making notes and more. Just off the top of my head I know I have two editions of Cocoa Programming for OS X and three separate editions of About Face. And there's a Visual Basic 6 book and something about Java 1.3...I should really go recycle those someday. Outdated books can teach you some things, but when it comes to things like learning a new language, they can be more harmful and time-wasting than not. Even among some of the not-outdated books, some will be a complete waste of your time and others will inspire you to do more. Most of them will be somewhere inbetween, and they'll suck at one thing while being an excellent resource for another. Which is another reason why I suggested Safari.

If you can't decide on a book but want more than one..Safari is $20-50/month depending on which subscription you choose. That is easily the cost of one book that you can sample 10 or more books for. Plus, if you really need to get a paper copy of the book, Safari can also get you a sometimes fairly decent discount. And of course, the more expensive subscription includes rough cuts, which are beta versions of a book which can be extremely useful to have when you want to take a peek at a book about some fairly new technology not yet ready for publishing for a few more weeks or months or more.

I don't know where you got the impression you did from my comment, but I'm not environmentally-conscious to that point, I never meant to say anything derogatory towards your preference to have a physical book, since I too share such a preference but believe that there can be a balance between the two for the benefits each provides (well, for me, until there's a device better than the Kindle and the iPhone for reading books). I am just suggesting an option you may find more cost-effective and useful in your quest to learn PHP.

and I might point out dlsspy's suggestion to your comment below is a valid one. I've personally found that the best way to learn a new language is to think of something I'd like to do then get down and dirty with implementing it. You *will* be spending a lot of time sitting and reading at a computer, and if you do have eyestrain reading tutorials online, you best be figuring out ways to prevent that now (taking breaks frequently, setting up your work environment comfortably).","1225586542"

Tip #2 - Take care of it on Monday, Nov 3rd, in person at the office that handles voter registrations.  Don't leave until they tell you explicitly yes, you are registered, or no you are not.  If you are registered, have a GREAT Tuesday, and cast your ballot.  If not, find out the procedures for casting a provisional ballot.  You cast your vote, and it is counted after the board of elections figures out why you were not on the rolls in the first place.

If you are not on the rolls, prepare to raise hell with the local media and all of your elected officials.  Your provisional ballot is all well and good, but holding their toes to the fire by making sure that others are aware of your dilemma might be a necessary step.

"programming","t5_2fwo","No, there is only one ""fundamental"" failure of Windows UI. Quite simply, there is no clear vision or overall design in Windows.

It started with XP, but is more obvious in Vista. There is a complete lack of consistency, ranging from the subtle colour differences, to completely different layouts, fonts, etc. There are even parts of Vista that use unthemed pre-XP widgets. IE7 is a complete disaster of a UI, toolbar buttons spread seemingly at random over at least 3 different areas of the screen.

Throw in office and any applications written in .Net, and you get another set of different UI styles. 

What a mess.

It's not like Microsoft aren't trying, but they definitely aren't trying hard enough, it's stupid really, the one part of the OS that really gets people excited, the one part that can be shown off and really marketed is the UI, but Microsoft doesn't make it a priority.

It seems like the designers produce a few UI mockups and then leave the details and the areas that weren't shown in the mockups to the programmers. Programmers who have no design training and just make their part of the OS look cool in their opinion, with no regard for what the overall effect is.

Another part of the issue is architectural, historically (in the 16-bit era) the original ""standard"" Windows widgets (the ""GDI"" widgets) were limited and inadequate, missing many useful widgets (such as sliders, toolbars, etc), so many developers produced their own versions of these widgets.

Later, Microsoft produced their own set of ""advanced"" widgets, first as part of MFC and later as the ""common controls"" library. Most Win32 application UIs are based on these, with the obvious exception of Office. Of course, Office-inspired UIs started making their way into Windows, and Microsoft and third parties made custom widgets and ""skinned"" applications, etc.

Then XP came along with a whole new design ""Luna"", unfortunately, only ""GDI"" and (the latest version of) ""common controls"" widgets got the new theme, leaving many older applications, as well as Office, stuck with the 9x look. Worse, there were many applications and parts of Windows that mixed ""GDI"", ""common controls"" and custom widgets (GDI scrollbars are especially common), resulting in a mixture of UI styles, even within the same dialog boxes.

Then .Net was thrown into the mix, with a new standard UI (System.Windows.Forms) that was based on office, but with optional theming that almost-but-not-quite matches the system theme.

Finally, Vista came along, introducing another new appearance (fortunately, applications that pick up the theme in XP still work correctly in Vista, but some applications that draw their own XP-style widgets now look out of place), as well as *another* new UI framework/library, WPF for .Net, which again uses another UI style.


This is an absolute mess and will take a huge amount of work to fix, but in my opinion is absolutely necessary to produce a truly usable version of Windows.","1225586765"

1. Fiction books provide a *different*, not *better*, kind of immersion compared with a movie, comic book, or music video.

Well, I've got reality that I should be investing in.

2. Popular nonfiction books **suck**.  The last two or three I read could have been condensed into a few pages.  The rest was repetition and fluff.  My theory is that the authors are trying to make their books look big enough to be worth the money.

3. That leaves a third category, ""honest nonfiction"".  This is the kind of book written by someone who isn't writing fluff so it will sell.  There's a lot of worthwhile reading here, but it's difficult to find someone that fits your level of understanding and intelligence.  If the book is too easy or too hard, reading it becomes a chore.  A *worthwhile* chore, maybe, but it's still a chore.  How many people do you know who do chores voluntarily?

&gt;Anyone who questions the current system gets put away in a box till they're too old to protest anymore.

You just questioned the current system. I have questioned the current system, joined organization dedicated to changing the system, engaged in public protests, etc. Yet neither of use are in a ""box"". 

You might have legitimate grievances, but making obviously contra-factual claims does not help your cause.

""Anonymity"" by itself implies statelessness. Anonymity, isn't an end in and of itself, but a foundation that further structure can be built upon. An anonymous discussion system is going to have a severe lack of continuity, and it doesn't take much for trolls (either manual or automated) to destroy it. A pseudonym system facilitates discussion by giving context to comments and mitigating the effects of vandals through reputation.

&gt; .onion is totally different, that is the underground web. That is what this proxy is for.

&gt; Mainstream people who come to .onion see all the pedo stuff and freak out trying to destroy it.

I know the technicals. I don't care about desperate housewives freaking out when they stumble across Chronicles of a Serial Killer. Now will they organize and successfully persecute anonymity technology? This is an attack that privacy systems in general have to account for. Trying to delay isn't a substitute for fixing it.

&gt; I understand your desires, as I shared them too, but real world practice shows, people aren't ready.

At what point does the angry mob become ready ? Though perhaps I do see a point that its better to create tools that allow easy publishing and reading at the same time, rather than giving the sheeple a read-only view.
