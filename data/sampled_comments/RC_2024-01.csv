Eating well, drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, exercising. All easier said than done, but it can really help if you find a way to do it consistently. As to how you would do that, hopefully the poster you're responding to has some good advice for all of us! I'll try to give a few tips that work for me:

Fish oil can be helpful

Find things that excite your brain or exert your brain so much that it relaxes for a bit after (for me, the latter is accomplished with ballet. Physically and mentally demanding)

Try out taking meds before bed. For me, this works. My brain gets better quality sleep. It's honestly kind of weird going to sleep and then just waking up and it's suddenly morning. Normally I'm still somewhat aware of the passage of time through the night.",1704067200.0

Part of this project is a fundraiser for [The Boys & Girls Clubs of America](https://bgca.org) to make a positive impact on children! We‚Äôll also be organizing a variety of contests for community members to win things such as 40+ NBA All-Star Saturday Night tickets, various signed               basketball items and hosting a community meetup with free swag and food!

Our ambitious target is to reach **$100,000 USD, with Reddit generously matching up to $25,000 USD.** This means that if we, as a community, manage to raise $25,000 USD, the effective total will be $50,000 USD through the [Community Funds program.](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-         us/articles/15484345935508-Community-Funds)

Recently we announced that Reddit Community Funds and r/NBA will be teaming up to celebrate the subs 15th Cake Day! 

Part of this project is a fundraiser for [The Boys & Girls Clubs of America](https://bgca.org) to make a positive impact on children! We‚Äôll also be organizing a variety of contests for community members to win things such as 40+ NBA All-Star Saturday Night tickets, various signed               basketball items and hosting a community meetup with free swag and food!

Our ambitious target is to reach **$100,000 USD, with Reddit generously matching up to $25,000 USD.** This means that if we, as a community, manage to raise $25,000 USD, the effective total will be $50,000 USD through the [Community Funds program.](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-         us/articles/15484345935508-Community-Funds)

If you have the means, any contribution, **no matter how big or small**, would be greatly appreciated:

"tolkienfans","t5_2r6jm","Nope, they are different cries. The cry of the dying WK is described as ‚Äúso terrible‚Äù, ie terrifying, it leaves those who hear it momentarily paralyzed, but the cry of the flying Nazgul is full of ‚Äúwoe and dismay,‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt leave Frodo or Sam afraid at all. It also does not leave Frodo and Sam filled with hope when it goes, as the WK‚Äôs cry does for those on the Pellenor Field Also, the cry of the WK goes up into the sky and then ‚Äúdies away on the wind‚Äù, never to be heard again. It does not recede into the distance. Clearly it did not continue all the way past the Ephel Duath. In the passage you cite, the figure crosses the Ephel Duath and is crying the whole time it goes. 

The fact that the shape Frodo sees isn‚Äôt described as having wings doesn‚Äôt prove anything. Its description is clearly in line with a large object flying fast. It grows in size as it comes towards them and then plunges through clouds. 

Finally, we see two examples of spirits after death: Sauron and Saruman. Neither seem to be objects with mass, visible from a distance and flying fast. They are smoke that blows away on a wind and disperses. Plus the only spirits we see rising from corpses after death belong to powerful maiar, not humans. And a human spirit flying east after death makes little sense in regard to Tolkien‚Äôs cosmology/theology. No, this is 100% clearly not the spirit of the WK, and your reading is not the simplest interpretation of the text. It‚Äôs a stretch at best. The simplest interpretation is just as the text says: it‚Äôs a Nazgul full of despair, flying east to bring tidings‚Äî ie news‚Äî of the end of the WK to Sauron.",1704067201.0

>fan noise is, pretty quiet


 I'm just gonna be blunt with ya. It is in no way even close to as light or quiet as, the Mac. Nowhere close. You got macs that are literally fanless and even ones with fans you just won't hear as they're way too efficient.

>Having RGB

Cool. I just don't care for it. That was a personal preference. I don't like having to deal with all the settings and often having to download the third party software to manage all that, but you do you there.

>Mine gets 8 hours

You just linked one with a 4090 and you even said in your original comment 4090 dude. The battery life on those simply aren't on part with the M series macs my man. They get beat pretty handedly there. It's just a fact my man. You have to try and get all these battery packs and constantly have it plugged into something. Macs don't need all that and can be charged within the hour and last forever. Battery life is Mac hands down.

>You'll spend most of your time plugged in

No thanks. I have a mobile device, because I don't want to be plugged in. Hence the battery life mattering big time and the cool part is you don't have to be plugged in to get the max power liked you often do in windows.

Like I said in my original comment, macs have certain strengths that you get them for. You have all the added ecosystem stuff if you want that too since the fam has iphones and all that jazz. I'm not here to argue which is better. I'm saying macs have their place and do certain things better than the alternative. I'm definitely gonna notice when I gotta lug a gaming laptop around vs my Mac feels like nothing. For intensive stuff it just makes sense for me to use my desktop. Especially since you said you'll be lucky to get two hours unplugged on the laptop.

You just can't beat a desktop price and workload wise. The one you linked is also capped at 32GB of RAM and I need a ton more for my workloads. If I want I can even just remote into my desktop and use it as my gaming server and outperform the  whatever laptop and play for more than 2 hours or whatever. Different strokes for different folks.

"NevilleGoddard2","t5_5qe8rk","""No reacting to the 3D"" - Theres nothing wrong with reacting to the 3D, we aren't robots. Suppressing emotions will make you feel much worse than just letting them out. Also, reactions alone don't manifest, your assumptions about reacting are what manifests so if you believe that reacting can or will mess things up than it can &/or will but if you believe the opposite than it won't mess up anything.

""Watch everything you say"" - Same with reacting, words alone do not manifest, whatever your words imply to you are what manifest so it really doesn't matter what you say at all. To the ones that like affirming, you can even use negative words in your affirmations and they can still produce positive effects if you give them a positive meaning.

""The mind needs to accept your desire before you can have it"" - Based off my experience, it really doesn't. The mind is a projection of consciousness & it isn't separate from you (pure awareness). So if its having a hard time or if it isn't willing to accept the new story than you don't have to force it to believe in the desired outcome. Just allow the thoughts to be without resisting them or assigning meaning to them because it'll save you a whole lot of energy & it'll help you to realize that resistant thoughts & thoughts in general only have the legitimacy that one decides to give to them.

2. Glad we agree

3. Ditto

4. Almost all of the deaths in the Donbas War happened in the first two years. After that it was relatively low level, a few dozen people getting killed a year. Still bad, but the invasion in 2022 killed more people in months than had died in the previous 8 years. 

And Ukraine was dealing with armed rebels who were serving the interests of a foreign power and were being aided militarily by a foreign power. At some points, Russian troops were deployed in Donbas, so Ukraine was dealing with an invasion. Any other country would use military force, especially Russia. So I don't see what your problem is. It's Russia and the separatists' fault that the war was going on and they started the war.

Sometimes it can be concerning to sit down and order food and wait around just to see another group get their food faster than us despite them arriving after us. Is it the kind of food we ordered? Did something happen in the kitchen to delay our food? Or is it just a backlog because it‚Äôs a busy night?

Do you suggest ordering an appetizer that may come out sooner just so the customers don‚Äôt wait for it?

Unless the customer is a Karen, their frustration can be assuaged by simply giving regular updates on the situation/checking in and asking what can be done to help them feel better about waiting 40min for a meal. Sometimes when people are annoyed with food taking long to come out is not having any idea that it will take 40min to come out and wanting some communication and sympathy that they are waiting for a long time.

"discordapp","t5_388p4","Hi!  
The image(s) you've submitted appear to contain a common DM scam. DM scams like these usually come from compromised user or bot accounts.

When looking at a possible scam from either a bot account or user account, always consider if they:

- Are new, unfamiliar, unverified (in the case of bot accounts) or contacting you unprompted
- Are not from Discord: not through email from them, or from a [System-tagged account](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360036118732)
- Have poor grammar, spelling or misuse punctuation or capitalisation
- Offer things that are 'too good to be true'

Official Discord gifts use the `discord.gift` domain, and will generate a special embed, [shown in this image](https://imgur.com/Xsy1zdE). These gifts can be claimed entirely **in-app**, by pressing the Accept button that generates **inside the embed**, so you should not trust any without that button, or whose buttons are outside the embed or take you out of the app.

- - -

To get rid of this bot, you can:

- Block it
- [Report it to Discord](https://dis.gd/howtoreport)

If these types of bots are repeatedly sending you messages, you can:

- Use Mutual Servers to determine the server(s) they share with you, and disable Direct Messages from server members for those servers.
- If you cannot find any common servers, you can disable DMs from all servers under your User Settings

If your account is the one sending this message, then it means your account has been compromised. If you...

- ... downloaded and executed malware: You should try and use a different device entirely to change your password (e.g. your phone). You should then [follow these steps](https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115004307527--Windows-Corrupt-Installation) to fully uninstall Discord, run a complete anti-virus scan, and then re-install Discord. If your account is compromised again when logging in afterwards, you may need to factory reset your computer.
- ... entered your password into a malicious/fake website: You should change your password. 
- ... scanned a QR code in-app and then authorized the login: You should change your password.
- ... did something else: You should change your password.

You should also check your Authorised Apps (under User Settings) to ensure that no suspicious applications have been added (remove any that you don't recognise or didn't add, especially those with ""Join servers for you""). If you had payment information saved, you should also double check to ensure no gifts were bought whilst your account was compromised.

I really like Storm but wished she had more of a character arch rather than becoming increasingly op. She didnt have a ton of inner character struggle except for the techno -organic virus she briefly had. 

After Hickman left, I felt the best single issues were from Immortal X-men and even then they felt a little disjointed. Luckily, they were pretty good comics as single issues.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9",">You do understand the same thing goes for Lyanna right?

I don‚Äôt think this is true if you‚Äôre talking about theories taken seriously by the fanbase. In this fandom there‚Äôs basically an infinite number of theories so you can always find a bunch of fringe ideas, and I have seen some weird ones about Lyanna, but the most prominent theories about her are generally well grounded in the text.

>It's the same as someone else saying Ned and Ashara fell in love at Harrenhal

No, that is something explicitly suggested to the reader.

>Unlike Ashara's relationship with Ned, Lyanna's relationship with Rhaegar or her being the Knight of Laughing Tree is neither explicitly nor implicitly mentioned anywhere in the story. Those theories are far more speculative than someone saying that Ned and Ashara were in love tbh.

Did you not read my entire post? I straight up acknowledged N + A as something explicitly suggested by the text, my point was that most Ashara theories either fall into that category, where there‚Äôs no need to piece anything together to make a prediction instead of just taking what we‚Äôre told at face value, *or* they‚Äôre speculative to the point of having almost no textual basis beyond being technically possible.

That R + L or TKOTL are not mentioned in the story is my entire point - these are theories that will be true or have a high likelihood of being true in spite of that. Do you think Howland + Ashara has a similar likelihood of being true? The only Ashara theory (beyond something super generic like ‚Äúshe had something to do with the ToJ‚Äù) that I personally think is likely true but not explicitly suggested in the text is that Brandon is the Stark she had a thing with, not Ned. Are there a bunch of other common Ashara theories that you feel are comparably probable to the major ones about Lyanna?",1704067208.0

The purpose of coupling isn't to work together on your skills and talents. I appreciate the skills and talents of men, women, and people who fit neither category; that doesn't mean I want to date them. What you're describing is basically a coworker. A physically ugly woman is in the same boat as a man with no ambition and a low salary. It doesn't matter how nice or intelligent or talented they are if they're not hitting the notes that are necessary to make a romantic relationship work.

I select friends based on their hearts, skills, and talents. I select romantic partners based on their hearts, skills, talents, and how attractive I find them. I don't see any problem with this circumstance.

"AITAH","t5_446kys","Of course, a relationship based on how ""usable"" a person is to you isn't going to make you feel good.

Why would being with a woman who is only with you for the money, status, and appearance you provide her with make you feel good?

She's only there to use you, she knows you're only using her.

You're with each other to use each other and make others envious of 'how well you're doing'.

Of course, that's not going to feel good. Of course, you're not going to feel comfortable, happy, secured, loved, cared for, safe with a woman who will be out the door if you lose your job, or get into a car accident leaving you crippled, or get 3rd degree facial burns which would disfigure you.

Of course, she's not going to feel comfortable, happy, secured, loved, cared for, safe with a man who feels the same way about her.

Of course, you both aren't going to make each other feel good.

If you want to change that... start by no longer attempting to buy women who you feel are prettier than you are. That doesn't mean ""don't date pretty women"" it means ""don't date pretty women who wouldn't date you if you were broke"".

Stop thinking about relationships as a status symbol making you look good to other people. Start paying attention to how women make you feel about yourself, without being concerned about what they look like.

Start paying attention to how you make women feel about themselves. How you judge them, and treat them, based on what they look like.

Are you nicer to prettier girls? Why?

Does it make you feel good when women are nicer to men who are more attractive than you are? If not, why are you perpetuating that feeling by putting more of that out there into the world?

Do you look down on people with less money than you have? Why?

Does it make you feel good when men who are wealthier than you are treat you worse? If not, why are you perpetuating that feeling by putting more of that out there into the world?

How would you want those you consider better than you to treat you? Do you treat those you consider beneath you that way?

Are you kind, generous, non-judgmental to those who are less fortunate, less successful, less attractive than you are?

&#x200B;

>People need to realise that world is much more superficial than what they wanna believe.

The world I live in isn't superficial like that at all.

But then again, I go through life as see those like you, who believe the world is superficial, and that it's therefore okay for they themselves to be superficial as well, and I avoid them.

I went back to proper swimming after 10 - 15 years of no swimming (or casual holiday swimming once a year).  It was really, really hard.  I think I nearly drowned on my first length (and I say this as a relatively fit person who could easily run 20k at the time.  I was training for a triathlon and this was the start of my swimming practice).  

My only other recommendation is to check the timetables.  The main frustration for me was that the pool was always shut for this or that (or half of it is) which limited the times I could go and do what I wanted.  Best to check before you go.

"BoomersBeingFools","t5_22p3je","OMG.

Same here.   I'm north of 55 years and work in IT for a major corp.  Total Microsoft shop.

Started with co. 2 years ago and they were emailing spreadsheets around... and using spreadsheets named ""Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of Copy of...""

I send email to my new boss and other person I'll be working with, and explain that I prefer not to email spreadsheets, but rather, simply share them.  This way, we'd all have the same data in front of us.

Apparently, this was a foreign concept to them.

I received a long reply telling me I was likely in the wrong job and that they were going to use spreadsheets, and that I'd better learn how to use them, because they didn't care that I didn't like them.  ""The big boss loves them and we're not going to challenge her...""

I stared at the email and then replied back with ""I think you misread what I wrote.  I never said I hated spreadsheets; I said we should be sharing them, instead of emailing versions around.""

Not long after, I was asked to compile data for a project and added some VBA code to it, so that when you double clicked a cell, you could change the cell's value into a hyperlink that took you directly to that record in ServiceNow.

And I shared it - I didn't attach a copy of it.

The change was slow, but over time, people started to figure out that emailing a file was dumb and so now they all share files, instead.

Also, I became Excel guru (but I'm not), and now do all the reporting and data wrangling for IT across North America.   

I still laugh at that email.

And once in a while, someone outside the group emails a spreadsheet.  I immediately ask them to share it, instead.  If they don't know how, I will explain.  Once.",1704067208.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Thanks for your submission /u/FireFireinameWire, but it has been removed for the following reason:

Disallowed question area: **Rant or loaded question** 

NoStupidQuestions is a place to ask any question as long as *it's asked in good faith*. Our users routinely report questions that they feel violate this rule to us. Want to avoid your question being seen as a bad faith question? Common mistakes include (but are not limited to): 

* Rants: Could your question be answered with *'That's awful'* or *'What an asshole'*? Then it's probably a rant rather than a genuine question. Looking for a place to vent on Reddit? Try /r/TrueOffMyChest or /r/Rant instead.

* Loaded questions: Could your question be answered with *'You're right'*? Answering the question yourself, explaining your reasoning for your opinion, or making sweeping assumptions about the question itself all signals that you may not be keeping an open mind. Want to know why people have a different opinion than you? Try /r/ExplainBothSides instead!

* Arguments: Arguing or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) with people giving you answers tells everyone that you have an answer in mind already. Want a good debate? Try /r/ChangeMyView instead!

* Pot Stirring: Did you bring up unnecessary topics in your question? Especially when a topic has to do with already controversial issues like politics, race, gender or sex, this can be seen as trying to score points against the Other Side - and that makes people defensive, which leads to arguments. Questions like *""If _____ is allowed, why isn't _____?""* don't need to have that comparison - just ask *'why isn't ____ allowed?'*.

* Complaining about moderation: If you disagree with how the sub is run or a decision the mods have made, that's fine! But please share your thoughts with us in modmail rather than as a public post. 

Disagree with the mods? If you believe you asked your question in good faith, try rewording it or message the mods to see if there's a way you could ask more neutrally. Thanks for your understanding!

"AlienBabes","t5_2vke98","Infinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It‚Äôs been three minutes. You can‚Äôt stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It‚Äôs been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúCummet.‚Äù You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.",1704067209.0

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","Sure I'm comically overstating, a little, but it absolutely shits on other MFing strategies this league.

You get more rewards from Abysses than from multiple maps without them. Then you also get the rest of the map, which in turn gives you overall more efficiency on investing into your maps.

It changes *almost* nothing about your wisp juice because that's largely down to what the layout spawns.

Anything you do replace it with is going to give you a tiny fraction of the loot.


The primary time expenditure with abyss is looting, you save seconds over other strategies that have many dozens fewer rares and literal thousands fewer mobs

Like I get it, you personally find it annoying, so you've opted for a strategy with substantially less rewards per time or investment spent as a ratio.

But don't come in here with the absolutely unhinged take that it isn't substantially more rewards. You invest like an extra 0.5 divines for what amounts to a 100-200% more loot multiplier.


It also combos better than anything else with beyond, which you're going to be running.",1704067209.0

"GTA","t5_2ra77","The game's designed with the assumption that you're using auto-aim, and not using it is basically gimping yourself, which becomes very evident with the absurd accuracy requirements for gold medals on missions. Many of the weapons are also balanced around the auto-aim mechanics, not that they're very well balanced.

Rockstar also can't tune decent analog stick controls for shit, so aiming without it feels horrible even after tweaking deadzone and acceleration. 

Ironically, despite Rockstar being a dev that prioritizes the console versions of their games, playing on PC with keyboard and mouse without auto aim is far better, but then some aspects of the game's design break down because the game was designed for auto aim. Without auto aim, the bolt action rifle in RDR2 starts to look redundant since the carcano is so much more powerful and reloads faster. Being less accurate when shooting while driving in GTA stops being a thing entirely.

If you want people to not rely on auto aim, the game should be designed such that it's not necessary. That'll likely only happen if Rockstar decides to abandon auto aim entirely and go for a softer form of aim assist that most shooters have on gamepad nowadays, but since Rockstar's game design still seems stuck in the PS2-era, I'll be surprised if that happens.",1704067210.0

Remember the talk of the Petro dollar? Remember Iraq saying that they would begin to trade oil for euros instead of just dollars and how the USA was like how about no?

It's already happening and oil is definitely going to be one of the first steps that we see. We will see that the dollar begins to lose against the Euro and that a variety of countries begin to hold more Euros while reducing their supply of dollars by just spending their dollars and not buying as many as they used to hold. This is already happening.

Historically speaking, the USA is now debasing its currency in a manner which is not unlike what the Romans did. The money machine goes brrrrrrr. It's only a matter of time now. Ever notice that the cost of everything is much higher than even one or two years ago? That's going to happen a lot and that massive inflation means that it's not a good idea for other countries to hold US dollars because every year they're worth less and not a little bit less like 3% but more like 30% less year over year.

"MarvelStudiosSpoilers","t5_3e7dq","Back when *The First Avenger* came out, Atwell said (mostly as a joke) that she was interested in playing Sharon Carter so she could still star in future *Captain America* films. The actress who was actually cast as Sharon - Emily VanCamp - received a ton of harassment and death threats when she got the part, and certain people think Atwell encouraged or even started it as a sort of revenge for VanCamp ""stealing"" the part she wanted.

Some even think that she somehow pulled strings to have Sharon's role reduced in the later films - along with making her an outright villain in *Falcon/Winter Soldier* - so they could push Peggy back to the forefront in her new Captain Carter persona. And in general, it's often joked that she must have some kind of dirt on Feige or someone else at Marvel to still keep her character around several years after she already died.

There's also theories/rumours in the *Agents Of SHIELD* fandom that Atwell has some kind of feud with that show's cast (especially Chloe Bennet, who plays Quake) since her *Agent Carter* series got cancelled and cut short while theirs got a proper ending.",1704067211.0

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","I told my therapist I've just been trying to get from one ""milestone"" to the next.  Those milestones have been special occasions: our wedding anniversary, our dating anniversary, Christmas, New Year's, etc.

New Year's isn't really over yet per se, but I'm not even hoping for anything at this point.

We have a big trip coming up in January to celebrate her birthday, but TBH I'm not optimistic about that, either.

I'm not even optimistic about Valentine's Day.

The next milestone after that would be my birthday in May.  I'm not sure yet if I'll say anything about her lack of libido in our couple's therapy sessions before then, but I'll definitely say something afterward if nothing happens by then.

I've already said in therapy, ""I signed up for monogamy, not celibacy.""

Our therapist has encouraged other forms of physical intimacy that aren't sexual while my wife works through the psychological issues affecting her libido.  But over the holidays I've felt like the only one trying to initiate any kind of physical touch, even just a hug or holding hands.

I don't know yet what my limit is, but after my birthday I expect to know.",1704067211.0

"Actuallylesbian","t5_26647x","I'm in a similar boat. Single since the end of 2016. I'm now 35. 

I've been able to use this time to figure out what I want. Don't want kids, need someone independent, forthright, honest and faithful. Not interested in casual but am interested in getting to know new people. I've also learned that I'm ok on my own -- I'm a whole person and if I spend my life single I'll be alright.

I've found it very helpful to do things consistently. Join a hobby group (there are tonnes of queer sports teams, gaming groups, hiking groups, all sorts) and keep attending; you'll meet new people and have a built-in thing to talk about which puts you on the right foot. You have to keep going, get more familiar with people, interact more. Consistency is key.

You're allowed to go wherever you want. It's not your responsibility to manage other people's anxieties or feelings. They're adults, they can do that. You're entitled to a life and you can do what you want to do. And you don't need anyone to go somewhere with you, it's perfectly doable to be on your own out at clubs or pubs. Gather the stones to talk to new people and you won't be on your own. And you're only too ""old"" for things when you're dead. This is YOUR life. Live it as you see fit.

I, too, am nervous about being rubbish at sex because I'm so out of practice but, as I learned when I first started having sex, it's a skill...it requires practice. You can fall out of practice but that means you can also get better at it, and all that needs is clear and open communication with a partner who knows what she needs.",1704067212.0

"DanhengMains","t5_52u608","Idk what you mean by significant upgrade. In terms of damage, YK still takes it since she's sorta custom-made for DHIL, her A4 + S5 PR is just a lot of free DMG%. And her ult buffs combined with E2 DHIL are uncontested in damage for now until Hanabi comes out. 

That said, Ruan Mei does excel in providing more consistent buffs albeit lowering DHIL's damage output by a bit. She is typically better for DHIL when the enemies aren't weak to IMG.  Otherwise, the only other benefit is that she's SP positive and much easier to manage than Yukong (yes, I'm aware E6 Yukong can be 100% SP-positive as well, but her buffing potential will be weaker).

TLDR: Ruan Mei isn't necessary at all for DHIL, she's been called a universally good support and can be slotted anywhere (preferably duo DPS), but doesn't beat out Harmony units geared towards hypercarry comps like Bronya, Hanabi, Yukong, and TY (in some situations).",1704067213.0

"MajorityReport","t5_549kw5","Many Hamas soldiers are Palestinians. Israel pulled out of the region and the Palestinians allowed Hamas to take over.

Yes there is a difference between Hamas rockets and an Israeli rocket but Hamas has been indiscriminately shooting rockets into Israel, on a constant basis, for over 15 years and have killed many civilians because these rockets are not guided. So, apparently Hamas doesn‚Äôt care who they kill with the rockets, military or civilian. 

Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the Iron Dome system, which doesn‚Äôt get all of the rockets. 

How much should Israel take before saying enough is enough? 

The open air prison doesn‚Äôt really fly because they have been allowed to have self determination in Gaza since 2005. It is true that there are blockades on things getting into Gaza, but that‚Äôs because they are getting arms and supplies to build rockets, as well as actual rockets from Iran. So they can play the victim all they want but they are allowing Hamas to do this as well as the PLO before.",1704067215.0

"PowerScaling","t5_yrt2z","After reviewing the colossus of rhodes boss fight; i will admit i am wrong about the blade of olympus. It can and does actively drain divine power on contract. 

This would make the blade of olympus capable of draining goku‚Äôs god ki. 

HOWEVER; what you cited has no demonstration of power absorption OR nullification. Additionally, none of the characters mentioned for this fight wield the blade of Olympus as part of their standard toolkit. Only zeus had ever used it before, and he no longer has it by the time of his final boss fight. Discussing what the blade can do is, at most, tangentially relevant as a reference point of durability and resistance for zeus. 

And regardless of what the blade took from kratos,  you‚Äôve yet to adress that zeus also has power absorption independent of the blade. The whole reason the colossus of rhodes came to life is because zeus absorbed some of kratos‚Äôs power and put it into the colossus.",1704067218.0

When I first got my Beyond, I couldn't see anything through the lenses.  SteamVR reported an error with the interface 'SceneSystem\_002' every time I restarted or plugged the device in.  I then opened a ticket through their discord channel and never received a response, except when they implemented a new automated system.  I then decided, after reading similar issues with other games in the past, to uninstall my graphics drivers in safe mode using DDU and re-install.  That FINALLY got it working, 2 weeks after I received it.  You'd think there'd at least be a pinned post or FAQ posted somewhere to reference. 
2. Glare - once I got it working, I found myself constantly wiping the lenses because it always looked blurry.  Turned out it was the glare.  I mean, it is THAT BAD to me!!  I turned down the brightness to 30% so now it's not as apparent, but I'm playing in darker environments now.
3. Gasket - my IPD is right, but my eyes are too close to the lenses, even touched on a couple occasions.  I loosened the strap and added magnets to space it out a little, but now light is leaking through.  I opened another ticket and have been waiting so far 1 week for a response.

Last night, I jumped back to my Quest for a couple driving sessions and the magic of VR came back again.  I didn't have to fiddle with the headset to find the right orientation for an acceptable view.  Everything looked much clearer with a decent level of ambient lighting through the lenses.

I want to like this unit, don't get me wrong.  It is definitely more comfortable than wearing a Quest cellphone on my face.  But this has taught me to value performance and usability over comfort.  I'll wait for the new gasket to see if the added spacing helps and I know there's a 3rd party that is making anti-glare lenses, to see if it addresses the glare issue.  But if you were to ask me right now based on my experience, I would say wait until the 2nd or even the 3rd gen of this product before jumping in.  The technology will advance, and the company will grow enough to support their product better.",1704067218.0

If you see a rumour on the performance of a product before a rumour on the release date, it's probably bullshit. 

Predicting a 100% performance jump is not realistic. If you take rasterized performance averages the 4090 isn't even a 70% performance jump over the 3090. It only reaches those 70% performance jump metrics with DLSS. A DLSS tech that for absolutely no reason at all, but to sell 4000 series, the 3090 doesn't have access to. It depends entirely on the circumstance you are looking at. Exponential growth makes 100% performance jumps incredibly difficult to pull off.",1704067218.0

Most of my classes use a digital textbook (or at least have it as an option and most students pick it), so I don't allow the text.

I have basically 1 point per minute for midterms, 1 per 1.5 minutes for finals, so they have time to check something quickly *if* they thought to put it on their sheet and their sheet is organized. We do talk about strategy - don't write so small you can't read it, don't use pencil (it smudges and is hard to read with harsh overhead lighting), think about what you personally are having difficulty with.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","Snape dedicated his whole life fighting evil at huge personal cost as well and he certainly is seen as morally grey. Snape was the same age when he left Death Eaters as Dumbledore was when he was acting like Grindelwald‚Äôs follower and plotting how to rule over muggles. 

So I think both early actions do matter and what you do with your life beyond fighting evil. Aberforth was right that Dumbledore remained his whole life secretive and wanting to remain in control. He was only the person who let Snape treat students the way he did as Snape‚Äôs boss and had Harry live with Dursley‚Äôs. Dumbledore might be brilliant but it doesn‚Äôt mean he did no wrong for ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù or because he didn‚Äôt see that there is another way. Maybe Snape needed to teach and Harry needed to live with Dursley‚Äôs but it doesn‚Äôt mean mean he should not have had talks with both to treat people better, I would say that was his responsibility. He could have even raised Harry himself if he wanted to.

Also I don‚Äôt think the way he ran the war was always ideals. Maybe this isn‚Äôt a moral issue, but practically it‚Äôs a big one. Draco could have killed Leanne and Ron or the Death Eaters in caste plenty of people for example. Dumbledore should have protected his castle from Malfoy and there are other times he in general didn‚Äôt do a good job in protecting students (like with Chamber of Secrets year). It‚Äôs up to depate if it‚Äôs due to incompetence or him not really seeing doing more are his responsibility because someone else (like Malfoy and Riddle) were actually doing the violent actions.

I think all people are morally grey anyway. At least that‚Äôs more useful way to think of characters in the series. Otherwise it‚Äôs easy to get blinded by someone‚Äôs image like Dumbledore (the way so many like Dodge in the books refused to entertain ideas that he had flaws). In real life maybe we should not be critical of people who try their best since it‚Äôs uncharitable, and Dumbledore was trying. But this is literature, we ideally learn something, even from admirable characters flaws.",1704067220.0

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","Crossbows being their own group is a very nice QoL change in the sense that they‚Äôre now clearly defined for the purpose of crossbow related options. As for the changes themselves, I‚Äôm overall mixed. There‚Äôs basically three major things to consider: the crit spec, the consequences of being a weapon group, and some feat and other indirect changes. 

The crit spec I‚Äôm not a fan of. Bleed is heavily saturated and the bow crit spec is still a non-save. You can get the bow effect back at 9 with a Grievous Rune, but that‚Äôs expensive, pretty far into a campaign, and uses up a rune slot. If nothing else procs bleeds and you aren‚Äôt fighting a bunch of things immune to bleed (not an ultra common immunity, but pops up fairly often, including on enemies problematic for other character types). Plus, Dart already did bleed, as did knife, so it‚Äôs not a new thing for ranged. 

The weapon category thing matters in two cases, Fighter and Archer. For Fighter, it sucks, as now you have to choose between Bows and Crossbows, and Archer only gives you bows. There‚Äôs no Crossbow equivalent to archer either for Warpriest. Of note though, this is potentially only a temporary issue, as Core 2 is where all the archetypes will be. Crossbows might get their own or be included in Remaster Archer. 

Now the feats and indirect changes are where the really nice changes are. Crossbow Ace means anyone can get a really decent Reload compress by going Ranger, meaning there‚Äôs a solid way to have it at level 4 on anyone. Swap is huge as well, meaning starting crossbow and going to melee is a one action cost. Lightning Swap is available low level on Fighter as well, meaning you can do something like dual crossbow attacks into Lightning Swap for whatever else. And the Aid DC is now baseline 15, so Fake Out is even better. And since the Reinforce Rune exists now, crossbow and shield shenanigans are buffed as well. Performance is better as well, so investing in it for Ostentatious Reload also hurts less. All these minor changes mean there‚Äôs a lot more use cases and build options for using crossbows, both as main and side weapons. 

Overall, I think crossbows are still awkward as a main weapon outside of niche builds, as bows are nice primary weapons and firearms offer juicy crits. However, in a no firearm game or other game type where they‚Äôre worse (underwater heavy, lots of stealth, etc), or if you don‚Äôt want to crit fish or are a caster, crossbows can be a great sidearm. At least on games with enough gold/loot (or ABP) to maintain a second weapon.",1704067221.0

You would need actual evidence of the hit, so video, photos and witnesses. 

They asked you about the EEOC because they will only cover if your civil rights were violated. That does not mean that you do not have other options such as the Department of Labor or OSHA. Or any state specific laws. 

To file a lawsuit you would need enough evidence to show what you are saying to be true. It can be challenging to get that evidence. You at the very least can file a police report, permitting the statute of limitations has not expired and you have proof.

I think a better option for Bomb, however, would be Multi-Bomb.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","> Razar, the question is if there's controversy about the sex classification of an XYY man, which evidently there is not.

Yes, there is. For example, Matt Walsh [once defined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz1SP3i16xo) ""female"" as ""somebody with XX chromosomes, a female reproductive system, female gametes or eggs, and the ability, in principle, to ovulate and bear offspring"". So for example, if you assume he would define ""male"" as ""not female"", he would actually classify an XXX woman as a man. But while I can't find a direct quote of him saying this, I feel comfortable assuming he would similarly define ""male"" as ""somebody with XY chromosomes, a male reproductive system, male gametes or sperm, etc"". So in reality, he would just be stumped by XXX, XXY, XYY, etc, since they don't fall into either of his definitions, despite him claiming they collectively include all people",1704067224.0

"ukvisa","t5_32gvi","Hello, I can advise on this.

The law has changed many times over the last few decades. What is relevant to your friend are the rules that applied to children born outside the U.K. to British citizens prior to 1983. 

When your friend was born in 1973, the law did not allow mothers to transmit citizenship to their children born abroad. Therefore, at the time of your friend‚Äôs birth, she was not entitled to British citizenship as her father was not British.

However, the law has since changed allowing those born to British mothers or unmarried British fathers to register as British citizens. This applies to your friend. 

Your friend is entitled to register as a British citizen using form UKM [here](https://visas-immigration.service.gov.uk/product/nationality-ukm). This form can be completed online, it costs ¬£80, she will have to provide biometrics, and attend a citizenship ceremony at the local British Consulate. She will be given British citizenship by descent and then she will be entitled to apply for a British passport. She will not be able to give British citizenship to her own children as descent generally only passes to one generation born outside the U.K., however, her children will be eligible to apply for a U.K. ancestry visa which gives them the right to live and work in the U.K. for 5 years and enables them to seek permanent residency (ILR) after this. 

The application is relatively straightforward and she can do it probably without much difficulty. She will need her mother‚Äôs full birth certificate (can obtain a copy online from the GRO), her own birth certificate, and her mother‚Äôs old hardcover British passport stating her citizenship as United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC). 

There is a guidance document [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-ukm-guidance) .",1704067224.0
"FemdomCommunity","t5_2whne","Poppers are chemicals of the akyl nitrate class, of which a whole cluster of different chemicals may be used, as there's more than one drug that could produce their effect so when one was banned another compound would be substituted. They function as a vasal dilator, and as such pose a medical risk accordingly as far as potential side effects. For example, do not combine them with Viagra. 

Eating them is very bad. Do not drink. 

Different countries have a wildly different approach to them as far as legality - for example Canada explicitly bans them, but Australia does not.  Because of the complicated legal status they are typically sold as cleaning substances - which nobody uses them for. This work around occupies the same space of plausible deniability selling ""water pipes"" as for tobacco in places with anti-paraphrenialia laws.   Generally it's agreed they are a low risk recreational drug. 

You can get them at head shops and sex shops that cater to gay men. In Europe they might be sold at a night club. Or in Australia, at pharmacies.

Jaune might have appeared like he didn't change since he was hardstuck in the past and trauma when we reunite with him, but trauma and suffering will inevitably change character. He had undergone a whole journey with Alyx and Lewis, even facing betrayal and struggled with uncertainty of what time it was was, hoping that one day, RWBY will re-arrive while also looking for a way out of the Everafter himself.

I took it because I needed the money, but I quit after like 2 weeks because I was already burned out from the workload, and lost all morale because every caller I had was angry and verbally abusive.

"television","t5_2qh6e","They botched a lot of things but I dunno if the Bran-King thing was DDs fault.   

GRRMs plan for the books was to time skip so we‚Äôd see Bran an 8 year old head north of the wall then come back a 13 year old ready to be king?   If you stop reading Bran chapters at Storm of Swords this is a really solid plan.

But then, now 24 years later, we haven‚Äôt seen anymore details on where that‚Äôs going and if anything the 3 chapters we got in DWD make the Bran king story line even weaker by removing him from the kingdom and interacting with no one.  (In fact he hasn‚Äôt interacted with any major character since Theon‚Ä¶).  Some green dreams and light Warging does not make him a player in the game of thrones especially since we see Dany, Jon, Cersei and the rest making real moves. 

Just my opinion of course but It definitely adds to the problem in the show.  Brans off doing his own thing for 7 years, literally out of the story for Season 5 - then suddenly - KING!



I don‚Äôt know when D/D realized they weren‚Äôt going to get any detains on Bran beyond the chapters they had.  From when we know they sat down with GRRM Id imagine sometime around planning S4 is when they realized Bran was going nowhere.  They thought GRRM would let them know where things went but details never came and I bet going into S4 they thought ok how do we make this boy king and make sense?!  But then they had 3 years to write ANYTHING.  and they didn‚Äôt. and that‚Äôs their fault.  But also GRRM has had 24 years and hasn‚Äôt delivered anything else either.  And the reception it got is only gonna slow him down more‚Ä¶",1704067226.0

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemBoys/comments/18vkh3q/who_needs_some_fem_cock_to_suck_on_and_ride/) was removed because /r/FemBoys requires accounts to have a minimum amount of comment karma.

"BDSMAdvice","t5_3a545","Oh! Okay, that was a detail I needed before.

So again, the easy way out is diet. Lots of fibre, fibre supplements, low fat is good too. A clean gut leads to happy butt sex most of the time for most people. 

But if you're like me (I have IBS) and you *can't* take the easy way, I have a good method too. After your first BM of the day - this is best done on weekends - give yourself an enema as deep as you like. I prefer going small, but sometimes my gut forces the issue.

And then take 3 immodium. You should be good for at least 12 hours, possibly as long as 48. The recommended dose on the box is 2 pills, but they also say to increase it if that doesn't stop the horrors that the medicine is designed for.

Don't do this every day. Immodium is based on an opiate that thankfully doesn't pass the blood-brain barrier. It won't get you stoned, but it *can* be habit forming.

Either way, keep experimenting. Biology is a soft and squishy science.",1704067228.0

Me neither really, just pointing out a potential ulterior motive.

>\#2 I don't care if the metro council unanimously got this wrong. The same way I'm not going to suddenly support abolishing roe v wade because the supreme court decided it wasn't valid.

Oh come on, you can't just hack my little 'liberal' brain like that, comparing two different issues with different dynamics and venues at play.

>#3. Preventing investment is not a strategy to remedy systemic disinvestment.

Yeah, no shit. But it's not the plan to prevent all investments, just certain investments that aren't in the current communities interests.

You and Greenberg speak in this false dichotomy that investment can't occur in a system preventing gentrification and just go in a circle when asked why.

>The development matrix doesn't work because it doesn't exist, not sure how i mischaracterized something that they hasn't even been fleshed out yet.

Well, you stated that any development would be treated as gentrification. That and it 'doesn't work' which sounds like an informed take for something that doesn't exist. I dunno, thought maybe you had some insider information instead of just sour grapes from someone who has spoken some estate game before.

>Why would Craig force a development to move to the west end?

Read more carefully, because that's not what I was saying. What I was saying is if you believed Craig would intervene on gentrification efforts in West end neighborhoods were this regulation not in place. I wanted to see how much faith you got in this guy.

But you did follow that with good ideas. Good ideas that I'm not sure why you believe this not yet created matrix will prevent.

And this isn't a case of nimbyism. This is more like Plmkmyism. Please let me keep my yard ism.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Following along in a Missal isn't the same as worshipping in a meaningful way. It is just a chore that you have to do to understand anything or you just blank out waiting for it to be done. 

The problem is that a lot of people who like the TLM get their ""worship high"" from seeing  the traditions of the TLM as almost an outside observer. Most people have a hard time doing meaningful worship unless they are actively participating in some way. Which, again, is why V2 happened in the first place. The clergy, rightly, saw that most of the population was only attending Mass for either cultural or community reasons and wanted to bring the true meaning of the Mass to more of the population. The results of this have been iffy, but just going back to repeat the same thing that caused problems as soon as alternatives to church community presented themselves is going to have the same result in the long run. Honestly, I think the only fix to this issue is either more reverent NOs or the TLM in vernacular. As misguided as our Protestant brothers can be, they are right that in a world of millions of alternatives to church community, you have to balance making people feel part of worship and long term meaning to keep them there.",1704067228.0

Turner looks like a freakin' little leaguer making $300 mil who needs a freakin' snack and a nap. Schwarber is a freakin' disgrace of his hitter.

Your plant is suffering from an infestation of [mealybugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealybug). Manual removal with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol is recommended for spot treatment, with additional treatment via insecticidal soap for heavier infestations. Systemic pesticides may be helpful. Treatment should continue for several weeks. [More here](https://extension.umd.edu/resource/mealybugs-indoor-plants) 

Infested plants should be isolated as best as possible while treatment is ongoing.

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb",">It was imposing, this sand, meant to make people bow before it with its power. Kaza wasn‚Äôt about to do that; it seemed against his own style. Kaza put his hands out, almost like how a Yamanaka clan member did for their mind jutsu, just more angular. This was a trick he thought of during hard training. ‚ÄúFire release, fire breath jutsu,‚Äù he called out, blowing fire between his hands. It seemed to focus there and intensify, like it was a way to multiply the power of his fire or whatever he used‚Äîa way to focus his chakra into a single space and point between his hands perfectly.  
  
‚ÄúFire release, dynamite shot,‚Äù Kaza said as he fired out the small concentrated bit of chakra that shot right into the middle of the sea of sand coming at him and exploded massively, like dynamite, blowing away the sand and melting most of it into glass that fell harmlessly to the ground of the arena. The power of the move left the whole arena in shock. Kaza was breathing hard to gather himself after that attack.  
  
‚ÄúMy turn,‚Äù he said, taking out needles he had figured out when talking to one of the Sound ninja he had saved, Kin Tsuchi. He had talked to her and planned this move out completely. He held the needles in his hands and threw them. ‚ÄúTracking light needle strike,‚Äù he said as the needles moved, zooming through the sand and stabbing into Gaara from various angles. His light-speed strikes were about to slip through his defense, and while not doing anything close to critical damage, they did a bit of chip damage.  
  
The arena fell into a stunned silence for a moment as the dust and remnants of the exploded sand settled. The spectators, including Kaza's friends and fellow competitors, couldn't believe what they had just witnessed. The audacity and creativity of Kaza's tactics had left an indelible mark.",1704067230.0

"WarhammerCompetitive","t5_3mrre","I had a combo lined up to really buff the Sternguard. They already get Devastating wounds and can benefit from staying stationary or can advance and still shoot. Leading them with a Captain and Lieutenant I gave them a free stratagem every turn, sustained hits 1 and lethal hits on a 5+, plus ignores cover and +1ap with Storm of Fire. I think this can be exetremely devastating, but with how I deployed and moved them throughout the match they were out of LoS or range most of the time. Part of that was because of being in a brick, but I also mistakenly blocked them with a dreadnaught and the enemy was wise with terrain. 

I agree with having less bricks. Objective units would be nice, and I can see how you don't like Assault Intercessors though when they did get in melee they were surprisingly effective. The Terminators I wanted to try deploying on the frontline and advance moving up the board to draw some of the enemy's fire while my Sternguards, Hellblasters, & Dreadnaughts put in work from the rear.

Yet, it's very useful to find these inaccuracies to try and discredit valid overall arguments. 

I'll never know her reasoning behind that specific one you brought up -- maybe I'm missing some information, maybe you are? Who knows? Maybe she's wrong. That's just a fact of life. People are going to be wrong. However, her overall argument, seems incredibly sound. So I don't let myself be bothered by it.

"hometheater","t5_2rof6","Keep in mind it's not really a review, more like personal impression. You can especially tell with the SDR section. Praising it for making SDR look like HDR is not praise in terms of a objective review. SDR should never ever be above 100 nits and the TV is simply re-mapping likely both brightness and colors. Now increasing brightness is fine for some content like live sports, but not for movies. Especially not when you have the TV in a light controlled projector room! Subjectively you can ofc say you prefer over-brighten and over saturation, but the TV is not winning any prizes by doing that.

Another thing with all non Sony LCD TVs is that their dimming algorithm live-edits the content to make it look better. They had the typical ""near-OLED"" contrast/blacks (although one of their images showed a lot of light bleed...). That happens because TCL will straight up remove details in the image in order to turn off dimming zones so black levels improve. Also limit highlight and brightness in the image to avoid too much contrast. Also in contrast areas if the contrast is sharp they might even out the transition from bright to black. Subjectively this will look good because you do not have something else displaying the content to see how much they removed.

So the ""review"" then ends up being personal impressions which are heavily influenced by how TCL are changing the picture to make their TV look good in isolation. This is not tested side by side to anything. Even measurements in SDR is not listed if it's local dimming or not. And honestly those results in SDR, which most TVs can do no problem, are pretty abysmal.

Honestly the only thing from this video it seems to do better than other TVs is the size. Obviously a requirement in the room Linus has so it doesent even matter if it performs worse. I don't consider the brightnes a win really when the measurements show so much luminance error.",1704067232.0

Evidently homie is just screwing like a jack rabbit to get his genes out there. Kinda like my boy elon musk and nick cannon. They shouldn't be doing that, and they'll have to answer for it in the end. It's in our nature to abuse anything, and try to find a loop hole. 

The mahrame thing as uncomfortable as it is, a mahram is a protection for the woman. And I'm almost certain it's not obligatory, but some cultures again went overboard. Not necessarily Islam itself. 

The partying thing yes I know it belongs to them. I also know as someone who lives in the west, that it would've been better for me and many others not to get started on that path. I wish I would've had better influences in my life. People to show me a better alway to live, think about my future and so on. But everyone in my family partied and partied hard. And some of those things you do don't just affect you they affect your DNA making the next generation more susceptible to being attracted and addicted (talking about drugs and alcohol).

Well that didnt take long.The six year old thing I'm not 100 percent on on I've heard she was like a little older then that. And as uncomfortable as it sounds we can't compare those people to how we are now. For starters biologically it makes sense given that a woman's eggs are pretty much gone by her mid to late 30's. Pregnancies at that age are higher risk. Second I don't think any of his other wives were that young. If homie was a pedophile, we'd see alot more stories of him doodling kids. And we don't. 

Yes I am definitely saying being trans is Abad thing. Allowing a child to decide and put them on those drugs. Messing up their lives. I mean if your concerned about the 6 yr old straight girl because she don't know wtf is going on. Why does your moral compass flip here. We're literally sterilizing these kids and stopping them from enjoying the ability to orgasm. To feel bonded to someone else.

Windows does not write excessively more (mostly log) files then mac or linux. Putting an OS on a SD card will of course strain it more then if you did not do that.

BUT: The larger your SD card is. And the higher quality the chip is (=higher TBW). The less of a problem it is.

&#x200B;

Its the exact same for SSDs! Higher capacity and higher quality SSDs have higher TBW. Which is the main metric that will cause data failures.

&#x200B;

You can even get MicroSD cards with absolutely REDICULOUS amounts of TBW  like 500 TBW. Thats 500 \* 1000 GB = 500.000 half a million GB written.

At the slow data speeds of a microSD card that would take you years.

"PPC","t5_2qvdk","Right out of HS, randomly found a job working for a guy who would go on to become one of those really well known gurus (before influencers, 2007) 

As shit as that whole guru world can be, that guy was like a father to me and taught me everything. Everything I know today at least came from a seed he planted in my young mind.

I worked for him for 7 years, mostly building and ranking blogs so we could generate affiliate commissions, then went on to run all of the SEO for a national entertainment company.

I almost immediately overshot all of my goals there, then one day they fired their PPC agency and asked if I could manage $70k a month. 

I did ‚Äúok‚Äù just as well as the agency at least.

I later went on to run my own projects, and I‚Äôd say I learned the most when I was putting my own hard earned money into Google Ads.

My wife and I started a local cleaning company, I only had like $1500 or so to spare, so I had to make it work.

Still great friends with the guy who taught me back when I was 18 (I‚Äôm 35 now) he‚Äôs basically retired.

No more cleaning company, now I manage ppc for other companies that need leads (no e-commerce)",1704067233.0

Segundo, los cursos, carreras, talleres que hagas dependen de vos y lo que quieras sacar de ah√≠. Yo cuando hice ingenier√≠a electr√≥nica no me esforc√© por conseguir contactos, lo que yo quer√≠a ah√≠ era aprender todo lo que pudiera. Despu√©s cuando cambie de rubro a dev, los contactos los hice trabajando y hablando. Pero siempre tome las etapas de estudio y aprendizaje como aprendizaje. 

Quiz√°s a vos te sirve m√°s aprender solo por otro medio, y las etapas de estudio prefer√≠s usarlas para aprobar con lo justo y sacar contactos de ah√≠, no est√° mal en absoluto. Pero que la universidad o las carreras s√≥lo sirven para hacer contactos, es un pensamiento limitado, como m√≠nimo. Que el t√≠tulo te sirva o no, es otro mundo aparte para otro post. (Yo opino que no sirve a estas alturas jaja)

Pero la realidad de los cursos tipo Coderhouse es que la gente que los organiza le interesa m√°s darte todo el contenido sin importar si lo entendes bien o no, para cumplir con su palabra y tener justificada la guita que les depositan. De ah√≠ en m√°s, queda en vos que haces y como aprendes la info que te dieron, que de por si no es mala, solo que est√° dada a las apuradas.

if the world is literally 6000 years old (not to mention with a literal worldwide flood in the meantime), then God REALLY went out of His way to make it look older than that, and I think that it‚Äôs a touch intellectually lazy to not even entertain the idea that Gen 1-11 could be taken symbolically/allegorically (these chapters are DROWNING in literary symbolism).

We tend to get bogged down in arguments about ‚Äúhow long ‚Äòdays‚Äô were back then,‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe it was just a ‚Äòregional flood‚Äô (despite Gen 7:17-24)‚Äù in order to have our cake and eat it too (that is, in order to take Genesis ‚Äúliterally-ish‚Äù without looking like total fools). I‚Äôm of the opinion that the real value in these episodes, and the theological lessons that God wants to teach us with them, is seeing how they differ from their pagan counterparts about creation ,etc. That is: comparing what the pagans and the Israelites believed about the nature of God and creation, man‚Äôs purpose, the flood‚Äôs purpose (or at least A flood‚Äôs), the nature of evil in the world, etc. etc. I‚Äôm fairly happy to take these chapters almost entirely allegorically, with the possibility that there‚Äôs some long-lost historical facts buried in the mix somewhere, highly filtered through an ancient near-eastern mythological lens.

As a general rule, I don‚Äôt judge a person for being a LITERAL six-day creationist, because they‚Äôre humbling themselves and taking God at His word. But like I said, I think it‚Äôs a touch intellectually lazy to not even entertain the idea of literary/allegorical interpretations to these stories, and you can be an earnest believer with a high view of scripture that takes these chapters at least partially symbolically, and not be a heretic.

All that being said, I admit that if no literal Adam of SOME kind existed, it does seem to create some theological hiccups in the New Testament, especially Romans 5:12-21, changing how literally would understand such passages. Hopefully someone here can add their thoughts.",1704067235.0

An exploit is an unintended feature of a game engine.

Call of Duty's IW engine is based on the third iteration of the Quake Engine (likely why Respawn chose Source as their engine for Titanfall 1) yet Call of Duty's games movement is far more simple and less mechanically intense than other Quake derived games, like Counter Strike and Apex. 

These features have ceased to be exploits and are deliberate parts of game design. Respawn's movement is far faster than the movement of CS:2, as those games have deliberate movement speed limiters (a deliberate design choice as CS:S pre Orange Box didn't have this).",1704067235.0

I had about 4 rounds of accutane treatment one after my first pregnancy at 33 and the other two after my second pregnancy at 40. I didn‚Äôt let my kids suffer like I did. Both got put on it and saved them from more years of pain. My son had cystic acne and waited until he was mid 20‚Äôs to go in accutane because he was nervous of the side effects but they ultimately were not as bad as he thought and both of my kids found it totally worth it‚Ä¶.

"Episcopalian","t5_2ukdr","As a recent convert as well, here's what I have been doing:

I started with the Gospels. I have my own physical copy of the bible, and a digital copy of the Oxford Study Bible. I began with the introductory essays and forewords in that, and then what I would do is read each book of the New Testament ""clean."" By which I mean, just me reading it straight, and trying to understand it for myself. Then, I would go back to the Oxford study bible, and read the introductory essay for that book. It would clarify its origins, literary prose, timeline, and cover a few other details about it.

So first were the Gospels, then Acts, then the letters of Paul, and I am about to finish the other letters and Revelation.

After this I'm going into the Pentateuch, or the first five books. The original Torah. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, following the same pattern. After that I intend to do the Wisdom books, so Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job. Then from there I have yet to determine how I am going to proceed with the rest.

But my general goal here is to read them first, and then study them so as not to risk only coming to my own conclusions and understanding scripture in a vacuum. That's a dangerous road that leads to a lot of wrong, and sometimes insane ideas.

I also recommend taking your book of common prayer every day and giving a shot to dong the morning and evening prayer with the Daily Office lectionary. Every seven weeks or so you'll have read through the Psalms and those are starting to become like clockwork to me, which I enjoy, and I find I keep finding new things to appreciate about them every time through. It also will give you snippets of variety of the OT and NT which, incredibly, will sometimes contextualize the readings you're already doing.

I don't know if this is the best way to do it, or even a good way, but it's been working pretty well for me.",1704067236.0

After 1300 hits, it was cool to see how blood-soaked my character was at the end of the fight (showcased from multiple angles at the end of the video).  
To put this into perspective, earlier this year I completed the hardest no-damage segmented Dark Souls 3 bossfight series (Level 1 with only the starting weapon). The longest bossfights in that series required 400-500 hits over 30-60 minutes (Slave Knight Gael and Demon Prince).",1704067236.0

"Arrangedmarriage","t5_2wyoq","That point about money rings sooo true

I think that‚Äôs why Indians get married so late. All my white friends got married in or right after college, but my Indian relatives are all like 35-40 getting married


I fundamentally don‚Äôt believe you need to be settled in your career with a 6 figure job and house to get married. My husband was a medical student when we got married and we came out stronger than ever especially because I didn‚Äôt marry a doctor, but a hard working man with aspirations.


For me arranged marriage is and will always be the joining of two families and the creation of a new family‚Äî I‚Äôm not trying to have kids at 35 with the chance of my kids coming out with some horrific birth defect or being at retiring age by the time my kid graduates college. 


I am 22 and expecting a child rn and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. I think people buy too much into this dumb stuff of independent living and being care free- when I‚Äôm old I want to have people around me.

I could go on for hours why I don‚Äôt believe you need to be ‚Äúsettled financially‚Äù to have a kid, etc, and that it‚Äôs more about the drive a couple has, but I think India‚Äôs just changing for the worse, and people here on the subreddit are the byproduct of it.

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","The association doesn't come from the book. It comes from people online telling other people that they need to stabilize their dreams, which is false, giving them the impression that lucid dreams are inherrently unstable. This causes issues by associating lucidity with instability, and that association then causes people to have a loss in vividness or premature awakenings. What that commenter says above is not accurate, as it assumes that you have to stabilize lucid dreams, and completely misinterprets the meaning of it. Vividness issues can also be caused by poor dream recall, and can be fixed if noticed while lucid through dream control.",1704067237.0

"ERB","t5_2th4w","As someone who has absolutely no interest in sports, I'm shocked by how enjoyable I've found all three sports battles to be. That said, this one's the weakest of the trilogy, and here's why:

It doesn't justify three verses. There's a lot of great lines here, but there's also a lot of useless fluff that just feels like dead air. I genuinely feel that if you just deleted each of their second verses from this battle it'd be an improvement. It'd be tighter and more consistently high-quality. Hawk's Great One, Wayne bit is good and ideally would be integrated into the first verse in replacement of some of his weaker lines there, but Gretzky's second verse is without value. Just a waste of time.

Beyond that, I think Gretzky's first verse is slow to start(doesn't get good until the net worth line and onwards) and the ""I don't play, Hawkey"" line is concentrated cringe. That said, he easily takes the whole thing by pointing out their score of 183-1. He so thoroughly invalidates Tony Hawk with that one line that it makes me question if this match-up should have happened in the first place. 

It's a solidly good match, it just would have been better if they trimmed the fat. Ali vs. Jordan justified the three verses and kept the momentum going, this one really didn't.

You‚Äôre totally correct it‚Äôs about making it harder for cheat developers, that‚Äôs the entire point of using an ID.

Only the dumbest of people would be willing to go that far to cheat in a video game and they‚Äôd be instantly identifiable with no way of spoofing their identity. 

At the end of the day cheating is a social problem. People are willing to give their ID to a bar or a grocery store clerk for a drink but suddenly when it comes to saving you time playing vs cheaters in a game they spend 100s of hours in, it becomes a risky vector or invasion of privacy (despite the fact they‚Äôre willing to give Ubi their credit card, DOB, name and enough identifying info any serious DB breach would expose them anyways).

OTOH, if you are retiring early, I recommend moving your TSP to a standard IRA provider.  Even better if you can find one with a nice transfer bonus.  We went with Schwab, but also have accounts at Fidelity, Vanguard and Morgan Stanley (under etrade).  Vanguard makes it easiest to see your contributions vs gains.  I'm having a little difficulty finding that easily with Charles Schwab and our accounts at fidelity and etrade aren't IRAs...but etrade has a pretty easy interface to see your gains vs contributions.

(for background: we've had a brokerage with etrade for a long time and just never bothered to move it.  Fidelity seems to be one of the best for your HSA so we moved them there from HSAbank once we early retired from the government.  We put our main TSP into Schwab as a rollover because they seemed to be the most friendly to Expats if we ever decide to move over seas for a few years).",1704067240.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","> green that they never ripen

This is not because they are too green. It is because bananas got exposed to temp below 42¬∞F. The bananas, and all fruit and veg, are still alive after picked. They continue to metabolize starches to sugars. However, bananas are very fragile and if they get too cold they die and turn gray. When this happens they will not ripen, no matter what you do.

Watch out for this in autumn through spring. If bananas are loaded too early or too late into the truck they will get too cold and die.

Produce logistics are lot more complicated than people think.

There was this one time when I was working for a distributor we got a truck that had 2 pallets of mushrooms. The mushrooms were cooking in the tray. The temp recorded showed them temp near the mushrooms was over 120¬∞.  The fridge was on. But there was a lot of rain in Oregon that months so mushrooms were very moist and they went bad like crazy. They were decomposing so fast that if the fridge was not on, the truck would have gone up in flames.'

Michael had me sucking his cock, while one if the other guys decided to fuck me from behind. I like my bisexuality, but I also like my straight side too. I love having sex with women,  just as much as men. I think I would love having sex with someone like yourself. Hell, I might even find myself falling in love  who knows. I did enjoy that night with the others at Michaels, don't get me wrong. But I really think it was the drug that was talking and not really me.

I really want to turn him in for the csam on his phone but I am scared if I am somehow wrong and i misunderstood the situation that I will get into trouble from the police for falsely accusing someone of a crime. I am also really scared of backlash from my family if I turn it in and it's not there as they will see it as further ""proof"" that I'm lying about getting assaulted. even if I do it anonymously, they'll know it was me, unless the police go stealth mode so he's unaware they have sifted through his digital footprint unless they find something incriminating. I also know growing up my dad loved to just video everything of my sister and I growing up on his camera, he has it all stored away on his computer somewhere. I know it's all normal stuff, and from what I have seen, it's mostly wholesome videos from when we were little tbh, but I'm scared he has csam of me and potentially my older sister on there as well. how do police usually handle allegations of csam? are they able to see things a person has looked at even if they have deleted it? will they even care if it's just one photo?",1704067240.0

Part of the reason I say this is because the comments of the Palestinian negotiators were pretty shocking to me, that essentially Jews have zero historical claim to the Temple Mount/Wailing Wall (which heavily implies that their religion and history is complete make-believe). And the fact that the Israelis' ""last, best offer"" was essentially a glorified Bantustan in the West Bank indicates that they simply did not trust Arafat or the Palestinians to enjoy basic things like territorial continuity or control over their own airspace.",1704067241.0

Trans men are a minority. Part of life as a minority is that, oftentimes, members of the majority have little to no meaningful relationships with individuals who are part of a minority. Therefore, they rely on media portrayals to develop a sense of what it means to be a member of that minority. This is why accurate and productive media representation that improves perceptions of the minority group in question is one strategy to secure rights. 

When you look at mainstream media portrayals of trans men (magazine covers, tv show interviews, the most mainstream and accessible media that the average straight/cis person consumes), the representation disproportionately concerns pregnant trans men. In addition to ‚Äúnormies‚Äù, policymakers, doctors, etc. are exposed to these portrayals. As with cis women, they can pass harmful legislation and policies that assumes that *all* trans men wish to be pregnant. 

We see news reports of cis women suffering miscarriages or using contraception and being jailed for ‚Äúmanslaughter‚Äù as these events can terminate an embryo/blastocyst/fetus. We see, throughout history, cis women with cancer/fibroids/endometriosis, etc being denied access to hysterectomy/oophorectomy/other life saving or life improving procedures that involve removing organs associated with female sex characteristics. 

Obviously, T, top surgery, hysterectomy, genital surgery, vnectomy, etc. all have deleterious effects on fertility. It‚Äôs not a huge stretch to imagine further bans or curtailments of FTM transition in particular since, to many onlookers, ‚Äúthey all want to be pregnant anyway.‚Äù Conservatives (actual conservatives, that is) are already looking for any reason to end all medical and legal transition, and the constant portrayal of pregnant ftms gives them an ‚Äúin‚Äù to do so. 

Why are so many trans men gunning for us to have these same health disparities and legal discrimination suffered by cis women?

Additionally, there is no medical research concerning the safety of pregnancy/childbirth/child development of a person conceived from eggs exposed to male levels of T. Afabs are born with all the eggs they will ever produce, and surely a hormone powerful enough to grow facial/body hair, produce prostate cells in the upper part of the v, stop periods, permanently lower the voice, etc. is likely altering the biological state and functioning of the gonads and eggs. For this reason, it‚Äôs my opinion that it is unethical to force a highly medically anomalous circumstance on an infant when a plethora of alternative options (such as delaying medical/legal/social transition until postpartum, if it is absolutely necessary to have a bio kid) are already available.",1704067242.0

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we want post titles to be more descriptive to make it easier for people to know if they might be able to help or not without opening each post.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the music recognition bot(s) in our [Weekly Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/about/sticky?num=2) (this link might only work in a browser)

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era/Year | Genre | Style | Artist type (or name if you know) | Music video information | Source name`  
`Language/Country | Lyrics/Content | Cover art | Description | Possible (or known) song name`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.).
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`When relevant you can also use:`

  - I only remember the melody that I recreated here
  - I only have this recording, don't know any details

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ... by ...? [add the actual details]
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ... by ... [add the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ... by ...?

Thank you and good luck :)

no one (in the empire) would be expecting a group of small fighters to try to engage a freaking dreadnought in the middle of a fleet of destroyers.  and no, they had obviously not learned their lesson from the first death star.

the imperial fleet was designed to fight large cruisers and battleships.  we see several small fighters overtly not splattering on the larger ships shielding throughout the saga.

wasn't it a small fighter that disabled the star destroyer in Rogue One that got pushed into and destroyed the other destroyer to wreck the gate?

You can look at pros who upload their power data for endurance rides. It's almost always under 300 watts average, usually closer to 250 than 300 from what I've seen.

Yeah, I hoped it is not a big issue (Gurk actually allows targeting fully healed characters in combat as well i.e), as you see the HPs of the selected character, and - as mentioned - this engine allows for item to heal or restore above the max value, so the solution is not that straightforward.",1704067245.0

I always track my hours and the task at hand. So I know exactly how long each task takes me. You get faster over time, but that isn‚Äôt something to give a discount on.

>What do you think happened in berlin? Everyone tried to go to the west.

I agree that East germany was poorer than West Germany and that the Berlin wall was a pretty bad idea, But before the war the East of Germany was already poorer than the west of Germany, since the industrial heartland of Germany was in the Rhineland, another factor that made East Germany poorer was the US sanctions, aswell as the USSR not being able to help Germany since they had to rebuild their own country first, while West Germany could get all the aid they wanted from the US since they were unaffected by the war, West Germany received 1.4 billion dollars in aid just in the first 4 years after the war.

"EndTipping","t5_39v0t","These companies partner with charities for free advertising. St. Jude gets their donations from a huge customer base, and Wal-Mart gets advertised on all of their content for being a corporate sponsor. Win-win. 

The average person doesn't care or give the slightest second then after tapping ""no"". You're in the fringe minority for going out of your way to complain about it. 

Labor is typically also a business's largest expense, so the idea they can just dole out an extra $10/hour is crazy. They can't take that hit. They would be forced to raise prices, which would advantage their competitors. Also, servers in states where their employers aren't allowed to count tips against their minimum wage *still* expect tips. $10/hour more is nothing to most of these people. That's like 1 table's tip. 

As far as not being able to ""afford a fucking house"". You can go down the road of self pity and blaming capitalism/evil greedy whoever or whatever -- or you can realize you're positioned better than almost everyone in human history before you to make a considerable amount of money and live a very comfortable life.

Number of block trades 10k to 50k were much much higher, still a lot of money per trade. For stocks with these small prices, to buy in with 100k may be setting new bottoms at a price‚Ä¶ 5-10% above. On big downer days like this, i‚Äôm betting they‚Äôre hoping to get all 15% plus whatever else comes after some settling around that number. They can handle goin down a bit more first yeah (loss risk) but I doubt thats what they see in the overall going forward.

"synthesizers","t5_2rdyc","I have one of these and love it, they're awesome, congrats and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do mine.

Mine gets a lot of use - it's perfect for just messing around with as it has onboard sounds, most of the sounds kinda suck but.. who cares. It's fun.

It's got an arpeggiator. It can be used as a MIDI controller - got dials and pads you can assign so you can use it to control software synths or whatever you like.

I've even used mine in conjunction with Loopy Pro on iPad, for some things. Love the thing.

I've got 2 problems with it - I wish it had a 6.5mm jack, it's only got the little one and I'm not super keen on using that for onboard sounds into a PA for live work at all. Otherwise, I'd actually consider it for use because some of the drum sounds are perfectly usable, and it's obviously got pads, so you could loop drums or whatever.. and some of the sounds are solid, there's an electric piano sound in there that's nice enough.

They're just general MIDI sounds as far as I understand it, but they don't \*all\* suck.

..and no MIDI in/out makes it totally useless for hooking up to other devices, I would love to be able to connect it to other keys/synths but, you can't use it this way.

Those two issues don't affect the fun I have with it - love playing around with it, love the form factor, and I find it super cool as a MIDI controller, but messing with it's own sounds is cool too.",1704067246.0

"climatechange","t5_2rawx","It is an individual problem if everyone lived in huts together and lived off the land you would be right but we live in building that use wood, concrete, steel, heat ourselves to levels that are above what's needed to be comfortable, eat too much etc. The things needed to let us survive have grown and the energy requirements for that has grown as well.

Now if we force countries that haven't grown at the same rate and can't sustain themselves with local resources to a c02 emissions pledge then that will kill people. Say we stop all transportation of goods on huge shipping container ships and make everyone rely on themselves people will not be able to account for it In too short a span. Essentially you would be pushing down others to protect yourself.

So ultimately you have to accept things as a necessary evil in order to get as many people to live while bringing up their standards of living and education. 

So in the end everything is done because we want to save as many people as possible, right? I imagine you believe this and why you care about it, but you're looking too far into the future and not looking in front of you. So things like oil and coal will be needed by humanity as a whole in order to prevent deaths.

Paradoxically trees are a part of the problem right now because as climate change brings more extreme temperatures and creating dryer conditions forests will inevitably burn, whether through human intervention or natural causes. So the best way to combat this is to build as many things from wood and cycle through like lumber harvesters in order to sequester c02 into the wood and into the final product which will decay eventually into a natural product that the earth can absorb. Concrete and steel on the other hand emit massive amounts of c02 for their production. So in order to keep c02 down the forests need to be culled so they don't destroy themselves much like what we do with animals.

The next part of the problem is people with their need to feel good about their choice. Sometimes the thing that's right isn't the thing that feels good but it's the only choice you have. Nuclear power is one of those things as well as hydro electricity. Overall these offer the lowest impact to the environment, it's just that it's a big impact in the short term, nuclear not so much and is pretty safe and great all around but people get nervous from chernobyl.

The left loved Elon musk before, his goals haven't changed and he's accomplishing more and more things he sets out to do, I hated the guy before but now I can't deny what he's doing is good. The left however have done an about face because his personal beliefs don't align with their own so even if something good can be done if it doesn't make some people feel good they hate it.

So because of all of that it is collectively an individual problem. People in the higher end of income and status will lorde their morals over those below and get angry at those above  and in the end will morph whatever personal fear or goal in their mind as altruistic and without their own ego in mind.

""Respect yourself"" and variations on the theme are phrases almost always used in attempts to modify a woman's behaviour - and, more specifically, a woman's behaviour with regard to sex and sex-adjacent activities - through shame. How we dress, how we speak, whether we drink/how much we drink/where we go to drink, how we dance ... and, of course, how often and with whom we have sex. And therein lies the issue: women are expected to adhere to all these standards because, inferentially, men are little better than animals in rut and they will indulge themselves howsoever (and with whomsoever) they please; we should expect no more or less from men than the most basic id-driven impulses to find shelter, eat, and sleep with any and every willing woman who comes into view.

Most countries don‚Äôt have an entire movement dedicated to them being an ethnostate, but there are some that do.

However again, there is no ‚ÄúIsrael shouldn‚Äôt exist‚Äù movement that isn‚Äôt among a small sect of extremists.

True radical love, one might say, begins when empathy breaks down, or our feelings and understanding cannot match the problem we face. We cannot have empathy if we do not understand the other, cannot feel with the other, etc.

That is where liberalism ends and cannot go any further.

We must go for something more radical, where empathy cannot go.",1704067249.0

One thing that has helped me deal with shame is the realization that the average person has not only had a lot of personal failures and made a lot of mistakes, but that there is a wide range of these things. Some are relatively harmless and innocent, just examples of folks being too hard on themselves, and others are downright criminal and horrible, and yet they continue to live their lives. Everyone has skeletons in the closet, and yet they still act (at least on the surface) like they are worth giving a chance and try to pursue their own happiness throughout life by building relationships, establishing hobbies, and taking care of needs. 

There is no reason for why that can't be for you. No matter what you do, you still have to believe you're worth being alive. No matter what mistake or fault, it does not matter what it is, you have a right to be here. You \*belong\* here.",1704067250.0

DECEMBER | ANIME | HOORAY
--------|-----|------
Arknights S2 | 7/10 | Much like the first season, a little rocky, but the GREAT episodes knocked it out of the park
Hand Shakers | 2/10 | well it lived up to its reputation
How Do You Live? | -/10 | Leaving it blank until¬†I decide ~~how to live~~ how to sort it out but it absolutely gets my vote for best visuals of the year
Kara no Kyoukai 5-10 (rewatch) | 6-9/10 | srry for dropping out of the rewatch I genuinely didn't even have time to post at the end. anyway, 5 still the GOAT, I still don't care much for 7 tbh, Mirai Fukuin still the GOAT
Interstella5555 | 7/10 | space rock fashion yes
Pokemon Concierge | 8/10 | chill stop motion Pokemon will save me. I need 100 seasons
Pokemon: Paldean Winds | 7/10 | Pokemon yes
Texhnolyze | 8.5/10 | Texh's most incredible aspects are its sound design and soundtrack that transfigure the heartwrenching, ghostly fragility of its world and protagonist into nearly-tactile feeling. For that reason I think my favorite stretch of episodes is still the first few, however the final stretch is equally gorgeous

Most likely it is meters per second, but it could be inches per second, or yards, or football fields.

Inherent Renewal: The user might possess an inherent ability to self-heal or rejuvenate, making them resilient in battle and able to recover from injuries rapidly.

Usage Examples:

Tactical Adaptation: In the midst of a battle, the user could renew themselves to gain resistance to specific types of attacks or to better match the strengths of their opponent.

Undercover Operations: When engaging in undercover activities, the user could alter their appearance and blend seamlessly into different environments.

Skill Acquisition: The user might renew themselves to gain proficiency in a new skill or to enhance existing skills, adapting to changing circumstances.

Power Variety: For versatility, the user could switch between different elemental powers or abilities, surprising opponents and keeping them off balance.

Weaknesses:

Limited Renewals: The user might have a finite number of renewals before requiring a cooldown period, preventing constant changes.

Energy Consumption: Each renewal could consume a significant amount of the user's energy, leading to fatigue or exhaustion.

Temporary Changes: Renewals may only last for a limited long duration, requiring the user to renew periodically to maintain specific alterations.

Vulnerability During Renewal: The user might be vulnerable during the renewal process, as they undergo changes and adaptations.

Finite Cooldown: The user only has a large cool down until their next renewal.",1704067252.0

A legendary Dragon's Wrath longsword deals 1d8+3d6+6+2+3 or 26 damage. That is a difference of 15 damage *per hit*, before factoring any feat or other ability that only works in melee. 

If you are a two-handed character, you are looking at 1d8+6 or 10,5 (note that this is less than an one-handed javelin with dueling!) vs 2d6+3d6+6+3 (reroll all 1s and 2s) or approximately 29 damage, before adding in things like Great Weapon Master. That is a difference of almost 19 damage per hit. On critical hits, the damage difference is even bigger. 

Also, a Tasha summon deals something like 1d8+11 or 16.5 damage with its ranged attacks at 8th level or 1d8+17 or 21.5 if you are a necromancy wizard, and makes four of those. 

On the other hand, if you are an archer, you deal 1d8+3d6+6+3 with each of your attacks, no matter how far you are away from your enemy. Even when you are in melee with them, you still deal that amount of damage (and can get rid of the disadvantage with Crossbow Expert or Gunner).",1704067253.0

It's more than just a needle; it's a relic of my musical odyssey. Now, faced with the task of finding a replacement, I stand at a crossroads. Stick with the trusted brand, or explore new sonic frontiers with a different needle?

So, fellow Redditors, have you experienced the sorrow of a broken record needle? How did you cope?

"dating","t5_2qhb1","I think a big part of it is that men and women IN GENERAL gravitate toward different categories of things as hobbies.

IN GENERAL men like things. They like to tinker, to build, to fix, whatever. That's the car you're talking about, or the military documents, or the fishing or the stock market. They're things to be worked on or analyzed or whatever.

IN GENERAL women like people-oriented things and more social or nurturing self-love hobbies. Taylor Swift, crime shows, skincare, or as someone else mentioned below, dancing and clubbing. 

THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS!!! But anyway, this is why men and women don't really ""get"" each other's hobbies. And my theory is that, just as an extrovert looks at an introvert and thinks they're boring sticks in the mud because they don't want to go out, so might a woman who sees her man prefer to work on a passion project on a Friday night rather than go out dancing with friends.",1704067253.0

As for card fees I agree that they are wya too high in the US, I am Eu based and here there is a cap on how much card processing payments like Amex and visa can profit from businesses, that's also why we have bad rewards compared to Americans, they can't charge much to companies, if you aoy with a debit card they can only charge 20-30 cents, that's IMO a fair value for the benefit they provide in cash handling savings",1704067253.0

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","First of all crowning any abilities is entirely optional. I would get talents that contribute to DPS to 9 but if you want to save your crowns that's entirely viable.

Bennett wants to be LV90 and his burst Lv9 or 10. For his weapon you only care about base ATK Skyward Blade has a base ATK of 608 the only weapons that would be better than it are The Alley Flash, Mistsplitter Reforged and Aquila Favonia. For his artifacts 4p Noblesse with ER Sands is usually the go-to since he wants as much ER as possible. ER/HP/HB if you care about healing or ER/Pyro/Crit if you want him to deal damage.

Kazuha wants to maximize his EM to provide the highest DMG% buff possible. His talents actually dont matter at all since the majority of his damage contribution will be from Swirl reactions. 4p VV with EM/EM/EM + Iron Sting is his optimal F2P setup as long as you get enough ER to do the rotation. The only notable upgrades for him would be Xiphos' Moonlight or Freedom-sworn.

Xiangling doesnt require Lv90. The stat boost from 80 to 90 isnt a significant increase. I do recommend getting refinements for The Catch since the R5 stat bonus is very good for her. 4p EOSF is usually the go-to nowadays as the domain is more efficient to farm than CW and XL wants a lot of ER. If possible ATK/Pyro/Crit gives you more damage, but ER/Pyro/Crit can be viable if you dont meet ER requirements otherwise.

Get up Bennett first, then complete your Kazuha and lastly improve XL.",1704067254.0

"AskMeuf","t5_7w45e4","Hello. Il faut que tu aies une discussion avec lui et que tu lui dises clairement que ce n‚Äôest plus possible: ¬´¬† Je sais que ta situation est difficile mais tu ne fais aucun effort pour t‚Äôen sortir. Cela fait 3 ans que √ßa dure et moi je ne me vois pas dans 15 ans devoir vivre avec une petite retraite et continuer √† tout faire dans cet maison. J‚Äôaimerai que l‚Äôon mette en place un plan pour que tu ailles mieux et que tu t‚Äôy tienne. Je n‚Äôai plus envie d‚Äô√™tre ton porte monnaie donc je te donne un an pour te sortir de cette mauvaise passe. 

Premi√®rement, tu vas r√©cup√©rer des cheques psy et commencer une th√©rapie. (l‚Äô√©tat aide avec 8 seances de memoire, donc √† raison d‚Äôun rdv par semaine il a deux mois de therapie gratuite.)

Deuxi√®mement, une fois que ces cheques psy sont utilis√©s, je veux que tu cherches un travail meme alimentaire √† temps partiel. Cette situation n‚Äôest plus soutenable pour moi. J‚Äôai besoin d‚Äôaide financi√®rement et je n‚Äôen plus que tout repose sur moi.

Troisi√®mement, tu vas commencer √† faire tes taches m√©nag√®res. Chaque semaine on ajoutera ensemble une ou deux taches pour que cela soit progressif pour toi et que je me sente aid√©e.

Es-tu d‚Äôaccord?¬†¬ª

S‚Äôil dit non, ne reste pas. Tu ne deviendras pas plus jeune. Peu importe combien tu l‚Äôaimes, tu vas finir malheureuse √† 70 ans, √† devoir faire toutes les taches et √† gal√®rer financi√®rement. 

La d√©pression est une maladie mais tu as assez donn√© de ta personne. S‚Äôil ne souhaite pas avoir le d√©clic pour s‚Äôen sortir, tu n‚Äôas pas √† rester avec lui. Il y a un homme dehors qui t‚Äôaiderait et ne te ferait jamais cela. 

Je sais que c‚Äôest difficile. J‚Äôai v√©cu avec une personne d√©pressive et j‚Äôai d√ª le quitter. 6 mois - un an apr√®s il est revenu, avait fait du psy et maintenant m‚Äôaide au quotidien et ne se cache plus derri√®re sa d√©pression pour tout se permettre. Bien sur j‚Äôai eu le meilleur sc√©nario. Je ne l‚Äôai pas attendue quand je l‚Äôai quitt√© alors que nous etions ensemble depuis 5 ans. J‚Äôai vu d‚Äôautres hommes pour mon plaisir personnel, j‚Äôai v√©cu et j‚Äôai vu que plus jamais je n‚Äôautoriserai un homme √† me traiter comme il l‚Äôa fait.

Choisis toi s‚Äôil ne souhaite pas changer. C‚Äôest deja assez difficile de vieillir et de planifier sa retraite, tu n‚Äôas pas besoin d‚Äôun poids lourd. Bon courage!",1704067254.0

Give MG to Castellan for a mid game reposition. The other Castigator can stay as a bruiser but right now Canis Rex is basically an auto take. I'd consider dropping Lancer altogether to keep one Castigator. Banner Castigator  Canis can do a lot of range and melee bruising.

That aside, I looooooove them and can't wait to wear them! I might still grab a pair of comfy runners or something I can put my orthotics in just as backup for later in the night but I'm optimistic I'll last awhile in these!

2. Obviously

3. Buu duo yes, 23 piccolo is still good

4. Clearly

5. Maybe a little less. Idk how many units are in dokkan but let's say we have 1500 units, at least 50 of them are good so it's a bit more than 1%

6. Depends on the condition. Transformation should be used to give us incredibly busted units that would break the game if they started out already transformed. Also cool animations

7. Of course 

8. Yes

9. Kinda

10. Yes but with good rng you can win even if you're braindead. The more strategy you use the less the rng gets involved but it can still end a perfect run even if your strategy is impeccable.

11. Agl ss duo has never been good and people shit on that unit since release, nothing new. Cooler was very good but he came during the switch to defense heavy meta so he couldn't really shine",1704067255.0

From the images in the above link, create NAT policies and firewall rules pointing to the synology reverse proxy settings that will be setup next.

On the synology, setup the reverse proxy and point to the HDhome run. 

In plex, setup the public IP or DDNS where the HD Home Run is and bobs your uncle.

"adhdwomen","t5_31aao","I can relate to this. I was on meds for about a year (adderall) then stopped about 2 years ago. I can‚Äôt really put my finger on what exactly though - so maybe it‚Äôs actually just a feeling? 

Maybe the feeling is a little extra self forgiveness? Medication did actually help me not wait until the absolute last minute to work on an important project. Now I wait until the last minute unmedicated, but I know if I was medicated I wouldn‚Äôt be doing that. So I‚Äôm not a bad person or lazy or stupid for doing it. I also gained a new appreciation for the gun to my head. I‚Äôm much more creative and put out better work when I‚Äôm not medicated and I have my gun. 

That said, I‚Äôve heard that Vynase may be better for some people so I may look into that because relying on the gun isn‚Äôt good for my health and also usually triggers binge eating. 

I hadn‚Äôt gotten this clarity about why I feel better post medication while being unmedicated, so thanks for asking the question!",1704067256.0

The only things i know about her condition is she had a heart operation a few years ago, she‚Äôs on hormones and hasn‚Äôt started her period yet but they‚Äôre hopeful she eventually will. She also looks exactly the same as she did when she was 11-12, but she doesn‚Äôt let that affect her from letting herself feel more mature in her body. 

As an adoptee, I‚Äôve got to say, you keeping those objects is be more than enough to prove to me you wanted and love that baby, think about her and miss her. Accepting that you cannot give your child the best life must hurt, but you‚Äôve done a wonderful thing for her making sure she will have people who can. My only note on the closed adoption, would be to potentially to reach out to the adoptive parents and make yourself available for if she ever needs blood, a potential kidney donor from your family would likely be a better match as well. Not having someone like that for me gave me a great amount of anxiety growing up, but if she knows there‚Äôs someone there it may help calm her own future nerves towards her syndrome.",1704067257.0

"LandCruisers","t5_2so8z","> Why is it not selling?

A petrol, Auto 80 series is the least desirable combination for one. 1FZ is a good motor but it loooves to down the petrol. 

Second reason will be you don't have a roadworthy. That will put a lot of people off. Someone has to get a roadworthy when you transfer registration, so if I am a buyer and I look at a short-time traveller selling it 'as is' without a roadworthy, I am not going to have a lot of faith that you have kept up with maintenance.

If you're in Melbourne and you're advertising in Sydney, of course you won't get a lot of interest. That's to be expected. 

It's also a time not a lot of people buy... they're on holidays, they're spending cash on trips on presents. 

I do wonder as well if you'd have more luck selling it without the 'gear'.

It's a pretty specific buyer that will want it all decked out with the stuff, a lot of people like customising it to their own liking. 

You've basically turned it into a very specific purpose vehicle - with only 2 seats, not a lot of cargo room. Someone has to want to immediately go travelling and sleeping in the vehicle. So you're excluding the family buyer. 

Do you have the rear seats? Can you take all the 'stuff' out? 

IMO if you waited till end of Jan, got a RWC, had the ability to photograph it with rear seats and drawers taken out - I think you'll get more hits.",1704067258.0
"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","Maybe they'll have something better later but as of now here is what I do to get enough people for shadow raids.

1. set a flare in compfire 15 minutes before the raid even started (in the egg form). This to inform people that the raid will starts in 15 minutes. If you set a flare when the raid is already active. People a bit further away would not come, because they don't know when you are going to start
2. only doing shadow raids that are indoors and in a busy area like inside a mall. Nobody likes to wait outside especially in winter. So they might not come. If it is indoor, it is more likely to attract player around

I have nobody to play with and on some weekend, I would go to a nearby mall and just by doing the above, I got all three shadow birds in the last 3 months and even got shiny articuno and shiny zapdos.",1704067258.0

"alaska","t5_2qhft","I'm a teacher in the public schools here in Alaska. I've worked in big city schools and little rural schools. Honestly, I think the most important part of going to regular schools is not academic but the social aspect. Like all the social issues your kid is finding - it's about finding out how to deal with them and live with other people when they grow up. Are a lot of the teachers and schools and students bad? Sure they are. But you're learning those social skills.

So homeschooling is huge in Alaska and there are great programs, just because so many people are in isolated areas. I see kids from homeschooling go to sports in regular schools, for example. So it can be good, but if it's because the kid is getting bullied, that doesn't really fix the problem. Anyway, I'm sure you know your situation better than me, but that's my two cents.",1704067258.0

"GuitarAmps","t5_2u7ul","Started out with a Roland DAC-15 with a very small, tinny speaker, that my parents got me in the mid '90s.

Began playing with a band the early' 00s. Didn't have an amp, but their previous guitar player had left his Carlsbro 100w Twin Channel Power Amp at their practice space. Used that one until I bought it off of him.

A few years later I bought a Vox Valvetronix AD120VTX for some insurance money I got after a knee injury. Great amp! 

Got an Orange Crush 35LDX practice amp from my girlfriend, now wife, when I turned 30. It was good, but not great, and eventually I sold it. Girlfriend-now-wife didn't approve. üòÇ

After a very long break from playing guitar, I traded the Carlsbro and the Vox Valvetronix in at a store and bought an Orange AD30TCH. The AD30 wasn't exactly what I wanted, so I returned it and got an Orange TH100, that I used in various bands for many years.

Around this time I had a Vox AC15C1. Great amp! 

Sold the TH100 down the line to fund an Orange Rocker 30. Amazing amp!

Bought a Fender Hot Rod Deluxe from my brother. It was modded with a Celestion G12H-75 Creamback after the original speaker gave out. Amazing pedal platform. 

Also has an Orange Pedal Baby 100 for while. 

Sold the Rocker 30 to fund a Victory VX100 Super Kraken, that I still own and use with my band.

Got an Orange Rockerverb 100 Mk III a year later. Probably my dream amp. Still have this one. 

And a year later I bought an EVH 5150 III 50W Stealth. Also still have this one.",1704067258.0

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","Best to not start if you haven't. If you did, best to decrease and ideally eliminate. I have done so and feel so much better energy wise and better sleep. The current scientific literature suggests no amount is safe. Sure you can get resverotrol from red wine, but having a handful of blueberries will give you more antioxidants without the negatives. 

I've read some literature that the only safe alcohol if you decide to do so would be gin or tequila because they have been linked to a better breakdown in the CYP450 detox pathway compared to other alcohols, but again no damage is better than some damage. 

Something to consider is asking your gf to join you in it. It becomes difficult to have a partner that continues to want to drink when you don't want - and it can lead to conflict (as it has with me and my wife). 

I try to make her informed about the negatives of alcohol and she has reduced it down, but still has it daily and wonders why her health is bad. 

If you make it a shared objective, it would be easier for you to stay consistent when you're both on the same page. Good luck my friend",1704067258.0

I will say I am in a similar spot where, as the COO of our company, was asked to step down and be the girlfriend. It hurt, a lot. I‚Äôm trying to be respectful and understanding. It is hard sometimes. 

I own 23% of the company and am debating if I want a seat on the board. I am also debating if there is a role that could possibly be a bit of a step back but keep me on the team (like community outreach or something). 

If you already put in your sweat equity, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fair to ask for part of the company. 50% is steep, but it depends on the company structure. If the company will ever look for investors, maybe 50% isn‚Äôt reasonable? 

The alternative side would be leave that company and start your own from home. What is your passion? Ask if he will fund that and set that home office up (or art studio or streaming space).

"Dragonballsuper","t5_380mp","People who say that Goku is beyond the tiering system in terms of power.

Liteally, all of the dick inhalers say this goes to the ""Beyond Dimensionality"" hyperbole statement that was used once to describe the afterlife.

That doesn't even make sense in a dragon ball standpoint. If Goku is beyond boundless, what the fuck does that make people like Beerus? Omnipotent+? What about Zeno? Is he Omnipotent++++? 


The one that Goku directly stated to him that easily goes to him is when he said that meditation isn't a form of training, when he say Jiren do it during the tournament of power and was constantly doing it to learn Ultra Instinct. Hell, how the hell does Goku forget that one most trained their mind and body when he said this directly after fighting Broly?

> Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and **the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy.** This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

Yes. The wording implies that you can attempt to lie to a corpse or disguise yourself to get more favorable answers from *speak with dead*. It seems like this actually works better than trying to reason with it.

Your DM will probably rule that the corpse has the same modifiers it had in life.",1704067259

It's hard to go no contact in my situation, and I've been trying to keep the peace to keep the environment calm for our kid.  That also means I'm holding a lot in.  Your journal idea is a really good idea. I want to give it a try!  How are you able to make sure he doesn't have access to it?  I think he would go in a rampage if he discovers it.  I really want to do it though bc I feel I have too much pent up inside.

Your advice about having my own bank account gives me a confidence boost.  I've been wanting to do it, but I'm too scared.  He's the one that files the taxes for our household, so he really has eyes on all the financials.  I'm not sure if I'm ready yet, but I realize it is something I will have to do.

I've been trying to document everything, but I don't know how much it will help.  Sometimes it doesn't seem like a big deal or I can't describe the way it was.  I'm just hoping that the more I document, the more someone can understand the whole situation.   He's been telling our kid about things I've been doing wrong, like letting the garbage can get full, not wiping up pancake batter on the stovetop, etc.  He tried to gaslight me in front of her, and when I stood firm, he tried to tell our kid that I was being ""silly"" and rolled his eyes. She actually realized it was wrong for him to do that and told him so.  I got punished hard for that.  It's situations like this that make me feel I can't deal with parallel parenting. I'm scared and worried. I felt horrible that our kid went through that.

I'm really thankful for your advice. Some reinforced what I'm already doing, so I feel like I'm on the right track, some are new advice that I will learn from. Although it still feels extremely hard, but it helps. Thank you again!",1704067260.0

I remember in Buddhism it's taught that there is always some level of nihilism in people who don't believe in an afterlife. Whats the point if none of what we do persists onwards after death.

"TeamfightTactics","t5_1136aw","Would pivot, but not immediately. Tahm is not very good, all your units is 1 star. Or you could just sell the 4 cost and build econ. Since you're streaking somehow, maybe the other boards are weak. But that would mean you're commiting and you still need to sell tahm. 

So in my head I would probably have 3 options for myself:  
1. Sell the 4 cost and build econ (very forceful) but it could help in a few more rounds.  
>Might be able to level to 8. And improve your lead.  
2. Sell tahm and try building kata country or samira country.  
3. Try forcing around EDM jax moshers.

Samira 3\* is kinda good if you get some executioners, or kata crowd diver is also good. With samira you might be able to build executioners and fucc the other guys building karthus and akali. With kata crowd divers you might be able to get some yone and zed and fucc over the EDM moshers/3\* yone guys.

Sometime I think its good to further add to the contest as it would mean you get to limit their progression but further your strength by building the uncontested one.  You could also build country moshers as evident in the image, but i would think that would suck as you said moshers were already contested.

You might have directly/indirectly communicated that to them at some point, thus they know that you will hate the thing where they are planning to go. And thus they don't invite you as they try to avoid you accepting it out of preassure and then just being miserable there (and would put their mood down as they see that you are miserable and will feel guilty that you came because of them).

If you hear them planning something that is interesting to you - don't be afraid to ask them if you could join. They might not see any problem with it and invite you.",1704067261.0

Like it has been a while since I saw it but even in the shield hero, the weird stuff comes after he buys raph, when he is actually buying her it is portrayed as more of a necessity and I Don't remember him loving the idea of having to buy one. I think it's an OK trope since it would be something that most medieval style fantasy worlds might have, but it either needs to be: 1 the protagonist freeing the slave (NOT buying her to free them), 2 it being a necessity like in the shield hero since no one wants to be in his party due to his reputation, or 3) comedy, like in how not to summon a demon lord",1704067262.0

"furry","t5_2qi2h","Dissecting exact wording is fun for me, so here we go:

> Why would someone be talking about a severed fox tail and not being an anthro (the obvious meaning of what OP was trying to say) in a FURRY subreddit??

You say ""obvious"", but OP writes ""Would I need to cover a fox tail if it was real"", the ""if it was *real*"" part implying that it being fake is more likely, so they had to specify. This already points to them not having a tail and using an attachable one. Real animal tails, which extremely uncommon in fursuiting and furry costuming in general, aren't too uncommon in non-furry costuming, like Ren Fest outfits. A severed fox tail is something a person could easily own, as weird as that sounds. If they meant an anthro with a natural tail, they probably would have just said ""would I need to cover my tail"" or something.

I'd say OP is asking the *Furry* subreddit because we'd know better than anyone who to theoretically cover an animal part, as many of us have posed the question for fun. Our whole world revolves around animals in human-based situations, so something like ""how do you account for tails/ears/muzzles/wings"" is a common question.

Lastly, and this one isn't as a strong a point but still worth noting, OP talks in first person, whereas if they meant their fursona or a furry character in general, you'd be much more likely to specify that, not just say I or me. ""Would *my fursona* need a hair net"" fits much better.

Also, side note, they replied to me saying to leave their tail at home if they meant them as a real person by saying ""I don't have one and I would leave it at home if I had one"" and not mentioning the part about an anthro. That right there tells me they mean a real world person with a fox tail.",1704067262.0

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei","I think Bravely Default is one of my favorite RPGs ever, with a frankly bonkers direction for the story to go, quality of life stuff for grinding and random encounter frequency, and a job system that I do not think has been done better, except arguably in its own mini-series.

However, the game, starting in chapter 5, gets into a truly unfotunate snag in the story that has *strongly* turned off even people who liked the game immensely up to that point. In chapter 5, >!the party seems to have travelled back in time to before the crystals were fixed, and have to basically repeat the journey at rapid speed (none of the story stuff blocking the crystals is back, so you can fly right to them) and repeat all the crystal guardian bosses. And then it happens again in chapter 5, 6, 7, and 8.!<. There *is* neat stuff that happens in the story during those doldrums. In fact, it's during that part that the most interesting twist in the story happens. But that segment can get so repetitive (the worst parts are the mandatory ones, and the cool shit is almost all optional) that it's got people to hang up the game entirely at that point.

I love the game, but I wouldn't recommend it without the big asterisk of that segment of the story. If you can muscle through it, or enjoy it, then yeah the game is awesome. But it's a hard sell because of that.",1704067262.0

If you went Honda I‚Äôd take the Acura route and find something better 2008-2014. TL specifically or you can look at the TLX. 2001-2008 like the fucking plague. 

Avoid Nissan and ford. 

Looking for a hatchback? Hate to say this but look into the Buick encore 2017-2019. Main issues would have been pistons and that was rectified by 2017. 

Want something newer and sporty? I have a 17‚Äô regal GS and so far put 30,000 miles in a bad driveshaft/awd system caused by an accident. Disabled the system by pulling a stupid fuse. No fuss. Great car. Bulletproof. Put a hole in the oil pan and shut the engine down in time before the oil leaked out. Still going strong. Their 2.0L Turbos are great..better if you stick to premium gas. 


Economical but want some features? 2017-2019 Chevy Cruze. 40+mpg at times and has it all. Use premium gas if you went for a 2017 model.

"BeamNG","t5_2wf1e","Well you are wrong about the FFB in BeamNG being bad, and especially about BeamNG simulating driving worse as a whole, but I can probably explain why you think this. 

It's a complex topic but BeamNG feels worse out of the box because everything's physically modeled, and thus the cars actually need to be setup well to not only handle good, but also make good force feedback, and by default very few if any cars in BeamNG are actually setup well or at least anywhere close to the peak of what they're capable of, and very few feel good on wheel as a result. 

In AC, the cars are generally setup quite well by default, and on top of that the ffb by default just works great, as a result of the presets they have for pretty much every wheel  that's out there, plus they also do various things to fake/boost certain aspects of the ffb to make it feel more ""natural"", even though that ffb is technically very unrealistic. 

Ultimately I've driven a lot in both games, and since BeamNG's physics are significantly better, the game at its absolute best is incredible to drive, but those physics also mean that cars are extremely sensitive in terms of alignment and things like stiffness and dampening, the ffb will essentially feel like shit unless everything's perfect, but when it's perfect, it changes everything. 

Meanwhile in AC, even a poor setup's ffb gets boosted into something that feels decent pretty much no matter what, and since they've also made a preset on top of that to ensure it especially feels decent on your specific wheel, the game as a whole will feel great all the time on wheel. 

You also don't have to deal with suspension limitations in AC, BeamNG's suspension modeling being real allows the entire suspension structure to bend, which means that when you increase the spring rate on double wishbone suspension for instance, more forces will be transmitted into the upper and lower arms, stretching and compressing them more, and that essentially makes those into a spring that you cannot dampen, which will make the car hop through corners. And you can make that specific issue worse in a bunch of different ways, adding wheel offset for instance will greatly increase this effect, and while it's usually fine on extra strong race suspension, if you do it to stock suspension, it will make the car handle worse. 

That level of detail, that makes BeamNG's simulation so much more dynamic, is the kind of thing AC can't even begin to simulate properly at least to my knowledge, and that makes BeamNG the better sim, and when things are setup well, I think it makes BeamNG drive better. 

This is all not to say that BeamNG's not got it's problems and isn't missing things, especially for racing, however since these days things like tire thermals, tire wear, drafting, and laser scanned tracks straight from AC, are all easily something you can download for free straight from the official repository, and BeamMP exists, a lot of people's complaints are no longer valid whatsoever, and if you can't have fun in a driving sandbox that's this limitless, idk what to say.",1704067263.0

There are huge mental and physical benefits to adopt regular, meaningful training in your life for 1.5 years. When you stop for two months for surgery, you don't start all over. Your bounce-back rate will be much faster than if you continued being sedentary for the next 1.5 years. It's also likely that you'll recover faster too, because you're in a more robust physical and mental state than one who's been sedentary.

"mormon","t5_2qky2",">I've looked into the Bill Reel claim about the plane story. Reel came up with something that creates doubt about what Pres. Nelson said, but it is a weak argument at best. There are many other explanations than what Reel provided for what could have happened.

I have no idea what Bill's argument is, but I can say as someone with years of aviation experience and who has read too many incident reports, that Nelson's plane story is so fantastical that it's utterly unbelievable. And the evidence shows that what actually happened is a whole different story than the one he tells. I don't mean to hijack the thread but with my background, this story is my biggest pet peeve regarding Nelson.

&#x200B;

>Pres. Nelson has live a long life of success and accomplishment. That should speak very loudly to anyone who is paying attention.

Also to comment on this. You do realize that there have been many immoral, and dare I say evil people, who have accomplished more and had more success than Nelson. This idea of a prosperity gospel, that Nelson's success and accomplishment are indications of his righteousness, is false doctrine according to the church.

- 38% of respondents in China used a public bike share system. Most countries are in the single digits (we are 4%)
- For short trips (less than 1 mile or 2km) 65% of Brits would walk (vs 36% Aussies), 47% of Americans would drive (40% of Aussies) and 24% of Malaysians would ride a motorbike (2% of Aussies)

"Hanklights","t5_3ugk08","I picked Cerakoting up as a hobby not too long ago. My first project was a firearm, instead of paying \~$250 to have it done, I decided to spend that money on tools and materials to try it myself. That larger purchases are an air compressor, blasting cabinet, and shop vac with dust collector. Cheaper HVLP spray guns work fine for small projects, but over time I invested in something nicer and it has made a huge difference in making the finished product look more professional.

I follow the general guidelines Cerakote recommends but here is some of my process:

1. Disassemble - remove bezels, switch rings, o- rings, optics. Sometimes I remove the PCB and driver, though that can add a lot of time when doing a lot of lights.
2. Masking - I use 3M vinyl to do my masking, it seems to stick better than painter's tape. I cut circles to mask off switch recess and mask off any exposed threads.
3. Sandblasting - 100 grit aluminum oxide at 80 psi until the surface is evenly dull. This can take awhile and definitely helps to have a capable air compressor. The recessed areas like heat sink fins are the hardest to get at. The grippy surfaces on most of Hank's tubes have to be hit from every angle as well. The shop vac has to be running whenever you are blasting.
4. Cleaning - Spray off any remaining aluminum oxide with compressed air. Spray each part with degreaser and brush entire surface. Spray again with brake cleaner. Air compressor again.
5. Prep for Paint - I slip bent hooks inside of the head of the light. Bezels/rings are taped to cardboard.
6. Mix Paint - Catalyst has to be added to the paint to get it to harden. I use a variety of 1mL to 10mL glue syringes to measure out the paint and catalyst since it needs to be pretty precise. Changing the amount of catalyst alters the gloss of the finished product.
7. Spray - Usually around 25 to 35 PSI, apply a wet coat of paint. This is the part that took me the longest to perfect.  Spray pattern, angle, distance, and pressure will all affect the look of the finished product. Ideally, you only want one layer. The more layers that are added, the weaker the final product will be since the extra layers are no longer bonding to etched metal.
8. Cure - Air dry for 15 minutes then put in oven for 2 hours. This is where the hook comes in handy.
9. Unmask, reassemble, and enjoy!

Rather than try to end qualified immunity, we should try to end practical electability.  
Look at racism.  Go back to 1950 and saying 'we gotta keep black kids out of our schools' would get you elected.  Today, saying it once, even as a joke, would make you damn near unelectable for life.  

What changed?  The black community stood up and demanded recognition, but also destroyed stereotypes.  

MLK told his followers to march in their Sunday best clothing, to not engage in violence.  Because acting like animals would only justify racists to treat them like animals.  

We should do the same.  Stop the 'come and take it' stuff no matter how angry we are, start a new public awareness campaign to teach people about guns and gun safety culture and gun ownership and concealed carry.

The classics would be Attack on Titan and Death Note, incredible writing and serious from start to finish.

Now they have some comedy elements but the writing is so incredible that i couldn't forgive myself if i didn't mention them: Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and Hunter X Hunter. My personal favorite, legendary Anime. And should you go with HxH, don't let the beginning fool you, it's not for kids, not even close.

MHJ-Moore-Kmet may not be worth the 3500 you can get from Moore,Nabers,Kmet -- +3 1st round picks plus some 2nds.  


And it might turn out that Nabers is only slightly less regarded as a prospect to MHJ because Nabers is a damn animal and JF1 would benefit greatly from being able to throw to him. It's not MHJ or anything. But you should maximize your potential to hit and the difference between MHJ and Nabers might not be worth taking a shot at MHJ becoming All-pro in an offense that hasn't proven it can generate the touches & yards that would be required to have two ALL-Pro WRs",1704067270.0

Gun.Smoke is a really unusual shmup from Capcom in 1985, with a big emphasis on enemies who have random movement and move out of the way of your shots. They also try to get behind you, where they can shoot up at you but you can't shoot down at them. It almost feels more like a beat em up than a shmup, thanks to its focus on herding enemies with dynamic and unpredictable AI, and the bosses who summon a bunch of random regular enemies who help them out.

That is L's work. The other Japanese task force members also all (except for Matsuda) began suspecting Light as soon as the 13 day rule was debunked, which greatly limited Light's options.

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","No I totally agree with that. Dudes shouldn't be having that many wives if he can't love them all and treat them the same. Evidently homie is just screwing like a jack rabbit to get his genes out there. Kinda like my boy elon musk and nick cannon. They shouldn't be doing that, and they'll have to answer for it in the end. It's in our nature to abuse anything, and try to find a loop hole. 

The mahrame thing as uncomfortable as it is, a mahram is a protection for the woman. And I'm almost certain it's not obligatory, but some cultures again went overboard. Not necessarily Islam itself. 

The partying thing yes I know it belongs to them. I also know as someone who lives in the west, that it would've been better for me and many others not to get started on that path. I wish I would've had better influences in my life. People to show me a better alway to live, think about my future and so on. But everyone in my family partied and partied hard. And some of those things you do don't just affect you they affect your DNA making the next generation more susceptible to being attracted and addicted (talking about drugs and alcohol).

Well that didnt take long.The six year old thing I'm not 100 percent on on I've heard she was like a little older then that. And as uncomfortable as it sounds we can't compare those people to how we are now. For starters biologically it makes sense given that a woman's eggs are pretty much gone by her mid to late 30's. Pregnancies at that age are higher risk. Second I don't think any of his other wives were that young. If homie was a pedophile, we'd see alot more stories of him doodling kids. And we don't. 

Yes I am definitely saying being trans is Abad thing. Allowing a child to decide and put them on those drugs. Messing up their lives. I mean if your concerned about the 6 yr old straight girl because she don't know wtf is going on. Why does your moral compass flip here. We're literally sterilizing these kids and stopping them from enjoying the ability to orgasm. To feel bonded to someone else.

But I don't know if he actually gets traded. None of those (non-OKC) teams have a bowl you over type of asset package to offer. Pacers could prob put together the next best package, but they're the worst team and so probably shouldn't offer enough to make it happen.",1704067271.0

This is just not true.   Firstly many teams will be contacting the bears about trading the pick, it will be the bears taking those phone calls. In any situation, even if they were dead set on picking Williams, you shop the pick out to see what's its worth.

The team that lands 3rd in the draft and wants a QB will have to leapfrog 2 so it will be worth something to them. Because even if Bears just take a non QB at one,  Williams is gone at 2.  Therefore it will be worth something to the team 2nd too because they don't want team 3 to leapfrog them. So team 2 and 3 are now in a bidding war.",1704067272.0

If your dentists messes that up then you wake up feeling your teeth moved overnight. Of course your teeth didn't move but the unbalanced pressure points makes it feel that way.

Para desarrollar esta adicci√≥n hay que sumar un conjunto de factores de riesgo, de personalidad y del entorno pero si se consume pornograf√≠a a menudo el cerebro se acostumbrar√°. Necesitar√° cada vez m√°s im√°genes para poder excitarse. No se conformar√° con lo mismo. Pedir√° m√°s horas y m√°s cantidad, m√°s rapidez. Aparece la tolerancia.

- Unless you have stated that you wish to be contacted privately for privacy reasons, etc, please be wary of anyone who contacts you about your request outside of your post. We are unable to assist with any problems that may arise from dealing with users who contact you outside of this post.

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

"zenbuddhism","t5_2s19u","my friend your feelings are valid and you cannot think your way out of them, so please do not try. Instead, I recommend a variation of the technique used by the author of the song of enlightenment. 
Every time we breathe in, we are wired to notice vulnerably passively, viscerally, and randomly thanks to our sympathetic nervous system. 
every time we exhale, we are wired two physically, relax and mentally release even a little bit due to the working of our parasympathetic nervous system. 
Therefore, when you feel strong emotions during your inhalation, you could silently and mentally recite ‚Äúemotion‚Äú and during your exhalation you could suddenly and mentally recite, ‚Äú relax.‚Äú
This will not make the emotion go away, but it will harness the emotion and allow the energy of the emotion to serve your mindfulness and your meditation. 
Try it for five minutes every 12 hours or so and get back to me after seven consecutive days of practice with any questions you might have.

The main reason I have seen tends to be time/career.

So what you end up seeing is Muslim women who are doctors tend to just find other doctors to marry.

"CaregiverSupport","t5_2wrwy","As an autistic adult with chronic pain I have perhaps a unique perspective on your situation. (I‚Äôm obviously not a doctor.)

Is it at all possible that your husband is on the autism spectrum? His comments and behaviors suggest that an evaluation may be warranted. As others have suggested, a pain clinic that is multi-modal is also a good idea. They would address both his mental and physical health. After he has been through that you can assess whether or not the improvement makes enough difference to make the situation livable for your family.

Your son is 20. He is going to have ideas about how he wants to handle his future. He may not be able to express them to you right away since he‚Äôs overwhelmed at the moment. But he‚Äôll get there! Keep listening. And talk to his university about options for support if you haven‚Äôt. Some of them are amazing. I think your idea about re-enrolling him to keep is options open is fantastic. You do not live in a democracy (unfortunately it‚Äôs all on you!) and if you feel this is the right this to do, I urge you to take that step. 

The cluttered space would drive me insane as an autistic person, and I fear it may not be a calming environment for your son, either. Not to mention you! Is it possible to designate a project room? I would position this not as a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs contain your mess‚Äù but as a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make a perfect place to pursue your interests‚Äù kind of thing. Think a comfortable rolling chair that adjusts in all the ways (we finally found a Leap 2 on Craigslist which I use with footstool). Maybe run an inexpensive desktop along one wall.

"it","t5_247c","Tbh it actually is/can be that easy. The problem is you truly need to know your shit, which really only comes from real experience when you land that first net admin role. Even once you do have that bachelors, you still don‚Äôt really know shit aside from whatever labs you worked with. Theoretically, if you were knowledgeable enough to ace an interview, I know plenty of hiring managers who wouldn‚Äôt bother looking at credentials at all. Not to say they aren‚Äôt good to have, but people can tell how advanced your knowledge and skill sets are with just a few questions. It‚Äôs much harder to fake it in IT. 
This conversation is more relevant to other practices in the field, such as developer roles. It‚Äôs far easier for somebody to become a self taught dev, and be truly great at what they do without traditional schooling or real world experience‚Ä¶ mostly because anybody can pickup a book and get going in development with just a computer. Much lower barrier to entry when it comes to learning‚Ä¶ whereas with IT a huge part of your skills and expertise will come from the experience you gain working on the plethora of various systems you will encounter in the enterprise networks.

these days, with cloud based offerings you can become an expert with aws or azure without the costly equipment, the problem there is knowing what you should be studying, what knowledge is valuable. College will give you the fundamentals and help open your eyes to all the things you need to be learning about. It‚Äôs still up to you to do the work and gain the experience",1704067280.0

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","Well, take this with a grain of salt because I'm proud about how far I've come in my mental health journey and genuinely feel like in the next \~4 years (unless college goes royally shit), I will be an average member of society, but mental health struggles don't necessarily make compelling applicants. (mine in particular didn't make me an interesting APPLICANT. My mental health perhaps makes me a compelling person, but my academic interests lie well outside the struggles I am dealing with/dealt with ) Drive, compassion, thirst for knowledge, curiousity, etc, etc make applicants interesting. None of that has to do with my mental health struggles. Of course, I don't appear super happy, but really, you don't need to be. Those who are all the traits I outlined above aren't necessarily happy, but what applicants need to be (especially to really good universities) if they want a chance is un-apathetic. I've known plenty of mentally ill people who go onto great things (some while hurting themselves or others in the process but nevertheless) but hardly know any apathetic people who go onto such feats. Depression is a beast to deal with and I wish you well on your journey and I wouldn't necessarily lie on any of your applications, but there must be something that compels you and something you can show for that to be able to into a great university. That being said, no shame in just using your grades to get into your state school and focus on your healing rather than a top college. You don't need a top university to be successful and if healing hadn't been my priority for a long time, I have no doubt that I would not be here right now.",1704067280.0

Then it runs facial recognition on all my photos tag them to the folders automatically. Some if this server software is real resource intensive so a standard NUC or QNAP (basically a low cost Raspberryb Pi4 server build) just can't handle that, so you can dedicate some for your home server to process thus all hardcore.

>For a hot minute, Amy's entire character was just a girly girl who was romantically obsessed with Sonic.

Yeah that‚Äôll work. That‚Äôs enough to have going, on, basically the correct number of character traits. 

Action Adventure is not a real genre! We can be a little more specific here. Amy was made to join the ensemble cast of minor characters to a *90‚Äôs mascot platformer*  

The characters don‚Äôt need arcs, and they don‚Äôt need nuances. What they need are strong vibes. If describing their motivations + goals takes more than 5 words you have way overdone it, start over.


The formula here:  one appealing yet very simple aesthetic or emotion. It‚Äôs simple enough when it can be conveyed stylishly using only a half dozen judiciously placed second long pixel animations. Sonic is a ‚Äúcool hero*. Knuckles is a *dumb hothead*. Amy is *girlu and cute*. You get the idea!  Relationships to other characters are built with the same basic ethos you need things to be punchy and memorable, and crucially conveyed to the player requiring very little in the way of time time or perceptiveness.

1. Everyone goes celebrates/rests whatever after the events of the last session and hits the hey. When they wake up, they're dazed, confused, obviously recovering from some magic or drug induced sleep. Everyone is chained up by their wrists in a basement. Have them make a fairly easy check to free themselves. Their gear will be in a set of crates outside the room. They'll then discover, after leaving the house the basement is in, a dank field with an alter in the middle, surrounded by a band of cultists. As soon as they discover this, the high priest of the cult brings down his blade and holds his hand high, clutching the still beating heart of your fiend warlock. Added flavor points if the cult worships her patron.

Everyone rolls initiative.

2. You're chilling wherever you're at, a dark figure arises from the road, and declares, ""the time to fulfill your end of our bargain has come. You are mine."" Que hellish hands appearing around your warlock and drag me to hell style pulling her into the abyss.

3. If you wanna be cheeky, as the party wanders about, a giant eagle swoops in, grabs the warlock, impaling her in the process, and flies away. Leaving everyone gobsmacked and unable to react.",1704067284.0

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules

>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

I think you just have a personal issue with it, and that's fine, you don't have to drink. No one does. But don't cast it aside as a waste just because of your personal bias. This isn't a conversation about how you feel. It's about how alcohol impacts your health.

Largely a drink or less a day isn't a significant risk. You're best to stay under that. And like many things, alcohol brings risk.",1704067285.0

Just in cas anyone could benefit from this, I will add a little more info from our lawyer: if you are Venezuelan and entered the US before July of this year (I forget the exact cutoff date), you can also apply for the ""protected status"" and a work permit alongside the asylum application, it is a good failsafe in case the asylum application doesn't get approved (as only like 30% of asylum applications get approved even if the applicant has a good claim). You don't even have to have documents from the border, as long as you can provide some sort of proof you were here since July (like rental contracts, medical documents, etc).

I don't know if I misunderstood but I would like to mention that the number of Germans who migrated to the US from Eastern Europe (Germans from Poland, Volhynia, the Black Sea, the Volga, etc.) is immense. Think that today there are almost no Germans there and 100 years ago there were millions of Germans.

I would dare say that in the US 1/5 Germans came from Eastern Europe, they were the ones who had the greatest urge to move. 

I'm from South America with German ancestry and I would say the majority of Germans who came here to Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil (outside of the first waves that came a lot from Southern Germany, Switzerland, etc.) came from Eastern Europe.",1704067286.0

"Games","t5_2qhwp","**Yakuza: Kiwami**

Haven't finished it (Chapter 7), it's fun but as expected feels a little bare bones after 0. The first boss balance seems way off, he's a sponge, and if you don't spec into the heat moves with your first points (like me) even more so. So if you're going into it, take that as a warning.

The core game is quite good still, it feels easier to clean up side stories, and I do love running into Majima Everywhere. I didn't really like the abrupt change he had at the end of 0 but not because I don't like the change, it just felt sudden. Combat so far, at least on normal, mostly consists of me being in Brawler and doing XXYY and heat moves. Some bosses are harder but that gets the job done usually and stun locks quite a few enemies.

Anyway I don't really find it that exciting to play for some reason, but it is relaxing, so I just play a little bit now and then. I'm eager to see how the city evolves with the series.

**Melvor Idle**

It was free on Epic and as usual idle games confuse but addict me. I understand why people like them, they're just a distilled management game. It's like Civilization without the units, or probably Football Manager, or any other strategic games, with zero tactical elements. They remind me a lot of the old browser games from the 90s-00s. Even still, it's a good example of how something can be enticing and addicting with emotional wants overriding the conscious thoughts that I should probably play a game with a decent story or something.

Township balance feels a bit off. Dunno why I'm always out of planks and some items but drowning in others. Since buildings cap out, it's not like my investment was in the wrong place, it's nearly all done.

I was following the guide to fish early for the skill rings, and I got the skill one early but the mastery one is taking a while, so I'm wondering if I should move on. But it's an idle game, I can just go play Yakuza more anyway.",1704067286.0

That area is annoying as fuck I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs similar to Blightown just with less confusing level design. Or like trying to do the platforming to get to the abandoned workshop, I died like 20 times trying to land in just the right spot.

DS1 is very much like all the other souls games it‚Äôs just an older version and plays slower, I think even souls game has those challenges that often we find annoying or tedious.",1704067287.0

You don't want a piece of the company. You don't want your financial security tied up in the effort and labor from .a man you are no longer married to. 

The business might also be worth much less than you think without your husband working in it. 

You want a fairly built agreement, which compensates you fairly for your lost earning power. 

You should also consider the time he already invested in the business. You are also asking for half of that. This could be where your friends reaction is coming from.

I am hugely against one spouse stopping working, even more so when the other spouse is a business owner. You become 100% beholden to the success of failure of the business. The SAH spouse loses the ability to earn a lifestyle supporting income, and often the business owner isn't able to slot in to someone else's business in a highly compensated way. So if the business blows up, you are double-fucked.

I have been down that road; my wife quit working full time right after my company started, and it was terrifying being the sole means of support, when so many things outside your control and kill you. We had a couple spots where I had to not draw a salary when things were tight, and when my wife went looking, her job hunting went dismally.


TLDR don't go SAHM unless you already have the financial assets to support retirement.",1704067287.0

As the other posters have said, your music isn't IDM. Nor does it really fit squarely into any other genre.

Not fitting squarely into any categorization is definitely not a negative, per se. However what I'm hearing in your tracks is sort of a distillation of very generic beats and synth patterns. It sounds like you're mimicking the surface aspects of EDM genres without grokking the characterization(s) that define genre.

That said, maybe it would be best to disregard genre and just focus on making music that evokes anything. Draw from what evokes feelings for you. What movies or books or music do you dig? Do they give a harried, frantic vibe? Is it a dark dystopian vibe? Carefree euphoric vibe? Esoteric trickery vibe? Adrenaline coursing high stakes vibe? None of these relate to genre but they are more essential to good music. Genre definition is often more about the technicalities of presentation, anyway.

Making evocative music is a concern before accessing fans of a genre is a concern. If it evokes nothing then nobody will ever care regardless of how squarely it integrates with a genre.",1704067288.0

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

>‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ôº∏ What does this mean?

>‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

>‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei",">His body naturally metabolizes ambient energy, like solar radiation, that his body changes into his iconic red, unheated concussive blasts.

This is somehow just as bad. Why can't his eyes just shoot lasers.

Anyway as for misconceptions my hill to die on is that the popular perception that the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist anime started off by adapting the manga, ran out of material, then just went off the rails and made up a bunch of shit/filler episodes until the end for some reason is total bullshit. It's something that *seems* like it could be true so a bunch of anime youtubers started saying it without checking any sources at all and now everything sucks forever.

What actually happened is that the studio knew that if they tried to adapt the manga that exact thing would happen so they decided instead to take bits and pieces of the manga, completely rework them, and use them to tell a broader story completely independent of the manga that was original right from the beginning.

The manga and the anime share only passing similarities if you look at *really* broad strokes. There is no ""divergence point"" and the two stories have virtually nothing to do with one another.",1704067289.0

What people say doesn't affect me the least bit. I know myself, know what i want from life, I know the most the life I have lived and the circumstances that lead me to make the decisions that made me who I am today. The worst red flag for me is the people who live the life society wants them to live and the way society wants them to live. I can't stand generic people.


>. I don't want drama or distraction from this career opportunity. I have so many things to do and there's a lot of money on the line. 

Are you expecting drama?

>So I posited to him that maybe we don't need to start a relationship right now, better to wait until I finish this work transition.

I don't think it's fair to ""delay"" or make people wait for you for this reason...

 >He asked what that objectively meant to me, I said earning back my financial investment. Estimated 1 or 2 fiscal quarters. He agreed that that wasn't unreasonable or unfair if me to ask for.

He sounds smart and reasonable 


>Even though I knew he was going to call, moment of insecurity: I asked him to call me at midnight on NYE, and it instead of saying yes of course, he joked that we are coworkers January 1 and I said we wouldn't be considering getting together before June 2024.

Tell me what do you expect him to do meanwhile until june? how are you going to feel if he started dating someone else or had sex with someone else. Officially, you're not together but it's not like there is nothing..there's something ""on hold""

> I admit, I kind of spiraled after that. It was a really bitter reminder that, yet again, I am single and alone on NYE. Conversation was started in that heat of emotion and ended on him saying:

I feel that you're focused on the wrong thing and frankly that's your own doing. Btw you may start dating in june and it may end before NYE 2025, so you just missed being with someone you love on NYE and who knows if you're going to be with him next year...


>He's not wrong. But I'm bitter and hurt. Today is NYE. I don't want let it just pass again. He's a little patronizing, but he's not wrong. I resent that he thinks he needs to make better decisions on my behalf. But it's a text message, so tone is deaf. The best thing for me is to focus on this new job. If this really is something important, then he will still like as much this time next year and he likes me today. 

You have no right to be bitter...you can be hurt but you did it to yourself.
And he is making the decisions you wanted to make for yourself. This relationship is already damaged, and he's going to feel bitter next..",1704067290.0

‚ÄúEven though conclusive clinical evidence that persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with declined cardiac function has not been reported so far, the proof-of-concept study of the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 persistent infection of the heart and the potential risk of opportunistic progression of heart failure should be validated by a three-dimensional human cardiac tissue model which would serve as the alarm bell for a global healthcare risk,‚Äù the report claims.

"newbrunswickcanada","t5_2r62y","""You do realize"" that 16 yrs ago is 16 yrs ago now right? Or that Manitoba was run by PC the last 8 yrs & was the worst province in the pandemic because we were the ONLY province who didn't get any help by our govt? 

Our Premier spent the extra money sent from Federal to help us when shut down to bid on a CFL season that wasn't happening (2 million of it), gave money to businesses ONLY, spent money on ""re-open signage"" letting seniors die in homes rampant with COVID & told people to barter with their landlord over rent? 

Oh & then the fucker literally ran away before the pandemic was over & was replaced by another in his party just like him who also did more incredulous things. 

Alberta's PC Premier ran away too. Saskatchewan has gone all ridiculously religious.

"DecidingToBeBetter","t5_2tand","Hey friend! I understand your anxiety about moving to the big city, but honestly.. like seriously‚Ä¶ You absolutely should. You might find your life is stunted still when you go back home.
You‚Äôre not wasting money by paying rent. Housing isn‚Äôt free (unfortunately) and you‚Äôll have to move out anyways. 

Moving to a new and bigger city offers so much in terms of possibilities for new relationships and friendships. You can join a new gym, recreational sports, other types of clubs for whatever you‚Äôre interested in! But you won‚Äôt meet anyone or make new connections if you avoid that world. 

Have you done anything to address your anxiety? It will be a lot easier to embrace new opportunities and connections when you have your anxiety under control. Medication and therapy could change your life (it did mine) 

Also, you‚Äôre absolutely still young. Those people getting married in their 20s are likely to divorce so don‚Äôt look at them and get FOMO. I‚Äôm 30 and single and idgaf - live your life for YOU

"ANormalDayInRussia","t5_2z166",">that doesnt invalidate your opinion it's just irrrelevant when speaking of morale

That's precisely the point, though.

The ""whataboutism"" doesn't make either point invalid, and makes both desire an explanation.

The issue is, logically speaking, if you say ""It's okay for A, but not for B"", then you are either:

* (1) Engaging in hypocrisy (if you hold the opinion that all people ought to be treated by an equal standard)

* (2) Engaging in some form of discrimination (if you don't believe in equal standards for A and B), or 

* (3) Required to justify specifically why A and B ought to be treated differently (i.e. Pertaining to differences in qualia).

Yes, it is a ""what about"", but it is used appropriately. It doesn't dismiss either case, but seeks a statement of position regarding what seems to be a differential standard.",1704067291.0

I do think that it would be much more healthy for them if they set aside time for friends. It not uncommon for parents to literally forget who they are outside of being a parent. They have to remember that they deserve to devote some time to themselves, and not be selfless for their child. Maybe you can remind them of that and ask them if it‚Äôs something they need.

"kpophelp","t5_2vyk1","SM:  Changmin (TVXQ), Ryeowook, Yesung, and Kyuhyun (Super Junior), Onew (SHINee), Baekhyun, D.O., and Chen (EXO). Kyuhyun is no longer part of SM, but spent like 20 years there so we can still count him. Also honorable mention to Jonghyun who is no longer with us. I also don't follow NCT and RIIZE enough to suggest anyone from there, but there's no way they don't have at least one great vocalist.   
JYP: Jun.K (2pm) is highly underrated and objectively good. I don't know the other boy groups as much from JYP to suggest anyone else.  
YG: Seungyoon (Winner) also underrated in kpop talks, but he won 6 consecutive times on KoMS setting a record.  
HYBE: Baekho (Solo, formerly NU'EST), DK and Seungkwan (SVT), again, I don't know the other boy groups as much to suggest them. 

These are the best in terms of technique that I know, but I don't really follow boy groups past 3rd generation so my list isn't exhaustive. Having an amazing vocalist just isn't as much of a priority as it used to be, that's really all there is to it. Overall, as others have mentioned, SM has almost a monopoly on objectively good vocalists. Pledis (now under HYBE) was created from former SM staff, which can definitely be seen in that I'd say everyone in NU'EST and Seventeen are on average better than most boy groups.",1704067291.0

"boxoffice","t5_2r1ky","I highly doubt it. Superman hasn't had a well received movie since the 70's, and his highest grossing movie was BvS, which was decidedly not well received. If Legacy is good, the sequel could hit big numbers, but even with the hype behind Man of Steel, it couldn't hit $700M. This one is coming after a bunch of poorly received DC films, and Superman's last appearance (outside of cameos) being Justice League. If it tops Man of Steel, call it a win.

As for The Batman, the reception to the last one was decidedly mixed. I'm a huge comic nerd who grew up on the Animated Series and probably won't even bother seeing it in theaters. They took a more niche-appeal approach to the character, and the detective story had a ton of holes. I doubt the sequel even tops the first. Hopefully, when the DCU re-introduces Batman, they take more of a Nolan-like direction with it.

The DC brand is in the trash right now. We just finished a year with four DC bombs, and even the sequel to DC's most successful movie looks like it won't gross a third of its predecessor. There is no extreme anticipation level for DC's reboot. The brand will have to regain fan trust before it sees another real serious box office hit.",1704067292.0

The former, yes, they can tell you.  The latter has issues with union/legal stuff (if they're eventually planning on firing tenured faculty, which can and does happen), but also creates PR issues - students don't want to go to a failing school, so the enrollment drops more, which means more cuts, which means more bad press, which means more declines, and boom, death-spiral.",1704067292.0

**Direct Message ""Build Help"" Offer Scams**

A number of accounts are running spam-bots targeting this subreddit to send out PMs and DMs to all users who submit posts here. These accounts sometimes pose as teenagers offering to help design a build in exchange for a ""donation"" to help them build a rig of their own, various companies offering services through external websites, or even users just claiming to offer help via PM. **Do not reply to these messages.** These users are well known to engage in aggressive and harassing messaging behaviours to persuade users to accept help and to coerce them into sending money, regardless of whether the user actually wanted help or not. This subreddit thrives and grows on the volunteer efforts of every contributor who helps around here, often leaning and improving from seeing the work of others.

Horror itself is just a genre of media and isnt for everyone. I loved it ever since I was a kid cause it either had fun characters, great stories that focus on other themes not typical on other media, or that sense of dread and fear you dont get other places.     
     
Plus horror also has many sub-genre that help satisfy the viewers.    
     
Like slashers typically focus kills and gore with a more character focused story and a centered antagonist that a story is buildt around like how jason while being the main villain of friday the 13th is technically the main character as most of the interest is focused on jason besides a few movies that focus more on the survivors like tommy jarvis.    
     
Supernatural horror typically focuses on otherworldly horror not really native to people and gives more options for wild events and stories on grander scales.      
     
Existential horror is more for people to think about it later and ponder on that horror and generally sticks with them later and helps apply people into looking at other perspectives.     
     
Horror is definitely not for everyone.

I dont focus on reddit much maybe once every two weeks I hit up 20-30 groups. Being married and living in small town im going to pass on the dating apps. My social content feels quite PG too. I work on 2 phones. I believe the last month 10 out of 12 of my IGs and TTs are severly shadowbanned getting 30-90 views a video. I also as of 3 weeks ago have my first viral IG account...im holding my breath that it stays that way. I used to try hard chatting but almost no one responds. every month I have about 1-3 subs that chat with me. im not sure if I should keep sending simple dms to people saying hi, come chat and say hi when they dont. I have noticed my chatters buy more ppv but its 50/50 they waste my time and dont also. Thanks for your time im struggling!",1704067295.0

"Wastewater","t5_2qt21","Sludge production or sludge yield correlates to age and temperature. Young sludge in log growth could be 0.8 lbs (or more) per 1 lb CBOD. Old sludge that's endogenous could be 0.6 lbs (or less) per 1 lb CBOD.

Making some assumptions here: influent CBOD of 200 ppm, MLSS of 3,000 ppm and RAS of 7,500 ppm... Your yield would be upwards of 0.9 - this doesn't sound right for an oxi-ditch but you could calc with real figures.

Less waste = less production. Less solids out = more solids backup.

One trick you can do is turn the RAS off for a bit before wasting to let it concentrate some more (less WAS gallons for the same lbs). This can give results that jump around, but consistency will help.

Another approach is using a mass balance to have thicker blankets (less WAS gallons for the same lbs). This is not perfect, but:

(Qclar/Qras)=(RAStss/AERtss). 

In your case a RAS ratio of 0.75 -> (1+0.75)/0.75=2.33. Your expected RAStss would be about 2.33x of your MLSS. Slowing RAS will build thicker blankets, but be cautious that you could have thickening failure eventually.

If your digester is just sludge holding, cycle the air to burn up some volatiles which will make space.

Lastly, I know this isn't a real solution, but plants should not be operating their wet stream according to the dry stream systems. If you can't waste how you need to, the real answer is to get a dry stream that can accommodate. Easier said than done.",1704067295.0

The non leachable heavy metal that is there in all the solar panels of the world is nothing compared to the toxic leachable heavy metal present in coal ash in a single large sized ash pond!!! Speak to a fucking metallurgist and do the maths.

Wind turbine blades are buried - so is fucking household trash bound for landfills. A million times more so. And so is fucking coal ash. Millions of tonnes of it. At the power station and at the coal wash wet tailings dam.

Ehn, y'know, maybe, maybe not.

Every person who's addicted to something, whether it's drugs, fame, attention, money, sex, gambling, whatever... whatever drives them in a way they don't want it to... at its core, is because there is a hole in them that needs to be filled.

Deep down, people are unsatisfied, and that's how they open themselves to be vulnerable to all the toxic addictions in life.

People who don't have that, are immune to addiction. They have conquered themselves.

Waking up and spending your day doing something you don't want to do, takes its toll. But that's life. You have to either change it somehow, or accept it as necessary but not let it conquer you. Every person's journey is different.

If you're not happy, change something. If you want something you don't have, you have to do something you haven't done.",1704067296.0

Think these are pretty baseless counter arguments ...  they ""don't follow"" based upon the OP's statements - you describe an expectation that the OP did NOT have, an example of an ""unreasonable expectation"", then argue against it...  so that's strawman as well as the non-sequitor, mon.  Keep tryin...  


Those kind of sound like ""fanboyz"" arguments - those people who worship at the altar of Larian and who therefore take offense at any less-than glowing opinions of their works.

Easy to spot.  Like all those folks that argue that the MC is better with no voiced lines, and that voiced MC lines would \_reduce\_ immersion, while the non-fanboys say that a one-sided conversation where our character stands there with a goofy look and SAYS NOTHING is immersion-breaking.   Never mind that a simple toggle could remove said voiced lines...  never mind that a game that is making $BILLIONS is somehow unable to put in the effort in production to make for voiced MC lines.

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","Wasn't that long ago that 10 was blazing fast. It was like last week that 100 was blazing fast lol. The fact we're now talking in gigs per second blows my mind because basically the new standard increased by a factor of ten (aka a whole order of magnitude) in like two or three years.

But yea, I can speak from experience that 10 will get the job done at the current moment if you're okay watching everything in SD and waiting a few seconds for pages to load.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I guess it depends what you want, but a telephoto lens like that does the compression by its‚Äô very nature. Compression is just the ‚Äúbringing together‚Äù of objects far away and objects closer to the camera. Obviously with the widest angle being 70mm, you‚Äôll still need to be further away from the subject than with most lenses. One example of using the compression in the lens would be if you found an overlook with mountains stretching into the distance. At 200mm you can bunch up the mountain layers and make them looked ‚Äústacked up‚Äù in frame, with the farthest away peaks still feeling prominent. Or another example, if you wanted to capture a figure on a hilltop with the mountain behind them being prominent and or large in the frame, a telephoto lens like yours would be great to make the figure larger and make the mountain appear like it‚Äôs looming large behind them. Any wider of a lens and the mountain would seem too small and far away. But the compression of the lens should be automatic, finding the compositions that lend themselves better to that compression is the trick.",1704067296.0

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I'm going to describe things more in the way Galois viewed the story, not in the modern (due to Emil Artin) way involving field automorphisms.

It appears your interest is in how we can show certain polynomials don't have a certain type of formula for their roots (built up in terms of square roots, cube roots, etc.starting from the polynomial's coefficients and field operations). So that's what I'll focus on, but *please* keep in mind that this is not what ""Galois theory"" means.  It's just the original motivating problem that led to Galois theory, and it's a problem nobody cares about in current research in modern math even. Galois theory itself is still important in areas like number theory, for very different reasons than whatever the original motivation of Galois was.


What we want to do is look at all the roots a polynomial f(x) has and ask what kind of restrictions there could possibly be when any of the roots can be written in terms of root extractions and field operations.   
It is not at all clear that there is a meaningful restriction when that ""root formula"" property occurs, but it turns out there is one. 

I'm going to work inside the complex numbers, so forget about wacky fields of positive characteristic and their potentially unusual properties.


The key that Galois looked at was ""algebraic relations among the roots"" and how permutations (relabeling) of the roots may or may not preserve all those relations. By ""algebraic relation among the roots"" I mean a polynomial equation involving the roots and the coefficients based on the coefficients of f(x) and rational numbers: we're not trying to build algebraic relations involving pi or other such things. A simple relation could be ""the roots add up to 2"" or ""the roots have product 5"". The identity permutation on the roots would preserve all such relations.  It turns out, depending on f(x), that sometimes there are permutations of the roots where *not* all algebraic relations among the roots get preserved.

**Example**.   Look at the four roots of x^4 - 2:  two real roots and two non-real roots.  Those 4 roots have 24 permutations (4! = 24).  But some of those permutations wreck algebraic relations among the roots.  The two real roots add up to 0 (that's a relation: r + s = 0), but a real root and non-real root don't add up to 0.  So a permutation of the roots that even has a chance of preserving all possible algebraic relations among the roots must send the two real roots to either the two real roots or the two non-real roots.  Complex conjugation on the 4 roots is an example of a permutation of the roots that preserves all the algebraic relations among them.  It turns out that 8 of the 24 permutations of the roots preserve all the algebraic relations among the roots.  When two permutations preserve all the algebraic relations among the roots, so do their inverses and their composition, so the set of such permutations is a *subgroups* of the symmetric group on the 4 roots. 

**Example**.  Look at the three roots of x^3 - 2.  There are 6 permutations, and it turns out *all* of them preserve every algebraic relation among the 3 roots.  


When f(x) has degree n, the permutations of its roots that preserve all algebraic relations among the n roots form a subgroup of the symmetric group on n letters.  That is the Galois group of f(x).  This is a finite group with size dividing n!. In the special case that f(x) = x^n - a, its Galois group has the following property:

> it has an increasing tower of subgroups (starting at the trivial subgroup and ending at the whole Galois group) that are each normal in the next higher subgroup and the quotient of each larger subgroup by the preceding smaller subgroup is abelian.  

Yes, this is a pretty technical thing, purely coming out of algebra, and it's a property of the Galois group whenever f(x) = x^n - a. Whenever f(x) is a polynomial whose roots are described using repeated root extractions and field operations on the coefficients of f(x), its Galois group has the same technical property as what I wrote above.

If all finite groups had the above property, we wouldn't get anywhere.  But it turns out many finite groups do *not* have the above property, such as the symmetric and alternating groups on n letters when n is at least 5.  So a polynomial with such a group as its Galois group can *not* have its roots described using repeated root extractions and field operations on the coefficients of the polynomial.  

There are concrete polynomials of degree n with the symmetric group on n letters as its Galois group, such as x^5 - x - 1 when n = 5. (How one actually *calculates* a Galois group is beyond the scope of this reply!) We can say about these polynomials that there is no way to write their roots using repeated root extractions and field operations on the coefficients of the polynomial.",1704067297.0

People can't base their vote on the existence a deepfake video of Trump or Biden saying the N-word came out the way they could base their vote on an embarrassing photograph of, say, Dukakis in a tank. People can't just turn off their brains and follow the herd or vote based off of vibes.

I'm pretty cynical, but even I'm betting people will start paying attention to this crap real soon once people start getting scammed of a few million of deepfake-enabled campaign donations of the 'OMG did you hear what so-and-so said?! Donate to us to fight this evil!'",1704067297.0

If things are imbalanced you fix them by changing the game, not by how the game interprets input.

This seems like a really lazy band aid to the defensive disadvantage. You shouldn't have to tell the device in charge of determining the results of an action what the rules are, the game should do that automatically.

And the defense should never be at a disadvantage anyway. That a rule in everything from chess to war, attacking is always harder. They made a bad game.",1704067297.0

Since then a worsening cost-of-living crisis has outpaced wages and we've had two straight generations where they've been expected to be worse off than their parents. It's nowhere near the 1930s but it is starting to resemble the early 1900s. It's not dominant but it's regained it's footing.

>Ah, no. That's employee ownership. Socialism is government ownership of the means of production.

So if it's no disrespect, allow me to tell you more about that, as a Socialist myself. There are forms of socialism that advocate that idea of a centrally planned, government-owned economy. It's a policy called State Socialism. 

However this isn't the only type of socialism. There's also Market Socialism which argues for a market economy of employee-owned businesses, and Libertarian Socialism which emphasizes being against the government interfering with the economy or peoples lives. And a whole bunch of other ideas in-between.

Most leftists you'll meet today are not going to be State Socialists. Libertarian Socialists, which firmly rejects State Socialism as a policy, are the biggest currently.",1704067297.0

"futebol","t5_2tfgu","Preso ao Ouroboros, lembro do sentimento que tomou minha inf√¢ncia e minha adolesc√™ncia. Uma leve melancolia: nunca incapacitante, mas sempre intrusa na minha felicidade. Desisti v√°rias vezes, logo cedo desisti da escolinha de futebol. Esperneava e gritava, n√£o queria voltar, ao menos √© isso que me disseram. Fiz o mesmo com o jud√¥, com a nata√ß√£o, com o handebol e com o projeto do corpo de bombeiro com a prefeitura. Lembro de fazer os polichinelos no projeto 'botinho' e ter vergonha de mim. Entrei em p√¢nico na aula ‚Äîo que pode ter sido um prel√∫dio da minha ansiedade‚Äî e mudei de escola no 7¬∫ ano. Pela primeira vez em uma escola particular, tive um aprendizado excelente, aprendi tudo e buscava mais. Pedi a alguns professores conhecimentos a mais e alguns ficavam depois da aula conversando comigo.

Mas das rela√ß√µes fica uma lembran√ßa de solid√£o. Meu √∫nico amigo at√© o ensino m√©dio me disse recentemente que eu apanhava recorrentemente, mas eu sinceramente n√£o me lembro. Ele foi falando dos casos que lembrava e tamb√©m voltou √† minha mem√≥ria. O que me marcou mais, foi que, por um tempo, um cara entrava na sala e sempre batia minha cabe√ßa na mesa de surpresa. Talvez nessa √©poca aprendi a obedecer, abaixar a cabe√ßa. Eu n√£o tinha parte em nada naquele mundo. Estudava muito, claro que isso me rendeu excelentes frutos no futuro, mas sei que fazia isso *tamb√©m* para me isolar.

Apanhei na rua, apanhei na sala. Em casa, n√£o apanhei, mas cresci vendo meu pai e seus abusos com minha m√£e. Pouca agress√£o, mas muita viol√™ncia psicol√≥gica. Ele era um s√≠mbolo sempre presente de medo. Seus par√¢metros eram absolutos, a ponto de desejar minha morte no momento que eu disse que n√£o acreditava em Deus. Hip√≥crita.

Tinha pavor de falar com mulheres, isso vem desde cedo na minha vida. Recentemente, h√° uns anos, perdi completamente isso, mas mesmo assim sofri demais com essa merda. A ponto de 2 ou 3 garotas falarem que estavam a fim de mim no Ensino Fundamental e eu, em p√¢nico, falar qualquer coisa agressiva pra n√£o ter que lidar com aquilo.

Hoje, eu t√¥ melhor, tenho certeza disso. √â como se minha mente estivesse limpa. Ter transado com minha vizinha fez um bem absurdo para mim, tenho certeza. Depois disso, √© como se eu percebesse que n√£o sou e nunca fui um idiota. Tenho vergonha do que disse pra a nordestina, se eu entendesse tudo isso √† √©poca, teria ido muito al√©m de alguns beijos, teria namorado ela e n√£o teria que v√™-la por dois anos com aquele namorado pau no cu dela, que muleque filho da puta, papo reto.

Sei l√°, tenho perspectivas melhores no futuro. √â engra√ßado como um ano novo t√£o parado vai ser um dos mais otimistas da minha vida. N√£o tenho mais o fantasma da melancolia na minha mente.

Hoje, tenh",1704067298.0

I‚Äôve taken PESI trainings, including a 3 day CBT one. They‚Äôre good, especially as a starting point. If it‚Äôs affordable and accessible, sounds like a good place to start.

There is no one course for all of that, but if you know someone in your company that has some of these skills ask if they can mentor you or take you to some meetings or show u some of the work. Be frank about your aspirations and tell them you value their skills in X area and would like to learn more. :) good luck.

* Day 11 - Google will probably try and take you along Wielangta Rd. Don't do this (the road is unsealed and can become unpassable after heavy rains), and go via Sorell instead.
* Day 12 - Go to Hobart via Richmond Village and spend a couple of hours exploring there by foot

"RWBYcritics","t5_wuw08","It‚Äôs always funny comparing activists writing LGBTQ+ characters compared to straight writers doing it.

I still remember when Total Drama Island‚Äôs reboot was leaked with random tidbits, and the first highlighted point was that this series would feature a gay couple as the primary couple this time.

Most long time viewers were concerned about this idea, especially since the prospect of a stereotypical ‚Äúgay teen.‚Äù Was not something a lot of people were too keen on.

I myself was more concerned because TD relationships have a very bad track record with the teen stereotypes chosen for said relationships.

It wasn‚Äôt really revealed who the gay couple would be, but when character renders were first shown off let‚Äôs just say people got less enthusiastic by the idea.

No one in the renders really screamed ‚Äúgay.‚Äù Which was a good sign, except for the fact that it looked like we got another pair characters who are designed to work only with each other.

Needless to say, the producers actually stayed quiet on promoting anything about the cast. So we really only knew we‚Äôd get a gay couple through leaks.

I tend to not judge favorites until after the first episode airs. Just because it usually gives insite into who the good characters will be. But I knew from the moment it was leaked that one of the gay characters would be a finalist and possible winner.

The show opened with introducing the first of the two gay characters, but kept the second one a secret for a long time.

I actually came to adore the two gay characters. The one who ended up as a finalist was the openly gay one, and he was definitely a highlight, because the show actually made him a secondary antagonist. Which ended up working well because he became the second most popular character from the reboot.

He lost to the actual antagonist, who was an influencer of all things, but it goes to show how well it can be when you put character first and message second",1704067301.0

"scientology","t5_2qh3a","NED didn't exist until 1978. It's 1968 Standard R3R Dianetics with bells and whistles, which is a based on the Time Track and Engram Running by Chains bulletins, beginning with 15 May AD 13 [sic, 1963].

The original people who were authoritatively told by Hubbard that there were, suddenly discovered, lots and lots of Clears being made by Dianetics, had R3R Standard Dianetics *before* the Lower Grades.  

R3R Dianetics was then at the bottom of the Grade Chart.

The old Hubbard Standard Dianetics Course course pack was hastily edited and revised by sleep deprived tech aides with ""somatics"" changed to ""considerations."" Do today's Scientologist even know about this?

Also in 1978, Hubbard announced that keyed out Clear IS Clear. The starry eyed Scientologists couldn't see it, but Hubbard was saying there was no such thing as Clear, but we were  going to call that keyed out state, Clear.

And everyone cheered!

Years later, after leaving Scientology, Hubbard's personal auditor and the senior tech person in Scientology, David Mayo, wrote: **""It was PR and marketing considerations that led Hubbard to decide that certain people were Clear at a certain point.""**

This was in the wake of the 1977 FBI raids after Hubbard's covert spying and dirty tricks network was exposed. Hubbard wanted money even more than before. The rich Missions began being attacked for ""holding onto Clears,"" etc.",1704067302.0

"1102","t5_2ycvf1","Thank you for sharing your candid perspective as a former USAID 1102 and shedding light on the nuances and challenges of working within the agency. Your insights provide valuable food for thought for those considering a career at USAID or a similar organization.  


It's clear from your experience that USAID has a distinct culture and mission orientation, often attracting individuals with a deep commitment to ""saving the world."" As you've noted, this commitment can sometimes lead to involvement with contractors that may present challenges. The emphasis on procurement management and the potential reluctance to disrupt the status quo within the agency can be eye-opening for those entering the field.  


Your observations about the insular politics of USAID and the international development world highlight the complexities of working within such a tightly-knit community. The intertwining of interests, such as contractors transitioning to new roles immediately after retiring, underscores the need for vigilance in maintaining procurement integrity.  


The hierarchical structure of USAID, with its mission directors and the importance of navigating these dynamics even while working at headquarters, offers valuable insights into the intricacies of the organization.

  
Your personal career transition story is both enlightening and encouraging. It demonstrates that individuals willing to speak up, advocate for their principles, and challenge the status quo can find opportunities that align more closely with their values.  


In conclusion, your message serves as a thought-provoking reminder that, while a career at USAID can offer unique and impactful experiences, it's crucial for individuals to carefully consider how they can navigate the challenges and maintain their values within the agency. Ultimately, deciding to work at USAID or a similar organization requires a thoughtful assessment of one's priorities and principles.",1704067305.0

"dui","t5_2tqam","I‚Äôm not vouching for or saying this happens in every situation. But like you I was charged with a second dui. My first happened 5 or so years ago and the second on 9/30 2022. I said not guilty even tho there was a huge crash. I refused the breathalyzer so they took me to jail by the time I breathed for them there I was under the legal limit. The DAs office in New Hampshire forgot to provide my lawyer with the copy of the first dui I got in maine. Which needs to be a legal document which can only be acquired by the da calling the Maine court where my first dui happened. Basically my lawyer told me the same thing roll the dice or take the minimum. When we got there my lawyer talked to the da he informed him he was missing information (at this point way to late to acquire and I would need of have been provided a copy anyway) and he told my lawyer he would agree to drop it down to a dui first offense. Which is class B misdemeanor but no jail time. I was originally facing the minimum at least which is 5 days jail time and 3 years license lost. In the end I walked out with no jail time and 1.5 year license lost. I guess my advice would be to have your lawyer have a friendly conversation with the DA see what he‚Äôs trying to get you with punishment wise and see if he says anything about the discovery without being asked about it. Then you‚Äôll kind of have an idea if he knows he‚Äôs missing anything or not. At least if he brings it up to your lawyer you know to take the minimum and not fight it.",1704067305.0

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","I am a new Buddhist, and I hated reincarnation. Still do, honestly. I don't find it comforting.

But so did the Buddha! That's why Buddhism exists. He wanted to find a way off the hamster wheel of samsara. He didn't find it comforting. He found it perpetuated the cycle of suffering. 

It's not about living a ""good enough"" life to escape the cycle. It's about realizing, truly realizing the nature of reality. Yes, moral development is a big part of that, but recognizing who we are, what reality is, and releasing that clinging...that's where we learn how to stop spinning the wheel. We realize that it's only our leg power that is turning the wheel and if we want to get off of it, we need to stop. I'm very new, so this is undoubtedly not the best explanation. 

When I grudgingly- and it was very grudgingly- came to accept reincarnation as true, it was because I truly believe, out of all religions, Buddhism has looked death in the face the most.       They almost seem to have a science of death. I don't believe any other religion has studied the dying process and the afterdeath process so completely. I've done a lot of research on death and religion, because it's been an interest of mine since I was nine years old. (It's a long story how I went from there to here). I began to feel like if the one religion that has the most informed views of death says reincarnation is true, if science seems to have some evidence, as much as something like this can be studied scientifically, and if so many other religions believe in reincarnation, then I need to give the idea more credence. 

I also found that a deeper understanding of the Buddhist view of not-self helped me in my fear of losing myself when I reincarnated. I realized that I'm not the same person now as I was when I was five. Things that happened when I was five have impacted me. But I don't remember back when I was five. So that is how, without remembering my past lives, they can be part of this one. I am not myself now. I change moment to moment now, so, I won't lose anything if I am reborn because there is nothing to lose. 

I won't bore you with more, but I've given this a lot of thought and done some research; if you want to talk about this issue further, feel free to message me.",1704067306.0

Or that colonies are the only places to receive exonyms. Somehow you never see anyone insist that Deutschland is the only permisible term for the country.
 
> I've been seeing a lot of anti-exonym sentiment ever since Turkey ""changed their name"" a while back, and it's all completely ignorant of how loanwords and language change work.

This was especially weird, I thought, because Turkey literally isn't even an exonym. It's just the native endonym written in English orthography. It's especially obvious that using the Turkish spelling in English is inappropriate, given that it uses a letter that literally doesn't exist in the English alphabet, so it's not possible for people to spell it correctly anyway.

Yet I've seen people *vehemently insist* that ""you must never use the exonym!""... the exonym that doesn't exist.

Similarly, people are willing to insist that ""Niger must only ever be pronounced 'nee-zhair'"", yet they never say the same thing about Paris and 'paree'. If anything the anglicized pronunciation of Niger is even more than that of Paris, given that the country of Niger is named after the Niger River, which also runs through Nigeria, which is an English-speaking country.

The fact that people are so willing to advocate for disparate treatment of foreign names/peoples based on perception of them being 'other' is deeply troubling.",1704067306.0

Hi /u/Becca_lat!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

>####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

>* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

>* Don't post or claim to know the person(s) in the photo. This is a bannable offense.

>* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

**Before you begin:**

# * New and low karma accounts cannot be verified.

* If you've only been on reddit for a short time, have low karma, and/or you haven't done much NSFW self-posting on reddit, you'll be asked to build up your posting history for a month or so before verifying here. Posting nudes isn't for everyone, and we want you to ""get your feet wet"" by posting in some smaller subs before you jump into the deep end of the pool.

# * **WE DO NOT VERIFY MALE-RUN ACCOUNTS**

---
        
#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

* Show as much of your body as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to show your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude body.

* Upload the images to catbox.moe, lensdump.com, or redgifs.com. DO NOT UPLOAD THEM TO IMGUR.COM, THEY NO LONGER ALLOW NSFW CONTENT!!

* **COPY THE IMAGE LINKS AND PASTE THEM INTO THE BODY OF YOUR [MESSAGE TO THE MODERATORS](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMilf&amp;subject=Verification%20Request).**

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","A lot of Survivor mains assume the killer is being sweaty when most of the time it be you or your teammates making stupid plays and the killer capitalizing off of them. When you play both sides you notice a lot more. Going for saves when you‚Äôre injured with a killer that is really good at closing the gap of distance. Hiding nearby assuming the killer can‚Äôt hear you(injured or not some survivors are allowed). Yeah the killers going to drop the survivor or if they have mad grit or iron grasp they‚Äôre going to hit you. Then the other players assumed damn this killer was being toxic trying to go for sweaty 4K. When it‚Äôs like no your teammate made a terrible decision. 

That from the survivor perspective the team is behaving perfectly fine. Like they have synergy and they‚Äôre working well. They don‚Äôt know that someone is teabagging you or pointing at you. On the flipside that killer has no way of knowing if you guys just have good chemistry and play together well. Or if you‚Äôre playing as SWFs sometimes it‚Äôs obvious sometimes it truly isn‚Äôt. So sometimes they do go extra hard because if it is SWF that means they‚Äôre communicating so you have to think a little bit more about your place. It‚Äôs not being spread. It‚Äôs just assuming your opponent is working with information you don‚Äôt have.   

Also you might think the team is working well together. But an actuality the team is playing horribly. Lol survivors aren‚Äôt going for saves fast enough, Not working on the near finish generators,  healing people when they have the chance too, or healing when they don‚Äôt have the time. It might seem like the team is working together really well. But from the survivor side I‚Äôve had many matches where we and we damn well shouldn‚Äôt have. Simply because the match was just so incredibly frustrating. And that‚Äôs not even really a shot at the killer skill. It‚Äôs just sometimes the game is unbalanced like that where often somebody wins not because of the skill level. But because the map, the killer, and the perks on both sides came together and the right way.",1704067306.0

 (consider putting a barrier in-between the cold item and his booty, like a very very thin dish towel etc, too thick of barrier can make it worse since it can just make the doggo impatient waiting for the cold to fully penetrate through.)
 
 This will take a couple tries to get him comfy with it, so don't push it, but def be comforting about it as this will help tons in the meantime until the vet appointment. 
 
Taking down any swelling will help more than anything else, which is what this will do, esp since there could easily be swelling on the interior booty that you can't see and thus the ice pack will help with it.

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","I'm a sucker for Radagon and the Elden Beast, it gives me so much nostalgia for Dark Souls.

Did you know; the entire world of Dark Souls is built upon a concept similar to Yggdrasil, the world tree? When you go down to Ash Lake, the other trees (remnants of the Archtrees) you see in the distance are offshoots of the World-Tree's roots. This idea culminates in Dark Souls 3; the Kiln of the First Flame is located in the hollow of the Great Tree after the First Flame burned it all down.

I also believe that, in a metaphysical sense, the various root offshoots hold up the worlds of other players, much like how the masts in the Hunter's Dream indicate other Hunter's Dreams' that are inhabited by other players.

Within the Erdtree, much like the Kiln of the First Flame, is Radagon. And Radagon, as the Elden Lord, stands upon an anvil. The arena you fight in is an anvil.

The Elden Beast fight hits upon the Ash Lake feeling all over again; you have ascended to the Realm of the Gods. You stand upon the a lake, with a million Erdtrees around you. And each Erdtree has another Tarnished, becoming Elden Lord in their own right.

The idea of Causality is CRUCIAL to Elden Ring; Time is important.

And to slay a God, you must become unbound from the world. Gods are not bound by time, so to fight the Elden Beast, you are beyond the world. Beyond time. Each of those trees is another billion possibilities-- but you stand here, before the Elden Beast, more powerful than the World itself.",1704067307.0

Before that I would either rationalize it in my head, get distracted and busy with other things or let others like my family or elders gaslight me out of thinking about it.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","And even here I would argue that the congestion in the table this season is an anomaly and stems from the top teams, the usual suspects unusual profligacy in securing the points they normally would. Just look at the number of games they have dropped points in. It's more than 1/3 for all of them.

So IMO it's more down to the champions elects dropping down a level than the other contenders truly challenging them. And that's precisely why I feel that when the Cities etc. of the world eventually hit their gear and gather steam, they would shirk off and completely leave in the dust, the pretenders like the early season hype that was Tottenham or the fairytale that is Villa.

Even though I still feel Girona would eventually lose out (perhaps there's bias and hope in that statement as well), I'm yet to get that vibe from any unfancied side in the Premier League bar only perhaps Arsenal.

Girona are clearly overperforming on the statsheet but that's not the impression you get from the eye test. Take their game away at Barcelona for instance. xG of 2 vs 4 eventually but if you looked at the game, there was only ever one winner with the best result for Barcelona appearing to be a draw at around the hour mark but they were denied only by Gund√∂gan's unfathomable failure to score. He didn't have an open net or anything but from the number of quality chances he had in that 15 minute spell and the quality of player he is, he should have put away at least one. But the pattern of the game was such that Girona was playing conservatively to defend a lead. However any time they ventured forward, they were tactically so superior and in conjunction, Barcelona was absolutely abject and shambolic defensively, that they created high quality chances every attack and Barcelona was only at their mercy rather than being able to prevent a goal.

In fact, the fact that we wrestled back the crown of the ""winter champions"" and the fashion we did it in has spared them all the media pressure and subsequent expectation in this fortnight where there's no football and all talk. Despite the fact that we are level on points, they can still enjoy being the hunter than the very unfamiliar hunted and this IMO only shores up their challenge.

In a similar vein, while everyone is out with their knives, I think this is a boon for Arsenal. You have such a spell at some point of your season irrespective of who you are. Slipping down to fourth from the top in a week is just the wake up call they might need and the stumble is early enough in the season for them to re-gather their wits about them, instead of confirming their demise at the business end.",1704067307.0

"TheWayHomeHallmark","t5_7tasb3","Thanks for the question! Honestly, I need to watch the last few episodes again, however, I think that Colton did not recognize Kat during the grief groups, because during those sessions he was focused on Jacob and the grief and trauma he was feeling at that time. And he was trying to heal himself, so he would be able to mend his strained relationship with Del. Also, Colton had met Kat in an earlier episode at the Landry property, I think maybe right after Kat first jumped in the pond, and then when they meet again at the grief group, Kat introduces herself as someone else. So this may have caused Colton to associate Kat as this new woman and not as his daughter, because Del and Colton would not have know what their grown-up daughter would have looked like at that time; as referenced by Del not knowing that Kat was the ""other woman"" at Colton's funeral. 

I think Colton only recognized Kat when he was dying, as his life was flashing before his eyes, so to speak. In some new photos from Season 2, Del and Kat are shown standing with a man in a dusty room of either a museum or an old mansion and in the trailer for Season 2, Kat is shown, in a similar looking room, looking up at the portrait of herself with the caption underneath of ""My Katherine, 1814."" I'm not sure where this place is exactly, but if the Landry family once owned this portrait and Colton grew up looking at it and it was then donated to this place or if he went to this place and saw the portrait or had heard stories about this mystic ""Katherine""; this could explain why he then recognized Kat as he was dying. He was lying on the roadside looking up at her like he would have seen the picture and that was when he called her ""My Katherine,"" maybe this flashed through his mind as he was dying, either that or the writer's just wrote it in for dramatic effect and I've built this story up for nothing. :)

- there's lots of great packs, but I realised I never actually used anything in a song. Ever.

- packs are more like ""micro-songs"", stemmed out. This is more common in sample packs nowadays. They fit together, but didn't find much use for them outside that context.

- I thought the tinestretchibg algorithm was poor. Don't bother using anything much beyond b d tge original tempo. It artefacts very easily. Sounds are also drenched in FX, I dissect to hide this a bit.

- forxwgatevercreason, it hogged my system when downloading multiple packs. Literally couldn't do anything else unless I only fownliaded one thing at a time.

- was excited about Arcade when it first came out, have all the ither Output Kontskt stuff. But I found it lacking. I much prefer Loopcloud in breadth and scope,  better implementation. Also uses Zynsptics time and pitch algorithms which are far more transparent b sparent.

Plus the socialization aspect is overrated anyway. It seems like your frustration lies primarily with the teachers and/or administrators but if your kid is having a hard time learning with his peers then he's going to struggle to socialize with them as well. I'm not saying it's not a worthwhile life skill to learn to socialize with people unlike yourself but socializing with them exclusively for 8 hours a day just for the sake of socialization itself is hardly any better. Team sports can be an excellent way to learn to work as part of a team with people from different backgrounds and of different ability levels.",1704067311.0

That's a lot more acceptable than bulldozing housing.

The Commuter Rail is still a plus and access to the bus terminal is desirable.  Proximity to the on ramp for the connector is a big plus if you need to drive a car, though I expect that cars will become less desirable in the next 50 years.

Actually, I don't know the details as well as you are explaining, just what I heard. 

But, the timing does matter. It is an AGM, Annual meaning what happened in that period (financial year). 

If the president represented his son at the hearing, if it was a hearing organised by APU, I agree that the president would definitely be in conflict of interest. 

But the hearing was not organised by APU, it was reported to be held by a third party. The tribunal would have lawyers or judges or legal people, which I believe is the case of any tribunal companies.  Correct me if I am wrong.  I am sure that APU president would have been kicked out if there was a conflict, as they have legal expertise manage the hearing.

Great results in tandem with a good diet, obvs. Every 4 days cavi on belly and thighs, and Rf on face. Laser on both belly and chin. I've seen about a 2"" reduction on waist and abdomen, and tightening on jowl and chin area over about a 3 month period, consistent use. You need to drink a ton of water, which I do, especially the day before, of, and after the cavitation to get the broken down/imulsified fat moving. I find taking powder [Lecithin](https://www.amazon.com/Supplements-Sunflower-Naturally-Phosphatidyl-Phosphatides/dp/B00MU73UKS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3GIEQ0XDE2W28&keywords=now+powder+lecithin&qid=1704066972&s=hpc&sprefix=now+powder+lecithin%2Chpc%2C73&sr=1-1) daily (in smoothies, or simply in water and powder electrolyte mix, extremely helpful in flushing everything out.

Walking through giant warehouses filled with deals can lead to impulse purchases of items you may not really need just because they seem like a  good deal.

It sounds like you compromised on Mackenzie's behalf and her response to that was... to get mad at you for not giving her even more? That's kind of shitty.

One way to handle this better could be to centre your own wants and needs, and decide you want to do one of:

* Decline the party and spend the night with Mackenzie, *because you want to.*
* Go to the party while Mackenzie stays home, *because you want to.*
* Do what you did, which is compromise between attending the party and spending time with Mackenzie, *because you want to.*

I was in a similar situation and it took me to way in my 40s to start figuring this stuff out. For most of my life I didn't even know asexuality was a thing. Once I started, everything fell into place. I finally knew, that I was different, how I was different and why I had problems understanding the world and the people around me.

You really are not concerned with the guy/party that ran on the slogan, ""lock her up"" in 2015, or  the guy that attempted to dig up dirt by withholding congressionally approved  aid to another country? The act of a man who could only consider himself above the will of the people if he thinks he can withhold money that our representatives votes to send. Sounds kinda dictatorial to me. The same guy that has claimed election fraud in every election he has entered even the one he actually won. I'm shocked. And I thought this was just you being partisan. In order for trump to actually be being politically persecuted at this point it would take literally the entire weight of the American government to allow it to happen without repercussion, and then it would take the entirety of the democrats to continue to let the fascism take hold. Even then it would be a stretch most Dems do nothing but trash each other the moment they are done trashing the Republicans. Now what is it the Republicans almost unanimously stopped doing after Trump became president. Criticizing each other they all of a sudden decided to fall in line behind one mans cult of personality that has not been seen even in Obama or Reagan. All it takes is to look at how often a member of the Republican party is ousted as a rhino or censured for wrong think to see which side is promoting a lack of open mindedness.  Oddly enough most of these incidents were based on simply speaking out against one person. Add to this the idea that the Republican platform for 2020 was basically one mans vision for America. The real kicker is that all this is before the demonstration in 2021 of just how far this party is willing to go to get their way. Willing to through all caution to the wind despite all losing cases to try to overturn an election that was proven to at least meet all requirements of a free and fair election in multiple courts and had it not would have been overturned in a supreme Court that has more members of the party with the grievances than the one they sides with.

TTS was supposedly what Kojima wanted to originally do in MGS1 but the tech wasnt there yet and if anyone has seen some of the cutscenes from TTS, you know theyre.. extremely over the top.

Glad we cleared that up.

The fact that there are people who cheat the system and break the law is often the tired argument why we should do away with benefits programs altogether.   Of course, using that logic, we'd need to do away with all programs and even insurance programs because there is always someone cheating or defrauding the systems that are in place. 

Even so, it takes way more than a SSN to get benefits from the government. 

You know who mostly defrauds our safety nets.  American citizens.

Our defense is so rotten that it seems like he needs to score 30+ for us to dominate. With Siakam and Lively causing chaos on the other end defensively and Luka and Kai scoring and creating like they normally do, THJ wouldn't be missed that much.

Siakam also gives us much greater paint presence, and could shift us away from die by the 3.",1704067316.0

And Bubbles helps Randy deal with it in the Jail Series by having sleepovers with Randy. And it's also a fact in Randy's Reach snd a fact in the podcasts for the last 3 years.

But we are going to find out a more detailed explanation of his live action passing in a live action sequence at the end of Animated Season 3. Where we also see them wake up in a hospital from their shared hallucination and then are told of how he really passes or something like thst. They confirmed this at one of their Expos. 

Season 3 Animated was supposed to come out 3 years ago before Jail Season 1 and Red Rocks but Season 3 Animated went into limbo. But I believe they finished it up this week. So we will find out when that comes out which will be before Season 13 cokes out.",1704067316.0

If you would indulge me, I'd like to ask about few other veteran-things, that you might have tested extensively, but remain in realm of theorycrafting for me.

First general question - how much damage is overkill for revolver? I'm looking at things like:

- various damage vs. perks ,

- various perks and blessings that increase crit chance for follow-up shots,

- Hand-Cannon blessing (60% rending on critical hit, how effective really is it, given decent base carapace dmg?),

- Superiority Complex talent (15% vs Elites) and 5% ranged dmg on the way to it, possibly also weak spot damage and/or deadshot?

And if some of that damage is not needed, what do you prefer for revolver? Run'n'Gun sounds fun, Terrifying Barrage could be great or awful, Gloryhunter seems solid...

How accurate is revolver? Is crosshair / indicator correct, or is it misleading?

How important is survivalist assuming I have to share ammo with the rest of the team?

When you talk about breakpoints, what passive damage nodes are you taking? There's quite a bit of them.

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

"therewasanattempt","t5_39ne7","In case you accidentally wander into a voting booth one day, there are some things you should know, and one of them is that there is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world. We're seventh in literacy, twenty-seventh in math, twenty-second in science, forty-ninth in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, number four in labor force, and number four in exports. We lead the world in only three categories: number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend more than the next twenty-six countries combined, twenty-five of whom are allies. So when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about?! Yosemite?!!!

We sure used to be. We stood up for what was right! We fought for moral reasons, we passed and struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed, we cared about our neighbors, we put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest. We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, and we acted like men. We aspired to intelligence; we didn't belittle it; it didn't make us feel inferior. We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election, and we didn't scare so easy. And we were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed. By great men, men who were revered. The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one‚ÄîAmerica is not the greatest country in the world anymore.

Creepy-Secretary4053, please write a comment explaining any work that you post. The work‚Äôs objective, its audience, your design decisions, attribute credit, etc. This information is necessary to allow people to understand your project and provide valuable feedback. **All Sharing Work posts are now hidden by default**. [To make it public, please message modmail requesting a review](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/graphic_design).

##Providing Useful Feedback

Creepy-Secretary4053 has posted their work for feedback. Here are some top tips for posting high-quality feedback.

* Read their context comment. All work on this sub should have a comment explaining the thinking behind the piece. Read this before posting 
to understand what Creepy-Secretary4053 was trying to do.

* Be professional. No matter your thoughts on the work, respect the effort put into making it and be polite when posting. 

* Be constructive and detailed. Short, vague comments are unhelpful. Instead of just leaving your opinion on the piece, explore *why* you hold that opinion: what makes the piece good or bad? How could it be improved? Are some elements stronger than others?

* Remember design fundamentals. If your feedback is focused on basic principles of design such as hierarchy, flow, balance, and proportion, it will be universally useful. And remember that this is graphic design: the piece should communicate a message or solve a 
problem. How well does it do that?

* Stay on-topic. We know that design can sometimes be political or controversial, but please keep comments focussed on the design itself, 
and the strengths/weaknesses thereof.

"StarWarsCantina","t5_ge6kz",">I think it's quite telling within one movie of TLJ they have the do exposition about how they can't do that move ever again.

Right, cause death star 3.0 was so much better? 

>I don't understand, don't they have a whole fleet of X-Wings 

Okay seriously? When was the last time you watched this movie. The opening scene is about Poe losing their entire fleet of X-wings and bombers.

The Canto Blight sequence shows why and how the Resistance isn't getting as much funding or as good of supplies as the first order. 

In the final battle on Crait they're using broken down old Rebellion era tech because they have nothing else left 

They call for reinforcements and nobody shows up except for Luke. 

The entire point of the movie is that the Resistence are down to their very last people, ships and supplies. After the destruction of the New Republic at the hands of Starkiller base in 7, they no longer have any protection from the First Order. 

That's why in episode 9, at the end of the film, a fleet doesn't show up, because there's none left. No new republic army, no resistance army, so the Galaxy stands up in numbers, just having random ships show up from everywhere as a stand against the Final Order.

I'm glad you've realized most atheists like you do borrow from Christian values to somewhat understand what is right and what is wrong however you deliberately cherry pick what you want to believe is right and wrong according to Christian values.

"fuckcars","t5_3cs2l","honestly, not a fan, because it's unrealistic.

1. where do you plan to build this? most street grids are rectangular, so this will likely be a greenfield project, with no nearby necessities. I'll assume that since you said ""mixed use"", the plan is to have the building include grocery stores, retail, healthcare, and third places. However, executing will be incredibly difficult, since living there won't be desirable until those necessities are there, and businesses won't open there until there's enough demand to support them.
2. tall buildings require more material to support. We don't need super tall buildings to have density. Just the outermost ring of the bottom layer (looks like around 240 housing units) gives a population density of about 27k / sq.km, which is dense enough to fit the entire world's population in Montana. This includes 40 - 80 sqm (400-800 sqft) of public space per unit.

We got our base rules from a popular image that has been floating around the internet for a while (rules 1-12) but we added a few house rules.  We play exclusively with beer because alcohol poisoning is no joke, and when we want to play more casually, we play that you only call rules when you feel like drinking (we still end up pretty lit)  
1. Close up of the ring

2. Panoramic scenery shot

3. Merry & Pippin get up to shenanigans

4. Frodo wanders off from the group

5. Gandalf goes serious wizard mode

6. Intimate moment between Frodo and Sam

7. Legolas doesn't understand emotions or says something obvious

8. Frodo looks like he's jazzing himself

9. Entire fellowship onscreen (kind of useless after FotR, but gets you good during the movie)

10. Aragorn does something badass

11. Legolas stares off into the distance

12. The ring is referred to as ""Precious""

HOUSE RULES

13. Every time Gimli is the most relatable character

14. The quality of Faramir is either called into question or proven beyond a doubt

15. If someone onscreen partakes in Longbottom Leaf, we also spark up.  This eventually turned into ""if anything is getting lit up onscreen"" which includes the beacons in RotK.

16. Of course if someone onscreen is getting their drink on, we follow suit.

So, I am finally into the degree and working on my third course (Social Psychology). SNHU accepted me to the program but required the prerequisites, which was a big part of my decision to attend SNHU, as other programs (i.e. ASU) required certain undergrad courses before being considered for their master's program. I don't fault ASU for the requirement, but it made it harder for me to return and get the undergrad credits as a non-degree-seeking student.  


The SNHU I/O Psych degree content is very interesting and has been immediately applicable in my current job as a user experience researcher.

I'm sorry if your country is terrible but we can't take in the entire world, if they can't even be bothered to attempt to get here legally then they need to go, kids and all. And we also need to get rid of the anchor baby system because that is going to destroy our country. We can't have millions of people per year (2022 had 3 million official illegals that got caught and then released into our country, that's just the ones that were caught, it is an even higher number that made it through the border without being caught) coming over here, having a baby and then get automatic citizenship, we as a country can't handle these many illegals.

 This is a very real threat to our country that people dont seem to be taking as seriously as they should. This is going to absolutely SCREW the Democrats in the next election because they are the only party pushing hard for these illegals to come here.

Pro Tips:

1) replace the key fob battery and the fob performance will be better. I recommend just sticking with using the fob NFC for lock/unlock for now. It works 100% of the time and is the fastest. I never use App unlock. 

2) If you‚Äôre using the key fob button to unlock, press it once - the car interior lights will have illuminated letting you know it is waking up - wait at least 4 seconds - then hit unlock again. Pressing unlock twice too fast will cause a delay unlocking. 

3) if any cameras/sensors give you an error, do a hard reset and everything will be working fine after. (this has been my experience)

4) it‚Äôs been a long road coming but the next update in January should be key to fixing some of these little issues. Otherwise you‚Äôre going to love it! Enjoy!",1704067323.0

My dad put all his possessions in his girlfriend‚Äôs name and then filed for bankruptcy. We literally got kicked out of our house.

My mom (a SAHM for the majority of my younger years) was the one who had filed and my dad tried everything under the sun to push her over and force custody so he wouldn‚Äôt pay child support (note: he was an awful man, neither one of us wanted to go with him. We were just a bargaining chip to hurt our mother). He intentionally got fired from him job and ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt get another job‚Äù to avoid paying support and force the amount incredibly low (and still never paid).

My mom checked the mail at our old house every now and then and his tax documents came in. The new owner accidentally opened the mail already, because funnily enough, her husband‚Äôs name was the same as my dad. My mom was able to prove he was bother employed and actually made more than he claimed even before his unemployment.

Especially with the toxic hookup environment we have where so much is come and go, there aren't as many opportunities for both people involved to sit and chat about their individual needs and interests (speaking from the perspective of being young at one point and inexperienced).

I played my 2nd Consular as a young Jedi thrust into a world way above her head. I imagined what a young, malleable person might do in their situation. Making grey decisions to influence the greater good. I don't think full dark side works on *any* of the Republic characters because the story is so black-and-white. You wouldn't continue to get promoted if you did evil stuff. The Jedi would be able to see your true motives. But equally they would be able to allow certain behaviour to slip (think wiping Revan's mind and their experiments on Malachor V)

The Smuggler can be played Dark side as a crime lord, but ultimately doesn't work because of the shoehorned story. Why would my crime lord pirate be able to walk around Fleet without getting arrested?   
Same with the Consular. Yes, you can make dark decisions to influence negotiations but you can't outright kill your own people or go full Dark side and *still* be promoted to Jedi Master. It just doesn't make sense",1704067326.0

"askcarsales","t5_2vhkv","I have never seen one out of hundreds of third party warranty claims ever cover the whole cost of repair. However I have seen ford premium care consistently cover the repair to the fullest extent 99% of the time. 3rd party warranties are good when you go to an approved vendor or the dealer that sold it because they have a contract that obligates them to eat costs to make the customers deductible. But most dealers are not gonna be an approved vendor so if you have to get an engine or something major you‚Äôre screwed. It‚Äôs pretty uniform - all third party warranties are like that. It‚Äôs not the salesman fault tho, they probably do believe in the 3rd party warranties.

A large number of (almost always female) posters will often find themselves getting a number of chat requests and/or direct messages - oftentimes vulgar or inappropriate. We encourage you to ping the mod team with screenshots - they will be permanently banned. You can also temporarily disable chat and DMs. We feel like this should go without saying, but messaging minors is also not okay. It will result in a report to the admins which more often than not will lead to the loss of your account. DO NOT MESSAGE ANY POSTERS FROM OUR COMMUNITY.

A few notes, if you post (or comment) in this subreddit and you have an OnlyFans account, or if you have posted links to OnlyFans elsewhere on Reddit, our automatic moderation bot will flag your account and you will be banned - we are kid-friendly and E-rated and due to the incessant spamming by literally hundreds of people before you, we've been forced to moderate this subreddit this way. This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.


Please do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.


Please REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.


We will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting someone else's photo. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).


Do not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. We do take action when comments/posts are reported... give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.


Any other questions? You can always send your mod team a mail message.

More local to me, it hits most of the popular outdoor spots on Capitol Hill, including many parks. The noise is bad and frequent enough that it really makes you not want to take a walk or even open windows.

I assume you found this thread through Google, as it is a top hit, which is unfortunate as I'd prefer to have found local campaigns to stop flights directly over major Seattle populations. To make things worse, we seem intent on expanding Seatac and adding more flights, so it is likely to get worse from here.

Hagrid is a trusting individual but I dont think he gives away his respect away easily and I think his comments indicate that he did respect James. Dumbledore, as well. Now of course these comments are given to Harry, and it would make sense given the audience what kind of comments you would make about his deceased father. But they also didnt hide that James got into trouble regularly. I think that Hagrid and Dumbledore are much more reliable narrators than Remus and Sirius.

But all of that is why I brought up the other evidence - that somehow Lily fell in love with him, and everything we know about her character indicates she probably wouldnt unless he changed; that he somehow becomes head boy despite being a major rule breaker. Dumbledore would not assign that to James if he hadnt changed.

Also the very first chapter of the series - McGonnagall, who is often quite stern, is rather upset that they died. She clearly thinks highly of both James and Lily.",1704067329.0

"GBO2","t5_mdtp1","Just to be clear of confusion, it's the one in A, the Gelgoog Cannon (JN) 

It's primarily the upgrades made to its main gun, the sniper rifle. On top of having the cooldown be reduced to under 1 second, it receives piercing on focused shots and can focus quicker from 4 seconds to 3 after the buff.  The rigidity tidbit is a bit confusing, but basically it lets you switch to other guns more smoothly, preferably the bazooka after you shoot an MA suit once or twice with the sniper, the build stun from the bazooka will stop them. 

High performance scope LV4 is another thing it got, which further increases the scope's visual but unlike the earlier levels, also increases your turn speed while scoped in. But as mentioned, it being well regarded here has nothing to do with whether it'll perform good on the field. Mid line works best unless you completely disregard the shoulder bazooka for long ranged sniping only.",1704067330.0

"consciousness","t5_2qktt","A model is abstract. An implementation is a physical structure which the model accurately describes. I can give you a model for how a computer calculates the multiplication of two binary numbers. You cannot use the model itself to run the calculation. You must assemble physical objects in such a way that abides by the model's description.  
  
You can also create a model of something that already exists. A model of the weather does not cause rain. However, the atmosphere can produce rain, because it is a physical structure. The way the atmosphere produces rain is described by the model. You can make a map of land that already exists, or you can use a blueprint to build a house. Either way, the map/blueprint will not have all of the properties of the land/house that it describes.

A model of the brain is not the same as the physical brain. The model can describe how the brain will produce consciousness, but consciousness will not emerge until there is a physical brain engaged in the process that produces consciousness.

Why does a brain have a particular perspective? For the same reason that a rock has a particular frame of reference for its motion. It is a physical object that is finite in space and time. The neurons and regions of the brain are connected to each other in a way that they are not connected to most other things in the universe. Why does a camera have a particular vantage point? Same reason. It is a physical object that is finite in space and time. It interacts with the incoming light in a way that it does not interact with light that does not enter its lens. Why does my computer contain only the information that is input into it? Because it interacts with its inputs in a way that it does not interact with other events.",1704067331.0

"longhair","t5_2rrd8","I have wavy 2C hair that's very long as well. Curly Girl Method works very well for me, but some people with wavy hair finds it weighs their hair down too much. 

My routine is: I did one initial clarifying shampoo to get rid of build up, then after that I only use conditioner. I like Maui Moisture Curl Quench + Coconut oil Curl-Defining Anti-Frizz Conditioner (the orange bottle). I just massage it into my scalp like shampoo and rinse it out, then apply more to the length of my hair, let it sit for a few minutes, and rinse. Before showering I apply jojoba oil (about a tablespoon) to my hair, especially on the ends, and gently comb through it. I try to avoid combing or brushing as much as possible. The conditioner removes all the excess oil. I find as long as it's not too dry, then it doesn't tangle much, but I also keep it up a lot just for practical reasons, but it does protect it too.

I used to plop my hair in a t-shirt after showering, but to be honest my hair gets in the way so much at its current length that I have it up in a hairclip 90% of the time anymore. When I did plop to style, I would lean over so my hair was upside down and scrunch flaxseed gel through it. Using a large bowl made this a lot easier and kept my hair off the shower floor. There are lots of great videos on how to do this on youtube. 

So basically, I use 3 ingredients: Maui conditioner ($8 a bottle), jojoba oil (bought inexpensively on Amazon), and flaxseed gel on special occasions, which can be made very cheaply from flaxseeds from the grocery store. Some people with wavy hair may need a lighter conditioner (Maui has other options for this).",1704067331.0

"FinancialPlanning","t5_2qwze","* Whether you pay cash or finance it highly depend on the interest rate. Higher than 6 or 7% and I'd personally pay cash. Why? See below response on the mortgage. If rates drop in the future, you could always just pay it off later if you want.
* Yes, max out your 401k moving forward. increasing your 401k will not mean an equal reduction in paystubs. So if you increase your contributions by 500, your paychecks don't go down by 500, it's more likely 300 ish (just a rough guestimate)
* Everyone on this sub HATES debt for some reason. This is more of a phycological thing than a financial thing. Financially speaking, paying off a 5.25% mortgage when it's only 1-2% above the risk free rate makes zero sense. You can toss that money into the Vanguard settlement fund and make 5.32% right now. That means your effective rate on the mortgage is zero, but now you have the cash on hand instead of locking it up in your home in case of emergency. Would you rather have cash or home equity? In reality, I personally wouldn't put it in a MM fund at your age, I would invest it in something like VTI. Over the life of your Loan, it's all but certain that VTI will beat 5.25%, and very likely double it.
   * I also wouldn't pay off her loans for the sole reason that they are not yours. Maybe when you're married, but not before. But similar to the mortgage response from above, the rate is too low to consider paying off. You're better off paying the minimums and investing the rest.
* I'm not sure what answer you are looking for here. Why did you buy your house? This money shouldn't change that at all.
* Well this money will certainly help. I think you will help your net worth significantly more investing the money as opposed to paying off your mortgage. But regardless, keep maxing things like IRA's, 401ks, and HSA's, and you will be able to retire early.",1704067334.0

What got Noir killed was he betrayed Homelander in the worst way possible: he got between Homelander and a potential father figure, something Homelander had been wanting for years. Anyone else would've been tortured for hours but Homelander gave Noir a relatively quick death and had tears in his eyes doing it. That speaks for how much he liked him.",1704067335.0

"de","t5_22i0","Mir fallen 2 Argumente f√ºr die Fahrenheit-Skala ein:

- Die Skala ist breiter gestreut. Das f√ºhrt dazu, dass man eher ohne Dezimalstellen auskommt, was gerade bei Sachen wie Fieber hilfreich sein kann, weil 0.5¬∞C schon den Unterschied zwischen ""normal"" und ""Fieber"" sein k√∂nnen. Das ist es leichter zu sagen, 99¬∞F sind normal und 100¬∞F sind Fieber.

- Fahrenheit ist in Bezug auf das Wetter in unseren Breitengraden im Endeffekt eine Antwort auf die Frage ""Wie warm ist es?"" auf einer Skala von 0-100. 0¬∞F sind ca. -18¬∞C, was ungef√§hr die k√§ltesten Wintertemperaturen bei uns sind und 100¬∞F sind ca. 38¬∞C, was ungef√§hr die hei√üesten Sommertemperaturen sind. Die Mitte, also 50¬∞F entspricht also einem normalen Fr√ºhlings/Herbsttag (10¬∞C).

Klar, wenn man Wissenschaft betreiben wil, dann hat die Celsius-Skala durch die Korrespondenz zu anderen SI-Einheiten und den Siede-/Gefrierpunkt klare Vorteile. Im t√§glichen Umgang (bis auf Kochen/Backen) ist die Fahrenheit-Skala m.M.n. aber tats√§chlich intuitiver und deutlich praktischer als andere US-Einheiten wie Inch, Ounce usw.",1704067336.0

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Juan_Hill#Kettle_Hill

It was the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers.

>Under continuous fire, the advance slowed as troops dropped from heat exhaustion. Officers from the rest of Wood's brigade, along with Carroll's, bunched up under fire. When the regulars of the all-black Buffalo Soldiers punched toward the top of the hill, the units became intermingled. One of the 10th's officers who took part in the attack, 1st Lieutenant John J. ""Black Jack"" Pershing, would later reach the highest rank ever held in the United States Army by a living officer‚ÄîGeneral of the Armies of the United States. Pershing later recalled that:

>>    ...the entire command moved forward as coolly as though the buzzing of bullets was the humming of bees. White regiments, black regiments, regulars and Rough Riders [i.e. volunteers], representing the young manhood of the North and the South, fought shoulder to shoulder, unmindful of race or color, unmindful of whether commanded by ex-Confederate or not, and mindful of only their common duty as Americans.

>When the American formations (10th, 3rd, and 1st Volunteers) reached the summit of Kettle Hill, they briefly fought hand to hand within the Spanish defensive works, at which point the Spanish retreated. ***Most reports name the first American soldier to reach the crest of Kettle Hill as Sgt. George Berry of the 10th Cavalry, who took both the 10th and 3rd Cavalry battle flags to the summit.*** This is supported in the writings of Pershing, who fought with the 10th on Kettle Hill and who was present when Col. Roosevelt reached the top. Politics and racial discrimination led to many myths about the African-American involvement in the fighting in Cuba.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_Cavalry_Regiment_(United_States)

https://history.army.mil/html/documents/wwspain/buffalos_sjh/schubert.html

>Critics have complained that Roosevelt erroneously and undeservedly claimed credit for the victory at San Juan Hill, when he actually was involved in the assault on Kettle Hill. In fact, he did play a prominent role in the fight for Kettle Hill. His volunteers, part of Sumner's dismounted cavalry force, reached the top of Kettle Hill alongside black and white regulars. The actions of Color Sgt. George Berry of the 10th Cavalry, who carried the colors of the white 3d Cavalry up that hill along with his own regiment's standard, reflected the shared nature of the operation, with black and white regulars and Rough Riders fighting side by side and with one group sometimes indistinguishable from the others. 

>Once Roosevelt reached the top of Kettle Hill, he watched Kent's troops begin to overrun their objective on San Juan Hill. ***Still eager for a fight, he urged the men around him to follow him into the fray on San Juan. That's when he found out what happens when you sound a charge and nobody comes. Only a handful of soldiers heard the great man, and he found himself at the head of an assault that consisted of five soldiers. Roosevelt retreated, regrouped, and assembled a more respectable force that reached the Spanish trenches in time to participate in the last of the fight.*** ""There was,"" he said, ""very great confusion at this time, the different regiments being completely intermingled-white regulars, colored regulars, and Rough Riders."" 

>***Almost one hundred years passed before the nation rediscovered the Buffalo Soldiers. The process started with the 1967 publication of William Leckie's The Buffalo Soldiers and culminated in 1992, with the dedication by General Colin Powell of the Buffalo Soldier statue at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. For the Buffalo Soldiers, ""the American century"" is ending the way it had started.*** In a period of increasing informal segregation, growing dissatisfaction with affirmative action, and the spreading emphasis on a separate African-American minority culture, books, plays, movies, and even phone cards celebrate the service of these troopers. In what appears to be a disconcertingly similar setting of deteriorating race relations, the Buffalo Soldiers have returned to take their place among America's heroes.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","I'm sorry that you're lonely. It's so frustrating for me as a guy who has experienced a lot of loneliness to read posts like this and know that so many of my friends (or even myself) could have avoided all the pain if we'd just shot our shot!!!! that being said, you asked why men avoid women they like. Here are 4 potential reasons:  
**1.** Pretty women are terrifying. If she rejects us, it means we're ugly losers (at least, that's how men think). I'd rather go my whole life wondering if I'm an ugly loser than have it proven to me without a doubt by a woman I find attractive. Schrodinger's cat.   
**2.** Risky. In a day and age where women are encouraged to just make crap up about men and say whatever they want to make them feel good about themselves, it can be risky approaching a girl unless we know for certain she likes us. A good example of this is the TikTok trend ""[delulu is the solulu](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2023/09/21/is-delulu-really-the-solulu-a-psychologist-explores-the-new-tiktok-trend/?sh=466b7cc47196)"". Modern women truly are their own new animal.   
**3.** It is most men's experience that, unless the girl overtly expresses indirect interest (i.e., obviously flirting with us, finding ways to spend time with us, inviting us to hang out, etc.) then us approaching a girl who seems disinterested seems desperate and is a turn off to pretty much every woman watching including the girl we like. But when we act aloof, and a girl gives us attention and then we reciprocate, we don't seem like we're desperate to get a girl and we tend to succeed in those relationships better. It's just a matter of experience. 

**4.** We literally have no clue what to say or do. Believe it or not, most men have never been in a relationship. We don't know how to sail this damn ship anymore than ya'll do lol! So, rather than volunteering to take the wheel only to embarrass ourselves by crashing and burning, we would rather just sit back and wait... for what? we don't always know. A sign. We think we'll know it when we see it. But we rarely actually do. It's frustrating being a man.   


Hopefully the lesson from this is that if you like a guy, put yourself in his space. Flirt with him. Overtly. Don't be a slut, but tell him he looks good. Stand by him whenever you can. Toss your hair, laugh at every joke he cracks. Some playful physical contact like pushing his arm when you laugh goes a long way. And if between 2 weeks or 1 month he hasn't asked you out, drop him like a brick and move on.",1704067336.0

"skiing","t5_2qig7","Depending on the visual impairment and level of skiing, there are a ton of methods. While learning, adaptive skiers will have two or more instructors, all with adaptive ski certifications. 

Tethering (where the adaptive skier wears a harness or belt, and the instructor has two reigns to guide the adaptive skier) is often used when beginning. Long guide poles can be used, where an instructor holds each end of a long PVC pole with the adaptive skier holding the pole in the middle. 

More intermediate / advanced skiers might just need an audio guide ‚Äî usually a friend or relative ‚Äî who can call out turns and terrain.

If the adaptive skier isn‚Äôt fully blind, but suffers from a visual impairment, they may just need the help of a visual guide ‚Äî someone to follow down the mountain. Adaptive skiers and instructors typically wear high visibility vests with clear identification: big lettering with something like ‚ÄúVISUALLY IMPAIRED SKIER‚Äù or ‚ÄúBLIND SKIER GUIDE‚Äù. 

There are options for people of all ages and ability levels to get out and have fun on the snow.

"ExNoContact","t5_319jr","What your ‚Äúex‚Äù (if you can even consider him that, considering he doesn‚Äôt even deserve that title) did was absolutely terrible. In my opinion, I think it‚Äôs easy to tell why you‚Äôre still attached to him, and it has to do with the fact that he took your virginity (which is a HUGE huge deal) and than left you high and dry after it. Both of those actions are very very big deals. Losing your virginity to somebody is almost automatically going to create some type of attachment to them, even if it‚Äôs just simply caring a little more about them, because that‚Äôs SUCH a private thing to do with somebody, especially for the first time. Although 6 months might not be super long, it‚Äôs still half a year and that‚Äôs 6 months of getting to know each other more and more and spending more time with each other, which again, creates attachment and is going to make you care more and more about them. You said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get why I can‚Äôt get over him when he treated me so badly‚Äù, but I think that‚Äôs part of it. See, he treated you very badly and didn‚Äôt seem to leave you with any kind of closure or apology or even an explanation, and that can seriously take a toll on somebody moving on from somebody and having the ability to finally remove that person from their life even if they‚Äôre not physically there, but in one‚Äôs mind.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It only looks like an unpopular opinion not because people hate linearity or think its inherently bad, but simply because games are the only narrative medium that can offer the alternative, so anytime they don't it feels like a lost opportunity.

It's like if most movies were actually just audio books - that doesn't mean audio books are bad, quite the contrary lots of them are amazing, but it's the only medium where we can get moving pictures. If someone feels like following moving pictures is overwhelming then they should get an audio book, but I get it, the ""movie-book"" as a few pictures that show on screen which you wouldn't get if you were just straight up listening to an audiobook so going there for your story instead would feel less than a moviebook, but you can't really blame people for being slightly annoyed that not enough movies have moving pictures.

Like, seriously, how many big quality games exists where *you can actually influence the plot of the game*? 12? Even then that'd be generous. How many great games are linear? 1000? 

That's why us ""branching stories"" fans are so vocal, we're the underdog, that's why we *have to argue that games with narrative design could be great* because otherwise everybody knows linear games can be great, they're the status quo. It's weird that people feel the need to argue ""linear games can be good too"" like yeah no shit of course they can orherwise every single game wouldn't be.",1704067339.0

This is considered a core conservative requirement, traditions must be handed down directly through the generations, as traditions are a critical asset of society, and must be respected for society to survive.

That was a bigger issue earlier, especially before education could pass down critical skills without the generational link, but we need to re-evaluate the place of tradition in the modern world.",1704067340.0

There are patients that want these devices out but the pain management docs won‚Äôt remove, or have closed up shop and rode into the sunset, and other surgeons won‚Äôt touch these surgeries. Can‚Äôt blame them, not FDA approved and someone else‚Äôs mess. Pain management make big $ on these procedures. Treat patients like criminals and they don‚Äôt make much $ just writing a prescription with follow up 4x/ year
Oh, the fact that there Is a shortage of opioids meds with even further cut backs to production next year is a huge problem. Frig there‚Äôs a urologist talking about opioids free kidney removal.  Women with mastectomies or hysterectomies being sent home without pain meds but told take Tylenol or Aleve. It‚Äôs really bad out there. I would not touch elective surgeries right now because the surgeons are eliminating/cutting way back on post op pain treatment.

If you feel the need to thirst after someone you are aware of as a minor, either visually or after being told, check yourself. Maybe get that looked at.

People do be getting awfully protective of some lines and soild colors.

If you're thirsting hard for a fictional minor, let it be known you are the weird one here. Perhaps consider why it's weird and why you're making other people uncomfortable. But at the same time, check on whether your response actually fits the crime or if you're taking a step too far into ""defending the honor"" of a drawing like they're actually flesh and blood.

Sound is completely lacking in a specific aesthetic, which all of the established typings have, and most of the existing mons who would apply already have double typing. They definitely won‚Äôt change existing typings, but will add a second type to established mons, changing a type would be too complicated and make the new game lose any backwards compatibility. 

Cosmic is too ambiguous and is sort of already covered by ultra beasts, which have typings all over the map. I can‚Äôt really picture how it would fit in with the world, I can only think of one non legendary, non UB who might take the typing. You would essentially have to add legit Pokemon aliens and it‚Äôs too open ended, and lacks lore.

Crystal has an easy to establish aesthetic, a solid elemental basis, and could be easily tied to different mythology/lore, which most pokemon are based around. Plus, we could finally get a real Crystal Onyx as a new regional!",1704067342.0

"FFVIIRemake","t5_38p8s","I would agree with you, but unfortunately it‚Äôs written after FF7 already exists. CC implies that her confident behavior in the original game is only present because of Zack, which is quite reductive of her character. It really makes it seem like they changed her just so they could fit an ‚Äúopposites attract‚Äù dynamic like Cloud/Aerith have. Nojima himself tried to ‚Äúattribute as much of Aerith‚Äôs traits to Zack‚Äù as he could.

They admitted to using a lot of Cloud/Aerith scenes (like the park, and the church) to both save time and callback to the original. A lot of players find these sorts of things to be uninspired, reductive, and just boring.",1704067343.0

"victoria3","t5_30k9i","Nah I had the same issue. If you fight for example Britain you can  have your navy deployed for 5 years without landing. That's because they send one small fleet at a time and each time your navy sits and waits for them even if they are months away because they sail all the way from India. In the meantime some navies you defeated earlier get repaired. 
They should implement a threshold where if your navy is significantly bigger than their defensive fleet, you get to land anyway. It's not realistic that 2-3 ships would be sufficient to stop hundreds of ships from landing. Each hostile ship should only be able to hold up a limited amount of the landing force.",1704067343.0

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","> Not sure if it's some deeper issue I need to work out within myself or what

It's probably a deeper issue. Reading between the lines what you're unconsciously doing is you're trading ""actual work"" for ""worrying about doing work"".

So unconsciously you're satisfied if you just worry about things and then you drop the need to do things, because you've already worried about it after all (you've given it the attention it deserves, so your sub consciousness is satisfied).

Brains are like that. They're a bit shit sometimes. This isn't really a ""you"" issue, other people deal with similar weird issues. This is assuming no other deeper underlying issues, but I assume you ruled those out after reading my advice.

One approach would be to reduce your tendency towards overthinking, then if you cut off that escape route and you keep cutting that off any time you start doing that, you should be able to force yourself more towards actually working on things.

(here overthinking and ""worrying"" is being equated, not 100% sure that's correct, but it is in many cases - that said, you can also find guides towards reduction of ""worrying"" on youtube and the like).

Just like how being left leaning a decade ago was generally a good thing and then it went from left wing to being ""extreme left wing"" almost immediately - like there's no more ""centrist-left"", you're either all into the maniacal left wing side or considered a traitor to the left values.

I see the same happening with the conservative side. Coming from a generally conservative family, for example, I see older relatives and family priests etc having conservative and steady values about how things should be, but they always make sense and there's always leeway. Then I see modern conservatives in my church and younger family who are neckdeep into thr conservative beliefs in unrealistic ways, interpreting the bible in ways it probably hasn't been interpreted in like a thousand years, having almost insanely puritanical beliefs that they can't quite function.

Sorry for speech again- more so trying to say it's hard to find modern conservatives that don't derail themselves into laughing stock, often veering into conspiracy theory territory. Even I sometimes laugh at how they end up interpreting things",1704067344.0

There's honestly no reason to be bothered by them. I personally leave them alone in my home since they take care of the little bugs that I can't always see - I am often left with a tiny collection of little corpses to vacuum up by their webs every once in a while, which is a win imo. If I find a large or vacant web, I'll swiffer it up and let them rebuild. Otherwise, I live and let live with them. My mother HATES them though since she associates them with filth, so I'll just scoop them up into my hands, or onto a cup or piece of paper and take them outside before my mom has a fit that I allowed a spider of any kind to spend the night in my old bedroom whilst visiting home. Tbh though, I don't allow any other spiders or bugs to stick around, and neither does my indoor kitty - they're either dead on sight or relocated outside if either of us can catch them. üòÇ

I also use a bug barrier spray roughly once a month outside of my windows and doors in the warmer months to help prevent bugs from getting inside of my poorly sealed apartment, but some will find a way inside anyway. As for the fruit flies, that's a whole different problem on its own. You're going to want to take your trash out more frequently, use drain/disposal cleaner at least once a week (disposal tablets are fairly inexpensive), clean your used dishes and sink afterward immediately after each use (including running the disposal after, assuming you have one), use a sealed bin for juice or soda cans/bottles that you toss, thoroughly rinse cans or jars out before tossing them, and sweep your busiest spaces daily to gather any loose food that may have dropped during the day that may be attracting them.

Did Chassim manage to secure her position as Duchess (I believe she was still facing opposition when we last saw her) and did she manage to secure Chalced's future as an independant state, without slavery and repression of women (it's mentioned that Chalced used to have much less sexist laws and practices in the past, so there would be a precedent)? Did she marry someone to secure an heir for herself, did she marry Seldon for political alliances between the rain wilds and Chalced (although Seldon's family does of course not really hold any real political power, Reyn and Malta are mere figureheads) and if so, that would probably mean that the next ruler of Chalced would be an elderling, I doubt they'd accept one of those as a ruler right?

Personally I think the next book might encompass some kind of conflict between the inhabitants of Kelsingra and those of the Duchies, regarding the Stone dragons, with stubborn elderlings like Rapskal claiming they belong to the elderlings, infuriating Kettricken and Bee (whose loved ones are some of those stone dragons after all).

"newworldgame","t5_3gmxe","You have a great misunderstanding. Im not saying chwats dont exist. Im saying people overexaggerate the amount of people that cheat. Literally the reason for the downfall in alot of fps. Take the cycle for example. Thousands of players who were actively playing. Some random streamers get clapped and then call cheats and cries cheats at every interaction. His following assumed they were cheating too and the game gets a bad rep for cheating. Later in the sub reddit, the same person acused of cheating post a vid of him killing the streamer in the most normal way and his ban gets reverted.

The game ended having one of the most rough starts in fps history because every other person thought people were cheating.

Assucations are only accusations. There is no real weight that someone is cheating simply because someone said so. Thats just poor judgement and pretty immature.",1704067345.0

See if you watch the movie **Reservoir Dogs** there is a scene that discusses this. It's mostly true. In that time period a waiter could be a single mother, a woman, and this is her only chance to make money to survive. The government promoted this because it really was better for women.  
Since that point women have had much improvement in their stance and now the wait staff promotes this belief because they gain all the benefit.

I think you‚Äôre not sounding judgmental at all. Her music can be healing to the broken or ostracized and thus, it does attract a certain fan base. I never knew the ‚Äúfandom‚Äù was as intense (over the last 30 years) as it is, until getting Reddit. To be Frank, I am glad I was shielded from it and just enjoyed her music on my own. The amount of cliques and pain people have been through is definitely something I don‚Äôt need in my life. It‚Äôs interesting to hear about, though. People love her, are defensive over her, and have a long time obsession. And that‚Äôs fine! That‚Äôs great! But we can still be cordial to each other.

"flightsim","t5_2qspy","Q400 driver here; In terms of the yoke I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs just not really that realistic for it to take up so much of my desk. Real yoke is much larger and force feedback is much stronger in the real airplane. No simulator I‚Äôve used emulates controls well enough to justify spending $500 or more.

At a point I just put away my alpha yoke because the Airbus joystick does the job while taking up less space. For me it‚Äôs all about reactionary behaviour. Ie. does the plane act similarly when I put the pitch to a certain angle at a certain speed? Does my controller respond to my inputs similarly to how it does the real plane? The PMDG 37 does this so well that I‚Äôve used it for practicing my landings. Similar sight picture to the Q even though the performance is different. Big difference being you never chop the power in the Q for landing. IMO it‚Äôs all about using your eyes (and ears, thank you Rad alt) to judge your rate of descent and reacting accordingly, while taking into account the aircraft‚Äôs energy state. 

Hot take but I‚Äôve stopped flying the Fenix A320 because it doesn‚Äôt flare correctly. At around Vref in the plane I fly a bit of pitching up will let the plane arrest the descent (some other Q pilots add power but that‚Äôs generally technique rather than law). On the Fenix it‚Äôs highly unresponsive at or near Vref that when I pitch up a bit it does nothing and you just slam into the ground. But who knows maybe I‚Äôm flying it wrong, I‚Äôm not an Airbus pilot lol but I thought it would be easier than how Fenix replicates it.",1704067349.0

"Retconned","t5_3fft0","Look... I had a coming unstuck in time/creating a time recursion moment a few months ago.

Call it bullshit, but to me, my senses, my mind... It completely happened.

All I can tell you is, if you can create one of these moments, you can see some stuff... And I think when you come thru it, by ever so slightly, maybe even only by a fraction of a degree, everything seems to lean in your favor ever so slightly more. Regardless of prior percentage.

Cool, call it crazy, no sweat.
Everything's been coming up Milhouse since.

I think the effect, is a bit like causality - intricately entangled.
When you create the effect, it sometimes overwrites other datum.
(your version of reality overlaps/creates a new intersection with reality at large)

Whether it is gigantic movements that erase/rewrite/overwrite - I'm uncertain. I think the affects of many multiple folks having their own play with the same ethers I stumbled upon - if it accrues like interest - could over time budge the adjustments into movements that we notice.

Suppose adjustments would be smaller, more incremental shifts. Fractions of degrees.
Then movements would be large portion of 1 degree - perhaps up to a few at a time.
A significant enough movement would make for an ME.
Or perhaps a build of Micro-adjustments add up to an ME, also. 

I'm no expert. Just a fool observing the universe at large and enjoying the ride while it's spinning and I'm here.",1704067349.0

I feel that, I used to run a LO that had quite a few USSEP dependencies but realized a lot of those mods are the more outdated ones. Definitely takes some time and tweaking to get it up and running so I totally understand that!

Realm of Lorkhan spawns you in like an alternate dimension type thing from what I understand and then from there you can customize a bunch of stuff, starting gear, role play options - from what I gather it‚Äôs very similar to Alt start in that regard just better contained as it exists outside the realm of Skyrim if that makes sense? I‚Äôve heard great things about it though! 

From what I understand about ordinator and associated mods is that they cause a lot of bloat unfortunately :/ I guess because they just add sooooo much.

"CivVI","t5_346b8","America is the only civ that gets a special unit after Modern Era.

But three civs that I think do a strong late-game war:

Australia's Diggers are situationally stronger on coast tiles outside friendly territory at 78+15, which is stronger than Mechanized Infantry. They're slower, but I think they're worth not upgrading on coast-heavy maps.

Germany's U-Boats are okay, but the production is insane. I feel I crank out twice as many units than warmongering civs all the way up through Emperor difficulty (with comparable empire sizes.)

Japan's ability to set up encampments in half-time is great on coast-heavy maps where you can control coastal movement, and the +5 combat on coast and shallow waters holds up well for ranged cross-support. Plus their special adjacency bonuses go hard if well-planned.",1704067350.0

Don‚Äôt rush it. If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned through all of this it is that I can trust my intuition. 

So if something is making you think it‚Äôs not the right time, then listen to that. There‚Äôs a reason you feel that way. 

Make sure when you do it you have time to answer their questions, and that you have time to recover afterwards. 

In the last month I‚Äôve come out to 3 very important people to me, and it went great each time, but I was emotionally exhausted afterwards. My therapist called it a ‚Äúvulnerability hangover‚Äù, and that‚Äôs an apt description. 

Remember that if anyone rejects you, that is THEIR choice, and does not have anything to do with you. 

Once you‚Äôve done it just spend a bit of time just doing self-care.

"interestingasfuck","t5_2qhsa","I really don‚Äôt understand this stuff. Presumably the zoo keepers are just exaggerating for tourists or to try and protect wild cassowaries by talking up how dangerous they are. I‚Äôm from Far North Queensland and have come across wild cassowaries on two occasions. They seem behaviourally very similar to emus. They were very skittish and wary of me, but checked me out to see if I would hand over any food. When I stood up, it just walked away. The second time, I threw a bit of mango near it. It ate the mango, checked me out to see if I‚Äôd give it any more, then left. 

They‚Äôre not very big and their beak and claws are blunt. I‚Äôve been bitten by emus before and it barely leaves a mark. It‚Äôs like being squeezed with plastic tongs. In contrast, I‚Äôve been around ostriches at a petting zoo that were probably close to 6ft tall and had very muscular legs - similar muscularity to a horse. (They were behind a fence and didn‚Äôt really want to be petted, but would eat out of your hand). I‚Äôd much rather face down an aggressive cassowary than an ill-tempered ostrich.

I made a working visit to the other team office across the coast back in February 2017. I absolutely absolutely loved it and wish I could go back. 

late in the fall, a series of events all happened one after another. I was let go from a job, my friends group was dramatically shrinking, and I adjust recently broken up with a girlfriend at the time, luckily my furlough. It was over and I was in talk with my temp agency to go back to the company I worked for. At the end of the break up something hit me ‚Äì as I was laying awake one morning early I happen to fiddle through my phone. Occasionally the summer I would look at apartments, and have that little bit of a yearn, and wonder if that would ever happen in my life. I did that, and it finally went off in my head: there is nothing here for me, holding me back, and if I were to try this, this may be the easiest in life I will get .

I had two job interviews that would have put me in two completely different large cities. If there were not paying off all of my student loans and having no debt whatsoever, this would not have happened. But I was able to negotiate a new contract higher and ended up moving 2300 miles across coasts. Today has been one of the best decisions to life I‚Äôve made.

The first thing I did after getting my apartment was making sure I had a six month emergency fund saved. Not only for furlough time just in case I was not able to get a full-time job but to give me a piece of mind that is very important to me.

make sure if you‚Äôre thinking to give extra planning and be very vigilant about your financials if you‚Äôre doing so alone. There‚Äôs a lot of pros and cons, so I hope the very best for you and your future, my brother. Ôøº",1704067353.0

The reason why people are annoyed is because it was clearly real though.

"The10thDentist","t5_233710","When I was younger I pretty good word for word recall of heard information.  If something was covered in the lecture at school I would remember it for the test.  Depending on the teacher I still had to read because there is more detail you can get by reading than is possible to speak out loud in a 50 minute class, but for the most part I never did any reading and I got decent grades.

Even now, while I can read a book just fine, if it's a complicated difficult book, I need to read it outlaid to myself in order for the material to penetrate.

Reading is better for some people, but the reason reading is prevalent is because the technology, culture and tradition of listening to recorded stuff is basically new.  

The fact that listening is relevant for learning is attested to the fact that formal education has been accomplished via lectures for centuries.  Verbal and text communication have their pros and cons, and it's true that reading and listening aren't the same, but to call reading better is definitely misguided imo.  And I feel like since there is no word for ""absorbing information from media"" and audiobooks are derived from books, it's not unreasonable to equate listening to an audiobook with reading.",1704067354.0

"MuslimCorner","t5_7hxp9q","Hindus are not considered monotheistic in Islam because Hinduism says that all of the different images of gods are different forms of 'one god'.

In Islam, the statement of faith (shahadah in arabic) is 'there is no God worthy of worship in truth except Allah'. So this means if Hindus believe that there is one God called brahman, this does not come under Islamic monotheism which states that there is only One God who is Allah.

Also the images that Hindus are known to produce of 'brahman' are not permitted at all in Islam and is considered ascribing partners to Allah, which can absolutely remove you from Islam.

What you‚Äôre talking about is an ant colony. Should we live like aunts? But even ants have classes, workers, fighters, queens, etc. 

Sure we can abandon money, but then we‚Äôre stuck with simple bartering if someone has something we want. Say you run a chicken farm, well you only have eggs to trade. If someone doesn‚Äôt like eggs, we‚Äôll you‚Äôll find it difficult to barter with them. Money solves this dilemma because it adds a universal method of trade, so you can purchase something without needing an object the seller desires, since the seller can use that money to buy their desired possession.

Some sort of currency is always needed. I build websites for a living, so if I were to build one for a ham shop, I‚Äôd likely have to accept payment in ham if there was no money. 

Even without money, some resource will be deemed as precious and be traded like money, gold, salt, etc. Eliminate money, and people will just use rare minerals as currency once again.

Quite frankly it sounds like you‚Äôve been drinking some sus kool aid with this strange portrayal of communism you keep pushing. It‚Äôs ridiculous, there‚Äôs a reason such a government hasn‚Äôt existed. There will always be some form of government. Someone will always be giving orders.

"HentaiAndRoleplayy","t5_3zthc3","Sam and her family lived in a bunker that her great-grandparents found after the great war. It was what they had called ""Vaults"". By the time they got there, it was long abandoned. They made a living here, growing cops in special planters that grew underground. What started off as just the two of them became entire generations lived it the vault. The food managed too keep up, always providing a surplus to the family. They rarely left the vault, with only the men ever going outside. Being isolated down there limited entertainment, so life took a more sexual form. Everyone ended up on some sexual adventures or other, everyone fucked or at least attempted fucking most of their family.  
  
By the time Sam was born, there were dozens of people living there. Her parents lived on the upper level of the vault, which would prove disasterous when the raiders finally found them. Sam was skilled in mechanics, and helped keep the vault running. Her daily outfit consisted of a jumpsuit, but she wore no underwear as was typical for her family. Sam was doing maintenance is the workshop when she heard gunshots from nearby. She grabbed her pistol and ran to help. The bandits attacked, they overpowered the small number of adults and killed her father. Sam managed to kill a few, but ran out of bullets so she ran. When she tried to get to the lower levels, she found that the others had sealed her up here.  
  
As the raiders got closer, she ran to the room of her family. Her mother was there, still alive. She made Sam hide in a vent, while she held off the raiders. As Sam hid, she watched in horror as her mother was overwhelmed. Helplessly she saw the raiders have their way with her, pounding away at her like dogs.  
  
Sam crawled through the vents and managed to escape the vault. The last memory of her mother was her moans of pleasure, being bred like never before...  
  
\>>>>>  
  
If you haven't guessed by now, I'll be playing as Sam. Sam is a young woman, having a history filled with perverted sex with her family, though never knowing anybody who she wasn't related to. Because she lived a closed life for all but those close to her, she's really unaware of things outside of their home. This story will start immediately following the attack and escape. I have never left the vault and have no idea what awaits me in the Wasteland. Message me with your kinks, limits and ideas if you are interested!  
  
My kinks are rough sex, abuse, spanking, torn clothes, stuck in wall, choking, free use, hitting, huge balls, anonymity, name calling, slut shaming, hatefucking, weird cocks, marking, bruising, scratching, biting, size, differences, gangbangs, flared cocks, beast, excessive cum, bulging, femboys, virgins and rape.

Math undergrad students can't do independent research. You can give them a very specific problem someone else already solved and they'll solve it. Tell them to do independent research on a topic or think original thoughts, and they'll freeze.

Additionally, math undergrads have this weird idea that doing a paper/presentation in the humanities consists of:

- Write down some incredibly weird and overly generalizing definitions, with no consideration as to whether or not these definitions reflect the actual meanings of the terms.

- Consider the logical complications of these definitions, if we assume they're 100% correct.

- Conclude that whatever logical complications you ended up with are correct without a doubt.",1704067357.0

"demonssouls","t5_2re9h","I like both old from and new from bosses for their respective strengths, but I do wish they would remember how unique their bosses used to be and live up to that, I feel like a healthy marriage is possible between the old unique strategy focused bosses and the new fast paced fights. 

I do worry that from soft is slowly forgetting what made their games memorable to begin with. I love elden ring very deeply, but things about it are worrying to me, there is no consequence for murdering merchants, respeccing is extremely easy, no more default solo invasions, more recycled content etc. I understand the argument for why these things work for elden ring. But what if they stick around in future games regardless of context? I've noticed that souls fans who started with elden ring are more likely to perceive intentional lack of accessibility as just bad design. Lack of fast travel is bad design, permanent negative consequences for my decisions are bad design, inability to instantly transform my build into a completed separate build is bad design. Sounds like a straw man but I've seen these arguments, I saw one guy complaining that he can't transfer weapon upgrade levels between weapons, in a game with already near infinite upgrade materials. You see most players complain about Micolash, complain about maneaters arena etc. I just hope fromsoft doesn't cater to these people and I hope some of these features in elden ring were tailor made for the games size and not because the company wants to move in that direction in general.",1704067358.0

I understand what you‚Äôre saying about feeling sympathy for him; although I‚Äôm not quite sure why you feel that way. I guess for me, it‚Äôs just a matter of trying to see that Willy was his uncle, his family. And that the whole process for him as a young kid was traumatic. The compensation thing is whatever to me; can‚Äôt really speak to that either. I guess I don‚Äôt see why that is something you seem to be hung up on. 

I have less sympathy for the jerk cop. I really don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs standard procedure to walk into someone‚Äôs home and trash the place. What is the point of that? It‚Äôs so dehumanizing and completely unnecessary. 

But I digress. lol

You have the right to ownership, I am defending your right. Why are you fighting me on this? Why don't you want to defend your right to ownership? Valve being private doesn't matter. You still have the right to ownership. Why does valve's 0.0000X% profit margin to hire a single codemonkey to maintain a library only vgui legacy client take precedent over your right to ownership? Valve has the right to be a private company but they don't have a right to take your private property.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","You need to have an actual conversation with your boyfriend (and any potential future partner) about this. Don't just say that you don't want kids, but ask them what they want. This is something you can't compromise on from either side. It's possible for some people to change their mind or not be really sure yet, but if one person says ""No I don't want them"" and the other says ""I do want them"", then you're not compatible. Even if they say, ""I do want them, but I'll be okay not having them as long as I can be with you"" because thats just the infatuation talking. 

From this post, I understand that you just told what you wanted, and he never protested, but you haven't had an actual conversation about it. 

There are many guys and girls who think their childfree partner will change their mind. But that's not how it works. So you have to be careful with who you date. 

If they don't say with almost certainty that they don't want kids, then don't start a relationship with them. It's always a gamble, but you can try to make your chances as high as possible. 

Also, we're not assholes for not wanting children. We're not bringing anyone into this world that we're not taking care of or anything. We just don't start having them, so there is nothing that we could be an asshole for. If he wanted them, he shouldn't have started dating you. And it's also always handy to have a 3rd room or 4th room. You don't absolutely NEED it, but it's always nice to have. 

For now, have a talk with your boyfriend and ask for what he wants. And if he can't say that he doesn't want children, then he is not the person for you.",1704067358.0

"LeavingNeverlandHBO","t5_xtf6x","MJ would have been eventually found out. Sadly, the public discovered Chandler in 93, but these inappropriate relationships date back to his ""Off the Wall"" days. MJ also paid off his maid for being inappropriate with her son around the same time. 

The grooming truly began with Emmanuel Lewis and when he resided with his family when he was burned during the Pepsi commercial. Emmanuel was seen on the ""Thriller"" set. Emmanuel mother limited contact when MJ tried to check into a hotel with him, claiming they were father and son. And this was when he was living with the family. 

 James Safechuck started touring with him after his Pepsi commercial, and  Wade Robson was next. 

MJ just got more bolder over time. But he stated in the interview with Diana S. with Lisa Marie sitting beside him that he wouldn't stop the sleepovers. Lisa Marie noted that she knew he had a ""thing for kids"" during that interview.",1704067359.0

If you want a good but less expensive option, I would go with the RYOBI 40-Volt HP Brushless 14 in; my camping buddies went cheap and bought these. It isn't as good as the Milwaukee, but holy cow, it's tough and powerful for the price. They've beat the heck out of it, and it runs great.

2. He doesn't have that much value as a hokage. Kawaki, Delta and the siblings are stronger than him. Shikamaru is smarter than him and is closer to Amado, Kawaki, and the siblings. He doesn't serve a purpose as hokage other than filling in Naruto's spot. Shikamaru overall is just better suited for that position.",1704067360.0

About a month ago I started going more modern/contemporary and international in scope. I read Murakami's *Colorless Tusuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage"" and Yukio Mishima's *Life for Sale."" I'm about to start Jose Saramago's *The Stone Raft,* and then it's definitely Marquez.

"consciousness","t5_2qktt","To be honest, I haven‚Äôt thought of that till just now. I really like the multiverse theory, so I‚Äôd assume that each universe contains its own timescape. An event on the timescape can cause a piece of it to split, creating its own separate universe with its own timescape, similar to tectonic plates colliding and causing landmasses to form new continents. We have a linear perspective of time when our receiver is tuned to the same frequency our vessel is vibrating at, aka a 3 dimensional frequency. Our brains are capable of operating at higher dimensional frequencies, so when our consciousness makes a dimensional shift, so does our perception of time. It goes from a linear two dimensional timeline to a topographical three dimensional timescape. This would explain how people could be capable of receiving prophecies. Traveling to the past in time is possible through things like past life regression hypnotherapy or accessing your memories. I‚Äôm still not sure about physical time travel yet. I haven‚Äôt had enough conversations with people more experienced with that in order to be able to understand it. The waves determine the physics of this reality, but the observer of the wave determines how the wave collapses. So for example, Jesus with turning water into wine. He was at a level of evolution in his consciousness that he was able to perceive himself outside of his physical vessel. Because he was able to perceive the water as himself, he was able to ‚Äúwill‚Äù it into wine, the same way that you‚Äôre able to ‚Äúwill‚Äù the secretion of dopamine in your brain. I‚Äôm not too versed in all the natural laws, so I wouldn‚Äôt properly be able to explain the specifics of what laws and principles were used, but that‚Äôs kinda the idea of it. However, because he was operating/observing in this collective 3rd dimensional reality, he would‚Äôve used the natural laws that govern this reality in order to do that. We can manipulate matter with our hands in order to cause a chemical reaction to turn one substance into another, so that would be the same thing but instead bypassing the need for physical movement through quantum entanglement, similarly to how we‚Äôre entangled to the physical vessel we perceive as ourselves. Dreaming is an entire subject of study in and of itself, and I‚Äôm not well versed enough in it yet to be able to have a solid enough understanding of it to where I could explain it to someone else. But I will say that I believe there are different dream realms that operate under different rules/laws that we‚Äôre able to interact with. If you want to know more about that stuff I‚Äôd recommend looking into Tibetan dream yoga. It‚Äôs an ancient yogic science solely dedicated to understanding dreams and using them as their tool for conscious evolution. I‚Äôm also interested in hearing where your theory differs. Hearing other perspectives always helps me to form my own",1704067362.0

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","If I‚Äôm benefitting me, I don‚Äôt care. My opponent can match my move and pull all of their players as well. The dynamics of the situation are vast.  In my instance, it was the most beneficial play to get the matchup I wanted. He could‚Äôve benched his team and we would‚Äôve tied, which may have changed the seedings points wise. He chose not to. I wanted the fourth seeding. He wanted to be the regular season top team. The two and three seeds chose to play their games out how it best benefited them as well. The top four teams were already determined. Just not the seeding. Circling back to the original point, my answer is still no, I don‚Äôt believe throwing a game is unethical if the team doing it is doing it for their own teams benefit, and not solely, or purposely, for another managers team. Collateral damage isn‚Äôt my concern. Intention does matter. Feelings do not. You may think it‚Äôs unfair. But the team who put themselves into a position to control their own destiny gets those privileges. Philly did it when they pulled Hurts, and prevented the Giants from making the playoffs a few seasons ago. It would‚Äôve cost them a better draft pick if they won. People bemoaned it, but tough shit.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you want a stable society you have to balance punishments for breaking the law with rehabilitation of people because these people have to come back into society.

If you make reentry into society too difficult or impossible then what you do is create an ever-growing number of disenfranchised individuals who have no reason not to continue to break the law.

Every victim is going to want a harsher punishment after they've been victimized.

But does satisfying the victims need for vengeance, because that's what it is it's not Justice it's vengeance, outweigh the negative impacts to the rest of society I say no.



>I have had a family member murdered and the main suspect (we know it was them but it's a complicated case for many reasons) is still free in society at the moment. I don't feel like it's fair they're free to live a happy life free of consequences

This is not a matter of whether or not they're being punished enough. They haven't even been convicted of a crime. 

Maybe they did maybe they didn't I don't know if they are convicted of murder then they will serve the statute for someone who's been convicted of murder if they're not found guilty of murder then they'll be released because that's how Justice is supposed to work.

It's not a perfect system but it's not made better by increasing punishments to make victims feel better especially if this person is found guilty when in fact they may not have committed that crime. 

If someone murders another person you're never going to get that person back you're never going to feel satisfied with whatever punishment that other person gets so we can't leave it to the victim to decide what punishments other people get we have to agree that is a society this is a reasonable punishment.

Once your goal is to maximize suffering you're no longer seeking Justice",1704067362.0

Xerphes, as he probably has the most expansive lore out of every OC I have. Used to live in a prosperous community, unfortunately a large war happened which drove the remaining scraps of his people back onto a large mountain with almost everyone he knows meeting their fate in said war, including the very king he swore to protect. Poor guy.

He also is perfect for any peaceful and/or tense RPs, as he has a strict kindness yet a honed sense for battle when needed. It makes him super flexible for nearly anything and it really bumps him up quite a few tiers.

Timing (when to step and swing the leg) along with not placing the hand too high, or standing too close to the pole are key elements to a successful Reverse grab on STATIC.

Here's a video that shows a few ways to do the Reverse grab https://www.instagram.com/reel/CpA-FYvOl4C/

For now, the progression I teach is you need to have worked on Shoulder conditioning wrist and hand strength, 3 times a week for 4 weeks or a few months for some people. In addition to that you should be able to pass the mobility test to insure your shoulder is ready for this trick. Last, you should also have a solid chair spin before working on reverse grab, it will make learning so much easier.

Spinning pole can be a bit less strenuous on the shoulders so for some this is a good option until you become strong enough for the static version.",1704067363.0

I usually read silently and whisper to myself specific lines. Rarely read the whole thing, rarely speak full volume even if I'm entirely alone. Jesus never gave us strict rules on how to pray alone (he gave us the Lord's prayer, but he never specified things like 'lay person can't pray the office'"". The BCP is a human invention after all, and while highly biblical, I think it is important to remember that it isn't *entirely* the Bible.

I think you can read a prayer, and that you can pray while reading. Those are different things. I could read a prayer from another religion and it doesn't mean I'm worshipping their god. But if I read a BCP prayer, I try to hold on to every word and send it to God myself. That's what makes it praying to me.",1704067363.0

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Many Noles weren‚Äôt in the game thread because they didn‚Äôt care about the game. They weren‚Äôt hiding. They are not hiding now. We just don‚Äôt care about that game, like at all. 

We were told a literal P5 championship game did not matter at all. Using the logic of the people who think the committee did the right thing, a bowl game did not matter if a title game did not matter. Half of our backups didn‚Äôt play. We had more guys play in our spring game. We took the check and bounced. 

You can be butthurt all you want about us not caring, that‚Äôs fine. Tennessee‚Äôs peak the last two decades has been the orange bowl, so I understand why you would be upset and confused that someone doesn‚Äôt care about it. I don‚Äôt mean that as an insult. To expect fans who have never sniffed the playoffs to understand being historically snubbed, is a big ask. If it happened to you all Tenn fans would light the world on fire. But it didn‚Äôt. Y‚Äôall were never close to consideration at any point, so you simply can‚Äôt understand it.",1704067365.0

"Berserk","t5_2rru6","Imo people focus on the aspects of rape in berserk while ignoring other horrible things that happen that happen in the story and well before the Golden age. The Black swordsman starts with Guts walking past a trailer of children that are being taking away to be eaten by the snake baron. The Court slaughters a room full of people after witnessing his wife in a satanic orgy. 

I‚Äôm not saying Rape is good thing, but with all the other dark and evil things shown in Berserk, it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that Rape is included in the narrative. 

The Eclipse is obviously a detailed and traumatic event where everyone besides Casca and Guts get torn to prices and eaten, so with Guts, Casca, and Griffth being main characters, it‚Äôs makes sense that Casca‚Äôs Rape is as detailed as it is.

Miura makes it clear from the first page that Berserk has a dark and detailed narrative, so it‚Äôs always kinda weird that people focus on the Rape but that‚Äôs just my opinion.",1704067365.0

I've never heard of this and it doesn't make sense to me at all. This puts couples who make roughly the same amounts at a clear disadvantage. A married couple with a 750k and a 50k respective salaries should have the same purchasing power as a 400k + 400k couple. What if OP had said his wife is a SAHM? Then suddenly his ratio is ok?

To me, unless a couple agrees on separate finances or unique circumstances like one job is significantly insecure compared to the other, their mortgage percentage (28% or whatever the appropriate number is) should be calculated against the combined HHI.",1704067365.0

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I do think people are allowed to have friends, but there always needs to be boundaries. If you can't trust your wife or husband to respect you with friends, I really think the relationship is over at that point. 

That all said, I likely would have divorced her the first time. Trust is never the same after someone does something like this. It will always hurt that you've been betrayed. 

If they decide to work it out, boundaries need to be set right away. It's not really something you wait 10 years to do. If you don't want her texting any men, that's something you make clear as a term to attempt to reconcile. It doesn't seem that was a term. And yeah, she could have decided that for herself. But it doesn't seem like she did. 

I think it's also worth noting that while you're trying to make an example, it's not entirely the same thing. Strip clubs are geared towards sexual arousal imo. A friendship really isn't. Again, I get it. But I would not choose to stay with someone I can't trust.",1704067366.0

We noticed it was worse when it was light out, and when there was any lights in the room. So we blacked out the room completely and it changed to perfect sleep 100% of the time. Even an LED from say a AC unit was enough for her to focus on and not sleep. So if your pulling your hair out trying everything, give blacking out the room a try! And good luck.",1704067366.0

US politics is fast to act towards major mass shootings that impact white people, and will use guns plastered all over the media to do it, but they will never go and address the root cause of most mass shootings... Which occur mostly in areas with low socioeconomic mobility, and low economic stability. update the minimum wage, push better schools and social supports and you're gonna end violence faster than banning any guns will.

Everyone should be paying a carbon tax for the carbon they put into the air. It's really pretty simple. 

>Why would the corporations funding these installations not be on the hook for any carbon tax incurred for building remote resources?

If they're reimbursing you for fuel costs, then they are (since any tax would be baked into fuel prices). 

If you're being reimbursed at the federal mileage rate, then that would of course be adjusted to account for any carbon taxes.

If you're not being reimbursed for travel at all, then that means you've decided you're being paid enough to foot the bill yourself. In that case, you would have to reevaluate whether it's still worth it in the face of higher fuel prices.",1704067366.0

I (not a lawyer) am not a proponent of divorce, but you should know that if you are married then any businesses he builds during the marriage are considered communal property. In the event of a divorce, you have the same rights to said community property as your spouse- particularly when you are sacrificing a career outside of the home to be a stay-at-home parent.
Depending on the laws of your state, in addition to the right to a fair and equitable share of marital property, child support, and potentially spousal support, a divorce attorney would, in theory, also be able to petition the court for additional assets as the non-working spouse.

None were more cruel nor thorough in their punishments than the Elysians, thus the Nikon were a scant and heavily battered people after their rebellions. Noted as a culture of savage corsairs and pirate lords by Elysian scholars, the Nikon were especially reviled by the people of Elder Elysios. Tall and olive skinned with dark eyes and black or bronze hair; the Nikon were a strong and hardy people who were considered strange and tainted by the men of starlight. Not much is known about the faith or religious practices of the Nikon other than the fact they worshiped Derridam, the Bull of the Brine. Derridam was thought to be a colossal sea beast, or deity alternatively, native to the Adoniuran Sea. A great bull with the latter half of a coiling leviathan, Derridam was said to have horns far larger than any ship and that the movements of the sea were caused by his grazing or ire. Warriors of the Nikon were said to wear rings and hooks in their noses and lips with helms decorated with horns and great fin-like crests to imitate Derridam. The Nikon often fought with weighted nets, three-pronged tridents, and single-edged curved swords or daggers styled like a bull‚Äôs horns. Using their heavy nets to ensnare their opponents, the Nikon were considered savage and dishonorable fighters. To spite the followers of the Sea Bull who had grown foolhardy and troublesome for the Empire, the Elysian astromancers created horrid amalgamations of men and cattle known as the ‚ÄúMinotaurs‚Äù, or the ‚ÄúDevourers‚Äù by the Nikon themselves. Vile and ravenous, the Minotaurs were designed to consume Nikon flesh much akin to cattle mindlessly grazing on grass. These horrible beings were released during several of the Nikon conflicts with unspeakable results. The remaining Nikon slaves used by the Astromancers were the last few stragglers of their culture. The Brazen Choker was seemingly a disease that afflicted predominantly Elysians and though it was found in other cultures, it started in the heart of the Elysian Empire as if it was specifically designed to kill Elysians. The Nikon were a hardy people in general and had a far greater immunity to most diseases than a majority of people.",1704067367.0

When we have AD Soldiers that have any amount going to their TSP the bonus will not finalize until we counsel the Soldier to ensure its what they want. Because it became such a problem with Soldiers setting their TSP contributions and forgetting that they did and had huge portions or all of their bonus going to TSP.

The Tax thing might be am error because when ever we confirm a contract with a bonus it asks if the Soldier is in a tax free zone. So maybe your Career Counselor made an error? But I have no experience with the Guard or Reserve. Never hurts to asks them though.",1704067367.0

Also yes, typically if someone is viewed as a ""religious nut"", then it would be completely reasonable to view them as stupid as well... IDK what your issue is here either...
Im not saying ALL religious people are stupid, but rather that the ideology itself is stupid--it goes against everything we know to be true, rational, valid, verified, decent, and realistic. Being that I believe that the belief system itself is stupid, I personally think that there is a non-zero number of believers who are also stupid people too. If we are being honest, its almost always the case that stupid people believe stupid things... its less likely that smart people would believe stupid things (though it does happen).",1704067369.0

Even if they weren't called ""palestinians"", their families and all the people they descended from are STILL the same people right; They just called themselves something different. For someone born in italy, there is a good chance their ancestor's were romans; the timeline for their family's history doesn't begin when they adopted their current label of ""Italian""

Also it does not matter if SOME israeli's actually come from Jews who never left. Those jews would not have a right to steal land either; they only have a right to continuing living there, just like the palestinians. MOST zoinists are not from that small subset of jews, and have been stealing land that belongs to other people

Zoinism itself only started in the late 1800's, and it was begun by Jews who wanted to have their own country. But since all the good land was occupied, they needed to invent a justification to steal land from someone else in order to create their country, even if it meant ignoring the tenants of their own religion. Using religion to justify a land claim, while ignoring it at the same time in order to take that land. Apply religion when its useful to what they want, and ignoring it when it contradicts them; they have much in common with the jihadists",1704067369.0

White fragility is definitely a thing and all these people bitching about ‚Äúbeing replaced‚Äù unfortunately distract from the actual issue, that‚Äôs easy to write off by anyone with a brain. The real problem is the quality of the narrative.

Swapping innit of itself, doesn‚Äôt bother me so long it‚Äôs done in a way where the finished product doesn‚Äôt suffer‚Ä¶ which unfortunately, seems to happen more often than not. Usually it‚Äôs done at the expense of the subtext of the IP. Audiences, even if they can‚Äôt articulate, typically pick up on it.

Also, the only thing that really grinds me politically is how many members of the media will selectively support or ignore projects that meet the undefined goals for increasing diversity, prioritizing only the ones that force shallow talking points via cringe-inducing dialogue. So even projects that go out of their way to create diverse casts, but don‚Äôt push that message in an excessively overt way get criticized or overlooked. 

Example; Annihilation was nearly an entirely female cast, based on an epic sci-fi novel, where the filmmaker took massive liberties with the source material to check all these ‚Äúrepresentation boxes‚Äù, only for the film to get ignored or panned by the same folks who would applaud a movie that‚Äôs just plain bad, but is rewarded because it does girlboss stuff‚Ä¶ like the Paul Fieg Ghostbusters reboot (which was fine but terribly boring and predictable).

"CoinBase","t5_2woql","Tax is very intricate, but long story short, no. Certainly not retroactively creating a business to generate bogus expenses and pretending your other income came through the business; that‚Äôs called tax fraud. You also owe self employment tax on income made from a business, and if you don‚Äôt want to run a mowing business to begin with, then you‚Äôre just spending 200k to avoid paying 60k in taxes.

The TCJA allows you to expense 80% of the cost of items purchased in 2023 as depreciation in 2023, but that just means that whenever you sell those assets in the future (even for salvage) you‚Äôll owe income taxes on the full sales amount. However, they also have to be what‚Äôs called ‚Äúplaced in service‚Äù, so if you never actually run this fake business, then the IRS will X all of it. 

Businesses pay taxes, no matter what form they are in. Individuals also pay taxes, no matter where the income comes from. When a business pays taxes to an individual, the business pays taxes and so does the individual. Whether or not there‚Äôs a potential tax advantage is something you‚Äôd need to discuss with a tax professional based on your specific circumstance, but there is no world where you make 200k tax free, unless the tax is simply deferred to later years.",1704067370.0

The best recommendations I've been able to use to help myself

Get a time lock safe. Because if you really break that mf open for a bag after spending 1-200 dollars on it you have a problem and need to stop doing the drug all together. And that 200 dollars will save you on thousands with a drug addiction. If you don't break it you end up learning patience and it gives you time to ask yourself what the next like will even help you accomplish other than just being up at 4am alone and high.

That makes your pot odds to call slightly worse, which makes it even more of a fold to Villain's turn jam, imo.

&#x200B;

> this player is not interested in pot control. Also, he doesn't perceive me to be aggressive enough to just spazz-bet a monotone flop heads-up. 

""Spazz bet"" vs ""bet an Ace"" which is heavy in your calling range are not the same things. 

""Not interested in pot control"" is new information, and frankly sounds a bit like you're trying to convince yourself of a narrative you have already decided on :) so I'm not going to reconstruct my logic based on that.

But, I will note that someone not interested in pot control would shovel in AK even though it's hard for you to call with worse... maybe the pot wasn't big enough for him yet so he went for the CR twice.

&#x200B;

I don't think HU changes much for how Villain's AA/AK plays, *particularly* AA which blocks so much of your calling range.   

I also think offsuit broadway bluffs (I'm assuming you mean KcQo and KcJo) are very optimistic -- first he had to put in a large 3bet them in MP vs (your words) **tight/passive UTG opener** and multiple players yet to act, and then he has to try to blast you off a range that's heavy in AX with not much behind.  

(KxKc that I gave him as bluffs in previous post both fits his preflop line better, and is a better bluff by more heavily blocking your AK as well as having an additional 2 outs vs hands like AQ.)

&#x200B;

> I could see checking the turn but, as mentioned, I'm betting for value and protection.

You are betting for value against hands with no ace and a big club.  I would say something like 3 combos of KKc and QQc, but you think there are more than that.

Betting for protection.... I guess, against random PP or baby clubs?

And you are also sometimes betting into a better hand.

&#x200B;

>  I could have also gone smaller IMO. 

Against an ABC player I'd agree, but against someone more aggressive a smaller bet may embolden more jams than calls, and you aren't in a great spot to call with your hand.

I really don't see the merit in betting.

There will also be those who hear Joy Division through tiktok for the first time and maybe get into post punk/goth/etc. through that. For those people it stops being ""that tiktok song"" as soon as they have a name for the band.

At least my local post punk scene could use some new faces. I'm 33 now and have been active in the scene where I'm from since 2008-ish. Going to gigs, being in couple of bands etc. People that attend shows aren't getting younger, I'm one of the younger people there.

TL:DR
If tiktok gets younger people interested in the musical style Joy Division pioneered, that's good. Maybe it inspires some to keep the culture alive even after the people from 1960's to 1990's get too old to play in bands or go to the toilet without help.",1704067371.0

When I think of some of the bigger personal beats of this year in the context of The Tower, I can definitely say they really shook things up for me personally-- whether through new insights, gaining clarity (for better or for worse), or literally shedding old foundations and moving towards better situations. Where some were more difficult to go through, others brought unexpected, last-minute opportunities that took me to new heights I hadn't imagined were possible for me.

As a few people have already said, my best advice is to just try to be flexible and expect the unexpected--and just roll with it to the best of your ability. The Tower can seem scary, but in my experiences through pulls (and now, with this year) I think it can signify enlightenment and a dramatic change for the better as well. I hope this helps, and I sincerely wish you such a bright and lovely 2024 - you've got this!",1704067372.0

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Hey! I might be in a really similar spot to you. I got diagnosed early 2022 by a psychologist. They can recommend meds here but not prescribe. So I started meds like 2 months later because it took me a while to get around to setting up an appointment with my GP. As usual.

Started on low 18mg concreta. That did nothing, took 4 months to get back. 27mg, that did nothing. Took 4 months to get back, 36mg, that did nothing. Took 4 months to get back. 54mg, that did nothing, took much longer to get back since I was pretty much in the gutter at this point. Started seeing my psychologist/therapist more regularly again, he finally got me to go in again. 72mg, that made me slightly fatigued for the first 3 days, then nothing.

My blood pressure hasn't changed. No random anxiety. No high. No effect on my thinking at all.

I'm currently have 2 refills on the 72mg left, and but I keep forgetting to take it so it's lasted a lot longer than it should've had.

At somepoint, I just need to get myself in again to ask about a different med type. It's hard to fight that feeling of disappointment, but people keep telling me different meds really are different.",1704067372.0

Like most things (such as sugar and antibiotics), ABA is amazing when used carefully and in moderation. For example, it was incredible at stopping by sister from self-harming during meltdowns when nothing else worked. It can also work miracles at teaching self-help skills and language skills to previously non-verbal skills.

The problem is when it goes to far and makes wild promises that it will cure autism. As a teacher I once had a student with low needs autism had a ABA therapist the parents insisted on following them around and were literally tracking how many bites of food they were eating per minute during snack and stopping him from stimming behaviors that would have been considered age appropriate even if the child was neurotypical. 

Antibiotics is my best metaphor for it. There are times when it is very needed and should be given by skilled professionals. But giving it out to all in mass doses and promising to cure all disease will cause all kinds of serious harm.",1704067373.0

This is Rex, an animalistic bio-engineered weapon. He was originally created as a hybrid between multiple animals and an alien monster, but was able to break out of captivity after being trained to become a living weapon. After escaping, he destroyed the facility in which he was created and killed every scientist inside, eventually running off into the mysterious land known as the Blackwoods.  Rex has generally superhuman abilities (incredibly strong, durable, and fast), and can channel energy from the cords on his back to control electricity (such as shooting balls of electrical energy and electrifying his hands for an extra ‚Äúkick‚Äù in his‚Ä¶ kicks). He‚Äôs naturally inquisitive, but also likes to fight, and can show a sadistic streak when he‚Äôs winning.

For his Up, Rex would electrify his hands and swipe an uppercut with his claws simultaneously. For his Side, Rex would lunge and bite at his opponent. For his Down, Rex would pound on the ground and swipe around with his tongue. For his Neutral, Rex would simply swipe his claws in a combo.

For Rex‚Äôs Final Smash, he would first stun his opponent with an electrical blast from his hands. Then, he would tackle them and start viciously clawing at them. Finally, he would wrap his tongue around them and start flinging them everywhere.",1704067373.0

I had a 1990 Max that I loved so much that when my wife wanted a new car I talked her into leasing the exact same model a few years newer, on the premise that when her lease was ending I would buy it and sell mine.

I‚Äôm spite of my efforts to duplicate mine, her‚Äôs never felt the same. The power seats ‚Äúsat‚Äù differently, the engine which was exactly the same wasn‚Äôt (subtlety changed torque curve and maybe other engine management issues). I didn‚Äôt buy it and happily drove my 1990 more than 450,000 miles. When I traded it in the original battery had begun to fail!

Today (New Year‚Äôs Eve 23/24) I leased a replacement for my 2021 Honda Civic Sport, a car I have loved since the day I leased it in June 2021. It‚Äôs been a joy to drive, 40+mpg, 137mph top speed and slightly diluted R-Type looks and trim. A poor man‚Äôs R-Type (about $20g‚Äôs cheaper) and a perfect antidote for a late life crisis (I‚Äôm 80+).

Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to return it‚Äôs $30,000+ replacement. It‚Äôs the same model, a little more dressed up but same engine, drive line and specs. It drives very nicely, but it‚Äôs truly a loaf of white bread! I sincerely hope that since I‚Äôve had it less than 24 hours they‚Äôll take back and give my old one again!

I‚Äôm a pretty moderate driver, probably 85% of the time I‚Äôm cruising an interstate on cruise control. But I‚Äôm not ready for the senior citizen variety of car. In my opinion cars and sailboats are like girl friends‚Äîwhen you have one you love, come up with the time and money it may take to keep it. You won‚Äôt be sorry!",1704067374.0

"Ultrakill","t5_2etapp","I don't think I fully agree on that advanced mobility aspect. The Leviathan felt like a rather easy boss to outmaneuver, even without leaving the platform. I don't even know how to rocket ride, and the only attack I do is projectile boosting and the occasional railgun for like 99% of the non-immune enemies so I wouldn't exactly chalk it up to me being skilled at the game or anything beyond basic FPS experience.

The Leviathan has such easy attacks to avoid that are very telegraphed. You have the bullets where all you do is move left and right, dashing through the bullets where you change directions. You have the one where it lunges at you, where you just dash a bunch after it makes the parry noise. And finally, you have the tail swipe, which is pretty easy to tell if it goes above or below you, so either just need to jump/grapple or do literally nothing.

It does combine the tail and front attacks after a bit, but i would just focus on the tail until an audio cue would clue me in on if/when to dash.

Personally, the fight felt like it had such an open area, but I never really had to use any of it beyond the wooden platform besides just looking cool (which yes style and all but as a casual player I didn't really care).",1704067374.0

The important part is probably its rugged terrain that only Paldeans can reliably cross, but invaders will be using bombers and planes and drones - not their two feet. Its lack of emphasis on training means that Pokemon will have much less of a role than they would anywhere else. In fact, their focus on well-rounded people (given the biggest school's curriculum) might mean that Paldeans would use more conventional weaponry, which is a blessing and a curse. It could target Pokemon-specific traits to take them out, like cancelling their evolution or draining their life energy, but I'm not certain about durability.

"Isekai","t5_3hwoy","1. If omnipotent being isn't a being that divided itself first but is the collective of all omnipotent beings then it is certain that through the infinite beings at least one would desire the destruction of the universe. But that's my point. It wouldn't reach the omnipotent being. It is also not certain that your desires and perspective would reach it either.
2. 

> The point is that you keep intentions that wish for an action to be done until the action is done.

It still doesn't mean that only selfless desires would survive. If the intentions before omnipotence matter then it would count for both selfish and selfless. You don't gain anything or lose anything from any of this actions. You don't do it for personal gain anymore. You do it just because you wanted to do it before becoming omnipotent.

I don't say they act by committee. I am saying that they act based on the merged personalities and desires of all parts. They act like a fusion of all those beings. I know that if a goal would be just a mean to an end then you would jut jump to the end. In my example I used the goal of becoming a celebrity as an end, not a mean. Becoming a celebrity is in itself a selfish goal. It is the ultimate goal in my example. And you would do it in that case, even if it is a selfish goal.

Again, it doesn't apply only to selfless goals. If you want to do something selfish then other people would be affected as well. You don't really care for their benefit so the only reason you would choose to do anything is if it affects other beings beside yourself. So you would do some selfish actions as well. If you have a goal you would do it. You are living for that goal itself. It wouldn't matter that it was already satisfied through omniscience. You would still do it just because it is your goal.",1704067376.0

They just see that their team has taken 35 3s and only made 8 so they must be ""chucking threes"". Their answer to that is ""JuSt DrIvE tHe BaLl"" Like, that's what teams used to do before Curry came along and games would end like 87-79 *because it's really fucking hard to score in the paint in the NBA*. Sometimes the ball just doesn't go in, shit happens.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"TheCrownNetflix","t5_3akoe","I mean, yeah for as racist as America is.

When they‚Äôre marriage was announced, it was white powder sent to them by someone in the UK.

It was the BBC making cartoons depicting her as knife wielding American & darkening her skin for extra points.

It was papers in the UK making a big deal about her not having enough white women on the cover, thus painting her even more as a target for racist white supremacist.

It was a reporter in the UK that liked their son to a monkey.

It was a uk reporter that said their daughter should be named Gerogina Floydia or whatever.

It was UK podcasters that said Archie was an abomination that should be put down. 

It‚Äôs the UK that linked Meghans first project to terrorism.

It‚Äôs the UK papers (tabloids but they‚Äôre tabloids aren‚Äôt treated as such in the UK) that linked her to terrorist because of avocados. (And when it was William, they were just a fun snack for Kate) 


And the list could go on. It‚Äôs the UK in the head of counter terrorism that said they had seen extreme and creditable threats against them that had been prosecuted. It‚Äôs the UKs MET police that has officers sharing racist memes and etc about Meghan.

So yes, they‚Äôre much safer in the America, than in the UK. Added with the fact that they‚Äôre not bullied into a working relationship with outwardly racist tabloids like the other royals who don‚Äôt seem to mind associating with that. They wanted backing and protection, and if they couldn‚Äôt have that, then at least don‚Äôt force them to associate with papers that out-right harassing them. 

So, instead of going what with what you think and assume to be authority of. Harry and Meghan wanted (quite stupidly I think) to continue to work for that institution. They just wanted to be non-taxpayer funded so the ‚Äòwe pay for them!‚Äô Excuse wouldn‚Äôt be used against them. They also didn‚Äôt want to work with the royal Rota.

"BPDlovedones","t5_33dd6","Mine was supposed to take a trainee under his wings at work. As it is with trainees there are there to learn. My pwBPD had zero patience with that young shy guy and every evening he went on a rant about him, that he cannot work with a mentally retarded. That his father would have better wanked into a hanky, or come into the mouth of his mother instead of creating such a worthless piece of meat.
This just went worse and worse, over several weeks and I turned more and more concerned how he‚Äôs treating his young trainee.
Once I visited him at work, and in front of others he acted like he was a fatherly friend and mentor to this boy. He actually never acted his hate and anger out, but every evening, at home, he expressed nothing but disrespect and sheer disgust about his trainee.
I believe in reality they got along fine, but in his mind he someone had chosen that boy as the main cause of all the shit that went on in himself.
He used degrading and dehumanizing an 18 year old kid as a catalyst for feeling like shit in his own skin.
In fact, I think he projected himself and his self hate and all his own failure onto this young guy who‚Äôs never done something wrong.",1704067378.0

It is fine to keep gaining weight if that's what your body naturally wants to do, eat healthy and don't over do it if you can but don't try to limit food just so you don't gain. 

I'm pretty sure I was gaining like 2-3lbs a week near the end of my pregnancy. I felt SO HUNGRY all the time. OB monitored my weight and didn't say anything about it, had healthy baby, lost all my weight gain (with diet and excercise) 2yrs pp.",1704067378.0

"nasalsnuff","t5_2uip2","> Are the paper Mache ones extremely fragile? I saw a few but wasn‚Äôt sure.

If it is an authentic piece, then it should be quite solid (they were usually lacquered or otherwise given a hard shell coating and feel like they are made of a light wood). Obviously, less sturdy than silver or a hardwood box, but they were made to do the job and are a classic snuff box material from those days when people bought them to use as a practical everyday item.

Note: it's probably obvious, but do not expect any antique snuffbox to be airtight or even have a particularly good seal. In my experience, best  for refilling with fresh snuff for the day (or two or three) and that's about it. The oblong St. Claude ones with the hinged lids are something of a exception however (as long as the tenon ledges of the lid still fit with good friction against the mortise edges of the box such that it takes a bit of effort to pop it open). You can still get modern reproductions of those, actually: e.g. https://mysmokingshop.co.uk/snuff-accessories/snuff-boxes/authentic-st-claude-france-hinge-lid-wood-snuff-box-snb110).

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I've often seen theists state God allows evil because free will.

So there's a spectrum between free will and not free will. For example, God could appear to Joe Murderer as a burning bush, telling Joe not to kill the person. Or a random passerby with jujitsu skills stops Joe. Or the victim had the forethought to carry a gun, or not go out, or go out with an navy seal, or the murderer's car wouldn't start. So there's a whole range of actions God could take without turning Joe Murderer into a finger puppet.

I mean, think about it. A world where all kinds of weird coincidences occur that keep people from killing each other. 

Bigger picture - what if any of the assasination attempts against Hitler had been successful? Or he became a moderately successful artist? How about Stalin getting a visit from an angel while he was in seminary and became a priest?

"predental","t5_2ucup","With respect it seems like it‚Äôs just easier to offer to someone the committee votes for rather than to do all these calculations.

I think it‚Äôs easy to forget, admissions isn‚Äôt like one person. Usually there are like 12 faculty in the committee and one chair. There will also be admissions staff and an administrative faculty in charge of the whole thing, who in many places doesn‚Äôt get a vote on the actual committee.

So the offers don‚Äôt just come from one person, but rather 12. So in the room if someone was like I love this Harvard one let‚Äôs offer them, we have to have them, and they advocate enough, they will get them voted in. If they don‚Äôt get enough votes because someone is like eh he was super lukewarm about us and doesn‚Äôt want to come here who cares let‚Äôs take this other one I like, then the compromise might be a waitlist.

It‚Äôs usually about advocacy in the committee and not about like what we think a candidate will do. Also it‚Äôs not that labor intensive for first round; if they say no we will have second round offers out soon. Honestly if you were making a huge argument that this person will never come here, I‚Äôd say uh ok offer them and one extra, I like this one. So let‚Äôs invite 151 instead of 150 first round.

An odd truth: the last 10 seats usually take like 30% of the total effort to select, as it is later in the game and you do get candidates pulling out after depositing to take other places, which to a point is totally fine.",1704067378.0

Goku always encourages gohan to study and even feels bad when gohan has to fight and in super he's literally with his family all the time with there's peace.if that's not care then I don't know what is",1704067378.0
"wine","t5_2qhs8","‚ÄúJust by looking?‚Äù  No, that would be like consulting a psychic.

As has already been said, it‚Äôs a matter of experience.  Vega Sicilia Unico and R. Lopez de Heredia Vi√±a Todonia Reserva are two of Spain‚Äôs longest-lived wines.  They can and do (as long as one can resist opening them) age for decades and decades.  It is not unusual for either one of these wines to age 50 years or more under proper storage conditions.  But they are now 11 and 13 years old respectively, and for these two specific wines, they are still quite young.

In my case, I have tasted the 2010 Todonia not too long ago, and it is very young.  (I have more in my cellar.)  Hell, the 2001 vintage is still quite youthful.  The Unico is also in my cellar, but I have not tried it.  Experience with previous vintages tells me to keep my hands off this one for quite some time...",1704067379.0
"Earwolf","t5_2se24","I think we‚Äôre in a transition era, but things are as funny as ever in my opinion. Earwolf‚Äôs hayday as a comedy network may be done, but there‚Äôs so many incredible shows on Headgum, and Headgum/Dropout seems to be the new hub for comedic/improv voices. There‚Äôs earwolf favs on in that world and new voices that have emerged as well. There‚Äôs also a lot more diversity in the performers than there were in the early days. Also, Comedy Bang! Bang! (which I consider to be the face of the early Earwolf era) is as strong or stronger than it ever was, and there‚Äôs incredible content on CBB World. I still have a fondness for the 2013-2016 era of CBB, Improv4Humans, Who Charted, HDTGM, POD F. Tompcast, and early HH, but things have evolved and progressed in really exciting ways.",1704067379.0

I am confused by the fact that u have invited people that u don't even know, of course they will not be motivated to continue mining if a total stranger sent an invite to them and perhaps they don't even know what pi network is

It would be ur responsibility to know how to contact the people in ur mining circle, after all u invited them in to mine together with u",1704067380.0

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","It is a lot harder to find PvM/Skilling stuff with longevity than PvP. Like in DMM, the goal isn't just getting gear or leveling skills, but PvPing with those gears/skills where they are risked. So even if they give exp multipliers or buffed drop rates, it just makes it easier to get to and back into that PvP.

With Leagues, the focus is much more on getting those levels and drops, so it is hard to think of any league concept that wouldn't die off kinda quickly. Like if it is area locked like Twisted or Trailblazer, you can reach the limits of your areas kinda fast; some hit it within a month of TBLR so I don't see that format working well for a permanent league, especially if you couldn't ""redo"" your regions.

Something like Shattered Relics works better, but even in the League a lot of players felt the skill and boss unlocks where too quick, so it just ended up being a faster paced Ironman (more exp and higher drop rates) with relics. I'm sure that would appeal to some players, but it really feels like it would get old quick. Like how many players would want to more quickly get to all the endgame on more isolated and less popular worlds when they could do it on the main game? Even if a new boss like say Muspah drops, you'd finish it 5x quicker (e.g. 100 kills instead of 500) with much quicker kill times, so what might be 25~ hours of new content to grind in the main game would just turn into 5~ hours in a permanent League world.

Perhaps there is a future league concept that would be better suited for a permanent world, but no matter how they do it I think there would be an issue of players getting to the endgame too quickly and getting bored since they probably wouldn't be as invested in post-game content like clogs or pets on League Worlds and new content wouldn't last as long either. Even for something like a new skill it may take 200 hours to max on the main game but only like 13~ hours for an already maxed league account, so it seems really hard to keep players invested in leagues worlds since no rate of updates would even be enough to match the exp/drop rates. It would be fun for practicing differnet content though or such, but better Tourny Worlds or the like could also achieve that.",1704067382.0

I honestly think that's a solid point. I worked ER admissions for almost a year before moving to tech and axing my dream of becoming a nurse, but my main issue was admin being the devil incarnate. I could deal with being screamed at, seeing people die, getting TB coughed in my face, etc. But I couldn't deal with admin making us do volunteer work for the hospital fundraiser events to get a bonus, then flipping out when you repeatedly decline, using maintenance as their personal roadside assistance because they can't be arsed to get gas, and cater a meal from one of the most expensive restaurants in the area for the entire staff just to tell us they're cutting 401k matching because we aren't bringing in enough money üôÑ

I knew I wasn't going to make a ton of money in comparison to the work I was doing, but I really wanted to be able to help people. Unfortunately, working at a hospital tanked my desire to help because I knew I couldn't deal with the power plays going on 24/7.

Internet speed isn't tied to ideas of what it should be or pushed forward by what it needs to be. Moores Law doesn't apply. In most states it is unregulated or treated with the same contempt as cable television in the courts. It is seen as unnecessary. Unneeded. When in reality it is the backbone of our age and the singular network that moves all of our data, our wealth and our people to new and better things. The politicians of the last few decades have ignored it or cut fat checks to monopolies that should rightfully have been dissolved and cleared out of the way for progress.

According to the FCC broadband map almost all commercial installations, factories and plants only have access to two internet service providers. This never represents two competing companies but usually two networks owned by the same company with different pricing and the same basic technology from decades ago. Internet speed is not dictated by demand but by the bare minimum needed to profit. Outside of major cities people are still on DSL connections or using providers with severe latency issues.

Every time you pay your internet company that annoying bill that goes anywhere from twenty dollars to a hundred the cash you fork over isn't re-invested into new infrastructure and necessary maintenance. That money you pay them is turned into pure profit for shareholders and used to strengthen their incumbent position. 

The existing ISP monopolies are not frantically racing to roll out fiber cables and 5G technology. They don't provide Wi-Fi 7 routers or wire homes with the new CAT7 cables. Mostly they do almost nothing at all and hide their incompetence with flashy marketing and deceptive sales tactics. The only reason they get away with it is because the older demographics in countries like the USA and even some european countries like Germany don't see the internet as infrastructure but rather as a loathsome source of entertainment and moral decay.  

I'm not excited for telerobotics because I know it is impossible. It is difficult enough accessing cheap videogames and buffering meme videos. Why would it be safe to use advanced technology that requires a high degree of control?",1704067383.0

"gatekeeping","t5_3fkyp",">Can you name any specific changes made to an anime, or the anime industry, that directly came as a result of new people taking interest in the medium?

Yes. The globalization/westernization/heavy influence over westerners trying to appeal to a new audience, such as Netflix's adaption of Cowboy Bebop and Deathnote is an example of the direct result of new/outsiders fandom trying to make waves/changes outside of what fans want/the in-group. They tried to cater to every audience they could think of outside of those that were fans of the source material and were chalk full of American influences and other things outside of what made those original shows good, which they outright ignored. This has put pressure on the art form to cater to western sensibilities, sometimes that are just censorship, but are also character changes. 

I've also heard of fans supposedly giving death threats to My Hero Academia's creator because they wouldn't ship certain gay characters, and this would easily have been from an outside western influence, but I'll keep this to that of a rumor.

There's also the group of Japanese fetishizers that over emphasize the need for fan service to the point that creators have to lean into lolicon, body pillows, and other type of products that serve to only get people off vs anime as a pure story telling art form, which it originally attempted to be. 

The coomsumer demands for quick and constant content delivery, driven by international streaming services, put immense pressure on studios. Tight production schedules compromise the quality of animation, resulting in rushed or poorly executed episodes. There's essentially more trash quality wise than ever before.

(I deal with both for work) UPC is going to be more ubiquitous for patch cables, parts, etc... You may want one APC at least to extend your fiber nid indoors if desired.

When PON systems use APC, they are dealing with a fiber signal that's gone a few miles, then split to 1/32 or maybe 1/128 it's original strength, and the reflections could be potentially meaningful at that point. APC started in cable systems, where they send a radio signal (converted to light) down the fiber. Gotta have a nice SNR to keep the modulations happy.

FYI: I had an old, very narrow '20s house. No rooms up or down to separate and shield/insulate you from outside noise anywhere. Had 2 neighbors on either side of my 50' lot, and my tiny (old schoolhouse virtualy) home. Consistent noise, 9am - 9:30pm, 24/7! 
I eventually erected 2x4s against the existing plaster walls, but left an 1"" buffer space to allow airflow. It was on the sunside of the house too. So I had to buy aluminum blinds - to keep them intact with that heat in the summertime in the windows. I used soundproofing insulation in between the studs, then put drywall up. And yes, I definitely covered those old thinass windows.

It stiffled a lot of the noise, but unfortunately not all. But so much better compared to the before scenario of hollow plaster walls and single pane windows. Before I sold the house. I took all the sound-reduction wall I erected down and sold what I could. People actually bought the soundproofing insulation and I was surprised for sure! 

The best part, after I spent $20k of updating the home, I made $40k profit cuz I sold it before the market flipped from sellers market -  before 2022. Sigh of relief I'm through with that nightmare",1704067384.0

"Dreams","t5_2qmbx","Okay so take this with a grain of salt because i‚Äôm not an interpreter or anything, but typically the moon represents intuition. In context of the rest of your dream i‚Äôm gonna say it might be signaling to something where you feel trapped/unsafe either happening in your life or is about to happen, most likely about to happen because you probably wouldn‚Äôt need intuition to see that something bad was already happening. There‚Äôs a lot of details in your dream that could point to your family being involved, i‚Äôm not sure( not that there putting you in an unsafe situation but possibly will be put in one with you ) you also wrote that in the dream you where around a lot of water, which typically represents life, or the unified field. I‚Äôm gonna guess that because the girl mentioned being kidnapped while you were walking by the water, that your dream was talking about life. I think the girl also represents your intuition. In my opinion this means that she was an extension of you, talking about how something pretty dangerous or life threatening could be happening to you soon.

Then, you'll see a chat button in the bottom right of the browser, click that, talk to a sales representative, let them know you're in the medical field and they should knock off another 5%, that should take you to about $900.

It's also not prohibited to meet your agent for the first time in todays world where Zillow and most other sites just sell every buyer inquiry to the highest agent bidder. 

You absolutely can request your agent to personally confirm the showings after speaking with buyer agent - at that time if they can determine it's a bona fide buyer you should let the showing happen.  I know showings can be cumbersome to a seller ... but also consider a buyer that YOU may determine to be new, or not qualified may just see and fall in love with your home and be the best buyer.",1704067387.0

"starbucks","t5_2qwza","Honestly if we were to mod a frapp to be like that, it‚Äôs really not worth the money. Here‚Äôs why: essentially a Frappuccino at its core is milk (typically whole but it can be changed to whatever), coffee (if applicable), ice, and the frapp base, and flavor (again if applicable). The base itself is sugary, however it makes the frapp creamy and smooth instead of an coffee milky slushy. 

Personally I‚Äôve made a frap with just coffee (I can‚Äôt remember if it was frapp roast or espresso), nonfat milk, and ice but to get it to an okay consistency you can‚Äôt follow the Starbucks standard recipe for it (meaning each barista would essentially make it different and even the same barista could make it differently each time it‚Äôs ordered)

Now I know you said no tea, however the passion tango (herbal blend no actual tea) I feel like could be pretty good blended as a slush w a couple Splenda (or whatever sweetener you use) I would specify no frapp base still tho

Otherwise you could do like an iced sugar free vanilla latte w whatever milk you‚Äôre comfortable with

He's saying that as POTUS to the SOT of Georgia and of his own party. He has immense sway and influence over him. To which even his own party - who should have a vested interest in his election - said he was out of bounds with such a request. 

It's like when your boss says ""Can you go take care of X for me?"", he's not asking you if you are physically capable or hypothetically able to do the task, he's telling you to go do it.

Do I remember in past campaigns when gaining a subclass was a neat packaged in a single mission? No I don‚Äôt, and you don‚Äôt either because thats not Beyond Light. You forgot that you had to commune with those crux splinters so many times in the ‚Äònew subclass test drive‚Äô missions i talked about, and you only unlocked stasis at the end ( just like LIGHTFALL??? woah.) and even then, you only had the bare minimum. The rest had to be unlocked through a post-campaign quest that only recently received a rework as to how you got those customizations of aspects and fragments ( it was even worse before then, imagine that? ). As opposed to Lightfall‚Äôs dealio with Strand, where you did the same exact thing but at the end of campaign, the world is your oyster and you are free to unlock whatever you want as long as you had enough Strand Meditations.

Everyone agrees that Lightfall‚Äôs story was horrifically lacking, but the point is you trying to put Beyond Light on some sort of pedestal when LF is just Beyond Light: Sour Apple Flavor with better missions.

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","Yes! I‚Äôm sure there are other examples, but I lived for a few years in West Africa and in the country I lived in there were extremely rural areas where a lot of the land wasn‚Äôt owned by anyone. It was miles and miles between rural villages that each had a few hundred to a couple thousand residents at most (also, 50% of pop was children, so there weren‚Äôt hundreds of different households.)

Homes: It was super easy to just go build a house on whatever free space there was. You didn‚Äôt have to buy property. If more people needed homes, they just build more homes.

Farmland: Pretty much everyone in this area worked as subsistence farmers. I know of one specific village where nobody owned the farmland. Every year when it was time to begin planting each family would go out to the outskirts of the village and stake however much land they wanted to. You could claim as much farmland as you could farm. It wasn‚Äôt a total free for all though. They were social hierarchies in play that determined who got the best land.

There‚Äôs a saying in African studies that wealth in Africa is measured by people, not land. There is so much land. That is one of the many reasons they were long-standing, deep, cultural roots to having large families. It‚Äôs not just about farm labor or a lack of family planning, it‚Äôs about social status and wealth. The more people you have under your purview, whether it be your own children or extended family members that you are the patriarch of, how many people you have ‚Äúunder‚Äù you determines how much power you have far more so than just money or land. 

Obviously, this is the only true extremely rural areas. Urban areas and more densely populated areas have regulated land ownership.",1704067388.0

If the Bengals lose than the ONLY way the Bills drop out of the playoffs completely is if the following scenario happens;

- Bills Lose to Dolphin + Texans or Colts win *(inevitable)* + Steelers win

Basically, if the Steelers lose next week, the outcome of the Bills game vs the Dolphins is irrelevant to their playoff chances. Whereas if the Bills win the outcome of the Steelers game is irrelevant to the Bills playoff chances.
