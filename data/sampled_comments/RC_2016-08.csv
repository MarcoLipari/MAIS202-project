That doesn't really mean much when the Democrats lack the political will to do what they say needs to be done. Again, they offer lip service and nothing more.

&gt;As for what the democrats have done, here is the main one. https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act

What have they done this millennium? What did they do when they had Congress and the White House? You may as well say the GOP is awesome on environmental issues because they created the EPA.

&gt;And there would be much more if any plans to prevent catastrophic damage to the planet went unmolested by Republicans.

Which plans did have the Democrats made during the Obama years and how have they been molested?

&gt;Not only have the Democrats done a lot for the Climate, but the only reason they haven't done more is that they are blocked every step of the way by climate change deniers. 

Then I'm sure you'll have many recent examples of gas tax hikes and carbon taxes the Democrats tried to pass. Care to share them?

&gt;There is no way you have not heard of any of the programs and legislation used to slow down or stop damage to the environment. 

You can't seem to name any recent ones.

Hopefully this'll be a wake up call for him that a woman's sexual choices don't determine whether they're a good person or not, but it's possible he'll just put this down as a mistake you need to apologise to him for.

I'd tell him how out of line he was with his response and keep this relationship frozen on your side too until he apologises to you properly (none of this ""I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings but I was just so mad"" bullshit).

"DnDBehindTheScreen","t5_36c1q","Warcraft has an elegant solution to this, with the Peon unit. Essentially, the only orcs (in the first 2 games, things change with 3 and beyond obviously) that matter are the warriors. There are peons that handle things, but they are chattel slaves at best. There's a bit in one of the books about the formation of the horde of the beginnings of orc society stratifying, with the first peons being mentioned.

There's also the fan theory or LoTR. Volcanic soil is among the most fertile in the world. Where can you find a nice big, continuously active volcano? Mordor. The dreary bits you see behind the black gate are just the barracks and formation areas for Saurons army. The rest of Mordor, which is quite extensive if you look at the maps, is pretty much dedicated to agriculture and production to support the armies. After all, the Battle of Pelennor Fields, one of the biggest in the setting, only featured 100k orcs. A large army to be sure, but hardly the whole species.

For my own homebrew, part of setting it in an earlier time period than most was to explore the relationship between dwarves and elves before the popular racial hatred between the two. Mine were created together by the gods of good to counter evil, and part of that was having to work together. Elves produce the majority of the food, dwarves produce the metals and stonework and other such things needed for production. The two are meant to co-exist.",1470009605

* Melee autists thinks they were born on this Earth to play their game and thinks every other game is absolute shit compared to their party game. This isn't the usual ""my game's better banter"" but legit retarded smugness that they feel superior, when they're playing a basement game from 15 years ago.
* Smash 4 autists all feel entitled to everything because they have the biggest numbers within their Smash group. Doesn't help when some of their most prominent players act like little bitches. Doesn't set a great example.
* Molests cosplayers to the point TO's have to have them protected by security because apparently they don't understand it's not acceptable behavior. They even molested one of their own and pulled the ""LUL was drunk jk jk"" card. This was a sponsored prominent Smash player.
* Hotel pool was closed 2 years in a row because a Smash kid shit in it.
* Takes up more than half the streaming setups in any majors when they aren't even a fighting game reducing the number of games FGC fans really want to see while indie game never even gets a real shot of developing new fans. Oh and they bitch they aren't getting enough.
* Constantly whines they aren't appreciated and threatens to leave and yet when we all tell them to GTFO they still want to cling to the majors because they try to cling to where the cool kids hang out.

"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

"television","t5_2qh6e","1: It's by far the greatest battle in television history

2: The mountain of bodies is a combination of the point where the armies first smashed into each other and a little bit of suspension of disbelief. Yes it doesn't quite make sense. But so do a lot of things. The point is that it isn't too far fetched, made for a cool battle dynamic, and properly set up for the rest of the battle.

3: That's how a shield wall works. The spears are critical to the entire formation.

4: You can't blame the show for your belief in the R + L = J theory that was not put forth by the show nor was guaranteed to even be true. You went in confident on something you shouldn't have necessarily been confident about.

5: This show has already proven it is willing to kill it's main characters at inopportune times. So just because you didn't expect Jon Snow to die at that particular moment doesn't mean he couldn't have. This has lead to something I've seen in a lot of critics and fans alike who claimed they ""knew Jon Snow was going to resurrect/not die at the Battle of The Bastards"" when they actually had no clue. Was it possible? Sure. But it was also totally possible that he was going to die/stay dead. I didn't think something like the Red Wedding could happen but it did. So now people make a correct *prediction* and presume that means they knew something. When in reality it was a good guess.

You see this a lot in real-life. When people are offered two choices and they go with one only to regret it later and then say ""I knew I should have gone with the other choice"". Really you ""*knew*""? I know the answer to 2 + 2 is 4. I don't say 5 because I *know* the answer. You had no idea what to choose or how it was going to end and are now mistaking your suspicions with knowledge. And then equating your false-knowledge with the show's predictability.",1470009610

Since lures and incense don't increase the frequency of rare spawns, the best way to get those is still - in theory - out in the world, either by finding a nest or by just covering a lot of ground and happening upon something good now and again.

Any, non-infected Krogan would likely die-off due to either their warrior culture and/ or only being able to breed with infected Krogan. So you don't need to infect ALL just a fairly sizeable majority. Then Krogan culture would end up culling their own numbers over time. It has been, what, 1000 years since the Krogan Rebellions, right?

By the time of ME3 the only Krogan world is their homeworld, so most of their population is there. And all their females are definitely on the homeworld, so non-infected Krogan would of just died out without any heirs to continue the genophage.

How do you integrate marketing into development and design? Or do you? What kind of marketing is it? Just setting up social media channels and some automatization? Or long term SEO and SEM?

Can you take up 2 or more projects at the same time and simultaneously continue working on them while their both sprint is ongoing?

If your team is rolling them he could be super, likewise then if you're getting hammered it's likely he will just feed kills.

On reflection then he is probably inconsequential to the wins and possibly a factor in the losses.

I've played control point games where a a Bastion has been effective. My team and other team. He is a hero that has such dos capability he warrants respect.

Keep studying other artists styles, not for comparison but for learning and inspiration. 

You're in the right track: Don't try to look for the perfect results; instead try to sketch and doodle more and more and keep exploring unknown areas in your style. From time to time you'll like some new styles that can redefine your style and what you think of it. Moreover, in the short term you'll start applying *improvements* without even knowing you are doing it.

Focus in the practice and ignore the results. Just keep drawing.

Some time ago I watched a [video of Byron Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqV63qRFoUs) teaching how to draw Judy in his caricature style. Look for for [1:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqV63qRFoUs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=95) and you'll see how even Byron Howard says that another artist *is always right*. That blew up my head, and made me think that no matter how big, how famous you are, there will always be this other artist who you'll keep admiring.

So don't hold you back with your drawings and look other works for inspiration, not comparison.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","&gt; To those of you saying they are good because they kill people/act as population control

There is a legitimate argument to be had about that though.  Not just, ""People should die, there's too many!""

But the fact that we keep artificially inflating Africa's population without any consideration as to what that will do to their society.  

We send free food which destroys the local agriculture industry, in turn making them more reliant on the free food.  This balloons the population without doing ANYTHING to increase their own ability to produce food.  Do you have any idea what would happen if we suddenly needed that surplus of food (which is literally why we make it, for national security and famine protection for first world nations) and stopped sending the aid?

Then we have doctors without borders and a bunch of other medical missions.  Most of which have nothing to do with training native doctors or establishing health care systems.

There's plenty more, and I'm no expert, it's just that there IS a legitimate argument that we should be doing different, longer lasting, things to help these people.

But we should certainly just kill all the malaria mosquitoes.  In this instance wiping them all out would only be beneficial, because it DOES actually help contribute to the locals ability to sustain themselves.  As people would have much more time to work instead of having to sit in their homes sweating out a malaria infection.

I didn't really have to go with mom because I didn't like going to the mall just to buy school related stuff haha :D I only wanted video games and toys :D As for clothes, well we've always worn uniforms at school so thankfully I didn't have to suffer through fashion shopping! :D After each schoolyear, mom would give away my books and notebooks to other kids. 

During vacation time, I'd play video games and watch horror movies day and night because I had an agreement with mom and dad that I won't play games whenever it's active school time. My discipline was extreme, I actually did that from the beginning of elementary until the end of highschool lol! When I was in college, I just played whenever I wanted to.

College was different. Different professors, different books. I had to find whatever was needed myself. Sometimes I'd even buy other books through my own research just so I could learn more. There were certain things that I wanted to learn that weren't taught in my course (I studied computer science but I also wanted to learn 3d modeling, animation, and more in-depth game development). 

Anyway, with how we can almost buy anything online nowadays, I think a lot of people don't even have to get their butts off the chair or bed anymore. Do people even need to buy books? When my second girlfriend was in college, I even hunted expensive books for her on the net so she could have them for free lol :) She saved hundreds or even thousands of dollars :D

I wonder how the younger people are taking notes nowadays. Do they bring laptops to school and just type notes in there? Are notebooks going to be obsolete soon? Do they even need to carry around giant heavy books when almost every published material has a digital version already? I wonder what it's like to be an elementary, highschool, and college kid again in modern times haha :D

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","&gt; I don't want to learn a language that is written with weird and oftentimes otherwise non-existent characters

Although Esperanto does contain several non-traditional characters, many conlangs, such as the one I speak (Ido), does not.

&gt; Since its inception in the late 18th or 19th century, it has conquered an overall 2 million people?

There are many reasons why Esperanto has failed in gaining popular support, many of them political. But the biggest reason I've always believed is due to the failure of the Conlanger Community to unite behind one specific conlang and promote its use and development. Esperanto is the biggest, but there are *thousands upon thousands* more conlangs, and each one's community of course believes that their conlang alone should be the one the rest of the world adopts. The conlang community, although pretty friendly as a whole, is splintered beyond belief when it comes to the popular adoption by a government or other large body of a conlang as its official language. As an Idist, I'd be fairly hypocritical if I didn't take my fair share of the blame in this. The conlang I speak, Ido, was responsible for the initial split amongst what was at the time a fairly large and unified population of Esperanto speakers around the world. It undoubtedly set the conlang movement back quite a bit, as the Ido split destroyed the momentum the Esperanto movement had going at the time, which was significant.

**TL;DR** - Not all conlangs have goofy characters like Esperanto. And the failure of Esperanto and other conlangs to have any real impact doesn't have to do to any real problems within the languages themselves as much as it has to do with the mass splintering of the Conlanger community and the failure to unite behind a single conlang.",1470009613

I HAVE HAD TWO 




One night I happened to wake up about 2:30 in the morning. It was one of those times where you snap completely awake (not groggy or anything). Since I had been sleeping my eyes were adjusted to the dark room. I sat there for about 30 seconds or so and glanced at the clock. Then I looked toward the door that led into he hallway. Standing there in the doorway was a large black Silhouette that took up most of the doorframe. The thing about it was that it was dark. I mean pitch black. Even though my eyes were adjusted to the room this was so dark I couldn't see through it. It moved to the foot of my bed, stayed there for a good 10 seconds, then it faded away. 










The second time I experienced anything was a little while after the first. Maybe several months at least. In this instance I was dreaming and having a nightmare. In the nightmare was a voice that was speaking to me and it mentioned something like, ""I'm here"" and then I snapped awake and my entire set of bedsheets flew across the room. ",1470009616

"startups","t5_2qh26","Not controlling your data is the only issue with web software and it isn't that big of an issue. Web software providers are not in the business of loosing data or they would loose their business. If you are really worried, pick one who allows you to download all your data.

Uptime is the opposite to what your impression is. Running software locally, you might best be able to get 99% uptime, where most web software companies can provide 99.9% uptime - an 8 fold decrease in downtime (http://uptime.is/99), if they give you 99.99% uptime that is a 72 fold decrease.

Migration can be done via API or downloading your data (if its offered). Migration seems like a great idea until you realise the only company in the world that makes the software you need is the company you are using.

Updates like the ones you are talking about suck - removing features makes things difficult for customers.

Other benefits of cloud software:

* That web software you pay $5 per month to use, cost $10 million to write - where else in the world can you get prices like that? 
* Updates for web software are given to everyone at once, you get them for free, there is never someone on a different version.
* Never a worry about your operating system
* Never have to carry your desktop around because its the only computer that has the software you need. You can work anywhere on any device
* If your computer breaks just buy a new one because your software works on any device.
* web companies spend huge amounts of money on security, the only security most businesses have is a modem with a firewall.",1470009617

One who is a good friend of mine is into competitive powerlifting and does kickboxing and likes to try all kinds of things from rowing to cross country hiking. It takes a week to be certified but you won't be certified unless you're athletically competent. I've never heard any coaches at my gym tell people to work through an injury.

It's mostly a question of the weight of the head and the beauty dish you're using and how much weight you need to counter balance that. 

If it's relatively light weight, go with /u/rideThe's suggestion. If it's a little beefier, or you plan to work with more heavy duty stuff in the future then invest in a c/stand and that miniboom arm. ",1470009620

That being said, there are ways. Tasers have a maximum range of 20 m, so if security can control the engagement area, the drones are in trouble. You can also give security better armour. Full body armour with a helmet and Nonconductivity 6 will go a long way towards stopping taser darts. 

Alternatively, you can take an electronic approach. An HTR decker can be ""on the scene"" much sooner than physical HTR officers, making Data Spike attacks against the rigger's RCC. Local staff could deploy jammers, which at a sufficient level will disable the RCC. Without the RCC, the drones can only roll 8 dice to attack at best. ",1470009621

"tf2","t5_2qka0","This entire update confuses me. 

Maybe when Valve's janitor finished coding Matchmaking, Jill thought to himself ""Hey, this *looks* pretty good, maybe we should replace pubs with this, too!"" And they then copy and pasted it over pubs and expected everyone to be totally fine with abandonment penalties and no auto balance on **Casual** mode; that or they expected everyone to be too distracted by the new taunts to care.

After finishing these new spaghetti gamemods, one of the unnamed TF2-focussed Valve employees went, ""Oh, wait, we almost forgot to patch the weapons.""

And during the patching process, Jill stumbled across /r/bisonmasterrace and thought ""Hey, all these people LOVE the Bison, it must be OP"" and went on to turn the Bison into a revolver that shoots slow moving pieces of cotton candy.

""Hey, do you think we should test out these new changes?"" Another TF2 Valve employee said. Everyone on the development room had a good hearty laugh at the hilarious joke their co-worker had said.

During this enjoyable state of affairs, the rest of the TF2 team and the janitor were all trying to find out if they should buff Heavy or Pyro.

""Well, we can't do BOTH at the same time!"" Said Jill, obviously. 

""Eh fuck it let's just have the community decide for us."" Said one employee. Upon saying this, said employee was promoted into the vice-president positon at Valve.

Jill then went to the comic makers held captive in the basement and said ""MAKE A COMIC OR I'M NOT FEEDING YOU THIS MONTH.""

When all was said and done, Valve presented the literal game changing update to B4nny, their husbando. Upon seeing that the filthy pub experience had been gassed out, he used his raging boner to type out how neato it was.

Valve was so happy that senpai noticed them, they decided no further """"""""""""testing"""""""""""" was needed, and shipped out the update.

However, that isn't where our story ends, as the big bad community was not happy. And Valve slowly but surely patched out some of the things the eeeeeevil community didn't like. 

Jill, in the time of despair, had to say that the update didn't have the best launch, despite the fact that deep down inside, he knew this was the best update him and his team had ever made.

Somewhat satisfied, the evil, fun-hating community went back into it's dank cave that it called ""Reddit"" and shat on itself a bit.

After the amazing adventure he and his team had, Jill laid down, and took his well deserved rest...

"stocks","t5_2qjfk","Dumbed down version: call buyers bet that the stock goes up. Put buyers bet that the stock goes down. If a person is right, they tend to win money. If the stock is unchanged of moves against him/her, they tend to lose. Decay can be a factor, so sometimes a pretty big move is needed. Like horse betting, a person can bet with good odds for a small payout, or take a flyer on long odds, with low probability of profit.

Most option buyers sell their contracts to close the position. Too many novices think about exercising, which almost never happens. The exception is when there is a significant dividend involved, or the options are not liquid (wide bid/ask spread).

Options are complicated. They are not for everyone. If a person is confused, perhaps study more, and if still confused, it might be best to avoid them. Those that need things dumbed down to 5-year old level, may not have the right mind set for options trading. Maybe 5% of stock market investors do much with options, and almost all the ones that I have met are pretty smart, and good with integer math. The dumb ones (the ones that have a 5-year old's intellect) tend to lose their money pretty quick.

Notice that your motivations are selfish as well -- you have chosen certain friends because they suit your needs. You aren't being altruistic here. That's not a criticism. You ignore others because they don't suit your needs. You are only considering yourself.

They are too, but in a different way. These other people have the need for social fulfillment, which they seek from you. This is no more or less selfish than your actions, but this specific selfishness has been collectively condoned for the betterment of people in general, under the assumption that most or all people will have the same desires. ""You meet my social needs and I'll meet yours"". 

Given that this mode of selfishness is considered acceptable, your violation of the unspoken social rule is considered uncouth. One might consider it more selfish than their actions, as they are acting according to a rule which meets the social needs of most people, as opposed to only themselves. In your actions, you meet only your needs, not theirs. Of course, they can't meet your needs, though they don't know that. (I am not endorsing this opinion, only considering it)

All the mods really did to promote canwc was sticky the first thread and change some text for, like 2 weeks before changing it back. It could be argued that they also promoted it through the livestreams, but those were more for the canwc albums, which were a community project. Not promoting them would have had the people who made them angry.

This sub's humor, mostly. In case you haven't noticed, this sub is full of shitposts, so a comic with shitpost humor is pretty much made for this sub. However, it also has Rose, providing a level headed ""straight man"" for people who don't really like shitpost humor to relate to. 

No. Rose's writing is solid and there's a good level of mystery hiding behind all the dumb bullshit. It also takes a lot of effort to make art this hilariously bad.

I don't think shitposters are really assholes 100% of the time, and even then the assholes are few and far between. Besides that, Homestuck's ironic since of humor attracts people who would be into canwc's even more ironic humor. And again, Rose provides a straight man for people who don't like shitpost humor.",1470009623

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","Well, think of it this way; 


We're getting STAR WARS movies that look amazing and have good stories on a super regular basis. We can't really complain. 


The reason they cut the EU from canon and made legends leaves them free to cherry pick the best stories (or fuse stories) and make more great movies. They obviously didn't cut it that way JUST to free up the saga films. Thrawn is already coming to Rebels and from the small snip we got it's the Thrawn from the books... not some shell of a character. 


I'll eat my computer before I believe that they don't have plans for the other heavy hitting Legends characters... Revan and Bane included. 



Look what Marvel is doing vs DC; give SW time to lay out the long game instead of throwing these heavy hitters at us before they can give them the gravitas they deserve simply to shut us up.",1470009623

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","This is a pretty fair explanation, but does miss out on its bigger downsides. Most notably, it's not particularly fun to watch sometimes, as games often end with a whimper. It can also feel discouraging to play as comebacks are extremely unlikely when the other team has already set a good time. Even if you play well, you're just running out the clock on your loss. 

Time bank mostly solves these by having a more spirited back and forth and allowing overtime for more clutch comebacks to be possible. It's biggest problem is probably how long it can take, but I always liked longer games so meh. I'm definitely happy they are going with bank over stopwatch. ",1470009623

Personally I don't view this like the typical Silicon Valley startup that gets lucky with a popular social app, where everyone forgets about it by next year. The Line app is really just a portal for the Line Corp businesses to interface with millions of people.

I think Line Corp has an intriguing strategy, where they're not trying to build an empire on software alone. They are developing local businesses, that involve real world value, and bringing it all together using mobile software and internet technology.

Is being pure consciousness a state? Is it something that comes and goes, or needs to be maintained?

An enlightened one does nothing, they simply know they're not the doer. The karma/action that is happening will continue to move as part of the dance of the cosmos. To the outside observer it will appear as though the enlightened one thinks, and acts, and says, and does. Within consciousness, thoughts, feelings, sensations will arise, but they belong to nobody.

Enlightenment isn't about what's arising in consciousness, but seeing the truth in it. It's a matter of clearing up false identification with the volitional entity. Once the truth is apperceived, then the false beliefs which have dominated consciousness burn up in the fires of truth. 

Before you worry about stilling of mind, or anything else you've read about what enlightenment should feel like or be like, look in direct experience and recognize that there's nothing to attain and nowhere to get, because the truth is this, what is, right now.",1470009627

I think I would be *really* upset to hear that. And I can understand how your gut response would be to lash back out at the two of them, that would be my gut response too.

But the important thing is to realise that lashing out like that doesn't really fix the problem, does it? It's not going to make him stop saying what he's saying, it won't change anything, and to be honest it will actually just cement yourself into the 'crazy ex' position, which will probably make them even closer to each other.

He sounds like an asshole, and pretending you two didn't have anything is pretty gross.

I think you should start by apologising to the girl, and explain to her that your ex pretending you two didn't have anything at all really hurt you, and you took your anger out on her, which really wasn't very fair to her.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","This post is a week old. I'm flattered. Truly.

&gt;Except that it isn't a 5 star match...

Except it's an entirely subjective system for a fake sport in which the only real, objective measure is money. Meltzer isn't some infallible critic devoid of subjectivity or an axe against Hogan. What's his formula - feud+draw+workrate, right? Fine, the ""workrate"" sucks, but the other two factors are certainly there. So ""LOL I raised it a -1*"" from Meltzer is him being even more petty than he was then because now he has the benefit of historical context. The only people who care about rating systems and ""workrates"" are 1) fans who think matches with ""flippy shit"" but 0 crowd reaction are masterpieces; and 2) wrestlers who receive a favorable rating (until they receive a shitty one and then they bury Meltzer, who at the end of the day, is and always has been a nerd trying to hang with cooler kids).

&gt;I was 8 years old and didn't know shit about wrestling I thought it was boring.

And yet, an arena full of people, many of whom older than you and knew shit about wrestling, still popped at the end and cheered as Hogan did his routine. Because they were into it; WWE today would shit their pants in delight for a fraction of that. Again, look at RAW, everyone is sitting on their hands. It's the *event* fans cheer for today, not the match.

&gt;Nobody likes this match, it's not good.

"civ","t5_2rk3b","You don't need to use super-specific competitive strategies to win. Well, there are a few givens: you need to take Rationalism and Liberty is generally the better starting policy tree over Tradition in the mod (but both are viable). Ask to ban Rationalism in your game if you don't want it. Chances are your lobby will be willing to oblige, because Rationalism is very centralizing to the metagame. You could also ask to get Great Library banned, as well as Hubble if you don't like those wonders either.

Build scouts early-game, one if not two. Scouts get ruins for you, they discover other civilizations, they scout enemy lands, and do a lot of other things. Scouts are important; do not let them die easily or without a fight. On the same note, get a worker early by stealing one from a city-state or building one, preferably both. This will let you get your cities going much more quickly than usual. 

Focus on expanding early and getting your cities out quickly. Your first settler should come before turn 20 if at all possible, and have 1 if not 2 cities settled by turn 25-30. Liberty empires should time their settlers with the double-production-on-settlers policy and Tradition empires should start once they're at 3-4 pop, 5 if you can make it there. Getting your expands out quickly will cement your position and prevent your opponents from taking your lands. 

Check demographics often. Check army score: who's first army? Are they near you? How near? Is it likely they're going to war sometime soon? Think as if though you're in their shoes, and see whether or not you'd be a potential target to them early-game. Check science score: who's the science leader? are they close to you? how high is their lead? maybe you can stop them if you tech straight to crossbows right now? Asking questions like these is the way to start doing well; in a FFA, you have to be hyper-aware of your situation and always need a victory plan in mind.

That's just the atmosphere in a competitive community. Civ is no exception, unfortunately. You can ignore the ""tryhards"" who say you're bad because they're probably not very good either (good players don't talk smack about clueless players, good players ignore clueless players). Don't feel bad if you don't do well at first, because you're new and yes, it's very hard, civ is a hard game. I highly recommend you don't abandon the NQ community because it's pretty much the only multiplayer community for civ, competitive or otherwise. Watch FilthyRobot's videos: he's very good and watching will improve your game by leaps and bounds. But if you really aren't satisfied with it, you probably won't be finding another community to play multiplayer with, especially with the NQMod outside of the NQ community.",1470009634

He came out a few mins later and handed me something through the window and said 'here you go!'. I didn't wait for him to come around the car and get into the drivers seat, I bit straight into this odd looking thing he had got for me.

It was fucking disgusting. He got in the car and looked in amazement as I sad there looking upset and confused with [dried cuttlefish](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mj-mxWYsDbkP2mLMBRs5Xsg.jpg) falling out of my mouth.

The biggest thing that helped me improve my game is learning map control and communication, and how to be mobile and exploit  the other team's mistakes. 

Individually,  I'mnot a fantastic player,  and my kd is still negative as a result of my how bad I was in year 1. But I play crucible regularly with friends I made though the game,  and as a team we work really well.  

If you can,  play with a crucible sherpa. It's not a guaranteed carry,  but they try to teach you good playing habits and how to think under pressure. Also add friends you can play crucible with regularly,  this makes it much more enjoyable, especially in trials. If you run with a regular team,  you can improve together and become more effective than your individual gun skill suggests. ",1470009636

I spent my first year as a Cavalry Scout sweeping helipad's in the middle of nowhere. Performing daily vehicle maintenance. Cleaning our motor pools. Ducking and dodging any officer that came into my general area. Going to so many gunnery's and being stuck as fire guard since I was a dismount. Then to be giving orders to Iraq in January 2003 and finally going over there and chasing so many bullshit ass claims of WMD's. Spending 12 months in that hell hole woke me up and changed every belief about our government/military. I cannot for the life of me go to sleep without Ambien, I don't like going near anyone or getting close. Every dream I have is about death and suffer from deep depression. Which led me to attempt suicide on numerous occasions. Was giving multiple prescriptions of antipsychotics.

"NoMansSkyTheGame","t5_325lr","Let's make this clear, your assumption is that the game will include such a large galaxy map, that it will be next to impossible to coordinate a meet-up by simply using one target solar system-name as a meetup spot.


My assumption is that the game will be large, but still small enough in a way that it doesn't take more than a little extra effort for multiple people to find one solar system system. 


For example, if I had 10 buddies that wanted to play with me. I assume we could all pick a solar system with a name that stands out. And we could all meet eachother.  From different parts of the map. No matter where we are, as long as the names aren't randomly generated, I don't see how it's impossible for us to simple choose a name that sticks out. 

Tie Breaker: **Chances are** the game actually just works in instances, and not a giant overworld. Meaning, it's actually impossible to seamlessly meet 20+ people in the same solar system simply because the game is designed to put 4 people who happen to be in the same loading zone all into the same game. 


Final note: I do honestly believe the game map will be massive. But I don't see how it's impossible for players to find eachother unless the game is simply designed only to que a select number of players into the same world at once. 

Meaning the map could still be massive, but easier to manage since everything is instanced based like a dungeon or someshit. 

In all honesty, we're both probably right and wrong. You're right the map is massive. I'm right that picking a solar system's name to use as a target location over blindly traveling from planet to planet could be a viable way to meet friends. 

But I expect the game to not seamlessly allow 20+ people to interact, but rather a more reasonable number in a set instance like 4. or 8. or 12.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","I drove solo from Rochester NY to Dallas TX in 2 &amp; 1/2 days once. 

Day one was 9 hours in the car (after six+ on a plane), day two was 17 hours in the car, day 3 was about 5. 

1) Change seating position every couple of hours. I alternate between leaning back comfortably and sitting nearly upright to break the monotony and shift the pressure on my body to different spots so it wouldn't get quite as uncomfortable. Heated seats are great if you start getting sore, for short bursts.

2) Coffee. Lots of coffee. 

3) I almost always drive with music. If you do, vary it up some. Alternate between genres to break up the boredom. 

4) Having a passenger will be great. You don't have to talk all of the time but if you're getting weary and uncomfortable it'll keep you awake. 

5) Stretch. If you're feeling a bit drowsy you can stretch (like by pushing your arms forward to stretch your upper back).

6) Chewing gum. If you/passenger aren't averse to it, it's a great trick to keep yourself attentive. I went through a 15pc pack on my trip, easy. Also great because coffee breath sucks. 

7) Make sure you get a good nights rest beforehand. Make sure all the fluids in your car are topped up and good to go. ",1470009640

Something that will shake your life up in an exciting and refreshing way.  And when you get good at something, it fills you with newfound confidence as well.  This kind of thing can really impact your energy and personality in positive ways.  Some people just need to hit the reset button you know?  So go out there and try some new things!

Dear Madam,
 
I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.
 
I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save.
 
I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours, to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of Freedom. Yours, very sincerely and respectfully,
 
Abraham Lincoln

Trenja so bila tukaj in tam, predvsem so trenja nastala iz cerkve ampak nikdar se niso ta trenja razvila v nič pomembnega. Sem vesel, da Josip ni šel po Stalinovi poti in začel pobijati toliko ljudi zaradi ideologije med 2. sv. vojno, ker to vsi vemo, da pač nemore delati. Stalinova tako kot Hitlerjeva mentaliteta je bila, da se ubije to generacijo kulakov oz. židov v drugem primerju in da potem to več nebo potrebno, ker bo druga generacija drugačna. Problem je, ker tako nemoreš nikdar priti do druge generacije, enostavno ne bo uspelo. 

Ja se je kar nekaj ljudi pobilo po vojni ampak mislim, da je to zaradi samega trenja med vojno in predvsem maščevalno in mislim, da to komando res niso dobili od Josipa ampak so sami odločili kazen posamezni vojaki.

Diktatorstvo ni držalo skupaj ljudi ampak jo je držal voditelj in tudi če bi bile volitve vsake 4 leta, mislim, da bi še vedno imeli enakega voditelja.

You seem very concerned only with how marijuana will help you and only you. Second, the only evidence you have that it's safe for your baby is your completely uneducated guess that it's okay because your anatomy scan seemed fine (hint: anatomy scans check anatomy, not brain development). Medically, there is not enough evidence that it's safe to use in pregnancy. Common sense would say it's not entirely safe, so why risk it? If you have unbearable anxiety and depression, you need to get help for those independently, because they're not going to get any better once you become a parent.

Honestly, I would have to say that as time goes by, you will heal. Surround yourself in a positive environment that encourages you. As more time goes by,  you will realize that these things aren't real and there are good scientific explanations for paranormal phenomena. Just dig around on the internet for scientific evidence that these beings don't exist.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","You will be less effective when you check your practice. Checking means you are not meditating, you are stepping outside the situation to 'see how it's going', and compare, judge, label, and control. Checking is a major problem.

The reason you check is because you are not committed to the practice. The cause of this is often doubt that arises because you haven't learned a proven traditional method, haven't learned the method well, haven't learned it from a verified source, and/or haven't had its effects modeled for you by someone who has attained them. Because you are not sure what you are doing and why, your mind jumps out of practice and tries to figure out if it's working. That is the mind sickness called *checking*.

But even if checking weren't a problem, one session, one day, one week, even one month may not be enough to go on. You will have ups and downs. Many other influences come into play — your physical situation, whether you have food in your stomach, whether you're tired, your mental situation, your emotional situation, what's been happening in your relationships, how your day has been going, what triggers and attachments have come up for you... what the weather is like.... You don't necessarily know why your meditation has the quality it has from moment to moment.

Next, you don't know whether your clarity or experience are a result of a nearby cause, something that is happening now or happened just a minute ago; or the result of a distant cause, something that happened last week or last year or last lifetime, and is only now coming to fruition.

Finally, you don't yet know what constitutes success in meditation. If *easy* meditation indicates success, then you might as well sit on the porch and blow bubbles. Sometimes you make a great deal more progress when things feel difficult than you do when they feel easy. It's like those dreams where you feel that you're running very slowly, but actually you're passing cars and motorcycles.

If you want to try using a *mala*, learn a proper traditional method, and learn it well. But first you need to at least *start* to clarify your reason for meditating. ""Why meditate?"" means ""Why do anything in life? Why stay alive and try something — for what purpose?"" Your practice should further your life purpose. If it is not furthering your life purpose, it is a waste of time.

~

Many millions of practitioners use malas/prayer beads. Many millions of practitioners do not use malas/prayer beads. Either way is fine. What is the aim, and how do you use your mind: that is what matters.

For those counting repetitions, or for those seeking more support from the sense of touch (another way to ground oneself and return to the simple, present moment) a mala is very useful.

Doesn't matter I don't think the distinction really diminishes the person grieve and pain. Deep lost or sacrifice, it's still painful. I have no emotional attachment to either parties. OP's lack of empathy isn't going to win him any points with people, but what he's saying is right. 

I will say it was poor choice of time to bring up the Muslim debate for trump. The other side even when it's the right time people are EXTREMELY fearful of criticizing Islam. It doesn't help that many will assume like in this case that all Muslims follow particular practices, and prejudges in general toward specific Muslims.  However it is an issue. 

Any idea, or set of ideas should be allowed to be criticized fairly. It wasn't (and still might not be completely) the case with Christianity. That eventually needs to be the case.

...Just not on the backs of people who suffered a lost of child. Though I am going to be honest. I do feel empathy to a degree... it's been 12 years (from what I read), and they do not seem to have a problem with speak at a political convention about it. I myself if I chose to do that would feel a level of responsibility to accept political rebuttal. If I didn't want to involve politics, but want to use a public platform to share a story or gain something positive from speaking about it, I would use a better venue.

It's all that Schumer shit run rampant and everyone needs to make sure they get across the Very Important Fact that women = funny. If they thought it was so-so, there's about a 1% chance that you won't see the word 'potential' at some point, preceded by things like ""mountains of"" or ""oodles of"" or ""overflowing with"".

It also allows them to avoid having to discuss the actual agenda itself, kind of ironically. Meaning the fact of the movie implanting the agenda. 'Hey, it's a great cast, what else do you want out of movie critic-ing? I did my job so there ya go.'

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm a bit of a black sheep in the family because I've always dressed in torn up clothes with spikes, and I've gotten criticisms from my extended family since childhood about my unladylike behaviour. 

Every year, my family would gather at my uncles house to celebrate his sobriety. He used to be an alcoholic but quit when his first son was born. His part of the family hardly speaks english, and my parents never taught me Spanish so I would just kind of awkwardly sit there or play in one of the rooms by myself. The most I would say to my uncle was ""Hello."" ""How are you? Good."" ""Bye.""

When I was in highschool his first son, the reason he quit drinking, died in a drunk driving related accident at age 19. My cousin was a passenger, in the back middle seat of a full car. Somehow he was the only one fatally injured. We had spent 2 weeks visiting him in the hospital before we let him go. We spent Christmas eve burying him.

Months later we gathered again to celebrate my uncles continued sobriety, and took the time to reflect on our lost family member.
I sat quietly on the couch listening to my family's spanglish banter. My uncle came up to me and said ""No matter what you do, people will be unhappy. So don't change yourself."" 

I was stunned. He had never opened up conversation with me before. That meant so much to me. I'm crying as I type this. That's the first time an extended family member has told me it's ok to be myself.

I was always the type that was disinterested in drinking, getting high or doing drugs. After the above happened and some other experiences in my life that followed I officially declared myself straight edged.

I'm well past the age 21 and believe it or not I get criticized all the time for this. I get scoffed at and asked ""why?"" I simply say that there are a lot of reasons and don't bother elaborating.",1470009661

The items work, but they were used to invest into a ""character"" and that investment is now meaningless because the core part of the game, which was advertised and touted, is now gone. I made those purchases thinking the game would remain a tracking game. 

I understand as a developer you might be a little more not-picky with the details of such a refund for an in app purchase but I hope you too can see where we are coming from as consumers. We don't enjoy investing into something that's going to be pulled from us. Hopefully Niantic will understand too or this will be a great waste of potential.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I very much doubt it'd make anything faster. A tactical timeout would probably be 2 minutes on each side. That's 4 minutes being added to the game time right of the bat (10-15% longer games with an average game time). What would a timeout be used for most likely? To stall out the game, make macro plays, lay down vision, establish lane assignments, etc. 


Most of the aggressive tactical decisions are already being made before the game, in champion select and in the prep work in scrims. I don't think a tactical timeout would add much besides refocusing the team on something like a baron or dragon play. In CSGO the plays you can make are often very diverse and you can actually plan out something and adjust. In League you can't change champions/summoners/items mid game. So the calls you can make are very limited. You don't need a coach to tell you that your Ashe/Bard/Shen/Hecarim/Vlad comp should probably look for hard engages and team fights. Or that your Jax comp should look to splitpush.


Personally I think adding a coach to the comms is highly preferable. You have someone that can refocus the team and has a more birds eye view of the map. He can guide the team in terms of tactical decisions and make the tiny adjustments during the game (for instance how to setup the splitpush for the Jax or to urge his team to pull the trigger) that he could make during a pause.",1470009661

Reagan did that. He won nearly every state not because he was conservative, but because of the way he talked about America.

Trump is doing the same thing except he isn't as eloquent as Reagan and he is speaking during a time of uncertainty.

Sanders has a different populist message, one that is anti-capitalism. His message resonates with the young and naive. It is very easy to be a populist to the younger generation.

Trump being able to speak to middle America is a testament to the power of his message.",1470009663

"StarWarsEU","t5_2tg71","&gt;Bottom line Dooku is way out of Obi Wans league to the point where if dooku is going all out Obi wan can't put up a fight against him (unless he was given some huge edge) therefor the same applies to vos who is way beyond Dooku.

Ok, I'm done here.  You don't seem to understand the point I'm making.  Fights in Star Wars are not mathematical equations.  Dooku can easily defeat Obi Wan, yet Obi Wan defeated Anakin who easily defeated Dooku.  Do you see how these kind of comparisons don't work?  Rarely are things a straight up fight, which is why sending someone ""weaker"" doesn't mean they are guaranteed to lose.  There are other factors, like subterfuge and manipulation, that can change things.  Obi Wan defeated Darth Maul, because of luck and such.  I didn't say this as an example of why Vos could defeat Dooku, I used it as an example of how playing the Star Wars Power Level game doesn't work.  Fights are not determined ""X is stronger than Y, so X would always win"" which is how you keep describing things.

Arguing with you is pointless though, because no one could possibly understand Star Wars the way you do.  Rather than try to have an intelligent discussion, you resort to name calling to try to make yourself feel better.  Good for you I guess, but don't get surprised anymore when people downvote you without talking back.",1470009664

and if you enlist them? what then? what benefit will you get out of them besides commanders having to deal with their shit all day (especially because they don't want to be there in the first place), having to allocate resources to their specifically tailored service terms, and finding new unneeded jobs for them?  
really, whats the benefit besides ""sticking it to them"", or satisfying our collective ""joined burden"" feelings? I truly hope the army doesnt resort to acting on feelings rather than cold hard facts (well, to be frank its sort of happening now, but not in this way).

Transfercase in neutral and the transmission is isolated.  It doesn't turn at all.  So no lubrication problems.

&gt;Its in the owners manual for the pathfinder

Which pathfinder is that?  The current one (which is a maxima on stilts with no transfer case) or all the previous generations (decades of them) with a transfer case)?

&gt;The only way to know the answer for any vehicle is to check the owners manual or service handbook.

"golf","t5_2qhcs","There are two main types of airflow that come into contact with a surface. Laminar flow and turbulent flow. 

Laminar boundary layers are the initial flow on a smooth surface. They produce less drag but are also less stable and less likely to ""stick"" to the surface. 

Turbulent boundary layers produce a little more drag but are thicker and stickier. They stay attached to the surface for longer. Laminar flows normally turn into turbulent flows on a smooth aerodynamic surface like a wing or fin. 

As a ball is round and not particularly aerodynamic, the boundary layer (whatever type it is) will separate from the surface fairly early, normally slightly behind the mid-point. As soon as the air separates, a ""wake"" is formed. You can see this as the big eddies that are formed behind a boat. This wake produces a LOT of drag, and drag is bad if you want the ball to go further. So it follows that you'd want to reduce the wake. How do we do this?

Remember the differences between laminar and turbulent boundary layers? Laminar has less drag but isn't as sticky. We want more sticky because more sticky means a bigger boundary layer which means a later separation which gives us a smaller wake. We make the boundary layer turbulent by adding dimples. These dimples disturb the laminar flow just enough to make it turbulent without forcing it to separate. Bam, smaller wake, less drag. 

TL;DR Turbulent boundary layer=stickier flow=later separation=smaller wake=less drag.

What is a problem is guys taking 2-3 burst from a pulse rifle, to the head and then drag scope with a high aim assist sniper and win the engagement.  

No unbiased person can say that is fair.  Several of those clips where people getting shot several times at optimal range for the primary (hence full damage numbers) turning and quick scoping head shots.  Either snipers need to have their aim assist severely neutered or primaries need to be significant buffed.  Back in year one, all of these guys would have been dead from thorn, tlw, red death, messenger, hopscotch etc, before they ever had time to turn around and quick scope.

Actually I got a lot of advice here, really informative post in my history. 

But a lot of people recommended taking a lot of time off between draft, some recommended giving up on my first book being worth it entirely!

I ended up taking about a month off and, I gotta say, I don't think you should be worried about losing it. For me that time between was a godsend. The ideas didn't stop swimming for a second, but not having to force them into a page made me way better at evaluating story elements objectively. 

Basically a little time off helped me ""kill my darlings,"" the ones that needed killing at least.

So I'd say don't worry about the time off, think of it as if you still have to work on your book but all the work happens in your head in your private moments. Your commute, your shower, before you go to sleep at night. 

As long as you keep thinking about it, the time between drafts can be extremely beneficial.",1470009671

I'm not experienced with a compost toilet and such problem, but i know if you keep it too dry and more damp instead of wet, the flies will even like it more.

http://www.supergreenme.com/go-green-environment-eco:How-To-Keep-Insects-Out-of-a-Composting-Toilet
note from article: Some insecticides will simply break down.

And for pest control:

http://www.getridoffliesguide.com/#FlyControlTechniques

Meticulously look for the pupated larvae, these buggers can crawl quite far and will hide everywhere, where you have to look twice for them. Had that in a flat with a roommate who hastily dumped food in the bin and went on vacation while i was away too. Jesus, they were everywhere. Behind and under every shelve from kitchen, every bed, closet and wardrobe. Vacuum it. Dispose.

Clean all the fly spots.

Buy more fly straps, they are not that expensive, but several hommade traps will catch them too. Search the net, you basically need a big plastic bottle, a knife and a few household ingredients.


Procedure from a blog:

""So when anyone complains about flies in their composting toilet they have to realise they came from their house first. Okay so first step is to get rid of flies in house so we had to use the nasty Raid stuff one day when the kids would be away all day, it worked, i also sprayed it into the toilet just so i could get working on a solution. Okay now we have got rid of all flies, next step was to kill the larvae in the toilet, you can use the Dunk tablets which are used in ponds and are safe for the compost, break them up and put in a spray bottle full of water let soak and spray toilet every time its used for 10 days. The larvae ingest the solution which then cracks and kills them. Now how to keep the flies from wantng to come in the toilet and lay eggs. I was able to find one of those insect killer plastic sticks which usually hang in unoccupied rooms to kill flies when owners are away. i can easily hang these inside the drum at the rear left side and does not provide any obstruction to use other than remembering to remove when rotating drum. So thats it,. Its been 2 months since the fly issue and we have continued to have hot weather and have never seen a fly come out of the composting toilet since. When i eventually get the walls made for the toilet the flies will have less access to the toilet also. ""

This is simple logic, I don't understand why you think it's a controversial idea. I'll try to speak slowly. Open source material, for example, has no restrictions of it's use - it can be traded openly. Copyrighted material *has restrictions* on it's use, and cannot be traded openly, it requires (state-enforced) permissions from the rights-holder. That is a restriction, whether it is ethical and justified is a separate issue. 

Patent and copyright law is legal protection from competition, giving owners the right to monopolize the market for a limited time, protecting the rights-holder's financial interest in their work. It follows that when this concept is applied to international trade, it should be considered a form of protectionism, because that's literally what it is - protecting the an exclusive legal right to the individual patent-holder and restricting it's use by other individuals.

&gt;just copy paste a quote that has someone (anyone!) claiming that ""intellectual property is a restriction on trade"" 

OK. Here's economist Dean Baker:

&gt;The conservative framing of issues is so deeply embedded that it has been widely accepted by ostensibly neutral actors, such as policy professionals or the news media that report on national politics. For example, news reports routinely refer to bilateral trade agreements, such as NAFTA or CAFTA, as “free trade” agreements. This is in spite of the fact that one of the main purposes of these
agreements is to increase patent protection in developing countries, effectively increasing the length and force of government-imposed monopolies. **Whether or not increasing patent protection is desirable policy, it clearly is not “free trade.”**

&gt;Of course patent and copyright protection serves a purpose as do all forms of protectionism. They are a mechanism that the government uses to provide incentives for innovation and creative work. However, the relevant question from the standpoint of determining public policy is whether these are the best mechanisms for this purpose. It isn’t possible to seriously answer this question, unless we first recognize that there are other possible ways to finance innovation and creative work and then to compare the costs and benefits of the various alternative mechanisms. 

&gt;- Dean Baker, [*The Conservative Nanny State*](http://deanbaker.net/images/stories/documents/cnswebbook.pdf) 

Further, from the ""protectionism"" entry on Wikipedia:
&gt;In the modern trade arena many other initiatives besides tariffs have been called protectionist. For example, some commentators...point out that free trade agreements often have protectionist provisions such as intellectual property, copyright, and patent restrictions that benefit large corporations. These provisions restrict trade in music, movies, pharmaceuticals, software, and other manufactured items to high cost producers with quotas from low cost producers set to zero.

&gt;International patent systems: There is an argument for viewing national patent systems as a cloak for protectionist trade policies at a national level. Two strands of this argument exist: one when patents held by one country form part of a system of exploitable relative advantage in trade negotiations against another, and a second where adhering to a worldwide system of patents confers ""good citizenship"" status despite 'de facto protectionism'. Peter Drahos explains that ""States realized that patent systems could be used to cloak protectionist strategies. There were also reputational advantages for states to be seen to be sticking to intellectual property systems. One could attend the various revisions of the Paris and Berne conventions, participate in the cosmopolitan moral dialogue about the need to protect the fruits of authorial labor and inventive genius...knowing all the while that one's domestic intellectual property system was a handy protectionist weapon.""

"RedPillWives","t5_3ddkr","&gt; Even if people misuse the term it still has an objective meaning. And if a woman who isn’t promiscuous is constantly being called a slut and assumed to be promiscuous that should be a wakeup call that she needs to sort herself out because her “brand” is key in the SMP.

Not being obtuse, I'm genuinely curious and I think I asked in IRC so it'll be good to have your thoughts here as well. Seriously, whether in theory or in practice, if you are a 'slut' or if you behave and thus are perceived as such, what is the difference?

I ask this because I think it lends itself to this point: when determining a woman's rmv, or quality as a potential wife or mother, I think a woman's ncount has virtually little to nothing to do with it and her behavior in public around men has more to do with it. Men want to know how you would act if with THEM. Not how you acted with another man. 

Which scenario would you say makes a woman a slut?

A) A young woman who has a very low-ncount goes to the club, dresses and acts like she's totally available. She flirts with all the hot single men she sees. She pretends she's game to get physical. Men want to sleep with her, but based on her behavior, will not want to date her because she's behaving slutty. Her potential RMV to most of those men has decreased. 

B) A young woman secures commitment from a man who is her agemate. She is yielding and good to him. Loyal. Never cheated. They date for 3 years and then she discloses she's previously slept with 15 men. Her bf is disgusted that she has a high n-count but appreciates how she behaves now that she's with him. Her RMV has proven to be high. 

To be clear, men can evaluate potential wives with any metric they want. I don't care. But I disagree with Dalrock saying that a slut is someone who ""...destroy[s] their own ability to be trusted as a wife and mother."" There are plenty of promiscuous women with excellent RMVs and make amazing wives and/or mothers. Men can use what they perceive as sluthood as a vetting tool and that's fine but i don't think your past sexual history has any inherent effect on your ability to be a spouse or parent.",1470009677

"GreenBayPackers","t5_2qqd2","All of your assumptions are reasonable, but I think you've made a few errors in judgement. I'll do my best to lay them out for you:

1.) Jarrett Bush was not just a great Special Teamer, he was the ST captain for some time. Special teams plays involve a ton of different personnel groupings, different responsibilities that players don't practice all that much, and guys rotating in and out with some frequency. Having a player there year in and year out to make sure everything runs smoothly is arguably more valuable than Bush's actual contributions on the field. Janis has not, to this point, shown any sort of leadership ability. This is not to devalue what Janis has done on ST, just to show that comparing them apples to apples is probably unfair to what Bush meant to the team.

2.) Precedent is important, but it's not the only consideration. Yes, we kept Bush for ST, but that isn't a guarantee we keep Janis for the same. If we had a CB who we felt could seriously help the team you can be damn sure that dumping Bush would have been an option. Comparing Abby to the CBs we cut those years is what's important. If Abby can seriously help, that's a consideration that matters.

3.) I think you're seriously underselling Abby. His production in our offense, while minimal, already surpassed Janis's. He shows a clear ability to run crisp routes and find holes in zones. Despite missing almost the entirety of both training camps so far, he pretty clearly has a far better grasp of our offense and far better rapport with Rodgers than Janis. You're writing off a guy who has yet to have a healthy training camp to prove himself and improve. I think that's a bit premature, don't you? 

Outside of health, the only real knock on Abby's play is that he's dropped a few balls that were right in his breadbasket. Given how common that is for rookies and how good his hands were at Wisconsin, I think it's fair to give him the benefit of the doubt there.

I know there's a tendency to think that everyone just wants Abby to succeed because he's from Wisconsin, but that's really selling him short. Guys with his skill set, work ethic, and intelligence are valuable in this league. 

My personal feeling is that, if he stays healthy, Abby will prove himself too valuable to cut. Whether that means cutting Janis or keeping 7 WR, I do not know. Unfortunately, it seems there's a good chance we don't have to worry about this. If Ty starts the season on short-term IR, we probably don't have to choose, at least not for some time.",1470009679

And where exactly did i claim everyone loves ebay? or that its even a reflection on ebays reputation? Personally my opinion of ebay isnt great, i dont use it. Its a comparison on function, it allows people to sell goods straight to other people, the goods in this case being game keys, hence why i've stated, 'game keys' as the product they specialise in.

&gt;I don't even know how to react to this. I tell you that you're strawmanning me by saying that I think every key on G2A is stolen, and you respond with ""It's just as bad to assume every key is stolen!""

Sure, i'll admit its a strawman although not one i realised when putting it out. To elaborate more, keys can come from other sources such as bulk buying from other suppliers/publishers involved in a game being sold/distributed, from other regions, even just excess keys left over from other promotions. 

&gt;but they aren't complaining about the tiny key reselling site that sells a few thousand keys a month?

Honestly i'd say kinguin isn't that small of a site, just for example. 

&gt;I think that if all the big streamers drop their G2A sponsorships and say ""hey don't buy from G2A"" then they will be much less successful...

Well considering thats basically G2A's primary form of marketing, yes it'd hurt it, but i think its missing the point of that people shop on G2A because its cheaper. There are other reasons ive heard too like country restrictions and payment handlers which G2A covers where as others dont too.

* git diff: 'relative to the index (staging area for the next commit)'
* git stage: 'Add file contents to the staging area. This is a synonym for git-add(1). Please refer to the documentation of that command'

these are the only occurrences of ""staging area"" in the git help pages which are collectively 29000 lines long. in every case it's used, it's noted that it's a synonym for add or index. in contrast, index is used 105 times in those same man pages. trust me, there is no staging area - it's a term that's used to try to help people that don't understand the underlying technology to get comfortable with git (your ""getting started"" document is another example in the same category)

"translator","t5_2ss9z","&gt; Every time I learn more about Kanji it makes me believe that the Japanese have the most complex modern writing system in the world.

Yes and no. Chinese uses only its own characters (after all, *kanji* means Chinese characters), and unlike Japanese, if you don't know how to write the kanji you can't substitute it with a phonetic word in writing. As as example: The word for ""grape"" in Chinese and Japanese has the characters 葡萄, which are pretty unique characters. They aren't often used separately in compounds that don't have something to do with grapes. (Which makes sense, as the word was a loanword from Persian). 

If I'm writing in Modern Japanese, however, it's perfectly okay to write the kana ブドウ or ぶどう instead of the kanji - that is, a phonetic representation. However, I *cannot* write the equivalent phonetic representation *pútáo* in Chinese if I forgot the characters (I mean, I could, but it wouldn't be appropriate or within orthographical guidelines). 

One advantage Modern Chinese with Mandarin pronunciations does have over Japanese when it comes to learning characters is that most characters have only one pronunciation. Let's take 生, for example. In Mandarin, there's just one way to pronounce it - *shēng*. But not so in Japanese.

Regarding the Elimination Chamber, the logistics and delivery of the structure were complicated, because the cage is so big and heavy you can't just put it on a plane and fly it. The only way to get the Chamber from mainland USA to PR for the PPV was via boat. Once the event was over, Dueno's production company was allegedly on the hook for the entire cost of shipping the Chamber to and from PR, and the costs were so exhorbant that Dueno reportedly ended up losing money from co-producing the show. Since then, Carlos Colon has taken over the WWE's co-production duties on the island. He's famous among vets for being a cheapskate, which is why PR house shows look so poorly produced, but I'm sure that philosophy ensures that he sees a greater profit than Dueno ever did.",1470009683

JoJo only got it's popularity because of the Anime, before then, there were no scans for a good portion of the Manga, it's not like western fans had 20+ years to catch up due to lack of proper scans. To Japan, it's 27 years old, but to the west, it might as well be 3 to 4 years old. Heck, one part of the JoJo series still has shit quality scans. Don't feel forced to read the manga.

Well obviously you and the people bitching about it do.

In the name of God. 

Good question. I would like to point you to a lecture given by Hamza Yusuf on Imam Al Ghazali addressing what happens to the non-Muslims, but I don't remember what the lecture was called, I'm sure it's somewhere on YouTube though :). From what I know, the Scholars have differences of opinion regarding this, but one is that so long as you think Islam is correct, and you reject it thinking this way, then you will be judged. If you live in a village in which nobody is Muslim, and you die without hearing the word Islam once in your life, I think the opinion of Imam Al Ghazali was that you won't be judged. I may be wrong, always good to double check.

Let's clarify once again, I am NOT a Scholar, I only remember hearing this, and and I fear that I would be judged based on what I said. Since I'm unsure, it's good to check the issue before believing it. May God forgive me if I said anything wrong. God knows best. 

Peace be with you. 

Also, don't hesitate to shoot me DMs if you have any questions on Islam. I would love to answer them anytime, as sure as I know the subreddit would too. Hope you find other helpful answers. ",1470009689

*****
&gt; Malka Older&amp;#039;s debut novel Infomocracy is a sci-fi thriller about the third election cycle in the world&amp;#039;s first global government, a data-driven &amp;quot;Microdemocracy.&amp;quot; The first in a trilogy, Infomocracy manages to be incredibly action packed while also exploring plausible political futures you may never have imagined.

&gt; Older, who has served as a humanitarian worker in nations all over the world, offers us a portrait of truly global culture that is neither a dystopia nor a utopia, but feels lived-in, complex, and believable.

&gt; Anti-authoritarian radicals who think the global democracy is a sham try to undermine the public&amp;#039;s confidence in The Information&amp;#039;s ability to run a fair election.

I totally understand where your coming from and i said this a LOT back when ingress was new. The problem is this isn't there first time though, for the engineers the devs or any of them. For us who played ingress we know their track record and this is literally par for the course and that's what upsets a lot of us. They haven't gotten better in years. After a point there is no excuse for lack of communication, this isn't about suddenly tiny company has a big game on their hands. It is a matter of a tiny company who knows it has problems has been told for YEARS about them by its community. Knows it has one of the biggest IP's in history on its hands with a multi-million preinstalled player base and didn't get any form of PR up front ready to handle the shit show. 

Engineers, devs, artists all of them are equally at fault at this point. It is a small team meaning they all work close together. Their should be no problem with engineers telling the PR to cover for em. If there is a problem doing that then the entire company is crap and deserves what it has coming to em, that's just the nature of the world.

I notice that when people use a specific word repeatedly and stretch the context (psychotic trip, pleasant psychosis, state of psychosis, psychotic symptoms), it's the next thing they're being programmed to believe about themselves and therefore fall to.

Magic Mountain - Justice League - remove VR from Revolution

Great Adventure - Justice League and STOP VR from going to Nitro

Great America - Stop VR from going to Raging Bull. Retrack American Eagle and put a backwards train back on. (if not already, it seems to be off and on)

Over Texas - Remove VR. Add small but well themed B&amp;M Dive. I'm thinking Baron 1895 style

Over Georgia - Justice League

Fiesta Texas - More water park stuff

New England - Burn it down. The park is garbage and can't be saved. Seriously, this park is just horrible. So.. give it nothing, so that maybe there will be less people so it will be slightly more enjoyable?

St. Louis - Something to Boss. Either RMC it or if they don't come up with anything great, then I guess go with GCI

Discovery Kingdom - general improvement, stop any thoughts of VR on anything. 

America - I really believe that this park could do very well. So I propose the first step. Wait for it..... A well themed Intamin Aquatrax in an area to complete the park to make a circle.

Great Escape - Restore the old feel of the park, remove Steamin'n Demon as the start of a custom B&amp;M Flyer that interacts with log flume theming.

Mexico- Not much, maybe a flat ride or two

La Ronde - Connect the paths, but do something so it can be closed early for the fireworks shows.  Get new trains for the boomerang",1470009695

"Dodgers","t5_2ra0i","I mean, he did just hit a 3-run home run to ice the game for us, that was his 3rd error of the year, which is pretty solid, getting Lucroy would kill our farm, which is a bad idea. Look at the Blue Jays and Rangers last year, they went out and got ace pitchers, made the playoffs and did the exact same shit we did, going and getting big names doesn't mean anything, look at the Padres offseason last year, people thought they were a legit threat and they turned out shitty, the only team in the last 10 years that has won the World Series by getting a bunch of big name free agents was the Yankees, everyone else has won it through drafting an developing good players, so giving Urias+ for a rental Lucroy (considering he wanted to get rid of his team option for 2017) is not a good idea. Plus, Yaz is either 2nd or 3rd on the team in HR and is like 5th in RBI, his BA is low but his OBP is like .310 or higher, which is very good for a catcher, he has the best exit velocity of anyone on the team which means he's hitting the ball hard, but he's getting a little bit unlucky, so Grandal does add value to this team. And pitch framing can help a pitcher get out of a tight spot, Goldschmidt is up with a man in RISP and 2 outs, and it's a 3-2 count, making a ball look like a strike is a huge deal, pitchers maybe don't comment on it because it's hard to notice, but they no it's there, if you got your head out of your ass maybe you'd see it too",1470009695

~~Mr. Mime~~
~~Lapras~~
~~Omanyte~~
~~Kabuto~~
~~Aerodactyl~~
~~Snorlax~~

*edit* The striked out portion isn't much of the focus here. We know what of these comes from what eggs. And remember. You are one of many millions playing this game. The odds of one of you here having a pokemon the bot didn't hatch is high.

So according to this you *have* to find a nest to ever have a dream of getting a beloved charizard, blastoise, or venasaur.

Of the starter pokemon only charmander seems to have a nest in my area. (Though it's still 20 minutes away.) The rest seem to just be pure luck. I'm level 23 and have caught 1 of the three starters each and just a few pikachu. Hell I've got more Lapras than  all of the starter pokemon combined.

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","Ok, so I have wet plugs after cranking for a while. I'm running an in tank electric fuel pump with a regulator and gauge to 6 psi. The truck sat over the winter in my heated garage, I started wrenching on it just early spring. I have 91 pump gas, no ethanol fuel. The brake booster I had disconnected until today as I was being optimistic and thought ""if it's going to fire I want everything to be connected so there's no question."" I don't have a pcv valve, just a vent off the rocker cover kind of thing. I haven't tried to retorque the intake manifold yet, I originally torqued it to 30 lbs ft as per the blower install instruction. I have no egr. With regards to the raw fuel, I haven't sprayed any into the carb or poured, just used the accelerator pump squirter to dump fuel to it. The cam gears, now I installed the cam myself and I made sure everything was timed and lined up. I've had this engine for 4 or 5 years now. I was running it last summer with a flat tappet cam and a dual plane intake with a 700 double pumper and it ran pretty well then. It wasn't a bear to tune or anything like it is now. As for the blower and carbs I have now, they are all brand new. Everything came in sealed boxes, no remanufactured parts or anything like that.  I should check the power valves like you say, they could've gone NFG from one of the many backfires.  Now here's a theory, whenever I get a backfire while cranking it sounds like the carbs are the having air pushed out of them the opposite direction until I stop cranking, wait 30 seconds or so then start cranking again and its back to normal airflow, this makes no sense to me. Unless I have an issue with a valve and it's sticking open just for a second.  After installing the cam I made sure the engine turned over and there was no piston to valve contact. Maybe there was just enough contact to snag a valve and give it a bit of a bend? Or, maybe I have a bent pushrod from not adjusting the lifter preload correctly? Hydraulic roller tappets with 3/4 turn from zero lash, maybe too much and it's bottoming out on the lifter? Now thinking worse case scenario here, maybe I have no compression? Maybe there's a Crack somewhere in the head or the block or both?  I'm praying it's not that.  Maybe there's a manufacturer defect? Tough to prove after backfiring the damn thing more times than I can count.

Thanks again for your help and advice, I appreciate it all!",1470009702

 - using the right lane to overtake is ok. 
 - if you are in the right lane and are travelling faster than the cars in the left lane then it should be assumed you are overtaking.
 - once you have passed the cars in the left lane, move back to the left lane to free up the right lane.

 - If you are behind a car in the right lane that appears to be overtaking, at least give them a chance to finish that when they can ie moving back to the left lane
 - tailgating and flashing your high beams just because you want the car in front to drive faster than the speed limit is wrong so stop being an aggressive rude cunt
 - tailgating/flashing your high beams when the car in front of you has been camped in the right lane completely oblivious to the traffic around them is ok because they're ignorant tools.

 - even though no one wants to ""give in"" to an aggressive rude cunt, its best to do so when safe.",1470009703

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; Just another ploy to get us to support another us president before we get fucked (like the last 10 presidents)?
&gt; Or do you think Donald has an agenda to play out? But I would imagine it will be no different than hillary.

In the last little while I've noticed some really odd connections. The hardest thing for me to accept was the seemingly anti-Zionist category HRC gets placed in [by actual evidence not popular myth]. We all see stuff posted on conspiracy sites, ""HRC is a Zionist shill"" Actually read those articles, they are pretty weak. I think Zionist policy and AIPAC, is so powerful that *anyone* that becomes POTUS is going to end up doing some bidding of Israel.

None of this is even mainstream contentious, [just as a book citing totally mainstream sources drew the same conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy) and of course the writer was immediately attacked.

&gt;(AIPAC) in particular has a ""stranglehold on the U.S. Congress"", due to its ""ability to reward legislators and congressional candidates who support its agenda, and to punish those who challenge it.""

If you check her emails, literally half of them are msgs from Sid Blumenthal-a guy who gets called an 'anti-semite' or 'self hating Jew' and his son gets called even worse. (Son compared Israel to Nazi Germany and Mossad to SS)

So... 

The problem I have is that Trump is obviously shilling for Zionism. He's out declaring Muslims an immediate threat to the nation, also erroneously stating Muslim's were singing and dancing when the Twin Towers fell. [Sorry, but those were **Mossad agents**.](http://yournewswire.com/fbi-report-on-dancing-israelis-proves-mossad-knew-about-911-in-advance/)

When Bush was in power we saw a crazy advancement re:policy in the Middle East. Also reshaping us into a world of 'terror'. With the number of False Flags Mossad engages in, the benefit to they've got out of the 'terror' worldview, it's hard to ignore their influence in US policy.

Does it even matter? Well, I tend to agree that there are power brokers well above talking heads, so in either case, the power brokers plans are going to be pushed through. This will happen no matter who's in office. The two party system is broken. 

It does appear there are ramifications with varying influences though. It's like if you have a family of 20 ppl, the Mom &amp; Dad always have the final say, but the kids will change certain things along the way. That's what I assume politics boils down to. The power brokers are Mom&amp;Dad, (Im guessing they are certain bloodlines and dynasties who are the power brokers), they likely make much membership in CFR, Bilderberg, Jesuits, Vatican &amp; other secret societies. Though some say there's a split between them, and current infighting. Who's who, idk.) 

The fact HRC is getting decimated publicly and has had so many 'leaks' and 'hacks' and the extreme length of Benghazi has me mystified. I'm still waiting for anyone to put forward a plausible explanation.  Is it possible it's actually just to keep people distracted? I *guess* but not really, doesn't really explain it. If someone is supposedly as corrupt as her, why is she getting smashed so badly? It's a breakdown of logic. In '07-08' there were emails showing bankers were complicit in the Subprime crisis, there was evidence everyone involved was guilty, but they all walked. Not a single person in jail. And HRCs situation, I can see people drawing comparisons, as she walks from the email scandal, but keep in mind her political position has been severely damaged. And there was no reason for 'hacks' and 'leaks' to happen. We only know about subprime because the world went broke overnight when the house of cards fell, and even then the true culprits weren't even fully ID'd. Zero arrests. Not even a face to the crime.

When Trump first announced I thought it was because HRC couldn't get elected without a complete fool to make her look good, and that he was a plant. Turns out he was actually serious, holy shit. He now appears to be the establishment pick IMO. Or at least the Zionist pick. It's clear the people behind him are lightyears ahead of her in the online world. She may have media-TV ignoring her controversies but I think its actually damaging to her with how much exposure they get online. To be frank I don't think she's the actual pick so Im not even sure she can get in office. 

It'd be awesome if people could actually know the real story behind the scenes. It's possible there might even be ""good"" and ""bad"" guys. But people are plebs and plebs are in the dark. My advice is don't vote. *For anyone.* Maybe when enough people stop voting it will remind them of what happens when your slaves stop caring about your authority.",1470009706

"lrcast","t5_330dh","I watched this draft live and I watched the matches which were on camera.  Fun games to watch.

It was about as bad of a draft as I have seen, and the drafter indicated in an interview during the event that it was pretty much a train wreck draft.

The reason he won, in my view, is that he played meaningful spells on curve bigtime (one drop into two drop into three drop into four drop one game, 2 into 3 into 4 in some other games) while his opponents often had no early plays or plays which had no effect on the board (such as the 2/1 flyer which can't block non-flyers).  Had they drawn their usual amount of removal or bounce spells, or even decent blockers, they would have been fine, but their draws were mostly terrible.

I guess it reinforces what many pros say which is that if they can't get a deck with power then just get a quick low-to-the-ground deck and punish opponents who stumble.  There was plenty of stumbling in these matches.

With that said, I do not think this is a learning experience for us average players.  Forcing something like this, and bypassing ""bombs in other colors"" (as the drafter stated in interviews that he did) is not in my view a good way to win games.  It can win, but it takes a lot of stumbling by opponents.",1470009707

He likes to cook for people so he opened a restaurant.  But in a society where no one needs cash and you do what you want, who would choose to be a waiter?  Why does anyone make dinner with a replicator at home, when they can go to a nice restaurant, which presumably doesn't charge?  I also assume the Federation crew members on DS9 were getting some kind of stipend or how would they drink at Quark's or the Klingon restaurant?

I agree with other commenters that being productive is not a requirement in the Federation.  They seem to have created a culture and education system that generally produces people with aspirations, who want to better themselves and their society.  It's a very optimistic view of our future, but one that seems plausible to me.  That's kind of the whole point of the show.",1470009708

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Typically, a good dungeon party is 2 DPS, a healer, and a tank. For three people just running around having fun, you'll be able to get by with just 2 damage-dealers and a healer, or 2 DPS and a tank. Or 3 DPS. Really doesn't matter much unless you're doing dungeons. Just don't all be tanks, because it's pretty hard to do anything as just a tank if you haven't got a damage-dealer there too.

Expecting the next question to be what class would be ideal for each, I'll say this:

Any class can fill any role. Templars tend to be better at healing than the other classes because they've got a whole skill tree dedicated to it. Dragonknights tend to be good tanks, because they've got a whole skill tree that's pretty much full of tanking skills.

But you don't have to stick to that. You can have sorcerers as tanks, nightblades as healers, whatever. Pick a class, experiment around a bit in the tutorial and afterwards, and see if you like how it feels. It helps to know early what it is you want to do so you can get everything sorted out and get a feel for how that would play. That said, if you like the class but you don't like what you're doing with it, you can always spend a little in-game money to reset your skill point and attribute point investments, and put them somewhere else.",1470009710

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Pros: Learning what you want out of a relationship.  I view this as nearly a necessity nowadays, too many of my friends are only just learning how shitty their partners are, or how badly they fit.  Literally a marriage died today, and we called it two years ago, the girl had only ever had two boyfriends, and was obviously not realizing what it takes for a healthy relationships to work.

Cons: Can get a little sleazy.  I don't like 'hookup' culture, as that's really just teaching how to fuck.  It's much more important to learn how to manage relationships, and that comes from dating/socializing more than fucking.  

Anyway, those are my two cents.  I balanced well enough, I think I overreacted a lot, thought many women were much more impactful in my life than they are, and definitely settled for too much of a bad thing.

2. The cooler and sometimes the more expensive models have a custom PCB for better power delivery. It is basically a matter of looks and cooling performance. GTX 970's all run fairly cooler so get something cheap. Paying over $240 for one is silly.

3. Check out my parts list below for a much faster parts list that costs less money. Hybrid cooled GTX 970 for $250 is a steal.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I brought debt into my marriage as well (about $70k from undergrad) whereas he had no undergrad debt and did dental school with an Army scholarship. He knew about it all obviously, and we've worked out a pretty aggressive payoff plan that is actually pretty close to being completed. (We did not make any joint payments until we were married, but we lived together for three years, during which I made payments and my mom helped me a little). 

I graduated undergrad in 2011. We got married in 2014 when he graduated dental school and was commissioned in the Army. USAA offered a ""new officer"" loan of $25k that we took to pay off a large chunk of my private loans (they were at ~7.75% and the new officer loan is at 2.99%). Other than that, we've been saving and working to pay off the loans as quickly as possible. Only that new officer loan plus my federal loans left to go, and those should be paid off by the fall. 

I guess it just really depends on your view of finances. Some couples don't combine finances, so I imagine that if one half of a couple like that has debt, then they pay it off on their own. Some only combine for some things. My husband and I combined everything—both incomes go to one joint account, out of which we each get an ""allowance"" monthly in our respective personal checking accounts. I'm lucky in that he knew about my debt and was willing to help pay it off. Obviously you seem to be the same way. With a debt so large, it might be worth looking into consolidating it if at all possible to potentially get a lower interest rate. 

I agree with /u/anothertokengirl that you need to make sure the two of you are on the same page about this stuff and make a plan together. But it seems like you're definitely on the right track, at least in the sense that you're already thinking about this stuff. Best of luck :)",1470009718

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","I agree that it wouldnt make any sense to try to beef up quickplay to something *it wasnt intended to be*. Any sort of the proposed changes would severely limit or piss off a great deal of casual players...its a casual mode, let it be.

I agree with OP's argument that yes, DPS requires more mechanical skill...but I dont agree with:

&gt;It makes no sense a player who is playing support for most of their matches should climb at the same rate as a player who is playing dps in most of their matches. 

It does make sense, if the support player is consistently contributing to victories...The metric used for this though? thats the big questions mark. 

&gt;Please understand that I am not saying people who enjoy supports be shafted. I am arguing that people who enjoy supports can play them, but expecting to receive the same amount of reward as a player who is in a much more critical position is a little iffy.

Which is effectively giving support players a giant shaft up the ass...

Interesting that OP brings up Zenyatta and Lucio though as possible characters that rank up as fast as DPS...I could possibly see Zenyatta (a really fucking good one), but not sure about Lucio. It would be EXTREMELY interesting to see somebody pull data from the top 500 charts, and divide people's mains up to see which classes of heroes make up the majority.

edit: just a quick glance at the top 50 players on PC...only about 5-6 players regularly main support.

3. In the USA it is illegal to take the life of a human being - a blob of tissue.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Marcus had already been chosen well before the death of Antoninus.  Many believe Hadrian selected Antininus specifically because he would likely die in a decade or so, allowing his already arranged heirs Marcus and Lucsious, who would then be in there mid-30s.  However, Antininus lived an extra decade Hadrian had not counted on, so, Marcus and Luscious ascended later than they was likely intended.     

Antininus, to many reigned over a Golden Age, but I think it was more a Gilded Age.  The Golden Age was more under Trajan and Hadrian.  While things were peaceful under Antininus, the legions became soft and the foriegn policy of the empire transitioned more toward patronage than conquest.  Meaning, a lot of external threats were payed off, rather than fought off, which created a long term view that the empire was exploitable, which, honestly, it was depending on who would rule going forward.    

Many of the problems faced during the reign of his successors, Marcus and Luscious, was a direct result of the weakened posture of the empire under Antininus.  If Antininus had been a more militant ruler, it is likely the coming wars in Germania would have been unnecessary.    

Further, perhaps the largest result of the surge in military, especially  defensive, engagements, is the exposure to the troops, and eventually the population back home, of the Antinine Plague (likely small pox).  This plague, more than the misrule of Comodus, really lead to the beginning of the end as it sapped the economic and military strength of the whole empire just when it needed it most.",1470009725

Lincoln would have had to either bend to the Radical plans, or even more likely, faced impeachment like Johnson did. And there was plenty of war time ammunition to impeach Lincoln, even if it likely would have destroyed the radical's in the next election or the one following.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","This is JK Rowling's creation. It's all she had when she had nothing. She knows this world and its characters better than any of us ever will. JK is one of the most genuine, kindest and most respectful authors-nay, celebrities in the world today. She crafts everything from a place of love and from her own experiences. This play is clearly born from Rowling's struggles being a parent to three children, similar to Harry, and the struggles her children face growing up in the shadow of such a successful and famous parent, similar to Albus. I'd say this is Rowling's most personal Potter story to date. Every scene between Harry and Albus was clearly written from experience. It reminded me of my own teenage years, struggling to prove myself to my parents and feeling like the ""loser"" child. The argument Harry and Albus had echoed many arguments I had with my own parents. It hammered home again that Harry isn't an infallible hero. He's a normal person. And he's going to struggle with the things everyone else does. 

To say Rowling is treating Harry Potter and it's fans with contempt is wrong. Simply put. You're allowed to dislike Cursed Child, but to act like you know better than the woman who created this world, lived in it for over 20 years now and that you know how the characters she created (the characters that she sees as some of her own children I might add) should act and she doesn't is wrong. I hate this attitude of ""we fans know better"". We don't. We know horseshit. I may not like Attack of the Clones as a film, but I'm not going to say I know better than George Lucas and know how the story and characters should be. I just didn't enjoy that particular instalment. I'm not going to say he was treating the fans with contempt, he was just trying to tell a story he wanted to tell. Saying Rowling is treating Harry Potter with contempt is akin to telling Tolkien he's treating his fans with contempt for adding backstory to Sauron, Gandalf and others via The Silmarillion. It's pointless. This is Rowling's story and creation. You're allowed to not like it, but by god you're not allowed to be rude to her or to the people who put hard work and effort into this play. 

You're allowed to dislike it. Yes. But to spout such hatred to an author and saying she's ""shat"" on you and treating you with contempt for daring to write a story you didn't like is pointless, silly and quite frankly childish. ",1470009728

I did respond! The solar system is super relevant! It explains everything. I actually don't know how to explain it better. Everyone agrees on free will and moral responsibility except perhaps Harris who is deeply confused and who doesn't hold a consistent set of views in any case. So moral responsibility is like the solar system. People disagree about whether free will is lib

&gt;yes, i said that geocentrism is indeed like libertarian free will. if only you had read what you quoted a little more closely....

What did I miss?

&gt;https://askaphilosopher.wordpress.com/2014/07/31/is-there-free-will/- heres massimo saying it.

He **VERY EXPLICITLY** does not say that free will historically has been understood in the libertarian sense. Here is what he **LITERALLY SAYS**:

&gt;classically there are three fundamental ways to think about free will/ volition from a philosophical perspective: compatibilism, deterministic incompatibilism, and libertarian incompatibilism.

That means there are THREE WAYS to understand free will, not ONE, historically.

&gt; owen says it here at 1:08- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ob4c_iLuTw

Good! Notice though that he's arguing for it, not simply assuming it, like Harris does.

&gt;but you wouldn't deny the causal story i sketched out right? in any given moment, our thoughts and actions are all the result of antecedent causes (with a little randomness thrown in perhaps). we couldnt have done otherwise in any given moment, as they say 

A compatibilist would not deny this.

&gt;also, can i ask where this revulsion to anything sam harris comes from, from you?

Mine is considerably shorter: Since critique on the writing was what you requested, it was all solid enough (at or beyond the point where fixes to it probably wouldn't improve the quality of the response, and might get into matters of personal opinion) except for the opening two paragraphs. I can appreciate the desire to ease into what her *real* profession is and not just come out and swing it around like a sledgehammer, but I read the first half of the opening paragraph three times before I got it - I really was confused as to how her employer was a client, and how he worked for him day and night. How much does her having a job during the day inform your vision of the character? Does she need it? Maybe leave it out, or make her day job past tense to help distinguish it?

I can't say that I still get this line, ""She did not just play house with him,"" at all. 

After the hiccups at the beginning, it flowed, and it was enjoyable enough that I'd want to keep reading it even if it wasn't for DPPT, but I do feel like I got more of a sense of her social environment than the character herself. It feels like I know the circles she moves in - like I might have heard about her through a friend - rather than knowing her directly. That may be intentional, and may actually help to drive an interesting aspect of the setup, but it does leave a vacuum that would make me second-guess whether or not it's worth sending in a message; I'd assume I'd be one of the people who had missed the point and not gotten that connection that spurs a really worthwhile response.

"CampingandHiking","t5_2qqom","As both a backpacker and a mountain biker I can see how bicycles would be cause for concern. 

For one I know it's a fact that bikes cause far more damage to trails than hikers (but it's my opinion that pack animals are probably worse than bikes for trails). Also as far as wilderness trails go most just are not good for bikes because they never were built with them in mind. For example lots of stairs on hill climbs, hairpin turns on sheer cliffs, narrow catwalks on hillsides. Add to these environmental hazards the danger of two way traffic on narrow single track. I think many existing trails from management, practicality, and safety standpoints are just not good ideas. I'm sure park management can find a way to make it work, possibly by constructing new bike friendly trails so not to say it's impossible to make it work, but it's just not as simple as letting the bikes have free range. 

Also I know the dangers involved with wilderness travel are part of the experience, but adding a bike to the mix is only going to make more emergency situations for SAR teams. Sure hikers get injured or stranded but I can only see this amplifying the situation. With the increased speed on a bike comes higher risk of injury. Also equipment malfunction is a more serious problem because what might've been a three day journey on a bike is now a week's hike out. 

Lastly I think the chance for more destruction of the environment is higher with bikers perhaps modifying trails, building jumps or tracks, and abandoning broken gear. 

In all I think mountain bikers could be added to in wilderness areas but it'd take some careful thought on how to make it safe and sustainable.

What if I can't change character.

I can't even get rid of trying to catch people with 2S, despite said 2S being nerfed 4 times since AC to total uselessness. There is no changing characters for me, it seems. I will live as an AC Slayer for the rest of my pathetic life and die as one.

This, however, has nothing to do with the fact that Xrd Slayer has broke the bottom of the barrel and is approaching lithosphere with a record-breaking speed of 11 nerfs per year. What we got in 1.03 patch notes is plain mockery, and given how excruciatingly long the history of #nerfslayer is (it broke a decade some time ago), fall patch will probably end the same.

"danganronpa","t5_2wcd0","What if Mitarai is the same person in both arcs? Right now, we're just assuming that the Mitarai in the Despair arc is the Imposter.

I want to point out that in DR2, the game seemed to start off with the characters meeting each other for the first time, and at the time, the Imposter had already assumed the identity of Togami. Why isn't he Togami in the Despair Arc? 

Going by that logic, when class 77 first started, 'Togami' should have been part of the class, but instead, we have 'Mitarai'. It's possible that he decided to 'resign' as Togami and 'transfer' into the class as Matarai, but that seems strange. Near the start of the Future Arc, we get glimpses of the DR2 cast in their despair states and you can see that the Imposter is back in his Togami identity. If we're truly assuming that it's still the Imposter, why did he go from Togami to Mitarai and back to Togami?

If Mitarai is the same person in both arcs, it might suggest that the Imposter really did drop out and was replaced with the real Mitarai, or for some reason, the Imposter was never actually part of the class and Mitarai has been there since the beginning. In that case, why did the Imposter affiliate themselves with class 77 who later became the Remants of Despair?",1470009734

Far from the truth, but do go on!      
      

&gt;Smart Axis teams will always banzai from multiple directions.                
                              
The same is true for smart Allied teams approaching an objective. 
            

&gt;All of this doesn't apply to mortars where you sit at an ammo box aiming 20 meters behind the enemy point and get 30+ kills per game with no risks involved.         
           
Correct, it *doesn't* apply because they are not *comparable* weapons. They fill different roles and are useful for different situations.    
Also, in many maps there is a long cooldown for refilling your ammo after the 1st time you do it; and while you can rack up kills with a mortar with no risk involved, you will rack up *more* with the flamethrower if you know what you're doing - which also brings me to my next point - there is a very easy way to protect yourself from mortars: be under a roof. More-so, if you plan your approach properly, there is a good chance the enemy mortars won't be firing anywhere near you at all. Which is another area in which mortars and flamers are *incomparable*, since mortars involve a lot of guessing work / relying on recon / relying on your team to point targets to you / relying on the enemy to pick the most obvious route into a given objective. With a flamethrower, the guessing work consists of a single burst of flame through a window or into a hedge; no one there? no worries, you still have a whole *fuel tank* left. With the mortar, you get 6 shots, and then you may have to wait a minute or two before you get to try again.     
I really don't get why this offends you so much to the point that you'd step as low as ad hominems accusing me of being a ""weeabo"" simply because I disagree with your extremely superficial view on a very asymmetric game.

In terms of strength for the whole lot of them obviously right now the Beast is number 1. Alaric I think could have been a little less than the Beast in raw power as he never manhandled Klaus in the same fashion but was still impossible to put down. 

Then Mikael, regardless of how strong Klaus was he only ever truly beat Mikael when he was hurt from wolf venom, and then klaus. Elijah, Finn, Rebekah, and Kol.

"opiates","t5_2r0y3","Mod limits, or at least mod reviews: I think that this is important, if only to hold the mods accountable to the sub. We do have a responsibility here, both in threads and behind the scenes, and it would be great to get feedback about how we're doing from the members, and what we could be doing better. This is something that the mods could do internally also but then we wouldn't get your feedback. The problem with this, though, is that some mods may be more disliked than others simply because they are the ones who are visibly enforcing the rules, whereas there is no reason to have issues with a mod who  acts behind the scenes or not at all.  

The insults and sniping with one another and name calling and personal attacks: these spread a toxic vibe and no one wants to be reading pages of people calling each other retards and fuck bois and insulting them like we were in grade school. It gets in the way of serious conversation. I don't want to censor people, but at the same time if a comment thread is just two people fighting with each other with out anything constructive being added, I don't see why we should all be subject to it. I think it should be removed. 

Frequently asked questions regarding PST and suboxone dosage timing: maybe compile a bunch of posts into one thread that can be linked to when people ask these questions? The questions do have to do with opiates but the information is all here already.

It wasn't so much your actual understanding of the game that was flawed anyway, just a few errors on how some stuff works, and everyone makes those mistakes (I, for example, still don't know how to play as Zarya for the life of me, which is annoying since I see so many of them totally carry a team).

D.Va can tank - the update to her DM is the biggest factor that has made that possible - but I still wouldn't recommend her as a main tank. Tanking often means long sight lines, and that means you either want good damage protection (Reinhardt) or the ability to do good damage at range (Roadhog). D.Va has neither, but she has got something that they don't, which is mobility. That boost makes puts her in the top three most mobile heroes in the game if you ask me, along with Tracer and Genji (as she is much better at escaping a conflict than Pharah). To not utilise that is, frankly, criminal. Your ability to get in or out of any situation you wish is invaluable, and the low cooldown means you can usually do it just when you want to. Even if you fuck up, if you're fortunate you'll only come up against projectile-users, so a full, 4-second DM leaves you with only one second until your boosters are back. Make no mistake, D.Va would be complete garbage without the boosters, so make damn good use of them to flank when someone else is tanking!",1470009738

We knew what it was. There had been rumors, but a few of us had actually met them. I had met them more than a few times; the COFE, or Caretakers Of Fictional Entities. A hegemonic institution with interdimensional technology far beyond anything this world has ever dreamed of. They said throughout the multiverse we're known as a genocidal, dangerous race. Every time we told a story...it became real. The human imagination resonated on such a deep, universal level it affected the balance of creation, weighing it down with all of our fears and hopes, from the shortest campfire tale to the juggernaughts of literary history. 

And I just found out how to keep those psychotic bastards away from me. Forever. Which is fortunate, when you have a brigade banging on your front door. 

""OPEN THE DOOR AND PLACE YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD"" The banging was urgent. Apparently they figured out my weapon, their curse.

""Make me, fuckface."" Not the smartest reply, but I was feeling cocky. 

""Last warning!"" 

""Suck my dick.""

The door shattered inward with much more force than I was expecting. Hitting the wall didn't hurt so much as landing straight on my balls. The blinding pain and immediate nausea made me regret not finishing them off immediately. They flooded the room, leveling their Transports at me. One nervous nelly and I'd have a portion of me sent to The Void, never to return. 

""You will place your hands on your head and lie down on the floor."" The big guy looked serious. Although, it was the Transport aimed squarely at my face that really sold it; he was just taking the credit. 

I placed my hands on my head, squarely over my mouth. I waited for them to remove my bruised nuts and banish them to eternity for not strictly following their orders (for the protectors of fictional entities, they sure are literal). They didn't move...

Then I had them.

I've found that if you would be working out 3x per week then it is better to do full body workouts rather than doing brosplits. Brosplits aren't exactly bad but it is inefficient. If you would be doing brosplits you should do a routine of it 2x per week so you hit a bodypart twice. But I also think that it isn't necessary to do a strength program if your goals are purely aesthetic which is what brosplits are for. 

Right now I'm doing an Upper/Lower program which hits everything twice a week and is a 4 day program called Lyle's Generic Bulking program.

Most people always say that you should start with a strength program but doesn't have to be the case if your goals are purely aesthetic. Not saying Strength Programs aren't great, just maybe not what suits your needs.",1470009740

In the traditional Sunni Islam of the people, which used to be dominated by Sufism, worshippers would visit the graves of the ʾawliya.  They'd pray there.  They'd hold feasts ([*mawlid*](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-05/21/c_133349443_11.htm); birthdays applied to the Prophet Muhammad and various saints) nearby, in commemoration of the Prophet or wali's birth, with food, processions and gifts.

All that is ending, however, as Saudi Arabian puritanism is sweeping the Muslim world thanks to their money, religious schools and prestige.

I've also recently set up passthrough. I have a GTX 670, and native got 70+ fps with everything set to High (vsync off). Now, I need to set everything to medium to get the same performance (honestly though I can't tell the difference).

I've given my VM 3 out of 4 cores, non-hyperthreaded. If I give it 4, it causes the VM to skip a beat every 5-15 seconds, causing stutter most noticeable when playing a game. It affects the sound too, so it's not just graphical.

The disk is VirtIO, and I'm pinning the 3 cores in the VM. I'm not sure what else to do, but I would have expected a bit more performance, since I was lead to believe you only lose 2-3%.",1470009744

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Not really.  I think BR is both an antagonist to the Others and an antagonist to what's best for humanity.  He's the guy who's using terrible and self-destructive tactics while believing he's fighting the necessary war to preserve Westeros's security.  He's the CIA supporting Pinochet, Rumsfield gladhanding Saddam, or MacNamara guiding Johnson to fight the Vietnam War.  Those guys were all facing the threat of Communism (which had declared that it wanted to *eliminate* capitalism everywhere) but their strategy and tactics were self-destructive to their goals, not least of which because they empowered monsters.  

A Saruman/Sauron analogy is meaningless.  BR &amp; probably Euron are convinced they are the good guys taking the necessary acts to stop the Others.  I personally don't think there is any alliance between any humans and the Others (except for the occasional quisling like Crastor which is more of a give us your babies and we won't slaughter you, cattle), no more than people are allied with the plague, a planet killing asteroid, or climate change.  But people can become so distracted on fighting each other that they fail to deal with the existential threat, even those that claim they are concerned about the existential threat.  ",1470009744

**General**

- When the flavor text is a quote from a character that appears on the card, it's usually between "".

- I REALLY like the livestock tribal subtheme :D

**Commons**

- Unspoiled Wilderness should DEFINITELY scry. Just look at the price of [[Horizon Canopy]] and you'll understand that your card sadly can't exist.

- The overall quality of those commons looks really good. Great job!

**Uncommons**

- Big-Tent Trickster could also hit creatures and be completely fine as an uncommon. It looks more like a common as-is.

- I think Expel could still be fine at 1U as a good uncommon counterspell.

- Cleaner wording for Chupacabra: ""Sacrifice a creature: Chupacabra gets +2/+2 until end of turn. If that creature was a Goat, Sheep, Horse, Ox or Boar, put two +1/+1 counters on Chupacabra instead.""

- Lawmage Deputy: Do you want this to be uncommon even considering [[Heliod's Pilgrim]]? If so, I think it could cost UW!

- Spellcatter Sharpshooter: I'd change that to ""Remove a charge counter from an artifact you control"" to make it fit better in other sets. As is it's very narrow... maybe it's just me.

**Rares**

- Ace Holden has First Strike and not First strike.

- Arcane Daguerotype misses some text in the box. What does it do?!?!?

- Kayeri Warchief: I think you could push it by making it ""Put a +1/+1 counter on each of those creatures."" That wording also avoids the confusion of ""which creature does **it** refer to?""

- Map to Orogrande: I think I would never use that. I'd be too afraid to lose too much life. Not sure how to fix it though...

- I really like how Rallyridge Quartermaster can sac your used guns and replace them with new ones from your library.

- Pumpkinead: Why not ""You and creatures you control have protection from Birds""? That would make it a little better but hit the flavor even harder imo. I could even see that be an uncommon, as is it' a pretty disappointing rare to crack in a pack, wouldn't you say?

- Titan of Progress: Why would you want to have that many Plains in your hand after turn 6? ""Progress"" should give you Auras or Equipments imo (or both!)

What's shameful is the DNC randomly using people to attack Donald Trump's character.

The mother of the Benghazi victim actually did have reason to direct her anger toward Hillary, ESPECIALLY after email leaks which showed her involvement (or lack thereof) in the attack and her lying about it, trying to blame a video that provoked (""otherwise peaceful"") Muslims from attacking the embassy, or calling family members of those who died liars.

Donald Trump didn't vote to have their child sent to war. Hillary did.

Also,

&gt;Trump has made it clear he wants policies that will discriminate against people based on their religion.

No, that's not the case at all. Have you been paying attention to the attacks going on in Europe? It is not discrimination to prevent possible national security risks from coming into your country.

The Qing were of course considered as *foreigners* to both China and Tibet.  Once the Qing collapsed, Tibet declared themselves independent from Jurchen rule and had de facto independence until the ccp's imperialistic invasion of Tibet in 1950.

Look how silly this would sound if we apply it to anywhere else.  ""Rome conquered Egypt far in the past.  Then later conquered Britain.  When Rome collapsed, the Egyptians claimed they had the right to rule Britain... uh... because... uh... some strange Chinese logic.""  Only in China I guess...

As for Hong Kong, I mostly I agree with you.  I just want consistency from the Chinese.  If it's their right to inherently rule Tibet because ""they conquered them against their will in the past"", then shouldn't that same logic be applied to Britain who also won HK in the past?

And Mainland China is a corrupt censoring totalitarian oligarchy.  Can you really blame the people from HK for not wanting to be a part of that?  I'm not saying things were perfect under Britain.  But at least they weren't a corrupt censoring totalitarian oligarchy.

And did just about every RC under the sun that was out around 2007 (so all the 2c's, good and bad, many times). My point being, you can do any drug while in college or having a good job and still be successful at it (was not bragging about my past drug use because, well I'm not exactly proud of it but not ashamed of it either because it ((my drug use)) made me who I am today which is someone I am completely happy with at this point in my life).
    So yeah. You'll probably do fine if you are studious and stay up on your school work. There's time to work, time to play, and in college, plenty of time to do both at the same time. Everyone is different though. I spent many nights, sometimes 5 nights a week, strung out in the library until 5am working on homework or projects.

Spirit: Has a few things they need to work out with their backline when Krieger and Zadorsky are gone.  Church in particular was so outmatched by Sky Blue last week.  

Boston: I don't even know what the problem is here.  On paper they should be much better than they are.  Is it their fitness? Their coaching? Interesting that McCaffrey left and immediately scored in her first full game for Chicago.

Sky Blue - They've been plagued by players with nagging minor injuries.  Are they not doing recovery right? Are they just unlucky?

Reign - I'm not quite sure why they are so much worse than last season.  They had very little roster turnover.  Fishlock being hurt for the first part of the season was likely part of it, but doesn't explain everything.",1470009750

"DC_Cinematic","t5_2ykm6","The line ""you flew too close to the sun"" is a reference to Icarus. Icarus was a tragic character who died because he over stretched himself. So Lex sees Zod as a tragic character who tried to bite of more than he could chew. He could also be referring to himself because he has his own Icarus moment when the ship asks him if he wants to assume command. Jesse plays this moment perfectly because it's clear that Lex realises he's at a point of no return and does it anyway. So that he then feels a kinship with Zod after himself having taken such a bold step makes sense. That weird tragic kinship also gives him the resolve to go through with his Doomsday plan.

The ""for 20 American he didn't see you"" line is them just trying to get a few bucks out of Clark by saying they'll not help anyone that might come looking for him. They assume he wants to die and doesn't want anyone to follow him to try to stop him.",1470009751

""Dave? Could you get that copy of the Blooms' quarter review for me? You said you'd have it on my desk by this morning.""

""Right away, Sharon. Sorry to keep you waiting.""

Fuck Sharon. I bet she got rammed over the weekend. Some married guy that keeps promising to get the divorce and yet they're still meeting up at the sleaziest motel in town every Saturday night, like clockwork. Sad, pathetic clockwork.

""Good, thanks. How was your weekend?""

""Fine. Yours?""

She looks to the floor wantonly. Bingo.

""Oh fine.. Hurry on that copy now.""

Clickclick. Clickclick. The sound of her heels on the hard-tile floor is just too much for this time in the morning; not dissimilar from when your teeth accidentally scrape against each other in that specific, horrific way. It's all too much. In the cubicle next to me, the fuckwit (Larry maybe?) keeps clicking his pen. One click. Then two fast clicks. One click, two clicks. And the cubicle over the cunt Susan (I only remember her because she got her name in the paper for losing her toe in a kitchen fire) is cackling away, on the phone to her cunt friends while I'm being bitched at for not working through the weekend, the only days when I don't feel like screaming in someones fucking face.

""Dave?""

""I'M DOING IT!""

The office goes silent. I clear my throat a little.

""I won't be a minute.""

The torrent of talking, typing and mindlessness resumes. I guess I'll copy this fucking thing. Maybe I'll rub my balls on it. Ha. No one's at the copier, thank fuck. If there's anything I hate more than most shit it's a fucking line. I tell you, much more of this and I'm gonna.. 'CHILL'... appears on the copier screen. 

What? I jab the big, green print button a couple of times. No response. Steve's walking past. I'll get him to fix it.

""Steve, you know how to work this thing. Can you help me out?""

""It looks fine to me. If it's jammed just tear the paper out,"" and continues on his way down the aisle.

""I know but.."" The screen was back to normal. Weird. Again, I jab the big, green button. 

'Dave. This is God. We need to talk.'

What the shit? This wasn't even clever. I bet this was Steve, that fuck says 'durrr, it looks fine to me'. You try and prank me will you? Well prepare for fucking war you..

'This is not Steve trying to prank you. This is God. When you were seven you dressed up like Cher and you're Dad sent you saw you and sent you to Christian camp.'

...God? Can you hear my thoughts?

'Yes. And you're right, Sharon is fucking a married man.'

I knew it! Oh, err, about the fucked up shit I think..

'There's no time for that. I need you're help. I'm trapped in this copier machine. My only hope is if you destroy Satan.'

What?!? Seriously? *Me*? Why don't you get you're angels to help? Or Steve?

'Me and my angels are all trapped in the stationary and electronics around your office. Gabriel is your pencil. He says he doesn't forgive you for the places you put him.'

This is awkward. Where's Satan then? Where is he, that bastard?

'*She* is Sharon.'

At that moment, a hand touches my shoulder.

""Is there a hold up Dave?"" Sharon's voice. 

I immediately start laying into her. A right hook, another; then a left.

""You monster! Let God out of the Copier! Let him out.""

The police swiftly arrived and arrested a man they deemed *biblically insane*. Sharon was taken to hospital, they say we she won't make it through the night. No one could say quite what happened that day, and, as the last white-shirted worker turned off the lights and left the once uneventful office building, the copier machine screen booted up.

This is not to say that there is not progress within the industry by any means, but almost nothing will prevent you from taking as good of a picture with a camera released today vs one released two years ago.

The X30 is still available new and supported by Fuji so it should still provide many years of use. I have no personal experience with the camera itself, but it should prove to be perfectly fine. As a sony user however, I am keen to recommend the RX100 and if you can perhaps stretch your budget a little more, the sony A6000 would be a great purchase.

Realmente o problema nem é os exames serem feitos com o objectivo de garantir uma certa taxa de chumbos. O problema é que a forma mais fácil de conseguir isso é introduzir factores ""de sorte"":

Introduzir aleatoriamente perguntas obscuras e irrelevantes numa certa percentagem de exames, ou introduzir perguntas ambiguas que garantem sempre uma certa percentagem de respostas erradas, etc. 

Criterios de chumbo baseados em erros quase irrelevantes, descuidos proprios de quem é inexperiente e que toda a gente os fará nos primeiros tempos até ganhar pratica (é só uma questão de ter sorte de não os fazer durante o exame).

&gt; Researchers at MIT have developed a portable system that can produce biologic drugs on-demand, obviating the need for expensive centralized manufacturing and potentially enabling doctors working in remote or developing parts of the world to create biopharmaceuticals that may be otherwise inaccessible.

&gt; &amp;quot;Currently, manufacturing of biologic drugs in the biopharmaceutical industry relies heavily on large-scale fermentation batches that are frequently monitored offline, to ensure a robust process and consistent quality of product,&amp;quot; the paper explains.

&gt; &amp;quot;But if you could engineer a single strain,&amp;quot; offers MIT bioengineer Tim Lu in a statement, &amp;quot;Or maybe even a consortia of strains that grow together, to manufacture combinations of biologics or antibodies, that could be a very powerful way of producing these drugs at a reasonable cost.""

"CGPGrey","t5_2u93l","""My other personal annoyance is when people try to put two different things in a single comment. I always feel like, 'If you have multiple things to say, leave multiple comments.'""

**TL;DR CGPGrey's opinion on leaving multiple comments benefits himself, but would be a bad decision for the person actually writing the comments, and also bad for the system if it were widely adopted.**

It would seem CGPGrey is not really familiar with how comments sections like on Reddit work.

In any thread with more than like 100 comments (side note: every Hello Internet post will have more than 100 comments), there's a vast wash of unread comments near the bottom. You can tell this because there are a bunch of comments sitting at the default 1 point, meaning nobody either upvoted OR downvoted them, meaning that probably no one else read them. 

For instance, this thread right now has 181 comments. Of those, 50 are replies to the first 6 most upvoted comments. That is to say, comments sections are exponential decay; a couple of comments get popular, so then they get replies, which then get replies, but if you go purely by top-level comments alone, upvotes and replies drop off sharply and then have a bunch of basically ignored comments. 

**This means that if you were to leave multiple comments, you are in fact increasing the chances of what you're writing not getting read by anyone,** both by increasing the number of posts you write each of which has only a relatively small probability of being upvoted and noticed, and by systemic effects if everybody were to adopt this position, which would result in dramatically more comments, only exacerbating the structural problems of comments sections I've previously mentioned.

Now, none of this should be a surprise to CGPGrey, who IIRC talked in an HI episode about [how users' attention quickly falls off](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/) to the point where a lot of people will see the top-left of a webpage and then viewership dramatically plunges.

So if this is an ineffective writing style for the person leaving the comment, who does it benefit? It benefits CGPGrey, who prefers things to be neat and categorized for him to read. But it would be bad for the actual comment writer, as it reduces the chance that what they're writing will be read.",1470009759

Last thing I can remember coming out of my mom's mouth before a distracted driver swerved into our lane resulting in a head-on collision at a 70-mph strech of highway. I don't remember the accident itself, I just remember coming out of a daze and finding myself being suspended in the air from the passenger side rear seat. Our SUV had ended up on its left side, with the right-side windows facing the cloudy sky. My mother had been taking 5 year old me and my 2 year old sister to kindergarten and pre-k, respectively. The vehicle that hit us was a pickup truck and the driver had been reaching for something in the back seat. My mother had a crushed skull, and a punctured lung amongst other smaller injuries, my sister had both her legs broken, a broken arm, and her left eye had recessed into its socket. 

I had a bruise.

I never saw my mother again. I'm told that she struggled against the firefighters when they tried to put an oxygen mask on her, thinking it was preventing her from breathing. Her brain ceased to function the next morning and was pronounced dead. It was the day she would have turned 32. My dad later ordered a closed-casket memorial, because apparently she was so disfigured he was afraid no one would recognize her at the service. 

This will have happened 16 years ago this September. ",1470009759

*****
&gt; Researchers at MIT have developed a portable system that can produce biologic drugs on-demand, obviating the need for expensive centralized manufacturing and potentially enabling doctors working in remote or developing parts of the world to create biopharmaceuticals that may be otherwise inaccessible.

&gt; &amp;quot;Currently, manufacturing of biologic drugs in the biopharmaceutical industry relies heavily on large-scale fermentation batches that are frequently monitored offline, to ensure a robust process and consistent quality of product,&amp;quot; the paper explains.

&gt; &amp;quot;But if you could engineer a single strain,&amp;quot; offers MIT bioengineer Tim Lu in a statement, &amp;quot;Or maybe even a consortia of strains that grow together, to manufacture combinations of biologics or antibodies, that could be a very powerful way of producing these drugs at a reasonable cost.""

*****
&gt; Researchers at MIT have developed a portable system that can produce biologic drugs on-demand, obviating the need for expensive centralized manufacturing and potentially enabling doctors working in remote or developing parts of the world to create biopharmaceuticals that may be otherwise inaccessible.

&gt; &amp;quot;Currently, manufacturing of biologic drugs in the biopharmaceutical industry relies heavily on large-scale fermentation batches that are frequently monitored offline, to ensure a robust process and consistent quality of product,&amp;quot; the paper explains.

&gt; &amp;quot;But if you could engineer a single strain,&amp;quot; offers MIT bioengineer Tim Lu in a statement, &amp;quot;Or maybe even a consortia of strains that grow together, to manufacture combinations of biologics or antibodies, that could be a very powerful way of producing these drugs at a reasonable cost.""

I knew you'd mention about tyrannical governments, Americans always like to make this point. Despite what you may have been taught in school, Britain has never been a tyranny. US history is full of stories that demonise the British, especially King George III, the king who denied the US to become an independent country until they took it by force. Did you know that George III was incredibly popular? He was the 3rd most popular monarch in British history after Elizabeth II and Victoria. His popularity came from the working class, farmers mostly; his nickname was Farmer George.

From my own view points I'd say our country is far less corrupt than your own, despite having no guns in the general populace. The idea that your politicians are almost required to lobby for third party interests is insane to me; to even be accused of doing the same in the UK would be a very serious matter, one of public inquiry. I don't like the current Government we have in the UK, but I'm not afraid of them turning against the public just because we have no guns. Do you honestly think that if the US did become a tyranny that a some untrained citizens would even be required to overthrow them?

Shorter scales have a sweeter, more rounded, smoother tone, with more inharmonicity and a less focused bass response. If you want a fat, mid-heavy, thick sound, as opposed to a tight, focused, bold tone, a shorter scale is better for this.

Also, shorter scales mean less tension, if the string gauge and pitch are held constant. This means two things: Bends are easier, or alternatively, you can use heavier strings (if you prefer that tone) without sacrificing the ability to bend.

Making ambitious games with a small dev team tends to take a while. They are taking the time to properly complete their game instead of just labeling it as complete and fuck off like what CodeHatch did with StarForge.


 &gt;Yet there's no meaningful progress towards anything worthwhile. I mean, shitty balance is still in the game. Who the hell wants campfire caps? Still in there for a year. Free reviving? Yup, still going strong. Performance still garbage? Hell yeah, that one never changes. With all the so called ""performance updates"" you'd have thought something would have happened.
This game in particular has so many problems. I could go for hours here, seriously. I still find adding microtransactions into an early-access game hilarious myself. Or remaking the entire game into something completely different. Or putting the game on sale when claiming it won't whilst in alpha.

Increasing the amount of beam shots can be directly done by weapon haste (one of the most under-rated and free sources of Weapon haste is Temporal Cross-wiring in Temp Op spec and stacking exotic dmg abilities together to stack this haste 4 times). But, long-term the best chances for increasing beam shots is ensuring that ship positioning is on-point for the entire duration of BFAW and even during regular beam firing. 

The other aspect to increasing plasma explosion is boosting ""+all damage"" sources as well as implementing strong damage resistance reduction to the targets you're shooting by stacking your buffs like Attack Pattern Omega/Beta/Delta as well as possible. ",1470009771

So lets just say it cost him 20 million to raise 227 million. Yea I know more then likely off but that is close enough. Anyway that would mean he spent 207 million and still borrowed more to the point he had to sell his endorsement to Clinton to get her or the DNC to pay off his debts. He sold out instead of trusting his supporters who would have gladly helped him pay those debts. 

The other option is that he did not spend anything close to 207 million after paying 20 million to raise it. He handed that pile of cash over to Clinton then walked away from both his supporters and the DNC.

How can he claim to want to push the DNC more left when he left the party?

Bernie Sanders should have at least endorsed Jill Stein if he did not want to run as a third party. By not running as a green or endorsing her while I disagree with him on many issues the guy forever lost a lot of people's respect. ",1470009773

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt;I was sexually active at 19

I don't know if you are being disingenuous or if you missed the point of my entire post, but nowhere do I say 19 year olds can't have sex.

&gt;and I believe that at 19 I was mature enough to make my own choices about sex. We didn't force her in to anything, we approached her and asked. We didn't groom her, we didn't want to form a relationship, it was just sex.

Again this misses the point. You yourself commented on how odd it is for you boyfriend to be trying to engage someone significantly younger than him. The same applies here.

&gt;I think it a 19 year old wants to have a threesome, they are typically of sound mind to make that decision.

Come on OP, you can disagree, but what you just wrote is blatantly reductionist. In fact it misses the entire point of contention.  

The question at hand was whether it was wise/ethical to have a threesome with her (or someone as young), not whether or not she has the obvious right to decide to have sex or not.

&gt;I don't think there is anything wrong with people having purely sexual relationships with others regardless of age (as long as everyone is over 18). Relationships are different. No way do I agree a 19 year old and a 29 year old should be dating. But a one night stand? I don't think that's wrong.

Well if that is what you believe than I guess we will just have to disagree.  While it is easy to imagine these things as separate and distinct in abstract conception, I would argue that it is nowhere near as neat in practice. The domain of the concepts as mapped by the function of the human experience generally shows them to more intertwined than distinct (at that is just what is seen, and not potentially unseen beneath the surface). I grant that it is a matter that would be hard to concretely prove one way or another, but I will note (sadly on your behalf) that this situation shows things tend to be messier than we imagine. You boyfriend and your friend are in the wrong. They are going against the understanding you all set up and tried to keep you in the dark.  But the entire reason for that understanding in the first places was the inherent potential this had to not so neatly play out.",1470009773

"samharris","t5_2thqg","&gt; I am not sure what this means, but if Harris does not claim to have done it, then great.

I suspect that /u/Fiblasco is thinking of comments like these-

&gt; Ryan wrote that my “proposed science of morality cannot offer scientific answers to questions of morality and value, because it cannot derive moral judgments solely from scientific descriptions of the world.” But no branch of science can derive its judgments solely from scientific descriptions of the world...

&gt; Contrary to what Ryan suggests, I don’t believe that the epistemic values of science are “self-justifying”—we just can’t get completely free of them...

&gt; So I think the distinction that Ryan draws between science in general and the science of medicine is unwarranted. He says, “Science cannot show empirically that health is good. But nor, I would add, can science appeal to health to defend health’s value, as it would appeal to logic to defend logic’s value.” But science can’t use logic to validate logic. It presupposes the value of logic from the start. Consequently, Ryan seems to be holding my claims about moral truth to a standard of self-justification that no branch of science can meet. Physics can’t justify the intellectual tools one needs to do physics. Does that make it unscientific? [(Harris, *Clarifying the Moral Landscape*)](https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/clarifying-the-landscape)

He's right that Harris says here that no science can validate itself, and that the science of ethics is just like other sciences in this regard.  But he's wrong when he infers from this that, on Harris' principles, the validation of the science is something that no reasonable person cares about, or is something that doesn't matter.  And he's wrong when he infers from this that Harris merely circumvents the problem, as one which supposedly no reasonable person cares about, and thereby circumvents the issue of the is-ought distinction.

For, to the contrary, when Harris gives this argument about the inability of sciences to validate themselves, he does not restrict himself to making this negative point about how the relevant validation does not come from the sciences themselves, but rather goes further and explains where it *does* come from.  Here he is, in the same passages quoted above:

&gt; But no branch of science can derive its judgments solely from scientific descriptions of the world. We have intuitions of truth and falsity, logical consistency, and causality that are foundational to our thinking about anything...  the fact is that all forms of scientific inquiry pull themselves up by some intuitive bootstraps. Gödel proved this for arithmetic, and it seems intuitively obvious for other forms of reasoning as well. I invite you to define the concept of “causality” in noncircular terms if you would test this claim. Some intuitions are truly basic to our thinking. I claim that the conviction that the worst possible misery for everyone is bad and should be avoided is among them.

In this analysis, Harris asks us to distinguish between the ""scientific descriptions of the world"" which are the product of scientific inquiry, and the ""intuitions"" which are foundational to our thinking about anything and which make scientific inquiry possible.  On the question of where the relevant validation of scientific value judgments come from, Harris answers both negatively, that it doesn't come from *scientific descriptions of the world*, and positively, that it does come from *intuition*.

But then the question of the validation of these value judgments isn't something that Harris circumvents, as a matter that reasonable people don't care about, but rather something that he addresses directly, appealing to intuition as a means of validation and a basis of our values.

When this theory is applied to the particular problem of the science of ethics, it produces a substantial response to the is-ought distinction.  Harris defends the utilitarian sort of thesis about values, according to which we should do or should not do some action according to the aggregate utility (happiness as positive/suffering as negative) it has as a consequence.  And he defends it like this: we have a basic intuition which informs us that this is so.

/u/Fiblasco misrepresents this assessment as merely a language game, as if Harris is doing nothing more than telling us that he merely stipulates that the terms 'good' and 'bad' be understood, within the language game that he is playing, in this way.  It's evident from this passage that that isn't what Harris is doing.  Harris isn't reporting on a mere stipulation here, but rather reporting on an intuition, neither does he take such intuitions to be the basis of a merely arbitrary use of language, but rather takes them to be the basis of rational thinking as such, and accordingly he takes these intuitions as having substantial consequences for matters of fact.

Incidentally, I hope this thread has long since rebutted, to every reasonable person's satisfaction, /u/Fiblasco's original charge that people who are critical of Harris' positions in discussions like this do not offer substantial criticisms of them.",1470009773

Getting data, even data about conditions nobody would actually vape under, makes sense to me. That data can be used to build safer devices, etc.

If an overweight, spotty and short geeky guy with greasy hair comes over and talks to them and goes for a kiss, it's ""oh my god what a creep go away"" as if the poor dude is somehow doing something wrong. However if it's a classically handsome guy or someone they find attractive it's ""romantic"". 

I can hand on heart say I have never heard of a guy calling a girl ""weird"" or ""creepy"" for making moves when the guy wasn't into her. Girls almost seem to be offended if a guy makes a move who they don't think is attractive enough for them.

EDIT:

Most people seem to be missing the point. I'm not saying that girls don't do creepy things, I'm saying that when girls do NORMAL or flirtatious things when a guy isn't into them they are usually just either ignored or turned down. I'm not talking about following guys round all day with a hand down their pants, that is not romantic on any level regardless of how the guy feels. When guys do things that a girl *would* find romantic if they were attracted to them (but are not attracted to them) such as randomly buying flowers, going for a kiss, etc., girls somehow seem offended and are often pretty dismissive and rude.",1470009783

One of my favorite shops to visit is the Peaceable Kingdom (I got my Totoro postcards there!) and every time I go I leave a penny at the fairy door, just in case. The parking structure I like to use has a fairy garden outside of it, too. I don't frequently leave stuff there because I like to think that my parking fees pay for the upkeep and keep the fairies happy. 

Right now the weather has been really hot. It's rained the past few days, though, which I'm very grateful for. It'd been abnormally dry this year, and I hardly saw any thunderstorms during the usual time. 

My favorite shops downtown are:

* The Peaceable Kingdom - knick knacks and fun stuff!

* Crazy Wisdom - Metaphysical bookstore and tea room

* Vault of Midnight - Comic bookstore!

* Kilwin's - delicious, delicious chocolate :)

When transcribing don't take on entire solos at once. If Bill Evans played a minor ii v lick and you like it a lot you can learn just that measure and apply it to other minor ii vs in other keys. If you happen to find out through this the classical minor harmonic scale sounds really good during a minor ii v progression then you could use variations of the scale.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","As an English-only speaker, the different languages are interesting.  Spanish and Portuguese seem closely related:

* Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal
* Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal

From context, guessing Piedra/Pedra means Stone, which makes me think of the historical site Petra and the name Peter.

The un-American English is straight-forward:

* Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

Did not know there was a Luxembourgish:

* Den Harry Potter an den Alchimistesteen

I read that as ""The Harry Potter and the Alchemist's Stone"".  Reminds me of Full Metal Alchemist which also had a Philosopher's Stone.

The German and Danish seem related:

* Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen
* Harry Potter og De Vises Sten

""Harry Potter and the Stone of the Wise""?

Thought the French would look more like Spanish/Portuguese (romance languages):

* Harry Potter à l'école des sorciers

""Harry Potter and the Stone of Sorcery""?

And of course, the Japanese looks like none of the European languages:

* ハリー・ポッターと賢者の石

I read that as ""Harry Potter and Some Kanji"".  Guess it would be weird to line break the title before と particle.",1470009804

"subpac","t5_34kt3","The 'listen to' thing only works for specific hardware, and generally isn't a good way to go. I believe they're saying to send the audio output of one sound card into the mic input of a second, then tell windows to mix the mic input into the normal output. If you have the right hardware, you could try this, but it may not sound very good.

Two other options:

1. Simplest - Use bluetooth to send sound to the M2, connect your headphones to the M2's headphone output via a wire. This isn't completely wireless, but at least avoids a wire back to the computer.

2. Fully wireless - Use Voicemeter Banana (or equiv software) to send the audio out to both the M2 and headphones simultaneously. I recommend Voicemeter because it's relatively easy to setup and the free version works for this purpose. The UI *looks* complex when you first see it, but there are just a couple things you need on there. I'm using the default Voicemeeter VAIO input, which you set to be your default windows audio device, then you set A1 and A2 to your Headphones and M2.

Here's an example of how I have mine setup for Rift+Subpac. Note - I'm connecting the subpac via a wire from my motherboard's sound card, but you could just as easily be using bluetooth here.

Protip - you can rename the various sound cards in windows by double-clicking on them. Makes it easy to know which is which.

[Vernon](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgEpvgQUEAAtDzJ.jpg:orig) and, 
[Dino](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgEq4ATUsAAYNmF.jpg:orig)). 

They are broken up into three 'units', the [Performance Unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV3TxqD1AoE) (Hoshi [Leader], Jun, The8 and, Dino), the [Hip Hop Unit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svaIgkpVC6Q) (S.Coups [Leader], Wonwoo, Mingyu and, Vernon), and the [Vocal Unit](https://youtu.be/GNNhb3hvm58?t=1m10s) (Woozi [Leader], Jeonghan, Joshua, Dokyeom and, Seungkwan) each unit has it's own leader with S.Coups also being the overall group leader. They have two American members (Vernon and Joshua) and two Chinese members (Jun and The8).

They are known for the fact that they write/compose/produce/choreograph their own songs (in collaboration with other producers and choreographers ofc but they seem very involved in the direction of their own music). This is fairly impressive considering most groups (especially ones that are as young as Seventeen is) are not able to work on their music at all (they often are not allowed to). 

They debuted roughly one year ago on May 26, 2015.

I have been thinking about this a lot recently. I just can't picture what he would say. Maybe he will quadruple-down and allege fraud/rigging, or just not give a speech. It's too hard to for me to see him saying ""congratulations to Hillary Clinton, the next president of the United States.""

On the other side, I wonder what a Hillary concession speech would look like. She has been in the game too long to not give one, but her camp's rhetoric has been so strong against Trump that I don't know what the fallout will look like. Will she announce that it's now ""midnight in America?"" or just take the safe route and say she hopes the next four years will be positive for America, while avoiding speaking directly about Trump? When you go so hard against your opponent (as is understandable against Trump) it's seems like it would be weird to hand over the keys to the U.S. to them.

**Why:** Every single game I've ever played, I've always played the healer / buffer archetype. I just love keeping my team alive and helping them not get completely rekt. A good healer carries any team to victory. I've been playing the healer of the group ever since I started playing TF2 (when it came out, jesus, that long ago?). My buddies helped me farm Trinity (more like carried me and kept picking me up when I died in the mission, R5 Excal super tanky 0/10) and carried me for the resources when I started getting into Warframe, and I pay them back by picking them up when I can and clutching Blessings all day every day. I've even expanded on my healer archetype and branched out to other frames that have healing capabilities (Oberon-senpai, Hydroid puddle augment best augment). I just can't bring myself to play something that can't heal teammates in some way, shape, or form. I've never been that frontline DPS master-ass-blaster guy or the guy who shrugs off damage, I protect my team, they protect me.

Also jesus fucking christ crafting anything Archwing is **stupid** expensive. My clan is working through research, the oxium cost for the Amesha wings is killing me because everyone is out of oxium from their crafting, so I'm left solo trying to fund this thing.

**Products Used: (nude lip day)**

* **Face:** Covergirl CG Smoothers BB Cream in fair to light, Glossier Stretch Concealer in Light (under eyes)
* **Cheeks:** Tarte Rainforest after Dark Palette blush and bronzer (for subtle contouring), and Glossier Haloscope in Quartz
* **Eyes:** Tarte Rainforest after Dark Palette (just the matte browns), Revlon ColorStay Liquid Liner between my lashes, and Covergirl Lashblast Volume mascara in very black
* **Brows:** Glossier Boy Brow in Blond, Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz in Taupe
* **Lips:** Kylie Lip Kit in Koko (I'm absolutely obsessed with this color on me.)
* **Bonus:** I used this random brown eye liner I've had forever to darken in the mole next to my eye and to slightly darken some of my freckles. It's Rimmel Special Eyes Eye Liner Pencil in Rich Brown.

**Products Used: (Black lippie day)**

* Face: Covergirl CG Smoothers BB Cream in fair to light
* Cheeks: Glossier Haloscope in Quartz
* Eyes: just a little Glossier Haloscope in Quartz across my lids, and my fave Covergirl Lashblast Volume mascara in very black
* Brows: Glossier Boy Brow in Blond
* Lips: Kylie Lip Kit in Dead of Knight


So the nude lip day was the day before I did the black lips. Normally when I have a completely clean base I have to fill in my lash line with liner because of how light my eye lashes are. It makes them seem much fuller I think. I didn't do this the second day since I hadn't done the best job removing all the eyeliner from my lash line the night before.

So I'm pretty lazy when it comes to makeup so this is pretty much the extent of what I will do on any given day. Most days it's just the BB cream, boy brow, and mascara. 

I'm definitely looking for recommendations though on a better BB cream because I struggle with my skin tone being really uneven and translucent. Also every BB cream I find that I think is light enough ends up pulling really yellow on me. I would also love recommendations for a TAUPE mascara. Somedays I would like to go a little fairer with my makeup but every brown mascara I've tried ends up looking red on me so for now I sometimes use a clear mascara. ",1470009819

It's quite creepy/amazing how perfect this song fits right into the movie and is pretty much the equivalent time length. The lyrics are only 4 minutes long of a whole 23 minutes, but I feel like they reflect the symbolism of Evolution/mankind/humanity, just like 2001: A Space Odyssey does as well. I definitely prefer watching this version now more than the orginal soundtrack to the film :D

The first 5 minutes of the song is it's own musical brilliance and perfectly suits the flight into space. Then around 5:53 the verse ends, and the digital effects come into play. At 8:11 the audio shifts into a different pace and the movie starts displaying different galaxies/nebulas/planets. Then around 12 minutes the music shifts again and the movie starts observing the planets up close, showing strange colors/landscapes. This music concludes around 15:20, which is the next/final scene in the movie :)

"HPfanfiction","t5_2t100","So, a combination of high favourite count, personal recommendations, the first chapter being well written sometimes, and the authors starting notes all affect the chance of me reading such a fic. And how bored I am, I guess. 

An example of where this fails, is for instance the fic Rise of the Drackens (just as an example of the top of my head). This fic is on the first page of Ao3's Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling tag, when sorted by kudos, and, is frankly one of the worst M-preg fics I've ever read. Even amongst creature fics it's bad. There were also a couple of people who pointed me towards it. I read something like 700k words of it before getting so frustrated that I dropped it, and never read any of the derivative creature fics, despite me being quite willing to read bad fiction if it's a creature fic. 

This is why I generally skim the first chapter before dismissing out of hand. If it admits to M-preg and the summary is bad, on the other hand, that likely means that I won't even bother with the initial skim. 

So, really, I take each in a case by case basis, but find the vast, vast majority fall short. 

At one point I'd read all the fics that interested me in the first 30 pages of Ao3's HP sorted by kudos (I was really really bored for a few months), so I know I've read a lot of M-preg, just none of it was very memorable, excepting the really really bad ones. 

Out of curiosity, are there any you would recommend? ",1470009821

They're a business not focused on the long run and even if there were good people working at niantic or even Nintendo they're likely getting quieted because the higher ups are all about making the most amount of profit NOW. This means opening up to more countries is a priority. And that tracker for 1) was causing people to walk around with their face in their phone, which is dangerous from a legal standpoint. And 2) those 3rd party trackers were likely either stealing resources from the servers or gaining profit from a program that is not theirs. Heck the company could even technically go after people on etsy selling Pokemon go logos and stuff because it isn't their intellectual property and the company is not getting a cut. I don't think they are going to do that, but these are the things that matter to businesses. 
And these companies are focused on making money now. NOW. Not long term. This means opening up to all the countries is a priority. Not the 3 step issue. 
In either case I don't doubt they're likely working on that in some way, but since it is not their priority it isn't likely going to be fixed super fast. But you never know. 
Their PR could be better. And heck Nintendo has been going downhill since GameCube anyways. I'm certainly not defending their business practices. I've been bothered by them for years. They've consistently brought out great products with great potential but didn't quite live up to it. 
But people working at niantic might likely even have a desire to fix these things but the higher ups are telling them no. Even if it's just the higher ups in niantic itself. 
It makes me laugh reading comments about leaving scathing reviews or ranting like trying to get together a virtual angry mob with pitchforks and torches is really going to even irk them. They're used to your crap already. And your just giving yourself a headache. 
Besides its not as though this game was really going to solve world hunger or anything. It was just fun for a little bit. That's all. People need to have more than a Pokemon game to get motivated to get out of the house anyways because it was only ever going to be a fad. Everyone was going to get tired of it eventually. For those that don't... I worry for those people...
As for me, I stopped playing for a couple weeks now because it was HOT outside. Not the 3 step issue. No amount of rare Pokemon is going to make me go out in 90+ degree weather. I'm patient. I'll wait.

"intj","t5_2qowo","Right now, I have the perception that I don't interrupt people much and that I listen well. This is perpetuated by years of people telling me I'm a great listener and it's nice not to be interrupted, and also exactly zero instances of anyone telling me that I'm not a great listener and that I keep interrupting them.

Recently, I noticed I've been interrupting a person very dear to me fairly frequently to voice some related anecdote to what they're saying or something I really need to say. The main reason for this is that I've had a lot on my mind and I haven't really been able to talk to anyone about it. I may not be voicing what's been on my mind, but voicing something helps.

So TL;DR: your INTJ may not be noticing he's doing this because of years of listening well and everyone being too nice to call him out on recent conversation interrupting. You will likely need to be that person and he may have a momentarily depressed moment of ""oh..."" since he didn't realize he was being such a dickmabob. Additionally, he may usually listen well but may be involuntarily exuding thoughts through his mouth-hole because of pent up thoughts.

Maybe tell him that you think anger is a normal emotion and you can understand why he gets  angry with your mom sometimes.  But you've noticed that the anger is starting to take over his life,  and he should know that that isn't normal. I would guess he thinks obsessively sometimes about how people have wronged him,  and that can be draining and frustrating.  It's not uncommon,  there is a reason why anger management classes are a thing.  You want him to be happy and healthy,  so you think he has to talk to someone.

If you couldn't detect magic you couldn't  tell it was magic at all unless you tried it.

However,  there was a price for failure. If you failed badly enough on the umd check there was a backlash depending on the type of enchantment on the magic item had.  But the reverse was true too, if you critted the umd check alot of items had special features.

My friend got shunted whole body into the ethereal realm for an hour from one backlash, i got ring that was supposed to let me use an ice breath attack and,  after a critical umd, it turned my halfling into a draconic silver dragon form.",1470009827

&gt; After moving to South Texas and attending several Austin shows, Josh realized that the crowds lacked energy and physical participation. Upon further examination, he came to the conclusion that the lack of audience response was directly related to their fears of social damnation. In a too-hip-to-be-square world where no one wants to be the person dancing alone, the people needed someone or something to inspire the destruction of social constructs and the liberation of the one set of musical instruments that everyone possesses, whether they know it or not: their hands.

&gt; Amongst the wake of a clap-less music scene, it was San Marcos where the conception of Clap!Clap! took place. Armed with 10 members, including a clap choir, and more percussion instruments than you can shake a clave stick at, Clap!Clap! strives to bring clapping back into the music scene. Their self-titled first song is more than a theme for the band; it's a mission statement. It commands the common clergy folk to leave what reservations they have behind and bask in the fruition of dance. With over a year and a half of shows under their belt, Clap!Clap! has built a following most would envy. They stand tall in a sea of Texas bands and are in a constant continuum of pushing their music forward by testing the limits of their aural abilities. Clap!Clap! has taken their stake - prepare your hands and feet. It's time to get up so you can get down. Read more on Last.fm.

While there is no doubt that at times they may be placed in a dangerous situation with a vicious dog, or even a rabid cat and often angry humans, incidents where their lives are at stake are few and far between. THEY DON'T GO INTO ANY PLACE ALONE - THEY TAKE POLICE WITH THEM. Even when the 21 pit bulls from the dog fighting ring were seized in Chatham do you think OSPCA was at risk? They had a whole police force there at the time. They pay the highest profile lawyer in Canada so they can kill the dogs they seized. Millions of dollars are spent for their legal fees.  Millions more spent to cover up the idiotic mistake they made with the Ashworth dogs. That's your money they are spending. Do you really want to give them more?

They do not ever have to go into seize or investigate an animal or animals without having the backup of the local police or OPP. They like to make themselves look important so arrange for all the cruisers in the area to attend and do their bidding. It makes for good media. Remember the raid of cats a little while ago? They had about 8 cruisers and police even closed the street down for them. Yes, you read that right. The police on scene with an OSPCA investigation must take orders from OSPCA. Not the other way around.

I think what is happening here is that groups like RAAW (Reform Advocates for Animal Welfare) are raising enough public awareness to affect their bottom line - which is donations.  BTW, RAAW was formed after the fake ringworm disaster which cost 101 innocent lives.  I think this is a well planted article to push back, get more money and camouflage their misdeeds and mismanagement.

Before they are finished they will once again ask for guns. They've asked for them before. If that ever happens get prepared to move out of Ontario because you and your pets will not be safe. They do not need to have access to the CPIC. They can not be trusted with that information.

There have never been so many dog catchers and officials working at OSPCA or so much government funding. Yet there has never been so little done to protect our animals. In 2012 the provincial government gave them an additional $5 million **annually** to increase training and shut down puppy mills, especially those in the Amish area. When was the last time you heard about a puppy mill being closed? You haven't have you?  Ask yourself, where has that money gone?  No one knows because the OSPCA is not held accountable for their actions or governance.  When animals get help it is more often from the grassroots and Mom &amp; Pop rescues, who are doing what the OSPCA doesn't.

The clock speed is the big differentiator there - consoles have a 1.6-1.75GHz clock speed whereas your more modern PC core is both more efficient per clock and has a lot higher clock rate.

"ask_transgender","t5_31hoq","&gt;Okay, so, it started with someone who is non-binary tweeting that if you will not date a transgender person, you are transphobic.

I would agree ***IF*** the reason you refuse to date them is because they are transgender. There are a plethora of reasons not to date someone which are not transphobic (e.g. you like penises, and they don't have one, or they do not wish to use it in a sexual setting).

&gt;But this person argued that if I would not engage in a relationship with anyone no matter what their genitals were, than I was transphobic.

That would mean that almost everyone who is not bi/pan is transphobic, which isn't the case. By the same logic that this person is using, every straight man must be transphobic and misandrist, and every gay man must be transphobic and misogynist. That just seems absurd to me.

&gt;They said sex is not very important to a relationship, [...]

I would find it nigh on impossible to be in a long term relationship with someone that I was not sexually compatible with. Sex is (usually) an incredibly important part of a relationship.

I've been to a few shows where the production value is crazy, and every note hits exactly right, but it's like I'm watching a movie and I could've just as easily put on some good headphones and experienced it.

The primary reason I go to shows is to experience the songs with a crowd that has an equal emotional connection to them, and it becomes a very active and participatory experience as we all sing along and dance. When something goes wrong on stage, everyone in the crowd is sort of mentally aligned with the band and it's like we're working through it together to reach this emotional core that we've all tapped into.

Coming from this point of view, I've loved the last few MM shows I've been to, even though there were technical problems and some miscommunication on stage. If anything those moments enhanced my experience and didn't detract from it.

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt; My proposal would be to fork to a new POW similar to that of Ethereum with a hardfork difficulty bomb set in place to activate once per year. This hardfork would then be used to change the POW algorithm slightly each year so that it is not economically viable to develop and sell ASIC chips.

That's a cool idea!

It would be great if *everyone* could earn some coins mining, like in the early days - not just 6-7 Chinese miners next to some hydroelectric dam.

Gamecube released [""late 2001, early 2002""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube), meanwhile the PS2 showed up [""early 2000""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2), basically a year of no contest whatsoever from Nintendo. They had a whole year of next gen gaming available with literally no competition in sight for a whole year available.

And to put that in perspective, by the time the gamecube just released (Sept. 2001, and that's just for Japan), the PS2 had sold [""over 20 million units""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_sales) worldwide. In one year, the PS2 had stolen 20 mil potential customers from Nintendo.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt; Hillary Clinton is as corrupt as they come

Really? Woooooow. 

Now, let's parse that a bit. ""is as X as they come"" is an idiom meaning that the person referred to is the most X there is. ""as beautiful as they come"" would be the most beautiful. ""as smart as they come"" would be the smartest.

So your preposition is that Hillary is the most corrupt. 

Let's first define ""corrupt"". Cue wikipedia: Political corruption is the use of powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. 

She has gained privately over the years. There's been evidence purported to demonstrate that some private gain has been illegitimate, but nothing that has been proven. Although people have tried. (Cue the Whitewater investigation.)

Nothing has shown she's corrupt, but she's no Jimmy Carter, being honest to a fault. So let's assume that everything everyone has said is true. Would that make her the most corrupt?

Suharto: Embezzled $15-$35 billion.

Marcos: Embezzled up to $10 billion.

Mobuto Sese Seko: $5 billion. 

Even if every single bullshit allegation ever thought up in the heads of those suffering from Clinton Derangement Syndrome, she is nowhere near being the most corrupt.

So no, Hillary Clinton is not as corrupt as they come.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","An example would be trying to slide snipe, taking a hit then would render you dead pretty much. But yeah I agree and was a bit blind-sighted on that. But currently the majority of pulses/scouts do cause flinch and sometimes the blame for being sniped can be put on the sniper. I often complain about it but I can see that my aim was off or I just wasn't consistent enough with my shots. 

At top tier, you're expected to peek as the spots to peek are well known, by increasing flinch, there's an increased chance these spots will be useless. And high risk high reward is not really Destiny's thing what with the nades, shields, etc. It used to be for snipers and well, we used to be called skilled. I don't know honestly on this point. I don't want to revert back to Y1 where sniping was weak nor should it stay the same as it is right now. But anyway, dumb snipers are dumb snipers and what you said is true about long range. 

Agreed on primary kill speed but it's ridiculous the balance between primaries, say a grasp and a questing beast auto rifle. Grasp causes massive flinch and kills very fast and as far as I'm aware, a questing beast doesn't.

The game needs balancing and it has to have it's priorities in the right place. I'm also very tired right now so apologies for probably bad arguments, I just don't want to see anymore hardscopers than there are right now and I think flinch will cause that as hiding and scoping = no flinch whereas challenging in closer range and taking a hit last minute will fuck you over.",1470009842

* There is no such thing as dated.

&gt; what behavior do you want your players to exhibit?

I want them to have fun. I want to attract people to my game who like to take a few things seriously. I like it when people can get into it and roleplay, then work out a fake problem. I like it when players synergize abilities and get smart with builds.

Take Jim. Jim likes to walk down hallways that he knows are illusions. Little Jimmy wanders through dark, empty hallways instead of waits to be helped even though he gets a very bad feeling about something nearby. 3 failed rolls later, he has been tackled by a horror, gets into a fight with his friend, his friend wakes him from his nightmare, bada boom.

"vainglorygame","t5_32ob1","Congratulations! You get to be lore-ducated. Below is the relevant lore

FULL SOURCE: [Ardan's first chapter of Lore](http://www.vainglorygame.com/news/ardan-lore-impossible-decision/)

&gt;""I do not need your permission to buy a goat,” Julia said. “Goat milk is delicious, and we can make cheese.""

&gt;They’d been arguing all evening. Ardan was hunched over his power gauntlet, sanding down the edges of a grill he’d removed to improve air flow. Outside in the yard, a goat shrieked into the moonless dark. ""Goats stink and scream like fiends,"" he grumped. ""It hasn’t stopped for an hour. How will the twins sleep?""

&gt;""The kids need a pet. Are you dropping metal shavings on my divan?""

&gt;""And who will make this alleged cheese? When have you ever made cheese, your highness?""

&gt;""I could make cheese!"" Julia shouted. She stomped out of the room and slammed the bedroom door behind her, the goat’s cries dramatizing her exit.

&gt;Celeste toddled out of her room, rubbing sleep from her eyes. ""Dadda? Is Mamma alright?""

&gt;She had her mother’s accent. Ardan plucked up the toddler in his unarmored arm and kissed her cheeks. ""Mamma is being ridiculous.""

&gt;""What is ridick oo luss?""

&gt;""It means she brought a goat home without talking to me about it.""

&gt;""I like goats."" This from Vox, who wandered in after his sister. He seated himself on his father’s foot, wrapping his arms around Ardan’s leg and rode along as Ardan took Celeste back to bed, staring out the window toward the screams.

&gt;""You like the idea of goats. None of us actually know how to care for a goat.""

&gt;""There’s a baby crying outside,"" said Celeste, half asleep.

&gt;""It’s the stupid goat,"" said Ardan, planting her back in her bed.

&gt;Vox uncurled himself from his father’s leg. ""He’s afraid,"" he said. ""Maybe lonely.""

&gt;""It’s a she, Vox. At least I hope it is a she, or your mother’s dreams of cheese are—""

&gt;Ardan paused, turned toward the window.

&gt;The goat had stopped screaming.

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","It's probably going to end up being all about the total amount of planets. My latest pet project is MegaSystem, which takes a bunch of planet packs GN-style and merges them into one single solar system. With New Horizons, Alternis Kerbol, Uncharted Lands, Revamped Stock System, and a few others installed, the game does get slow sometimes. There's a general FPS drop, and even the editors tend to be a little more jittery. That's with eighty or so objects. Our real world solar system has 30-ish known objects big enough to be spherical. KSP systems in general have about 10-20 objects big enough to be spherical. So the game could probably feasibly handle around 4 to 8 stars, maybe stretching it up to 12. It's all a matter of your computer's specifications and how much performance you're willing to give up. Perhaps you might want to remove all of the planets from a star system until you're ready to go and send a probe there, and only keep a couple star systems active at a time. That would require breaking out of the game and swapping configs, but eh.

All of this is quite a way away, and I could be proven wrong. We'll have to see how this all turns out.",1470009845

"politics","t5_2cneq","Didn't McCain attack Trump first, though?

Same thing with this Khan guy at the DNC. Trump never heard of the man before the convention. So the man attacked Trump first.

And he did it based on deceit and false premises. He erroneously said that Trump would have banned his son, whose family emigrated from Pakistan decades ago. No, he wouldn't have. Because the family was vetted. It was NOT from a failed state, where the State Department couldn't get records [like Syria]. They had valid passports, documents and a papertrail establishing their identity. Pakistan also wasn't sending Jihadis to the US at the time to shoot up night clubs and demand sharia law.

So his attempt to conflate the two situations doesn't bear scrutiny. It's like someone being a doctor after having graduated med school and becoming board certified saying, ""That Trump banned a quack who didn't graduate high school, but was illegally practicing medicine means that Trump would have banned a board certified surgeon from a top school.""

No: One has papers; the other doesn't.

Trump's position is that you come *legally*, and if you can't be vetted (because you're coming from a failed state) there has to be a temporary moratorium until we can establish people's identities. He doesn't want to gamble with the lives of American citizens.

Trump would be remiss if he did so. (Even Mr. Khan's native Pakistan isn't taking in Syrian refugees.) Funny how he forgot to mention that.

The fact is: these false attacks can't go unchallenged.

It's only Trump's enemies who want him to ""take it and shut up"".

First rule of a failed politician: ""Allow your enemies to define you. Answer none of their attacks. Be passive.""",1470009846

It looks like something is either pushing or pulling on that area, which has caused the two parts of the boat to separate.  In your final photo which shows more of the cracks around the stern there is a stainless steel saddle - what connects to that?  Is the boat lifted or pulled from that point?  Could that be why it's separating?

If the area at the back is cracking due to pressure being put on it, then you are going to have do something a little stronger than just epoxy.  I would suggest you need to use some fiberglass cloth strips to reinforce the area.  Depending on the access you might be able to do that from the inside of the boat, then just use flowcoat on the cracks on the outside to make it waterproof.  Otherwise you are going to have big ugly parts of fibreglass around the back.


With the holes in the mast base, you should be able to seal them up with some flowcoat.  You should be able to buy flowcoat in a yellow colour that matches your boat.  Hopefully there is an inspection port that allows you to get interior access to the mast base.  Just put some masking tape behind the holes, then add the flowcoat from the outside.

The water under the floorboards sounds concerning - particularly the fact it's coming out around the mast base.  There should be some bungs around the stern that all you to drain out the water.  If there isn't perhaps it's time to drill some holes and add some!  Be sure to give the boat plenty of time to dry out inside.

Finally no boat I have seen is ever totally dry inside - your always going to have a little bit of leakage somewhere.  After you have gone sailing you need open up all the hatches and use a sponge to mop up any water inside.

EDIT:
Looking very closely at your pics, it seems that the mainsheet traveler may be the cause of the problems at the stern.  In your last photo it looks like the saddle is for a wire traveler right?  It looks like the screws for the saddle only go into the white top part of the fiberglass?  When there is pressure on the mainsheet, it's been pulling the white part up off the yellow, which is why they are separating?

If thats the case, you might be ok to just fix the cause of the problem, then use flowcoat to fix the cracks and make everything water tight.  You should un-screw remove the saddle, then drill bolt holes all the way through.  Use a bolt + washers and nuts which goes all the way from the top through to the underside to hold the saddles in place.  That way, it will be sandwiching the yellow and white parts of the boat together, instead of pulling them apart.",1470009853

Im not speaking about your trails specifically, but in my area, there are no dog parks so trails are the best place to go with me and my pup.

Unfortunately, I can't have him running around in the street or he will get hit by a car so trails are the safest place to go. Now I'm not trying to sound like an asshole, but it's public property. I can do what I please on that trail and so can anyone else for that matter as long as they aren't damaging the property. It's really unfortunate that your Father in law has a phobia of dogs, because honest to God, dogs are awesome. But the reality of the situation is this... you can't reasonably expect everyone else around you to conform to your (FIL) situation. That's not how life works. You and your FIL need to adapt to your situation at hand, not everyone else. It simply isn't our responsibility to do so cause it's not our life. Your Father in law has a phobia of dogs? Don't have him walk down trails that are known to have people walking their dogs and then get upset when there are dogs on the trail... It literally makes no sense what so ever. You dont see people with phobias to bees hanging near beehives, do you? Its not our responsibility to make sure dogs stay away from your father. Its your fathers responsibilty to stay away from dogs because that is HIS fear, not ours. Also, humans can basically walk anywhere we need to... walking isn't just confined to trails, if your father in law was serious about his health he would be walking around the neighborhood or if your out in the country there is a lot of open road to walk on.

# What

10 formas and 20 catalysts. I'm so close to have every single weapon in the game, that I'm seriously considering potatoing every single one of them. Also, need some formas because reasons.

# Why me

Because I'm a fucked up storyteller. Behold, a tribute to the old Void Survival !

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Along the troopers, there was four operatives in the ship, each one in a grey stealth suit emblazoned with the Steel Meridian sigil. The ship's arsenal was full of various weapons, but today, those operatives would only take a silenced Marelok and a Sheev. And a huge backpack.

&gt; The screen suddenly turned on, revealing the face of the Steel Meridian commander, Cressa Tal.

&gt; *""Alright boys, we're lucky today. We need some resources, so I hired a bunch of Tennos to distract whatever is wandering while we loot whatever we find. Don't be reckless, the Steel Meridian need you alive - so avoid everything that moves. Yeah, even Tennos. They tend to go a bit overboard with killing and stuff. You're warned. Anyway, I'll keep you informed, good luck !""*

&gt; The screen went dark again. The operatives were now quite uneasy. Tennos, really ? What kind of mission could require Tennos ?

&gt; Then the ship's back door opened, revealing a large hangar, devoid of any visible movement. But it wasn't a Grineer galleon or a Corpus treasure ship - this hangar was humongous, with burnished white walls and golden trims. An Orokin tower.

&gt; So that's *that* kind of mission.

&gt; The operatives scattered, each going in a different direction, while the troopers placed Blunts and portable Ramparts to defend the ship in case of lone enemies.

&gt; Cressa took a quick look at one of the monitoring screens, then pushed a button.    
&gt; *""Lotus ? Cressa here. We're in, unleash your Tennos.""*  
&gt; The Lotus' strange voice soon answered : *""Alright. The cell just set off the alarms.""*    
&gt; And then, it started.

&gt; The operative opened another crate.    
&gt; A bunch of control modules. Again. And to think that the Corpus sell them 10 plat a piece...  
&gt; Still good stuff. The control modules were soon dropped in the backpack, next to some Orokin cells, a bundle of ferrite, a couple of fusion cores, some weird looking purple rocks, and a blue paper-like thing with those Orokin letters all over it.

&gt; Another crate. More ferrite. Eh, there's no such thing as ""too much ferrite"" anyway. In the backpack.

&gt; Suddenly, the intercom buzzed.  
&gt; *""Cressa here. It's been a while, so the Tenn- The Lotus is asking about being paid. Use the handheld teleporter as usual, they've been set to their uh, orbiter something.""*  
&gt; The operative peeked in his backpack. The purple rocks should do the trick... Wait, where are they ?

&gt; THe whole backpack's content was on the floor. No trace of the purple rocks. They couldn't have vanished into thin air, that could be ridiculous. Well, let's give them the orokin cells then, no one in the Steel Meridian knew how to use them anyway.    
&gt; The small teleporter pad beeped to confirm that the cells were teleported successfully. The sound echoed through the empty corridors, contributing to the operative's nervousness - but this part of the Tower was still dead silent.

&gt; The heist continued.

&gt; The operative looked through the ventilation grid, and his heart missed a beat.  
&gt; The Tennos.  
&gt; They were four, each one in his own weird organic-looking armor they called warframe. The one at the left was holding a large Corpus machine gun, but didn't actively used it. She was instead using it as a support while reading an old Corpus magazine about Ospreys. And she didn't even ticked when the corrupted soldiers tried to attack her, because they suddenly burned to ashes as soon as they crossed the door.  
&gt; Two other Tennos were chatting and playing cards, sitting on the floor. One of them snapped her fingers, and the operative could see blue pulses of light coming from the door, along with distorded screams.  
&gt; The last Tenno was playing on a handheld device, sitting against the wall. He took a quick look at the door, grabbed the Grineer grenade launcher lying beside him with one hand and shot at the opened door. Unfortunately, the projectile bounced on the standing warframe's shoulder, who picked it in flight with a visible sigh and threw it through the door.

&gt; Suddenly, the operative's intercom buzzed again.  
&gt; *""Fourth payoff. You know what to do. Cressa, over.""*  
&gt; The teleported pad ready, the operative searched through his backpack. What could those things want ? Those weird jigsaw pieces ? The blue papers ? That would make no sense.  
&gt; There was still a bunch of spare fusion cores. Eh, let's hope the other operatives found some, those things are actually quite useful. He quickly put the five cores on the teleporter pad, hoping that the beep wouldn't alert the Tennos - but with the sheer volume of the screams coming from the door, it would be quite surprising.  
&gt; The pad beeped but got unnoticed as expected. The operative sorted out his backpack, and waited.  

&gt; A few seconds later, one of the cards player's intercom buzzed. The Tenno listened for a few seconds, then tossed her cards on the floor while the other player slowly lied down in what looked like a maniacal laughter.  
&gt; The one standing on her gun turned around, probably asking something. As the other answered, she threw her gun to the wall, angrily walked a bit, then picked up a huge axe and walked through the door.  
&gt; The last one just slowly stood up, and punched the wall so hard that it left a big dent.  

&gt; As the screams volume lowered, the operative could hear the laughing Tenno telling the other two :

&gt; *""Man, fuck those drop tables.""*",1470009853

Stuff to remember:

1. **Titles make the post.**  
 Good titles are critical to quality content.
 * Explicitly, the suggest title button is usually terrible.
    
2. **Do people want to see this?**  
Content isn't limited to what's in the suggested submissions list but it's good to go over it.

3. **Is this the original source?**  
Nobody wants to click a link and then click a video. Just link the video.

4. **Can I add value to this post?**  
Most posts benefit from a little elbow grease.
 1. 9 times out of 10 you should link the source, not the article.
 2. Videos are better when linked at the relevant time.
 3. Gifs are easier to enjoy than a video. [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/) has a convenient tool for making them.

If you're good with the conditions above, go ahead and post it on /r/StreetFighter using the link below.

Third, they shut down all the external websites and apps. With the tracking system broken, this was really the only reason to know where pokemon are. Especially the fact that they removed the tracking system at the same time they removed the tracking websites.

&gt; When you introduce more attractive partners, the people near the middle of the scale get pushed down towards the bottom.

This is true of men too. It's why inter sectionalism should cover working class men (when it doesn't particularly), and does cover black men, gay men, FTM transgender men, and disabled men. 

&gt; As a species we still managed to bang back when we were hairless apes with bad teeth and scars - hell, we wanted to bang, and we wanted to bang because our understanding of what was hot and what was not was defined by what was present.

A lot of people can get upset about what they might think is unfairness or moral flaw, including not winning something, having their input ignored, etc.., happens all the time, but ""getting upset"" can range from emotionally, to outspokenly, to violently, so the wording is vague. But I think that getting upset is not necessarily doing a bad thing, as long as it doesn't harm anyone, right?

&gt;and expecting good things to happen because you are a good person.

That can't really be said to be an immoral or bad action either, even though an unrealistic one, because the universe doesn't work that way.

But if we stick with the general guideline, everything might be great and all, if it did not only apply to 1% or of the people who find themselves on /r/niceguys.

One example I can offer you from this....""humor-based"" subreddit, is when another subreddit for lonely people was [mentioned in a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/4j6auf/this_is_what_people_think_about_us_and_our/) ( They screencapped the thread from /r/niceguys to showcase it ). Keep in mind, it's just a place for depressed ( As acknowledged by one of the user in the screenshot ) lonely people to get support from each other, not affiliated with any sort of ""bad behavior"". What happens next is that numerous top comments proceed to call all 40,000 subscribers of that subreddit ""high-maintenance pets"", ""pathetically needy high-maintenance pets with doglike obedience"", asking how a fedora will fit on a dog, saying that ""an animal will bring someone more joy than these manchildren"", and other gems distributed through the thread.

What infringement were the people of that [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/foreveralone) ( *And I'm linking so you can judge for yourself* ) guilty of, other than being mentioned as depressed and lonely, to be compared to dogs, pets, animals and called pathetic? You can tell from the insults themselves after all, that the posters of /r/niceguys did not even attempt to say they did something bad or wrong, other than being ""pathetic"". 

This is one example ( of thousands ) why I said that I don't think you visited that sub very extensively, and responded cynically to your assertion. Opinions?

Anyhow, while he was concentrating on Sanders, another corporate Democrat entered the primary race and now he is running at a deficit, because the other guy has basically unlimited funds.

I assume you have not because you are using an argument for the name of the Church that is only about 100 years old now. The original men who came together and began the idea of the Restoration movement called themselves several things, but mainly Disciples of Christ. 

One interesting thing is that we cannot truly know exactly how the earliest Christians worshipped by only reading scripture; we can know that it most likely mirrored the Synagogue initially. We also now know from the [Didache](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html) several practices of the Church in the late first or early second century. The Didache was mentioned by early Christians, but was not proven to exist until the late 19th century so it was not known to Alexander Campbell or Barton W Stone when they began speaking of unity.

The same is true for the main weapons on any ME ship.  Gotta point the whole dreadnought at the enemy to hit it.

If you're putting them on something then just go with a book shelf or a glass display case. 

If you are looking for something a little more fancy, and you want you to display them openly on things you create or buy then I suggest you choose something based off the game they come from. An example you used was a Warp Pipe. This could be used for Maro Characters. Then for the Pokemon Amiibos you could make open pokeballs. The retro three pack could be placed atop a SNES or N64. The Legend of Zelda Amiibos could be placed atop a Deku tree.

Maybe the insults don't help this game, they help for the next.

Flaming your enemy will give you either no response or a negative response which will reaffirm in your mind that it's their fault for not communicating or being selfish assholes. This centres you for the next game.

In some situations this might be a delusion, in others maybe not. Being able to separate your personal performance from the result and look at how to improve your game is difficult to achieve.

He sits and stares into the night sky, with no longing, no aspiration, no passion, and he finds comfort in his lack of lacking. He sees the world around him from his chair, and pities those with unquenchable desires, and even those with quenchable desires, as they will continue to long for more even if they don't see it yet. He accepts this inevitability, and gets off of his chair. He makes a decision that would change his life, as well as all those he knew and would soon know.

- Presupposition: Matter/energy is the only thing that exists
- Observation: Humans exist
- Conclusion: Humans must have been formed from matter/energy (ie spontaneous generation of life is true), no matter how improbable it may seem

Whereas an unbiased scientist or rational thinker thinks like this:

- Presupposition: Both natural (ie matter/energy) and supernatural things may exist
- Observation #1: Humans exist
- Observation #2: It is borderline impossible (statistically speaking) that human life occurred solely due to random interactions of matter and energy

"MUD","t5_2quk5","C &gt; C++ &gt; C#
in terms of baseline speed, a program written in C# is slower than the same one written in C++ which is slightly slower than the same one just written in C -- at least in theory. Most of the time this is true, rarely is it significantly violated

Does this mean C# can't be used for scalable, large applications? Hah! Hah! C# is used everywhere. Does this mean C is trash? Hell no. C is harder to build a scalable application with - it's essentially assembly - but it has its strengths.

Python can be fast (you need PyPy though). Is it faster than C? I'd say no. Does this mean your application is better if it's written in C? ...maybe? C has pretty big development costs and maintainability issues. Python has a lot of 'modern' time-saving built-in functionality. It's perfectly sane to say ""I want an OOP language that just lets me do room r = new room() and be done with it"". Interpreted languages can be faster than precompiled in some cases, thanks to JIT.

MUDs from time to time have performance issues. This has nothing to do with the language they're written in. It's almost always a bottleneck in IO or DB which is caused more by bad design than anything language specific. MUDs are can be complex games when designed that way, but they are nowhere near as complex as, say, some program ""loading 1 TB of data in half an hour."" or ""processing 1 million orders in ten seconds"" - speed isn't really a factor, most of the overhead is coming from common problems like network latency or ""how the hell do we make this game have a persistent state and still responsive""

The issue for me with old mud engines is... and can probably be boiled down to... too much code for what is in essence a very simple game model. Other issues exist - like the code simply being bad (hardcoded crap, bad assumptions) plus there are always bottlenecks and weird exploits that crop up as a part of bad design (usually in terms of how the game state is persisted) - usually fixing those issues are impossible without a total rewrite.

Maintainability is what you need for a MUD, not really speed. You want your players to get invested in your game world. And you in turn as the developer will invest in its creation. You can't afford to run into a crippling design problem - you don't want to make large refactors which could negatively effect player experience - that can kill populations. If you can't iterate on your game engine while it's live in-use, you're in trouble. Lots of games essentially get frozen in time, never updated because the maintainers are afraid to break something, and that leads to game stagnation.",1470009887

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","A lot of people think that the overall point of Corbyn's leadership is to shift the centre. Check out one of the top responses to the blog:
&gt;2. Corbyn has inspired hundreds of thousands in this country, particularly young people. We’re not all going to suddenly change our mind if the electorate don’t agree with us. This is a long-term thing, we know that. Many of us, if we’re being honest with ourselves, are well aware that the odds of Corbyn winning a GE are slim — HOWEVER, we just think winning a GE is not as important as building our movement and (slowly) turning the Left into a strong, political force.
3. The very fact that Corbyn is Leader of the Opposition means political discourse in this country has opened up — something that the media and the Tories have been trying to prevent for years. Suddenly, the Labour Party are trying to publically identify themselves as ‘socialists’ and the Tories are talking about social justice and workers on boards. This is a direct result of Corbyn. Politics is shifting because of him — in spite of the Establishment onslaught.

"virtualreality","t5_2qp9o","A simulator that has fast and precise motion (150+mm/s) will help reduce VR sickness, as it adds additional vestibule cues that reinforce your VR view.

Conversely while large axis movement sims may look impressive, if they are too slow then the mismatch between your visual and vestibule systems will increase the risk of feeling ill.

The collective DIY motion sim community experience is that the speed needed for good motion is 150-700mm/sec: http://www.xsimulator.net/community/faq/speed-needed-for-good-motion.218/

For motion simulation a base measurement for realism is related to how otoliths detect linear motion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_simulator

From Wikipedia the research on realistic motion simulation is that: ""Based on centrifuge experiments, threshold values of 0.0011 ft/s2 have been reported; values up to 0.4 ft/s2 have been reported based on airborne studies in the USSR"". Using the latter as the basis for a minimum simulator speed, 0.4 ft/s2 would equal 121.92mm/sec, so the DIY motion sim community experience does tend to reflect research as to the speed needed for good motion.

I am the mod who removed your posts, and flaired you for Hit-And-Run.

/r/NewTubers is open and we encourage all discourse! Our community is very important to us, and while I would normally not respond to this, I've had a couple other users approach me to ask why this happened, and if it was fair.

* Your [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/4v8a63/check_out_this_awesome_personchannel_please/) did not meet the very very simple rules for a ShoutOut. Because it's not a fellow NewTuber, it's the same as a plug link, and we don't allow blatant self-promotion.
* Your [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/4vimhw/dont_spill_your_coffee_with_my_brother/) was actually a **repost** of another thread that was removed earlier today. That earlier post was just a link, with no text, which you have since deleted.
* Several days ago you asked about the new changes, and when a fellow NewTuber directed you to the rules, this was [your response](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/4v234l/been_gonewth_happened/d5usme2).

I have linked directly to the thread, if they are deleted I will post images.

All together, I feel this is very fair, as you were notified of the rules, warned once, warned twice, then finally warned a third time and flaired with HNR. 

* You can still post here. 
* You are still able to be a member of the community. 
* You're not being silenced, as you can see by the fact that this thread is still here.
* I have upvoted this so others may comment.",1470009890

Such members must demonstrate clearly that they repudiate these apostate religious teachings before they may be issued a recommend.

Now, to be fair, the manual says that his parents were only supposed to repudiate their son's ""teachings"", whatever those might be.  But this question certainly applies to apostate groups.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","Eh... I enjoy standard less than wild. It's oversimplified and lacks all the crazy combo decks, all the really broken card interactions - its basically a neutered/simplified version of the game. Judging only based on what I've seen in the past, I think the dumber, simpler version of the game is where blizzard will focus 95% of their efforts going forward. It's where all the tournaments are, it's what you're required to play for points, and it frankly is less interesting every time I engage with it. No control except warrior, an entire metagame of curving out faster. Standard has the same flaws as arena, namely that it's a game of ""who hit their curve better?""

I don't have much desire to play that style, and so I've just been hitting rank 5 over and over, while spending the rest of my time in wild, since I have the card collection to support any and all exciting and wierd decks.

This game is manifestly not for people like me, who want to play crazy dreadsteeds or OTK decks, ancestor's call, control priest, control decks of any kind that aren't hunter... This game is for kids who want to play quick games without any ""unfairness"" except for of course the unfairness granted to the aggressor. So be aware blizzard isn't targeting this game at us at all. We who wish to play competitively, who wish to wield weird and wooly decks, we are not the target audience. 

It's ok though, as long as you recognize this. The other poster expressed themselves very poorly, but are you really going to argue their points are meritless? I watched the slow balancing of priest and paladin over 2 years, then the destruction of the classes' roles in this game, as blizzard nuked neutral taunts and healing and threw putthe baby with the boom/shredder/belcher bathwater. The game is poorer for the lack of those things, in my opinion, and thankfully there's no one telling me to ""go play another game"" when I'm tilted or maybe I would do just that, and leave the game with 1 fewer player who gives a damn. 

As is, this is a for funsies digital card game based around curving out and minion combat. We are the crazy ones trying to make it competitive. This game could be an amazing competitive online game, but it will never be that because this isn't Blizzard's plan. They want to make money, and for that, the game is simple and the most powerful cards are designed to promote the same ""minion combat with limited comebacks"" play style which appeals to filthy casuals. 

Anywho, don't tell people to quit when they're angry. They may take you up on it, and the community loses another player. ",1470009892

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","&gt; Okay here's a straight answer: To me, diversity means death. It means the death of a culture and of a society.

Well that's a really extreme opinion.

&gt; We can see this in active practice today in the decline of Western civilization.

This is just factually untrue. Western Civilization has always benefited from diversity. We see this with the Roman Empire, we see this with the Renaissance, and we see this with the incredible advances that we make in science and technology today. 

But let me ask you this: In what way do you feel that diversity itself contributes to the contemporary issues that we face?

&gt; Now mind you that is going against the hive mind and most certainly will not win you the scholarship

You're right, it wouldn't.

&gt; considering liberals

Presumptuous to assume they are liberal.

In my experience, the people who say this are most often the ones whose opinions can't be justified with a solid argument.

(1) Certain things cause crazy chunk updates, like auto tree/farming stuff. It's best to not have these things in a chunk full of stuff or in chunk update range at all. Try to figure out what you have that's forcing chunk updates and then ensure it's either in its own chunk or some remote location. Minecraft's code for chunk updates is garbage.

It likely wasn't magical crops itself causing the fps issue but instead harvesting those crops in an automated way. Also, sometimes when one chunk updates it forces ""connected"" chunks to update depending on what modded stuff you have going on between chunk boundaries. 

(2) Try /xu_killall (warning: will kill all non-player entities). For some reason I get a ton of butterflies in some spot that I can't see and this command kills them.

 I know that in my personal experience, I also have a guy who I have constant and never ending love for, yet because of the impossible nature of a relationship for us, I soothe my heartache over him with other fleeting and temporary relationships. Despite the fact that I can forget about him for the moments of complete involvement with the other men, as soon as they aren't physically present with me anymore, my mind just goes right back to him. When we come back together, he is my world. That never ends, even if our relationship keeps starting and ending. I never stop having affection and love for him, even if I've been with 5 other men besides him (and have platonically kept the company of many more than that). So what I'm saying is, she obviously has deep feelings for you.  I wouldn't question that, despite the horrendous feeling of knowing there are others besides you. That is awful, and I don't know how you deal with it.

This journey is her own to take. There probably isn't much you can do to get her into therapy or a diagnosis/treatment, but you could at least tell her everything you know about BPD, and suggest that she could have it. Before I knew it existed, I was in turmoil over myself and my ridiculous decisions. Now that I know what it is and that I have it, I'm at peace with my ridiculous decisions (and am making less of them every day, every week, every month...). I now know what I need from my relationships, and am on the road toward having only healthy and lasting relationships that serve me. None of this other self damaging garbage.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I'm not entirely getting your point? In general, religious assertions of a looming apocalypse have been largely tied to some ritualized understanding of what constituted ""signs of the times""--which were vague enough that any plague, famine, war, revolution, act of conquest, eclipse or blood moon might be cited as evidence of some sort of inevitable and destined end.

The anthropocene theory isn't quite like that at all. It doesn't rely on vague, ritualized signs, but rather on verifiable data dating back to the eras of enlightenment and industrialization. The problem being that the empirical approach to understanding these global issues is likewise easily passed off as signs of the times by those who would rather concede powerlessness in the face of a global dilemma.

But the mass extinction scenario theorized today isn't pre-destined in a religious manner per se. Where religion gives prognostications and predictions of a certain and inevitable end, coming at a fixed and unchangeable but unknown moment of time, environmental hypotheses give warnings: Fulfill x conditions and y negative thing will happen within z amount of time. x conditions are close to being fulfilled. To avoid that negative outcome (y), work to avoid fulfilling the necessary conditions (x).

It seems to be more the case that religion facilitates a way to explain away and avoid dealing with problems that are in the realm of human influence by conflating them with the sort of inevitable, divine doom that characterizes the religious conception of an apocalypse.",1470009902

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; Though admitedly the US does have a wee bit a violence problem compared to other western countries.

This isn't exactly true.

Inner-city areas in the US have a violence problem.  If you control the statistics to include only white Americans, the rate of violent crime is no different than Europe or Australia.  It's a little bit lower actually.

If you look at New York alone, something like 98% of illegal shootings were by blacks or latinos targeting blacks or latinos.  There is some controversy about these figures.  Mainly, these figures don't fit well into a popular narrative so they are discounted by some sectors of political ideology.  But the numbers are solid.

It's now possible to do this sort of analysis as the FBI has finally started to release its crime statistics with racial breakdown included whereas for the longest time they did not.

I bring it up only because it's an important issue.  If we pretend that the entire US has a crime problem, it distracts from the real issue and makes finding solutions to the real problem areas harder.  We owe it to the people being affected by these crimes to be honest in our assessment and in our suggested solutions.",1470009903
"psychology","t5_2qhcz","I definitely agree with you that as far as typical diseases go, addiction is highly irregular, however I don't think the debate is semantic.

That stereotype stigmatizes the disease and dissuades people from going public in hopes of getting the treatment they need. 

Even if someone truly believes that addiction is not a disease, is being right even more important than doing what we collectively can to right he wrongs of the past 20 years? ",1470009903

"MandelaEffect","t5_2zejk","Yeah, I'm not 100% sure on this but I could have sworn the north pole's arctic landmass was called Arctica because I could have sworn it was important to make a distinction between Artica and Antarctica, sort of how you make the distinction between stalactite and stalagmite. Even if it wasn't called anything like that I was almost sure there was something up there.

I will say that this confusion might be caused by the fact that a lot of maps show a patch of ice up there while other maps omit this because ice is technically not land... Even satellite images will corroberate this: http://i.imgur.com/EhkdcQg.jpg

But then you have other maps/images that show nothing but open sea: http://www.motherplanet.com/images/northpole.jpg

But what is even more curious to me is that there are images that are both satellite reproductions and actual photographs that appear to show what is a hole at the north pole, and in some images this hole is obviously edited out as a filled circle that is claimed to be ""missing satellite data."" Why would our satellites miss that particular area if we've had the ability to take pictures of our planet for decades now?

That's really the big mistake here, they introduce some cosmic horror(that doesn't really do anything or have any effect on the universe you're cruising through, anyhow. He might as well be cardboard cutout) and basically cast you as the big damn, one and only hero expected to fix the situation.

The whole premise would work much better if they'd give you and all other students the ship, the matter manipulator and immediately go ""Look kids, you're space cops now.

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","&gt;The information is out there. Watch it. Read it. Entertain the possibility that she is capable of malevolence.

I have. Until recently I honestly believed that the Democratic party had made a colossal mistake nominating Hillary. Then I began to investigate her career. It was easy to discard the obviously made up controversies from Whitewater to Benghazi. It seems that Clinton is the basis of a cottage industry devoted to defaming her and 99% of it is bogus. 

That only left the email scandal and that is bad. She made some stupid mistakes that bordered on criminal. James Comey rightly excoriated her and she deserved it. However he found that her mistakes were not criminal and I can live with his decision. 

So then it came down to examining her career through the lens of pure objectivity. I find that she was a great senator and an effective Secretary of State. In my opinion, these qualifications combined with her experience as FLOTUS makes her uniquely qualified to be president. Certainly miles ahead of Donald Trump.


We have different opinions. I do not dispute your decision was made after carefully examining the qualifications you found to be important. It seems that we live in different countries. I find Mr Trump to be lacking intellectually and he seems to me to be an unrepentant authoritarian narcissist. I could never vote for someone like him. 


Your decision to vote for him, while somewhat confusing to me, is your own. I respect that and I think I understand why so many agree with you. This country has gone through difficult times and we are all looking for solutions. Mr Trump offers his recipe and the Democrats offer theirs. The decision of the American people will have repercussions for a generation. ",1470009907

Then I got into dirt bikes with a friend, went out once a month or so and tore up the hills.  These were my airborne days. Didn't ride for 10 years until my brother in law had his bike stored in my garage and was too lazy to get it started and just left it.  I said if I get it started can I ride it, he said sure.  You know I got that bitch started, just needed a charge and some TLC.  Rode it for 2 summers, lots of close calls, dropped it once, and lightly rear ended an old lady, no damage. Still no MC license. Fast forward 20+ years, I got my license through the MSF course in 2011, been riding since.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Everyone thinks they pay too much, the only difference is that the rich can afford to pay a much higher percentage before being financially strained. When you live paycheck to paycheck, I imagine that taxes can leave you financially unstable for months. 

More importantly though, is the fact that it takes an exceptional person to bolster their resume, move up, and eventually land a rewarding career without any help (including things that benefit you from birth, such as a good education, financially and emotionally supportive family, a stable home life, health care etc.) This, I believe, is not something all people are capable of. If we had universal healthcare it may be more feasible, because it would remove some of the burden from mentally/physically disabled. 

A lot of rich people I know seem to have almost a social Darwinist view on this kind of thing, eventually conceding that SOME people might need help, but if they really care they'll do it anyway, neglecting to consider the possibility that some people can't care enough at the end of the day. They're too tired, and the only thing getting them through the day is the idea of lying down and watching shitty tv with their loved ones, or playing video games, or reading, whatever they love that they don't get to do for the majority of their adult lives.

Thru voice my friend says ""Aw man, I hate when people do that, it's so unnecessary."" And I point out the player who said that was on the other team, and clearly just being self-deprecating. :) We replied in match chat playing along and it made a kind of awkward situation much easier.

Back when they were beating us consistently in the playoffs I'd lump the Eagles in the conversation but I've since cooled on them. I think it's because of all the times I've watched Ronde run back that INT. Makes them less intimidating.

Also fuck the Patriots. And all Boston sports teams. It's a shame that Boston fans are the literal worst people because otherwise Boston might actually be a decent city.

"PipeTobacco","t5_2rbzz","I am very tempted to take the philosophical route here and attack the very idea of 'bad', then 'person', the 'idea', then 'existence' but it is hot and I am a touch hungover. 

I have a bm I go to a few times a year. They are literally 10 min away - by foot, nice guys, but they have limited selection and okay prices. Not terrible, the few times I have bought tins there - which was mostly for the reason of ""I like you and want to support you"" they were ~$15, which I think is fair. They are really a cigar store and sometimes I will buy a stick and smoke it there. But my needs are for the vast variety you can usually only find online, unless you live near one of those few remaining pipe store meccas. But I am getting off subject. So here is a further digression:

I went to Best Buy today, but didn't by anything. I went and played with a few items I wanted to see in real life. I would have stuck around and bought them, but the lines to get help seemed an hour long and it wasn't clear they even had what I wanted in stock. So I am going to by it online then. I tried to be a supportive customer, just like you, but it didn't work out, through the economics of time in my case, and money in your own. I want to feel bad, but I don't - this isn't 2006, everyone knows you have to compete with the globally accessible online community every single transaction. I know people who buy most of their groceries from Amazon now.

The one thing a b&amp;m can give you is excellent customer service, which is how they can compete even with higher prices, which is why I continue to overpay for tins down the street. But if the store isn't willing to be top notch face to face with every customer who comes through and can't match on price, they aren't going to be long for this world.",1470009914

A lot of the position players turned their years around and Beckham/Flowers may have had career years without injuries (although Beck's will be too few plate appearances) And he even had to deal with losing Mallex, Flowers, Viz falling off etc. The final result of this season was going to blow anyway, how is it possible to guage Snitker without the right personnel in place?

The 'attitude' thing is also a bit unspecific and fans dreaming of a perfect manager. How do we know for sure what their attitude is under Snitker or how the players are feeling?

**EDIT** Just to specify: How do we guage Snitker having 'losing attitude', if the roster isn't in a position to win,  yet a lot of these guys this year are defying expectations the past couple months.

"paradoxplaza","t5_2su3h","This was a Very Fun game and now i shall tell you some info on it.

I've always kind of Loved Bavaria so this was my first choice when playing the mod.

At the Start of the game I noticed that in this mod France was the worlds colonial overlord owning india and most of NA and also that Baden, Wurttenbur and other tiny states were Unsphered, I then took the chance to Annex wurttenburg for some quick Accepted Pops. The annexation of wurttenburg costed me some 18 infamy so i had to sit tight and wait for it to burn down untill i was able to safely justify on Baden.

After having almost all of the SGFs Territory i became a Great power and wallonia, The UK and poland(which is a pretty strong country in the mod) offered me alliances and i gladly accepted them.

After more waiting and encouraging soldiers in my states France surprised me by Declaring war, and that was the Start Of the French war of honor and their goal was to humiliate me.

The war was rather short, only lasting for 2 years and ending in an very satisfying victory to me + Alsace and Lorraine . Turns out the French had the Cannot the boat Syndrome and that's why not a single of their many Indian colonial armies saw the front line or even died in the war, after that they were pushover for the rest of the game.(Later they would DOW me yet again for Alsalce and lorraine and i would end Up taking French Comté from them too, later yet again they Would DOW me for cores and i ended up eating the rest of the french states that you can see in the final picture)

I then took my time to focus in the Future Colonization of africa by sphering all northern african states + Egypt. When the time to establish protectorates arrived Egypt  rebelled and my Sicilian Allies crushed them for me, France ended up taking most of Congo/ South Africa and the Brits took Everything from the deserts to Congo.

And after that not many remarkable things happened other than the french getting Fucked over by their desire to trow themselves at Bavarian Bayonets and later getting dismantled for it(Thats why i own parts of india and their south african/ congolese clonies(which i later released so i could worry less about creating troops that would rebel and make my stacks ugly))

Also Austria Exploded and i reaped the benefits of it first taking Bohemia/tirol/Kartern in a great war and later annexing the rest of the Austrian state (That was just Osterreich)

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I'm probably late to the party on this thread, but this has been bugging me a bit, so I had to post.

First off, I think Trump says some stupid stuff (obviously).  Him questioning whether the Khan's wife was allowed to speak or not was a pretty ridiculous thing to say (though it probably appeals to a certain demographic of people).

But I think the whole Khan thing is an underhanded political trick.  If they want to claim victim-hood, with everyone rushing to their defense because you ""can't criticize a Gold Star"" family, well, they should shut their mouths. If they want to talk crap about Trump - great all the power to them, he probably deserves it - but conversely, if trump wants to respond back, don't jump down his throat.  

Again, questioning whether the guys wife can speak is probably something worth jumping on, but I've seen reports saying Trump ""criticized"" the guy because he responded back that the guy (Khan) had no right to question whether or not he (Trump) had read the constitution.  

Answering a criticism against yourself is not a reverse criticism. I mean, that Khan dude's out there saying Trump has a black soul, etc... Again, having a dead son doesn't give you carte blanche to say whatever you want with the expectation that the person on the receiving end just has to eat it and move on.  Now, as a presidential candidate Trump should show some decorum in his responses (which he obviously struggles with), but him defending himself doesn't equate to him attacking the Khan's.

I think the whole thing is ridiculous, and is probably a very carefully played chess move on the Democrats part.  Use someone to attack the other side, where any defense on your enemies part is vilified because they are ""attacking"" a ""Gold Star Family"".  It's disgustingly brilliant, but should be a reminder that both sides are a bunch of dirty pool players, and we are all their suckers.  ",1470009917

"rawdenim","t5_2scl9","Can we talk about cuff openings and # of pairs of jeans you guys all own?

I'm debating on what to buy, and basically am seeing 3-4 main cuts that I'm deciding between:

1.  Straight fit - safe but a little baggy for me since I have very skinny legs / no butt.  Cuff opening seems to be in the 16-17"" range.

2.  Slim fit - closest to what I need, but the cuff openings for these seem to be closer to the 15-15.5"" range.

3.  Anything more tailored/skinny fit I'm not really interested in because they are so tight on the calf/leg opening.

My main question is - how do you deal with the narrow leg opening (14.5-15.5"") with your variety of shoes?  The narrow opening is fine for sneakers/loafers/etc, but for any kind of chukka boot, bigger boot, etc, the cuff just sits awkwardly on top of the shoe.

My dream pair of jeans would have:

- a skinny/slim seat
- slim but not skinny fit in the thigh and calf
- around a 15.75""-16"" leg opening
- a small amount of stretch would be nice (maybe 2% elastic or something)",1470009919

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSnapChat).

I suggest starting with a step by step official Unity tutorial (my cherry breaker was Space Shooter) line by line copying, despite not having a clue what is going on.  Then osmosis startes to kick in.  Then begin with the skeleton of a (maybe not YOUR, but A) game.  Maybe redo the tutorial, only to realize you're starting to understand basic concepts.
There's nothing like writing a bit of code on your own and seeing it work in the Game window of Unity.  I'm a bit of an evangelist on this point, that working on a game in Unity and tackling the coding in that context is extremely rewarding.",1470009922

I'd like to see footage from the snipers perspective, because when I'm in that exact scenario as a sniper, my reticle is bouncing and moving everywhere, if I manage to some somebody while that's happening, it's sheer luck. It doesn't matter how much you try to correct for the flinch, it doesn't help at all, it happens no matter what. What happens in the footage op provided happens to me every so often, but with no consistency whatsoever. When I challenge a sniper with a primary, I experience their shots whizzing by my head much much more than them domeing me. With the clips that op provided, I'd like to see all the times the sniper was not successful in domeing op in the same games. I'm not saying getting domed while under fire doesn't happen, because it does. It's happened to me and I've also been the sniper who has landed the headshot while under fire, all of which have been lucky shots that I can't make with any sort of consistency. 

I really think they should leave snipers as is because if they make it truly impossible to land a shot while under fire, then it just becomes a case of ""who ever fired first wins""",1470009924

Goddamn if he was right. That summer we bought literally no one, and the season after that was the beginning of the fall.  

We managed to win a Scudetto in 2011 because we had Thiago Silva and Nesta (only 6 goals conceded in the second half of the season) + Ibrahimovic, and then in summer 2012 all three of them left. Selling your two best players (Nesta was just old) shows a lot about your ambitions, combine that with Berlusconi+Galliani being unable to keep up with the times (property stadium for example), and the result is the shitstorm we've been having in the past 4 years.

They finish prepping her and start to take her back for the surgery. She says to her husband,  ""I love you. ""

John says ""I love you more, and everything's going to be just fine, I promise"". And they wheel her away. 

She wakes up later in recovery, looks around, and only sees her father. She says ""Where's John? ""

Her father looks at her with this very solemn sad expression, gets a tear in his eye, and says ""Sweetheart, who do you think gave you the heart? ""

She looks at him aghast, in shock, and says ""Oh my God no! How could he do that? How will I ever live without him???"" She starts crying hysterically.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","OK let's ignore all of the race stuff because we're going to end up talking around in circles. Why don't we take a look at some of the other batshit crazy things that Trump has proposed:

1. [He has said that he would pull the US out of the World Trade Organization](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/07/24/trump-threatens-to-pull-u-s-out-of-world-trade-organization/). This is a *horrible* idea, anyway you cut it, and it is something he would have the executive power to do as President.  The WTO is composed of 164 countries that combine to represent 97% of global trade and 97% of global GDP. There are 15 countries currently *not* in the WTO which include economic powerhouses like Somalia, South Sudan, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu and North Korea. 

2. [He has said that he would try to deal with the national debt by either refinancing or defaulting on it](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/may/16/closer-look-donald-trumps-comments-about-refinanci/). Failing that, he said that they can fix it by ""just printing more money"". 

Unfortunately the English language lacks the words to enable me to convey the monumental stupidity of any one of these ideas, but TL:DR - if you want to take the #1 greatest economic power in the world and turn it into a third world country, this is a pretty good way to go about doing it.

I will grant you that Donald Trump may actually be a successful businessman, although we don't really know because he won't release his tax returns. However, successfully running a company is completely different from running the world's largest national economy. The only skill that being a successful businessman demonstrates is that he knows how to make money for himself. And Donald Trump has repeatedly displayed a fundamental and profound ignorance about the basics of economics and the knowledge and skill that it would take to actually run a country. 

Ask yourself why a *lot* of prominent Republicans and businessmen are denouncing Trump. It's not just because he's ""anti-establishment"". It's because he would literally run the country into the ground.  [Conservative author PJ O'Rourke said when he reluctantly endorsed Clinton](http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/45920_Yes_PJ_ORourke_Endorsed_Hillary_Clinton_Today) - ""She's wrong about absolutely everything, but she's wrong within normal parameters.""",1470009926

"chess","t5_2qhr7","Learn relative piece value, Queen=9, Rook=5, Bishop=3, Knight=3, Pawn=1. When any piece attacks one of your pieces look to see if your piece is defended. if it isn't, do something about it. if any of your pieces are attacked by a lower value piece, then do something about it regardless if your piece is defended on not (you don't want to give up your queen for a pawn, or a rook for a knight for example). Likewise, you want to be threatening to take your opponent's pieces, force them to defend stuff, and if they fail too, take things. 

Obviously it gets far more complex than this, but as an absolute beginner, your primary objective is 2 things: Take the other guys stuff, and don't let them take your stuff. 

Once you can spot these one move threats reliably, it's time to look at simple endgames, (Rook+King vs. King, etc.) and start learning to identify 2 move threats, (things like discoveries, and forks, skewers/pins, etc.) 

Play a lot of games (try at least 15 minutes with a 10 second increment or more to start). When you do poorly, dropping pieces or whatever, take a look at the game afterwards and find your mistakes and see where you could have done better. Rinse and repeat, don't get discouraged, there's always someone worse than you and always someone better.  ",1470009927

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","I think for me, the biggest life change that has ever happened to me was being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when I was 13. I'm 33 now (about to be 34 next week), and it's had such a major impact on my life. Every day I have to pay attention to what I eat and take shots of insulin based on what I eat. Then there are extra shots to take because when I get stressed out my blood sugar rises. It's affected my vision. I almost died about 8 months after being diagnosed because I just decided I didn't want to take shots constantly anymore. I was in a coma, and apparently my doctor CRIED because he was convinced he wouldn't be able to save my life. 

I do my best with it everyday. Even though it can get really frustrating at times. You never get a day off from a chronic illness. You've got to do what you have to do no matter what. You have to stop everything to check your blood sugar and take shots. 

I will say that it has made me more empathetic towards people who have chronic illnesses. (I actually have more chronic illnesses but the diabetes was the first to hit). It breaks my heart when people are sick, even with just a cold or something. 

I don't always deal with it in the best manner. Sometimes I do just say ""fuck it"" and eat things I really shouldn't eat, but then I get massively ill because of it and realize I just CAN'T say ""fuck it"". 

I'm still dealing with it, and I will be dealing with it for the rest of my life. It's a part of who I am, but I am not a diabetic.. I am so much more than that. I just happen to have diabetes, and so I try to always remember that. ",1470009928

I'm planning to drive to Argentina eventually and love Mexico.

I was beat up pretty bad and robbed in TJ right when it got crappy a few years ago after Calderon did his war or whatever. It didn't make me not go anymore because the country is awesome and I love a ton about it but, it did make me more careful.

Anyway anybody driving down there who is a foreigner it's wise to only drive on highways at night, a couple Aussies just learned that the hard way a couple months ago and were killed in Sinaloa by some bandits dressed as police.

Saddam was seen as a threat to U.S. security long before George W. Bush took office, long before HRC voted to authorize force, and long before the post-9/11 media blitz that helped call America to war.

And we don't *have* to speculate on that. All of the states that seceded published declarations of secession stating their reasons in black and white (you should pardon the expression). And right up at the top of most of them was something to the effect of ""them damn Yankees want to take away our slaves, and we ain't having it!""

The notion that it was fought over tariffs, state's rights, or anything else, was nothing more than post-bellum retconning, when southern politicians had to get back into the US political scene, but couldn't keep going on about how slavery was a good thing. So they invented the state's rights thing to make it seem like they'd seceded over noble causes, but just lost. In reality, the ""right"" they were fighting for was slavery.

&gt;Again more reason to not have gender use the same words as sexual classification.

In medical usage, gender = the sex of the brain.

&gt;What is wrong with calling that how it is?

Because that's not how it is. Sure, two unmodified cis men cannot sexually reproduce. Trans people in gay relationships help makeup the two sets of reproductive organs, allowing them to reproduce. That doesn't make them female any more than implanting a uterus into a cis guy does.

I got distracted procrastinating making a scientific poster, and someone on twitter was talking about ""semi-permanent"" tattoos. So I looked them up. Turns out that semi-permanent tattoos don't exist. The closest thing is henna, which lasts max 2-3 weeks. But there was research a while ago into microencapsulation of tattoo ink! I don't know where the research is at now, but they were looking at putting biodegradable ink inside microbeads. The microbeads would burst when hit with a very specific laser wavelength, then the body would clean up the ink - so the tattoo would be permanent, but much easier to remove than the current tattoos! 

Procrastinating again during election week (Australian), I used Excel to pull data from the Australian Electoral Commission website, and calculate certain percentages that would tell me the progress of each electorate at counting their polling place votes.

I still put the same amount of time in but at 56 I find myself just doing scroll groups and working on failstacks (grunil or heve) . When I accidently +15 the item, I grab grade 3 armor stones from my Altinova refinery, upgrade the armor, and sell on AH (usually 25 mill). Also I sell my memory fragments from relic groups and profit 10-35 mill depending on the luck of the bundle. I don't need them at the moment so this is also anecdotal. 

168/188 GS and I'm not exhausted at all

On a long enough time line rng and derivative engines both output the same results, it's all about what your goal is. Play for fun, not to have a bigger e-peen than the 13 yr old down the street

What about the rest? If one of (what you believe, based on very little information, is) the minority of judges, then your client is screwed.

A lawyer I used to work for told me (several times) about a judge he clerked for who had a policy that if any criminal defendant took a case to trial and was found guilty, he *always* got the maximum sentence, mitigating factors be damned.

3. I recommend not getting a 970. Get an rx 480 or 1060 instead since the 970 is an older gen and at that price it is a poor choice. I personally use a thermaltake rbg mechanical keyboard with brown switches and a cheap mouse. A good monitor is great to have.

I'm kind of losing hope that we're even going to be able to clinch a playoff berth this year.  bright spots were de Jong's strong performance and Seiler seemed quite comfortable out there which was encouraging to see.  The poor showings were undoubtedly Morales who looked lazy out there, not dropping back on the left wing leaving de Jong holding the bag, while not generating much going forward.  Also Hurtado, why even bother bringing this guy onto the pitch anymore?  The only positive he contributed was drawing a free-kick near goal.  Finally, Waston has been super inconsistent this year and that 2nd goal is a prime example, he just lets his man get away from him.  but anyways hopefully Barnes can give us some more attacking threat but I'm kind of resigning myself to this team being cold for the rest of the season.

No sweat, I am a US citizen, as it happens.  I appreciate the thoughts, though of course that isn't why most of us who serve do it.

&gt; The nerve on you in your attempt to take away the man-child moniker I have fought so hard for!

I know, right?  :D

&gt; Back to being serious...&lt;snipped&gt;
&gt; I once thought that being content was a curse. It's been nothing but a blessing to me.
&gt;I realize that may sound like the words of a quitter to some, but again...two shits.

No, I absolutely agree.  The issue isn't that we'll never become anything of note, but that the message is we are somehow *entitled* to success and that if you aren't ""the best"" then there's no point in trying.  Heck, by the very nature of it, most folks simply can't be the best at any particular thing!  It's something many struggle with and a major reason why so many young adults are unable to cope when they are thrown to the wolves of the real world instead of remaining coddled in the nest.  It's sad, more than anything else.

More importantly, what we need to be doing is teaching people that being a productive member of society is sufficient in and of itself to be confident and OK with who and what you are.  As far as dating goes, I was fortunate enough early on to have someone sweet enough to teach me that it isn't about what others see which makes me attractive but how I see myself that is important.  It sounds like Zen BS, but it's very true.

&gt; I just like to call myself a man-child because self deprecation feels so much better than one upping all the time.

And that's fair enough.  I didn't mean to entirely derail the thread for that, but I've seen it here and there and it's something which any community can benefit from a short discussion of here and there.

&gt; Gaming makes me happy. I enjoy being transported into another world for a few hours of the day. It's really no different than a movie or a book.

Exactly.  It's more engaging, as well, and with a few exceptions actually has benefits aside from keeping us entertained.  Elderly folks who play games (or any sort, video or not) tend to live longer and are happier than those who simply sit around.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","You're getting a lot of great advice here, so rather than retread over what everyone's already saying, I'll just point out that, especially at the lower tiers, a lot of people assume that all Specialists should be solo laning. Actually, there are a lot of Assassins and Tanks (and even Supports) who are great solo laners, whereas a lot of Specialists (especially Sylvanas and Sgt. Hammer) can do a *lot* more damage with a buddy in their lane.

Like, a lot of Specialists are specifically designed to be great solo laners, or even to rotate between two lanes. But a lot of them are not, so don't just assume that the Specialist should go alone.

The main thing you want in a solo laner is first self-sustain - whether someone that heals themselves like Thrall, shields themselves like Chen, or at the very least, has solid escapes like Valla - then waveclear. Waveclear is nice, and important, but self-sustain is far more important in a solo-laner.

"AirCraftPorn","t5_2snyy","I don't think there ever was a Ki-90, and the Ki-100 was a single-seat fighter aircraft and so nothing like the picture. 'Ki' was a serially-assigned designation number which didn't have anything to do with the plane type, mission or manufacturer, so saying ""Ki-90 series"" is meaningless...Ki-92 was to be a heavy transport aircraft, for example, not a bomber interceptor. 

Anyway, pedanticism aside, you are obviously referring to the Ki-96 and it's relative, the Ki-102. The trait shared is that they all have two engines on the wings but that's about it. Those Japanese interceptors have very narrow fuselages, wide enough for the pilot and gunner to sit in tandem, whereas the aircraft in the photo is clearly a bit chunky and has room for side-by-side seating. Additionally, the pictured aircraft has a twin tail (bit hard to see, but it's there), while the interceptors had a conventional empennage.  

I will say that I rather enjoyed those Japanese heavy fighters in Warthunder and even got the Ki-102, which I think was a premium. I liked a lot of the non&amp;ndash;go-to airplanes in that game, which was kind of sad because they typically performed well below par vis-a-vis other planes, and thus frequently got the shit beat out of them in game.",1470009951

I love to watch: RomCom Animes (Fav is: Ouran Highschool Host Club), Apocalypse-type shows such as Nuclear, Virus, etc, and I love cheesy chick-flicks. However, I can't say no to Sci-fi/Action Movies. 

Gaming: Basically I own a Nintendo DS, Gamecube, Wii-U and a SNES that still works. My favorite game of all time is the Sims because I really enjoy creating people and houses. My 2nd fav game of all time is Animal Crossing. I have Steam but haven't exactly wanted to play anything lately. 

Music: Honestly anything I don't mind. But I love dancing to EDM, Enjoy trying to rap along with rappers and sing my heart out to Rock music (70's-80's).

"news","t5_2qh3l","It's not a gamble if you're expecting it anyway. Better to have it happen when you're ready for it.

It's been speculated that they had insiders reporting on the operation, and that they could also have provided false info to make the plotters think they had more support in the military than they really did. Also, the fact that the majority of soldiers deployed in the coup didn't actually engage in any fighting and said that they thought it was just an exercise suggests to me that Erdogan operatives were in control of that deployment, and that it was undertaken to give the illusion that the coup had massive support.

In other words, there's not much risk if it was really just a small plot with little support, but the fallout is that a full-scale coup is now no longer even a possibility.

edit: With regard to killing Erdogan, he was out of the country, and possibly not even at the hotel he was thought to be staying at. And the two fighter pilots who had missile lock on him also behaved as if it was just an exercise, or perhaps were knowingly involved in creating a fiction that Erdogan was at risk. In any case, Erdogan's explanation for why they didn't fire their missiles has been thoroughly debunked.",1470009953

I did a lot of reading, so the lack of technology didn't exactly delay my coming out. In fact, I was willing to give it a chance that it might have been just a phase. I still don't relate to many gay YouTubers because their advice and way of life had a lot of first-world assumptions while my upbringing was in the third.


Having said that, this sub definitely helped. I got to make some friends whom I'm in touch with one-to-one and can talk about things that other gay men can relate to. I don't think I've completely accepted myself yet, because there isn't a prototype or model for me to follow and also because I've never been in a relationship.

It would definitely change the in-app economy. If suddenly 200 Vintage Han's flooded the market (Or actually, it would be slower the way I view this happening) people would freak. This can be done so many different ways. 1k packs for 1 card. 100k for 10 cards and a promised insert. Or if they ever incorporate the level system that is in other apps, you could claim a ""Vault"" pack for free.

The thing is... Topps ""owns"" these cards. I am by no means a legal scholar, but I am sure that they could do this pretty easily. It may upset some people but it would also allow some people the opportunity to grab some of these cards. I am not saying I am for or against it, but I can see it.

And if someone did come back... Idk. If the ""vault"" had all their cards, they revert back. Or they get vault packs.

The cashier hit the assistance button and continued to ring up the next person. When that person was finished the transaction, still no manager assistance and no change, so my dad started yelling, ""My milk is getting warm. My milk is warm because you have lousy customer service. I just need my 61 cents!"" 

Everyone was looking at him. The lady behind us leaned over to me and asked if she should give him 61 cents. I explained he really wouldn't take it. He believes in good customer service and will call people out for below his standard. 

Finally, when a manager called out, ""Sir, you have to wait."" We asked nicely if she could give us 61 cents from her register, so we could be on our merry way. ""Then my register would be short. You have to wait,"" she said. They got into a 15 minute argument about how he should have been helped and the lady shouldn't have been ignoring him. In the end we got our 61 cents and never went to Safeway again. Now, every time I hear a change amount in the 60s I just crack up laughing.",1470009961

&gt;the point for where you ask what my point is, is that Luffy did not inherit Ace's will like you said. He inherited Roger's, Sabo inherited Ace's... thought that was pretty obvious.

No, since it has zero logic. Sabo is a revolutionary. It's shown he's always been idealistic. Ace wants to get rid of his father's shadow by making WB PK. Now, if Ace lived on, it's either him or WB, no? Then WHO gets the will? LUFFY, that's who. ",1470009961

"cowboys","t5_2re7g","Re-signing guys you draft who turn out to be All Pros isn't how you wreck your cap. Missing on numerous draft picks and being forced into signing high priced free agents is how you kill your cap (and your roster depth btw). 

We also have to keep in mind that when Martin, Frederick, and Collins are big hits against the cap in a few years, we'll have other up and comers at other positions who are playing on rookie deals. We would be in that position now if guys like Gregory, Claiborne, and Escobar, had lived up to their potential. They didn't, so we ended up splurging on Hardy, Carr, and McClain in order to cover their lack of production. As long as we draft RKGs who aren't total busts, we'll be able to keep all our offensive line talent and still build a competitive team each year. That's how all the best franchises stay the best franchises. ",1470009968
"headphones","t5_2rcyx","How much depends on the exact model you have, i.e. its impedance response, but you will definitely benefit from it.

While amplifiers **also** make things louder, the main point is to provide more full and clear sound and to fully serve the headphones with what they need to get to their true potential in terms of wattage and voltage - for example, my K712s are known to be quite hard to drive, but I could blast my head off with them via onboard easily. Getting an amp has helped them smoothen out significantly, get quite a lot more and clear of a punch in the low end and overall warmed up and refined the sound signature.

Similar things go for the HD600s and D5000s.

Basically, what you can expect from an amp would be a better separation of sounds, more punch in the low end, more detail in the highs.. you get the idea. More defined, detailed and full sound. How much of which, that depends on the headphones, but the DT series generally benefit from it quite a bit.

I'd recommend you go for something like a Schiit Magni 2 (Uber, if you want to stick around in the hobby and go higher later), since while an E10k will do for, say, the 80 ohm version, it won't hold up all that well beyond it, and really, you'll just get more value from a dedicated amp anyway. Unless you are having static issues on high volumes, there's not much of a reason to getting a combo unit right now, and focusing on a straight amp will do you better.",1470009968

QUOTE OF THE DAY: 

&gt;Quran 5:32

&gt;http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=5&amp;verse=32

&gt;Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land – it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one – it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.

**THE VERY NEXT VERSE**

&gt;Quran 5:33

&gt;http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=5&amp;verse=33

&gt;Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be **killed or crucified** or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,",1470009970

"Robopon","t5_30xl5","Train never dies until it enhances. then it's really vulnerable for like 6-8 battles until its stats catch up, then it's nice and bulky until the very end game when every other step is a team two Jordans who have Blizz hate on it. I don't remember Soul being particularly bulky but Jordan only ever really dies when the team gets caught off guard and she has to deal with multiple physical attacks in the same turn or something like that. She's nice and bulky.

I put the Sunny and GigaPon lines in basically the same category. Both good, both balanced, just really good, above average 'pons. Nothing spectacular about either one of them, really.

SunZero never dies though. He's just exceptional from beginning to end.

Both Boot type starters are really nice and bulky too, although they do level very slowly.

EDIT: That said though, the first thing you do in any town should be visiting the parts shop and getting a new part for everyone in your party. It's basically a free 3-5 levels for every Robopon, it's really not something you can skip even in a speed run. Obvious exception is boot types, but the lack of part is what makes most of them so awful in the first place. If you're going for speed and only speed, start with Draco or Hexbot, get Crysty from the FT, spark a Viggy and Mouster for the first arc. Viggy can get away with only using a MagSword until it enhances, and then it's a boot type so doesn't need a part. When you get to the 2nd arc, replace Crysty with a Sumito. She stops being useful quickly and Yokomo learns Kiss :) and Revive so he can be your healer in the long run. Mouster learns Electric at Lv 30 so he's a huge help in the 3rd arc, but I'd replace him with an Elepon in the 4th arc.

Things like planting C4 on soldiers, or jettisoning vehicles through the air work effortlessly.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was actually thinking about this topic the other day. Back in my high school football days (for those that have played), we did a lot of sprints.. like **a lot**. So meanwhile I'm a 5'4"" lineman but I was surprisingly fast and athletic for someone of my stature; I was also about 260+lbs. The seniors liked me at the time, pretty much everyone did actually do it was a fun season. One day we're doing sidelines sprints and we're on maybe the 8th or 9th and everyone's really struggling here, both the ""skill"" positions (everyone but linemen), and the trenchmen (linemen). I'm one of those who run on willpower a lot and I never like to quit or give up so somehow someway I kept going through with these sprints and one of my friends on the team who was a senior at the time chuckled and said to me as I made it back to the sideline ""one day you're gonna be jacked."" Now at the time I'm just like yea whatever (remember I'm short and real big). For some reasons I never forgot what he said; it's not like it was some life changing advice or revealing of some information I was searching for, but I've still not forgotten what he said to me 9 years ago. Fast forward 9 years and now, I'm all about working out, being in the gym, playing sports, being active when my much skinnier friends are not; it's like an addiction. These are the times I remember what he said because although I'm not *jacked* jacked I'm now more muscular and stronger than I've ever been and in the best shape of my life with a goal to lose even more fat and get more lean. I guess you can say even though what he said was something as a nonchalant statement that I brushed off, it clearly had an effect on me because he's pretty much right now.

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","**Ike** Zihark is cool, and I do think his backstory is actually very good but I never really cared much for him, probably because I had Eddie instead. Ike, however, is amazing and one of the best lords in the series (I only like Leif more) and...yeah, sorry Zihark. 

**Shinon** I feel like a lot of sorries will happen as I have to vote against characters I reall like. I think Shinon is an asshole character done right. He's surpsingly deep when you think about it and has great supports with others especially Rolf.

**Pelleas** This is another one of the really top characters. Volke is good for backstory and helping in the whole Renning situation (but that's mostly Bastian) but Pelleas just brings so much more. 

**Sephiran** As said before, Sephiran is fantastic, one of the better written villains in FE. Haar is great, but his awesome boss convos can't make up for...well everything that Sephiran has.

**Ashnard** A surprisingly good enemy character. Initially you might just think he's yet another generic evil guy, but actually think about it. His vision is not a bad one, he believes the powerful should rule...it's similar to Ike's view, it's exactly how the laguz nations (except for Goldoa) rule. 

**Sanaki** Really, Rolf lost to Marcia? :( Sigh, well I hope Sanaki wins against her now. Sanaki develops into a whole new person, from this little brat into a maturing young ruler. She is very young and gives off a very sour initial impression, but she deals with everything very maturely in the end. 

**Edward** Very pleasantly surprised that /u/estrangedeskimo and /u/theRealTJones both also voted Eddie. Especially since poor Eddie is losing massively right now. I think Eddie is a clearer and better character than most think, but again I just really like him and so I prefer him over Titania. 

**Tibarn** Same reasons before for Tibarn, in comparison Devdan is quite sweet but... he feels like he was made as a bit of a joke. That and Tibarn is great just makes it an easy win for Tibarn really. ",1470009975

Personally when I'm lacking inspiration, I hit up Pinterest and pin some recipes that sound yummy and aren't too finnicky to make. When meal planning I try to be realistic with my expectations of myself. (For example I go through phases where I try to make myself like yogurt, because its so quick and healthy to have for a breakfast.

Getting rid of gut fat is some of the hardest to get rid of. And yes, to get rid of it you will need to be eating properly as well. Start looking into a diet that counts everything like your carbs/fats/proteins. (keep track in your head like you do calories, or write them down if it gets confusing).

Example: I was with a girl for six years. We broke up, I was a wreck. Nobody else involved. Quite quickly we began chatting again and it looked like we might get back together, which I wanted at the time, only I couldn't not tell her I'd had a drunken one night stand when we were split up and I was in a bad place. So I did tell her, and I felt lots better about it, only she didn't see it the same way, and we never did get back together and it took me sometime to get over that.

Make sure that you think about insulation though, only the tightness of the actual wire matters, so you want thin insulation. 

It also goes up with current, so if you put more voltage across the inductor you should get a stronger magnetic field.

- find a good Chinese Medicine doctor(try Yelp) and go for a consultation, sounds like your health is not well as your energy is not stable. Maybe the doctor is nice and tell you lifestyle changes with some herbs for you, and you can learn more about Buddhism to improve the mind.

I *can* say that leveling is not an issue AT ALL. If you do anything besides the story on tython you will get 12 EASILY. If you do the exploration missions you'll leave the planet at 15-18. 


Look at screenshots for graphics, but I still think the game looks beautiful. Not battlefront, but still beautiful. 

Also, the DvL event gives you that xp boost armor, so after the first toon getting levels is stupid easy. You're almost always going to be above the level cap. If you do the PvP intro at 10 and the daily (1 if you win, 2 if you lose) you'll probably get 5- 7 lvls depending on bonuses and boosts just by turning those in.


In case you don't know, each planet caps you (so tython makes you 12 max, even if you go there as a 65). This makes it so higher levels don't walk around and one shot everything in case you power level and do the story later. ",1470009981

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Way too late and this is gonna get buried, but I was having trouble with anxiety and depression, particularly letting one bad thing spoil a day, a week, whatever...  So my therapist dropped some next level shit on me. 

She took out a chess set, set the chess set in the table, and told me to pick up a white piece and think of something good that had gone on or that I'd thought recently.  I said something, then I put it down on the board.   Picked up a black piece, and thought of something shitty, and set it up on the opposite side of the board. 

This went on until I started to get sick of her Mr Miyagi type shit.  She sensed I was getting impatient and stopped me, looked at the board, roughly the same number if white and black pieces, maybe a few more black pieces.   She asked me to point out, in this little set up we've got going here, where I am.   I, being in a shitty stubborn mood, insisted I was way among the black pieces and couldn't make it over to the light side. 

She paused, told me I was wrong and said ""no, you're the board.""   and then my mind imploded.  There's good and bad going on inside all the time, and there's room for it all.  It's not entirely good or entirely bad.  You just gotta make sure you pay attention to all the pieces to keep it balanced.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;The issue with health care and education would be solved through private donations, which are better than government spending since they don't go through bureaucracy. Also, donations increase when taxes are lowered, and people would have more incentive to help the poor themselves as opposed to letting the government do everything for them.

First of all, the idea that private donations don't go through bureaucracy is ludicrous. As someone who works in the non-profit sector I can tell you that is just straight out false, and the degree of wasted time, effort, and money in private charity is just as high as in the case of government if not more so. Its just talked about less by demagogues.

Secondly, yes private donations increase as taxes are lowered, but they also decrease when the economy is faltering. Which just happens to be the time when private donations are needed the most. Its not that people have more incentive to help the poor when taxes are lowered, its that they have more money to do so with if they so choose. However, there is no reason that they have to do so and they won't if they have the slightest hint that it will negatively impact their own standard of living, whether justified or not.

Edit:

&gt;after journals publish the details of some environmental damage, people will vote with their wallets and not buy from that firm anymore. 

First of all, who is funding, publishing, and distributing these studies? How do we know that they are true? How do we know that the scientists haven't been bought out by the firms?

Secondly, voting with your wallet only works if there are options to choose from and they are of relatively the same cost. If Company X can produce and sell a widget for $3 by destroying the environment, whereas Company Y does not destroy the environment but has to sell widgets for $10 to stay afloat, then its much less likely Company X will NOT go out of  business even with the public somehow all knowing they are fucking up the environment.

"RotMG","t5_2s505","I think the crystal sword is pretty good. It's easy to obtain, which is great for new players who play melee classes. Its DPS isn't so bad if you account for the damage you avoid from its range boost.

Since people's pets have become to great, where high-end players don't even care to dodge projectiles anymore, I think it could use a little damage buff just to make it more viable.

About this suggestion you are making, it's pretty awful. Sorry for being to crude, but your damage is overpowered for such a long range, and the sprite looks like it was done in 5 minutes without any color coordination. You copied the mithril dagger's blade, which only looks good because it's small, and made a ugly brown handle to go with it.

I recommend you look at highly-praised artists, and take in some ideas from them. Most of my inspiration came from Uomo's sprite sheets he released a long time ago. Some of his sprites are even used in the game, such as the reaper divine pet.

Find colors that go well with each other, and create your sprites from nothing. Having different designed blades or hilts make a sword look a lot more appealing.

Hypocrisy requires intent to deceive, or more particularly to pretend to a character one does not possess. I do not see how Landeskog is doing this at all.

You are also wrong that ""all players apologize in these situations."" Many do not (see Andy Sutton) or offer only equivocal statements that express regret that a player was hurt while asserting that nothing wrong was done (see Matt Cooke, Mike Richards, etc.) In this case, Landeskog acknowledges wrongdoing *and* expresses remorse, while merely denying that he did it with malice aforethought.",1470009986

And yeah, I also remember that bit about no attachments in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. So, what, is it perfectly alright to just have the Jedi Masters and Jedi Padawans act like Albert Wesker towards S.T.A.R.S. and probably anyone who placed trust in him (ie, backstab them)? Because that's effectively what Yoda seemed to imply regarding the Jedi having no attachments. And anyways, it's funny how they conveniently ignored that rule against attachments when it came down to plotting to use Anakin Skywalker to spy on Supreme Chancellor Palpatine under the pretense of safeguarding the Republic (something even Obi-Wan Kenobi, who wasn't innocent of planning it, realized was a supremely stupid idea regarding using Anakin, someone prone to act on impulse), especially when Mace Windu implied that they chose that method specifically to sabotage Anakin's friendship with Palpatine to ensure only the Jedi had total control over their ""chosen one."" And honestly, I know monastic orders like that of the Catholic Church often forbid the use of attachments, but even THEY don't outright forbid love or passion at all, though they do exercise caution regarding it, unlike the Jedi, who seem to think even the slightest concern over someone is somehow a start regarding falling to the Dark Side. And what's worse, Kenobi implied that the Jedi were a bunch of moral relativists at the very least, and at worst were utter nihilists when he told Vader ""only a Sith deals in absolutes.""",1470009987

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","&gt;Trance: Smite evil, Precise Strike, etc all add similar if not more damage and far more repeatable. 10 minute sated period is probably better than 1d4. That's a good change.

This is the one that sticks out the most in my opinion. Everything except smite evil does not give you to hit bonuses and smite evil is very restrictive when it comes to targeting and uses per day. I must admit, when comparing it at lower levels (1-8), trance does look pretty bad actually, but once you can reach the 100 damage in one full attack, it is insane.

For the other things, if enchanted quiver does not give quickdraw but the handy haversack feature it needs some wording clarification. Signature Shot, if you only get one ever, this looks very lame and is going to be one that increases your damage for the turns you are restricted to a standard action. I'd make this something along the lines of 1 every 4 or 5 levels. Magical Tracking is actually good, but so annoying to track. ""Oh I spellcrafted a spell from him, so I get +2 to save, no wait I tracked him for 2 rounds so I get +4, oh no it was 3 rounds, so I get +2..."". Also, can you do this more than once a round, gaining +2 to all saves as long as you make the spellcraft check? If yes, this ability is even more annoying than I thought. I don't need to roll spellcraft to identify the fireball he just threw at us, but with this, I have to. Elemental Arrows are fine, just a bit much with trance added on top. My big problem with Imbue arrow is that this should be the signature class feature of the arcane archer. Why would I pick this over ranged Inquisitor/Fighter? Spells. Do I get an amount of spells that makes this worth your time? No. Then we have Mystic Wolf, which just comes out of nowhere. Oh, I just leveled up and check it out, I can turn into a fast wolf now! Why? Don't know, I just can! *repeatedly turns into wolf and back out again*. The class just doesn't have an ability that makes me go ""Yeah, I wanna play this!"". It is a bunch of features tacked together to form a semi-working package that has one ability I think is broken (trance) and a bunch of random stuff. Compare it to the Bloodrager, the other class that got 4th level casting on the barbarian base. They give up the d12 hit die and rage powers for 4th level casting and bloodline powers, which seems like a much fairer trade. 

Also: Arrowsong Minstrel Bard Archetype. Gets Imbue Arrows (sort of) as spellstrike at level 6, has 6th level casting, only 3/4 BAB but counts as full bab for combat feats, so it basically does everything your AA does - just less damage focused and more on the caster side of things. I fear that the archetype makes this class obsolete...",1470009988

But hey, he's been that way since he came in the league, and he's been wildly inconsistent. I don't think this is a ""make or break"" year for him; I just think if he has another year like he's had, maybe it's another indication he'll have a career more akin to ""not dominant, but good"" than the Saints-era Jimmy Graham type everyone expects him to be.

Technically you're supposed to park in the designated spaces (except at Wiehle, where you can park anywhere that isn't reserved) but I've parked elsewhere nearby for 3-4 days when the long-term was full and never been towed. As for a station without long-term parking, IDK, just drive to one of those stations.

And in such a situation, as long as you remove your car on a weekend, it's free. There have been times where I parked my car on a Thursday afternoon, took the Metro to Union Station, hopped on Amtrak to somewhere or another, came back Sunday, and left without paying for parking. Had I stayed in the garage for four hours instead of four days, I would have had to pay. 

It's Metro. Don't expect it to make sense.

Edit: Also, overnight parking is allowed anywhere (other than explicitly short-term spaces). It's parking for more than 24 hours that isn't allowed.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Bruce Lee wins it. He was a real martial artist and even had a couple of fights. He even influenced MMA quite a bit. His raw striking power and speed incredible, with numerous feats to back them up.  

A wolf is slightly above dog in intelligence. One wolf bite with 5X the strength of humans is enough brake bone. A wolf's running speed is high at  25 to 35 mph, but there actual attacking speed is much lower than what Bruce Lee has. Skull dimensions, overall size, fur color, and the length of appendages are some of the characteristics that differ between subspecies of gray wolf.

R1: Bruce Lee has been in many  physical confrontations (some on his terms some not), and is well disciplined. He isn't going to panic, and should be able to fight at full strengthen and optimumcy.  Wolves will chase a fleeing prey, but rarely chase someone who is intimidating it. While always a life threatening endeavor, many documented cases have shown, all-around average people killing a wolf, during an attack . Wolves have several weakness, trained professionals can exploit to consistently take down a wolf. Given Bruce Lee's background, we should assume he can learn these easily, and execute them. Bruce Lee wins. 

R2: Bruce Lee has shown pin-point accuracy with Nunchucks (even able to play ping-pong with them). He is man who made the weapon popular, and is a master of it. Unarmed he could ""grab a coin out of your Hand, and replace it with another coin"", and strength wise, ""he was too strong for a heavy bad"" and could literally send people flying. A Nunchuck now multiple's that. One blow to a wolf, **will** be enough to incapacitate it.  Lee will be smart enough to move against a wall and limit there attack options. Wolves preferred method of attack is to chase it's foe(s) down, then circle around them, and wait for an opening to attack and begin a second chase. They do not all charge and attack at once. That would be a mess, with them all trying to attack at the same time. Unexpectedly Bruce Lee wins.",1470009990

It seems obvious to have label-mates on your project, but I think Schoolboy wanted to further cement his own identity. He wanted to prove he doesn't need the TDE crutch. If he had Kendrick drop a feature verse on *Blank Face LP*, how many comments would be ""OMG THAT KENDRICK VERSE THO""? Similarly, I think Noname wanted to be the star of her own project, rather than having a conversation centered around a Chance verse.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","The two main GPU manufactures, Nvidia and AMD have technologies that allow two GPUs to work on the same task. For Nvidia, it's called ""SLI"" and for AMD, it's called ""Crossfire"".

**SLI** requires an *SLI bridge* that physically  connects the two graphics cards. The GPUs in the cards must be the same. For example, you could SLI a GTX 970 with a GTX 970, but not a GTX 970 and GTX 980. Board partner doesn't matter; you can mix cards from MSI, EVGA, etc...

**Crossfire** does not use a physical bridge (though it used to, old cards will need it). The cards communicate through the PCIe slots. The GPU mixing works better, I know an R9 390 and R9 290 will work. I *believe* any AMD GPU will crossfire with any other, but please someone correct me if I'm wrong.

When you connect cards with SLI or Crossfire, you plug all monitors into the top card. **Important!** It's better to get **one, powerful card** rather than two weaker cards. You'll use less power, create less heat, and generally have less issues. These technologies aren't perfect.",1470009993

Then progress to some light rubbing, then insertion etc. It may take some time, but gently easing yourself into it, with no one to push you farther than you want, will psychologically allow yourself to get used to anal play, without feeling rushed or pressured, which may allow you to avoid a panic attack.

**Part one- things that are probably nessecary for a good relationship**

We enjoy each other's company

We share similar values

We are on the same page with wanting kids

We both find the other attractive

I love her dearly

**Part two**

I decided she was the one. What I mean by that is, a lot of people go into marriage hoping it's going to work out. Some even get a prenuptial agreement; literally planning the end before they even start. When things get difficult, it's like ""We gave it a shot, but 
maybe we aren't right for each other."" I don't like that mindset. My wife knows that I'm not going anywhere. It doesn't matter how difficult our relationship is, I love her enough to make it better instead of looking for someone better. ",1470009999

Mifflin-St Jeor is the formula that is used by [that calculator](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm).

I agree that this is overdone here.

It has to be slow enough to be safe and these numbers seem to provide that..  

It's also hard for someone to stay motivated to start if they sense it will take forever -- it has to be fast enough for motivation long enough for them to realize that they do actually have positive control over their weight.

I really am a huge fanatic on focusing on the smaller details to make the bigger picture to become a success. Lets implement the concept of AC3 economy and his ability to use the very currency to rebuild your assassins empire and assassin dens and main assassin guilds and factions. That will improve the rarity of the game and the benefit of working hard to accumulate currency so u can have a ton and i do mean a ton of different things that u can use the currency for like even building horse stables for your chariots if we putting them in the game and setting of egypt as u get up higher in the ranks of the creed. Also to use the materials u gain to help build the economy back up as well as helping your allies with materials to help build them to help the relationship between you all good and flawless so your economy can thrive besides whats an economy without allies or enemies. Example: We may need a certain amount of stone and wood to build this faction or building just like ac3 and even having the slaves u freed give them jobs to work within your empire and build the economy as well as u can see the economy of AC3 was the best ever to me because it was something new, vibrant, live and very fun to enjoy u really felt u were improving throughout the game and making a true difference for the people in the console. You all could have never ever implemented a better, personal and in depth economy as that one....It never got boring it kept me and my friends focused so please have this added.Using the currency to improve not just your gear but your fellow cpu assassins gear in the game to be more dependable for use when sent out on missions and hopefully having the recruiting enhanced so we can start developing the assassins u recruit to have limited spots of master assassins and they will have a certain amount of currency &amp; look to represent them specifically for they assigned den/guild/faction/fort/ and may have to borrow from the main house of the assassins empire that your slowly building up. I have so many great ideas but those are just a few!!!!!!!!! AC3 ECONOMY IS THE BEST PLEASE INCLUDE IT WITH THE BLACK FLAG AND YOU HAVE A WINNER!!!!!! The economy simply should be based on buying goods/trading/food/clothing/materials like stone,wood,sand,rope,gold,silver,bronze,metal,water, ect..... As well for getting different size boats for travel,horses,even different type of chariots as u grow into your empire. Attire for your assassins and different materials to represent the different ranks of your assassins as we recruit and build up the creed (Ex): Regular assassin the typical basic colors of the creed but the master assassin have the ability to wear silver in the attire while you being and is a developing grandmaster assassin gets to wear Gold of course to represent the best. Economy should have supply and demand type of features and ability to trade with your allies or neutral folk. Now Alil about syndicate economic it was good i like the way your able to spread out the currency to focus more on the gangs of the rooks and help buy and increase their abilities to help the creed in general implement that as well.",1470010002

They also changed the charge finisher in striker style only to be much more powerful.

With how fast you can build up the art meter in striker style you can rely on the 2 evasion arts to be up pretty much constantly.

"TEFL","t5_2qq76","I've known a few black friends teaching in China.

It's certainly doable, but you need to be aware of the challenges. If you prove yourself nobody will care about your skin color, but unfortunately it means you have to break that barrier Chinese people have about it.

Once you do, you are golden, at least to the school and students that know you. You will still face many weird questions and assumptions about your color, but there are a lot of black folks doing just fine here.

I reluctantly will recommend checking out [Loser Laowai](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-G09c97zEqc9BNfVRNO3JQ)'s channel. There is a ton of information about living in China as a black person but I am reluctant because I feel he obsessed a bit too much about being black in China and about Chinese perceptions.

I'm not black, so my judgment about that may be off, but I can tell you as someone who worked with a black guy that had too much of a complex about race... it can be detrimental. The guy I worked with always thought people were insulting him. I personally witnessed him misinterpreting what Chinese people were saying so many times and had to keep him in check. Even somebody talking about a black ""hei"" handbag would trigger him into thinking he was being talked about.

tl;dr No the minimum requirement to teach in China is not to be white, but you should be a native speaker. China is getting much tougher about the language ability of teachers. Sure you can get a job as a non-native speaker but it's probably gonna be a shitty one you don't want.",1470010007

"battlebots","t5_2ts52","The embedded video shows the last 35s of the fight against Disk O' Inferno. There are 4 attempted hits:

* the first one at 11s, can't see if it's a hit or miss because of the flames (not a big fan of those)
* 26s, the arm of the hammer and not the head hits Disk O' Inferno's flipper (although it looks like it was initially on target but it got hit by Disk O' just before swinging)
* 29s, the flames partially obscure the view again, but this one is definitely a direct hit
* 32s, miss

The hit rate is pretty good since a hammerbot is tricky to aim manually as well, but I'm not sure if 4 attempts in 35s of pretty close contact are *laughably* better than manual weapon firing.

Like in many control problems, the challenge here seems to be latency. On the one hand, there's going to be some latency between movement happening, the LIDAR registering it, and the processing system getting the data and being able to act on it. Then there's the latency between triggering the hammer and the hammer physically swinging to the front of the bot. Because of this latency, the automated system must use some sort of model to predict the behavior of the opponent for this duration and essentially make decisions based on what it thinks it's going to happen in the future and not based on the input it's sensing right now. Auto targeting wise, you can see that around the 3s to 4s mark, where Chomp's orientation lags behind Disk O.  IMO it's this where Chomp needs some improvement and it's not an easy task.

In any case, I'm pretty happy to see some innovation towards semi-autonomy.

Because I'm in a band, a crap-tonne of my Facebook friends are also in bands or are promoters, so I get a shedload of event invites.

A couple years ago, if I had an empty Friday/Saturday, I'd look at my event invites on Facebook, find the ones that were vaguely (in a couple of hours) near to me, pick one that looked fun, coerce a friend into going with me, and go. 

I met loads of awesome people, made good connections, and usually had a really good time.

Now, my friends who I used to coerce into going with me a) moved really far away b) got into a relationship that means he doesn't go out. My husband isn't always super-keen on coming if he doesn't at least have some awareness of who's playing. Also, I'm a bit older and staying in with a six-pack and the SkyBox or going to the local with some friends is just...more appealing a lot of the time.

I do still sometimes go to shows on my own if I'm not gigging (and usually run into someone I at least vaguely know to hang out with) but it's not as much fun.

"Neverwinter","t5_2sn0p","If you have an alt that isn't in a guild, try to get a guild for him. A guild bank tab starts at, I think, 100k AD, which is cheaper than buying most any bag.  It can hold any unbound stuff that you want to keep.

If you have the Zen and want to play more than 1 character then get the Dragonborn pack.  When you redeem it on each character they get a dragon hoard bag that has 30 or so slots in it, which is cheaper than buying a runic bag for each of them.

You get a few small quest reward bags and a stronghold starter pack, if you choose to buy one, has a runic bag with it.  Never buy anything without a coupon (15% off any item, for example).  Events sometimes have better coupons and every few months the zen market has decent deals.

You can also mail yourself items and I don't remember the mail limit off the top of my head but it should be enough for when you are starting out and not sure if you want to keep an item or not.

Elaborating, it's specifically about how Clinton would have had to have run against Biden. 

Clinton resigned from the administration in 2013 precisely so she would have the ability to run in 2016. Her tenure was relatively positive, and the four year gap would give her enough time to choose whether to run on Obama's record or against it. If Obama ended up being popular, she'd endorse his record and say she was always there to support him. But if things went bad, she'd be able to say she wasn't there when things soured.

With Biden in the race, Clinton would have been forced to have run against Obama's record significantly, because Biden has a much better claim on being a policy heir, having been in the administration eight years. She bailed out, so every good things that happened since then can't be attributed to her, but rather Obama and Biden.

So Clinton would need to have distinguished herself by finding ways to criticise Biden, and the only way to do that is to attack Obama. We see hints of this in her flip flop on the TPP. I think it's obvious pandering to Berniecrats and hardhat Democrats and that she has less than zero intent to interfere with it. 

If she had run against Biden, take her treatment of the TPP and expand it to other signature Obama items: the Iran deal, normalizing relations with Cuba, perhaps even the ACA.",1470010013

"Competitiveoverwatch","t5_34fcy","Some flaws with your argument:

* The first kill on attack happens for two reasons - the picking player is good or the picking player got lucky.  If he is good, he will kill more often than his teammates throughout the match and his contribution will be reflected in the stats.  If he is just lucky, no reason he should be awarded more MMR.  

* The 50 kills from the McCree ain't gonna make themselves.  You always are taking a risk when you try to kill you enemies but you have to take that risk.  Sometimes the risk turns into reality and you die.  And you don't know whether he is actually losing less MMR because he got 50 kills.  If the average McCree at that rank kills 50, too, then he is not going to lose less MMR because of the kills.  If the average McCree at that rank in similar circumstances kills 25, then yes, the 50 kill McCree **should** lose less MMR because the rest of the team sucked and did not contribute.

* Just because you think something can't be done doesn't mean it actually can't.  I can list a bunch of scientific nonsense here or we can cut to the chase and just agree on the fact that people who studied for years in school, got phds, and then worked in a specific field for years can do amazing things with the data generated by the competitive play in the first season.  I'm not saying that Blizz actually invested that much manpower in the game but there is no reason to dismiss them out of hand.  ",1470010016

I don't mean to be a negative nancy, but this may come across that way. If so, I apologise. You add a lot to this subreddit, and know your stuff. I highly appreciate your posts, but I don't think you've approached this issue well.

You found an issue you have with the endgame. Maps get too grindy when you try for progression.

You seem to have jumped on the first conclusion you came across, without thinking it through. I assume this because you've barely sketched any details out, for example,  you don't have any well-defined challenge ideas. 

The result to me seems crude, to be blunt. It seems to be a very binary issue, map bonus either affects maps too or it doesn't. The thread itself doesn't seem to be about fixing the grindy map farming issue, but rather your specific solution to it. Bearing in mind that there's not an extreme amount of creative space directly related to the map bonus,The OP doesn't seem to encourage innovation, but rather discussion on the proposed idea as it stood.

So, when you talk about ""improving the yay"", I'll admit to some surprise.

Honestly, there's a number ways to tackle it. Don't make me farm map stacks every new zone just so I can run more maps. My favourite idea would be far more simple. A perk that adds % damage on maps. 

Finally, a suggestion for the challenge. I'd like to see variations for this. My original thought was maps evolving, each time you run a map, they get harder, but I fear that'd play out pretty much the same as resourceful. As such, I'd like to see a combination of nom and balance, where your trimps gain attack but lose hp for every map you run, enemies heal x% on every hit. ",1470010016

"tifu","t5_2to41","This is part of the reason you never leave the pump unattended.  Here in the United States it is frequently posted at every gas pump.  In addition to the dangers of overfilling your tank, you also have the added danger of ignition (both in the moment, and while the spilled gas is still on the ground).  The auto-shutoff valve relies on pressure to trigger (most pumps have a second hose inside the main one to measure pressure or something.  Someone else can explain the mechanism better than I).  It is really easy for either the pump, the vehicle, or an error as simple as being inserted partially or rotated to cause this mechanism to fail.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","Lalla Ward has continued to play Romana in the audios for almost 16 years now, and her character's development after her original departure has been going on for 22 years.  I'm not sure how she'd feel about wiping all of that out just to return to the show.  If that were the case, I imagine they'd probably just bring in a new actor (they'd probably do that either way anyway).

I know that the BBC has rules about making sure their programmes don't require you to purchase extra material to understand the story, but they could probably get around the detailed history of the character in this instance very easily.  Just saying that she left E-Space and became President before the Time War should be enough to catch people up.  They didn't explain everything that happened to the Master after the TV Movie when they brought him back in *Utopia*.  They just said that he was resurrected for the Time War.  As long as the script doesn't explicitly have Romana saying something like ""I just left E-Space for the first time,"" then it'd be pretty easy for the show to keep in line with those aspects of the books' and audios' continuity.",1470010018
"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","I'm pretty high on Dez too. You're not alone. I'm taking him at #6 in my draft. yes, it's a reach I know, but I think he'll be best available at that spot and I won't see him in the 2nd.

I'm looking at 2014 stats bc of the health and other issues. 2015 is an outlier in Dez's otherwise fantastic fantasy years. The running game should be very good next season. Zeek is an excellent pass blocker too. Romo is a little injury prone yes but his fragility is over blown. I'm not worried.

But on to Dez. He catches ball. period. Tds are hard to predict but Dez has consistently been among the best WRs the last few seasons with TDs. That pass attack comes through him and he's savage as hell in the red zone. I think he's pretty pissed off after last season (and while that's a dumb thing to project performance off of, I think Dez is one of the few players that gets that extra drive in the situation). I think if not for last seasons stats he wouldn't be getting slept on as much.

Green is fantastic too, and his situation did improve. One knock against green though is Eiffert as a RZ target. Dalton LOVES to throw it to Eiffert in the RZ. So while AJ's volume will go way up, I think his TD volume stays the same (10 last season, still very good). 

I understand why this sub is higher on AJ, but I rank them near interchangeably. I'm drafting Dez most likely bc I think the Cowboys produce more offense as a whole so it gives Dez a slightly higher ceiling. ",1470010018

Test it for yourself if you don't believe me. Genji's ""Deflect"" is like a reinhardt shield that covers about 180 degrees on the front of his model. It only extends a little bit away from his ""front"".. So, if you flashbang at your own feet, it won't interact with his deflect model, and it will stun him.

In any case, you shouldn't try flashing him until after he deflects, as he can't do any damage to you while he deflects anyway. I find the best time to flashbang him is right after he uses a Swift Strike. ",1470010023

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Well it's more like fast then eat freely. You might binge initially but most people eventually eat mostly normal. Typically fast days end up being about 25% of normal and free days end up being 110-120% maintenance. It averages out to ~30% deficit but you don't have to maintain constant discipline/willpower for months of eating like a monk.

Relaxing is always only a day away, you don't have to refuse cake at a party, and you can always switch it up for events. Either go low two days in a row which will NOT put you into any ""starvation mode"" or eat normal twice in a row and don't worry about it.

Hunger is a normal physical response. Most people are not used to it in 1st world countries. It's mildly annoying for the first couple times, but after that it's easy. I'd recommend one big meal or that and a small snack on fast days. Don't try to have three 170 calorie meals or you are likely to feel unsatisfied on fast days. Also, don't have your big meal for breakfast. I usually have a snack for lunch and a good dinner. Otherwise i find it hard to fall asleep when hungry. 

It's known as the Every Other Day diet or a version of intermittent fasting. There are other protocols, 5:2, or the warrior diet, etc. ",1470010023

On Earth, there's a lot of atmosphere. Enough to make air-launched orbital rockets make sense, and enough for this stupid balloon idea to work. [It's called a Rockoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockoon), and it's been done before. Not to orbit, and not to mars, though.

So, this kickstarter will never happen, but it's not because rockoons are a terrible idea.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","Nah. I used to be on Grindr too and it was basically the same. It happens frequently on dating apps: either you're extremely hot or you're more likely to be ignored. That's mostly because people get demanding and selective when they are shown a large amount of guys. They fall for the most good-looking ones and ignore any other, and so on, that's why nobody really gets laid/starts dating.

When a shell strikes armour, it ""digs into"" the armour and angles inwards a little, which essentially means the armour is treated as less angled for the penetration calculation.

For example, if a shell with 8 degrees of normalisation strikes a plate angled at 60 degrees, the angle is lessened to 52 degrees for the calculation, which means the shell has less effective armour to travel through. In WoWS this is especially relevant against angled ships and ships that have angled armour decks such as low tier protected cruisers and Tirpitz.",1470010028

"Disney_Infinity","t5_2w2eu","The key date for you to remember is March 3, 2017. On this date, all online features will be no longer accessible. This includes:

-all online multiplayer. This affects Takeover, Speedway, Arcade and every area of The Toybox (self-made Toyboxes, The Toy Box Hub, INteriors and the various Halls of Heroes). To clarify, you'll still be able to access all of these---just not with friends online.

-leaderboards

-all Community Content. This menu will not be accessible and means you cannot share or download any Toyboxes.

-the Text Creator may not function properly

The lack of online features will make it impossible to earn multiple feats. By my count it affects 8: Three of them are tied to the El Capitan Theatre,  another 3 are tied to Flynn's Arcade and there are two feats that require a 4-player session of Speedway and Takeover, respectively.

It is true that another notable shutdown date occurs earlier: September 30th, 2016. As as a console gamer, though, all this means is Disney will no longer accept Tor review Toyboxes from users.

This following point is important: all three Disney Infinity games can be updated to their most recent versions even AFTER March 3, 2017. The data is retained by the first parties (Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo) so as long as they're up and running, you can download the updates. This means, yes, you'll be able to play as Time and Alice later.

However, as someone already mentioned, it would be best to update your games sooner rather than later to get the most out of them.

Not a chance: the exact opposite is the truth.

Warren ran in one of the most expensive senate races in history, and is the 5th highest senate fundraiser (beaten by Clinton, Clinton's opponent, and two rich people that self-funded). She ran against a surprisingly popular incumbent who started off [consistently ahead in the polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Massachusetts,_2012#Polling_3). Scott Brown actually had [a job approval rating over 50% just before election day.](http://constructionlitmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sen_scott_browns_job_approval_2.html)

Beating an incumbent that the voters approve of is never easy, regardless of the partisan makeup of the state or district. Despite that, she slowly ground out a convincing victory despite never having run for office before. She was absolutely not a ""very poor"" campaigner.",1470010036

From which sources did you learn this information? Who wrote these sources? When did they write them? Why do you find the authors credible?

Do you have a good reason to believe that the apostles were martyred for their beliefs? If so, can you share it?

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","I would love to see it in Poland, I think the UFC could make this a Fight Pass event while striking a good deal with European TV to get this broadcast live. They could treat the event like a promo tool for FP, ""only $10 for a title fight"" similar to Alvarez/RDA.

If anything UFC should be delighted about the match up, right now it's hard to sell JJ vs anyone, even Rose, but Pole vs Pole is a good angle to work with. JJ will only ever be a co-main on a PPV but UFC could potentially sell that PPV easier using a title eliminator as the co-main instead.

Writing off her title defence as a promo tool is probably the the most lucrative move for the UFC. Have a Fight Night card in Poland but with a belt on the line. Market it right, make Fight Pass fans feel blessed for getting a title fight. Poland card will sell out even if Daniel Omielanczuk was the main event, seriously. It's another strawweight title fight taken care off without needing to logistically bundle it in a PPV.

As I mentioned though, European cards will always sell out so filling seats will never be an issue. With that said, 204 being in Manchester, UFC probably have the sales set low for that one given everyone is likely to get 205. JJ v KK could slot as a co-main on that very easily as 204 will sell what is sells, their addition will neither generate more or less sales and its another strawweight title fight taken care of.
The Eastern Euro aspect of having it at Manchester kinda works but we honestly don't need an incentive over here to go to a UFC event.

UFC Dublin sold out with a Duffy/Porier headliner for fuck sake, which as you know ended up with Holohan and Smolka headlining.

If 10 weeks is too short notice for KK, then UFC could make them the Prelim headliner or the Main Card opener of 205. It's an event that should sell well, putting them on there can only add to the tagline of ""2/3 belts on the line at 205"" regardless of the actual belts that are being defended.",1470010041

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","For a lot of experienced players, yeah, it feels about as frustrating. I think that, for a lot of newer players, though, they don't like the long drawn out factor of ""you technically aren't dead yet, so you have to stay in the game, but you're never ACTUALLY going to win."" It's a combination of both the inevitable nature of it and a newer player not understanding the invisible factors that go into that inevitability. By comparison, on Turn 3/4 to a red deck with a perfect draw, newer players immediately understand ""I'm dead, I just lost"".

Basically, think about the game in a way where you are never allowed to concede. That's how a lot of new or even mid level players feel about the game. Now think about the difference of that scenario where you genuinely lost on turn 3 vs you technically already lost the game on turn 3, but you have to play the game out for another 10+ turns while the other player goes to find their win condition.

Ultimately, I think the perfect scenario is where players recognize when they've actually just lost and learn how to concede early, but you can't fight human nature that easily. I mean, just the other day, I had to play out a Mindslaver lock on an opponent in Vintage Cube because he had an Ulamog in play and refused to believe me when I said ""I have Sheoldred in my deck, you can't block forever.""

"metalgearsolid","t5_2s4hr","Your statement makes no sense. TPP plays like a more refined GZ. I mean seriously, if there is ANYTHING in this game that's near flawless, it is the controls and execution of the gameplay in between the story here. That is where it deviates the most from previous Metal Gear games. 

Also for those saying TPP isn't a proper ""Metal Gear"" game, stop typing for a moment and ask yourself the following question...

""Are you playing it like a Metal Gear game?"" 

Because if you aren't, you should know that you absolutely can. So, if you wanna go through the whole game sneaking around in a box, stuffing guards into dumpsters while never being seen, and carrying minimal equipment, nothing is stopping you. Just turn off reflex mode and leave your buddies behind on the chopper. 

I'll go so far as to say that the best thing about the way this game series evolved with TPP was that it didn't discard anything about the previous titles. It just made it ""a way to play,"" instead of ""THE way to play.""

At no point (outside of boss fights, which have always been like this in a Metal Gear game), are you ever forced to play any particular way.",1470010051

They might get people to agree, but they usually don't make them comfortable.

Your best bet for a genuine, long-term, happy relationship with him is probably to try to make him more comfortable with the things that bother him. If he's open to it, work with him on things like:

* Coming to terms with the previous bad experience

* Understanding what polyamory means to you and why he can (NOT should) feel secure with your feelings/desires for others

* General relationship trust (that if you, say, spend time alone with someone you have a mutual attraction with, you won't suddenly turn into someone who doesn't care about your relationship agreements)

* What polyamory can offer him, both in your relationship, and in his life as a whole

Ok. Good. We're making progress and you're admitting some things you weren't before. You qualify it at the end with ""completely sincerely"" though, which, ultimately, takes away from the qualification itself. ""Completely sincerely"" is what, to you? Here's what you're saying when we get down to brass tacks: you're trying to say that *all* voters for the next, say, *20, 50, 100 years* are going to devolve and vote for *only one candidate no matter what?* Even if we only have 10% of the population being ""completely sincere"" it is *still a better system than what we have now.* That's giving you a *huge* benefit of the doubt. That's *you* having so little faith and/or appreciation for your fellow humans that it's, actually, quite disappointing and sad.

All this would be fine if the companies were regulated like traditional online gambling websites, but they are not. They have little or no checks that the user is over 18 and do not have any accreditation process or higher authority that they answer to. Unfortunately, this is a result of legislation being slow to catch up to new technology (and understandably so, as you wouldn't want to spend millions setting up a governing body to police skins gambling if it's a fad that will go away in a few years).",1470010054

Regardless of whether commercial airlines are ""technically"" allowed to request permission to fly over Yokota airspace, the fact is that there is congestion in the airspace around the block as a result of practically all airlines flying around it.

which at any respectable shop will mean that you're going to get bounced in the short term or end up doing to least meaningful of meaningful work. so now you've invested in (1) taking an FE exam purely so you can take (2) the patent bar and (3) going to lawschool so you can get a very unsatisfying and likely exceptionally low paying job?

If you want to work with technology, stop wasting time on this plan and go get a usable undergraduate degree to work in the field.

Arguing he's not a Muslim is even thinner since both his parents are Muslim and he grew up in an 'secular Muslim' household. He wasn't really a neo-nazi either, he was just a loser. 


Of course this doesn't touch on the fact that all of the other recent attacks were commited by Muslims, most of whom openly declared support for ISIS and screamed Allahu Akbar as they killed.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","TLDR: Poor planning on someone else's part does not constitute an emergency on YOURS.


A piece of advice since this is happening everywhere now:

Make sure you put in your vacation time well in advance. When manager tries to reschedule or cancel you, you have rights. Everyone is someone's child, just as your coworkers have children now. Maybe your own parents need help with something (yes, lie your ass off, who will know?) After all, if Mombie didn't think her precious snowflakes' back to school wasn't important enough to plan ahead, why should that affect YOUR mombie? After all, you scheduled time off to 'bond' with her months ago...and mombie has a million back to school days in her future, how much time will YOUR mother have? After all, if your own mother isn't important, then what is the point of mombie taking time off and investing it in her kids now (like your mom did xp), if there's no payoff later?

Or, be honest. Their poor planning has nothing to do with you. They had ALL SUMMER to do this. More than half of my kids back to school shopping is done. There's only a few school supplies left and a few clothes, but they have enough to get them through the first few days, barring shoes. So screw those parents who were too lazy to think ahead and have to rush now.

I think this is a significant factor that a bunch of us learn after first year. Although it may seem logical to tell yourself the best way to transition is to devote all your time to school, you end up tiring yourself out -- it turns into a lot of low-quality studying, instead of a reasonable amount of effective studying. By doing things outside of school work, you're giving your brain some time to breath, which I found to be incredibly important in both raising my grades and mental health at university.",1470010067

I don't think a person that points out virtue signaling will come off as virtuous, quite the opposite in fact.

I think you are missing the point. People that engage in actual virtue signaling do not actually believe in what they are saying, they are merely saying things that they believe will score them social brownie points. Example: "" I would host refugee families permanently in my home"", or ""Caitlyn Jenner is stunning and brave"".

There is no real point in arguing against these positions, because they are not sincere statements to begin with, nice words that someone can say, that they don't ever have to live up to, but that will serve to raise their social standing, hence ""virtue signaling"".",1470010067

"gamedesign","t5_2qimq","If you're willing to argue that in this case Niantic doesn't owe the players an explanation then do you also agree that the players who are getting refunds for their IAPs from Google and Apple are also correct? The core way that they played the game now no longer exists and they can't use the items they purchased in the way they intended anymore, so if Niantic isn't responsible to communicate why they are changing things then they are also not entitled to the money from players who paid for the app and had it changed less than a month after launch.  

Honestly people keep using F2P as a shield for developers saying ""well you didn't *have* to give them money, so they don't owe you anything"". And while you're technically right, they're not legally obligated to do anything it's not only probably in their best interest personally since it'll net them a much happier community but I would argue they *are* morally obligated to provide an explanation.  Their game was the top grossing application less than a week after launch. Whether they like it or not there are consumer protection laws in many of the places that they launched. Since they have taken in so much money they have a lot of eyes on them now and most of those places favor customers far more than corporations. Even if they don't *owe* players now, they may literally owe players if they get taken to court.   

And no, that isn't just blowing smoke, this is (slightly) similar to the Blizzard/WoW/Nostralius thing. People were making the argument that since WoW was no longer available in the state that people had paid for that they could play the game on private servers (and some went so far as to claim that if they couldn't then their purchase of the game should be refunded by Blizzard). Now it wasn't total nonsense but Blizzard is exonerated by the fact that Vanilla WoW isn't considered abandonware because they gave large amounts of warnings when things were being changed or removed for upcoming expansions and how the game would change. Niantic didn't give any forewarning to these changes which puts them on rockier footing. The EU has already placed plenty of rules on mobile games and applications and looks pretty ready to push harder if they feel they need to, Niantic doesn't want to be that tipping point.",1470010067

They get 2 days a month to do their job.. Are you really going to remember what to do if you have a technical MOS? No. 90% of your time as a reservist will likely be spent doing stupid hours long power point presentations, rifle range, PFT, CFT, or other dumb annual requirement shit.

This is the honest truth, based on 5+ years of babysitting reservists at two separate units.
If you want to be a Marine so bad, go active duty. Put in for law enforcement when you get out, or re-enlist if you like it. Plain and simple.
I should also add, that even though it is illegal to do so, employers still will often not hire you because you are a reservist and they have to pay you when you attend AT or deploy.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Hmm, I've run my holy priest through several mythic dungeons and I thought it was very smooth and fun once I talented Circle of Healing.  It was kind of the last spell I needed to have an answer for every situation and I used pretty much every spell, even Prayer of Mending before pulls.  I know I could not have done it by just using Flash Heal.  Circle of Healing is instant 1300% heal divided among the group instead of a 475% on one target and 40% of that on last target for a single Flash Heal. 

Are you referring to the fact that a lot of top parses of holy priests here in prepatch are using Trail of Light and Flash Heal is their top spell?  I think that has to do with the Arch trinket giving a bonus to Flash Heal and the fights being very quick.  In a longer fight, you don't have the mana to sustain constant flash healing and once people outlevel the usefulness of the trinket, I don't think they will be Flash Heal spamming.  ",1470010069

If you are looking at plants, the ones you listed are great starter choices. Note- do not plant the Anubias. Tie it to a rock, piece of diftwood or I've head people letting it float. This plant does not like having its roots covered. It feeds from the water column. As for your choice of substrate. The flourite is good, but you will have to fertilize. The fluorite has no nutrients. I believe it eventually holds on to them- fish poo and what not. Flourish tabs are good. I think since your tank is small, one tab should feed every plant. I use ADA Amazonia or Mr. Aqua as substrates since they are complete and all I have to do is add trace elements for some of the finicky fancy plants. Light. You should be ok. They are low light. Nerites are awesome cleaners. Keep it to one. I put 5 in one tank and I have tons of eggs that will never hatch to scrape. Shrimp. I had Amano. Was told the bettas wouldn't snack on them. They kept the tank spotless. The gravel was clean. The betta slowly took them out. Some people hav luck with them. If you want shrimp start with cheap ghost shrimp. If they live- try Amano.

It is next to impossible to play around something like [[Negate]] , [[Silumgar's Scorn]] or [[Clash of Wills]] . With those in the control deck the question the opponent is not ""Can I commit?"" but ""What can I afford to lose?"" which is not fun at all. On the other hand, if the control deck only plays 4 counter spells (something like mana leak) it's alot more difficult to decide when to counter or when to save it for a better oppotunity and for the opponent it will be possible to play around it or try to bait it out.

[Mirá este video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGYGOZ_B4tw)

Básicamente, le entra polvo/arena a la cadena por el uso normal de la bici, y queda fijado allí por el aceite/grasa de la misma. Esto hace un efecto de esmeril, que acaba desgastando la misma internamente. Entonces se va aflojando y estirando.

Cuál es el resultado? Que los 'huecos' de la cadena donde entran los dientes de los piñones/platos no quedan a la distancia correcta que debían tener, y no calzan bien, con lo que te acaba saltando la cadena.

En casos graves, la cadena acaba deformando los propios dientes, forzándolos a una forma vía desgaste de ['diente de tiburón'](https://g-tedproductions.blogspot.com.uy/2010/11/bike-shop-horrors-shark-tooth.html), lo que implica cambiarlos también, ya sea piñón o plato, porque una cadena nueva te va a seguir saltando.

El desgaste es inevitable, podés atrasarlo un poco lavando la cadena de vez en cuando, tipo cada dos/tres meses. Una forma bien fácil es usar [dos cepillos de diente y un solvente](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLKvoIUMT1U). 

Luego relubricala. Yo uso aceite de cadena de moto diluido 1:1 con un solvente para que penetre mejor, luego el solvente se evapora, y queda el aceite dentro. Dale un par de minutos para que penetre, girando los pedales para que se distribuya bien en la cadena y depués limpia todo lo que haya quedado fuera con un trapo/toallas de papel, para que agarre menos polvo.",1470010071

* For any skill you have, someone out there is better at it.  (And given the internet, the higher you climb, the more likely you are to meet that person.)
* Your worth as a [human being/indie developer/whatever you like] is not contingent on you being the best.

Think of it this way:  Video games.  Do you like more than one game?  Only one of those can be ""the best"" game, so why do people even bother making games, besides [whatever game you like best]?  Or if you like, there's the sports team analogy.  There are tons of people on the team who are not the best shooter/passer/dribbler/footworker/pastamancer on the team (let alone the world) but they are still valuable and important.

If you are unwilling to ever have the second-best looking game in the room, then the odds are (assuming a random distribution of motivation and talent) that you will never even HAVE a game in the room.  

Meanwhile, the people who did make and show off games, [even the ones that weren't the best] have all gotten better at making games, (because making games, like any skill, gets better the more you practice it) are now better at it, and are even further ahead of you.

*Comparison is the thief of contentment.*

Make whatever games, art, whatever, you find fulfilling.  If you see someone who is better at it than you, that does not mean you are a failure.  It just means that you are fortunate, because now you have an easy path to get better.  (i. e. figure out how they're doing that and learn to do it yourself.)",1470010079

3. Just get free stuff at first. To be honest there is a ton of good stuff. 

-	Tiltbrush, Job Simulator and Fantastic Contraption (the free pack in apps)
-	Waltz of the Wizard
-	Surge
-	The Rose and I
-	Budget Cuts Demo
-	The Lab

-	Irrational Exuberance Prologue

-	VR Regatta
-	Abe VR
-	Abbott’s Book Demo
-	The Night Café
-	Nvidia VR Funhouse
-	Colosse
-	Ikea VR Experience
-	Sister’s Demo

To be honest, that could keep you busy for the first week. When you are ready to buy some stuff, I would recommend A Chair in a Room: Greenwater, Holopoint, Audioshield, Space Pirate Trainer, The Gallery, Solus, HordeZ, Raw Data, Pong Waves, Pool Nation…..and of course plenty more good stuff.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; If on a physics test you were to simply ask e.g: For a box of length L with (empty box) mass M filled with N photons of Energy E find the rate at which photons bounce off the walls, R, as a function of the filled box mass M* and the other quantities named above. The answer would be a perfectly reasonable physical quantity which is not just R = kM*. Not sure if that clarifies anything. Hopefully a bit?

That helps clarify what you were saying. I think where we disagree is that when I say ""a box gives a photon mass in the same way the Higgs does"" I think it is fair (or in some sense ""moral"") to finesse the difference between a box with EM-interaction walls and Higgs-condensate interaction ""walls."" There are indeed differences owing to the interaction itself being different (the most important perhaps being the issue you brought up having to do with how often the photon ""hits the VEV wall"" and therefore having to choose the correct box size when doing a heuristical calculation), but I just personally don't think those differences conceptually break the analogy. I think the same issues you point out can also equivalently come from the other direction, namely that realistically there is no such thing as a massless ""box"" that can contain a photon anyways, and in response I would point out that in fact there *is*, it's just not the EM interaction most students are familiar with, but rather a Higgs interaction!

&gt; I was not trying to call structural realism odd. I was calling (my best understanding) of your use of literal odd. It almost sounds silly to type out, but for me having literal particles in boxes includes having physical boxes. Physical boxes have things like walls, and a rest frame, and a finite physical extent, boxes are made out of materials and probably have corners. But this is a statement of semantics. So as before I'm not sure how much its worth pursuing.

I agree this isn't really worth pursuing, but I do just want to clarify in case I wasn't understood here. What you called odd was my appeal to an isomorphism making two otherwise intuitively distinct phenomena literally equivalent. But that's exactly what the structural realist would maintain.

"PoliticalVideo","t5_3arin","&gt; *Trump is morally reprehensible and is suggesting terrible policy.*

I agree absolutely, and everything I have said has made that perfectly clear.  I will reiterate that I never once suggested the profoundly absurd and idiotic notion that he would be ""progressive"", that was ALL YOU.

&gt; *I fail to see how Clinton is worse, which is what you were saying.*

Clinton is personally responsible for a litany of serious criminal actions and reprehensible policies, and has lied more times than anyone can possibly account.  The fact that she hasn't been indicted calls the fundamental integrity of the justice system into question in the minds of most sane observers, given the proven facts of the matters.  We certainly have every reasonable expectation that Trump would be a monster, but we have the proven historical track record that Hillary ***IS*** a monster.  As for election fraud, go argue with the people launching law suites against Hillary and the Dems as we speak.  I'm not the expert on the subject, I just have to take the evidence seriously, because it accords with over a decade of prior systemic problems with election fraud plaguing the American electoral system, much of which has been effectively proven, and almost all of which goes uninvestigated and unpunished.  American democracy is in crisis, and Hillary would be the exception if she wasn't playing that crooked game, but all the evidence says she is.

Frankly, as an outside observer (Canadian), I think America is at the breaking point.  I think your elections are now usually determined not by democracy, but by who can steal each election.  Ironically, monster Trump seems likely to have won the Republican primaries honestly, and that only speaks badly for the people who elected him.  OTOH, Hillary is reasonably perceived to have probably stolen the primaries, against a candidate we now know she wielded corrupt influence to smear at every step in the contest, and who holds the loyalty of around 50% of the party.  Her actions draw the integrity of the election into question, and divide the party.  She could have won or lost on merit, in a transparently honest way, and ***earned*** the loyalty of those who back Bernie.  Instead she spit in their faces.",1470010084

He was very no nonsense, and he would never tolerate any student being insubordinate. Still, he was one of my favorite teachers. But he got me out in the hallway and chewed me out for about 10 minutes. He told me about all these things that I had no memory of saying. It was all so traumatic, but the what he said at the end really hurt me. He said, ""I could expect this from some of my other students, but never from you."" I had never wanted to do anything mean to that teacher, he was always one of my very favorites, but at that moment I felt terrible about what I had done.

There is definitely some valid criticism regarding how Niantic is handling this, particularly regarding communication. As someone who has a good bit of experience with having the ""something is broken, and we're working on a fix"" conversation, good communication can only help. Sure, some people are still going to be frustrated (for good and not-so-good reasons), but it would help assuage the concerns of a lot of the more reasonable players. And assuming the tracking system is going to be fixed/replaced in the near future, it makes sense to disable it--there's no reason to waste resources on something that's going to give you incorrect information. I'd also rather have them take longer to make a good fix instead of rushing it--an incomplete fix is just going to cause more frustration.",1470010088

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt;  Historically, women conducted the vast majority of that labour.

But it wasn't unpaid, or at least not uncompensated. Women did the housework and took care of the kids and in return they were provided with food and shelter. I'm not saying it was a fair system by any means because women often didn't have a choice, but I'm saying it's not accurate to call it unpaid labour. It struck me as rather regressive, but it reminds me of an old [Chris Rock bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOPPjDUV1lo) I stumbled across recently.

I've seen Rainbow, and I enjoyed it a lot more than Glass Mask. Rainbow felt more like a modern retelling with an old setting, Glass Mask didn't feel that way. In Rainbow they were buddies, they had each other, they wanted to get out and wanted a future (with love or work). Glass Mask has this girl who was alone, there was no compassion or friendship, even the person who loved her took away the things she cared most about. 

The feeling I got was that the author who wrote the story had these old fashioned ideas and sentiments, she wrote it in the 60's-80's but she dreamed about these things when she was younger and read books written about even older times. The character's dream of being an actress while throwing away everything else in the process, leaving home to work as a teen, the romanticism with the meek tragic girl who is hated and looked down on by everyone but achieves her dream of becoming a media star (popularity and riches), the acceptance of a creepy love with an older man, the melancholic world and lives; overall the sentiments &amp; themes, they felt old &amp; uncomfortable, a cold strange world that I didn't understand...

Skip Beat kind of gave me a similar vibe. A girl moves to the city &amp; does everything for her boyfriend, but he's nasty to her, but he's not that bad cause everyone needs to be arrogant and look after their self-interests, and she wants her fantasy of stardom to come true... I didn't feel that way about Nana. I did with Ushio and Tora.

---

The year a work of media is made doesn't just affect the setting; it affects the characters, the story, the themes, everything. Our expectations and preferences change over time. 

A lot of old things are liked solely because people apply a ""vintage"" value to it, if Shakespeare was a modern author I don't think his books be nearly as popular. I don't have a vintage value, I want the current, I want something that is culturally relevant, I want something that has the best production quality, I want something I can hopefully relate to, until one day the things I like will be old-fashioned too.

I personally think what your friend is doing is a double edge sword: he can potentially have the ability to connect with recruiters via his friends but he's making the connections meaningless (since he isn't a recruiter, being connected to that many people is pretty useless) and imo it looks like he lacks interest in certain companies; rather he's just throwing his rod and hoping something bites. As for the deli meat cutters and other random people, it is going to mess up the ""people you may know algorithm"" so it really isn't helping him and the breadth of useful connections will be small.

For everyone else, having a male nurse is no big deal and can even be preferred for preteen/teenage male patients just because they feel more comfortable talking guy to guy about certain things.

Edit: side note- for OB rotation I had 2 guys in my class, neither of them interested in OB, and they kind of pushed them more towards the c-sections and routine care than vaginal deliveries. The female floor nurses kind of did more of the hands on stuff for them than they did for us female students.

""It's a big world, everybody has guns, and we're doing the best we can.""

""You're the good guys. You should act like it.""

""But we're here now, tomorrow night we do an immense thing; we have to say what we feel, that government, no matter what its failures in the past and in times to come for that matter, government can be a place where people come together and where no one gets left behind. No one...gets left behind. An instrument of good.""

""We have at our disposal a captive audience of schoolchildren. Some of them don't go to the blackboard or raise their hand cause they think they're going to be wrong. I think you should say to these kids, 'You think you get it wrong sometimes, you should come down here and see how the big boys do it.' I think you should tell them you haven't given up hope, and that it may turn up, but in the meantime, you want NASA to put its best people in the room, and you want them to start building Galileo VI. Some of them will laugh and most of them won't care, but for some they might honestly see that it's about going to the blackboard and raising your hand.""

""Why don't we just take the sixty billion dollars and pay North Korea not to bomb us?""  ""It's hard to believe you're not on the National Security Council.""  ""I feel like they're missing an important voice.""

""This country is an idea, and one that’s lit the world for two centuries and treason against that idea is not just a crime against the living! This ground holds the graves of people who died for it, who gave what Lincoln called the last full measure of devotion, of fidelity.""

I've got over 13 days played and always had a 30ms ping until recently. Now I'm lucky if I get 80ms. Other players are skipping around and rubberbanding so much it's just not any fun at this point. Multiple times the game starts ok and then part way through somebody joins and my ping skyrockets. According to the ""e"", I always get dedicated servers. I use a nighthawk router, my nat is open, port forwarded, hard wired, 100 down and 10 up, the same as its been since the day the game released. I've hard reset my console, modem and router many times.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Exactly. I don't get quite why so many commenters here feel that the debates are a surefire win for the Clinton campaign. Trump is trying to reframe the narrative, casting himself once again as the underdog fighting against a rigged system. And since he's facing Hillary, he actually has a decent chunk of the electorate already half-believing this narrative. The bar is already so low for him - if he appears even half-decent, or manages to fluster Hillary, he wins.



I'm actually frightened that the Clinton team isn't going to take this fight seriously. The Sanders debates didn't exactly fill me with confidence. In all honesty, I'd take a page from **The West Wing** and ""Let Hillary be Hillary"". She's wonky, she's apparently very empathetic in person, and she doesn't suffer fools. That doesn't come across in almost any debate I've ever seen her in. Inside her is a 22-year old valedictorian who once called for a change in the usual way of doing politics, to ""practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible"". 



I'm reading a book about Nixon during the end of the Bush years and the start of the Clinton years. Though famously a cynical, paranoid and ruthless political operator, Nixon believed in the power of ideals. Specifically, a campaign cannot succeed without a big idea. It's what propelled Obama past Clinton in 2008. It's what transformed Sanders into a political sensation. It's why Trump is the Republican nominee. Hillary finally has a big idea that suits her unique, consensus-building identity. But she has to show the American public that ""Stronger Together"" is more than a slogan. She has to make us feel it. If she can do that, I have no doubt she wins. ",1470010101

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","The audio volume tweaks are a good idea but it's poorly utilized here. I couldn't pinpoint why it felt a bit awkward at first but I think I got a few reasons figured out.

Firstly, let's agree on what you're trying to achieve; the music supposedly comes from speakers inside the ESF, so when the POV is outside, we don't hear it as well.

Alright, this said, one thing that clashes with that is the fact that you're not using IG audio. It really feels like a proper montage, as in, there's only this music for our ears to hear and it's obviously added on top of the video, it's not intradiegetic. Thus, lowering the volume when you're in another POV doesn't make sense, it's not inside the diegesis.

Another thing is, it lacks proper audio treatment when lowered. IMO it shouldn't just be *lowered*, but muffled. Look into audio effects if you want to do this kind of montage again, Audacity has a ton of them ready to use.

Lastly, and this one is a bit more subjective, but I think it lacks some video editing for the whole thing to feel nice. The sort of ""in/out"" effect reminds of movie shots with older cars in roadtrips, and your untreated footage really feels way too clean to make sense. Some more grey in the colours or white noise would be welcome to make it feel more natural.

Otherwise the footage is really nice but the editing truly feels half-assed.",1470010102

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","If you've got two full basic tier 3 runepages for AD and AP then you could, from then on it's your own decision wether you want more runes or champions. I suggest having at least AP/AS quints, AD/MP reds, armor yellows and mr blues so you can use every champion at least somewhat effectively. IP isn't that easy to gain unless you use boosts and runes are really expensive, if you buy a champion then you cannot buy more runes to optimise a runepage for a champion you like. 

I also do not advice to buy 3150+ champions unless you've tried them on free rotation or are sure they fit your playstyle when you do not have much IP yet. It would be a big waste when you do not have all the standard runes yet and you rarely play the champion you've bought because you don't like them.

If you play for fun primarily then you can try mechanically difficult champions, if you want to climb asap when you hit 30 or improve more at the game then it's probably better to stick to easy champions for now.",1470010106

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","The thing I hated the most about this book is that they screwed up [time travel](/spoiler) from Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban. 

[In PoA the time travel was perfect, as perfect as just about any science fiction. There's a single timeline and when Hermione or H&amp;H go back in time they join the past - i.e. what they do has already happened, and in fact Harry comments at one point that he knows it happened because he saw it happened. This is how single-timeline time travel works. Going back in time doesn't alter the past, present, or future because what you do has already happened.](/spoiler)

[Then in tCC they decide that going back in time *does* change the past, either because the playwright apparently didn't understand the brilliant time travel in PoA, or he didn't care. So suddenly we go from single-timeline time travel to mulitple-timeline time travel, a la The Butterfly Effect, which by the way means that they never go back to the original timeline.](/spoiler)",1470010106

I think anything is possible with Bloodraven.  But, if he was priming someone to possess, why not Bran?  Bran's more powerful,  younger, and his personality is not a formed as Euron.  

But I don't think it's likely that BR is going to skinchange into any human being.  I think we'll learn why skinchanging into people is a fucking horrible idea in the next book, which is why there is no known empire where the leadership uses warging/skinchanging to give themselves immortality.  If I had to guess, it has to deal with wearing down people's natural resistance to skin changing, as Bran finds it easier and easier to warg into Hodor.  That means that Hodor might be easier for something else to warg into him, with disastrous results.  ",1470010107

"aww","t5_2qh1o","You're responding to things I didn't even say. Health testing does work-if a dog is likely to pass on health defects, don't breed it. Good breeders are breeding dogs to produce healthy puppies of a reliable temperament. They will take those dogs back at any point if their owners can't care for them. They'll make sure the owners are good candidates for that breed and they'll be there to offer advice and assistance to ensure the dog gets the best chance possible. That's what responsible breeding is. Unfortunately not all breeders are responsible, which is why so many dogs still suffer from these conditions.

Pugs are very damaged as a breed and I personally would be afraid to buy or adopt one for fear of losing it-I don't know what the answer is. Breeding them doesn't get rid of those problems, it just passes them on. 'Puggles' for example still suffer from breathing problems.

""What the fuck kind of owner cares more about their garden than their dog dying horrifically?"" I never said that, you are pulling that out of thin air. A good breeder will sell healthy pups to a home that is capable of meeting their needs. They will consider both the pup's physical health and its energy levels, intelligence, grooming needs etc. 

So I'm saying that I think dogs should be health tested to ensure healthy pups and sold to people who are capable of meeting their needs and a good fit for that individual pup in order to give the dog the best chance. That's all. If you disagree then I respect that but please don't accuse me of not caring about dogs' welfare. I put a lot of time and effort into making sure our dogs have a good quality of life-neither of them was even bought from a breeder.

In their eyes, their beliefs make them distinct and the genocide committed by ISIS against them makes it quite obvious that they're in a completely different camp. It's the same with Kurdish muslims who, while being Sunni, have been in direct conflict with terrorist groups for years, again because groups like ISIS attempt to ethnically cleanse them.

There are hundreds of these kinds of distinctions if you look for them, we have a problem that our media and education system doesnt make any distinctions about muslim communities.

&gt; I have zero problems with anyone(unless they give me a reason)

Do tell. Besides being Muslim, what did this woman, who stood by her husband do? Because you are attacking a war hero's mom and you've given absolutely no justification besides the fact that she is Muslim and have talked about what other Muslims may or may not believe. Textbook racism, bro.

&gt; I view as I'm sure you do muslims as normal people. And as normal people we have flaws. The treatment of muslim women is one of them.

Sure. We're in agreement here. If this had been a talk about Muslim culture, this would fit right in. But we are talking about assigning to a specific Muslim your racist stereotype that wasn't true.

How can you not see the difference between saying ""x group has y issue"" and ""z person has y issue because they are in x group."" The second is what Trump did and you keep defending.

""There is a problem with crime in some black communities in America,"" is fine. ""This guy's black so he's probably a criminal,"" is not fine. The second is what you and Trump keep doing. Because you're racists. 

In this country you have a right to be racist. No one is going to arrest you for it. But when you go outside of your racist safe-space, you should expect to be called out for it.

the lower couldn't discuss the higher if they wanted to. The humble can't move the dignified by definition. 

**Actual analysis**: 

I like this one. A couple months ago, I was toying around with the idea of like ""when I am the mountain, I am the mountain. If you turn me into rubble I am the rubble. If you burn the rubble into smoke, I am the smoke. If you make me gone I am gone""

Idk if that makes any sense. 

It is the platform upon which all else rests. There is no under the platform, and to articulate the platform as a definitive thing would be placing something on that platform, which thus isn't the platform 


That's why I was posting ""it's all in front"" for a bit. 

In this Case, I think that's what our friend here was talking about. That which carries that corpse around is before ""illness"". So illness can be treated, but it sees to treating, no illness, nothing. It can dance without moving. It's that which is first. 

Man this is hard to articulate. It's like substratum, but applied to consciousness, but even ""substratum"" and ""consciousness"" are placing things on the platform

I think that's why the master used the wording he did above

Briefly, Skills grant you positive or negative effects, ranging from simple Resistances Up, to Attack Up, to reducing the rate at which you lose Stamina. Skills need to be activated by gaining either +10 or -10 points in a Skill Tree.

These skill points can be accrued by equipping armor pieces, through attaching Decorations to Armor Slots, and by equipping Talismans. These Talismans function like an armor piece, but only grant Skill Points, no Defense. They can also have Slots to attach Decorations. [Here's](http://mhgen.kiranico.com/skill) a complete list of skills.

There's one exception to Armor Pieces granting you skill points - Deviant armor pieces do not grant you their skills until they reach Level 6 through upgrades. ",1470010111

It was a potential game-changer since it not only got a ton of people into a classic bit of ""nerd culture"" who otherwise never would have bothered, but is so far the biggest game by far to get people out of the house and even interacting with each other.  There have been others, but nothing on this insane scale - it had the potential to change a lot of people's behavior regarding gaming.

The company running it seems a bit out of their depth, both in terms of handling the sheer volume of people playing it, but also support responsiveness and communication about potential issues with their playerbase, so they've had a lot of bugs and performance issues.  Several community-run services popped up to compensate for this, for example to let help you find rare Pokemon because the in-game tracking has been broken for weeks, and the publisher recently shut them down for unclear reasons (likely a mix of legal and performance issues).  It's still fun, but this has removed a lot of the playability and made it less fun.  People are annoyed.",1470010112

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Congrats on getting out and having a good job lined up. I know it seems overwhelming, but you're doing far better than most others with a lot of college debt job-wise. I had debt too, and continued living like a student for 3 years after college to get it paid off. Not fun, but it got me out from under it. 

I'm going to ask a question you won't like, and may get down voted to hell: why did you take on so much debt, and what were you thinking at the time? Assuming you did ~$33k per year, you had to know the total was going to be $130k.

I'm not asking to be an asshole. I have 4 kids to get through college, and my first one is taking this exact path. She wouldn't consider community college for 2 years or other alternatives to 4 year university. She's going to graduate $100-125k in debt, and it's going to be crushing. I have 3 more kids to go. 

What could I have said to you about debt or taking loans that would have deterred you or enabled you to take a different path?",1470010119
"math","t5_2qh0n","You're kind of hinting at two different things. There's the real-life interpretation of what probabilities mean, which is sort of a philosophical question more than a mathematical one. The two general ways of interpreting probability are Bayesianism and frequentistism.

But the core of your question doesn't require such a philosophical interpretation, you can easily compute the probabilities of events happening multiple times. If something occurs with probability 1/10 than the odds of it happening exactly once in 10 trial is 10 * 0.1 * 0.9^9 = 9^(9)/10^9 = ~39%. The ""third"" order probability here would be something like: ""if you ran these 10 trials 10^9 times, what are the odds that you get 1 success in exactly 9^9 of them. The answer to that is (10^9 choose 9^(9)) * 0.9^(9^9) * 0.1^(10^10 - 9^9) (which seems to take wolfram too long to compute).

Note that this doesn't ""scale"" with the number of events: the odds of getting 2 successes out of 20 is (20 choose 2) * 0.1^2 * 0.9^18 = ~29%, less than the odds of 1 in 10.",1470010119

I like curvy lines in a photo, from hair waves (any length, just doing something interesting) or your posture or flowers or clothing, something that isn't just your (lovely) oval face in the middle of my screen.  I like when a hand is included, though that takes longer to draw so you might get less art overall. I love when people pose in nature.  I like vintage clothes/props, or photos that have an old timey spirit.  I especially like lace, flowers, beards and braids.  I like real moments of joy in candid photos but strongly dislike fake ""say cheese"" smiles.   

I like when anyone puts in an obvious effort to share a nice image and not just their last Facebook profile picture.  It's fun when submitters are creative.  If you took the picture especially for redditgetsdrawn and it's a nice picture, I'm more likely to draw you.

I would love to see more people with varying skin tones post, and I do not only want to draw 19 year old models.  I just like interesting photos where *whoever* has put in some effort.  I often spend 3 hours on a rgd drawing, sometimes much more, so you spending 10 minutes to get a good photo is not that much work, comparatively.  

Edit: glasses.. I'm sorry, I don't like doing glasses.  I get that you look like that, you look very nice in them, I wear them too, but 99% of the time it is no fun for me to draw.  If you have a monocle, pince-nez, opera glasses or antique binoculars I might think about it. ;)",1470010122

[Have a issue on HTC Vive that I cannot find replicated anywhere else?](/r/Vive/comments/4vjt6y/have_a_issue_on_htc_vive_that_i_cannot_find/) by  GREENSMONKEY


Hey, to give some background, I first used the Vive on my own computer with a AMD Radeon R9 280x GPU and a 4 core Intel i5, it ran well, worked and I could play games, but the room was small so we transferred it to the front room, much more room and linked it up to my fathers PC instead. AMD Radeon R9 290 GPU, cant remember what CPU he has exactly but on the SteamVR test it was getting just on the cusp of green, so it would work, but even without starting SteamVR or even when its on, the monitor will randomly shut off with the vive, and go black saying it no longer has a signal, but the computer will keep running. Cannot find any fixes anywhere, and ideas or fixes with people who had this issue before would be great, thanks!

Rest it.  Rest, rest, rest it.  Going back too quickly and pushing too hard too soon will just leave you open to a reinjury, which will possibly be worse.  Remember R.I.C.E.: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation.  NSAID pain relievers will probably be helpful as well.  Don't resume your practice without your doctor's approval.

Even once you go back, be very mindful of what you can/can't do.  Let your teacher(s) know what's up, and they'll likely look out for you and give you pointers.  Feel free to skip poses where you're on your hands, or substitute in poses where you're on your forearms (dolphin instead of down dog, etc.).  Heck, if your hands are up for it, try doing those poses on your knuckles, with a straight wrist.

Most importantly, take some time before class to warm up your wrists.  I got a wrist warmup routine from an acroyoga class where you start in tabletop (hands and knees), and make circles with your torso while keeping your wrists planted.  Do this in both directions, with your fingers pointed straight ahead, then to the outside, then to the inside.  Look online for ""handstand prep"" routines, as those typically involve lots of wrist work as well.

In the meantime, remember that this is an excellent learning opportunity, to learn to listen to your body.  Remember, yoga isn't about the asanas--the asanas are just there to train the body and mind to sit in stillness and comfort so you can meditate.  If you can do that, then the asanas will always be there when you're ready.

Best of luck!

"writing","t5_2qh2n","If I'm understanding you correctly, there are many strategies for this type of ""inspiration"" writer's block (as opposed to ""no ideas"" writer's block).


Some I've seen work before:



1. 10 Minute Torrent: write a non-stop stream of consciousness for a few minutes. It doesn't have to be good, grammatically correct, or even coherent. All that matters is that you do it. Write about anything


2. Character Monologue: Write out a ""draft monologue"" for each of your characters. Just let your character talk, almost like a draw my life or a confession, about their hopes, dreams, struggles, fears, shames, loves, etc. 


3. Tricks: Literally trick yourself into writing. Just tell yourself ""ok I only have to write a paragraph"" but then after doing that just write more. Or say ""I'll write a page for every each time I use Google Search"". Well, guess how many times a day that is.




If I'm misunderstanding you and you have a ""no ideas"" or don't know where to go with your plot, then there's this:


1. Write out of order. Not everyone is a ""planning"" writer, you might be a ""discovery"" writer like me, in that you have absolutely no idea what you're going to write until you actually type it out. This is perfectly OK, sometimes even favorable to plotting out a story beforehand. You can find more on the advantages and disadvantages online, but I've seen successful writers who a) don't plan things out b) don't even write their stories *in order*, and just write a scene as soon as it pops into their minds. No context, no planning, no build up, just a scene.



2. If your problem is that you *can't* write without a plan, then make a plan....as a ""discovery"" writer, I loathe making plans, but I find that writing outlines is one of the most expansively covered topics in English classes and writing blogs all over the internet.

So, instead, I took like ten minutes finding out all the details, and it turns out that the price he was quoted was higher than the price he was being charged. I call the manager over, manager agrees with me, dude pays for his pizza with food stamps and then leaves. 

EDIT: It was a woman and her man. Both were getting very upset over 30 cents. I work minimum goddamn wage, I barely scrape by every month, and if I ordered pizza and was told at the counter that it was thirty cents more, I wouldn't waste my time over it.

1. Huge waste of money when you are using the internet to plan things ahead ... browse, read and know for free, why hire a person for that?

2. In Japan people speak Japanese, not English. Expect zero level of english outside Airports, Hotel lobbies and information desks at medium/big stations.

3. Behave like a nice person and you would be fine. They will still see you as a foreigner.

4. Absolutely essential that you wear clothes at all times. Good idea to have your passport and money with you.

5. Amazing sushi: any sushi place. Fancy sushi: any overpriced sushi place. Do not expect sushi to taste the same as in US.

6. Most bath houses have restrictions, you will need to ask/research individually. No, you are not considered Yakuza, but rather part of a gang or bad company (which, obviously, the biggest gang was Yakuza so it is a normal explanation)

7. US is the only place with that kind of over-the-top patriotism (sorry), in Japan you will look just like a tourist trying too had, which will probably make people laugh (behind your back), so do it.

That's almost two million people who read my words (filtered through an editorial staff). I'm proud of that number but I'm aware it's not a marginally sizable percentage of the populace of the globe that consumes media, the top of which, is the Olympics.

Nielsen reported the 2008 Olympics solicited over 4 *billion* people tuned in to some form or another of an NBC affiliate. That's just television. 

Brah, I'm not saying it won't be a shitshow. It will be. I'm gonna read all those articles and watch the videos and say ""we told you so"" along with you and the rest of reddit. It's what we do here.

But even we at reddit are a marginally small portion of that global, media-consuming populace.

I'm saying that NBC won't air a shitshow because that's not what their advertisers are paying for. They will cut it however they have to. I don't think anyone could really argue that's not the reality of a company like NBC.

And by the way, they're still the most popular way to consume the Olympics worldwide.  Again, not everyone is online every passing minute like this generation (myself included).

I don't agree with the rest of the sub that cards matter all that much since mine are pretty bad (12% all attack, 7% energy, 0% physical, 20% scd, the rest are resists) and I can go 5/5 on every WB except iThanos.  I am in a level 29 alliance though so I get those bonuses.  

I think the #1 thing you can do to get more WB clears (after being in a lvl24+ alliance) is get some ""when attacking"" strikers and get their first gear to 20 and get their skills leveled.  Having extra people come out and attack all the time when you fight a world boss is the key if you are doing subpar damage.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","Originally named Weeghman Park and eventually bought by a chewing magnate, this is one of America's jaw-dropping locales, Wrigley Field in the North Side of Chicago. [Tonight, we have a great interleague matchup between the Seattle Mariners and the Chicago Cubs](http://i.imgur.com/5UfXwpH.jpg)

For the Seattle Mariners, they look to end July at .500(12-11 entering today's game in the month). After being banged and whisked around in the Steel and Windy City, a 10-1 loss on Wednesday and a 12-1 loss on Friday respectively, the Mariners bounced back with a 4-1 win with the help of Wade Miley(now with Baltimore) on Saturday. This is their first night back on Sunday Night Baseball in 12 years as well, so they'll be looking to make quite the impact as they continue to try to revive their playoff hopes in the 2nd half, a team that hasn't been to the postseason since 2001. Felix Hernandez though has made it clear, ""It's another game"". They'd hope it's like their other interleague performances, 11-5 against the National League.

For the Chicago Cubs, they come into the deadline with only ""crickets"", as Joe Maddon puts it, on the phone lines. They don't want to make waves because they want to smoothly sail as the team with the best record in the Majors. However, their last meeting with Seattle yesterday was anything but smooth, errors galore and their prized acquisition, Aroldis Chapman, in a save opportunity against a [familiar foe](http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/6/7/6/165064676/cuts/Leonys_Martin_o4tm0hax_0yg39yz0.jpg). July hasn't been as friendly to the Cubs as the rest of the first half of the season, 11-14 in the month. This could be a real good opportunity in this rubber match to get the ship back on course.


##[Today's pitching matchup](http://i.imgur.com/4YqkalU.png)

For the pitching matchup, the key theme is redemption. Two men trying to redeem themselves on the mound. 

First for Chicago, it's 29 year old lefty Brian Matusz, the former Oriole was traded to Atlanta earlier this season and was eventually cut by the Braves. The Cubs signed him up to add pitching depth and he played well in his two starts down at AAA Iowa, posting a 1.93 ERA, 1.071 WHIP in 9.1 IP. A reliever for the past few years, Matusz hasn't started a game since July 1st, 2012. But he knows what's at stake

&gt;""Matusz and I played together for quite a while,"" said Jake Arrieta, who spent parts of four seasons in Baltimore. ""I've seen him pitch extremely well. ... He's a smart guy. He's got some really good pitches that he knows how to use effectively. I look forward to watching him pitch.""

For Seattle, it's King Felix! Felix Hernandez in his first start at Wrigley Field, and he hopes to put on a regal performance against the Cubbies as Hernandez just hasn't found his game and people are questioning his abilities. Only two starts since coming of the disabled list, where he spent two months of the season, Hernandez struggled in those starts but his team were able to put together good hitting to bail him out. In his first start back, there's even a neat little story about the reporters waiting for Hernandez by his locker, and Felix responded with “Why are you guys waiting for me? I gave up five runs”.  The last time he even started against Chicago was 2010.

Here's the batting order:

"subaru","t5_2rdhg","About a month ago the radio cleared backorder and was delivered, about 4 days before I left for vacation. So far this radio has been sweet! Its so much better than using the stock nav unit Subaru had in there, but we all knew that.

It boots up quick Android Auto is automatic recognizing once I connect my phone. I also elected to run an HDMI cord into the glove box incase I want to try and watch a movie or something (I know it dangerous and illegal but I have only played movies that I know word for word and don't need to watch it in my old truck). It really pushes the stock speakers and the sound is 1,000 times better! 

I have no gripes with the unit itself except I now have a GPS antenna and Sirius antenna sitting on my dash.
My problems all come with the accessories Crutchfield paired with this. I had to trim down the surround so the trim piece will fit back on the car. Even now when the faceplate tilts it pushes the trim off the dash so I still have some work to do. The aftermarket trim ring doesn't actually connect to the bracket the radio slides into so I think the only thing really holding it up is the dash trim. And form talking to someone else on here I guess I have to manually program the module to retain steering wheel controls. 

Next up will be reverse camera and maybe either front facing or figuring out a way to wire up and mount a camera for driver side lane changes.

Hacking is awesome, very versatile. Max Hacking is OP: L3 can take down 4 shield layers. Great for beams. Hacking locks down the doors of the hacked room (as long as Hacking is powered), great for making the boss shield room a kill zone (or non-boss, not-necessarily-shield rooms). Also counters blast doors, making fires spread more easily.

Even L1 Hacking is useful. Hacking Piloting or Engines reduces evasion to 0, meaning all your shots hit. Hacking weapons reduces their charge, and if you let one weapon fire then hack, disrupting their timing, you could avoid damage. (Of course if you can't take out their weapons, they will charge after your hack is over, so it's potentially only a temporary solution.)

Hacking does use drone parts; Drone Recovery Arm does not apply.

Conversely, you can get hacked. If doors are hacked, *all* rooms get locked down during the hack. A hacked room, depending on location on your ship, can make it difficult to move about, re: repairs, fires, boarders. At least you can possibly use two or more crew to beat down the same door.

Getting your weapons hacked can really suck, especially if the enemy also has cloaking. Consider keeping your weapons loadout under 20 sec cooldown (Halberd or faster).

The Flak Gun Mk I is comparable to the Burst Laser Mk II. 2 power for 3 shrapnel shots, 10 sec cooldown, very common in stores. Defense drones can shoot down a shot, and shots have spread, meaning not all will hit a narrow room. An adjacent room might get hit, but if it's an isolated narrow room, you could miss a ship with no evasion.

Mind Control is fun, enabling temporary takeover of an enemy crew member (follows AI rules, though). Increased MC lasts longer, and provides temp HP and combat damage increases. If you MC the Pilot, there could be no evasion, enabling shots to hit. Autopilot could provide some evasion, so it's not guaranteed, and if another crew member goes to fight, they get manning back. MC'd crew stops repairing, moves to another room if that room's system is destroyed.

Getting your crew MC'd can be a pain, especially if you don't have a lot of crew to deal with it. Just L1 MC of your own can counter any level of enemy MC. If your MC'd guy is in a room with enemy boarders, you might not get your guy back, instead MCing one of theirs.

We couldn't go out for her birthday or let other people see us observing it .

These nephews are her relatives that she always isolate my brother and me from and wouldn't let us be part of that family, so it was extra hurtful that they were allowed to do things publicly with her that my brother and I were not (she was always embarrassed by us).

She ignored my birthday in my 20's except for a card about herself. In my 30's is when she wanted to do the joint birthday, I think because I was much better off financially by then and could pay.

I'm too happy with the tricks I pulled to not write them down (even if it's only so I can revisit it later and understand it again), so here's a write-up.

`index ^ index / 2` converts the `index` to its Gray code of the same index. It just so turns out that when you ""remove"" the Gray code from the folding, it turns into a nicer sequence. This isn't all too surprising; the folding is a way to construct the [Dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) and [the Gray code is useful in calculating its properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Gray_code_method). Notably (though this didn't occur to me when working the method out - I actually just used the [OEIS](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=oeis&amp;oq=OEIS&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j0l2j69i60l2.1512j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)),

&gt; Bell Labs researcher Frank Gray introduced the term reflected binary code in his 1947 patent application, remarking that the code had ""as yet no recognized name"".[\[1\]][1] He derived the name from the fact that it ""may be built up from the conventional binary code by a sort of reflection process"".

But, OK, how? Well, consider you're folding some paper. We'll consider numbering it before folding (so we're looking at the inverse mapping).

    0 1 2 3

    0 1
    2 3

    0
    2
    1
    3

Then add another layer by doubling the width.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

    0 1 2 3
    7 6 5 4

    0 1
    7 6
    4 5
    3 2

    0
    7
    4
    3
    2
    5
    6
    1

Note that

    0 1 ← old
    7 6    ← new
    4 5    ← new
    3 2 ← old

has the new part sandwiched between the old; any further folds cannot thus tear apart the quadruplets like `0 7 4 3` or `1 6 5 2`.

There's a nice pattern in `0 7 4 3` and `1 6 5 2` when viewed as binary:

    lhs           rhs
    000 111   100 011

    lhs           rhs
    001 110   101 010

Namely, the lhs' new partner is the logical not of the old value and the rhs' new partner is the logical not of the old value. This follows because the *first* fold

    0 1 2 3
    7 6 5 4

paired each number up with `2^fold - i`. (Note: I use `^` for both exponentiation and XOR.)

The Gray code is a way to remove this pairing. Let's start with the mapping

    0 1

and iterate the same ""grow inside the pairs"" rule, but instead of doing `2^fold - i` we map each pair

    x y

to

    2x 2x+1 2y+1 2y

This rule produces:

    0 1
    0 1 3 2
    0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4
    0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4 12 13 15 14 10 11 9 8....

so we now have a way to undo the ""curliness"" of the function. It turns out this corresponds to a production rule for the Gray code, which has an n^th term `x ^ ⌊x / 2⌋`.

So this lets us find a number for any index that somehow corresponds to the original. We still need to deal with the iterated production rule of `2^fold - i`, but now we can use the Gray code - `x ^ x/2` - to help.

Our production rule in the Gray code was `2x` or `2x+1`, which we need to convert to a rule of `2^fold - i`, or a bitwise not of the bottom `fold` bits of the value. At index `x`, consider its binary code:

    0b100100111

Each 1 represents a `2^fold - i` we should have applied (since it comes from `2x+1`) and each `0` represents none. Since `fold` increases as you go rightwards down the bits, we really want

      0b1
    ^ 0b1111
    ^ 0b1111111
    ^ 0b11111111
    ^ 0b111111111
    =============
      0b100011101

and then to flip the bits, since `2^fold - i` inverts the *bottom* bits, whereas we've inverted the top bits.

The XOR can be done with a polynomial multiplication, since a polynomial multiplication with a sufficiently large bitset of 1s gives

      0b1111111111111...11111
    ^    0b1111111111...11111111
    ^       0b1111111...11111111111
    ^        0b111111...111111111111
    ^         0b11111...1111111111111
              =======================
      0b1110001011111...1111100011101

and you can just drop the top bits. This is done with the `_mm_clmulepi64_si128` instruction. However, it's possible to improve this by realizing that

    x = [ f e d c b a ]

so

    x ^ ⌊x / 2⌋ =
        [ f e d c b a ] ^
        [ 0 f e d c b ]

so `_mm_clmulepi64_si128(x ^ ⌊x / 2⌋)` has bits

    bit[0] =          a ^ b == a ^ b
    bit[1] = bit[0] ^ b ^ c == a ^ c
    bit[2] = bit[1] ^ c ^ d == a ^ d
    bit[3] = bit[2] ^ d ^ e == a ^ e
    ...

and the result is just `bit[i] = x[0] ^ x[i+1]` for each `i`. This is calculable with

    (index / 2) ^ -(index &amp; 1)

Then, of course, is the bit swap. Lamely, this actually takes most of the 36 instructions - it takes just 11 without the bit swap. I've [stolen some vectorized code for that](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24058332/1763356), but it's still the largest part of the function.

ESALs are ""equivalent single axle loads"" which is more of a damage factor than a load factor. These are used in subbase and pavement thickness design. 

The ESAL of a 1000lb single axle vehicle (way more than the average motorcycle) is.00002. Your average semi is 41,000lbs and 3.0 ESALs. 

3/.00002=  150,000. Over 150,000 motorcycles do the equivalent damage as a single 41,000 pound semi. So ya, go fuck yourself.",1470010164

"Swimming","t5_2r0po","It's super hot and uncommonly muggy here in LA, so I decided to switch from jogging to swimming for the indefinite future. Great decision! I did a swim workout today for the first time in years. It was humbling that my whole workout consisted of what I used to do as a warmup back in high school:

a) 2x100 easy warmup with a long enough rest in between to catch my breath
b) 10x50 on an interval (though today I couldn't see the clock, so I just gave myself 15 seconds between each rep)
c) 2x200 nice and easy

= 1100 yards

I am not sure how I will start to build up my workouts after this, aside from setting up in a lane closer to the clock so that I can see it and discipline those intervals! At the moment, I don't have any interest in doing any strokes besides freestyle.

I guess my immediate goal is to keep adding volume to the end of this warmup sequence until I reach 1650 (a mile). Then I will start to do more interval work in order to get the same cardio workout that I am used to from jogging.",1470010165

Lawyers cost money and the more time it takes to prosecute this makes this pyrrhic given the PR niantic would face if they did this.

Really NORMAL thing to see in institutions - [warning NSFL](http://www.4lawdoc.com/bed-sores)

We are also expecting animals - which live outside, literally - all of them - to live in accommodation we as humans would expect.

"TMBR","t5_2r99c","I'm in favour of legalizing bestiality, but for slightly different reasons. 

I'm against animal abuse, but bestiality doesn't automatically equate to abuse -- in the example you gave of a man having a dog lick his penis, it's safe to say that the dog isn't being harmed (assuming it's not being physically restrained and forced to do the act, of course). The fact is, many animals will willingly perform sexual acts with humans, and oftentimes it even brings them pleasure.

I think animals actually CAN consent, in a certain way. They have a rich ""vocabulary"" of body language and vocalizations, which they can use to let us know how something makes them feel. If your dog is whimpering and trying to run away, stop what you're doing, but if he's enthusiastically humping you then it's pretty obvious that he wants to 'do it' and there's no issue.

Basically, I would draw the line at acts that actually harm the animal in some way, but if the animal isn't bothered by it or receives pleasure from it then I don't see any reason to prohibit it.",1470010170
"Endo","t5_2s8ot","I have heard of this theory - and it makes sense IF endo is a progressive cellular condition. We're not sure it is. Right now, we're functioning off of limited research and largely anecdotal evidence. However, some food for thought.

Endo has been proved to grow or spread in Dr. Redwine's studies. He found about 66% of women could have symptoms and endo lesions progress, even post excision. So it's definitely possible that endo can return.

However, in practice, a lot of people get surgery from doctors who are not specialists in endo or who use less effective cauterizing techniques, rather than excision, which is much more effective. That can cause symptoms to recur, even without growths, because the endo wasn't cut out, but rather just lasered off the top layer. Deep endo lesions were essentially left.

There also is the factor of inexperienced surgeons who aren't specialists missing the various ways endo presents. There are literally hundreds of presentations, and a good surgeon has to know where to look for them in order to get them all. Leaving endo lesions, even small ones, can mean that symptoms will return. Since many women are initially treated by OBGYN's and not specialists, that can often mean repeat surgeries are needed.

Because of these three things, it's hard to know if such a thing as microscopic endo truly exists, or if it's just the result of poor surgeons, poor technique, or being a member of the 66% of women who have progressive symptoms regardless.

It's one of the major things we need studies on - along with why endo happens, and how it works, and how else we can control it.",1470010170
"GameTrade","t5_2tbft","
It looks like this trade is about selling an account. **If you want to buy an account, then please read this warning carefully first**. Trading accounts is not against the rules of /r/GameTrade, but it is probably against the games company's terms of service and **it is extremely risky**. 

* Even if you change the security question and registered email account, the account can probably still be taken back by the original owner.

* There could be be other problems with an account, such as an impending ban for scamming or cheating.  For example, the seller could have paid with a stolen credit card, or chargeback their payment. In that case, the company will certainly delete unpaid for items from the account, they will probably disable the account and they could ban you from having any account with them in future. Valve can VAC ban an account months after cheating is detected, and might VAC ban all Steam accounts that use the same phone number or email.

* Games could be region locked when you try to play them, because you are in a different country from the original owner. Some games check  this every time you start playing, or even during play.

* The company probably won't help you if anything goes wrong with the trade. It's almost always against the game publisher's [Terms of Service (TOS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/wiki/index#wiki_account_trading_and_tos) to trade an account. 

* Transferring an account, especially if it's to a user in another country, could trigger the company's account theft protection and lock the account automatically, or block trading and purchasing. You might be able to contact support to try to ask them to unlock it, but might have to wait many days.

* If you sell your account to someone who uses it to scam, this can be linked back to you, and will do a lot of damage to your own online reputation.

* If you buy an account that has been used to scam or for payment fraud, then you could not only lose that account, but also end up with **all your other accounts getting banned** and your online reputation ruined. 

* As with any other trade, you should do your homework and background checking, and beware of offers that look too good to be true.

Because of all these risks, and other issues, you shouldn't expect to get anything close to the full value of your account if you sell it. For example, for Steam and Origin accounts, depending on the games you have, you might get 10% - 30% of the store value. When you're selling an account, older games are usually almost worthless. You might get more if you have a very new game, or access to a closed beta of a very popular game. Steam account value calculator: https://steamdb.info/calculator/

Definition of Account trading: Account trading is when you sell or trade your username, password and other details required to login to an account. The buyer gets full control of the account, including all the games and virtual items stored in the account. For Steam accounts, they will also get full access to linked accounts on other sites that use Steam authentication.

These responses and jokes to the community come out almost every day, especially around new patches or changes (especially bugs or mistakes). They run a tight ship, and know the importance of communicating to keep the community from withering, especially when changes are implemented. These employees and devs are actually making and playing their own game. And they've been doing this since before the game came out. You don't see ArenaNet (creator of GW2) whining about needing to hire a Community Manager before talking to the community; literally everyone working there is encouraged to get out on Twitter and Reddit and talk to the players who pay their salaries.

"anime","t5_2qh22","I fully 100% disagree with that statement by digibro. The anination definitely added to the work. What a backwards thing to even mention. 

I think people only focus on the animation being used on action sequences but it goes VERY Awell with the over the top comedy the show has. Everything is DO expressive. The different animation techniques are great at highlighting someones emotional state. 

One thing I enjoy about Western animation is the use over the top animation to portray an expression or tone. 

And since the show revilves around espers and the supernatural, I think it is very fitting to jave unusual animation. 

I know a ton of anime fans don't like their characters to give off non conventional expressions and facial animation but I appreciate having characters that actually emote kitside a specific moe, sol trope.

This is also Studio bones which is great at this kind of stuff. Look at Space Dandy. Reminds me of that. The colors, the wacky animation, the colors, the varied cartoony expressions, the colors, the bold lines with contrasting colors.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I think the idea behind making these spells all in the common slot ( and i'm not saying its the right way to do this ) is so these spells can compete against themselves.  Example you would see Fireball,Frost Bolt, and Firelands Portal, and you would have to pick one and the other two spells would be disregarded.  By putting say Firelands Portal in the rare slot now you would still get all of the good common removal, and on top of that there is now a chance to see it in the rare slot.  Which would make more efficient removal available to the player in the long run.  Technically speaking.  Im not saying that is right to do it this way but this problem is not fixed by swapping the rarity between babbling book and firelands portal.  You would need to rework the whole rarity spell gems.

Ron seems just to be there as comic relief and Harry is a terrible parent, but Ginny also isn't much better. At the end of the real series Harry has a meaningful relationship with his children, and a key point is that he would have had a chance to practice with Teddy growing up (while not a parent played a major role in his life). A big issue with this play is how isolated Albus feels from his dad and his family, but in the end of the book he had plans to have tea with Hagrid, Neville was a family friend, and he has countless cousins, there is no way that Albus would have become such a sad and lonely child with that much support around him.

Then after you curl it, while the hair is still hot blow some cold air onto it with your hair dryer. It will help the frizz stay away, the curls will hold better and your hair will look shinier. If you want to, you can put a tiny bit of morrocan oil in, but only ever put it on the tips of your hair. If you put it through all your hair it will frizz up and look greasy. 

Also another trick, it takes a lot of extra time but works well - straighten your hair first, wait for about 20 mins to cool down, then use the curler and cool hair dryer on it. These curls will hold extremely well and are usually the least likely to frizz.

I just did a quick review of the Australian confiscation policy and found this quote (this is what really bugs me!!) [My emphasis]: ""By the beginning of the 1980s, the relative popularity of shooting and the prevalence of firearms in the community began to **fall** as **social attitudes** changed and urbanisation increased. The rise of new values including feminism, environmental awareness and **media reports of American gun violence** created an awareness of gun control as a potential issue.""  I would love to see ""social attitudes change"" in the US.  

I know this quote doesn't address your previous remarks, but this type of stuff is what prompted my original post...just like your ""homicide"" argument doesn't address my ""mass shootings.""  Mass shootings (like terrorism) have a psychological effect on all of us, homicides don't.  Mass shootings have been increasing.  

And, social attitudes in this country will change, all it's going take is for American citizens (that just happen to have beards, turbans and names like Mohammed) with legal open carry guns walking through a mall.

"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","Here is my problem/rant in regards to pokevision being taken away, it detracts from the ORIGINAL pokemon experience we've wanted. People will cry foul that this was cheating. In no way shape or form is this cheating.

1. Ever heard of a pokedex? A pokedex in the games showed EXACTLY where a pokemon would spawn. If I wanted a meowth I'd go to where the meowths were
2. Pokevision made it an actual adventure. There were many times my girlfriend and I would be sitting at home and all of a sudden an rare pokemon would show up. We'd quickly get our gear together, and literally run to where this location was, often with just seconds left to get the pokemon. This was actual FUN
3. I'm not even going to start about how broken the scanner is, how unreliable it is, and how it doesn't update. Many times what my scanner said was completely false compared to pokevision

So now Niantic wants me to aimlessly walk around and explore, or at least that's what they and others say you should do. But we all know this ISN'T what people are doing, they are going out and sitting on their butts, down at a popular location, and using lures to get pokemon. THIS ISN'T WHAT POKEMON WAS MEANT TO BE!!! Sitting on your butt and having pokemon come to you. Anyone who says ""But Joe, pokemon is about exploring and finding pokemon, thats the whole fun"" Screw off. If I can sit on my butt and get 100 pokemon in an hour, but only 10 in an hour of walking the system is broken.
This then leads to the whole update and what Niantic WANTS to happen

1. Buy more lures
2. Pokemon hit boxes have changed, they run easier, and they tend to break out more, guess what you need to buy now Pokeballs
3. Buy more incenses cause now the whole game is about sitting on my butt, so why not buy a incense to make this easier
4. Buy more incubators, cause man, who doesn't want a pidgey to hatch out of an egg

More on the eggs, why in the world would you reward people for getting off their butts, and walking a minum of 2K with a Pidgey, Weedle, or any of these terrible pokemon. If the ACTUAL goal is to get people off their butts then give them a reason too. An egg hatch should be at the very LEAST an uncommon like vulpix, growlith, etc. I don't care about the RNG argument, JUST DON'T INCLUDE THE LOW TIER POKEMON.

But how much effort has been made to let others here know about that?  Most ebike riders do NOT expect to need a license.  In fact one of the most significant advantages of ebikes over mopeds and/or motorcycles is that you do **NOT** need a lot of those hassles involved with M1/M2 endorsements.  Given the frequent questions and clarifying comments about local laws and regulations governing ebikes across both the US as well as the world, the average visitor to this sub knows far less than him, you, or me.  

Also, it is foolish to ride at those speeds with a regular bike helmet and no proper protection for the rest of your body.

But if you split that goal up into smaller goals, each sub-goal being just two weeks, then a single day means a lot more.

So basically: add more milestones and re-occuring incentives.

Alternatively you can shift your focus from the goal to the system. If you are preparing for a marathon race five months from now and need to run X miles per day, make the goal itself your system. The goal is no longer to run the marathon, but to follow the running system every day. If you followed your daily system, you get to reward yourself with something you like: a snack, or a film etc. If you want to do it properly, let the incentive be your own satisfaction and rest.

That feels bad even among casual groups – my friends were more liberal with their money than me, and it definitely showed in gameplay.

Yes, it feels bad to have your spells countered. Maybe it really does feel worse than having your creatures destroyed because you ""never get to play magic."" But when you don't even have a deck that stands a chance, you truly never get to play magic.

There is no way Microsoft is going to allocate any effort to a project like that without documentation and support from Niantic.  Since they clearly didn't create this with 3rd party support in mind I doubt that really exists.  And again, this probably requires all kinds of legal shit to be worked out between both parties.

Sure the actual process of developers sitting down and making an app is pretty straightforward, all the business stuff around it is not.  It would probably take quite a while and be expensive, which is why it isn't worth it when they look at the size of the user base.",1470010189

She didn't back down and she ended up getting crushed for it. The bill never got a vote and was never even fully crafted before the industry shelled out millions of dollars attacking her. 

I believe that experience left her somewhat scarred. Those are still her core values deep down, but she's more apt since then to approach issues like healthcare a bit more cautiously.

its her life and all but 90% of the time stories like OP's are textbook ""grass is always greener"" and then down the road the dumper selfishly tries to come back in the ex's life after they realize the fuckup. done it myself and have had it done to me as well.

I asked JODI why she had taken the rat poison to which she stated she tried to kill herself because she found out about STEVEN and his niece, MARIE. When they got to the hospital, STEVEN lied to the hospital staff and told them JODI mistakenly had drank out of a coke can that had rat poison in. According to JODI, STEVEN did not want the hospital staff to know she had tried to commit suicide.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","&gt;  Fixing your car, making your clothes and growing your own food is total waste of time. 

It's very strange to me that you've managed to develop a strong understanding of the concept of comparative advantage while remaining completely ignorant of the fundamentally subjective nature of utility value.  One of the most basic sources of comparative advantage is the fact that *different people value things differently*, and often resolve the same economic tradeoffs in opposite ways.

Fixing one's own car, making one's own clothes, and growing one's own food may make perfectly rational economic sense for someone whose tastes and desires diverge significantly from what's commonly available on the market to the point that the costs of fulfilling their particular preferences on the market is actually higher than producing things for themselves.  If you value your economic independence more than you value the additional time and resources it takes for you to produce these goods for yourself, then it likewise makes perfect sense to do so.

People who use Linux in general -- and Arch in particular -- often do so for these exact reasons: they value having direct control over their computing experience more than they value the additional time and effort that it takes to establish such control, and they often desire for their computing experience to be something other than what's typically offered in mass-market, off-the-shelf solutions.

Arch is absolutely a niche product, but it serves a niche that actually exists, and which there actually has a perfectly comprehensible and rational for existing.  The bottom line is that just because something isn't for *you* doesn't mean that it isn't for *anyone*.  ",1470010198

Then after the birth, we should have a rush of endorphins and new inventions made possible by the AI, a new regime of structure and resource management, and see a windfall of love and excitement across the globe. 

At least, coming at it from someone who has been on the mountain (if not the peak) that's what it feels like right now.

""You know how in porn the bottom gets teased and then the top pushes in and everything opens up and he glides in and the bottom moans and it's all good and 5 seconds later he is getting pounded? That doesn't happen in real life. It takes a lot of work to bottom your first time and even then some work before bottoming unless you are getting fucked on the daily. 
So he recommended[ these plugs](https://www.amazon.com/Trinity-Vibes-VE801B-Anal-Trainer/dp/B003JI4Q50/ref=sr_1_9_s_it?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470010049&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=anal+trainers)  or [these plugs](https://www.amazon.com/Anal-Trainer-Real-Vibes-Hypoallergenic/dp/B015TLFTNM/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1470010049&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=anal+trainers) and to tease for a bit before moving on up. It is a very very different feeling to use a toy compared to the real thing but if you recognize that and take your time, it can be just as fun. 
I personally use the first plugs and then I have a dildo that I use at times but I'm not a fan of that because for it being ""only 6 inches"" like the box said, it is quite a task to take and I think the measurements are wrong on it. 
Also, lube is a very very good idea. I recommend silicone (swiss navy works really well).
Also, all this can be purchased on Amazon.com and will arrive discreetly if that is an issue.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Honestly, it's a lot easier to think about it that way as a daily quest to ""Win 1 game"". The specifics like you said are important, but a 2nd daily quest could go a long way with basic objectives like:

* Play x role (or fill) for one match in dynamic queue
* Place x trinkets and wards
* Kill the Rift Herald, Baron, or Elder Dragon x times
* Get 4 dragon buffs in a single match
* Get a Triple Kill

I feel like there could be some aimed more toward specific roles (objective kills for jungling, wards for support, etc) and depending on the queue times by role, players could be given Quests centered around the role needed at that moment",1470010199

A hero is not a leader and is not a rallying cry, those are not synonymous. A leader is a leader a hero is a hero.

The coc would have mostly helped the peasants and commoners with their tasks and whatnot, like all side quests in the game, maybe ot helps with stbolity, but to ke it seems like much more probably not, like it will just help that one person to go through another day and it matters very little when looking at the bigger context.",1470010202

"ethtrader","t5_37jgj","Waking up this morning with BTC down another # 2% to 556 EUR.
ETH/BTC rebounded a to 190 and ETC off its intraday highs now, the fever has passed for the time being.

So what do I make of this? you know my prior thinking, i think BTC is on its way to 500 so 50% of the move done. I don't know the reason. There are some articles about this on Coindesk about BTC pressed to have its own fork. As usual i don't care much for the reasons, whatever it is, the market showed some earlier technical weakness and 500 looks definitely possible soon.

Some people may wonder why ETH/BTC correlation didn't workout this time, well correlation doesn't mean causation and flow is more important. this type of observed correlation is valid when nothing happens or may be subject to trends itself... Thats why i use the KIS principle and to trade 1 stuff i believe its own chart is all you need so, for example don't buy ETH because you think BTC is going down. If you think BTC is going down, sell it !

so still bearish BTC and ETH here. BTC fiat value going down means ETH value down as well. its been like that since TheDAO hack [the reverse was true prior to the hack], and i expect it to continue. BTC 500 eur and ETH 7 eur still my first objective, based on TA mainly. We had multi-months rally in both BTC (18 months) and ETH (7 months). Rallies don't last forever. This correction started less than 5 weeks ago with TheDAO as a trigger, its duration will be in months not weeks.

*IF/When* we reach my targets, doesn't mean the bull trend will resume magically. But the risk reward will shift quite a bit, and the market may or may not find a medium or even long-term bottom, it depends on price action after we get there. There would be decent opportunities on the long side at least. Bear markets are not one-way either.

ETHEUR weekly chart

3 bearish engulfing candles, massive RSI divergence, MACD dead cross from high level, DMI overbought -&gt; bearish
MA10 W may turning bearish soon, and MA10 has acted as resistance (on a closing basis) for 4 candles now... 
7 EUR is April/may lows.

BTCEUR weekly chart
https://dwq4do82y8xi7.cloudfront.net/x/lodk1TqS/
no massive divergence here so not as bearish than ETH.
still this year's high near Jan14  resistance, i.e. we had achieved a major target in BTC, and this technical correction should continue to 500 EUR at least I believe as we are still quite far from the moving average on the monthly chart:

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; To be sexually attracted to children requires some kind of crazy unnatural brain chemistry that tells you it's okay, even when you know it's not.

I read a theory that suggested an evolutionary explanation of paedophilia. The idea being that children are more likely to survive (and thus repoduce themselves) when there are more people interested in keeping them alive. Paedophiles have a very keen interest in keeping children alive (assuming we are defining paedophiles as sexually attracted to children whereas child molesters abuse children). So its possible that an attraction to children could be advantageous if it was present in a subset of a population. 

Either way though doesn't really matter. What I think needs to happen is finding ways for people who are paedophiles to come forward and get help, rather than just pretend they don't exist until they do something horrific. ",1470010203

If you're having problems finding minions to last hit because youre team is grouped, go to another lane or use your abilities (pro's use double distortion to clear a wave all the time) 

If you just magically start sucking at csing once lane phase is over, I can't help ya other than to say practice? I mean, if you know how to cs in lane phase it should only get EASIER to cs the later the game goes, not harder.

If you are simply having trouble finding time to cs given that you're always roaming (this can happen with picks like lb or quinn because you're busy trying to make picks and make plays elsewhere) you need to temper your aggression with awareness. If you fail a gank and your mid lane got shoved and you missed a wave, you can't just sit in a bush waiting for someone to walk by, or sit in a bush hoping to get another gank attempt off. 

Discipline to realize that a gank isn't there is necessary, otherwise you're simply giving the enemy tea man advantage.

People say this a lot, but if you're not in the middle of a gank/or taking an objective, you NEED to farm.

* If it could be Dany, why is Jon needed? Meaning, if the Others only need dragons to kill them or alike, (Team Fire) then Jon certainly was never needed to be half Targaryen. She could be the hero... 
* ""But he's needed to ride a dragon"" ok strong point. But why make him half and half? He could just be one of the dead kids found alive.

In short his half and half will not just be what binds the two pieces of Ice and Fire, but I think something greater. A point I don't see a answer to yet. I've often thought...If Dany dies...that's a huge reason for him to be who he is. ... 

On AA and TPTWP --- the show doesn't make them separate...so my vote is they are the same. But pic up TWoIAF, and it will make you question all of it!

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt; I am fine with nice guy shaming in that nice guy ism is dysfunctional behavior, but (social) punishment only works (as a corrective behavior) if the person you are punishing knows why they are being punished.

I have actually considered giving this kind of feedback before -- not specifically to NGs, but to dudes in general. However, my disdain for unsolicited advice has usually prevented me from doing so. I mean, in extreme cases, I will be blunt, e.g., ""Listen. I told you that I didn't want you to walk me to my door. I'd been drinking, and I just didn't want you to. I'm mad that you not only disrespected that wish, but proceeded to enter my apartment after I'd told you goodnight. Consent is important to me, and I felt like you were ignoring my clearly-stated wishes to be left alone.""

Or perhaps, ""Did you really think I would respond positively to 'negging'? Like, in what universe did you think I'd ever want to see you again if you made fun of my singing (which, by the way, is perfectly on key)?""

Hopefully, hearing that will help them do better next time.

But an example of unsent unsolicited advice is:

""You asked me some super interesting questions, which almost made me feel like you were really interested in me... except you never listened to any of the answers, which made me think you were just checking boxes or something.""

I feel like this kind of advice WOULD help a guy change an annoying social behavior... but I also felt like wasn't my place to make a comment like that. Thoughts? ",1470010206

I don't care how we get the money now, especially when Republicans are always flushed with cash (maybe not Trump this time but other down ballot candidates still are). Unless Democrat is the majority in the Congress and we have a more sympathetic Supreme Court, how do you think Citizen United could be reversed? What would voting Jill Stein do? 

And while the fact that Bernie not accepting super PAC money is honorable, it's nowhere near enough to support down ballot candidates. 

This is a team work and Hillary is now the (future) leader. You can take your purity pride however you want. I want Citizen United to be reversed and I believe this is the way.

It's pretty well know that the institution of psychiatry has always been about persecuting people (they were still doing forced sterilizations in the 90s ffs, and even if it's just a coincidence that all psyche meds cause sexual dysfunction it's probably viewed as a happy coincidence by psychiatry). They may have convinced everyone that they've changed but they've been convincing the public that their new treatment is legitimate this time I swear for 200 years. Pills are the latest treatment in a long history of duping the public into believing that they've changed after it's proven that their previous treatment was just outright mutilation. I think it's foolish to think this time it's different, for the first time in history they're actually trying to help? Come on, the public thought they were trying to help every time, fool me once.


I'd say it's more to do with profiteering, as it always has been. There's a lot of money to be made when big pharmaceutical teams up with psychiatry to gain access to their captive market. I'm sure most corporations would love to have access to a market where customers are forced to buy their products.


There's also the eugenics problem. Eugenics is still the most highly funded area of study in psychiatry, and it wasn't very long ago when they were gassing patients as part of their eugenics program.

Cats are considered cute because of the encephalitic coefficient (small head to big eye ratio); and dogs because they are handy. This is kind of perverse and sad though.  The problem with animals is that it is hard to create a true emotional connection. A dog's eye tracking (years of co-evolution) or a cats smearing pheromones (claiming ownership) is mistaken as love/affection.  Does the guy in Kazakhstan who screws his goat truly love the goat or does he perceive it as an object (masturbatory substitute)? Maybe the problem lies in ""meaning"".  The monk has a goal, and is devoted to what he thinks is a meaningful life.  Often true depression, as differentiated from sadness, sorrow, or grief has a tinge of melancholy and despair.  Like the retired widow who no longer works and doesn't have family, hence her identity and life purpose is confused or non-existent and the suffocating empty void of her life makes her depressed.   In a world where we don't have to hunt in groups anymore, are human bonds still desirable for only happiness and the creation of meaning?

Your brain says ""go even faster"" despite the fact that you're at max speed, the system says ""no"". Your brain repeats ""GO FASTER"" with more intent and imagining yourself doing it, and at a certain point your brain signals will override the system's limits, because they're more powerful.

When creating the leaven, the starter that you will use to mix your dough, you have two variables: how much of the previous starter to keep and how long after feeding to mix the dough. I usually keep very little starter, perhaps a tablespoon or whatever coats the container, and let it sit overnight. You can also keep more starter and only wait a few hours. Either way, either right as its volume is at its peak or soon after is a good sweet spot.

Using a more or less ripe leaven will then have downstream affects on your bulk fermentation and proof. All of these factors add up to how sour, nutty, complex, etc your loaf is.

Hard to give an exact answer. I just think of it primarily in terms of balancing time and temperature at the various life cycles of the fermentation. Use your senses. A leaven that will make a nice distinctive sourdough should smell good in a ripe fruit sort of way and be very active.",1470010214

It doesn't change the fact that sexual assault is a MUCH graver offense than petty theft, and that in no way does sexual assault provide food for a starving person.  Which was ***your*** original line of thought, not mine:

&gt;What if they were sexually harassing people? What should be done in this case? You couldn't really say ""Well, they don't care, they know the risk, its not going to change their life, they're going to go for weaker targets."" You'll probably respond with ""but they have to do this to eat"" but that is not the case, there are other means of living.

That's literally putting words in my mouth and acting like you've won the argument because of it.  It's a terrible analogy  (regardless of whether you said rape or sexual assault) and makes absolutely ***NO*** sense.

These are your words:

&gt;I think it could change their actions. If they were punched 10 times that day, maybe they would stop and seek employment elsewhere.

Take a step back and look at them.  You literally think you can beat someone into rehabilitation.  My point about punching you went over your head completely.  It has nothing to do with you being an aggressor or not, it's about the magic power of these punches to beat someone into submission or into having a life-changing epiphany.

That will never happen.  You will sooner teach these kids to attack in groups, to seek weaker targets, to get smarter about stealing before one of them says ""Gee, maybe I should go seek real employment somewhere.""  You must be deluded if you think these kids have options like this.  What third world country to you know of that provides these great employment opportunities to minors and well as adults with no education and a reputation?

Now look.  I feel everyone there who is dealing with the petty theft has a right to defend themselves and their property.  Don't think for a *second* that you will somehow be changing these kids' lives by beating them.  Go read the comments in this thread.  People saying they would kill kids, beat the shit out of kids, saying they deserve grenades put in their mouths (someone actually said this) all because they took something they committed petty theft.  Forget defending yourself, these people actually think it's ok to do this to a kid in a third world country if they took their wallet or cellphone.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Aside just how amazing this episode was I have to go even further and say holy crap both VA's were so amazing during the entire self-loathing and confession and everything. Like I know it's all been amazing the whole series but this was a whole other level just wow.

Why does Subaru even like Emelia at this point? It almost feels like the witch's power/curse or whatever on him has him fixated on her. She's quite literally done very little for him this entire time yet he's obsessed with her. Of course that's how the heart works I suppose. It's actually kind of nice to see the consistency in that with how ""real"" it is.

Interesting that the whale is gluttony though it makes sense. It's mentioned in the manga before here so I don't think it's a spoiler but supposedly the reason Betelgeuse things Subaru could be Pride is because Pride is the only apostle that he hasn't seen/met before. Very interesting that Puck actually knows about the apostles and that the whale is Gluttony, he clearly knows a lot more than he lets on. Puck also is evidently basically immortal/eternal and spirits have no effective life-span which means he's basically ancient. Somehow Emelia's contract with him seems to be relating to preventing Puck from destroying the world and her failure of the contract or otherwise death means he'll destroy the world. I have a feeling she's put a lot into the contract, far more than we ever realize. It's no small feat to have a contract with such an insanely powerful spirit and her existence/contract is supposedly the only reason for Puck to live basically. Also slightly interesting that Puck seems to despise humans in general and has some knowledge or experience with Satella but that could simply be knowing the rumors/stories about her supposed strength.

Fun note for anyone complaining about the Pack/Puck translation get your pitchforks out if you're in support of Pack even more since the official english LN release uses Puck as well, granted that's not a huge surprise. The dialogue feels very weird without all the honorifics too.",1470010216

If you've ever been there, the town looks like something out of the 18th century (because it is I suppose).  Very steep, windy an narrow streets with tiny little buildings.  In the past 15 years yuppification had hit the town in full force.... but I digress

Well, there was 6.03 inches of rain in the hour before hand and the flood hit with incredible speed.  I know one guy on the Baltimore County side of the river who saw the river was getting a bit high and decided to go home... by the time he had his keys and stood up the river had suddenly risen 6 feet and had swamped Frederick Road (MD 144) - it took under 3 minutes.

I live about 4 miles away in Baltimore County and could not *believe* the insane amount of water coming out of the sky.   It was literally like a 10 mile wide hose had been poised over the area and then turned on.... and we ""only"" got about 4.2 inches.  (Edit:  4.2 inches in about an hour.

"tarot","t5_2qhu4","Beautiful art! I like this card as well as the Moon card; however, I'll toss my two cents into the pot on the gender issue. As the vast majority of those who use Tarot are female, they will surely love the female gender dominating the deck. There are several decks that have gone this route for certain. For me, the balance is completely lost in this fashion; not only in the ever important trumps, but the court cards. We can consider the trumps to be archetypes and forget the gender completely, but if the universe consisted of only the female gender, we would not be here discussing it.

 As the story of the trump cards pair the Magician and High Priestess as ideal inner dualities, along with the Emperor and Empress being outer dualities in the form of perpetual creation and portrayals of the opposite sex, it's difficult for some to comprehend sticking by classic interpretations. I've seen quite a few Wiccan decks that nearly refuse to portray any males whatsoever except maybe a token mythical woodland god or something along those lines, which is why I can't relate to those in particular.

I mean, even mistakenly dubbing it a feminist approach isn't accurate as the definition for that ideal would ultimately be equality between the genders. There can be no equality with only one gender portrayed within the deck. Otherwise, I love the artwork!",1470010217

When we talk about the relationship between the endemic underclass in the United States and criminality [edit: or death by cop or a lot of other causes of early death] we simply can't seperate it from race because the conditions faced by poor blacks are qualitatively different than those faced by poor people of other ethnicities. When social scientists attempt to compare different impoverished cohorts they constantly run into the issue that no other group has the same combination of density (de facto segregation in housing), poverty, and being structurally underserved making comparisons across ethnicities nearly impossible. The closest comparison that can be made is with American Indian populations.

"blackops3","t5_2tl1c","I enjoyed playing CoD 4, and still do from time to time.  
MW2 was, and still is, excellent.  
MW3... was alright (I put quite a lot of time into the game- I got to 10th prestige then quit), but the connection quality made it feel like my skills as a player weren't being rewarded like they should have been.  

So I stopped buying new games after that.  I didn't buy Black Ops 1, even though it sounded interesting, initially for lack of funds but seeing the stat chart (i.e. every gun being a clone of another in some way) solidified my decision.

Remembering MW3's bad experience, I played new CoD games on free weekends and the betas when they were available.  Black Ops 2 had unsatisfactory connection quality, Ghosts had that artificial RAM limit, bad maps, and guns that weren't all that differentiated, and Advanced Warfare was unstable and never had a free weekend on Steam as far as I can recall.

Black Ops 3 sold me on the beta- connection quality was excellent and the guns were fun enough.  I'm a rush player, so with the wallrunning initially granting a great advantage over those who stayed on the ground and the (what seemed to be) good hit detection, I was sold on the game.

Now it's a chore to play (the only time I have fun in this game is when I'm either moving very fast and using the Vesper like a better shotgun, or using the SVG-100 like the railgun from Quake), but there's nothing quite like the design of CoD out there right now.  
Unfortunately, getting cheated out of kills when my shot clearly hit the enemy, or getting killed solely because my opponent happened to have a Marshal 16 on standby really tends to sour the deal- the inconsistency in lag really doesn't help.

Titanfall tried but failed to capture the play-your-way philosophy of MW1/2, Battlefield has high TTKs and a greater dependence on teamwork, TF2 and Overwatch are the same way but with even less customization and characters that are supposed to be big draws but end up being forgettable at best.

If you want to recapture the magic of CoD, you need to go back to the early Infinity Ward days- you'll stop losing what should have been a fair fight, with the caveat that you'll die more against people who have better positioning than you do.  But that tradeoff is more than fair, and with some time spent you'll be able to reliably do that yourself.",1470010218

"asoiafcirclejerk","t5_2tvge","""Ser? My lady?"" said Podrick. ""Is a broken man an outlaw?""

""More or less,"" Brienne answered.

Septon Maribald disagreed. ""More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sand piper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil mestuffiven by greed, sourced by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house they were born until the day some lord came around to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with stripes of hide. Brothers march with brothers, fathers with sons, friends with friends. They've heard the songs and stories, and go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the glory and wealth they will win. War seems a fine adventure, greater than the most of them will ever know. 

""Then they get a taste of battle.

For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others may go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break on his hundred and first. Brothers watch brothers die, fathers lose their sons, and friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after being gutted by an axe. 

""They see the lord that led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when it is still half healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water. 

""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron half helm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world...

And the man breaks.

He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. the broken man lives from day to day, meal to meal, more beast than man.

The edits were good, and I can't complain about the quality, though the gameplay itself seemed a little fuzzy, might have just been me.

The story in and of itself wasn't too interesting, at least not for me (though I'll chalk that up to not believing in supernatural phenomenon, unlike yourself) and I've yet to watch any others, but like I said I still watched the whole thing, because your delivery made me feel like staying. You don't sound half dead, and you don't sound annoying. The background music was good, as it added a nice beat without drowning you out, as good background music should.

All in all, I suck at this, but that's besides the point. Point is I thought the video was great. Nice energy, decent story, good voice, and above average (damn ear rape) editing.

Your candidate got outplayed. He was my candidate, too, though I was never seriously involved. All I did was vote. I was certain that Clinton was going to be the nominee all along.

Though Hill's tactics were vicious, it was no less so when Obama was running against her. Yet, Obama managed to win. And Clinton did what was right for the party (and I think the country) in the aftermath of that victory by strongly supporting Obama's bid afterwards.

I have confidence that if Sanders had also pulled an upset victory, both Clintons would be on his team. Because despite their drive to win at all costs, ultimately they try to do what's right for the Democratic party. Just as they did in 2008, even Clinton's die hard supporters would have joined Sander's machine.

But the shoe is on the other foot. It's depressing that so many of Sander's most vocal supporters are unwilling to join with their fellow progressives to stop an insane, racist demagogue from acquiring the most powerful military on Earth.

Equally I'm against things like the death penalty for the most inhumane people on Earth, so this is quite a left wing attitude which not everyone will agree with. 

Life is precious and short, nobody has the right to choose who/what you share your time with and wiping out an entire species seems like an extreme reaction to that philosophy...

Yes, MTV no doubt benefited from Michael Jackson's reputation as a singer, no doubt, but he wasn't the ""King of Pop,"" yet.  He was just another big singer in the early 80s looking for more ways to push his brand.

MTV's early years made a few stars, like Men Without Hats and Toni Basil, so a good video (and neither ""The Safety Dance"" or ""Mickey"" were very impressive) could turn a star into a superstar.

Was ""Billie Jean"" groundbreaking and iconic?  You bet.  Did it have a major effect on MTV?  Absolutely.  Did it help Michael Jackson's album sales?  No doubt.  

Music videos were essentially commercials for the album before the Youtube era.  We think of them now as separate entities because we can access them whenever we want to on youtube.  But before, even the most popular music video would show up maybe once an hour on MTV, and in its early years, people would either have to wait for it to come on, or just buy the album.

In my estimation, MTV would be worse without MJ putting out ""Billie Jean,"" ""Thriller,"" and ""Beat It"" at just the right time, but MJ benefited greatly from the exposure that MTV provided as well.",1470010222

For CS:GO, yes there will always be cheaters, but trust me Gfinity really do care/listen. Now I stopped working for them over a year ago, but they do deserve credit where its due. The rules were made about the GOTV and the time zones because lets be honest, holding up an entire cup to check through demos when many people request them is not something any tournament does. 

As for the CEVO permissions, that's something im not aware of as thats new since I left. However again, note that these admins put a lot of time in to trying to help, they are being spammed by so many people at once, sometimes it genuinely takes time to physically respond when solving 20+ problems at once. 

I have honestly met some amazing admins through Gfinity, I have seen some great ones come and go on to much bigger things.

Modern unions can often try to hold the rest of society to ransom, seeking special privileges. The Ottoman Empire disallowed its Muslim citizens the use of the printing press due to the objections of calligraphers of the Ulama (who I think can be considered as a union here) who would have been out of a job if the Printing press became widespread. This caused centuries of civilisation lag. Granted, the calligraphers wielded a religious authority, which would not exist in your utopia.

* It did commit genocide, therefore, it did commit the crime

* therefore, it is an organization that is created to commit a crime (further Nazism), and is found guilty of said crime.

&gt;  I've kept my eyes on a lot of libs and going from ~20fps to ~40fps in dbmon without a significant rewrite is completely unheard of

Well, don't have the case for dbmon and javascript, but look at some erlang/elixir and golang benchmarks. sometimes only fixing one string function/lib can be game changer.

&gt; I get that if you're an ember dev, you'll be happy with anything you can get since you're pretty much locked in

You are completly wrong on this. I may be locked in in old projects, but new can be on anything i decide. That is why i am always looking at react, vue, elm, etc.

I won't say ember is the best framework. Its not the best, until I specify what for and for whom. For me is my favorite framework in general. Period. But if i say i am not interested in elm, for example, I would be lying.

&gt; First it's going to be super fast, then it's not the priority, then it's prioritizing compat, then you're saying there's some fundamental issue with how glimmer1 deals with ddau and routing...

To me, in my mind, if they rewrite the engine at this stage only for performance, it would be dumb. Ember as it is, its not the fastest, but its also not the slowest. It would only make sense, if performance, along with other features. Completing Ember's *new* workflow is my main point of interest, really.

To sum it up, as its important to stress that i respect what you are saying, I will say that for me, now, ember can be slow as molasses if it wants. But when the engine is the default one and completed, then yes, I expect performance ALONG with other things, to have improved significantly.",1470010227

According to [this site](http://www.drgreene.com/qa-articles/white-patches-skin/) from a pediatrician, sun can often bring out small white patches and spots and is common in children who have psoriasis or eczema. From the site:

&gt;Children with this extremely common condition [Pityriasis Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pityriasis_alba) develop uneven, round or oval patches after sun exposure. The patches are dry with very fine scales. Varying from 1 to 2 inches in diameter, they are most common on the face (cheeks), neck, upper trunk, and upper arms of children 3 to 16 years old.

&gt;These are completely benign, similar to a mild form of eczema. They are most common in children with dry skin.

Another option is something called [tinea versicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinea_versicolor). From the site:

&gt;This is a mild, superficial fungal infection, somewhat similar to ringworm (true ringworm can also result in white patches). Since the affected skin doesn’t change color well with sun exposure, it usually becomes apparent as white patches during the summer months. In the winter it may seem to disappear, or even seem to become slightly darkened patches as the surrounding skin gets paler (this is where the name versicolor comes from).

The site goes on to say that this is most common in people 15 - 30 years of age, is a chronic condition, and recurs easily. Aside from the appearance (there's a photo on the site) there are no adverse health affects to it.",1470010231

If something was done it cant be undone, you cant erase history with flipped switch because geopolitical situation changed in the local area. The only thing that is uncertain is in any story who will get into power and for how long. Just look at the Roman Empire do you think the Roman Empire history was erased because it collapsed no... did we all forget about soviet communism when it collapsed no we didnt, the fact is you are expecting geopolitical situations will never change in Elite and you wish to enforce this view on others we are not forcing anyone to join us or blocking anyone to join ""their home""  Your argument for Eranin might stick with any inhabited system in the bubble there is always somebody who will be pissed something is not how the imagined, the thing is that Eranin only had a Community goal to fight against the feds like many systems did. Many commanders started story in Eranin and left it on its own to seek fortune elsewhere while we stayed there all the time and worked for the interests of Eranin as it is in our lore and now long forgoten sons of the independence war find out that the balance of power was switch to our faction and all the hell broke lose how we destroyed the community, but didnt think about it maybe the citizens of Eranin decided to change the goverment to something else than just communism and still keep independence under TCForces and Alliance protection. 
And you are correct those 2 points does sound ridicolous to us, we are what we are and this is what we plan to stay. We are not bound to single planet and we confirm our origins are not from Azeban planet, we have our own identity its same as i would force you change your nickname in game to EPP supporter because you it hurts my background lore, if you get what i mean :) As about that we didnt know importance of the system of community is not really true because we know the importance and we stayed in system cause it was important to us. The thing is the community of EPP supporters forgot the system in mess and decided to follow the money trail somewhere else where they pay more while we fought the wars even after the community left the system in constant wars so thats why we decided to step up. 
We saw the movie its very cool and we showed the support. We are not enemy of the EPP  and never inteded to be but if the community that left them become too much nostalgic and rather support war in the sector this will make just another turmoil that nobody wants to see. We won the election and the community should respect the choice of Eranin Citizens.
P.S: Why didnt this community that think EPP is so important try to adopt EPP and support it to end wars and skirmishes even after independence war as player faction and keep working for it ? This is how they would show how this system is important to your community but because there was none until somebody to check in for a visit all of sudden all are shocked how that could happen. :)",1470010231

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I think the biggest thing you need to do is learn more. There are a couple things you say that make me believe you are doing them because you heard they were a good idea, but not sure why.

1) At your income level, a Roth may not be the best option. I know that goes against everything this sub is about, but it isn't always the best thing to do, regardless of what people say here.

2) Your student debt is very small compared to your income. You can easily contribute and pay down the debt fairly easily.

3) I don't think you really understand the strength of compound interest. At your age, you will be able to see some SERIOUS compounding. Dollars put away today are worth so much more than you realize. 

4) The biggest reason for maxing your 401(k) is that you cannot play catchup. Each year has a max and that's it. If you miss it, it's over. Also, it's SUCH a huge benefit that the gov't caps how much money people can put into it. Think about that for a second...

Now, all of this isn't to say you should or should not max it. While you need to do some more reading, your knowledge is FAR ahead of your peers, and because of that, as long as you continue a decent regular savings plan and don't do stuff out of panic (buy/sell) you will be just fine.

What's not real is someone telling me they are a woman when they were clearly born a man. Or when someone wants to tell me they had homosexual sex with their vagina with someone else's dick, that is clearly wrong by all definitions of the word.

Example one: no cap.

Low load: 120 FPS

High load: 80 FPS

Example two: 80 FPS cap

Low load: 80 FPS

High load: 80 FPS

If anything, disabling the cap should improve performance. The GPU needs a split second to adjust power settings. 

If you don't have a cap, and you run into a high load situation, your GPU won't have to do anything, because it's already working at maximum power.

If you have a cap, your GPU will throttle down the power during low load situations, and if you run into a high load situation, it'll have to first adjust its power consumption first.

I mean, the guys that design GPU drivers are pretty smart, and you probably won't feel any difference, but there's definitely some potential for hitching right there.

The short answer is that you can use your Ubuntu install disc and GPartEd (GNOME Partition Editor).  That should get you on the right track, but the long answer is you should have backups and understand how to use GPartEd before you do it.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","Aye, but the question was humanity at their peak. Everything that humans have the potential to be. 


And humanity must have some ability to survive on its own because humans in some form, lasted *until the end of the universe*. That wasn't simply down to the Doctor, and he himself calls humanity indomitable. Even under Dalek occupation, Earth had a resistance movement that would have eventually been successful to some degree. 

But I find it strange you bring up the Doctor saving Earth so often anyway. Don't you think Gallifrey has as much to owe the Doctor as Earth? Since, you know, Gallifrey wouldn't have survived as long as it did/had without the Doctor. 


But it really depends on what your view of the stage humanity would be facing off against the Time Lords. Early 21st Century? 23rd? 41st? And if you're using fictional universes to draw inspiration from then you have to choose one. Star Fleet and the Federation eventually gain time travelling technology of their own and become incredibly capable. The Imperium of *Warhammer 40k* could almost certainly give the Time Lords, and probably the Daleks, a run for their money in terms of sheer firepower. 


But if you are saying we can't know what the peak of their potential is then what is the point of the question? Surely the answer would be a resounding 'We don't know'. ",1470010238
"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Well, not quite. What they do is prevent the pig's genome from being able to produce any pancreas cells, for example. The whole chimera is a mix of human and porcine DNA, so most parts of it will express human and porcine proteins, and thus be a mix. But when the pancreas is developing, it turns out the pig's genome has been modified to prevent it from being able to produce the kinds of cells it needs to make to make a pancreas. So only the human DNA is left to take care of the job, and thus you get a (mostly, except for the blood vessels) human pancreas. 

So in other words, the chimera's brain *is* affected. It's not a fully porcine brain, but a mix. What this will mean for it, we have no idea, and considering we actually already share a shitton of DNA with pigs (and everything else that's alive on the planet), it's really not clear that this a meaningful rubric for deciding whether a creature is a member of the moral community. But certainly there's a chance that a human-pig chimera could be much different than a pig, and we should keep that in mind as we go down this path. ",1470010238

&gt; [2.] The cooler and sometimes the more expensive models have a custom PCB for better power delivery. It is basically a matter of looks and cooling performance. GTX 970's all run fairly cooler so get something cheap. Paying over $240 for one is silly.

The GTX 970 you listed runs at a lower core clock. Would it be better to spend a little more for the additional speed?


Also, why do you suggest a more expensive SSD with the same capacity? What is the advantage of your suggested SSD?

Finally an additional question: How much capacity on an SSD do I really need? I really only plan on having my OS on there; that should help with boot speeds correct?

With that said, my anxiety in general isn't *too* bad. I don't get panic attacks or anything that inhibits my ability to do well in school. If you do, then benzos may be worth it *despite* the impaired cognitive abilities.

Also, from what I've read, diazepam is one of the more hypnotic benzos, and may impair memory and cognition more than alprazolam (I've never tried Xanax, maybe someone could comment on this).

I think if you have really bad anxiety and you need Xanax, then you need Xanax. Abstaining from it would probably make you do worse. Just don't start taking way more than you need.",1470010244

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is completely untrue and a HUGE reason why people keep killing off venomous snakes for absolutely no reason!

Cottonmouth snakes are some of the calmest venomous snakes you can encounter. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=314N7xIeRR8&amp;feature=youtu.be) to watch what happens almost always when you see a cottonmouth. I've seen plenty of cottonmouths in the wild because they're native to my county and mostly have had them flee. And whenever someone does get bitten (which, additionally, [less people are bitten by snakes each year than by dogs](http://ufwildlife.ifas.ufl.edu/venomous_snake_faqs.shtml)) it is usually from them stepping on the snakes head by accident. 

Additionally, most people bitten by venomous snakes are bitten trying to kill the snake, meaning the snake is totally justified in biting you if you're trying to cut it's head off with a shovel. 

tl;dr: Cottonmouths are not aggressive and venomous snakes aren't trying to kill you. ",1470010245

"news","t5_2qh3l","There's no use man. Some people just have their minds made up, despite the fact that golden retrievers have aome of the highest rates of attacks on humans, you'd never see them pegged as aggressive. It's because they aren't but they've earned a reputation though popular culture that can endure the rare attack here and there that is possible with any dog. Pits unfortunately since they are such powerful machines have been in the hands of irresponsible people who really created a stigma around them that is unfair. 


Even fighting pits are often able to be rehabilitated and are great family pets. Having them around other dogs or pets is another story, but when it comes to humans? Pits are some of the most naturally loving dogs there are. Other breeds are FAR  more likely to be standoffish and aggressive toward people that aren't their master: 

Rotts, dobies, acd all have more of atendency to be protecting and therefore ""aggressive"" toward people. Pits are much more likely to be aggressive toward animals. ",1470010246
"Games","t5_2qhwp","Definitely agree with you on most of these points. Especially with regards to the increased cast size - the additional characters made it feel like I wasn't paying enough attention to leveling up some characters, and it also made the story feel kind of rushed, since it didn't have time to talk about each character in true depth. I think the battle system that discourages killing is at least somewhat realistic though: If you have someone that's so wounded that they no longer pose a threat, there's no reason to always execute them in real life.  This would make more sense if there was a ""surrender"" mechanic for the enemy though. Gameplay-wise it does make combat kind of annoying at times, since you'll often have big blocks of enemies in the way that you don't usually want to waste time killing. 

edit: a surrender mechanic on your own side would probably help too. If you had a low hp unit, for example, that was wasting turns, you could have them surrender or retreat from the battle by bringing them to the edge of the battlefield or something",1470010246

In Example 003_Controller_SimplePointer:

When both controllers pointers hit an object at the same time (same object or not), you get massive stutter when rotating your head until at least one pointer is no longer hitting an object.

In Example 011_Camera_HeadSetCollisionFading:

Unity3D 5.4.0 is no longer beta, therefor having the Head Fader by default be located on the Camera (Head) instead of the Camera (Eye) will do nothing but cause confusion for everyone who will be moving on to the latest version of Unity for VR development. ( Me being one of them. )

1.  Try saving as a different Word format (.doc instead of .docx, or vice versa).  

2. Install [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and use it to convert the Word document to an EPUB, then upload that to Amazon.  Calibre is a really useful tool for managing ebooks, and I think it's an essential item in the self-publisher's toolkit, so learning to use it won't be time wasted.

3. Go for formatting by hand: the [Guido Henkel guide](http://guidohenkel.com/2010/12/take-pride-in-your-ebook-formatting/) recently discussed is a very comprehensive treatment.  I know this looks like a lot of work, but it will give you the best outcome if you plan to be publishing more than once or twice.

* [Boku wa Mari no Naka](http://myanimelist.net/manga/36267/Boku_wa_Mari_no_Naka), more on the psychological drama side. 

If you're also interested in stories with simply crossdressed characters:

* [Prunus Girl](http://myanimelist.net/manga/14115/Prunus_Girl), really hilarious. In full throttle slap stick comedy sort of way, think [Sabagebu!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20709/Sabagebu).
* [Ookami Shounen wa Kyou mo Uso wo Kasaneru](http://myanimelist.net/manga/85802/Ookami_Shounen_wa_Kyou_mo_Uso_wo_Kasaneru) cute little comedy romance.
* [Himegoto: Juukyuusai no Seifuku](http://myanimelist.net/manga/43415/Himegoto__Juukyuusai_no_Seifuku). Drama, has two characters very lost in their gender identity. Warning: Sexuality is the topic; so there is a good deal of nudity.

"DPPTinkering","t5_3arlb","Heya! /u/Powercleanqueen hit the nail on the head, but I want to hammer one point home - this really isn't really a prompt, and it's likely why it hasn't gotten a response.  What you've basically established is that you want to play a pole-vaulter in Rio, and you've given us kinks and a profile (which is a good thing to do). But there's no real sense of story here, no real indication of your writing ability, or what your character is like. What you have here feels like the OOC part of the prompt that goes after the couple of IC paragraphs, the part where you write from your character's point of view. That may be just what you need here - a paragraph about what it's like to be the focus of 15,000 people in the stands just during the qualifiers, much less the main event, what it means to be in the Olympic village, how your character is reacting to that. Is he cocky? Is he shy? Do all the lights distract him from the event, or does he block everything out and get in the zone? If you want people to want to write with your pole-vaulter, you need to make them interested in your pole-vaulter, and right know we don't know anything about him.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Go on indeed.com and check out entry level jobs. Read the descriptions and decide if those duties are something you'd like to do. Then read up on the career trajectory for those jobs - i.e. ""project manager career trajectory"" or something. See what kinds of roles you could be promoted into. Then read up on those job descriptions and see if those sound fun.

You're only 16, so you have a ton of wiggle room. However, I've done a good amount of interviewing and recruiting, so I will say that the earlier you start to ""write your own story"" and build your personal brand, the better. College is where it really starts to matter. It's excellent that you're thinking about this stuff so early.

A few jobs that you have a high likelihood of getting hired right out of college are:
- Marketing Assistant (this has good career growth potential and it's creative)
- Sales associate (you need to have a social, extroverted personality for this, but you can make alot of money if you're good at it)
- Business development associate/assistant (big money making potential here, especially if you get an entry level job at a professional services firm. Law firms are hiring).
- Personal/executive assistant - easy job to get, but difficult to advance

If you find an entry level job that strikes you as something you'd enjoy, set that as a target and then build your class schedule around it. For example, if you think marketing sounds cool, take a bunch of communications, economics, writing, marketing, public relations classes in high school and college. Do extracurricular stuff like writing blog posts or joining the school newspaper.

You don't have to decide your whole career now. Most people in younger generations change jobs frequently and have plenty of time to decide what they wanna do for the rest of their lives. But the important thing is to set yourself up to be well-qualified to enter the work force when you graduate. Because you won't really know what you like to do until you try it. Starting with one of the jobs I've listed above will give you universally-needed experience so that you can enter any industry you want.

Also, pro tip: While you're in school, take online courses/use youtube to learn how to use various software platforms like a pro. Like the Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft Office (especially Excel). if you learn how to code you'll be even more of an exemplary job candidate.

I hope this helps! PM me with any questions you might have :)

&gt; Pepper Hamilton investigators urged the school to expand amnesty to sexual conduct code violations; the federal government told all U.S. universities in 2011 that conduct policies may have a chilling effect on reporting sexual assault.

&gt; Stefanie Mundhenk, a former Baylor student who The Associated Press is identifying because she has publicly blogged about Baylor&amp;#039;s investigation into her 2015 rape allegations, told the AP that she was never threatened by conduct code violations but was repeatedly questioned about her sexual history.

The GPU core can hit 1300 undervolted with a non annoying fan profile. 

Long story short. These reference 480's are actually pretty good! Aftermarket cards won't buy you much or any performance improvements over the reference cards. They'll cost you more money though and be harder to fit inside many cases.",1470010259

In the movie it's assumed that Vision, when he ""burned"" Ultron out of the Internet at the start of the battle, also managed to wipe out all remote copies of Ultron everywhere in the world.

They need to take a page from Blizzard (I can't believe I just said that) and Wizards of the Coast; their combined communication with upcoming projects is always clear, and they (at least on the surface) seem to really take the communities feedback to heart.

*****
&gt; AUSTIN, Texas - The sexual assault scandal that took down Baylor University&amp;#039;s president and revered football coach also found a problem with a bedrock of the school&amp;#039;s faith-based education: a student conduct code banning alcohol, drugs and premarital sex that may have driven some victims into silence.

&gt; Pepper Hamilton investigators urged the school to expand amnesty to sexual conduct code violations; the federal government told all U.S. universities in 2011 that conduct policies may have a chilling effect on reporting sexual assault.

&gt; Stefanie Mundhenk, a former Baylor student who The Associated Press is identifying because she has publicly blogged about Baylor&amp;#039;s investigation into her 2015 rape allegations, told the AP that she was never threatened by conduct code violations but was repeatedly questioned about her sexual history.

"ChronicPain","t5_2rdpj","By the time I decided to have my microdiskectomy for my L4-5 herniation, I was beyond ready to get the surgery.  I was in horrible pain and I was starting to lose feeling in my feet, which caused me to fall down my stairs when my feet gave out. 

Make sure you have really good shoes for walking after your surgery.  My progress got exponentially better after I bought negative heel Earth Shoes sneaks and a pair of Crocs.  I don't know what is out there now in negative heel shoes that are comfy (my surgery was in 2006), but I loved those Earth Shoes until I wore them out. 

Good luck with your surgery and recovery.  It makes me sad to think of someone so young dealing with this awful pain.  Work hard and carefully afterwards to keep it away.  It's hard once your body starts falling apart.  I herniated my disk when I was 41, and it's harder to bounce back when you're older.

CANWC is popular because it has a good, shitposty humour (which as you said is humour of most of the sub), updates frequently, has a clever storyline (which contains foreshadowing and an actual plotline, despite using mostly fan commands), and is an original idea, which many fanventures aren't.

*****
&gt; Facebook Inc.&amp;#039;s future cash flows and results could suffer a major blow if it loses a battle over new U.S. tax liabilities related to the transfer of its global operations to Ireland in 2010.

&gt; The IRS claims Facebook&amp;#039;s tax adviser Ernst &amp; Young LLP undervalued the company&amp;#039;s property as it was transferred to Facebook Ireland Holdings Ltd. by evaluating pieces of the online platform separately, according to court filings.

&gt; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t think Facebook is necessarily hiding anything, but it&amp;#039;s a fight over pricing,&amp;quot; said Stephen Hamilton, a tax lawyer in Philadelphia.

That night at little darlings (i.e.) I was sober I had too much fun - many lap dances, multiple girls for a lap dance - I felt like the king. I knew I was spending serious money, but it was so easy to spend.

The next morning I had $500 in my savings and realized that I had messed up. To cover up I told my parents I had changed my mind and was staying in the US. The problem was I had no plan - so I made one up, I was going to go to medical school and be a doctor.

&gt; And we afterwards continually remind each other of these things. And the wealthy among us help the needy; and we always keep together; and for all things wherewith we are supplied, we bless the Maker of all through His Son Jesus Christ, and through the Holy Ghost. **And on the day called Sunday,** all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need. **But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ our Saviour on the same day rose from the dead. For He was crucified on the day before that of Saturn (Saturday); and on the day after that of Saturn, which is the day of the Sun, having appeared to His apostles and disciples, He taught them these things,** which we have submitted to you also for your consideration.",1470010280

A loaf of bread from the cheap ones is $2.40. A thing of tortillas is 4-6$. A 3lb bag of cheese is about $7.40 and thats the cheap kind.

Healthy foods are often more expensive and harder to obtain. It is why there is an obesity crisis amongst the lower middle class and further down. Retailers make cheap junk-food more available and customers get it because it's a ""treat"". They can live in shit-shacks sharing a bedroom with 4 people but with a pack of oreos and some 7-up they can feel like kings if only for a moment.

The rampant abuse of the foodstamp system will not be solved until the job crisis is solved and price of junkfood goes up while healthy food goes down. Fucking ridiculous some of the produce we sell...

That said it pisses me the fuck off when I see someone using FS to buy junkfood and they reek of pot. Not that there is anything wrong with it but for fucksake if you can afford weed you should be spending that shit on something to help your situation.

Amsterdam is my second favourite city that I have ever visited (after Reykjavik). Do check out Albert Cuyp Market for some local treats.

Indonesian food is big too because the Dutch once ruled Indonesia. Needles to say, try the weed. Just avoid The Bulldog, its a tourist trap. Red Light District is a must (you can't take photos though, you will get arrested, don't forget that!)

I jump out of bed, throw on my pants and run. The halls of the ship have never felt this long. I trip as I run. My boots are on but untied. When I get to the entrance to the cockpit, I search my pockets for my ID.

“Don’t tell me I fucking left them back in the room!”

I finally find it stuck deep in a pocket on on my calf. I swipe and I enter the chaos.

“Come on, baby pull up. Pull up.” I hear Captain Starens yell out. All I can see through the front of the ship is white. I don’t know where we are, but we’re certainly not flying through space anymore. I know what the white was once we cut through it. We’re plummeting toward greens and blues. The white was clouds. We’re headed for the worst place possible. We’re crashing into Earth.

“We’re going down! Everybody brace yourselves!”

I sit in an empty seat against the wall, strap in, and pray. *Hail Mary, full of grace the Lord is with--*






*Help! Help!* I can’t see anything. I can’t hear anything. I know I’m yelling. I can feel my vocal chords vibrate in my throat. As my vision comes back I can only discern a few things. I’m on sand. I guess that makes this a beach if the textbooks are right. The ship is burning as it sinks into the water. All I can see is the “ey” part of the ship’s name Odyssey on the side. Am I the only survivor?

“Weaver!” Where is that coming from? Who’s calling my name?
“Weaver!” I see him coming up from down the beach. Soaked in water.

“Ridley?” I ask as he gives me a hand up. 

“Are you okay?”

“Yeah, I think so.”

“Good. Take this.” And he hands me a rifle.

“What happened? I woke up to the alarms sounding.”

The ship is fully underwater now. There’s a morbid silence unlike any I’ve ever heard before.

“Did anyone else make it?” I ask.

“It doesn’t seem so.” He says. There’s a noise and he whips around, hoisting his rifle to his shoulder. A noise came from the forest behind us. Some of the branches are still moving, yet to settle. We know where *it* was, but where has moved to. I lift my rifle.

“Keep quiet. It knows we’re here. It attacks when it hears a voice.” 

I can feel my heart thud in my chest. The horrors of the creatures that roam Earth have been told since the dawn of civilization. We learned about Earth in school. Once inhabited by people just like us, the flora of the planet overtook them and killed them all. It wasn’t long after that that the plants began to take a life different then what was once known.

“How do we get off this god forsaken planet, Weaver?”

“We need to launch the distress signal. If we can set up the beacon, we’ll just have to survive and wait it out. Shouldn’t be mroe than a week or two.”

“It’s still in the ship.”

“I’m the stronger swimmer. I’ll get it.”

Another rustiling from the forest. It doesn’t seem as close as the first “Be quick. Go.”

I can see him still holding his rifle to the woods as I dive into the water. I can’t see more than 20 yards ahead of me, but that’s enough to see the ship. I swim harder and faster with each stroke as I can feel my breath begin to go. I search for the door but can’t find it. My hands slide all over the side of ship, searching and searching, trying to move quicker. I come up for a breath.

“Get it?” Ridley yells out.

“No.”

“Hurry up!”

I dive back under and this time find the door on the first try. Water rushes in when I open the door, but stops just as quickly. I have enough air to walk around with water only up to my waist. Where’s the distress beacon? It should be right next to the pilot’s chair. I run over to the seat. It’s not there. What the fuck? Where is it? I search all over the cockpit. It’s not next to the co-pilots chair. I dive underwater. It’s not on the floor anywhere. Could it be in the dorming cabins? I trudge through the water and open the doors to the halls. Starens ID floats in the water. You never know if I made need to use it, so I take it. When I open the doors to the dormitory, I find what I’ve been looking for. I find the distress signal already blinking, having been sent out, clutched in the left hand of the chief engineer of The Odyssey, Charlie Kast. He has his right arm around Starens. They’re both dead. I pry the beacon out of Charlie’s hand and head out.

When I come out of the water, Ridley’s gone. No sign of him. It’s as if he was never here.

“Ridley!”

I look up the beach, nothing. Down the beach, nothing. Not even tracks as if anyone had been walking. Suddenly, I remember. It took him. I need my rifle. It’s not on the ground. There’s no rifles around. *Thud.* I look at my feet. A rifle. Before I even turn around I know what will be there. It’s not like it looked in books. It looked like a cover with a mouth to connect them all. There weren’t any eyes. It opened up, showing me its razor teeth. What I learned rang through my head: it attacks when it hears noise. I couldn’t help myself. It was a reaction.

&gt; Hell, you can even find a local musician who knows how to play and see if they'd be willing to help you out.   

This sounds like free lessons to me. since it's in the context of taking lessons or not. And the part about going to a teacher who is over it wouldn't even be relevant if you weren't talking about taking lessons.  
To end on a positive note (haha) you are correct that finding the right teacher is a good idea.  
I think OP should take a few lessons to learn fundamentals such as the position of the hands. After that, since I don't think he's trying to be a concert pianist, there are lots of things that can be learned on your own. I pretty much taught myself piano but this was after years of guitar, with some basic understandings of theory. It helps to get a songbook of music by someone who is a pretty basic player. I had a John Lennon songbook and the songs are great but he's not a great pianist. Perfect for beginners. Neil Young is also great for piano or guitar beginners. Lots of songs using mostly the white keys. :D",1470010288

I only told them because it was in the middle of a heart to heart in which I also told them for the first time that I don't share their christian faith. I did all this because I wanted to be able to tell them about the guy I was dating at the time, and he wasn't a Christian. He never quite understood the gravity of the situation and felt like I waited too long, but if you have traditional Asian parents you'd understand. 

My mom was surprisingly chill about it, and was just like ""as long as you only do it when you want to with someone you care about I can live with it."" Granted, my parents have mellowed out a LOT over the past year (maybe because I got into medical school..) and I also have just stopped giving as much of a shit about whether they judge me.
Of course, with our kind of parents you kinda have to ease them into the 21st century...so they don't know how many partners I've had (more than the number of boyfriends I've had), how most of them were casual sex and that I have a very laissez-faire attitude toward sex, and that I use birth control (an IUD).

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","The most stressful event of my life was my husband going through med school and early residency. You see, he was very depressed but his parents had drilled into him this stigma about seeking help. There were days I could barely get him off the couch. He was ridiculously stressed and we fought so much. I begged him to get help, but he was afraid he'd fuck over his chances to get into a good residency program. Finally, i forced his hand; i scheduled an appointment for him. So many times, my own depression was rising and i wanted to end things. His going gave me hope. He went on meds and started to get better. My own anxiety spiraled out of control. I cant tell you how many times I had a plan to kill myself. At the time, i blogged a lot and my brother in law saw a post about my anxiety and told my husband. Hubby then suggested i follow my own advice and go to the doctor so i went on meds. My life changed. I still struggled with anxiety but it was manageable. My physical health spiraled next (fucking autoimmune disorders) and again, hubby encouraged me to go to the doctor where i discovered i wasnt crazy. Today I'm ofd meds while i try to conceive, but I'm doing so much better and so is hubby. I don't contemplate suicide anymore and my husband is night and day different.

I Did about 7 free couples shoots, to get the practice with photographing couples. I used those images to land some second shooting positions. My website isn't anything incredible yet, I've still got a lot that I can add to it from the weddings that I've shot. I had not thought about reaching out to photograph recently engaged couples, however I will be seeking that out now. I have second shot 7 weddings so far, and recently signed a contract to work with a husband and wife couple that are due for twins. So I should be shooting a ton more in the fall.

"Maplestory","t5_2rrdo","Cube the things that will stick forever first, and then work your way backwards to thing you might not keep forever. Things like your emblem, badge, weapon, secondary, frozen equips, and the gollux rings will take high priority because they will stick around for a while or forever. You can cube the boss accessories last if you feel like you need the boost to damage.  

&amp;nbsp;


Mesos from daily bosses are definitely enough to get everything to 6% STR over time. Zakum should be approximately 2m per kill(4m a day), and then you sell the equips for a bit more. Hilla should give about 3.5m a kill(7m a day) and then you sell the Necro equips for a bit more. Ranmaru should also drop random use items for about 1m per kill. I believe HT is somewhere between 2-3m per kill on Normal. Sell all Reindeer Milk, Sunrsie Dew, Sunset Dew, and excess Power Elixirs/Elixirs. You can get around 20m a day from just bossing, and this will be your main method of income.  

&amp;nbsp;


I am not 100% sure on the best possible endgame combination, but it is 3 Fafnir pieces (we use Fafnir because it consists of Top + Bottom instead of an overall, so there is 1 more item to get potential on compared to just Sweetwater Suit). The rest is a tossup between Tyrant equips and Sweetwater. I'm sure someone has done the math somewhere.  

&amp;nbsp;


You can take all 5 professions. Smithing creates weapons, and creates the Ranmaru weapon, but at lv 10 smithing, crafting the weapon is a 90% success. You need Master Craftsman to have a 100% success rate, but I took the 90% chance anyways because the materials are relatively easy to gather. Do not overlook Mining! It is a very strong profession. If you've walked out to fields, you might have seen a large green crystal called a Mysterious Vein or the purple variant called Legendary Mysterious Vein. Mine these, and you might get Pieces of Time (500k each), Dream Frags, Confusion Frags, Primal Essence(fkin rare), Purple Powders, and Master Craftsman Cubes at a fairly common rate(I'd say 1 in 3-4?). If you dig up a cube, that's like digging up 7.5m.  

&amp;nbsp;

The Pocket Slot is indeed Lv 30 Charm. Zakum gives 4 Zakum Helmets a day for 60 Charm each. Use Alchemy to fuse 2 of the same thing together to create a new copy of the item. So with that, 4 Zakum helmets can become 2 more Zakum Helmets of 60 charm, and then becomes yet another Helmet. Nets 420(Insert swag/dank meme) Charm a day.  ",1470010307

Strategic retreat is also a ""mode"" IMHO, distinct from the other three.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; So why is it sexist to ignore a woman's health concern despite anything other than evidence for a lack of consideration for health and well being in general but if it's done to a man for a male health concern it's not sexist.

That looks like an assumption to me.  Can you give an example, or is this just a hypothetical 'what about the men?'  

&gt;It needs to be because they are X, Y happens. Not that hey happen to be X, and it's impossible for Y specifically to happen to Z.
Vaginal rape is not sexist because it can't happen to men. It's just rape. It's horrid. But it's not sexist.
For a rape to be sexist it would have to be something like ""sodomize all the women beat all the men"". There needs to be intent as a result of the persons sex not just sex as a circumstance.

From my experience, it comes down to figuring out what's most important to you. For me, I wanted a slower, humble lifestyle where I would have more time to think and study. This was at odds with being a teacher in NYC. For you, it seems like money, materialism, or financial/career ""success"" (means different things to different people) might be what you want most.

I know its pretty tough to compare when you have only been watching the NBA for a few years, and you think Curry is already one of the best 5 point guards to ever play the game. Maybe once you get a few more seasons under your belt you will be able to look at the game a little more objectively.

Chris Paul is one of the best passers in the HISTORY of the NBA, and every single stat backs that up. But keep telling yourself that a guy who has averaged above 7 assists only once in his career is on that level. ",1470010311

I would cut off the left part since it ruins the idea of the character coming out of the folder. If you REALLY want the whole character, you could put him in front of the folder, *I guess*, or you can rotate the render.   
The right side of the logo render cuts off a bit, so you probably want to move it left or make it smaller so that doesn't stand out.  
Finally, though it's not a big deal, you could try to match the background color with some of the other colors, or make it a little darker so it stands out more.

Can't be used to ""end of turn, kill your guy"" unless it would already die to shock. Really punishes creatures with 3 health, and provides a minor upside vs. creatures that require multiple burn spells to kill (3 + second burn spell at EoT = net +2 damage, as if you burned the face). The downside is that it can't hit the face directly, but often will in the current format.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","VMs do not let you increase processing power. Only more hardware could do that.

VMs actually would take away processing power because you're putting multiple logical computers on the same physical hardware. Basically, think of the system requirements for the OS. Then multiply that by the number of VMs you are running, plus some for the host OS (which is usually quite minimal if your running a bare-metal install of something like VMware). Then whatever is left can be divided up among those VMs.


They lower costs because you only need one physical server and physical servers can get really fucking expensive really fucking fast. They also have a base cost, so if you just need to run low power servers, such as file and print servers and need them to be separate servers for some reason (we did in Afghanistan, which was both irritating and wonderful for different reasons), then you don't need separate physical servers.

Other ways they lower costs is by having increased up time. You can just clone the server and move it to a different node, then shut down the physical server for maintenance or replacement or whatever else. Or if your server goes down, you can quickly plop a back up on a different machine and be back and running in no time, instead of having to completely rebuild that bitch.

To summarize, VMs don't increase processing power; they lower costs.",1470010313

&gt; ANKARA/ISTANBULTurkey dismissed nearly 1,400 more members of its armed forces and stacked the top military council with government ministers on Sunday, moves designed by President Tayyip Erdogan to put him in full control of the military after a failed coup.

&gt; The new wave of army expulsions and the overhaul of the Supreme Military Council were announced in the official state gazette just hours after Erdogan said late on Saturday he planned to shut down existing military academies and put the armed forces under the command of the Defence Ministry.

&gt; The aggressive military purges come at a time when the armed forces is stretched by fighting with Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey and threats from Islamic State militants on its border with Syria.

Lol yeah, what you call ""having a change of heart"" the rest of us call ""saying whatever she has to to win votes"".  Forgive me for wondering why she was so adamantly against gay marriage for decades or was all gung-ho about building a wall and deporting illegal immigrants, and now *all of the sudden* she happens to have a change of heart when it's politically expedient to do so.  You're right - other politicians do it, and it's fucked up when they do it too.

&gt;Above the law? Which instances? She was found not to be criminally negligent in all the 'cases' brought against her. The e-mail scandal being the most recent.  Not IT savvy, yup. Criminally above the law... insufficient evidence. 

Except when Comey straight up said, ""If this was anyone else, we'd prosecute, but since it's Hillary Clinton we're not gonna do anything.""  That's criminally above the law *by definition*.  And that's not even counting the proceedings afterwards when he flat out admitted that she broke the law - letting someone without a security clearance view classified information?  The rest of us plebs would be looking at a 5-10 year prison sentence *minimum*.

&gt;Money laundering charity: Again, cite specific examples. The charity has worked within the bounds of the law. That the laws suck are not actually her fault. 

I'll give you this one.

&gt;Rigging the primaries: The DNC rigged the primaries on her behalf. There's no evidence she specifically requested that they do so. You would be amazed what people will do when they believe in a cause. 

Hahahahahaha.  Come on dude, are you *that* naive?  Yeah, I'm sure Hillary had *nothing* to do with it, which is why she just *happened* to hire DWS on to her campaign staff after she was forced to step down.  Gimme a break.

&gt;Playing the woman card: Sure everyone plays their cards in politics. Obama played the black card, Trump plays the 'billionaire' card, Cruz played the evangelical card.

Songs' income depend on the strength of the music, to some extent virality can come from a good video, but most people will be consuming the media in audio only, so it doesn't make sense to spend vast amounts of money and time on making something artistically profound.

Like, the video is pretty cool, the choreography is interesting, the wardrobe is minimalist but the robot hand is an interesting touch, and the camera shots break the mould of traditional music videos, allowing the dancers to go to the edges and out of the shots instead of panning towards them all the time.

That, and, the monochrome and the high contrast, and big differences in lighting are pretty interesting.

I mean, I'm not going to tell you that it's artistically profound, but demonstrably it spread memetically very far and went very viral, and even as someone who wasn't particularly interested in the song and only saw the video one or two times, it still stuck out in my head 7 years later.

"Enough_Sanders_Spam","t5_3fmhe","I read part of that document. The exit poll guy claims they're always proof of rigging, and then brings up that Nate Cohen on Twitter says it's not. His entire part of the document is literally rebutting tweets of Nate Cohen. 

One such rebuttal is that if youth votes skew exit polls, then the percentage of youth in every states poll should reflect how much of the vote Sanders got. 

His evidence is that Mississippi and Vermont each at 15% youth, but Sanders got 80% in Vermont and 30% in Mississippi. 

He literally cannot figure out why youth in each state would be different, nor that Sanders' home state would be different. 

There's also where he looks up % white people in the areas polled, and tries to compare a southern state to a northern state as proof of rigging. Literally unable to tell that northern white Democrats and southern white Democrats aren't both socialist loving hippies. 

He doesn't understand the difference between a mandatory exit poll and a media conducted one, nor that even EVEP polls aren't accurate with any amount of early or mail voting.

He literally has 0 qualifications, and is basically a nut living in Vermont who sues the state because he fought a speeding ticket and lost.

I'm willing to bet if you looked into the actual only 2 people who know law (2 of them are lawyers) they're probably property law people or something stupid.

Since you have all the points, now you have the time to study the websites, compare the points vs airfare cost and/or hotel cost, and figure out where there's price arbitrage for places you want to go (or places that are off your radar but sound interesting!  Like Norway - never been on my radar but I hear good things about it from people who have visited, so i'd be willing to go if I saw a ridic good price...), and even though you need to mostly eat out when you travel, it could still be good $ savings - museums, hiking, exploring new cities are cheap ways to spend the day - much more cost effective than getting bored when you're home so you end up hopping over to the local masseuse for a few hours...  Learning about wine &amp; cheese, collecting the best, and having a bunch of friends over to share it with is also fun and cost effective.  My husband collects wine, and we've gotten to be good friends with several wine makers - going to their wineries and buying a case here or there at wholesale cost (not cheap bottles, but $40-70 instead of $150-200 retail, $200-400 in restaurants), and putting out a nice food spread for friends is still much cheaper than going out.  And for date ""night"", now you can hit all the lunch specials, too - like Jean Georges is $100+ (just food) for dinner but $29 for 3 courses at lunch... Take your wife to something that, get a nice bottle of wine (you'll prob drink less at lunch, too, saving you over $200) and you can go home, be romantic, then hang out by the pool with the kids when they get home from school - great date day and you just saved ≈ $200, too!  It's fun thinking up ways to save (while not starving yourself of the good things in life).  Ooooh - farmers markets!

Aside from a text of him claiming this, the only way to actually do something like this at a layman level is installing viruses/rootkits/keyloggers on your home computers.

Just go through the steps to virus scan your computer and see if anything pops up (very very unlikely, if something DOES pop up **DO NOT DELETE IT**)

If you find something, contact police and inform them you believe a family member has illegally installed a virus on your computer in your home to spy on your family. THIS IS ILLEGAL.

Police will be able to inspect the virus and chances are easily find out where it sends the data too, and if this guy is stupid enough to admit he is doing it over text, he probably was stupid enough to make the virus lead police right to him.

The combination of the text message proof, the virus on your computer existing, potentially incriminating him directly, and being interrogated by police will be enough to put him in jail.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Something I would recommend for you to try is a gentle cleanser (your preference) and then follow up with this miracle toner called ""Lotion p50."" It is a bit more expensive, but you can buy a sample size from Vicki Morav (free shipping too). I would recommend the 'new formula' since it is more stable and has better ingredients. It contains a slew of really beneficial ingredients, but it mainly a chemical exfoliator. There are three strengths: lotion p50 - the strongest, lotion p50v, and lotion p50w (the weakest). I would recommend for you to get the lotion p50w and then see if you need a stronger one. 

It really has helped not only with my stubborn acne, it also made my skin more oily and my pores look smaller. BEWARE - it contains vinegar (a much more gentle main ingredient than alcohol to which hazel) which gives the toner/lotion a very unique and distinct smell. I don't find it very bothersome, but some might would. As I said, the ingredient list is superb, so there is no fragrance. The smell dissipates almost immediately after it goes on your face. 

Follow up with either a prescription strength retinoid and good moisturizer. Remember not to mix retinol with AHAs, BHAs, (ones is a serum or moisturizer left on your face, not like p50), benzoyl peroxide. And the gold rule of skincare: ALWAYS WEAR SUNSCREEN. The sun is the number one contributor not only to wrinkles and the aging of skin, but also much darker and stubborn scars. (I would recommend a sheer weightless one like either the Drunk Elephant one or the Kiehls facial fuel one. Both just disappear on your face and are broad spectrum.

Again, lotion p50w is my holy grail product. However, all skin is different. I would also go to a derm (if you haven't already) and talk to them about it too.

Best of luck too you, and hope everything clears up!",1470010325

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Unfortunately unlike in France there is not a presumed public secularism that is enforced down the line, government, in public etc, like you have with bans on schoolchildren wearing religious objects.

From the beginning America at best had an uneasy truce between the secularists and multiple factions of competing religions (mainly different christian denominations), with the understanding the government wouldn't *favor* one group, that unfortunately doesn't translate to their absence. 
And it has become in the last... oh half century (some might argue century even) in favor for the religious to seek to exert some influence over politics, much of that has been detrimental and highly regressive (the republicans and their history of using religion to justify racism and now discrimination towards gays). But some has been positive, african americans (blacks) successfully used religion as a vehicle for their social change in the civil rights movement (admittedly it was the only one they had, they weren't allowed to gather much anywhere outside of church) and the democrats have (mostly) taken up that kind of religious influence, that of the preachers who use religion as their argument for why we must change for the better, preachers who argue for abortion rights, civil rights, for helping the poor, etc. They are a different breed entirely from the republican religious. While I would rather we not have any religion in the public sphere, this very liberal, very progress oriented version that continually re-evaluates the bible and mines it for things that support a modern agenda is far better than what the other side has and I think a good enough bridge towards a fully secular future.

As to how do I live in this period? I live step by step, taking whatever I can get on the road towards a secular society, in this case the democrats are the way forward and I vote for them, but I'm always looking for whatever advances the cause best and am open to change. Unfortunately in America we have an entrenched two party system as you note and realistically it is likely that the democrats are going to be our only option for some time.
It is very much a waiting game, the democrats are in no particular rush as they can take our votes for granted, so we have only baby steps mostly. However in America social change tends to happen in spurts, by leaps and bounds, it strolls along slowly for some time before suddenly leaping forward suddenly followed by a period of great resistance and backward pressure by those left behind who hold the old views.

It is the grand journey and I have no illusions that in this country (much of it being rural) it will take some time.",1470010325
