While at 54 still a work in process, I am a vegetarian (see corporate tainted food ect.) I shop at farmers markets, small shops and co-ops (member owned) I live in a urban space for two of 900 sq ft. I ride a bike and take MTA. I bank at a Federal Credit Union (small, local, member owned. Most importantly, I choose to live simply.
As example . . . Go to a corporate drug store (the checkout girl has no health or retirement  and has to stock shelves and sweep floors for minimum wage or less if the corporation could, and is concerned abouting chatting about the community becouse of the boss.) or ride a mile to an owner run drug store (she welcome me by name, asks about my family and work or the community. She provides health and retirement for her workers.)
Every day and every doller I spend I make a chooise and incurage others to do the same. Do you still bank at B of A or Chase? Why? Eat at Mc Ds or BK ? Why?

Even your statement of saying we're too individualistic comes back to this point, our individualism is a result of these shared truths, and our individualism itself results in the varying degrees of values we place on the universal truths, or in rare cases the outright rejection of said truths/values.","1262304168"

We have to care about the other; the other person, the other culture or race, the other species, the other environments we don't live in.  Our capacity for empathy is what makes humanity so different from the majority of the animal kingdom.  It can unite us in social structures of mutual compassion.  This is easy to see at the local level, in tribes, churches, and in our communities.  We have to expand our application of empathy to the entire planet.  Its the only way we will be compelled to take responsibility for what is done to the other, and in doing so take responsibility for our collective selves.

We are at a crossroads in human development.  I only see two basic structures that could unite the world in a long lasting civilization.  Either we take responsibility for ourselves by caring for the other, or a tyrannical hierarchy of control will take that responsibility by preventing us from hurting the other.  Short of either one, our current form of civilization will expire once the resources become too scarce for our infinite growth.","1262304197"

So we're supposed to fight like hell, against our own financial self-interest, to change some social mores, but accept others as insurmountable obstacles that we must work around?

Silly. 

Why doesn't PZ Meyers criticize little girls for buying pink microscopes, instead of toymakers for not releasing the most powerful model in pink (the less powerful ones are available in black, so that's what we're really talking about here)?

I'll tell you why. Because PZ Meyers is as much a victim of conditioned, biased, unscientific thinking as the people he often rails against. The fact that he is most often right is an accident. He may be indoctrinated to a more accurate worldview, but he's still indoctrinated. 

Corporate entities are automatically the enemy. Little girls are automatically blameless victims. Parents of little girls are automatically well-meaning, but misguided. 

Scientists are generally only scientific about their specialty. Outside that, they rarely if ever apply their disciplines of thought to the conclusions they form. 

PZ Meyers has no idea how many microscopes are bought by/for little girls, of what power, in what colour, and how this compares to the numbers for little boys. And not knowing the *what*, he *certainly* has no idea of the why. 

And yet, he has formed a clear opinion that something is wrong, that he knows what it is, and that he knows who is to blame. 

He would not *dream* of leaping to conclusions in this fashion in biology, a field where he is a qualified expert. But he does so in psychology and sociology, fields where he is not.

She wasn't bad looking, but definitely not as hot as the one I was trying to hook up with.  The only problem was since this girl kept flirting with me (while I was kind of trying to ignore her) the hot chick started backing off.  It turns out it was her sister who was visiting from high school (and she was 17...oops).  So the hot sister, seeing her little not as pretty sister wanted me, basically stop flirting with me.  By then I was pretty drunk and kind of pissed, and I decided that I'm getting my dick wet one way or the other.  So I let the sister blow me (she was really good, incidentally, and swallowed) and I bounced.

I still see the hot sister around school sometimes, and one time we started flirting again, but she said ""I like you, but if you think you're getting with both of the (her last name) sisters, don't get your hopes up.""  So that was that.

Hijacking an upper comment here-- 

&gt; I'd like to say the education system is to blame, but the reality of it is that people in the US have never really valued education.
We did. A long time ago. Back when it was relevant.

&gt; We deride people who are academically-inclined or educated, we praise the ""self-made man"" who made something of himself without the need for formal training, we call them nerds, book-worms.
My belief is that the anti-intellectualism stems from people not being entertained by what intellectuals think is ""cool"" -- like programming. They associate intellectuals with Shakespeare and Monet and wine tastings.

I believe that part of the reason the self-made man is respected is because they have skills that are relevant -now- and can make a difference... -now-.

To understand how we got to this point, I need to give a small history lesson. Back in the 1800s, when the American education system was first sprouting up, the most PRESTIGIOUS career you could possibly have is a priest. That's why you went to school. No other reason why anyone would go to school. That's why you went to college. Actually, that's why most old-old colleges have a religious affiliation. Now, back then the only thing that was important to analyze was the Bible. 

And that was fine. If you wanted to become a priest. Then capitalism came in. Started saying, ""Hey, school/college is for everyone. So we're not just having you study the Bible, we're having you study Shakespeare too."" and that was fine. For the 1700s. When there were no cars and no railroads, and generally no reason to learn problem solving, engineering, marketing, sales, or writing.

While I love Shakespeare's writing and Claude Monet's painting, we should absolutely not be forcing that crap on our kids, masquerading it as ""teaching analytical skills"". What's more important? Learning to analyze Shakespeare, or learning to analyze modern social problems. Yes, I know, Shakespeare has some applications to modern social problems, no, I don't care. We've tried doing this shit the Shakespeare way since the 1700s. What's it done to the spirit and motivation of our students? It's crushed it. DOE performance audits (both internal and public) rate student motivation as it's lowest... ever.

My boss' original question is-- well, why is that? Here's the answer, and I'm right about this: it's because the stuff our students are learning is no longer relevant to their daily lives. At all.

Here's something I learned the other day that simply blew me away-- one of my favorite Counter-Strike maps was, in fact, built by a fourteen year old. This kid apparently taught himself how to use it using online tutorials, and then practiced and practiced until something good came out. 

Now, if you can get a fourteen year-old kid to teach himself how to create a complicated map, while studying how gameplay flows inbetween the different areas, and successfully marketing it to a community, why isn't that kid being taught to do that in school? The CS thing is a perfect example, because it teaches marketing, analytics, critical thinking skills... all REALLY important. Yes, Shakespeare teaches critical thinking skills. I know. I don't care. Shakespeare is boring to *most* 14 year-old kids. CS is not.


&gt; No, we don't value education, we don't value culture, we rejected everything the ""old world"" taught us 
Yep. But screw the old world.

&gt; threw the baby out with the bath-water, so now all we have left is an obscene culture of self-indulgence, self-gratification and self-obsession.

Most of us would.  The problem is, the public now associates him with infidelity, divorce, and domestic violence.  So how is AT&amp;T (or any company) supposed to put an ad on television with Tiger endorsing their product, knowing that the public isn't going to see the World's Greatest Golfer liking the product, but is going to see The Guy Who Cheated on His Wife a Gazillion Times and She Found Out and is Divorcing Him After Beating Him Up.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I disagree.  This sort of scenario usually suggests a difference between what you want and what you need which is common for people with out much dating experience.  If you haven't dated for ten years you're probably deeply out of touch with what actually makes you happy in a relationship.  There are a lot of things that seem like they would make you happy... hotness, intelligence, liking the same bands etc... but these aren't the things that really make a relationship work.  I've dated some people rather reluctantly, which resulted in a change in the way I saw the person and some of my most satisfying relationships.

I want to qualify this and say that you should always treat people with respect and a reasonable amount of transparency.  For instance, if it's clear after a date or two that you don't see the other person as a long term potential, you have to make this clear to them.  Don't deceive them or give them inappropriate expectations.  If you tell people you're experimenting around to see what works for you, they'll be understanding.","1262304436"

Since starting the current system at 1 AD is completely arbitrary, you can treat 1 BC the same as 0 AD if you want to have perfect groupings going back, but it doesn't mean anything. It makes much more sense to refer to the 90's as a decade from 1990 through 1999 than to have to explain ""well technically, if we start counting at year 1..."" It's just grouping so we can refer to sets of years more easily, and grouping how one would count (2000 being the start of a new millennium, 2010 the start of a new decade), regardless of whether we start at ""0 AD"" or ""1 AD,"" since it's still a year that existed, is what makes sense.","1262304458"

You are saying that if the Apostle Paul included any historical details of the life of Christ in his epistles you would consider those entries fraudulent?

Yes. But, again, where and when did the Passion tradition originate. Paul gives us no idea.

&gt;He did. 1 Corinthians 15:1-8 is a testimony of who saw Jesus resurrected.

Yes, he did report that people saw the risen Christ but nothing else. And, note that he does not say that anyone saw the risen Christ three days after he was crucified. In Paul's universe, Christ could have been slain from the foundation of the world. He gives no historical details of the life and death of a Galilean named ""Jesus"".

Well, obviously, since the data has not been there for the last 1900 years for it to appear now would be emendation. But what kind of argument is that? It sounds like you're saying: ""It's not there because God didn't put it there.""

You could use the same demonstration to show that you *should* be doing 10km/h under the speed limit.. just move the truck a little closer and you can finger waggle at the people doing the speed limit and having an accident. 

It's not that excessive speed is safe, just that their implication that the official speed limit is a safe speed is not justified by this video, it's too condition dependent. For example if you have a road on a 15 degree slope typically the speed limit will be the same in both directions but a car traveling at 90 up the hill has a shorter stopping distance than a car traveling down the hill at 60.

No sequences there!

Lazy evaluation can be simply, as your link describes, when an ""expression is only evaluated if the result is required by the calling function"". In my example, the functions created by startsWith and endsWith are not evaluated until later (i.e., when required) as indicated by invoking select, hence it is lazily evaluated.","1262304617"

Historically I've not been a dating man, more looking for relationships, and I've always found those via communities I was involved with (clubs in school, online gaming, etc), but my friends who do more dating say to pretty much treat things like OKCupid like a bar.  Have fun, be open minded, be relaxed, have a good date and you'll be fine.  Just like a bar, everyone puts their best foot forward on these sites, and so should you.  Just like a bar, sometimes you'll approach someone (online) and they'll turn you down.  But at least the size of the pool is a bit larger and you know more about them, so you'll have more initial success.  Like you, I dig OKCupids look/feel/philosophy more than others, but the quality of people is not necessarily better.

Manage your expectations and have some fun, and they're a fine place to meet new people.  99% of all people are average, and that's true on these sites too :)","1262304677"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;I showed you historical evidence. Written pornography was primarily consumed by men for a very long time.

That doesn't prove correlation. 

&gt;If visual pornography was really THAT hardwired, we would expect to see etchings of erotic acts being as popular as written erotic works in the 18th and 19th centuries. They weren't.

etchings arn't exactly as effective as the real thing. That's like suggesting that a stick figure of two people having sex is more powerful than an erotic novel. Men are visual by nature, but that doesn't mean that everything they see that suggests sex gets the off. At the time, written erotica was the closest thing they could get. 


Again, provide scientific evidence.. meaning from a credible source, or your claim is pretty empty. One could easily just as well say that it is a fact that it works to drill holes in people's heads to fix head aches because that's what people did in the medieval times, but we have adapted to other medicine because thats what we use now.

Please paraphrase the argument. Simply throwing links is not conducive to the discussion. 

&gt;The presupposition that the efficacy of magic/religion/mysticism is more reliable than demonstrably provable results is either intellectually lazy or dishonest.

That wasn't my argument. I asked what if I value Religious experience more than Science? 

&gt;Not because of the religious aspect, but because you fancy magical thinking, belief and personal ""facts"" over logical/rational/pragmatic thinking and knowledge.

Why is the latter better than the former, objectively speaking.

&gt;Irrelevant

No its very relevant. 

&gt;Science can and does produce these reliable, reproducible results. Religion cannot.

So what? Religion doesn't aim to do that in the first place. You're comparing apples and oranges. 

&gt;You'd have to be intellectually dishonest as hell to both use modern technology and distrust science's ability to produce largely reliable results.

That still isn't a rational reason for why I should value Science over Religion.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; a.k.a. ""The ill-thought out counting system that jumped directly from 1BC to 1AD with no year Zero in between"".

Agreed in full -- it was ill-thought out, and almost assuredly due to the fact they didn't have a 0 symbol in their numeral system.

&gt; And for some reason (or more likely, due to a lack of reasoning skills) some people are hell-bent on making the year counting and naming system incredibly awkward for humans and computers alike,

This has no bearing on computers. The only thing that matters is if a decade (and by implication, century and millennium) starts on a year that ends with a 0 or ends with a 1. The general public usually *prefers* a 1, it's actually usually harder to convince people that counting should usually start at 0. If you look at a simple number table of 100 numbers, it usually is in rows of 10 starting at 1 and ending at 100. 

This makes absolutely nothing harder for people, let alone computers. It's simply an issue of proper vocabulary.

I've done years of C.S. and Math work, in and out of school. I like it when systems start counting from 0, and it irks me when they don't. But the simple fact is that we didn't do the right way originally, and changing our casual vocabulary to fit a slightly prettier system doesn't make sense to me. It takes almost no extra thought to figure out, just get it right when you speak.","1262304781"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt; And please explain the animosity toward anarcho-capitalism, any elaboration would be greatly appreciated.

There really shouldn't be any animosity. I suspect most of the conflict arises from people on both sides not knowing exactly the position of the other side. The common anarcho-""capitalist"" position just defends the right of people to own the product of their labor plus the natural resources used in the process.
The ""hierarchies"" only begin to exist in the extreme sense (see [here](http://polycentricorder.blogspot.com/2009/10/two-sided-dillema.html)) but this is true for the ""social""-anarchists as well.
The conflict is largely semantical although few will admit it. ""Capitalism"" in the anarcho sense has more to do with respect for the product of labor than it is given credit (see [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLFQ1okRZzM))","1262304811"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","No it's not terminal. The issue is that she has arthritis throughout her body. Unfortunately it appears to bug her the most on the pad of her foot and as such she's licked it for the past year to help ""scratch"" the itch. As you know cat's tongues are like sandpaper, so she's essentially killed the tissue on her pad by licking it so much and has made a bloody mess of it. 

As of a couple months ago I noticed she started to get a bit more agitated with it as she would actually gnaw at it trying to relieve the ""itch"" from the arthritis. When I looked closer it almost looked like she had punctured through to the bone. We had the vet take a look at it, but all he could do was give her some steroids to help with the itching but of course this is something he had to inject and it would only last a few days. So for months on end I would sterilize the wound, apply polysporin and wrap in gauze. After I wrapped it up, I even had to use hockey tape and tape it tightly to her foot otherwise she would tear off the bandage. I went about for a month or so changing the bandage every night, but at her age she doesn't appear to heal fast, if heal at all, so there was really no change. At this point we had the vet stitch it close, and since then she's been living with a cone on her head and limping around. I think she's doing better then she was months ago as it's obviously not bugging her as much, but she still try's to get at it which is why the cone is still on her head.

We all know she's nearing the end, and it will be the worst day of my life when we finally decide to put her down. It's not so much that the abcess is killing her, it's just causing her discomfort and pain, and I'd rather not have her live in that much pain.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A hypothetical universe has many qualities; there are universes where I am white, and where I am black, where I am tall, and where I am short, I can imagine all of these things, just as I can imagine universes where god is tall or god is short, where god looks like a human, or looks like an elephant. A description of god and demonstrating the existence of a specific god is very different than demonstrating the existence of a god.

Not only can I tell you firmly that god exists, because humans exist, and humans define the nature of the words they used, and we, or I more specifically have allowed the definition of god to include the abstract that which we cannot know but is more powerful than I and has some role in my creation, but also, I can show you that mathematically it is probabalistically much more likely for there to be some form of god than no god what-so-ever.

If you misunderstood my argument than fine, but I am not arguing that any one of your infinity of improbable things is true, all I am arguing is that taken as a whole, the likelihood of all of those improbable things, is greater than that of one other similarly improbable thing (no god). You give false value to your one improbable possible universe; all else being equal, and knowing nothing factual about the question of the existence of god, you give yourself a 50% chance of being true; a very narrow minded thing to do. I am merely pointing out an error in your domain — the question is not god or no god, the question is what is the nature, and the range of answers to this are infinite.

You bring Occam's Razor into it which is fitting, as I am merely applying that. When all our understanding of the universe suggests there is an X which we do not yet comprehend, why is nulling it to zero in line with the principle of Occam's Razor? it isnt.

I am not arguing for a specific hypothesis, or a specific theory; I am not an engineer and I will not profess a specificity until I have some inkling about what those specifics might be.

I don't need a theory or hypothesis about the nature of god to demonstrate that it is more likely that a god of some form exists. I am not inventing a god to explain things I don't understand, I am simply calling that which I don't understand god.

I have in fact presented quite a solid challenge to everything you have said.

So they took the guy in for questioning on suspicion that there could be a bomb, and then did a manual search of the bag. And maybe at that point they didn't actually find a bomb in the bag, but they did find something else illegal in there or maybe the guy revealed a crime during questioning.

Or maybe the guy was in cahoots with the bomber and there was some bomb residue on his bag, but not enough evidence to really come out and say that they were accomplices. That would explain him being ""in custody"" but not yet ""under arrest"".

&gt;Notice that this man was ""being held"" and not ""arrested"", which was a cute semantic ploy by the FBI to stretch the truth and not lie. 

It's not a ""cute semantic ploy"" because the two statuses are very different things, with different investigation options constitutionally available to law enforcement, different standards that law enforcement has to meet in order to legally keep the guy, and different options the suspect has of challenging it.

Secondly, if you make an assertive statement, they'll probably react by finding a counterargument, and it turns out that *that* is also counterproductive for you, because the more someone searches for arguments against you, the more convinced of their position they become, even if your points are stronger than theirs.

So, I recommend the one thing you say be an innocent question, rather than an assertive claim.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","...Short story:

Sometime in 1969/1970, my grandparents purchased an H.H. Scott console.

In the following decades, they proceeded to use it happily at 5-10% volume, a few days out of every week-- until, finally, they gave it to their church.  The church just let it sit there for years.  The easiest thing to say is probably that I didn't even know that thing existed.

One day I guess I off-handedly mentioned to my Grandparents that I really wanted a record player...

When I walked into my bedroom that next fateful day, and saw what my simple request had bestowed upon me, I knew that I would never want another primary sound setup for the entire rest of my life.

[The turntable I have](http://i.audioscope.net/sonyx55.jpg) was already in the ['69 Scott Berkeley from my grandparents](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2428/3728759630_576c106db3_o.jpg).  

The Berkeley, when I got it, was in perfect condition *but I've used it quite a lot since then*.  It's been in at least six different houses since I first got my hands on it, and I still have the original user's Manual in one full piece.  It's been through a lot since it met me, but I mean, I have plans to restore every aspect of that console when I can afford it in the future (I'm really not ever going to get rid of it.  Seriously.)  

So, I guess it's mostly for sentimental reasons, but I just can't imagine using a different turntable, because that PS-x55 has been doing a fine job for my family since the year it came out--  just like the stereo console that I got it in.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Let's review:

* I provided many examples of the stupid things belief in a deity which has never been proven real will lead people to do and you have not refuted a single one. 

* You claim it is stupid for me to state I am atheist because you choose to think that just because you can't read my mind that there's a chance I am not.  Not only is your claim based on ridiculous conjecture, it has nothing to do with the fact that no ""god"" described by humans has **EVER** been proven to be real.  I am **atheist**.  I am 100% certain no ""god"" described by humans exists.  While there's a slim chance there may be a being humans would call a ""god,"" the fact that such a thing has never been shown to exist gives me no cause to define myself as anything BUT atheist.  Besides, when people want to know if someone is atheist, they don't ask, ""Do you believe in a god which has never been described by humans but might exist?""

You'll take it on FAITH (a concept hijacked by religious adherents and put to use for muddling the minds of the easily led) that a ""god"" exists without being shown one bit of convincing evidence, but you'll claim a real person (me) with real thoughts &amp; a history of expression just *can't* be atheist without you being hooked directly to my brain in order to make sure.

You are wasting my time with fucking nonsense.

You go ahead and capitalize the word ""god.""  However, unless one is proven to be real, I will choose not to do so.  I will also encourage those with the ability to think more rationally than you to do the same as I.

P.S. Can you prove you did not murder three male teenagers then sodomize their corpses this year?  I'm sure you can claim you're innocent of any such deed, but if you cannot prove it I must assume you are guilty and call you stupid for trying to profess non-guilt with mere words.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","There's something about having an outside perspective that seems to be one of the most helpful aspects of working with a therapist. That's what I would recommend, in any case. 

Your worries about the expense, and the comfort level, are common (and understandable!) concerns. If you have insurance, therapy may be covered in full or in part. If you don't have insurance, you can google the city you are in and ""free or low cost mental health"" to see if you can find free or sliding-scale services in your area. If you are in college, your university probably has a counseling center where services are usually free.

No one is comfortable the first time they go see a therapist. It's *weird* going to talk to someone you don't know about your problems. 

But, therapists are trained in ways that should make it more comfortable to you. And, although you shouldn't expect to feel comfortable right away, if you go for the first meeting or so and don't feel like you could envision yourself *ever* becoming comfortable with that person, then you don't have to go back to them. 

In fact, you could even tell them (or, often, even email them if telling them seems too confrontational for you), that you feel like you and that person are not the best match. You could even ask them to refer you to someone else who is more of what you are looking for (e.g., has more experience with your specific issue(s), is your same gender/ethnicity, is the therapeutic orientation you are looking for). They won't take it personally - no one can be the ""right"" therapist for everyone. ","1262305033"

Obviously trolls are going to produce high volatility, but let's also consider high covariance with being new users and with helpful posters (probably highly attractive troll-targets). Now you see that you can get some meaningful betas out of constructing your own variables and regressing the market on them.

This also indicates that around 45% of your portfolio is subjected to more idiosyncratic risk than you thought (5% trolls plus 20% + 20% helpful posters with high covariance).

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I just finished reading ""The Moral Animal"" by Robert Wright. Near the end, after all but giving up on the idea of morality, he launches into an argument for utilitarianism. His premise is that humans have evolved mental organs for selfish reciprocal-altruism as well as mental organs for seeking social status through the appearance of doing good, and that these organs can be hijacked to support a happiness maximizing morality. 

It's a good book, both for those interested in Darwinism in general and those interested in reading about a theory which purports to explain the basis of human nature.

Edit- To answer the question of why should you accept this moral structure in the first place, Wright answers that in some ways evolution has left us little choice. Though the above mentioned mental faculties evolved from a purely selfish (from the gene's perspective) motivation, it has given us the tools and motivation necessary to act in ways that are beneficial to our kin, our friends, and our countries. Extending this into a moral code is just an attempt to stretch these faculties to cover more people, ideally all of humanity. Why should we extend these natural proclivities for doing good to others? Because we can profit from it ourselves. Small actions on our part (like not killing our neighbors) can lead to rewards that help us (like being invited to their New Year's eve party). It seems that a perverted version of the golden rule is baked right into our DNA, so why not maximize its benefits?","1262305075"

You say we will view it as being minor in hindsight.  You also choose the convenient pain and suffering of childbirth which is temporary and yields potentially a lifetime of joy, if you can even call childbirth pain and suffering to begin with.  What about the unnecessary pain and suffering of a half decade of cancer followed by death?  What about the pain and suffering of living in a war-zone or amidst a genocide.  Why AIDS, ever, for any reason?  Comparing childbirth to actual pain and suffering is naïve and completely insulting to those who actually suffer.  Give your ""can't have some of the clothes they think are cool"" speech to a starving child and see how much comfort it provides.  SOME of the cool clothes!? SOME!? How about no cool clothes.  How about no food or clothes at all?  I know you were just making a metaphor, but the terms you used highlight an insultingly sheltered concept of pain and suffering and sacrifice.  The sermon you just provided was about as philosophically empty and ignorant to the realities of life as anything I've ever heard come out of a white pastor's mouth back when I lived in Missouri.  Sorry if I sound harsh, but I find your apologetics and examples to be insulting to the concepts of pain and suffering.  Childbirth is a joy.  Clothes are a privilege.  Being upset about not having cool clothes is reprehensible behavior, not suffering, and should not have even been used in metaphor.  Despite how well what you said may have sounded within the range of suffering you have experienced in your life, and the conclusion that it gives you perspective; I doubt a starved infant corpse in Africa will have appreciated that it gained perspective.  The fact that you bothered to write anything you wrote above hints that you actually have limited perspective.


Everything you said also hinges on the concept that your memories and personality will somehow outlast your material brain, which should be patently absurd to any modern adult; and if you don't see why, then there is no point in discussing this further with you.  Which I don't plan on doing anyway, since what you said only makes sense if pain is temporary and minor, a magical place exists where you will be happy after you die.


I apologize if you are in fact a starving child in africa who has AIDS and is possibly missing limbs to the sting of a machete blade.  In which case I thank you for writing your comment in such a way as to appeal to this middle class audience which has no concept of what you go through as they read this on their computers with their full bellies in their comfortable homes with their cool clothes.  For your sake, I hope that the bronze age concept of a sky wizard in the clouds is more than just a wish for a light at the end of the tunnel.  Regardless, I'm sure the context you used will make them feel warm and fuzzy.","1262305098"

Yes, the police officer was great. What was kind of funny was he asked what we were doing and where we were going, I told him about the dog and he shined the light over the her and saw her really puffed out face and immediately asked if she was going to be ok. He then asked for my DL and registration and I didn't lie and gave him my DL but told him we didn't have registration. Thats when he said that was what he noticed and why he pulled us over. He was a really good guy and I wish there was some way I could thank him.

Our dog is doing ok now, her face is normal and she's not in any pain from the tooth, so thats a huge plus. :)

I 'may' actually have a line on helping design and get cabinets for some of my neighbours friends, but that won't be until after tax time. So it doesn't help me now.

Explain how it's a moral question.

&gt;Please paraphrase the argument. Simply throwing links is not conducive to the discussion.

The onus is on you to prove your point.   So far you've made no attempt beyond stating your position.    I'm offering you a link to substantiate mine.   You can take it or leave it, I don't care.   Hell, you can simply Google subjective rationalism and get tons of articles if you don't like that one.   I'm not going to type a thesis out for an online discussion I'm growing weary of in the first place.

&gt;That wasn't my argument. I askes what if I value Religious experience more than Science.

And that's exactly what I replied to.   If you value religious ""experience"" more than demonstrable evidence, then your logic is questionable imo, and furthermore you make your argument for objective-only rational look even more laughable. 

  Furthermore, define religious experience and prove that it's a real phenomena.     If you're going to play amateur deconstructionist, then let's look at some of your assumptions.


&gt;No its very relevant.

Care to expand?     

&gt;Religion doesn't aim to do that in the first place. You're comparing apples and oranges.

Yes, that's been my entire point over the past 5 or so posts.    I'll leave it to you to explain why I can't compare the efficacy of two world views in the context of social relevance as an information heuristic.


And just for kicks, can you explain how religious _anything_ can produce knowledge?

&gt;That still isn't a rational reason for why I should value Science over Religion.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Just as behavioral economics is a hybrid discipline of cognitive psychology and economics, neuroeconomics is a hybrid discipline of neuropsychology and economics. They use neural data to see how the brain makes decisions. There are plenty of monkey experiments with actual measurement of neural activity (they literally drill holes in the monkeys' skulls) and have them perform tasks, lots of fMRI experiments, things done with lesion patients and my personal favorite, the trans-cranial magnetic pulse which literally TURNS OFF some parts of the brain.

It is a very young discipline and, obviously, some of the findings need to be taken with caution (especially given the state of fMRI research) but it's opening lots of interesting doors. My favorite experiment was done by Colin Camerer at Caltech, they had people play the ultimatum game while in fMRI machines.

For those not familiar, the ultimatum game works like this: there are two players, a proposer and a responder. The proposer is allocated some amount of money, say $10. He then gets to choose an amount of the $10 to offer to the responder. The responder gets to accept or reject. If he accepts, both walk away with their respective amounts. However, if the responder rejects, both walk away with nothing. Conventional 'rational' theory predicts that the proposer should offer as little as possible and the responder should take it (since $1 is better than $0). Obviously, this doesn't happen and offers that are 'insultingly low' are generally rejected (this game has been done all over the world, there are interesting cross cultural differences which I can talk about if anyone's interested).

When Camerer did this experiment with the fMRI he had responders lie in a scanner and get offers from what they knew were computers and from other people. However, the people were secretly experimental confidants and some purposely made low offers to test the responders' reactions. The fMRI observed activation in regions of the brain whose activation has in other research been correlated with an affective feeling of 'disgust'  (such as when pictures of feces or maggots were shown to subjects) when low offers were known to be made by human subjects (but not when it was known that computers were making them)... it's an interesting finding that goes well along with the role of emotions as important components of decision making that some ev. psych theories push.

The biggest place for neuroeconomics right now is Caltech, followed by the Baylor College of Medicine and followed by NYU. There's a big debate internal to the economics community about whether we need neural data or whether just decision data is enough, which is an interesting topic in itself.","1262305204"

War sucks but soldiers cant all drop out and say oh well we don't like this particular war so we are gonna sit this one out. It is not the place of a soldier to make those kinds of decisions.
I personally do not agree with the reasons we invaded and I didn't before I shipped out. My personal or political view was irrelevant. I still did my duty and went there and carried out the missions assigned to me. None were ever to launch any incendiaries on civilians or anything similar.
If civilians want to question and protest and rage against the war I am all for it go nuts. I agree with you and I hope you can make a change in our government's policies.

In my experience, the body tends to work-up to whatever caloric influx you're giving it. So if you're eating ""up"" to 3000 cal/day, then your body will become acclimated to that caloric intake. This is, of course, presuming healthy calories (whole foods, etc).

Vegetarian protein sources tend to be lacking in two amino acids: lysine and methionine (source: [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002467.htm?debugMode=false#Food%20Sources)), .   Thus, having a mixture of plant foods (not just a single plant source) would be conducive to getting a complete amino acid profile.  You're conflating two COMPLETELY different ideas-- you're article was discrediting the idea that particular protein combinations were essential for vegetarians to have complete proteins, instead arguing that pretty much any plant combination would give an individual complete protein.  It, however, was not arguing against the idea of a complete protein vis-a-vis incomplete proteins, given that it is a well-defined concept in health literature.  ","1262305319"

What did it say in the article?  They were looking forward to saving $0.03 per pound of ground beef? That is what they sold safety for?  

I'll eat a small amount of beef, chicken or turkey occasionally if it was raised locally and organically on a pasture, and slaughtered carefully by a processor who is sanitary and keeps such products separate.

1. Its called Free Energy and it will be the catalyst in ending the monetary system. 
2. Its called Spiritually Growing Up.  Consciousness is changing, and no longer willing are people willing to put up with out-dated models of thinking of ""Might makes Right"" or just ""Take what you want and not give anything back.""  i.e. How can animals live on this planet for billions of years and yet they don't have taxes or pay for food??  Our primitive society is waking up to the fact that the only important thing in Life are Relationships, not Things.
3. Within the next 20 years, First Contact will finally put to rest a lot of archaic ideas that people still cling too.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;You are saying that if the Apostle Paul included any historical details of the life of Christ in his epistles you would consider those entries fraudulent?

What I'm saying is that much of what we consider to be important information was not considered as such in the ancient world.  They were much more concerned with what you did - not always who you were.  Ever wonder why there's no physical descriptions of people in the Bible?  Didn't matter.  In fact, if we did find documents with physical descriptions of people, we'd more than likely think them anachronistic.

 &gt;Yes. But, again, where and when did the Passion tradition originate. Paul gives us no idea.

Sure he does.  Read the order again - Jesus appeared to Peter, then the 12.  He's pointing to the origins of the Passion narrative.

&gt;Yes, he did report that people saw the risen Christ but nothing else. And, note that he does not say that anyone saw the risen Christ three days after he was crucified.

For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the **third day** in accordance with the Scriptures...

It would appear that Paul is saying that people saw the risen Christ three days after his crucifixion.

&gt;In Paul's universe, Christ could have been slain from the foundation of the world.

That's because Jesus was (cf. Revelation 13:8).

&gt;But what kind of argument is that? It sounds like you're saying: ""It's not there because God didn't put it there.""

* Dreams are your brains method to fix its problems. That is, troubling past experiences, stressful situations in one's everyday life, unresolved feelings and past emotions; all of the aforementioned aspects and more are addressed by the brain during dreams, and either solved or ""worked on"" depending on the severity. A person lives out the solutions in their dream to bring the brain to some type of closure. 

* Lucid dreaming. One can train themselves to become conscious in their dream and manipulate it however they want. 

The first and second conflict in the manner that if resolving one's issues is automatically done by the brain through dreams, how can you manipulate the actual dream? If you are conscious in your dream, a supposed state of healing oneself, then how can you know what to heal if only the brain's unconscious knows what troubles you? If one is able to manipulate their dreams, can their brain ever go back to it's normal function?

"politics","t5_2cneq","Part of the problem is you are comfortable enough to do nothing.  Not judging you but obviously your life is good enough where you are not compelled to go out and do something significant.  Like you say, you give $10 to calm your conscience and then zone out in front of your plasma screen.  Millions are in this position.  Plus, if we look at the recent protests of say the Tea Party movement, the media makes them look like a bunch of losers with nothing else to do but protest.  Whatever your belief of this group, they went out and did what you are criticizing others for not doing.  The other voices seem apathetic to action.  You don’t need an education to get out in the streets and organize.  But the media driven by corporate interests wants to make people look like loons especially those that protest.  Mass media is a tool to control people by watering down the desire to make significant change.  

Take the healthcare debate.  Did you go to a town hall?  Sure these turned out to be a bust because one side was more passionate about the debate while others sat at homes and said, “look at those nuts at those debates!  They know nothing.  Idiots.”  Well look at what kind of “reform” we are getting.  It is a large gift to the healthcare industry.  The day the Senate passed the bill healthcare stocks soared.

Wall Street keeps ripping people off because people take it.  Instead of blaming the corporate elite and going after the banking goons and marching through Wall Street in New York, people start attacking the poor as if some broke borrower in Ohio somehow brought the global economy to its knees.  All in all there were &lt; $2 trillion in subprime loans yet at the trough some $50 trillion in global wealth evaporated because of this crisis.  And what major change have we got?  Not much.  

One thing that did seem to move people to change however was the tanking economy.  We elected a President that stood for change (not sure if this is what we are getting), when gas was up to $140+ people stopped buying gas guzzling tanks, and it did seem like we had some momentum.  But now that the stock market seems to be coming up people are back at consuming and back on the hamster wheel.  

It does have to do with the education system.  Finance or civic duty is never taken seriously in high school or in college unless you study these fields directly.  How to manage your credit card?  Most people find out by jumping in the water and learning to swim.  Protesting?  Most people have no idea what this is or how to go about organizing.  

You want some simple solutions?  Take your money out of the corporate too big to fail douche bag banks and put it in your local community bank.  Start writing letters to your local representatives about what you want to see changed.  If that doesn’t happen organize with sites like http://www.meetup.com/ and bring people together in your local area.  Change can happen but you need to be the first one to make it happen.

Rosa Luxemburg and Liebnecht who were the theoretical foundation of the party were executed right before they could have taken the government, leaving an immature party of Communists at the lead who were very reactionary and ultra-left (see Left-wing Communism; An infantile disorder -Lenin) and could no longer connect to the people. They repeatedly made mistakes, and didn't take advice from Lenin whenever they had the chance, though there was a hard time getting communication back and forth from the Comintern to Germany.

After those two massive defeats, the rhetoric of unity and national pride from Hitler was very very appealing. These people really thought that The Nazis would rebuild Germany and bring them back to greatness.","1262305618"

If you are less naturally empathetic towards others - as in, you understand what's going on with them on a more ""intellectual"" level than a gut ""emotional"" level - then it's not necessarily a concern. This seems to be a trait that is different in different individuals - I am more on the logical-y side myself.

Adding on to that the verses which indicate that Jesus took the OT as factual (versus something that is malleable) lends strong evidence to the infallibility of the OT.  For all the verses in the OT that corroborate, presage, or expound into the NT, and for the common thematic elements that exist between the two, I'm fairly satisfied with inerrancy.

That said, I don't like things like KJV-only or Textus Receptus.  I think that the original Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic are where you can make a stand on inerrancy (given the above caveats), and that you have to be more flexible for the KJV, NIV, The Message, or Thomas Jefferson's Bible.","1262305641"

This Orwellian path ends in tyranny, and the process is lubricated by **OUR FEARS**.  The famous FDR quote, ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" is a deep realization of the core vulnerability of a free people.  We have to accept terrorism as a relatively tiny cause of death.  We should attack the cause of terrorism, not each emergence of the symptoms.  They are willing to suicide themselves to kill us for more than just religion.  The primary cause of the current terrorism is past transgressions WE COMMITTED AS A PEOPLE.

Any of the big four early dialogues would be a place to start, (*Apology*, *Crito*, *Euphythro* or *Phaedo*), most university students start reading Plato at the *Apology* because this cycle of dialogues opens up quickly into the big questions of philosophy and the relationship between the philosopher and non-philosophers.

Because you aren't under the constraint that introductory philosophy professors are (bring in as many of the important themes as possible in the allotted time,) there are two dialogues among the early dialogues that might be more satisfying to you because they talk about things that touch close to personal experience: the *Laches*, where the subject is ""what is courage?"" and the *Charmides*, where the subject is ""what is temperance ?""

&gt;Furthermore, define religious experience and prove that it's a real phenomena.

You don't think Religious experience is a real phenomenon? So all the billions of Religious people are simply lying to themselves about what they feel? Simply put, its "" a subjective experience where an individual reports contact with a transcendent reality, an encounter or union with the divine"" (wikipedia definition) 

&gt;Care to expand?

No.

&gt;Yes, that's been my entire point over the past 5 or so posts.  

Then what on earth is your point?

I did too. I still enjoy Shakespeare.

But even if they tune in to those teachers, they're learning analytical skills from the days of Shakespeare, and not from our current world. And we can't rely on every single teacher to be engaging.

No, actually, you want them reading BBC news. You want them analyzing CNN pieces. You want them analyzing Fox News. You want them exploring the world as it is, not as it was 300+ years ago.

Sorry that you can't comprehend such a complicated argument.  Radix2 decided his/her position was the only ""sensible"" one by painting those who oppose the death penalty as taking the sensible position.  As if his idea of sensible was infallible and those who opposed his position were not sensible.  Such an approach is hilarious because it's a self-proclaimed level of grandeur of his own position.  A person without the sense to attempt to disguise such a fallacious argument would have probably have put it more like, ""Only smart people are against execution these days.""  It's ridiculous.

&gt;Ok, I'm not appealing to emotion.

You absolutely are.  You are attempting to appeal to the emotions of people who may have feelings against the behavior of various countries who are engaged in capital punishment as a means to attack the act of capital punishment.  When you bring up X type of government not having it you are projecting the idea that Y government does have it.  X governments are, of course, desirable/respectable/etc in your and others' world view while Y governments are not.  As if pointing to a country who performs genocide and also performs capital punishment makes the act of capital punishment wrong.  Just because a country who performs acts that some people may find deplorable doesn't mean every single act they perform is horrible.

Your argument is linking capital punishment with other acts performed by a country.  Your argument points someone to look at a X country and compare to a Y country, see every single horrible act they are involved in and then have them think about the fact Y country also engages in capital punishment.  It's a clear appeal to emotion.

How about having someone address capital punishment on it's face, as an issue, rather than trying to link it with some oppressive regimes so you can appeal the emotion that comes with such a link?  If you want to talk capital punishment itself, as an item to be used in the justice system, to deal with criminals who have done the most heinous crimes conceivable, give me a call.  If you want to talk capital punishment, as it has been used and abused throughout the history of mankind and how Y country does it and X country doesn't, don't bother;  I don't give a fuck how some jackass leader A years ago did whatever the fuck when abusing this approach.  All it reminds me of is some dumbass telling me I can't smoke a fucking joint cause some stupid fucking idiot B years ago ran someone over.","1262305800"

A lot of Tibetan people are not that resentful, and the central government certified Panchen boy actually has a quite considerable following. Remember the Tantric Buddhism in Tibet also had been splintering through history, Dalai and Panchen are the heads of two biggest competing sects, and their seemingly coexistence are the very result of hundreds years of power struggling. Been the less influential sect, the followers of Panchen are happy without Dalai's nagging for the first time in a long history. Yeah, they have to deal with a paranoid central government now, but except a brief decades, they have been dealing with the vastly more powerful middle kingdom all along.

My uncle was sent to govern a district in Tibet (with a native co-sheriff) back in the 90's for about one and a half year. Life is really hard up there. The death of one yak calf could literally destroy a family. They had a dry out lake full of clear crystals, the residents sometimes prayed by the lake side, they were all deeply religious, buddhism is but the only escape. Yes they want their tulku back, but on the other hand the central government built the road, arranged business, facilitated the cellphone pole, electricity, clean water, medicine et al. I could sense the constant torn, but one thing was clear, my uncle was supported and loved by the locals, he received a excessive amount of hata clans when his term was over, and that was a rural area with only about 30K resident. I reckon that is the real face of Tibet, longing for a better material life while journeying through pilgrim.

Evidently the exile government still has some legitimacy in Tibetan's mind, but more and more Tibetans began to feel used, among the youngsters and poors this feeling are commonly shared. At this point, both sides all have a significant amount of support of Tibetans and I imagine neither will back off. But the thing is one side is enormously more powerful than the other, and the gap is growing everyday. And I know it is politically incorrect to say the losing camp should just admit defeat, but seriously, fueling more riot and media protest will have a next to nothing impact or could make the situation considerably worse (Xinjiang still have NO internet after 6 months, and the relationship between Han Chinese and Muslim keeps deteriorating.)

I'm very frustrated coz I don't have a clue how this can be solved, but I know one thing, the sabotage and conspiring need to stop, or there will be blood(not by the hand of government I might add) in a sense of full on racial conflict. Both side will lose, the weaker side can't afford to lose.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","TL;DR: Worth the price before this one-day sale (when I got it), even more worth the price now. Get it, you won't regret it.

Darwinia reminds me of Black and White, if you've ever played that.

The premise is basically this:
A virus invades Darwinia, which is a virtual theme park. It's populated by Darwinians, little green dudes that go around, live their lives, and may or may not have developed sentience through thousands of virtual generations.

You go in, spawn ""tasks"" (units), such as soldiers, engineers, etc. They go around, killing the virus or capturing buildings. They get more weapons as the game goes on, in the form of ""research"" scattered throughout the world, or upgrades you can choose from. Some buildings will spawn Darwinians, which can be used in battle or to finish map objectives.

The game is very beautiful, in a fairly unique way. It is, however, short. I finished it in just under ten hours. A map editor *is* unlocked with the end of the game, and that may extend the playability if you manage to find good maps. I haven't.

Multiwinia is, as the name implies, multiplayer Darwinia. You go around and kill other colored Darwinians in game modes ranging from king of the hill to beachead assault. Instead of controlling tasks as in Darwinia, you control the Darwinians directly. Research crates will occasionally drop randomly about the level, and they give powerups. The powerups can be things like APCs, increased Darwinian spawn, or even apocalyptic meteor showers to rain down upon your enemies.

When I checked available servers before the sale, they were all empty. Maybe that's been changed, now that the game has been on the front page of steam. It's great fun with a group of friends all on voice chat, though.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Thanks! That's always good to hear, especially since I have such a hard time being concise.

As for externalities and information in general, because I have been hearing this quite a bit lately, I would like to inquire just a bit more. ""Externalities"", as defined in a recent paper I read (I believe it was called ""Externality denialism"") are goods of the first order (that is, attributes of a good or service, not a good or service itself) that are not ""taken into account"" by individual consumption. I believe the most articulated argument was talking about the ""true cost"" of a particular item, and how the paid cost is not equal to the proposed ""true cost"", _vis-a-vie_ the cost to the environment. The proposed solution was a centralized committee which would presumably decide quite arbitrarily how much any particular good was worth.

Firstly, let me say that I agree with the title of the paper on externalities in that, as a libertarian, __I do not believe in externalities__. To be clear, what I am implying is that _all goods of the first order_ are taken into account during economic calculation. In other words, a person may abstain from buying gasoline because they believe it to be in the benefit of the Earth. In this way, the externaility (AKA: good of the first order) we call ""damage to the earth"" is _internalized_. As much as demand for Gasoline goes down, the price will be forced upwards (thus eeking towards what that particular abstaining individual would consider the ""true cost""). Of course, some people do not assign a value to protecting the earth, and in that case, even though the externality _is_ internalized, it is ignored. This is why Austrians call for education and freedom of ideas. If we can convince people to ""go green"", they will value ""going green"". Thus - instead of a centralized militarily-enforced law of conduct, we have an emergence of companies who cater to those attempting to protect the earth. When thought through, this is _actually how the world works_, even though we assume all order depends on the centralized agency.

As for asymmetric information, again, I see free people as the very best neural network for distributing information. Conversely, when a single entity is given control, I see nothing but failure. Consider the recent intelligence fiasco in Washington. As a methodological individualist, I do not see a difference between ""the government people"" and ""the people"". When one man from far away comes to my Gas Station and tells me how much gas I can sell (before he will put me physically in a cage), you might call it central planning - I call it tyranny. Not only is it tyranny (one man enforces his will against two totally separate and distinct other people), it is also the cause of our economic woes.

Anyways - there is to much to address here for Reddit. Let me just say: externalities do not exist when using a subjective theory of value; information is the true commodity of the human race (and no suit will make one more qualified to interpret said information than anyone else), and ""government-based solutions"" are (despite their kind intentions) the very core of them problem. What they boil down to is, ""I know better, so don't do X"". As a liberal, I happen to believe that as acting human beings, no one ""knows whats better"" for us than we do. This is the foundation of all of Austrianism.","1262305889"

If this is the case, then don't post anything at all about nutrition. (Also: *Dudette).  
  
&gt;I even said that if you know of one to let me know, I said I personally had never heard of a diet that included this.  
  
You can incorporate most anything into a diet, given proper planning and structure. Not too difficult. Since you're a newb, you should know now that most foods aren't ""taboo,"" so much as portion control, eating frequency, etc. are really top consideration. If you want to eat three slice of bread with Nutalla, wolf it down (with a protein shake) post-workout (say, hard full-body lift and some cardio). Voila! Incorporation indeed.  
  
&gt;How is my post stupid?   
  
Your post is stupid (i.e., betraying a lack of knowledge and/or understand) because of the displayed incredulity at eating bread + Nutella.   
  
&gt;I think you need to improve your reading comprehension skills and rethink what you're saying before you type it.
  
  
I read  and understood (and responded to) your comment just fine. Perhaps *you* are in need of adjusting reading comprehension and response?  

&gt;BTW I live in Argentina, only been to Miami once and NYC twice. I think NYC is overrated to be honest, bunch of lights and expensive stuff. I don't know what the general American diet consists of, just that there is a problem with obesity in that country and it probably includes McDonalds.  
  
I have never been to Argentina. Good on you for visiting America, though I'm not certain I'd classify Miami as the cultural epicetner of the 'States. I love New York City, but maybe I'm just biased. The ""McDonald's"" rhetoric is pretty bullshit, the Western diet as a collective entity is quite detrimental and non-nutritious; not just limited to fast food places.

I have not left the country since then except for 8 months (not continuous) last year. I have noticed this trend since I was 12. However, I only voiced my opinion one time and the feds showed up at my house. So I have kept my mouth shut. It is very much time for the citizens of america to stand in the face of the govt. and ""remind"" them that they work for us, not the other way around. The basic fear that exists in the average spineless american is something that those in power rely on. The fact that you are not willing to sacrifice the small comforts you have to actually make the world a better place is part of the fuel used by corporate america and its govt. cronies to keep the average american in their place, working and in debt until they die. That way, they can effectively stifle personal growth, keep creativity to a minumum, and retard forward progress. All three can destroy the system as it is.

The best course of action: organize in your community and boycott large corps. (walmart, att, verizon, merck, amazon, bestbuy). then, if you work at one of these places, arrange a day where no one goes to work. these corporate fat cats would be nothing without the workers. I bet if the people of this country sat at home one day, those corporate assholes would change their tune super fast.  and whoever said that thing about multiculturalism brings division, you are wrong. this country was founded on multiculturism...in fact, that is why this country has become so great. so great in fact that people still want to move here even with all the bullshit. 

so in conclusion, fuck wal-mart, don't use ur cellphone for the internet and only call when you have to, and arrange in ur community to kick the corporations out of your neighborhood (start a community garden, shop from local stores and stay away from the national chain stores). 

remember what this country was founded on...

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.","1262305986"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Allow me to Fisk:

&gt;Why do we seem to be plagued with 3rd-world country problems when we should be, by all rights, near (or at) the very top of the quality-of-life index?

Our culture is made up of a variety of different cultures that gradiate with location and via social connections (South side of Chicago is a whole different culture than a north suburb; or the same with a deep rural Appalachian town).  you can't summarize the culture of a Nation as large as ours let alone blame all the problems on that false reduction.

&gt;Why do we allow ourselves to be taken advantage of? Wall Street bailout, wildly unpopular wars, no universal healthcare, we basically just roll over and take it.

Because the alternative will be a greater threat to progress than not. Sounds counterintuitive, I know, but if you look at the nuances of the recent economic crash, many of ""us"" were just as responsible as Wall St.  

&gt;Look back at the 60s and the anti-vietnam war movement. Aside from some mostly symbolic marches in major cities, what have we done to show our discontent with the whole Iraq/Afghanistan thing?

We did. I marched in Feb 2003.  It was part of the largest non-violent (international) anti-war protest ever ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_15,_2003_anti-war_protest)).  Regarding Vietnam, even Chomsky said:  

 ""There is a lot of comparison between opposition to the Iraq war with opposition to the Vietnam war, but people tend to forget that at first there was almost no opposition to the Vietnam war""

&gt;I'd like to say the education system is to blame, but the reality of it is that people in the US have never really valued education. We deride people who are academically-inclined or educated, we praise the ""self-made man"" who made something of himself without the need for formal training, we call them nerds, book-worms.

""Self made"" still seems a pretty embedded American value to me (meaning, a value in most of American subcultures).  My guess is you're young, and it doesn't matter in which part of the world you grew up, but as youth brings creativity, challenge to the status-quo, vigor, freshness, and a renewed zest for life, it also presents our first experiences of peer-pressure, recklessness through inexperience, and fantasies of strict ideology that lights our imagination on fire with Utopian visions.  ""Self-made"" can be interpreted in many ways, but it is only the underrated medium of effective communication with others through which your ideas will ever be challenged and criticized enough  to be honed into something worthwhile.

&gt;No, we don't value education, we don't value culture, we rejected everything the ""old world"" taught us - threw the baby out with the bath-water, so now all we have left is an obscene culture of self-indulgence, self-gratification and self-obsession.

No we don't.  Some people do, but it depends where you go.  I know plenty of people (and you're now one of them) who don't value this stuff.  Believe me, in the West, we number in the millions.  You're not alone, and just because there are extreme examples being paraded around on the ""news"" and tv reality shows only means that those people merely generate enough outrage to get ratings (remember, the MSM is seeing it's ratings drop in droves to find more suited and accurate information through the internet, so it;s only an old media form getting desperate, nothing more.)

&gt;We'd be off oil in a month if we wanted, if we really truly wanted.

Yeah, and then we'd really be experiencing thrid world conditions. All of us.  We need Nuclear, IMHO (whole other discussion).

&gt;If you live in the suburbs, you're the problem. If you buy cheap food/goods, you're the problem. If you don't vote, you're the problem. If you don't take an active role in your community, you're the problem. No one is going to make your life better for you except for yourself.

What if you don't have a complaint about your own life?  See i've been through the 5-7 year bout of self-criticism (both individual and cultural) and what it comes down to is:  We are fortunate enough to have grown up in a relatively safe and modern society to even be capable of developing critical thought (you think have time to wax philosophically if your family is dying from starvation, genocide, disease, poverty, etc. etc.?).   Now that more and more people are that fortunate, things are changing.  The world is more [peaceful now than ever before](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence.html).  There has been significant progress in our culture in the past, even 30 years.  Most of us were'nt alive during vietnam, segregation, the inquisition etc.   So don't worry. It's just evolution.  Keep on donating and voting and doing the things your heart tells you to do. You're helping more than you know, and you're not alone...

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Waking Life was not a philosophy lecture: it was a movie *about people having philosophies*, just like Slacker was.  Those who always try to pick these films apart for being pretentious always miss the bus on this one - Linklater's critics, are, themselves, the kind of people he likes to feature in his films - the kind of people he is amused by.  Undoubtedly he has his ideas on the world, but his focus here is the novelty of people, and how they think.  Too many of the characters have contradictory ideas or personalities to make any conclusion on ideas Linklater himself holds or is trying to push - which does, in fact, make me think people don't understand them.

If you're on reddit, and you read subreddits based on ideas (religion, politics, philosophy, economics), you, yourself, might as well be a character in Linklater's dreams.

This is my relationship to the Internet as a whole:  Those who have philosophies and ideas on life are generally far more interesting than the actual belief systems they advocate.  I sit here in front of this monitor every day looking for interesting people expressing interesting ideas.  How I feel about the ideas or opinions is secondary to how I will feel about the person holding them.

It sounds like you're still slightly attached to your ex or the memories of her.  I suggest cutting her out of your life entirely (avoid her at all costs, no matter what.)  Make new friends, follow MicheleClaire's advice about living your own life.  Give it some more time and don't worry so much about falling in love or being in a relationship.

"canada","t5_2qh68","The ""Royal Prerogative"" is the last vestige of actual power held by the Governor General. Where powers within the royal prerogative have not been extinguished via legislation or convention, those powers remain available to the Governor General. In my opinion, the decision to prorogue parliament is a decision that has definitely not been overridden by legislation and I would further argue that a convention has not emulsified the power to such a degree that it is effectively a rubber stamp (in contrast, there is an unquestionable convention that when the prime minister wishes to dissolve parliament, the governor general must obey the request).

Consequently, in my opinion, the governor general is not bound to rubber stamp the prime minister's request given the type of request. The situation would be far different if the governor general sought to refuse to sign off on validly passed legislation or to refuse to call an election (like the Byng affair). The power to progrogue is just that, it is a power, exercised at the discretion of the office holder subject only to the decision being made with no improper considerations.

One of the nightmares I remember the most vividly was so insanely dumb that you're going to think I'm making it up.

It starts I'm in a car with my dad. We're out in a rural area and we start to go up a big bridge. We keep going up and up and up until I get a real sense of height vertigo (I'm scared of heights). I keep asking my dad to stop, but he doesn't say anything. Eventually we get to the top, but the bridge just stops. Now I really start panicking. I'm holding onto my dad's arm pleading for him to stop but he doesn't. We get right to the edge, teeter over the top, and fall into what looks like a forest below us.

Inexplicably we're both fine and begin walking thru the woods. We come to a small town where we learn of a serial killer on the loose. He kills people using bananas (yeah this is where it starts to get weird btw). The rest of my memory of the dream is especially hazy but a few things happen. My dad dies from a giant banana being dropped on him. I meet the serial killer. A humongous banana is dropped on the entire town killing us all.

Then I woke up. I've only had that dream once, but it is (mostly) engraved into my memory. I must have had it when I was less than 10 years old for sure, but I honestly don't remember how old I was.

* How big are your clients?

* What kind of jobs are you hired to do? Full trading systems from scratch? Or are they trying to add some intelligence to an existing system?

* Do you keep in touch with past clients? If so, did any of your systems blow up in the last 2 years?

Sure it worked for chronic clinical depression, but it felt like I was becoming detached... looking back I think I just glazed over for the good part of 6 months.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I tend to think of EMDR the same way that I think of most therapy - it's a way to try to get people to do some form of exposure and response prevention. 

Let me explain. I think a lot of human suffering comes from trying to avoid negative thoughts and emotions. By the way, this is an idea most clearly expressed in [Acceptance and Commitment Therapy](http://www.contextualpsychology.org/). 

And I think most therapy is trying, in one way or another, to get people to have a different relationship with their thoughts and feelings. By different relationship, I mean: somehow feel more willing to have those emotions and not try to suppress, or deaden, or run away from, those feelings and thoughts. 

The classic way to do this is [exposure and response prevention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_and_response_prevention) - you *expose* the person to what they are avoiding (e.g., needles; reminders of specific traumatic events), and *prevent* them from doing what they would normally do (e.g., run screaming from the room; self-medicate with meth). 

In EMDR, the psychologist has the person expose themselves to normally-avoided things - thoughts, emotions, cues that remind them of the trauma, etc - while following their finger with their eyes. As far as we can tell, the active ingredient in the therapy is the expsoure. If the eye movements do anything, we don't know what it is. 

But, hey, if the eye movements make it easier to develop that different relationship with whatever it is you're avoiding, then I say go for it.

Well, that means all of the stories that came to mind that I was going to dismiss as ""not random enough"" actually qualify, so here's one of my favorite memories:

I was visiting a girl I knew, not that well, but I'd cuddled with her before and was very attracted to her.  I'd never visited her at her place before (she lived far away from me, I was on a road trip) and she said I could spend the night, so I was hoping for a hookup, but I really didn't know and was going to be okay either way - no major expectations.

I get there and figure out in passing that she's planning to put me in her bed, because she has me put my stuff in her room and there's only this one bed there to sleep in.  I still don't know if that means sex or cuddling, but either way, it makes me happy and I'm looking forward to it.

She has some plans with her friends so we go hang out with them.  I meet her roommate and a bunch of friends.  Roommate is hot, and I find one of the friends really hot too, but I ignore that and do nothing about it because I already know I'm gonna spend the night with her and I'm happy with that.  Even though at one point when several of us are in her roommate's room and roommate, with her shirt off, gives me a backrub - that still doesn't distract me.

Eventually everyone else goes home, roommate goes to her room, and girl and I go to bed and yeah, she had also intended a hookup.  She turns out to be one of the most fun people to give head to ever.  Yay!

So after we're both (temporarily) done and resting, she gets up, says she's going for a moment, I forget if it was to the bathroom or to get a drink or what, but I lie in bed happily and the minutes pass... and I start wondering why she's not back, so I go out into the hallway and hear chatting from her roommates' room.

She'd gone in there to bum a cigarette from her roommate, and they were very close friends so they quickly fell into conversation and got distracted.  They're happy to welcome me into their conversation so I sit on the bed chatting with them.  And then we're all lying down on the bed talking, and my friend (I think we've gotten past ""acquaintance"" at this point) and I are cuddling and ... I don't remember exactly how it started, but eventually she's sitting up with her legs around my head and I'm giving her head again.  Getting really turned on by this...  and then I feel her roommate's mouth on me.  I really was not expecting it.

I ended up staying an extra day and another night, and getting swapped back and forth between the two of them for most of that day and night.  I always leave some time leeway on my roadtrips so that I can go with the flow and spend more time somewhere if it turns out to be more fun than I expected :)","1262306249"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Even when Christ, God in the flesh, walk on this earth, people did not believe.

And Paul did not mention that Christ walked on this earth.

&gt;Paul is not disclaiming the role that Christ had in his ministry on earth.

He probably would not disclaim an idea he had never heard. He neither claimed it nor disclaimed it. He didn't mention it.

&gt;Paul is simply expounding on the universal truth that occurred even when God himself was on this earth

...without ever mentioning that God himself was on this earth.

&gt;I think Christ, John, Paul, Peter and James' Christologies all line up without contradiction.

Matthew 5:17

""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; **I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.**

Ephesians 2:14

**For he himself is** our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 15 by **abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations.**

Jesus went on to say that ""not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished"".

What did he mean by ""everything""? By ""everything"", he was referring to the events leading up to and including his own second coming. Unless you are a Full Preterist, the second coming has yet to occur. Jesus says, the law is still in effect. Paul disagrees.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Spivak is good but it doesn't follow the current ""standard"" curriculum, so you can use it to gain a deeper understanding, but you won't be able to study for your class from it.

Stewart I &amp; II is not bad.  It's good for being precisely what it is: a chapter-by-chapter guide to the current curriculum.  If you want to pass your classes, all you need is Stewart's; but the questions are all rather easy and just variations on what you might get asked on a quiz or test, so it won't really drive you to think outside the box.

Stewart won't go into details or proofs, unless it's absolutely vital for being able to solve the questions.  It's all sort of ""here is what this means -- here is how you solve such a question with this method; here is how you solve this other kind of question -- Next chapter.""

Stewart has the ""problems plus"" section (problems that are hard), but since the book itself doesn't read at this level, they're all just seem out of the blue, because the book never prepared you to deal with such problems in the first place.

Stewart III (multivariable; vectors) is **horrible**.  I had to buy a different textbook because it was so bad.  It literally feels like a Schaum's study guide.  

If you want a book that's at a bit of a higher level than Stewart's, but more or less follows the same curriculum, check this one out: http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-I-Undergraduate-Texts-Mathematics/dp/0387909745/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1262305260&amp;sr=8-2

**The Sock Monster**

Every time Mum does the washing, she sighs and scratches her head. “Where is the sock that goes with this one?” she asks.

I look at my one, lonely sock and shrug. “I don’t know,” I say. “I put them both in the laundry basket...”.

When Grandpa comes to visit, Mum complains about the missing socks.

“Look at this!”, she says, and shows him a whole bag full of socks without their partner. “Where do they go?!”

Grandpa smiles and nods. He knows lots of things. “Ah!,” he says “it must be the sock monster! They love collecting socks!” ""Why do they collect socks, grampa?""

""I don't know,"" says grampa, ""but they took my socks when I was a boy, and my grandads socks when he was a boy! They've been doing it for a long time!""

I decide to set a trap and catch the sock monster. I want my football sock back..

At bedtime, I get a sock that my gran bought me for Christmas. I don’t like the bright stripey colours, but I know a sock monster would love them..

I tie a piece of string on the end of the sock. The other end of the string, I tie to my big toe..

I switch off the light, jump into bed, and close my eyes..

I try to stay awake, and wait..

...and wait...

...and wait...

...and zzzzzzzzz…

Something tugs on my toe. It wakes me up.

I see my sock moving across the room towards the pile of dirty clothes in the corner. Then I spot it - there, in the corner - the dark shape of the sock monster.

I jump up and switch on the lamp. The sock monster blinks. He has purple, shaggy fur, huge googly eyes, and something even more strange….only one leg!

“Hey!” I shout, “Where’s my football sock?”.

The sock monster looks very surprised. “I entered it into the Great Sock Competition.” he says. “It won third prize!”

“The Sock Competition?” I ask. “What’s so great about socks that you enter them in a contest?”

“What’s great about socks? Are you kidding? Just look at them! They’re soft, colourful, and they smell wonderful!” He holds my stripey sock to his face and rubs it lovingly. I wrinkle my nose because I know he’s smelling one of my stinkiest socks.

“Well, you shouldn’t steal socks. People need them.” I say.

“We only ever take one”, says the sock monster. “We’re not greedy.”

I point to his one leg and tell him ‘you may only need one, but we need two! Look, we have two legs”.

“Ah, I never thought of that. I suppose we should find something else to collect then.”

I thank him, and he says goodbye then disappears under the pile of dirty laundry.

In the morning I find a heap of socks on the end of my bed, including my lost football sock. Sock monsters are pretty good guys after all.

From the laundry I hear my mum yelling again...

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Your first point of married people wearing rings was better than the single guys shaving and putting on a shirt. As well as the single straight guys, I'd think that gay married men also stay clean shaven and put on a nice shirt when they go out.
From a few random google searches, it seems that rings have symbolized a sort of eternity since they took form for basically any culture that's used them. It's a universal sign, I guess. Obviously I can't say with certainty that the ring was meant to symbolize eternity when its use was first started. That said, their purpose was never solely reserved for symbolizing marriage. They have been decoration, accessory and of course the symbol of friendship or marriage.


Handkerchiefs, on the other hand, were not created as a way to symbolize gay fetishes. I specify gay because wikipedia said the code was mainly for gay men. They were in their earlier forms both a symbol of wealth and simply a tool for carrying things or hygiene purposes. The symbolization of wealth was mainly due to their cost, much like a person owning a Ferrari or Bentley. It was only until in the last 120 years or so that they started being used by a group to indicate fetishes, at least according to the handkerchief code on wikipedia.

I know you'll find plenty of counter examples to what I'm about to cover, but I'll explain my thinking anyway. Handkerchiefs are for hygiene and carrying a picnic lunch, covering your face from the weather, things like that. It has a well known, established use. When a group of people decides to start using something with an already established meaning to mean something else it causes great confusion and sometimes hostility. It is a bad thing. The best example I can come up with is related to gang violence. Gang colors or clothing combinations to indicate that you are with a gang. Random guy happens to be wearing the color and clothing combo, walking down the street.. happens to be noticed by a gang member recognizing those as enemy colors. Random guy gets shot. If the social group hadn't decide to make that color/clothing combo represent something it wasn't, the guy probably wouldn't have gotten shot. Say a man wears rainbow on his shirt. Man gets beat up by people that don't like gay guys. Is the man gay or not? Who knows, they just think rainbows are associated with gay people so they didn't bother asking if he was gay. Rainbows didn't start out as a gay symbol. They were a combination of colors and an arc-ish shape, a natural phenomenon. 

I hope somewhere in this large amount of text you understand why I might see something wrong with using already established things as symbols of something else. It can lead to all sorts of trouble.","1262306527"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;I mean that in the sense that if you do the intuitive thing, it will have security holes. You have to work to make it secure.

If that intuitive thing is to take a command you just learned and put it into practice without actually reading what its capable of. Then yes, but with just a little looking at the php guide on [include](http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php) you should be able to tell the power of the command. It makes no attempt to hide the fact you can run remote code using it. Therefore leaving it open to run remote code with no checks is a programmer issue.

They also have what seems to be a clear cut way to prevent remote code execution
&gt;If ""URL fopen wrappers"" are enabled in PHP (which they are in the default configuration), you can specify the file to be included using a URL

I can't change my php.ini without contacting tech support since I am cheap and have a shared hosting so I don't get access to that. A quick phpinfo() shows mine is on, but I assume if I turned it off it would stop http:// requests from being included (as the above states) and then would eliminate the exploit completely. Is that not sufficient protection?

&gt;This is more like a gun that fires at random, where the safety is off by default.

I can give you half of this, since it is my understanding URL fopen wrappers being off would eliminate this problem and it is on by default. Maybe it should be off by default?  However it is hardly random if you fail to check on how secure the code you are intending to use is, and it gets exploited.","1262306539"

I can't tell you what happens at the center (the singularity) because the equations break down at that particular point, but it's reasonable to think of it working like a neutron star (magnatar, electroweak star, whatever floats your boat) for points that aren't the singularity.  That is, it rotates, make [jets](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080428-mm-black-hole-blazar.html) has EM fields and the like.  Except, that what goes in stays in.  For good.  
For topic 6:  The gravity exerted by one object on another gets weaker the farther out you go.  So, there's a (very) subtle difference in the strength of gravitational attraction from the Earth on your head and on your feet.  In the extreme gravity of a black hole environment that difference is orders of magnitude larger, so whatever's closer to the black hole gets accelerated more than what's farthest away.  Eventually this will rip whatever's there to shreds on the atomic level.  Because gravitational attraction involves acceleration, it's felt in every reference frame.

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt; The defenders of Wall Street pay usually rely on a rather familiar argument. It goes something like this: CEOs demand millions because they deliver profits, which are passed along to their shareholders. And, the argument goes, corporate executives who aren't paid well will simply pack up and take their vaunted leadership skills somewhere else.

I thought the argument went something like this: ""We hire CEOs to take the big risks that could lead to major profitability, but those same risks could lead to failure.  If we paid CEOs based on stock performance or profit, they'd be scared to take risks, and we'd miss out on the best opportunities.  That's why we pay them a lot whether their risks go well or badly, and why we pay more for the higher risk-takers we can snatch from other companies that have recently failed.""

Now maybe this isn't the argument they want to be touting a lot in public right now, when the idea of giving top executives incentive to take bigger risks doesn't look very good.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree with souleh: Dreamweaver/Fireworks wouldn't be the worst way to learn more about how to build a web site, but personally I think you'd be better off doing it by hand and using tools like Firebug and Web Developer (or the not-as-awesome equivalents in Safari/Chrome/Opera) to inspect and mentally deconstruct existing sites. Keep taking classes and reading online to supplement and explain what you find.

The problem with letting a program do this for you is twofold:

1) The software just isn't good enough to create reliable, cross-browser compatible code for anything more than a mom-and-pop site.

2) The generated code is generally a pain to maintain and extend after the initial build, and is only useful for static sites.

For background, I've been a web developer for nearly a decade. I'm entirely self-taught, so it is possible. One of the first things I look for when hiring young developers is whether they have copy/pasted or program-generated Javascript/CSS/HTML in their portfolio pieces. Automatic disqualification in my book.

TL;DR = Use the program to learn how to build a site, then learn how to do it yourself. Relying on a program forever will handicap your ability as a developer (and designer, in most cases).","1262306607"

It wouldn't necessarily have to be large-scale organized crime, because supposedly you can get locally-grown weed that comes from relatively reputable people, but it's hard to know for sure.  I know that not far from here, across the border in Mexico, there's a ton of drug-related violence, and I know that *some* weed comes from Mexico, and I feel like if I bought drugs, I couldn't be sure whether I was contributing to that or not.  So I find it simpler just to avoid them.

Now, a few things:

* This is not an inherent property of the drugs.  I'm not saying it's necessarily morally wrong to use drugs.  I'm just saying that it *might* be morally questionable given the status quo, where drugs often come via organized crime.
* I'm not saying people who use drugs should be put in jail.  I don't think they should.  I think it's pretty damned wasteful and pointless, actually.

My point is, drug users are largely innocent, but I'm not sure they're absolutely, 100% free of some tinge of moral culpability.  They know the situation, which is that there is some risk that they're enriching a corrupt, violent organization.  They didn't set it up that way, but that's how it is regardless.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","The prevalence of a tendency to tell stories about resistance to colonizers not only from the perspective of a colonizer who switches sides but one who does so by proving himself stronger than the natives and becoming their Leader/Master is indicative of some fucked up racist tendencies within our society.

The prevalence of a tendency to tell stories about indigenous peoples that valorizes, essentializes and drastically simplifies their existence is indicative of some fucked up racist tendencies within our society.

Flat cartoons of characters bundled with cultural or social structures (yay fucking tribal hierarchies) that are implicitly addressed as beyond moral reproach or scrutiny is indicative of a cultural relativism with strong roots in the history of our society's shitty, sub-par and often counterproductive efforts to grapple with racism.

For an example of a similarly conceived movie that approaches the conflict of colonization from a relatively different and more complex angle rather than defaulting on the same ol'. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_for_Terra

But.  Unto itself, the rejected foriegner who is adopted by a tribe and fights his old tribe is an ancient and entirely valid plot concept.  And there ARE plenty of Science Fiction or space fantasy stories told from the perspective of the colonized.  It's just that the subjects are always human (cf Independence Day, The Mount) because doing justice to the truly alien defies the bandwidth of storytelling.  Avatar's problem is that the Navi aren't alien in the slightest -- they're deliberately made to be recognizable as our (simplistic, essentialist, idealic) impression of indigenous americans.  This is both shallow and a bit fucked up.  And it's the reason Avatar tragically falls short of being a great film.  It is, however, I think, a very good film.  Avatar is composed of a jumble of concepts, themes and struggles that work well together but defy simple summation.  Nevertheless it's worth pointing out just how positively many of them wax towards scientific inquiry and transhumanist self-expansion.  Jake Sully is a broken, impoverished, outcast and marginalized man who desires nothing more than to excel -- all his life he attempted this by following orders.  But only by marrying his desire to self-improve with his twin brother's desire to learn does he trancend both their failures and achieve the freedom and community he craves.  But Grace Augustine is really what makes this film for me.  How many decades has it been since we had scientists -- much less scientific inquiry itself -- portrayed in a positive light?  I almost cried.  Avatar has the most beautiful and realistic starship ever portrayed on the screen http://www.pandorapedia.com/doku.php/isv_venture_star.  It has imperialist soldiers being taken out by pteranodons.  What the fuck more do you want?","1262306766"

"reddit.com","t5_6","The Sharpe ratios tend to be very low for most segments, particularly about .1 above market on segments like helpful posters and people who only post things that every one agrees with. These are the investments where a steady dividend is what I am after. My riskier segments tend to have a higher though short-term volatile Sharpe, because they are more likely to increase or decrease in value.

I have found that the covariance between trolls and other segments has been decreasing over time. As the number of stocks available has increased, the ability of trolls to negatively affect whole segments has actually decreased, except for very new stocks which risk total liquidation in the event of high troll volatility. An increase in value in new users also has some positive correlation to value of helpful posters, as more noob questions means more opportunity to answer them.

1. With a straight razor, it takes longer than shaving with a mach3, so I generally leave it for special occasions and long lazy mornings. A DE actually takes me *less* time than a mach3, because I have very thick hair and usually shave every 3-4 days, so the cartridge clogs every two seconds, and I need to constantly rinse it out.

2. I see a definite difference in longevity between mach3, DE and straight razor. The mach3 gives the least close shave, requiring me to shave again soon. The straight razor gives the closest, and leaves me smooth for a good long while. The DE razor is somewhere in between, but doesn't leave any razor burn (unlike the straight razor, probably an issue with my technique) or shaving bumps (unlike the mach3, probably an issue with cartridges sucking terribly).

If it's not obvious from those answers, a DE razor is my regular choice.","1262306820"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Knowing Apple products, the tablet will be *nearly* ideal for casual use at home... but it will then be completely crippled by a ""helpful feature"" that you can't turn off.

For example:

iPhone - the tilt sensor cannot be disabled. Changing tracks while walking is impossible because coverflow keeps activating; Safari is completely crippled for browsing while you're lying down on your side. No indicator LED light, so you can't see if you've got voicemail unless you turn the phone on.

AppleTV - a software power switch means the fucking thing won't stay turned off unless it's unplugged.

I can almost guarantee that those utter fucktards at Apple think they know best and are going to slip in a couple of infuriating ""features"" like that in the tablet.

So my ""worst-case"" prediction the iTablet is:

* It'll have an unkillable tilt sensor.
* Won't read non-DRM'ed eBooks.
* Requires a wireless data plan or MobileMe subscription.
* The metal body is slippery and hard to hold.
* Shitty battery life with no power switch.
* No indicator LED light.
* Back-mounted camera, no microphone (no videophone for you!)
* Does not sync to a desktop over WiFi.
* No wireless power (like the Palm Pre) - and a new dock connector to mess with instead.
* Bad screen: fingerprint magnet / cannot be viewed in direct sunlight.
* Would work better with a stylus, but uses finger touch anyway.

If Apple gets their shit together - it could be awesome. But I'm taking a ""wait and see"" attitude because given how terrible the AppleTV is, I'm almost convinced that their success with the iPhone was a fluke.","1262306861"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt; Trying to troubleshoot issues with console games is nearly impossible.
No kidding!  I play console games instead of PC games for the simplicity (configuration?  Get out...) and the cost (I want to play the latest games with a 3-year old laptop, and that's not going to happen).  So when I get a console issue, I get a little nuts.  I couldn't sync my trophies for a month and a half and became *obsessed* with it... until I realized trophies are junk and just forgot about it until Sony finally upgraded the PSN's hardware in Canada and I could sync again.  Now I still don't care :).

I've started a new game with a fresh install (which means the patch downloads before the initial install-to-HD instead of the other way round), but I'm not hopeful that the problem will go away.

Adding insult to injury is that I can't log in to EA support (if there is such a thing).  It won't accept my password anymore, I've tried the account upgrade (apparently they've tried to amalgamate all the different PS3, X-box and PC accounts on their site), and still can't get in, and the last 3 times I've tried to create a fresh account it's given me an error.

I'm willing to admit EA is a pretty miserable company... all I want is for them to fix their fucking game... they gave the NFS franchise a reboot with such promise, fix the bugs for the love of FSM.","1262306870"

False dichotomy. There's nothing mutually exclusive about following the Geneva convention and holding prisoners. The problem was with torture and lack of due process, not in holding people who actually are dangerous and actually can be found guilty in a legitimate trial.

There's a crucial middleground between ""Let's waterboard them, even though we're not even sure they did anything wrong"" and ""Let's set them free to Saudi Arabia even though we're certain they did, and let them get re-established after a couple weeks at a swank retreat"".

Our culture doesn't raise us to be robots; in fact, it encourages us to become the exact opposite, which is *why* Americans hold 'the self made man' in such high esteem and why we're so protective of our natural rights. If you want to blame anything for our apathy, blame technology; television, the internet, the microwave, we're surrounded by conveniences that have left us all with short attention spans.","1262307123"

Just down-loaded this. Its superb. I would go so far as to say the best piece of software I've ever used.

Not that any one gives a shit, but here is my web browser history

* netscape 2 - wtf is this web thing?
* netscape 3 - this web thing is ok
* ie 3 (school intranet) - intranet is balls.
* 1998: first PC. packard bell cyrix 333 with 32 MB of RAM. netscape and IE 4/5 are too ram intensive so I'm forced to the trial version of opera (on win98) with a crack from astalavista
* 1999 opera versions came and went and yet it stayed. 
* 2000 i'm at uni and the status quo remains for i cannot spare money for a new PC. (opera now has ads). I try to write a web browser to find that the complexity of the software is so beyond my time and talent i couldn't come close in a million years
* 2001 - status quo
* 2002 new pc. windows XP. Try firefox. i.e just seems lacking.
* 2002.5 move to linux entirely. (been part time since 1999). konqueror i use a lot, but am not often devoted to the web. dial up makes all web a luxury still.
* 2003 - the web is rubbish but for a little still image pron
* 2004 - the web! it has learning things on it
* 2005 - the web! this thing could get HUGE. Oh wait. it is. at work i use netscape suite (now seamonkey) on solaris sparc. Then i eventually got opera on sparc. Mailed them about getting opera on solaris x86. Took years to get it :)
* 2006 - opera
* 2007 - opera
* 2008 - opera (solaris x86-64)
* 2009 - opera... then.. chromium from ppa. 
2009/2010 -&gt; back to opera. love the sync functionality, the speed, the irc and the mouse gestures. firefox mouse gestures lag a lot.

anyways I am making a braised pork shoulder.  Here's the recipe. I shoulda filmed it. It's going well so far. 

7 lb. pork shoulder end, lots of skin 

2 tbsp raw sugar

2 tbsp whole cumin

9 cloves garlic

2 tbsp chili powder

2 tbsp garam masala

1 tbsp mustard seed whole

1 tsp 5-spice

1 tsp herbes des provences

2 tbsp kosher salt

1 tsp whole black peppercorns

2 tbsp tomato paste

2 tbsp olive oil

1/2 cup fresh apple cider, water

tbsp natural tamari optional

1 whole onion, quartered


blend up the spices, onion and garlic. you might want to add some more pepper or heat but i'm a bit of a weakling in the spice dept. rub on meat. fridgerate for at least 4 hours.  add apple juice and water to pan, we want a moist arena of hot yummy in the oven, so cover tightly and bake.


i just tasted some and it's perfectly cooked EXCEPT: i din't crisp the skin! AAARG!!!! also too salty whew. ended up with about a cup of liquid and all that salt was too much for it. but the meat is well seasoned all the way through. i might just make a roux or cream sauce with this pork goodness salty concentrate.  

The flavour is like it looks, a bit of a fusion barbeque sauce. this is pulled pork practically. internal temperature is way too high at 210+ but anyways it's safe at least.

anyways i put it on 300f for 4 hours skin side down then flipped it over and broil on low for 45, checking every five mins. the colour was right but the skin is soft ;(

how does i cracklins i forgetted?

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Sensory Integration Disorder is a fascinating, and problematic, subject for me. A *lot* of kids that I see have been ""diagnosed"" with SID or SPD before they come to see me, despite the fact that there is really no such diagnosis (as in, it's not in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). 

I think the problem is that neuropsychologists (NPs) and occupational therapists (OTs) look at the same problem through different lenses. Many kids certainly do have the ""problems"" that the OTs are noticing. Some kids can't handle seams on their socks, or having their teeth brushed, or eating differnt foods; other kids are hyperactive and unfocused. No NP would dispute that.

The problem is that these difficulties are somewhat *sensitive*, but in no way *specific*. LOTS of kids (like 40%) have these difficulties. But it's sort of like having a fever - you know something **might** be wrong, but not what might be wrong. 

Many kids who avoid sensory stimuli actually need to develop better coping mechanisms. Society has convinced us that children should never be unhappy, and so parents often feel reluctant to encourage their children to just ""deal"" with things like sock seams. Instead of helping their child to learn how to handle the discomfort (e.g., teaching them distraction techniques, or to 'try if for five minutes and if you still notice them after that, then take them off'), the parents immediately rip the socks off and decide that their child ""can't handle"" sock seams. 

(I should mention that these are good, loving, well-intentioned parents. But coping is a muscle - kids have to learn how to solve problems by being exposed to problems to solve.)

Other kids with sensory problems may actually have ADHD, or Asperger's, or Anxiety, or a host of other problems. So the sensory problems are telling you that there is **something** atypical about their neurodevelopment, but not actually **what** that is. In other words, OTs look at sensory problems as a disorder; NPs tend to think of sensory problems as a possible symptom.

There is currently no good evidence than any of the available sensory integration therapies ""work"", nor any good reason why they should. But I hear all the time from parents who swear up and down that the therapy changed their child's life. I tend to think that when the therapy works, it is because it helped the child get used to something he didn't like... that is, it taught him how to cope. For instance, the kid doesn't like light touch, but the brushing feels kinda good and his therapist is a nice person and the therapy is fun, and over time the kid develops better tolerance for what he was previously avoiding.

Meanwhile, here's a nice passage from another translation of the [Tao Te Ching](http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm):

&gt; The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a
full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem
listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of
their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look
dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of
men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost
everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of
chaos.

&gt; Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be
benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull
and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as
if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while
I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone
am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao).

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;In exchange for that privilege I can be watched for whatever reason.

At least in the US, there are very strict laws concerning your home, be it rented or owned.  For example, even a landlord must give 24 hours notice before being allowed to enter, unless invited in (although there may be variances in State law.)

To be clear, walking down the street is a right.  Driving a car is a privilege (you literally sign away certain rights in order to obtain a license.)  Buses and trains are a more interesting point, because they are usually both publicly funded, and necessary for the regional economy.  That said, it's a fair point.  I believe the difference is that there have been repeated attempts in the US to hijack or destroy planes.  I'm sure that if buses were targeted, we would see increasing security measures there, as well.

&gt;At least in those scenarios it is typically necessary to have probable cause.

I believe that you're conflating the issues.  Probable cause comes into play when you are detained while otherwise within your rights.  In the case of security measures, you are *willfully submitting* to the measures, in order to have access to the venue (in this case the boarding gates.)  No one is pulling you off of the street, you are making the decision to enter an airport.  This is a very important distinction.

To be clear, I don't have a problem with people disliking these ""full-body"" scans, and I think the debate should exist.  My contention is when this debate is framed in terms of ""invasion of privacy"", because it simply doesn't apply.  If you don't like taking off your shoes or having your bag searched, you don't have to go to the airport.  One needs to decide for themselves if the convenience of air travel is worth the hassle.","1262307351"

OK - here's my question: I've always wondered why white folks in the US didn't give the Red Lake high school massacre any attention (especially compared to Columbine or Virginia Tech). I know Red Lake is quite a ways from Gallup, but I thought you might have some insight. What was it like around Gallup when the Red lake high school shoot-up happened?

And apologies for such a general question involving Native Americans and whites. It's just always been on my mind.

Thanks!","1262307521"

I believe that this 1% or so is motivated by more than a desire to even things out. I'm pretty sure they are sociopathic and have attained a high level of power because of how society can inadvertently reward such behavior.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;What is the point of the Pauline epistles? Is their point to explain and exhort the earthly ministry of Jesus? Or is their point more to encourage, rebuke, teach and correct those who are already walking in the faith?

You are creating a false dichotomy. Scripture can do all of these things simultaneously. The gospels, for example, explain and exhort the earthly ministry of Jesus while simultaneously encouraging, rebuking, teaching and correcting those who are already walking in the faith. The Pauline epistles could have done the same.

&gt;Simply because Paul's writings are most likely the earliest, doesn't mean the gospel account wasn't already known, just not necessarily codified.

If the gospel was not yet codified then who was, as you said, ""explaining and exhorting the earthly ministry of Jesus""?
If the gospel was not yet codified then how can we assume that Paul was, as you said, ""building on an already established foundation""? 

And remember that Paul was teaching in cities hundreds of miles from Jerusalem. There was no mass communication back then and the literacy rate was abysmal. Information traveled very slowly. Paul had every reason to share biographical details of the life of Jesus of Nazareth, assuming he knew any details.

If you're for some reason skeptical about what he's said, then all you need to do is tell the FBI or what ever bunch of guys are doing an ""investigation"" that all they need to do is PRODUCE THE FOOTAGE FROM THE AIRPORT.

Its pretty simple don't you think?  He was there, he saw the guy and this ""sharp dressed"" pally must have got the guy on the flight.  Camera footage will show that!

Each report is about 20 pages long, and describes the child, the concerns, the test results, their strengths and weaknesses, my impressions, and my recommendations. I also return phone calls and email from parents and other professionals on my writing days. Occasionally I do school observations or attend school meeting on those days. Some writing days I spend answering AMAs on reddit.  Does that help make it clearer? 

As for your second point, I will admit that I've never thought of that before. I don't know, although I like the idea. ","1262307820"

I adopted classical music on the theory that if it can stimulate brain growth in infants, it might be able to help me rewire my screwed up circuits.  That was literally all I listened to for 3 or 4 years, and I now have a profound love of classical music.

Thankfully, I never got busted for meth.  Now, I am fully functional mentally, and my emotional side is making a strong comeback.  I still have problems with my libido, but that's slowly coming back as well.

In many nations more and more citizens are in favour of legalizing, regulating and taxing recreational substances, just as is done with alcohol. No country is going to be able to do that easily because of all the various treaties the war on drugs has created (as well as the pressure any country trying such things would get from the USA, where too many people are making too much money from the prohibition industry).

Decriminalization is simply a step in the right direction. As more and more countries start to follow suit, people will see that treating drugs as a social issue is far better than as a criminal issue.

I'm oversimplifying all this, but I think this sort of thing has to be viewed as a stepping stone, not a panacea. In that light, it's a good thing. A very good thing indeed.","1262308013"

&gt;The town I was in also helped.

Yes.  What I heard again and again (while swilling booze with street denizens) was that people would hear about the land of free money and food, and immediately trek to SC for the party. I had a good friend who worked for the city managing the homeless services.  She quit and never went back to that sector.  According to her, most of the homeless in SC had no interest in cleaning up.  As you say, the freedom was too intoxicating.  More so, there was a sense of endless, rude entitlement that she found disgusting.  It's interesting that such a deeply liberal, good-hearted person would get so poisoned by simply trying to help others.    

I guess I wonder if you would've taken it so far were SC not a paradise of social-services and free food.  I'd never suggest cutting off all services, but I think past a certain point, that shit becomes enabling and borderline dangerous.   I don't know where it's at now, but it was a fucking mecca for homeless, loafer druggies 1998-2002.  I think I know why.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Being tired or taking longer doesn't change the result that *you are at your friend's house*.  Much like the discussion we're having, whether it matters depends greatly on what specific result you're discussing.

&gt; Language exists for conversational purposes. If you distinctions (which aren't distinctions) provided value then there would be value in regular conversation.

Language exists to convey meaning.  This is usually done in a conversational setting, but I can also be a shouted epithet, jibberish, song, etcetera.  Simply because you don't care about the distinctions I'm making doesn't mean that there aren't distinctions.  It's okay not to care, most folks don't.  This is similar to medical discussions.  Many folks would refer to the stuff that covers our body as ""skin"", but a dermatologist would have specific terms for the layers of skin, the types of skin and a vast repertoire of adjectives to describe conditions of the skin that would never ever be used in a casual conversation.

&gt; The point is that anyone who identifies as an Agnostic doesn't understand the definitions or is one of those crazy irrational exact 50% people who doesn't understand logic or reason.

Many folks that come here claiming agnosticism do not understand the definitions.  I'm not sure where you got your 50% figure from but I'd like to state the opinion that they may not understand logic or reason *in a religious context*.  Most religion is indoctrinated, and part of that indoctrination involves teaching children to compartmentalize their beliefs, placing religion in a special category that doesn't require logic or reason.  Simply having religious beliefs doesn't automatically mean that a person is incapable of applying logic and reason, just that they refuse to apply them to religion.

It's also worth mentioning that agnosticism is one of the common transition states of folks that were religious and are moving towards atheism.  Don't knock the agnostics too much, just encourage them to question their religious beliefs.","1262308088"

Going cold turkey is asking for it. Do you want to be a cartoonist or a painter, or an animator, illustrator, designer? Whatever kind of drawing you do will be linked to your interests. Perspective is very, very useful for almost all types of drawing, but relying on it is as much a trap as ignoring it. No matter what, you need to make an effort and sacrifice to improve.

You can avoid these books if you want (how useful they are is entirely dependent on where you are as an artist; if they work, they work, if they don't, they don't), but if not these, try to read about artists and their methods, and absorb different kinds of art. It can keep you inspired and push you to try different things. I found the above link very useful. I've also read some treatises on Chinese landscape painting and the surrealist manifesto. There's a lot of poets, musicians and philosophers out there that can help you form ideas, and the rest is merely follow through, patience and hard work.

Go to a museum and wander through the different sections, go through your library's art section, watch movies and cartoons, read novels and comics and try to be aware of the human hand and eye in all these things. And talk to people about what you make or want to make, even if what they say makes you cringe. Who do you want to listen to? Your grandma, or an art professor, or your whole generation, or the next one? Or just yourself?

Not all of it will be immediately useful to you, and a lot of the time it may seem like a waste, but it will help you improve and understand what you want from your drawing, even if it ends up meaning you don't want to draw at all.","1262308109"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Many of my family members are members of Radha Soami Satsang. I am not a member myself, and don't know a tremendous amount about it, but as far as I know, it is not a cult, unless you consider the entire Hindu religion to be a cult. 

Radha Soami is basically a guru, or spiritual teacher, who combines teachings from certain streams of Hinduism with teachings from Sikhism. I have spoken with my family members about what they do when they attend the satsang, and the activities seem to be meditation, yoga, devotional singing, and social service. I have never heard anything about hallucinations or extreme mystical experiences, just regular run-of-the-mill meditation. Among Hindus, it's taken as a given that meditation is one tool that can aid someone on the path to enlightenment, and my relatives have never indicated that there's anything about RSSB meditation that makes it special, or different from any other kind of meditation. It should also be noted that a guru is often regarded as an embodiment of God, partially because in Hinduism EVERYONE is an embodiment of God, and partially because the guru's role is considered so crucial in the spiritual path.

For my relatives, the satsang has definitely been a positive influence - it gives them a venue to practice meditation (which is much easier to do in a guided/group setting than on your own) and has gotten many of them to explore spiritual and philosophical ideas and literature which has changed their lives tremendously. None of them have made exorbitant donations to the satsang, and since we are Indian, it's not such a big deal to visit the satsang.

In your mom's case, there is certainly an issue of balance if she is taking trips she cannot afford. There is a possibility that her perspective on the satsang is skewed, which I have seen many times with Westerners coming to Eastern philosophy with a lot of enthusiasm but not a lot of patience to properly understand the philosophy. Radha Soami is definitely stricter about vegetarianism than most Hindu streams, but that's not a big deal if she's careful about maintaining her nutrition and could even be beneficial. 

It is possible that your mother has some issues of perspective and understanding with regards to the RSSB, but it is also possible that you are over-reacting. Maybe both. Either way, I do urge you to read my comments, ask me any questions you like, and realize that ideas that may seem strange to you, even ""cultish,"" are considered normal and even beneficial in other cultures.","1262308216"

&gt;than just being bad in the sack.

Yes but even if a couple of bad lays won't kill you I think a more informed and nuanced view on sex would benefit both women and men. For example, some men would probably be less frustrated about not being able to give their woman sex by penetration alone if they knew most women actually can't come from penetration alone.

&gt;Learning about sex from porn is like learning about forensic science from CSI

Most people don't do forensic science as a part of their everyday routine so I'm not convinced thats a good comparison. But I agree people know the difference between fiction and reality and that there is no direct causation from watching to doing. Still, if most of what you know about something is fantasy you may get in trouble when approaching the task ""for real"".

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","What always amazes me about this issue is that the arguments change drastically whenever the evidence of prior predictions do not come to pass. I've been hearing them for 40 years.

I'm old enough to remember the prediction of the mine ""ice age"" that was first predicted in the 70's. I live in Georgia. We were supposed to start having winters like the north does by the early 80's. It didn't happen.

Then the prediction changed to global warming. The temps absolutely started cooling. 

Global Climatic Change? A safer phrase now used by those who believe in the nonsense and now anything at all that departs from the norm related to weather is completely covered, or so they say anyway. Chicken Little was never guilty of predicting so much gloom and doom.

Knock the old man all you want. Demean his credentials. It's all anyone can do to attempt to discredit common sense. What one cannot do is to refute the simplistic and amazingly truthful science he offers that is outlined in that 8 minute video.

I dumped the incandescent light bulbs. I drive a car that achieves 35 mpg. I take advantage of common sense technology that is proven to save me money. What I will not do is to be victim of this insane guilt trip that people lay on me from time to time if I don't buy into the United Nations intent to redistribute the wealth of the world into a few select pockets, like Al Gore for instance.

Fossil fuels are not destroying the planet. There is not a soul on earth who can convince me otherwise.

Another fun temperament factoid is the [""lemon juice test""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/personalityandindividuality/lemons.shtml) - introverts seem to ""react"" more to stimuli, such as producing more saliva in response to lemon juice placed on the tongue.

"science","t5_mouw","As an aside, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn made a very interesting observation.  

While the US could offer its scientists lots of money, the Soviet Union could not do so.  

So instead of offering them wealth, it took away what they had, leaving them with nothing.  Then, if they discovered or invented things that were useful, they would get modest rewards, like an extra potato with lunch, or an extra blanket.

However, over time, this resulted in an interesting phenomenon.  American scientists spent their time on technology, because ""that was where the money is"", and Soviet scientists spent their time on basic research, because success was determined by their boss, not the market.  This is not to say that one system was better than the other, just different.

But this does point out *how* scientists should be directed, depending on the outcome of their efforts.  If their outcome is technology, they need to be motivated by the market.  If it is pure science, they need to be motivated in other ways.

Importantly, in the former case, universities, foundations, and corporations all demand patent rights from scientific discoveries and inventions.  This works counter to the technological motivation of personal enrichment.  And in the latter case, when credit for invention is taken away by a supervisor, or credit is diluted in publication, it works counter to their alternative motivation.","1262308438"

What's the biggest Vietnam protest? Biggest I could find:

&gt; The Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam demonstrations took place on October 15, 1969. Millions of Americans took the day off from work and school to participate in local demonstrations against the war. These were the first major demonstrations against the Nixon administration's handling of the war. On November 15, 1969 crowds estimated up to half a million people participated in an anti-war demonstration in Washington, D.C. and a similar demonstration was held in San Francisco. These protests were organized by the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (New Mobe) and the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (SMC).

There didn't seem to be anything particularly weird about it, as someone not coming from a windows/linux/dos assembly background. The complaints seem mostly to be ""this isn't what I'm used to"". The complaint that *my 64-bit OS running on a 64-bit CPU expects 64-bit code by default* is particularly funny. (Mac OS X 10.6 on an x86_64 defaults to a 32-bit kernel and 64-bit userland).

tl;dr: if you want to learn the conventions of a particular platform, you need to learn on that platform. For learning 386 in general, the Mac seems fine to me.","1262308473"

"politics","t5_2cneq","It will be a catastrophic disaster if humans reach singularity before we develop the emotional, intellectual and cultural maturity to deal with such power.

The nature of human beings is to seek power and control first and then worry about using it wisely later. In our primitive minds, there is no problem until there is an actual tangible example of that problem. For instance, global warming was denied by most until the weather patterns began to change. Dealing with the consequences post-hoc is fine when your most powerful tool is a club, or a rifle. Its not good enough when it gets to things like WMDs, or worse, molecular control of matter and genetic control of life.

There is a real possibility that the reason we have never detected intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is that when it evolves enough intelligence, just like us it seeks power and control faster than it seeks the maturity to use such power wisely, and thus exterminates itself almost as soon as it develops a technology powerful enough to do so.

It isn't at all comforting that humans haven't wiped ourselves out in the couple of generations we have had the power to do so because a few generations is nothing, and its debatable whether we really do have such all-encompassing power just yet. The debate is over when we reach the singularity.","1262308475"

It may be that seeing the world in those terms isn't a bad thing.  It's just your particular filter that colours your worldview.  We all have our filters.

I will say by way of encouragement that the people I am closest to tend to have had rough childhoods, on par with yours.  It confounds me how such shitty parenting can produce such wonderful adults, who make for such great allies.

She says the thing most people don't understand is that when you draw attention to an abusive parent, that parent's just going to go home and beat the hell out of their kid even more.

Understand that when you do call CPS, if the parent *is* abusive and the cops *can't* find any evidence, then that kid's probably in for a world of hurt.

Because we only get together a few times a year, we make the most of it, being a family, talking, playing sports, etc. So I guess that answers your first question, too.","1262308769"

You're right in that karma is almost-worthless.  It's at best a game, and at worst a simple reputation metric.  The only use we currently have for karma is that it plays a role in whether or not the rater-limiter applies.

3) Rename the .kde4 directory that contains all KDE specific settings and configuration to some other name. The command would look something like this; mv .kde4 kde4backup
4) You may logout at the virtual console now. Switch to the login screen (Ctrl+Alt+F7) and login.

You should start with defaults restored. As you gain more experience, you'll be able to pinpoint the source of the trouble. Typically, look in .kde4/share/config for the rc file and .kde4/share/apps for the directory containing the application's files.

"reddit.com","t5_6","This is a good opportunity, it seems to me, to solicit a redress of a grievance that I have with one of the most fundamental features of Reddit, the karma system.

Presumably, its raison d'être is the improvement of the quality of discussion.  The thinking was, or so I infer, that those whose comments and submissions improved the community best would be rewarded with numerical indices of their merit - indices whose power to reward lay within their ability to interest fellow redditors in approaching the person's comment with a willingness to credit and in their ability to increase the rate with which they might comment.  The other motive, of course, behind its establishment was to turn everyone into a moderator who, working in tandem, could hide spam so readily that no spammer would even think to spam in the first place.  Unfortunately, the karma system has largely failed to achieve its purpose (or hasn't achieved nearly so much success as certain alternatives would) and has for the following reasons:

* Upvotes beget upvotes, and downvotes downvotes.  Cf.  [Argumentum ad populum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum), [halo effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) (karma system merely aggravates this; it isn't wholly responsible for it), [social proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof), [herd behavour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_behavior), [peer pressure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure), [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).  People look more to a comment's rating than its content when deciding what to do with the comment.

* Redditors, in pursuit of this intangible prize of karma, make cheap appeals to peoples' senses of humor and forgone conclusions - i.e. demagoguery - in order to get as many karma points as possible. (Karma whoring).  The vast majority of threads are filled with dozens upon dozens of five to ten word comments upvoted to the top of the discussion despite that they almost invariably say nothing insightful, thoughtful, intelligent, meaningful, novel, creative, actionable, or useful.

*  Related to the preceding point, we suffer here on Reddit from the tyranny of the majority.  This is fine if the majority are people of great discretion and perspicacity, but they aren't.  This place is certainly democratic (yay 'fairness'!), but if we assume most people are ignorant/wrong as to most things, then in the mean the wrong has the most prominent position in any given thread and the right the least (if it's visible at all).  So the effect is only the reinforcement of false and stupid beliefs and the reinforcement of the reader's repudiation of alternative, possibly more correct ideas.

* Hit-and-run downvoting/upvoting.  Rather than respond to a comment with an attempt at an explanation as to why it were wrong or right, people just downvote/upvote and scurry off.  This wouldn't really be a problem if comments weren't hidden when excessively downvoted and people could dispassionately analyze the content of a comment without letting the comment's karma score influence their appraisal.

The karma system discourages debate; it discourages people from reevaluating their beliefs; it discourages people from giving others the benefit of the doubt; it encourages people to post inane crap; etc...

It's Reddit's answer to the sitcom laugh track.  ""Hey everybody!  Laugh!  This is funny!  See!  Everyone else is laughing so you should, too.  You wouldn't want to be *different* or an *outcast* would you?""


I recommend a system in which karma is invisible; every comment starts with 15 or 20 karma points and is only hidden when it reaches zero; the downvote button is replaced with a ""report as spam"" button"", and there exists no equivalent of an upvote button; the definition of ""spam"" is expanded to include inane, useless, and/or unacceptably truculent comments; those who report a comment as spam have themselves added to an expandable list attached to the hidden comment, with their usernames hidden ideally, so that they, too, may be reported if they're found to be abusing the system to hide things that they simply disagree with or dislike for whatever reason.

I'm sorry, but if there were actually a ""truth in politics"" panel, they would  be spending nearly all their time on Reddit explaining that ""corporatism"" does not mean ""big corporations run everything.""

Corporatism is as system where the various corporate bodies in a nation (religious, agricultural, business, education, labor, etc.) are required to work together to achieve goals inline with national interests.  This is a far cry from the economic system in the US (supported by both parties) where corporate bodies are legally required to remain independent, and cooperation is strictly limited via contract, collusion, trust, and monopoly laws.

Fascists support the unification of the proletariat, and while tolerant of small business, generally opposed large corporations.  Fascists also promoted the state-run industry, and non-state run industry only in a strictly corporatist model.

Fascists were/are staunch opponents of ""supercaptialism"" or ""decadent capitalism"" which they believed led to wasting resources.

The wittiness of the writing was superb, though. There were so many quips and side jokes - It was hilarious.  Sometimes they mumbled, which I honestly didn't like, but overall the actors were phenomenal. 

It could have had less fighting and explosions, but I suppose it was marketed more as an action flick, than a historical fiction type movie. 
One thing I didn't particularly enjoy (or just found awkward), is that Downey defiantly looks his age (44), and his love interest can pass for her late 20's. They could have casted a woman who was older, or at least LOOKED older. It would have been much more believable, seeing as she's the only one who can ""outsmart"" Holmes. 

Also, I saw it in a directors hall with beautiful (and comfortable - no numb-ass here) leather seats, so I might be biased. :D","1262309059"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; Jesus is God's Wisdom in human form. The divinity is never in question

Hmm.. 

How do you explain then why John carefully chose to remind the readers again and again of the following verses which clearly make Jesus out to be a lesser authority than God, and as simply a messenger from God who teaches Gods thoughts **not** his own.

John 5:19 ""The Son can not do a single thing of his own initiative""

John 5:30 ""I can not do a single thing of my own initiative""

John 7:28 ""I have not come of my own initiative, but he that sent me is real and you do not know him.""

John 8:28 ""I do nothing of my own initiative, just as the father taught me I speak these things""

John 8:42 ""Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that one sent me forth""

.

John 14:28 ""The father is greater than I am""

.

John explains perfectly clear exactly what purpose and what idea he wished people to learn about Jesus in his conclusion:

John 20:31 ""But these have been written down that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God""

He could have said ""so that you may believe that Jesus is God Almighty"" but he didn't.

Yet that is exactly what you claim John wanted us to believe.

Instead I believe that John wanted people to know clearly that Jesus not just metaphorically the son of God Almighty the same way other humans could be called sons of God, but that Jesus was different he was LITERALLY the Son of God Almighty, this by extension would naturally also make Jesus himself a divine one or god who should be respected.

But he was never made equal to God Almighty, Almighty God was always higher just as a father is higher than a son.

After his resurrection Jesus himself said ""I am ascending to my father and to your father, to my God and your God."" (John 20:17) showing that Jesus worships and prays to the same God that his disciples should worship and pray to, not himself, someone else: God Almighty.

I think it used to be that as common sense advanced amongst a populace, it would be absurd for a politician to do something other than the obvious. That's no longer the case though, as there is a disconnect between what the public think and what the government does.

Actually I wouldn't mind that so much in the case of say a stealth group of individuals designing the core definitions that drive how all the various subsystems work. The populace would have to implicitly trust this process. If that actually happened we would see certain institutions dismantled as unnecessary, but what's going on is an attempt to preserve every last bit of society. Very disturbing.

**Him:** Yep. Bush was in office for 9 months and 9/11 was all his fault. Obama is in office for a whole year and the Underwear Bomber is ... Bush's fault. Of course. LOL!!! Also, the Democrats used every single problem that happened during the Bush administration from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina to attack President Bush. That's politics and politics ain't beanbag. So Maddow can save the phony outrage over Republicans pointing out Obama's weak response to a terrorist attack because the Dems have done it all before. Maybe instead of getting all weepy and indignant now that their guy is in office, the Democrats should grow a pair.
2 hours ago · 



**Me:** Was anything in her video untrue? Or like last time (John Birch Society) you're not refuting any of the facts in her clip about those Republicans hypocrisies, but just criticizing her for exposing them?

Her uppity demeanor annoys me too, but I am finding she has a knack for something I am also very fond of; cutting through the bullshit and calling a spade a spade.
about an hour ago · 



**Him:** Nope, to my knowledge, only one thing in her video appears untrue. It's where she flat-out accuses Bush for 9/11 when it's common knowledge that 9/11 was in the planning and preparation stages while Clinton was president. Plenty of blame to go around on that one, unless your motives are less than the truth. 

This report is just faux outrage and is every bit as political as what she's criticizing Republicans for. I'm sure she and her ilk were saying similar things about President Bush when he was in office. 

Also, it's very telling that she blames Bush for intelligence failures when Obama has been in office for almost a year. That exposes her for the partisan political hack that I've been telling you that she is. The fact of the matter is this: This was a catastrophic intelligence failure under Obama's watch. She can't smugly say that ""9/11 happened under Bush's watch"" while totally excusing the exact same failure under Obama's watch. You can't have it both ways and call yourself honest and ""truth-seeking"".

So, she wasn't actually ""cutting through the bullshit"", so much as creating a new layer of bullshit with her own hypocrisy and distorted ""facts"".

At the end of the day, this will not change any minds. Obama is already perceived, with good reason, as a weak, indecisive leader. The damage ia already done by his, and especially Janet Napolitano's, weak responses to the terrorist attack and no amount of MSNBC Obama-slobbering spin will change that.

"science","t5_mouw","You are misusing the term ""vaporware"".  Vaporware is something that a company promises to a client that hasn't been built yet.  There is no one promising LFTRs yet.  Everyone admits that they are an untested technology.

And the argument ""if they really worked they would have been built already"" is obviously wrong.  If this really held up there would never be any technological progress.  By your logic everything possible has already been done.

The same economies of scale and technology upgrades that you cite as factors for current technologies would apply to LFTRs as well.  They could go through the same iterative improvements that you see in any new technology.

The problem with the LFTR is not some insurmountable technical problem that everyone is hiding from the public in some sort of conspiracy.  It is simply that there is no regulatory environment for them, no tax benefits for them, there has been no Manhattan Project for them, and the current generation of nuclear physicists has spent no time working with them.  In a talk about them I heard one physicist say that in his entire time getting his masters and PhD he heard about the thorium cycle and the earlier work surrounding it for 15 minutes in a single class.","1262309260"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm going to tell you about when I had to have my best friend put to sleep like July 9th. Cavu was my yellow lab and the best friend I ever had.

I knew that she was getting older and sicker, but as long as she was still enjoying her life and wagging her tail - I couldn't imagine making that decision to end her life. Then last July 6th, I realized that Cavu hadn't eaten the entire day - the next day passed: I cooked her chicken and shrimp, and she couldn't/wouldn't eat. We took her to the vet and I paid $500.00 for x-rays because I had to know.

Cavu had a huge tumor that was compressing her windpipe, removing it would mean opening up her chest - and it was just too big. We had to decide if we were so selfish to watch her starve to death, or put her on IV's...I had to make that decision that day. It was the hardest thing I've had to do. But she wasn't happy, she was starving, and sick and old. So I kissed her nose and told her I loved her - and watched her die.

Maybe, just maybe, your wife didn't want you to have to experience that. Maybe she just wanted the suffering to be over. Maybe your wife loves you and wants to protect you. 

Sorry this is so long. But I think about Cavu everyday, she gave me 13 very happy years - but dogs die. I'm sorry, but it's true.","1262309303"

If I see someone who has been here a year or so with very low karma, my first thought is that it's an alternate account used to say what the person really thinks ( not necessarily bad things) or that it's a troll account.

Fair or not, the last thing I consider is that it's really someone who has had an account here for a while and rarely participates.   But this can usually be ascertained once you start reading old comments within their overview and see that they are, indeed, quite sincere.

Then you come across the 'power players', who need no explanation.

In the end, karma points can serve to reveal something about the personality with whom you are dealing.  Otherwise, we might as well be on a site exchanging thoughts and ideas in almost complete darkness.

It can be disheartening when those throwing out a couple of clever words make over 900 points verses those who gave real time, consideration, and thought to the same question might receive 2, if that.  But that's the nature of the beast.  And, to my way of thinking, *that's* where not allowing yourself to care too much about karma points comes in to play.  

Although, pathetically enough ;), discovering that one of your comments has suddenly been swamped with karma points can raise your spirits and make you feel pretty darn good.  That, too, is the nature of the beast.

In the end, I like the karma points and tend to miss them when reading comments on other sites.  It begins to feel as though the other sites' comments portion is somehow incomplete.","1262309315"

In your case, obviously it isn't debilitating; however, you surely understand that there are some people who suffer much more deeply than you or I.  Several of my acquaintances suffer severe depression, and one in particular has become even more of a recluse than I--not having left her home in several years, for fear of public humilation(I surmize.)

That's a pretty reasonable record.

Guantanamo has been a controversial 'in the works' for months.  While I don't stand by Guantanamo either way, we are technically at war...  PoW's, enemy combatants, or legal chattel do, in fact, have to be kept somewhere or shot.  Well, they're not being shot...  that's a plus, right?  Guantanamo is, in my opinion, less of an evil Dachau camp hidden away in Cuba, and more of a prison which is the result of international NIMBY-ism when it comes to political prisoners of terror.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sorry to hear about your loss. 

It is understandable that you are angry. Keep in mind, that anger is the second stage of grief.

If I had to throw out a guess, I'd wager that your wife has been feeling disrespected for a long time. I can imagine that being forced to clean up copious shit and vomit, while watching a dying animal suffer, would be very stressful.

You are expecting her to take your feelings into consideration, although you obviously haven't given much regard to hers. Perhaps she plotted to have your dog put down when you were at work, because she was at her breaking point and knew that you would expect her to continue doing something that she found extremely unpleasant. Perhaps she panicked and couldn't figure out how to deal with it. Maybe she knew it was inevitable and didn't want to ruin your day when there was nothing you could do. If you don't feel like she deserves the benefit of the doubt, then there is a big underlying problem.

If she is lying about the reason she did this, then shame on her. I would have to wonder why she felt that she needed to handle it that way? Are you a tyrant who imposes your will upon her and keeps her in fear of making a ""wrong"" decision? Or is she a back-stabbing manipulator who chooses the easy way out to avoid dealing with things in a mature fashion? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in-between?

Based on the information you have given, I would be inclined to say that you are both at fault for not taking each others feelings into consideration. If you treated her with respect, you would not have asked her to deal with the dying dog. And if she treated you with respect, she would have stood up to you and refused to do it anymore.

If your relationship is in such a state that this makes you want to divorce her, then perhaps you should. The issue appears to go much deeper than what happened today; and if your love for her is not great enough to overcome this event, then the future doesn't look very positive. At the very least, you should seriously consider finding someone to help the two of you sort through the anger that you are both harboring.","1262309452"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Childhood neglect causes, basically, brain damage. 

Think about how children learn about cause-and-effect - they have a need (hunger; discomfort; affection), express that need, and the caregiver responds. The infant or young child is able to easily grasp the relationship between their need, their behavior, and getting a response. As children get older, they learn from their caregivers' responses when to become upset, how upset to become, and how they can begin calming themselves - this is basically teaching them how to express and modulate their emotions. 

If a child's caregiver responds to her unpredictably, or not at all, the child either does not learn these lessons, or learns the wrong things. They may have trouble thinking about how their actions affect others, or know how to get the ""right"" amount upset, or how to calm themselves, or what to get upset over. They may expect people to ignore them, or hurt them, or punish them, or not do anything unless they seriously overreact. Or they may not even know what they expect. 

Disorders that can be associated with childhood neglect include Reactive Attachment Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, various mood disorders, and ADHD, among others. Some severely neglected children may also show cognitive deficits. Often, the cognitive deficits can be remediated in the right environment, but the emotional deficits can unfortunately have lifelong effects. ","1262309505"

Change doesn't happen immediately. Humans evolved these characteristics you dislike over millions of years. In the grand scheme of evolution, the enlightenment is happening at lightning speeds. 

&gt;It will be impossible to preserve our planet in anything approaching it's natural state without a major population collapse of not only humans but all of those other animals that we are in conflict with over resources.

What is the ""natural state"" of the planet? It started off as a big ball of lifeless rock. It wasn't until early life transformed the planet into an oxygen-rich green world. There were many extinction events that shaped life further. Now, a once insignificant line of creatures known as mammals have developed technology and things are changing again. Maybe it will be an extinction event. Maybe it is something new like another Cambrian explosion and an entirely new form of life (e.g. technology) is developing. Human technology is just as natural as anything else that exists.

My overall point is that you are pessimistic looking at the short term. If you look at the long term trends (not even the evolutionary trends, but just the human trends you will see in your lifetime), things aren't so bad.","1262309534"

Is it common that young girls expect you to bite them during sex because most images of sex they've encountered involved vampires?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","yes, i'm currently taking anti-depressants. why? because i have major depression. 

what kind? first, i tried Prozac. after a week of taking it, i started to experience some pretty bad side-effects, mostly anxiety. it was the most intense anxiety i've ever experienced. i would wake up every morning having an anxiety attack. sweating, heart racing, stomach ache, unable to stay still, fearful of getting out of bed or leaving my house... it was awful.

then, i started on Cipralex/Escitalopram and immediately discontinued the Prozac. within the first week i started feeling better, started feeling my mood improving. the side effects were much more manageable. drowsiness, dry mouth, involuntary twitches. over a year later, i still get the dry mouth and twitches, but not the drowsiness.

eventually, i felt the Cipralex wasn't working as well for me as it used to. my doctor started me on Wellbutrin. the twitches got way worse, to the point where my whole body was shaking constantly. especially my hands and feet. i'm an artist, and i treasure my find motor skills, so this really sucked. it made every day tasks difficult. it also made my heart race and my blood pressure higher. i began this strange compulsion of checking my blood pressure several times every day. as soon as i stopped taking the Wellbutrin, i stopped checking my blood pressure.

now i'm just on 20mg of Cipralex daily. on bad days, i take 40mg and i feel very indifferent to the world.  i haven't yet tried to discontinue taking anti-depressants yet, but i do hope to be medication free one day. i have a history of suicide in my family, so i would rather have to take a pill every day than risk offing myself.","1262309666"

To me, though, having long abandoned belief in an afterlife and having witnessed death, I've come to see death as being a peaceful thing, something akin to just falling asleep for good.

As for *life* I feel like it's such an amazing, chance opportunity that I have a consciousness here among all of these other life forms floating on a speck of dust in the middle of an unfathomably huge space.  That idea may not be as appealing to everyone as it is me, but gaining that bigger perspective on what life is and how, in spite of how difficult and unanswered it may be, lucky I am to be here to be a part of it is both awe-inspiring and comforting in a way.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Years ago varmiters took the most inherently accurate case design the 308 Win and paired it with the bullet with the best bullet ballistic coefficient and got the 7mm-08.  It's a shorter action than the 270 and recoil isn't bad at all. People who have them love them.  That said, I have a 308 that does fine.   The very most important thing is to be able to accurately place your shots.  A couple of guys up the road were arguing about the merits of a 30-30 and decided to hold a 300 yard target shoot-off.  The one fello brought out his .270 and the match was on......seems the 30-30 guy won.   It's all about good trigger pull, not flinching and acquaintance with the firearm.  
For a scope I would get the newer heavy circle reticle - it is getting very popular because it naturally centers your target much like the old peep-sight does letting you acquire a kill-shot situation under very fast-moving conditions.  
With almost any caliber suggested here you can sight your rifle in at 25 yards and shoot point-blank out to 300 yards and make clean kills on deer sized animals and 300 yards is very a long shot unless you are proficient; most once-a-year hunters can barely hit a garbage can lid at 100 yards offhand.  
   
BTW the 270 is a very good choice too.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;You are creating a false dichotomy. Scripture can do all of these things simultaneously. The gospels, for example, explain and exhort the earthly ministry of Jesus while simultaneously encouraging, rebuking, teaching and correcting those who are already walking in the faith. The Pauline epistles could have done the same.

You're treating scripture in a way you would not treat any other written material.  If I write you a letter, and I don't mention your mom &amp; dad, I'm not implying that you were hatched, adopted, or fell from outer space, but rather, my letter is addressing other issues.  Paul sat down and wrote a letter to the churches in Galatia, Corinth, Rome, etc.  These were people who were already believers (that's why he addresses them to the 'Saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae'.)  His point was ""How you are acting is not how Jesus would want you to act.

If Paul was writing letters to the 'Agnostics and athiests of Rome' then maybe he would have dealt more with the earthly life of Jesus.

&gt;If the gospel was not yet codified then who was, as you said, ""explaining and exhorting the earthly ministry of Jesus""?

Again, not having it codified doesn't mean nobody knew it.  In 1st century AD, it was common to pass along information verbally.  Especially among the Jewish people.  So men were proclaiming the gospel that later got written down so that it could be preserved.  So, in Galatians, when Paul says ""preaching to you another gospel, which really isn't a gospel"" this is what he's referring to. Additionally, it's likely that by the time of the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) that not all the gospels (if any) had been written.  Yet these men were able to proclaim what it meant to be a Christian.  They had an understanding, from being told the gospel.

Finally, and I'm not sure why I didn't think of this before, but Acts 17 especially v3 seems to indicate that Paul spoke of an earthly Jesus.  Unless he's telling the Jewish leaders that ""this Jesus I am proclaiming"" suffered spiritually and rose from the dead spirtually.","1262309720"

Allow me to elucidate.

I just purchased a new laptop, that came bundled with MS Office 2007, or whatever the most recent iteration is.   It was a 60 day trial software package.   Cool!  I teach High School courses online, and most of my kids submit in MS format, and occasionally there are formatting differences- now I can see the assignments how they were meant to be seen, and try out MS Office for myself.

Third assignment in, I read something that appears plagiarized (not uncommon).   I highlight a phrase, ctrl-c, and ctrl-v it into Google with quotation marks around it.  Hmmm... That wasn't the phrase- it was a previous word I had copied from earlier in the day.  I try it again, but to no avail.  I look more closely, and grayed out at the top, it says that copy-paste functionality is disabled in the trial version of MS Office.  

Read that again: **COPY-PASTE FUNCTIONALITY IS DISABLED IN THE TRIAL VERSION OF MS OFFICE**  It's a time-limited trial already! WTF?!

It's like I go to test drive a new car, and the guy tells me that the turn signals, and top two gears are disabled for the test drive, but don't worry- they'll enabled them when I purchase the car.

Fuck Microsoft.  Open Office all the way- I recommend it to all my students now.

TL;DR: Bought a laptop with a 60-day time limited trial of MS Office, Copy-Paste was disabled, was pissed off at Microsoft.

Edit: all sorts of other things were disabled as well, but I didn't stay long enough to find out what.

For a western world atheist to live in fear of being ""lynched"" today is a tad hysterical, in the very same manner that American christians are mildly hysterical in talking of how they are persecuted. 

As for Stalin and Mao's reasons for doing what they did, I do not disagree with you. The reason for Stalin and Mao's actions is not relevant to this discussion. I was pointing out, again, the similarity between hysterical atheists and hysterical christians. For an atheist to say ""it could happen here"" because of something that happened in the dark ages is akin to a wild-eyed christian saying ""it could happen here"" with reference to Stalin and Mao. 

Thus, in conclusion, if you believe that, as an atheist, you have a ""serious"" reason for fearing being lynched in front of a church because of something that happened some 800 years ago -- in the dark ages -- then it would be hard to see, logically speaking, how one could deny hysterical christians their ""serious"" fear of the secularist boogeymen taking over and murdering them etctera.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;While it may be true that I intend to raise my hand in 10 years when I also vow to do so.

That's a different kind of ""true"". Genuine vows and promises carry moral value so they're true because they *should be* true. Your prediction about your intentions came true but ""truth"" in this context has less to do with predicting facts about the future but more to do with fulfilling your intentions concerning future events (raising my hand on Christmas next year).

&gt;I think we can avoid your whole intentionality objection by ignoring the existence of mind, momentarily. 

I don't think intentionality requires the existence of a mind. Husserl created phenomenology precisely to address this issue. We can debate whether the mind *exist* but it doesn't impact on our understanding of what intentions are (the directedness quality of our consciousness).

&gt;In fact, it is the result of this experiment that I'm hoping will lead us to postulate the mind as something connected to the brain (in a special way), even if we flat deny its connection, prior.

You're barking up the wrong tree. The mind and body can't be ""connected"" without serious gymnastics of sophistry and it's futile to attempt it, IMO. The works of Heidigger and Husserl (intersubjectivity etc) address these issues directly and you might be interested to delve deeper but I'm not sure if you want this to be the direction of our conversation.

&gt;If you buy this analogy to the brain up to this point, my question is: who or what is the clock-expert for the brain, with whom I must have spoken?

The analogy I understand and the relationship to your original question you're trying to build I can see but your question is flawed because it is based on a few misconceptions about the various concepts of ""truth"" in general.

The truth of future intentions (an issue of authenticity and a trivial account of personal integrity) is not the same type of truth as the truth of predictions concerning future events. Moral truth isn't the same as epistemic truth and I think your reasoning fails to maintain this distinction. Crudely put, you don't know ""dick"" about your brain and just because you kept your word and raised your arm doesn't mean you suddenly have knowledge about the original source of your intentions itself.

It might be interesting to know, Heidigger challenged whether this ""original source of intentions itself"" was coherent. I'm a bit fucked for NYE and I can't remember the term but your ""clock-expert of the brain"" might be similar to Husserl's ""transcendental soul"". Regardless, Heidigger's whole ""Dasien"" thing was a challenge/alternative approach and you might look in this direction if you want to figure it out yourself.","1262309770"

I think that religion is going through a difficult point in history.  They see the unreasonable effectiveness of science, and are trying to adjust their views to a scientifically justifiable basis to cope.  However, as science and religion have completely different views on epistemology, this effort is ultimately futile.  As you say, religion is supposed to be unverifiable.  I think it's because after the schism between Catholicism, and Protestantism, the Bible suddenly had to be literally true, because the continuity of the mother church (and papal infalliability) could no longer be used to justify belief.  Without a central authority, the bible had to be self-justifying, whereas the Catholic church, which compiled the bible, viewed it as partially literal, partially symbolic, and a set of parables to guide people to a better life.  And if the bible is literally true, it must be completely accurate.  ","1262309793"

Apple isn't developing its own proprietary connectors or peripherals and forcing you to use them; it's just not including them at all. Would you complain that your car didn't feature an open architecture if it didn't feature pre-cut holes and wiring for speakers when you bought it without a radio? Apple's not limiting you to, for example, only their upgrades; they're just not letting you upgrade at all. Not, perhaps, great for the consumer, but certainly not a ""closed architecture"". Plus, their all-in-one iMacs, supposedly some locked-down platform, even have upgradeable graphics cards following an industry standard; Apple can't be blamed for the fact that no one wants to make cards that follow said standard.

Apple also doesn't use any proprietary hardware. Anyone could make a compatible clone; they just don't and it's not clear why (Psystar, etc. don't count; those are compatible but use hacks to get OS X up and running--I'm talking about a real clone that uses real EFI, not some hacked BIOS/bootloader). If Apple used proprietary hardware, they wouldn't have felt it necessary to sue Psystar; Psystar's clones wouldn't have worked anyway.

Vendor lock-in? If people didn't insist on buying iPods and music from iTMS, there would be no vendor lock-in. Why are they buying iPods? Why are they purchasing these DRMed songs?

They are of worse quality, cost more, and have DRM. iPods cost more than comparable music players. So why do people insist on using them? No one is forcing them to do so. This is merely an example of really good marketing. They don't have to force anyone to do anything.

Also, ""Son-ness"" is a pretty broad spectrum of relationships. The Hebrew Scriptures are littered with various people who were called sons of God and who walked with God all the days of their lives. It'd be great if you could find the word ""literally"" inserted in that line, but I'm guessing it's not there. I'm not saying it's wrong to believe that, I'm just saying it's not directly from the Bible. 

Saying Jesus is God's Wisdom in human form comes straight from the first chapter of John. I think it's a fitting allegorical device (even if it did actually happen that way) that the first words out of Jesus' mouth are ""what are you looking for?""

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I have read many books on atheism. It is furthermore notable that men like Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris and Dan Dennett do not comport themselves as fanatics -- merely a high-volume percentage of their ""followers"" do. There is a difference between gentle, rational and unsparing / uncompromising discourse on the subject of religion versus fervent foaming at the mouth. 

As for my aversion to fanaticism of all stripes, how can it be a ""misconception"" when the evidence of fanatical (i.e. ""fanboy"") atheism is all over reddit?

To further clarify, I would not consider myself an enemy of the reddit atheist community. I would simply encourage overexcited atheists to improve their game by bringing a little more coolheaded perspective and a little less irrational exuberance into the picture. This does not mean being a shrinking violet. It just means seeing with open eyes and not making a negative belief (the fact that there is no god, or at least no logical evidence for one) into an overhyped substitute for self-worth and personally meaningful life pursuit.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;We need everyone to stop spending more than they earn. That is true not just for individuals, but for our government as well.

I apologize for asking a really stupid question.  Is this even possible in the long run, unless the money supply expands?  Here's how I see it, and I'd appreciate it if someone can explain where I'm making the mistake.  

In order for an individual or firm to earn money, another individual or firm must spend it.  Consider a closed economy with no government and a fixed quantity of money.  In each period of time, the firms initially spends money to produce goods and services.  This money is earned by the households.  The households then spends a portion of the money earned to purchase the products and services, and saves the rest.  This saved money could either be invested such that they're not returned to existing firms, i.e. stuffed under the mattress or held as bank reserves (let's call these ""unproductive"" investments). Alternatively, the saved money could be invested such that the money will be returned to existing firms, i.e. in new businesses that use the money to purchase goods or services from existing businesses (let's call these ""productive"" investments).

Let's consider the extreme where people put all their savings in unproductive investments.  The money saved unproductively is not returned to firms.  This means that firms on average do not make as much as they spent.  Firms must dissave, or pass those dissavings on to households through layoffs.

Let's consider the other extreme where all the money saved is invested such that they're returned to existing businesses.  This requires an increase in the velocity of money, as in people must make and spend money faster than before.  However, there are limits to how fast people can spend their money.  Additionally, the velocity of money is often increased by using debt to spend money before it's earned.  As a result, not only does productive investments not allow everyone to save more than they earn in the long term, it's also highly unstable.  If people decide to spend their money slower or make unproductive investments at some point, firms will not make as much as they spend and thus they dissave.  If they pass those dissavings on to their employees or suppliers, it can result in a deflationary spiral where lower firm earnings make productive investments less desirable, which further reduces velocity and firm earnings.

If this is correct, then the only way the private sector can save is for the government or foreign sector to spend more than it earns.  However, trade surpluses cannot be sustained in the long run due to exchange rates and/or international relations concerns.  So the only way the private sector can save in the long run is for the government to run a deficit.","1262309872"

Racism is horrible, but if it works as a means to prevent more violence, and to save innocent lives, then it might not be such a bad thing, in these conditions.

You can have your TSA security theater, you can take off all your clothes and dispose of all your liquids, you can decide that if the security people *look* like they know what they're doing, then they probably do.
Or you can have the alternative, which is separating the people with backgrounds that are most conducive to terrorist activity and focus on them, because in the end the person most likely to attempt an attack on Israel will still be someone who has visited countries without diplomatic relations with Israel or someone that is a fundamentalist (that includes Jews), rather than a fifty year old Israeli born Jewish Likud member, on whom extensive questioning and additional security checks would be a waste of time that may serve to create the illusion of extra security, but actually just wastes time.

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","I have not read either of those, I am sad to say.  But I have read some books about human biology and nueroscience that make a good case for libertarianism/anarchy.

I contend that libertarianism takes human nature into account very well.  libertarianism is based on the idea (among many others) that people are self interested.  Everyone.  Even politicians.

With all due respect, it is good natured statists who do not take human nature into account.  They believe that as soon as someone begins to work for the government that they somehow lose their self interest.  There is a theory called Public Choice Economics that explains this in detail.  Essentially what it does is apply everything we know about economics to the government.  What we learn is that not only are politicians not concerned about your well being, but that they actively work against it.  

So, what is the difference if government is self interested or businessmen are self interested?  Wouldn't we be screwed either way?

No.  And the answer lies in monopoly.  And no, I don't mean get out of jail free cards.  Governments are a monopoly.  Even countries with the greatest amount of freedom hold monopolies on the use of force.  They are the only institution within a given geographic area that is allowed to decide upon whom to use force, and how much and how often.  

If you don't like your government, you cannot simply cancel your service with them, stop sending them money and choose another organization to provide you with whatever you think it is such an institution should provide.  You have to drastically alter your life by moving.  And even then, you still have to live with the monopolistic government in your new country.  

Businesses on the other hand (as long as they are not propped up by government)  have to compete for your dollar.  They are still self interested and would cheat the hell out of you if they could.  But, it is competition that precludes this from happening because they must convince you to patronize them.  They have to offer a better deal than the other greedy guy which results in a win for the greedy consumer.  Efficiency is increased along with overall wealth while peace is preserved by mutual assured prosperity.

What a ridiculous argument.  You know very well we are talking about a personal God, ie, the God of the Bible or the Qu'ran.  This is the God of religion, and thus the God that I am arguing against.  

&gt;I am sure you have heard the saying ""the proof is in the pudding"" Well if you open your eyes the proof is all around you. Our very existence proves the existence of a Creator.

Laughable argument.  You are basically saying, ""I want to believe in a God, so I am going to pretend that everything is evidence of his existence.""  This is the delusion I am talking about; you are seeing ghosts all around you when no ghost exists.  

&gt;Atheism is a theist of chance and accidents, 

Not only does this statement not even make sense, it reveals your ignorance. 

&gt;but the real universe is complex, specific and of intelligent design. The presence of intelligent design proves the existence of an intelligent designer.

Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. - Matthew 5:18-20

The truth is that Christians often just pick the 'pretty' parts of the bible to quote and claim that the bible is all peaceful and good and then sort of sweep the rest under the rug.

Lol, I did not meant an ethical ought.   That should be obvious form the context.    

&gt;Well, then I'll say that the idea of subjective rationality is pretty much an oxymoron.

Opinion noted.

&gt;To who? You?

If some view empiricism as more important than holding to presupposed facts and/or essentially making things up, and others view to opposite, how can you honestly assert that rational is only objective?

&gt;You don't think Religious experience is a real phenomenon? So all the billions of Religious people are simply lying to themselves about what they feel? Simply put, its "" a subjective experience where an individual reports contact with a transcendent reality, an encounter or union with the divine"" (wikipedia definition)

That depends on the definition of real.    By real, I mean a deity causing physical change of brain state, emotion or affecting physical objects.     I don't doubt that believers _think, have faith in and believe_ that they have magical experiences, I'm simply skeptical it's anything more than cognitive bias towards the person's presuppositions and/or some combination of the brain ""playing tricks.""     There are any numbers of possible explanations that have nothing to do with genuine magical/religious experience, and absolutely 0 evidence that these experiences are any more real than a schizophrenic's.  (Not that I'd liken the religious to the latter.)    

&gt;No.

And you have the gall to object to a link?

Anyway, this discussion is obviously not going to go anywher, so I'm going to bow out now.    Happy New Year.

You can certainly report them to a moderator, but the moderators have lives too. Hence being able to ""kill"" a spam account gives a certain amount of satisfaction via the mechanism that can also hurt you.

You can even get better at something as amorphous as ""thinking creatively"" if you practice it. Think of things that get you thinking outside the box. For instance, one of the neat things about language is its generativity - the way that language works in the brain, you can always take *any* two nouns, A and B, and think to yourself both how A is ""better"" than B and B is ""better"" than A (this is how that game Apples to Apples work, if there are any Apples to Apples fans out there). 

Take for instance... um... a toaster and a weasel. When you first start playing this game while you're driving to work, your ideas might be kind of concrete. A toaster is better than a weasel because it makes better toast. But with practice, you can get more creative. A weasel is better than a toaster because it's easier to conceal in your pants. 

The more you practice, the better at it you get. Same thing for expressing yourself clearly - you'd need to practice. Think of a big, complex topic that you have big complex thoughts about, and spend some time organizing your thoughts. Then repeat. ","1262310285"

We can also talk about specific centuries and specific decades, and we can even name them.  We can talk about *any* 100 year period we want to talk about, and we can talk about *any* 10 year period we want to talk about.  We can name *any* such period.  If I want to say ""the orange decade was the 10 year period from 1993 through 2002"" then then talk about ""the orange decade"" later in the same piece, it'd be silly to tell me that that's not a decade.  Of course it is.  I could also say ""the rabbit century began in 1955"" and as long as I'm clear about context, I'd be perfectly right to say now that ""we have about three and a half decades left in the rabbit century"".

Some names are arbitrary (like the two I just made up above), but other names clearly describe what they're naming, and when there's a public consensus about such names, one doesn't need to provide context.  For example, the name ""the 1980s"" refers to the years 1980-1989.  The name is clear, and people know that's what it refers to.

This is not an inherent difference between centuries and decades.  Both words are equivalent, except for the length of time they refer to.  Both refer to a unit of time, *and* both can be used to refer to *specific* periods of time, and when we do the latter, we can give those specific periods names to make it easier to talk about them.","1262310334"

Some dogs just don't like other dogs. Being aggressive towards other dogs is not the same as being aggressive to a lot of people. 

A lot of people say ""it's all how your raise them"", while it certainly helps setup your dog for success, dogs were bred for certain tasks. Pit bulls get a bad rap but they're great with people (fighting dogs who showed aggression towards people were usually culled since handlers were in the fighting ring with their dogs and the last thing they want is a dog re-directing on them) but have a tendency for dog aggression towards other dogs since their main purpose was dog fighting (I know there are plenty of dog friendly pit bulls).

Some things partners just need to ""get used to"". You can't have a perfect partner no matter what, and if your partner's behavior bothers you because you are oversensitive and insecure, you shouldn't be guilting them into changing.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","First delete the quicktime plist (yes, I know you said youtube). ~/Library/preferences/com.apple.quicktime.plugin.plist -&gt; delete and restart. I would consider how much RAM you have next. Try shutting down some of your applications and viewing youtube in as minimal environment as possible. If that and the rest of the comments here do not solve your problem, read on.

Do you have OS 9, or OS 10? I would recommend you back up all your data before you do anything. What you're describing is not a common problem with macs (aside from flash sucking). What you're describing sounds like a problem with reading/writing to the drive. If you're unable to run hardware tests, I would recommend trying an archive install using the OS discs. It is harmeless (as long as your data is backed up) and will give you a good feel for what the problem is. If it has trouble performing the archive install, then you likely have a bad drive. If it runs through it fine, then you have a working computer again. Yes, there are more advanced software fixes (like deleting .plists), but it's so simple to do an archive install. Archive install preserves all of your settings and applications. It simply replaces the operating system. Be sure to do software updates **before** you do anything else after the archive install.

In all apple certification trainings, you're told to check the RAM first. The most common problem with an apple computer is faulty RAM. However, I think in your case (if it is hardware related) it is more likely a faulty hard drive. I came to this assumption given the age of your computer. The newest powerbook is going to be from 2006. I see drives commonly fail in the 3-4 year range or sooner. Especially in laptops. If it's a new drive, test it anyway. 

Basically, I would recommend you make sure it is actually a bad drive (DFT can do this too, but will require that you remove the drive and plug it into an intel based computer) and then simply replace it.

Finally I called Intuit and explained what was happening. Within 12 hours I got a call from the office of the president of Intuit apologizing for the inconvenience. The complete third party web site had been taken down in the mean time.","1262310437"

"politics","t5_2cneq","We are not regressing as a culture.

The bailouts were necessary to prevent the U.S. from going into another depression. We cannot have large businesses going out of business because of the effects that would be felt everywhere.

The reason we don't get up in arms about our education system is because it is adequate. Unfortunately more schools means financial drains on the states. They would much prefer more prisons that they can throw pot smokers in. They will then make things that can be sold to make profit (those of you who do not believe that prisons are profitable, you are very naive. There are many people interested in making them private businesses because there is a lot of money in it)

As for getting off of oil. Why would we do that? Oil is cheap, there are already refineries everywhere. Some of our largest companies in the US are oil companies. If we switch to another resource then those oil companies would have to fork out billions to change their business for what? Why would we do that?

The facts are that we can easily take anything we want for whatever price we want (hence our removal of saddam hussein who began trying to stick it in our tail pipe). We have no reason to switch fuel sources. It would mean flipping the whole economy on it's head.

If you haven't noticed a theme here... The answer to any ""Why?"" is ""money"".

i wouldnt call myself a fan of his, and you can hate rush all you want, but he does make some accurate political predictions. as soon as kennedy died, the dems began talk of naming the reform bill after him.

to quote robert byrd around 8/26/2009:

[""In his honor and as a tribute to his commitment to his ideals, let us stop the shouting and name calling and have a civilized debate on health care reform which I hope, when legislation has been signed into law, will bear his name for his commitment to insuring the health of every American.""](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0809/Byrd_Rename_health_care_bill_for_Kennedy.html)

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","Such statements as Aerik's ever suffer from brevity, of course. Complex ideas are rarely distilled faithfully into bumper stickers. However I'd say, nevertheless, you misread Aerik.

&gt;So when the exact situation is reversed and women aren't allowed to do something men can do, you'd argue that women themselves are enforcing the rule so that other women won't act like the inferior gender, right?

Women police misogyny out of necessity, just like minorities often internalise racism. The system wouldn't work otherwise. The reasoning is different from group to group however.

Aerik and others (like myself) who point out that men do have limited freedoms will say, quite truthfully, that such is caused by misogyny perpetuating the idea that to emulate women is to lower one's self; while emulating men is considered desirable, especially in the wake of the 1960s.

Here's an innocuous example: Open a catalogue for a major department store and look at how women's wear is advertised. ""Menswear inspired pinstripes..."" ""Menswear themed shirt with a female-inspired cut!"" and so forth. Look at the recent trend towards so called ""boyfriend jackets.""

Can you imagine a ""girlfriend jacket"" being sold to men? Or any menswear advertised with ""Feminine touches enhance the design of this season's hot new blazer""? Absolutely not.

&gt;In fact, it is a societal construct that hurts BOTH genders.

I'm not sure who said otherwise here.

All that is being shown is the simple and fundamental truth: these social constrictions have an *origin.* You seem to be saying that it simply springs fully formed from a vacuum. It doesn't. The idea that women ought to be treated differently has a blowback effect that stabs at men's freedoms and liberties as well. I do not say blowback to *minimise* or marginalise, merely to assert the social location of that set of phenomena relative to its point of origin.

Women and men enforce each other's oppression but the starting point of the particular set of phenomenon that men have to deal with is the societal idea that masculinity is superior to femininity.

Note that I said masculinity and not ""men."" It's a complicated set of ideas, for certain and deserves better treatment than a single Reddit post. In the past it was asserted that men were better than women and that's that. These days it's a little more fluid. Women can be men's equals, but only if they take on masculine traits. Femininity equals girlishness equals childishness. To wear pants is to elevate yourself, to wear a skirt is to denigrate yourself.

I'd highly recommend Julia Serano's magnum opus *Whipping Girl* which brings this phenomenon to light vis a vis the discrete experiences of transsexual women. It's very enlightening.

In sum, I can't speak for Aerik but I doubt she was asserting that the male populace is monolithic. I certainly don't. But macho masculinity is a knock off effect of patriarchal Christendom (you see something similar in the Islamic world) and its policing is an outgrowth of the repression of women. To be feminine is to be like women, which is bad.

To return to your opening sentence:

&gt;So when the exact situation is reversed and women aren't allowed to do something men can do, you'd argue that women themselves are enforcing the rule so that other women won't act like the inferior gender, right?

Women will not (save for a few radicals who are the product of much, much more recent political forces) see men as the ""inferior gender."" They will see women as having a certain place that shouldn't be breached. ","1262310648"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Just a friendly heads-up for future reference --apologies if you already know this; the people who we in the US refer to as the ""Scots-Irish"" haven't lived in Scotland for over 500 years and in the British Isles are referred to as the ""Ulster-Scots,"" which is much less confusing because Ulster (Ireland's northern province) is where they live.  Culturally they are as backward-assed paranoid insular and unforgiving and bigoted and violent as any population you may choose to name in the English-speaking world.  You are very correct that they had a huge influence on Southern (especially redneck) culture and it is no accident, I would argue for example, that KKK rallies and Orangeman parades share a very similar kind of bombast and pageantry aimed ultimately at intimidation.  

Their contribution to US culture has not been all negative --bluegrass and country music (not counting the top-40 crap that comes out of Nashville these days) owes a debt to the Scots-Irish --though the Irish and Scots deserve some credit for them as well-- and they have produced many great Americans--  but sometimes it seems like they picked the worst qualities of their own culture to import to the US.

We're not allowed to rely on nature because men and machines know what's best for our bodies.

When I was pregnant I didn't go to a doctor until I was around 6 months. The nurse that treated me was an utter fucking bitch to me.

I worked as a maintenance aide (read: janitor) at Louden Nelson and the Vets hall. Two places with public bathrooms.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;Why? And why negotiate at all?

The Combine actually use human volunteers in their army (the Civil Protection in white suits).  They realize that humans have been contained by totalitarian governments in the past and creating one with a human figurehead might cut down on rebellions.

&gt;So the people of Earth end up as slaves. Why did the Combine want them to be slaves? Why did the Combine invade to start with? (And again, why not just force them to be slaves instead of negotiating?) 

Remember the level where you can't step on the ground because of the antlions?  Remember the boats that are oddly grounded?  That's because the Combine opened a portal to drain the ocean.  They're using the earth's resources.  The original idea was to have them dumping chemicals to convert the earth's atmosphere, but that was dropped, probably because it was too negative.

&gt;We never see the people in City 17 do any kind of slave labor, I think. All I remember is them huddled in their apartments being scared.

Rebels are sent to Nova Prospekt, and given brain implants to be converted to stalkers (the skinny guys with metal legs) or CP.

&gt;So then the end of HL2 is trying to stop Dr. Breen from escaping, but why? He's just a puppet with no real power. Why not try to find the Combine leaders and go after them? 
The first part is a good question, Breen shouldn't have been a terribly important figure, but perhaps there is a reason we aren't told why he should be killed.  After all, the Combine seem to be doing a lot to try to protect him--they offer to take him with them into an alternate dimension.

&gt;Instead, in an attempt to stop Dr. Breen from leaving, Freeman attacks the reactor core putting the Citadel at risk of exploding and killing everyone in CIty 17. Good job, Gordon, well thought-out.

The Citadel emits some kind of particle or radiation that prevents human conception.  When it's destroyed, people can start to make kids again.

&gt;Then the story gets stupider. Gordon and Alyx stop the Citadel from exploding, but then the Combine reverse it, trying to get the Citadel to explode so they can send a distress message back home. Really? That's their method for communicating with their home base, by destroying their own command center.

&gt;And hey, here's an idea: how about the Combine contact one of the other bases on Earth for help. They took over the whole planet, not just City 17, so there should be plenty of Combine around to lend a hand.

This part is explained somewhat, I'm not entirely sure how but they aren't able to contact other bases.  As for blowing up their station, the whole idea of portals does lend itself to random plot twists because it's not real science.

&gt;So then, Episode 2 opens, the Citadel had blown up and there is a super portal for more Combine to come through. Why they need that when they've already conquered the whole planet is beyond me, but whatever

They haven't subdued the whole planet, in fact they're near losing control of it at the end of Episode 2.  

&gt;Maybe people are confusing immersion with narrative, I don't know.

No offense, but maybe you just didn't study the game enough.

Edit:  Actually it isn't a narrative (there's no narrator), I take that statement back.  But I certainly think it's a fascinating virtual environment.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You've given me some interesting things to consider.  
For now, I'll just give you a first take. Thanks for chiming in.

I wasn't trying to set up a straw man. This is really a rather complex issue. I was making an off-the-cuff rhetorical analysis of labeling all supernatural thoughts and belief systems as ""irrational"". I wasn't trying to suggest that there is a conscious attempt to dehumanize these individuals (hence, my use of ""crypto"").

&gt; In one's mind such a person would already be *inhuman*...

Dehumanizing someone (or a people group) is a matter of degree. A human being is a rather complex phenomenon. Whatever it is to be human, we can agree that it is a least a collection of a number of qualities (however anyone wants to define them). Attacking a specific aspect, such as rational decision-making, shouldn't (I hope) lead one to move an individual from the ""human"" column to the ""inhuman"" column.

&gt; Using rationality to solve problems in the world by definition requires the use of the empirical variables, or else it is purely an abstract process.

So, does math always refer to empirical variables when it is useful? (I'm not a mathematician)","1262310858"

Well, yes. There is in fact a lot of misinformation out there already; I'm sure it would bother you to spread more.

Therefore, along with feeling encouraged, do in fact be careful not to spread misinformation if you can help it.

Sometimes this is as simple as saying ""I get the impression from book X that..."" rather than stating something as an absolute.

It's also nice to try to be sure you understand something thoroughly, preferably from more than one source, if it's something more than a curious tidbit.

And if you haven't already become highly familiar with it, google up the relativity FAQ, which was hosted by John Baez (quantum gravity researcher) last time I checked.

John also has a really cool general relativity tutorial of sorts archived from years back, but it is a quite long and quite challenging, conducted partly as online Q&amp;A. Therein he talks about the real stuff, not watered down. That's why it's quite challenging, even though it's more accessible than any actual general relativity textbook I've ever heard of.

When you look past the exception to find the rule of the nation, however, you'll find that those core values I spoke of earlier, liberty, equality, democracy, justice, those are generally held.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think what they might want from you is the 2-mercaptoethanol denatures the pyrophosphatase, and when that happens it seems to move farther in the gel. If you look at log(MW) vs migration distance for the other 5 proteins, you'll see that they follow a linear pattern (or so they tell us). So you know the migration distance of the protein once it's been denatured properly and you can use that to get the MW. Since the migration distance is between myoglobin and carbonic anhydrase, the MW should be between 17 and 29 (you can calculate it yourself). Also, you should mention (it asks for ""structural properties"") that it has disulfide bonds which, in the folded state, cause it to get ""stuck"" in the polyacrylamide gel and not move as far as when you add the 2-mercaptoethanol.

EDIT: Lemme look at the numbers a bit first though.

EDIT2: Yeah, I seem to be getting a pretty reasonable answer. Let me know if you need more help.

These cars could move suburbanites to larger transportation networks such as train stations that would transfer them to city areas for work. During evening and working hours they could drive people to commercial areas for shopping and entertainment.

If we removed zoning laws, ideally many businesses we require would be able to be just a bike's ride away from home. People could bike daily to grocery stores to purchase only the ingredients they need to make dinner for that day. In that manner we could improve health and wean our dependence on oil.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I'd like to point out that Time Warner knows what they're in for in the long haul. Their digital cable service is little more than encrypted MPEG streams fed over fiber (later on) and coax - you'd know this if their On Demand service has ever crapped out on you. Their digital phone is little more than abstracted VOIP; just a regular cable modem with a little classic-analog ""Oomph,"" if you will.

Time Warner provides internet service to a wide amount of people, and a moderately okay one at that. Sure, speeds and bandwidth might be crappy at times - it all depends on your region's / county's / town's / neighborhood's / street's infrastructure - but they've made clear through migration to fiber optics that data transfer is their service. Not just TV, not just phone (also digital), and not just Internet. Data. It encompasses all three.

This shit seems to happen every year; my family with little kids was worried we'd lose our Viacom shows (Nickelodeon/Noggin, really) this time last year (2008, my ""last year"" pronoun will be inaccurate soon).  DirecTV, I think, is fighting the same battle with Comcast's networks.  It's all about one company trying to piss all over the profits of the other; consumers often get caught in the crossfire.

Keeping customers happy - by keeping rates generally low and fighting the (as we see it) ""good fight"" against ""greedy"" content providers - is Time Warner's surefire way to keep customers in the new age. When TV goes entirely Internet-based, Time Warner customers will know who to call. Or so they hope.

""Possibly, but this is a social media site. So I would hope that we could argue our ideas with merit and offer viable counter arguments and solutions in words. Simply voting for things we like and dislike is a great way to get your point across, but it's also a fairly easy way to scam the system.

But people are reluctant to change. I'm sure for some, seeing + karma offers them a sense of validation. Some will earn it and others will scam for it. For others, karma may not matter at all. I think the examples we saw this past week were fun for a lot of people because it was the holidays and people may have been celebrating a wee bit too much. (Funny how cute those ideas seem at the time.)

Reddit is quite a BIG deal now on the internets. (Which you may recall are like a series of tubes.) As I write this line, we have 202,971 readers on the front page. So the internets is probably not a good place to dare others. Anonymity is quite powerful and intoxicating. Anyway, if only 1/10 of those participated in mass upvoting or downvoting, it would create a tsunami in votes. I think this is what happened to devilsadvocado. Simply wrong post at the wrong time. (And why a grammar nazi hasn't responded to avocado's spelling is a mystery. Unless those downvotes were from them. Hmmm!)""

Also what's up with the low guard and refusing to do good punching technique? There's no reason not to protect your face in any fighting style. I respect a lot of the well developed kicks in Taekwondo, but there's a lot about the style that could learn with Muay Thai.

Then again using only 1 of any style is a bad idea, the best thing for practicality is a combination of styles using only their strengths. I don't mean to be offensive, I just saw a Taekwondo tournament before and it was guys with low guards taking turns kicking eachother.

Yeah! like how car insurance is always cheaper for men... um, no wait.

&gt;a woman still earns about 78 cents to a man's dollar (or $78,000 compared with $100,000 paid to a male colleague with the same level of experience). 

Isn't this illegal? Even if it wasn't, how would any man ever get a job when there  are women who will do the job just as well for much less?  Something doesn't seem to add up here.

&gt;So, gals, it's up to us. Whenever you make a purchasing decision, do a little research to find out whether you're paying that special price for being a woman. Then buy like a man and get what you want for a better rate.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'v always wondered this. I assume it is because most religion also has an element of guilting and shaming woman. Religions like Christianity and Islam arn't exactly female friendly. When you are born into a more radically religious family and take in more of that guilt and shame, leaving your religion probably becomes harder, and the threat of ""hell"" or whatever it may be becomes more real. In hyper religious families, en tend to have a little bit more freedom to get educated and make their own choices. Some of the really *really* religious families I have heard of own south will discourage their girls from going to college and breed them to become house wives and good mothers. I'v seen a ton of episodes of Wife Swap like that, haha. 

I also think that a lot of woman are (for whatever reason) more willing to stick to something to please their family or out of habit. I know a lot of girls that are generally non religious/skeptics, but still call themselves ""Christian"". 

Im sure that is a very simplistic and silly guess, but it's all I can really come up with. I really wish I could hear some badass, well thought theory on the subject.

So the future in which SkyNet became self-aware was more than 12 years ago.  The Terminator II movie was more than 18 years ago, and the original film that introduced the mythos was more than 25 years ago.

I have not really looked at the newer editions of this book or the Minix kernel, but I studied the first edition, and the Minix 1.0 kernel, which came in somewhere around 10,000 lines of code.

With a few months of study, you will learn the important bits of what is at the core of a Unix operating system, and it is not unreasonable to understand what is going on in the *entire* kernel. 

It is important to note that the name ""Linux"" is actually a contraction of ""Linus' Minix"" as initially Linus started kernel development by hacking early versions of Minix.  It was not long, however, before all of the Minix bits went away and what was left purly Linus' work, later added to by the teeming millions.

What makes a game great is how enjoyable it is, and I found DA to be extremely enjoyable, so to me it's a great game.  

Your whole point is flawed. You can think a game is great because you enjoy it, but I have news for you: that doesn't make it great.

Capitalism is dependent on an energy gradient from which value can be extracted.  Contrary to Marx's belief that the side effect of human existence (namely human labor) is the only thing of value that capitalists exploit, capitalists actually exploit an entire repetiteur of instruments.  Once oil goes away, capitalism will once again become dependent on agriculture (the value extracted from an energy gradient produced by the sun) and we will once again be looking at a society like ancient Egypt that was managed by controlling agriculture.

Even after that, for a few weeks or months, you'll stop cutting yourself, but it really won't be that much better a shave than you used to get.  You can and will still give yourself razor burn for a while with a straight blade (holding it at the wrong angle.)

Aha, but!  With practice, you'll learn your face, your hands will learn how to hold the razor without having to think about it too much, and your face will toughen up some.  And THAT is when you'll start getting such an amazing shave that you'll never go back.

You know what...  I'm tired of trying to argue this shit about mortgages and foreclosures.  I see it every day, I talk to the people that are losing homes, I go to the neighborhoods and I know what I know.  I'm tired of trying to tell people the reality of this shitty ""mortgage crisis"" and have some know-it-all try and tell me they know more than I do because the interwebz told them so.

The bottom line, and last thing I'll say about any of this shit is this:  You sign on the dotted line you are responsible to pay back what you agreed to, end of story.  If you could not do that to begin with you should not have taken the loan.  If you could afford it but circumstances cause you not to be able to pay then I feel bad for you but that is the way it has always been, foreclosures are not some surprise move recently started by the banks.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;I admire your utopian hope that education and rationality will encourage people to take externalities into account. But who provides the education?

People do. I see no distinction between a parent, a teacher, or a government poster, save that the parent and the teacher have a vested interest. As for believing that education encourages people to alter their actions - that is simply a fact of nature. People act based on their information.

&gt;Externalities are often to subtle for people to understand: for example, the fact that cigarettes can cause health risks.

If _I personally_ think there are health risks when smoking cigarettes, then I will spread that knowledge to those around me. If it is unknown that bananas cause hypoglycemia (just as an example), then that ""externality"" won't be internalized. To the extent that people value their health (and know of the risks), they will make different decisions. I see no justification for making said decision for them. As for informing people of what I think is important, like I said, this is the place of education and activism in our civilization.

&gt;Someone has to stick warning labels on cigarettes and spend umpteen million dollars on public education, and put large taxes on tobacco, in order for smoking rates to drop.

I disagree strongly. Just because the government spent umpteen million dollars on tobacco education doesn't mean that is why people are educated about tobacco (correlation does not equal causation).

&gt;Information does not magically appear to people: someone has to broadcast it.

I never suggested wizardry, but I am suggesting that ""government men"" are just the same as ""citizen men"". We _all_ spread information, and I don't think a certain group monopolizing on said information does any good at all. In fact, I would go so far as to say the anti-slander laws, the FCC regulations and the intellectual property rights laws do _far_ more to protect big tobacco than anything else in our country. The pathetic forced awareness advertising campaigns are all _jokes_. Know a kid who took DARE seriously? Know a kid who takes TRUTH seriously? No. Know a kid who listens to his older brother or best friend when they take the time to explain why cigarettes are bad? I do - my little bother. People tend to think the free market makes thing ""magically happen"". Rather, it _is the way the human race associates_ in such a way that complex goods become cheap and accessible, jobs become profitable and fulfilling, and society becomes rich and cultured.

&gt;If emitting carbon has a tax or a price, then the fact that carbon emitting is bad is immediately apparent.

Following your logic: If all carrots have a price, then the fact that eating carrots is bad is immediately apparent.

Welcome to the planet earth: People willingly pay for services others are willing to provide. Reddit has a cost - is it bad? All we can do is point from our Judges table and say ""That purchase was _stupid_!"". We are nothing but critics on the sideline. To me or you, it might be ""bad"", in that maybe me or you wouldn't have emitted the carbon. However, for someone for whom carbon emission is the goal...","1262311658"

&gt;Ever wonder why there's no physical descriptions of people in the Bible? Didn't matter. 

If this is the argument you are going to use then it also does not matter that we have any gospel accounts of the arrest, trial, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension of Jesus. It could all be explained in one sentence, void of all descriptive language. 

&gt;He's pointing to the origins of the Passion narrative.

Without giving one single detail of the Passion narrative.

""he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Peter""

It says he was raised on the third day. It does not say that he appeared to Peter on the third day.

&gt;That's because Jesus was slain from the foundation of the world.(cf. Revelation 13:8).

And Paul is very consistent in saying things like...

Ephesians 3

4 the mystery of Christ, 5 which was not made known to men in other generations as **it has now been revealed by the Spirit** to God's holy apostles and prophets.

Shouldn't that read, ""it has now been revealed by the ministry and sacrifice of Jesus of Nazareth""?

and...

10 His (God's) intent was that **now, through the church,** the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,

I started out using the bar soap that came in the bundle. But, my mom got me the CO-Bigelow tube of shaving cream, so I started using that. It's not the best, but it's easier to make the lather with it. Plus, it makes my face feel minty fresh :D

I'd recommend getting a used Merkur, or something similar, if you're still unsure about jumping into wet shaving. Some people don't like it, like my dad, because it's so time consuming. I don't really think it's that slow of a process. I'd say it's relaxing. :D","1262311784"

It's speaking directly about online dating, where your first impression often has very little to do with your personality. That's a very confined statistical grouping of a particular set of men and women looking for a very particular thing.

When presented with a list of sexually interested relationship-seekers, where almost every profile ""seems attractive"", as it is intended to be, it is simply unavoidable that the deciding factor will be physical attraction.

Meet a girl in a random place, as OP spoke about, and you'll find it has much much less to do with your physical appearance (short of puss-leaking pimples and no-shower hair) and much more with your self-confidence, candor and sociability.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I think the idea is that if a key can open many locks, then that key is special/powerful/amazing because it possesses the ability to triumph over the lock's power.  The lock's only purpose is to not be opened, so a key that can open it has, in effect, proven itself superior to the lock's ability.

On the other hand, a lock that is opened by many keys is a lock that lacks power.  Since the lock's only job is to prevent access, each additional key that opens the lock weakens the lock's perceived ability.

That's why, in the case of this analogy, the key that opens many locks is admirable (because the key's only purpose is to open locks), while a lock that is opened by many keys is scorned (because a lock's only purpose is to refuse entry to keys).

The key's ability to open many locks is a triumph of the key's original abilities, whereas the lock's ability to be opened by many keys is a failure of the lock's overall design.","1262311821"

I was a young (20-21) year old Sergeant in Iraq in ~2005, and I was in charge of logistic combat patrols in the Tikrit AO. For the most part the various PMC's and operators were very cool, and respected my position. But there were a few times where I basically had to yell: ""listen motherfucker, this is my patrol, and these are my vehicles, if you want to get to Speicher, you're going to shut the fuck up and listen to the combat briefing"". 

Oh, also, what kind of qualifications do they look for for non combat positions (if those exist). I had a combat MOS, and was a Non-Com, but I've been out for ~5 years. There are days when I just want to say ""fuck being a computer nerd"" and go back to Iraq, where life is easy.","1262311845"

Dodie sat next to Blanche, who was quite grateful for the diversion, wearing a short tee-shirt with the picture of a rhinoceros fucking a hippopotamus.

""A bit gruesome,"" admitted Blanche. ""I don't know what people see in this kind of stuff.""

""I just don't go out in the sun very often.""

Blanche responded in form, heaving around her bulk and pulling Dodie's slender bony body against the folds and cushions of her flesh. Dodie swivelled around and climbed onto Blanche's body, a finger twiddling her nipple and another already caressing the vagina obscured beneath the piled folds of flesh that was her stomach.

I've been in probably 2 dozen street/bar fights (I was a bouncer).  Trust me, I'm a street fighter first and foremost.  I learned self-defense, proper punching/kicking technique, throws, takedowns, pressure points, breaks/bars/etc...from Taekwondo.  I took all that, and applied it to my street style.  I use a mix of Taekwondo, jujitsu, Muy Thai, Judo, wrestling, and boxing.  And I've never lost a fight,  not even so much as a bloody nose or black eye.  I would never use a strict Taekwondo fighting style in a fight.  So take that for what it's worth.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Change is not easy at all, don't even kid yourself. As people get older and older their opinions and ideas become more and more cemented into their being. For drastic change to occur you basically need the previous generation to die/move on and have a politically active younger generation.


Possibly because of the Nixon inspired false perception of everyone being in government being corrupt, young people don't want to get involved in politics. Or possibly because the technology has advanced so quickly the older generation has not been able to understand and react to the current need for alternative resources (since oil worked so well for their old cars.)


The idea that we should use the power of the dollar to initiate change in the government or society is simply silly. In most class conflicts (which this argument does eventually boil down to) it's rich vs. poor. Even if you did invest all of the money you could into nuclear power it wouldn't amount to much compared to the sway that an oil tycoon has and considering that most people live from paycheck to paycheck this is especially true (not to mention that campaign donations count for a lot more than an investment in the congressman's eyes.)","1262312086"

The ""attractive"" girls seemed shallow (not really their fault when men all over are spamming them every day due to a picture). I wasn't into any of the people who I talked to. So I stopped visiting it for a long time. 

Then one night I got bored, I received an email from the site so I logged in and started playing around again. I was going through random matches when I saw a cute nerd who was kind of pretty. I read her profile and she was really into community work, helping special needs children, volunteering, that kind of stuff - and she loved the internet. With very little faith I sent her a message... and got a really nice reply! We've now talked until 4-5AM multiple nights in the last week and we plan to meet up on Saturday. 

I'm not sure about this whole online thing really, but from what I can tell this is a really awesome girl who I'd like to be friends with even if it doesn't ""work out"" as being more than that.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I agree that it's more convenient, but you're adding another special case to the language. This is why C#'s spec is so huge. The academic crowd think it's an advantage if your language is so simple that it can be understood completely by a single human, and if you do add complexity they want to make sure that it's a generally useful feature.

A better approach I think is to try to understand why you have this problem in the language and then define a general solution to it. If you add an implicit conversion to option&lt;T&gt; now, then you might walk into a similar problem another time and if you're not a F# language designer you can't do anything about it. So the general problem is not conversion from T to option&lt;T&gt;, but conversion from an arbitrary type to an arbitrary other type. So you want a general construct to convert types to other types implicitly. This is what Scala's implicit conversions do.","1262312145"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Spiders don't suck, they are just trying to get by like the rest of us.

I grew up in Ireland and even though there are no poisonous spiders there, I had almost paralyzing arachnophobia for as long as I can remember.  Its an irrational fear, but knowing its irrational doesn't help, it operates at a deeper level than that.  Even the sight of a spider would result in a dramatic elevation in adrenalin, which is not a pleasant experience.

3 years ago I moved to Austin, Texas (via LA and various other places).  Last week I found a tarantula in our basement.

Weirdly, living in a place with spiders the size of your hand has actually reduced my arachnophobia.  While I'd never touch a spider deliberately, I don't stay up at night worrying about them either, as I used to when I was a child.

Turns out they have some cool spiders here.  Jumping spiders, for example, are very smart - they will actually turn to face you so that they can watch you more effectively.  You can even ""herd"" them, as they'll jump away from you if you get too close.

Tarantulas are also kinda cool, they won't hurt humans unless they feel threatened, and the worst they can do is a bite like a bee sting - or I guess the problem described above too.

I have a policy of never hurting spiders, nor allowing or encouraging others to do so, its a karma thing.  If I'm nice to them, maybe they'll be nice to me.

(My wife carefully removed the tarantula and put it outside).","1262312163"

Thus Israel subdued Ammon. 34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of tambourines! She was an only child.

""Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry."" 38 ""You may go,"" he said. And he let her go for two months.

""1 During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, ""It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death."" 2 The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.) 3 David asked the Gibeonites, ""What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the LORD's inheritance?"" 4 The Gibeonites answered him, ""We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.""  ""What do you want me to do for you?"" David asked. 5 They answered the king, ""As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel, 6 let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul—the Lord 's chosen one."" So the king said, ""I will give them to you."" 7 The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul. 8 But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 9 He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed and exposed them on a hill before the LORD. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning. 10 Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds of the air touch them by day or the wild animals by night. 11 When David was told what Aiah's daughter Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had done, 12 he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had taken them secretly from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.) 13 David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up. 14 They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul's father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land. [2 Samuel 21:1-14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2021:1-14&amp;version=NIV) (NIV)

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Most neuropsychologists majored in psychology or neuroscience in college. Academically, majoring is psychology is not as challenging as majoring in one of the biological or chemical sciences. (But it helps if you can write long papers!) 

Usually, majoring in psychology involves taking a certain number of 'core' courses covering general psych, abnormal psych, cognitive psych, developmental psych, social psych, and physiological psych, statistics, and some electives. I would say that most students find statistics to be the most challenging class. In my college, you had to do a thesis (long research project) if you wanted to graduate with honors, but you didn't have to do one just for the major. 

Graduate school is a long process... usually, students are in graduate school between four and seven years, and you have to do a one year clinical internship at the end of it all. If you did well as a psychology major in college, you will probably do fairly well in graduate school. Graduate school involves a combination of coursework, a lot of clinical training (e.g., seeing patients while receiving supervision), and training in how to conduct research. To get a doctorate, you have to do a big long research project (dissertation) showing that you know how to conduct research independently. 

Neuropsychologists can work in research, they can teach, or they can focus mostly on clinical work. Some neuropsychologists work mostly with older adults, some work mostly with children, some work with all ages. Some focus on specific disorders (e.g., people who had brain tumors), others are more generalist.

5. Your only justified point is about her making unaffordable visits.

If you really want to help her, you should talk to her without condemning her in such a baseless fashion. You should just make her understand that you can't afford the costs and say that she should rather explore things with videos or books. 

Exploring 'enlightenment', or awareness of things as they are, is a genuine quest and you ought to see it as what it is - exploration of the self.

So here goes...

I dated a girl for 8 years. She left me for my 42 year old boss...so naturally...as any man would in my situation....I wanted to fuck one of my female friends. 

I called up a friend and we headed downtown. We get done in the back of my car and I jump up to the front seat. Car won't start. I've got a signed contract for a gig i gotta model at...I'm fucked right. Call a friend and get a ride home/borrow her car. The next morning...I wake up to an officer at my front door. My brother violated probation and it's off to prison for him. Yay. After watching him get loaded into the patrol car, I went to my gig using my friends car. Get done with the gig and head downtown to check on my car..won't start..but I've got to be in Miami in a couple of hours..haven't slept...so I pull of the parking ticket, leave a note that I'm broke down..and head home. I come back the next day and my car is gone. It's a Friday afternoon. I get to the impound lot, and I'm informed that due to the two parking tickets I got...there is a hold on my car and it can't be released until Monday morning after I pay the tickets, storage fees, admin fees, towing fees, and etc. I had the money to pay all that..but the courthouse was closed and I was fucked. After the weekend rolls around...The cost has doubled and I can't afford it.

Fast forward about 30 days. Wells Fargo repossess my car so that the impound wouldn't sell it. They claim it's because they wouldn't have received any cash if the car was sold by the impound (THIS IS FALSE!!! Any profit from auction goes to Finance Company). Wells Fargo now tacks on tons of fees and eventually auctions my car.

I now owe $5k on a car I'll never drive again. I had made 32 payments at $350 apiece.

Ya wanna know the real kicker to this whole story???

The parking tickets were not a valid reason to hold my car. It should have been released on the first day that I went there and had enough cash to pick it up. The owner of the Impound lot had called and discussed this with the city on Monday and he withheld this info from me. 

Parking enforcement says fuck you, Impound lot says fuck you, Wells Fargo says Fuck You...Ya..I got fucked.

You tell them not to do something and insult them, of course they're going to do it. Not because they have anything against you - trolls generally don't care about anyone.

"science","t5_mouw","Mandatory voting with a preferential voting system with is the most critical element.

The mandatory voting means that politics is never defined by fringe issues, because the fringe elements hold no power over the actual voting. Every constituent is a voter. This restricts political debate to 'real' issues that matter to real people, plus it creates a *far* more informed citizenry (e.g. people/families/friends actually discuss the content of the federal budget every year. Changes to things like abortion rights/gay marriage are *side issues*). 

The preferential voting (not as unique) is a great way of removing the 'lesser of two evils' problem - your vote is an ordered list of preferences. If your first preference (e.g Nader) isn't a contender, your vote goes to your second preference (e.g. Democrats).  

Without electronic communication, mechanical counting systems and an urbanised population, such a voting system would be inconceivable.

Here are a few of the more obvious examples of how a blank slate has helped us: 

[APRA](http://www.apra.gov.au/aboutapra/): the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is a federal authority charged with **all** financial regulation - Banks, Superannuation, Investment - everything. The existence of a body like APRA is the sole reason why Australia didn't have dodgy mortgages during the financial crisis (a large contributing factor to us being only developed country in the world not to enter into a recession). 

[Centrelink](http://www.centrelink.gov.au/): In Australia, there is one government office that is charged with being the center of all federal government citizen services. Similar offices include: [Austrade](http://www.austrade.gov.au)

[Medicare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Australia) (Univeral Health Care) + [Medibank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medibank_Private) (*Government Business Enterprise* private health insurer) ","1262312371"

The more cynical response would be that 21st century American culture raises you to *think* you are not robots and that you have freedom while the reality is that the vast bulk of the American public simply think and act in ways heavily dictated by the mass media and corporate spin.

If the U.S. really was a bastion of freedom and independence then it would not have the world's highest incarceration rate with corporate-run prisons full of people convicted of trivial victimless crimes.

* It makes them superficially non-threatening to people being proseletysed, allowing them to increase in popularity quickly.

* It plays well into humanity's basic urge to engage in holier-than-thou posturing.

* None of the aforementioned religions are *actually* peaceful, so you get the best of both worlds.

Judaism is the general exception here -- Jews worship a relatively terrible, vengeful, and petty God, and make no bones about it.  Ironically, before the creation of the state of Israel (which, incidentally, was founded by a secular rather than religious movement, Zionism) Jews were probably the most peaceable of the bunch.  Actually, come to think of it, even *with* the State of Israel they probably are still the major religious group *least* associated with religiously-motivated warmongering.

fermentation took off, quite quickly, and continued strong. I racked it like 2 weeks later. When racking i added some cinnamon sticks i had boiled in water to sterilize. By the time I racked to secondary it was already ~9%abv. if you want hard cider i would use muton ale yeast and not add sugar.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","It seems you have a very narrow definition of violence. Why should we render ourselves impotent in struggles against coercion by ignoring the violence inherent in oppressive power structures even though they may not include a directly, physically violent act? If it's initiation of violence that you're hung up on, allow me to put forth the idea that violence is initiated the instant that one seeks dominion over another, be it through economic, social, political, or directly physical means. You hold forth in your original statement that initiation of violence against the (capitalist) oppressor is un-anarchistic and (presumably) wrong. However, if you can allow yourself to agree with the above idea, any act of violence against the oppressor can only be seen as an act of self-defense and, through your logic, justified.

This does not mean that we should only seek progress and change through violence, but that to have such a narrow view of violence and to ignore how violence is enacted upon us every day through systemic means and to then go on about how *initiation* of violence against the oppressor in any sort of struggle is *wrong* is a bit silly and certainly limiting.","1262312666"

Halo.

It revolutionized console shooters. Sure, fps games existed on consoles in the past (Goldeneye, Wolfenstein) but Halo really changed it all. Before Halo, there wasn't really a modern multiplayer component of fps games - you pretty much played four players on the same console in split screen.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sometimes.  Most of the time I'm depressed because unforeseen expenses keep outpacing my salary.  For example, I just discovered the siding on my house had been leaking water (when it rains, of course) for years.  The plywood behind the siding is soaked.  I only noticed it because a window recently started dripping water.  I removed some drywall  and found it.  I removed more drywall and found it's extends the entire side of the house.  It's been leaking for a long time, but there was no sign until now.  Insurance won't cover it and I don't have the money to replace it.  Winter is here and I have to decide whether to rip down all of the drywall and insulation or let it dry, causing heating costs to rise, or to let it wait until spring when the heavy rains hit.  There is currently frost between the insulation and the plywood.    I started looking for a second job today so I can afford replacement siding.  

That's just one example.  Last year a guy ran a light and totaled our car.  I fought with his insurance for four months.  

But then I have my family who loves and supports me - that makes me happy.  But if I'm working two jobs when will I see them?

Applying an already-written patch to remove a single button from the UI doesn't exactly require a huge investment.  In relation to my assertion that the sentiment in your reply represented an elitist attitude,  I feel that the sentiment can be enumerated more simply as ""Well, if you're too stupid to set a master password, then you *deserve* to have your passwords taken.""  I've also observed that, if you show the button to a non-software developer type user, they generally will be kind of shocked.

A similar issue was (and perhaps still is, I'm not sure) found in Ubuntu; on the bootloader screen, one could select ""recovery mode"" and log in as a root user with no password, which also strikes me as ridiculous.  Now, will removing that option stop a dedicated malicious individual with access to your computer?  Of course not.

&gt;And yet, major religions—put down your crystals and pocket those pentagrams, ladies—

I'd sooner not put down the crystals and pentagrams.

Any analysis of faith must include those outside the Abrahamic traditions. One of my closest friends is a Goddess worshipping woman who criticises mainline religion in so withering a fashion as to make Christopher Hitchens blush. I've also known more than a few other women who ""claim religious affiliation"" but are no friends of the faiths that have treated women so shabbily. Or they are part of the very progressive branches of those faiths.

So the picture gets more complex.

Yet a disparity exists and must be explained. My take is that it has to do with many things. Internalised sexism is there, of course. The fact that women are still in lower numbers in the scientific world- which inculcates the sceptical sensibility that makes doctrinaire religious faith that much harder to hold. But these explanations feel, to me, too simplistic, too *modus ponens* to be of great value. They're operative factors but one of several, I suspect.

Religion does work harder at maintaining a sacred sort of submissive femininity than a specific vision of masculinity, I'd say. Western religion has long extolled women's virtual enslavement in the home, that to be a mother was to emulate the Virgin Mary and a sacred role for which you would be rewarded. For women, love of God is meant to mean submission to the Lord *and* to men. We are commanded to obey our fathers and our husbands as we would *The* father.

Men are also compelled to submit before God, but not necessarily to another class of human beings, making it easier to rationalise breaking away from the strictures of organised religion and putting said man on the road towards not being religious at all. Women have more socialised into them vis a vis their role in religious faith that they have to overcome. (There are also things like the sanctity of your virginal purity and so forth, for which there's no overt male cognate.)

These are huge generalisations, of course. But those are *some* of the forces at work here.","1262312954"

To fix the spinning problem, what you don't want to do is put a limit on what the player can do, like saying you can't spin and shoot for too long.  That will feel artificial and stupid.  I haven't looked at the code, but it looks right now like you're doing an even distribution and just altering how many and what type of enemy spawns.  What would work is to adjust where the enemies spawn to defeat this tactic.  If at random, all the enemies spawned on the right side, you'd be screwed if you were just spinning.  Half your shots would be wasted.  Something like that would be a much better fix than putting rules in place to say you can't do that.  Let people do that, just make it ineffective.  :)","1262312975"

From the other side of the coin I'll let you know what I see. My bank wants business / market share. They do that by trying to be friendly, helpful and offer essentially the same service that all the other banks offer (While trying to rely on image and advertising to bring people in). The banks make money by fees and the interest spread (Difference between loan interest rates and investment interest rates) Fees are a smaller portion of the banks income, the interest rate spread is much larger. However this only works if all loans are paid back. So unlike predatory lending institutions the bank does not want to bleed you dry. 0% credit cards / loans only bring in profits when fees or high interest penalties are added on. They COUNT on you not making all the payments, and fill the agreement with limitations and loopholes.

2. Wizardry 8 (2001): The absolute pinnacle of old school dungeon crawling CRPG's. Unfortunately, the glory days of its sub-genre have passed and so has Sirtech, it's publisher. The other game I come back to at least once every 6 months.

3. Baldur's Gate II +Expansion (2000): Brilliant story telling coupled with classic Dungeons and Dragons gameplay translated to a PC.

4. Portal(2007): Amazing. Just amazing. 

5. Red Alert 2 +Yuri's Revenge (2000): My favorite RTS of the decade, no question.

6. Elder Scrolls Oblivion + Shimmering Isles (2005): The first real powerhouse American RPG I played.

7. Warcraft III (2001?): Amazing RTS gameplay with mastercraft storytelling.

8. Bioshock (2007): I'm not an FPS fan, but dammit if this game didn't almost convert me.

9. Borderlands (2009): Hey, you got your Diablo in my Fallout! No, you got your Fallout in my CoD!

Speaking of Europe, the Dutch [Tulip Mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_craze) represented a completely Free-Market speculative bubble. In fact, commodity markets (and Financial Markets, for that matter) are all subject to speculative bubbles. What evidence is there that a privately managed currency wouldn't be subject to those same animal spirits? What recourse would the public have if the managers of a privately managed currency or currency system act unscrupulously and tank the currency? Wouldn't the presence of multiple currencies increase the cost of making transactions?

Furthermore, there were plenty of non-Austrian economists who *correctly* predicted the crash. The problem is that the jackasses in charge listened to the chowder heads who said what their bosses wanted to hear in order to get and keep those cushy political jobs.

I'd like to propose a new one: **A complete and utter lack of vision.**

Plato's *Republic* discusses the need for philosophy as a prerequisite for good government, today we have lost that completely. Would you call more than a handful of modern politicians philosophers? They do what they must out of self interest, and not much more. I've become disillusioned with Obama because he has more or less abandoned the progressive philosophy he embodied in his campaign. However, all politicians must, because otherwise you lose the race.

I've always been amazed by 2001: A Space Odyssey because it presents a *vision* of human society that seemed possible given the progress of the 1960s. Before 1903 heavier than air flight hadn't been done. 66 years later we landed on the moon using a rocket that weighed *six million pounds*. Think about that for a second. Feasibly, if we had kept going along that path we'd be exploring the solar system by now, with colonies on multiple planets.

Without a vision of how society can be better, we are doomed to fail. The path of our civilization is mostly shaped behind closed doors, not discussed publicly between leading intellectuals as I personally think it should be.

Asking people to shoulder the burden completely is almost too much. People today are far too stressed, busy, and overwhelmed to make the best possible choices.

This all seems trite after looking over it, but fuck it. My two cents nonetheless.

In this case, the man gives his sperm knowing full well that a child will be made for another couple, not him, and the couple knew that as well. The knowledge set in these cases are different.

**Fruits and vegetables**

Of course everybody should eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. But eating plenty of fruits and vegetables won't likely decrease your headaches. Having said that, it is true that some fruits and vegetables contain substances that could theoretically influence headache:

* Cruciferous vegetables (vegetables in the genus Brassica: cabbage, red cabbage, broccoli, broccoli sprouts, turnip, rape, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kohlrabi, chard, kale, bok choy, radish, horseradish, daikon, mizuna, tatsoi, collard greens, mustard greens, rutabaga, and watercress) contain indole-3-carbinole, a chemical that accelerates caffeine metabolism, so may promote caffeine withdrawal and thereby promote migraine.

* Vegetables in the genus Allium, including onions and garlic, may promote migraine by increasing the concentration of extracellular adenosine.

* Grape juice. The linked article says, ""grape juices can help you heal your migraine problem,"" but it may be grape juice could make headaches more frequent. A scientific study in which grape juice was accidentally substituted for grapefruit juice serendipitously revealed that grape juice increases the activity of the enzyme phenacetin O-dealkylase. That means grape juice likely increases the rate of caffeine metabolism and may thereby promote caffeine withdrawal and therefore migraine. If so, that might explain why so many people report that wine, more than other alcoholic drinks, seems to promote their migraines. 

* Grapefruit may slow caffeine catabolism so may make caffeine withdrawal headache less likely to occur, and thereby protect against primary headache. Grapefruit has not, however, been demonstrated to decrease headache frequency. Naringin had been thought to be the active ingredient in grapefruit that slows caffeine catabolism, but a recent study casts doubt on that.
       
* Apiaceous vegetables such as carrots and celery slow caffeine metabolism, so may make caffeine withdrawal less likely and thereby decrease migraine frequency. Apiaceous vegetables have not, however, been demonstrated to decrease migraine frequency. 

**Tea**

The linked article says, ""In some cases, ingesting caffeine can cure your headache. But too much of caffeine consumption can do the opposite.""

Tea isn't really a food, but, leaving aside the question of whether it's a food or not, the reason tea relieves migraines is that tea contains DRUGS: theophylline and caffeine. The theophylline and caffeine in tea relieve headache by reversing caffeine withdrawal.

The ability of tea to both promote and relieve headaches is a seeming paradox but is readily explained by the mechanism of addiction and withdrawal. The reason tea is both headache cause and headache medicine is that tea contains addictive drugs. Tea both causes and relieves migraine for the same reason heroin both causes and relieves heroin withdrawal symptoms.

**Peppermint, passionflower, ginger**

These may have some effect on migraine, good or bad, though this has never, to my knowledge, been demonstrated scientifically.","1262313229"

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's funny you say that, because in my personal experience I have had much stronger connections with my neighbors while living in a cosmopolitan city than while living in the suburbs. (I am making an assumption that this is what you are implicitly comparing against. Forgive me if I'm wrong.) I can also attest to stronger neighborly connections in the tiny rural town where my mother lived for about a decade. My theory, for what it's worth:

In a cosmopolitan city the physical proximity between neighbors and the higher likelihood of walking in your neighborhood to get from place to place forces a more frequent rate of interaction. One may not know neighbors who live more than a few blocks from himself, but he will likely know many who live on his own street, which is still a substantial number.

Meanwhile, in a tiny town there are so few locations of interest that one is bound to run into many of his neighbors frequently, and there are so few neighbors in total that one can remember and get to know them all without too much difficulty, despite the large distances between their homes, and despite the fact that they drive to the locations of interest.

Suburbia, however, seems to minimize the number of unavoidable neighborly interactions almost by design. The number of locations of interest are great enough to not require that all neighbors frequent the same places. The total number of people in the community is too high to allow one to remember or get to know all the neighbors he does encounter at the locations of interest, which is a disincentive to interact at all. The distances from the home to locations of interest are too far to walk. The distances between homes are too far to force interactions at or around the home, save maybe infrequent interactions with one's direct neighbors to either side while doing lawn work or something.

Of course I'm not suggesting that there are no examples of tight knit communities in the suburbs, but it does seem to me that such tight bonds with one's neighbors arise more naturally--perhaps even out of necessity--in metropolitan or tiny rural areas, whereas it must be completely (or at least mostly) ""forced"" in suburban communities.","1262313265"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If we are comparing a 'godless' big bang to a big bang 'with god' then we are accepting as assumption for discussion that the big bang theory is more or less correct.

That assumption at *least* implies that the godless big bang theory is true. Adding god as an additional assumption to the theory is, well,  an additional assumption. Adding the god assumption creates more questions than answers--as mentioned before it adds a layer of complexity that is not necessary.

It may well be true that our universe rests on the back of an infinite series of turtles... we simply do not know... but it makes more sense to operate using fewer unfounded assumptions--instead of piling on more.

It's one thing to accidentally drop a few pieces of popcorn around your seat- and something else entirely to throw a whole bag at someone, spill drinks all over and leave open wrappers everywhere. 
When I have done these things by accident I have told the the staff i was sorry and shown them the mess. As I would if I accidentally made a mess in a restaurant. So yeah- it's their job to clean it but people can be nicer about it. And throw out their own cups and wrappers and boxes. 
Also when I saw Cloverfield people were throwing up in their seats- including the guy behind us who got some in our hair/clothes. It was DISGUSTING- we felt very bad for the staff having to clean up after these lazy slobs who couldn't even bother to puke in the trash cans and toilets- instead it was on the floor, seats, and sinks. DISGUSTING.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; Is there such a thing as hypochondria with regards to mental illness? I sometimes wonder whether I actually have problems, or whether I merely think that I do. Though I suppose that thinking that you do is probably a problem in itself!

There's actually a cliche amongst psychologists that if the person ""thinks"" they might be crazy, then they aren't. The trouble comes when the person ""thinks"" everything is fine. 

We all wonder sometimes if there is something wrong with us. Some people worry about it more than others, even when there is really nothing wrong. But sometimes, our worries are our mind's way of telling us that something's wrong and we should go talk to someone!

And if your worries are causing you a lot of distress, than yes, thinking that you have a problem could actually be your problem. 

As for marijuana use, I can understand why you are confused. There is research that suggests that people who experience a psychotic break tend to be heavy marijuana users. However, that is entirely correlational, and it might just be that they were using marijuana to self-medicate before they started experiencing clear psychosis. 

Additionally, not everyone has a great reaction to marijuana. Many people feel paranoid and uncomfortable under the influence, whereas others very much like the feeling. I tend to think that marijuana is fairly benign, and I am all for exploring its medical applications, but **please don't listen to my opinion on this** because I don't want to be the neuropsychologist who ""advocates"" drug use. I do not advocate drug use. Did I mention the part where I do not advocate drug use? 

Here's an [interesting article](http://lifestyle.msn.com/your-life/bigger-picture/articledoublex.aspx?cp-documentid=21992648) on the use of medical marijuana in a 9 year-old with autism for people who didn't see it the first time around (I think I originally found it on reddit). ","1262313464"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I don't know, I've worked pretty hard, lots of other people have worked hard, and there's some pretty lazy french people too.   It helps to just have a little historical perspective.   To summarize the difference in Europe and here in a couple of sentences, they brought their slavery here, and we've had to fix it here.   There was probably more labor unrest here a century ago (look up what city invented May Day), but over and over again, the right wing would use race dividing tactics to win.  There's some very specific moments where it was important, e.g. during the national strikes for the eight hour day, the workers had actually broken into city armories and were using cannon against troops.  That strike was defeated really with black strikebreakers, but not only did the white workers not allow black people in their unions, they'd been lynching black people in a big chicago white race riot a couple of months before.  When social democratic parties were starting to win in Europe, we still had Jim Crow in this country, we did not have multi race unions for decades.  Black people in the south got the vote at best about 1970, barely before the current president was born.  While we were working on allowing a significant portion of our citizens to go to the same restrooms, europeans spent that energy getting dental insurance, 35 hour work weeks, and socialized vacation homes.  A european starts out in a union, they start out not having to deal with crazy medical bills, we start out with our lives weighed down by those things--I spent ten years of my life doing politics nearly every second of it, but you'd have gotten five more from me if I'd just had insurance five years earlier.   We're living in an emerging democracy, and this is what it feels like.  None of us feel like we have anything to do with the truly bad things that happened in this country, but we do have to carry the burden of it, and it's not really about feeling guilty or something, it's about starting out behind.

Differential equations with sketchy postulates hardly impress most real scientists.

Additional question: I've always liked the idea of of taxing salaries and stock sales of 100-millionaires and above at very steep rates.  My rationale is that commit that you achieve diminishing returns if you pay a CEO an extra 5 million if he's already making 5 million.  It's not like the CEO will work twice as much for twice the pay.  Also, it seems that people end up fetishizing wealth because it increases their relative social status, rather than absolute material status.  It therefore seems that very progressive taxes are the best way to to get the most bang for your buck from uber-elites.  Your thoughts on this perspective?","1262313499"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I understand all too well the bond between a guy and his dog, but it was just as much hers. OP says as much himself:

&gt;It has since been our dog, always been with her.

He also mentioned that she was tired of cleaning up after the dog. He fails to mention that he has ever had to do it.

We only have his side of the story, and what he omits from his side of the story is as important as what he chooses to include. Even from his version of events he doesn't sound like a very great husband, dog-owner, or human being. 

Who lets a dog get to the point where it's shitting all over the home, puking up every bite it eats, without even considering a vet? He never mentions what the vet's recommendation is, does he? Wonder why?

&gt;If she was tired of cleaning up after the dog and it was seriously threatening her ability to be happy in the relationship, then she should have left.

Yes, this is how adults should deal with their problems. Really? How about trying to talk to him about it? Oh, that's what she did. And did allow any sort of discourse on the issue? No, he told her flat out he chose the dog over her. End of discussion.

&gt;Taking it upon herself to make that decision for him is a cowards way out.

My impression is that the OP is weak and can't make a touch decision. He is probably the type who, even into adulthood, whines like a little school-girl when he doesn't get his way. She probably saved him a ton of embarrassment by not making that phone call. 

However, she should have called him anyway. Was it ""incoherently selfish""? Fuck no. It was a tough decision she had to make in the first place. It was her family member too. And she probably saw the suffering this poor dog was going through with clearer eyes than OP did. Dragging him there could have caused more emotional pain for both of them. That's about the best defense I can muster, but I agree that she should have tried to contact him at work.

&gt;I don't care if she spent the last 14 years on her hands and knees cleaning vomit from the carpet.

The problem with Reddit is that the Reddiquette is a stupid wiki that anyone can change at any time.  It changes constantly, and there is no notification to the community when it does.

I agree with what I believe is your central premise: rules are too vague in general, and too much is left to the discretion of the moderators.  Mass down-voting is pretty obviously douchebaggery, but karma parties - not so much.

Personally, I think the Reddiquette needs to be standardized, locked down (no more wiki), and users should be notified when terms of use change.

As far as infant mortality and home births go, it doesn't look like there is much of a difference between hospital and home births. It's just a matter of whether or not you are willing to take the pain. 


wiki:

Infant safety
Perinatal outcome is more complicated to assess due to the low incidence of mortality and the subjectivity of Apgar scoring. Most studies found a slight, but statistically significant, difference in Apgar score for infants at five minutes. However, the 1994 UK National Birthday Trust study found a slight advantage for home birthed infants at one minute and no difference at five minutes [20]. No cohort study has conducted long-term follow up on the infants. The perinatal mortality figure still remains controversial. The Zurich study[19] showed an equal perinatal death rate between the home birth group and the hospital birth group (2.3 / 1000), and the Birthday Trust study found a slightly higher perinatal death rate in the hospital birth group (1 / 1000 vs. 0.8/1000) [20]. However, two other studies [18] [21] did find a slightly higher perinatal mortality in the home birth group as compared to the hospital birth group. None of these results were seen to be statistically significant, since the actual mortality rate and the sample sizes were both so low, these figures have been the subject of much debate regarding the relative safety of home birth compared to hospital birth


Most of the studies I found argued against home births, but I am not positive that they are taking unassisted births into account rather than just the midwife births.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Something that I've always wondered is why it's so difficult to write a masterpiece. Lets take albums for example. Tons of people write albums, thousands come out every year. But only a few are considered masterpieces, in a sea of filth. Why is it that *good* art is so hard to come by? What is stopping everyone from going out and writing a masterpiece album?

One possible reason is that we define art as a pursuit in which most people will fail. There are lots of things that humans do that we succeed perfectly every almost every time, like walking or being able to say words. However, this is kind of circular, since it still provokes the question of why certain things are difficult to master.

Another thing that I like to think about is why certain problems are easy to solve and other ones are difficult. Incidentally, this is why I think that computer science is awesome. ","1262313681"

I think it's important that the guilty have rights; that's the cost we pay to make sure that the innocent are not punished. So when we give the impression that it's okay to do away with some rights when we *know* that the person is guilty, I'm afraid that sets a dangerous precedent.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;I am mystified by the Austrian school and their artificial distinction between markets and government.

We see basically no distinction. What makes the classes ""government"" and ""citizenry"" distinct is that the individuals in the ""government"" group are recognized as such by both groups. Thus, in a throng of _individuals_, we call it a ""government"", because that throng calls it government. This is _precisely_ why we see no difference between taxation and robbery - both involve a distant man attempting to take your stuff. That one of those men calls himself ""the government"" means little to me.

&gt;My first job after college was at a mega-corporation's campus. To me, that campus felt like a barony. They were the local government. What makes the motives of a business owner any purer than that of an elected representative?

Very good question! Most big companies do indeed operate like a local government, and it is important to note the above when understanding why governments (and therefore any group of individuals) tend to look just like any other organization. The key difference is of course, _coercion_.

Let us think of two groups of individuals, one slightly larger than the other. Let us suppose the larger group enacts a rule wherein the members of the small group must never be over 200lbs by punishment of death. We would call this a ""law"" and the group a ""government"" because they used coercion to achieve their task.

So what is the difference between an elected official and a business owner? Firstly, the government official doesn't have to worry about going out of business. If there is a mistake in government, well fire he who erred. If the government is short on money, well go collect more from the tax payers - after all they _have_ to pay. If it's the leaders fault himself, he can just lie. If a business owner however cannot pay his bills - he is prevented from _robbing_ people to continue doing business. He is therefore at the whim of the consumer. Typically where one sees business looking like bureaucracy, one also sees business doing public sector work. These two go along because typically overly bureaucratic slow and unprofitable companies are replaced quite quickly by a new entrepreneur. Conversely, where one sees massive innovation, speed and reliability, one sees freedom. There is no better example of that than the internet.

&gt;They both have constituents

But only one can shoot and/or imprison said constituents.

&gt;they both adhere (or fail to adhere) to a set of agreed upon rules of conduct

But only one can shoot and/or imprison said constituents if they get mad at him for failing the rules. The other is simply a poorer man with a bad investment under his belt.

&gt;and they both can be greedy or power hungry.

I agree here of course. I do not (in strict economic language) believe in greed or altruism. Man acts to increase his own happiness. If happy for a man is robbing the poor or feeding starving children, then so be it. Both these activities, in a economic sense, are equally greedy and altruistic (these terms being meaningless in the science). I want to point out that ""order"" as opposed to ""law"" is when human beings understand that association and cooperation (ie: kindness) is more _worldly profitable_. People who think cruelty will bring them happiness are called ""crazy"" and are typically honestly psychotic, or in need of a good liberal education. Therefore, order is everywhere humans are. Order is what makes topics taboo, it is what makes everyone defend innocent children. Order is a zeitgeist on the human species - law is simply armed men demanding things from other men.

&gt;Why is gold better than bank notes?

Because I don't have to tell you about the United States to sell you gold. Because someone can't just _make_ gold (the math of why printing money is exactly equal to taxing money is too in depth to show here). In a world without the State, bank notes would be _better_ than gold, that is, they would be light and redeemable. As it stands, Government Money is simply a way of taxing you without having to hike up the tax rate.

&gt;Should I be able to use gold pieces from World of Warcraft at the mall?

Interesting question - but the answer is ""yes and no"". Malls should certainly be allowed to accept anything they desire, digital or no, and people should certainly be allowed to sell anything they desire, digital or no. However, because Blizzard can just ""make"" (ie: spawn) 5,000 gold coins, I doubt GE will be investing in them (and now you see the problem with the government currency I hope).

&gt;If we had no federal reserve, wouldn't the banks get together to create one?

Each bank would be it's own reserve, yes, and it would be _wonderful_. The tacky ""FDIC INSURED"" stickers will peel away, replaced by big gold statues proclaiming ""5,000 tonnes in our reserve!"". People would _research_ their banking products (because they are no longer being coddled), and the entirety of the economic disaster would have been avoided.

__TL:DR;__ 1) Profit-motive and risk of job-loss, 2) yes but only the businessman constituents are 100% voluntary, 3) yes but only one has real consequences, 4) yes, because greed is an illusion, 5) because noone can print gold, 6) yea, probably, though they'd prolly be worth next to nothing, 7) No, they would be forced to be honest. They would be _free_.","1262313842"

I don't believe it impossible though to talk about the subject of religion in public schools, my point was just that we do have religion classes in Irish public schools and my experience was that the best teacher I ever had in this subject was an atheist science teacher. He just had a really good knowledge of all different religions from Hinduism, Muslism, Judahism, Buddism and Christianity. He also spoke about atheism, satanism, wicha and of course his personal belief science. I really just meant the whole point of the original comment as the contrast between my atheist religion teacher and this monster of a bible bashing so-called science teacher. But I love the debate and think it's what makes atheism great, the ability to accept all the ideas with respect weither we agree or not. Happy new year ","1262313903"

"science","t5_mouw","A theory that has been around for years is straightforward:  that what we think of as intelligence, or more, a specialized subset of intelligence that lends itself to the use of abstracts in thought, is a recessive mutation.  More so, that intellectualism and autism are two types of the same thing.

There is a more recent process for divining this that is intriguing in its own right.  It is the idea that a normal person is able to have a deeply focused, or deeply unfocused, state of mind.  In the former state, one would seem to be intellectual, because you could focus on a problem for a long time to solve it without distraction.  In an unfocused state of mind, a person could be very artistic, and draw great inspiration out of their nebulous subconscious, again without distraction.

However, in mankind's ancient past, we figured out that neither state of mind, either focused or unfocused, is conducive to survival.  So as a species we developed the technique of talking to ourselves, that makes our attention vacillate between the two states.  A protective mechanism which we still use today, and unconsciously teach to our children, even though we are seldom in a survival situation.

But people who are unable to properly talk to themselves might get stuck in either a focused state, like someone with Asperger's Syndrome; or an unfocused state, like Autism.","1262313977"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Well, hypothetically, if you are getting ""friend zoned"" by girls, then you probably have a few female friends. I'd recommend starting by gathering up your courage and asking a few of them, ""Please be brutally honest: What are the exact reasons you see me as friend material but not as boyfriend material?""

A few, rather than just one, because some of them will just say ""I don't know"" or ""I just don't see you that way,"" but ask enough female friends and you're likely to find one who will actually level with you if you smell funky or come off as a wimp when you ask people out.

Or you could try something like speed dating as a rapid self-audit to find out what type of girls are and aren't interested in you after a first encounter. If none of them are you've probably got a major hygiene, appearance or personality issue. If many of them are, you're probably attractive and fun to meet at first but you don't express interest clearly and early enough when dating. If only a few of them are, try to think of a common trait among the girls who were into you and those who weren't, and ask yourself why that type likes you or the other type doesn't.

If you are moderately attractive, have decent hygiene, dress decently and aren't an utter bore or an insufferable asshole, the problem is likely to be just that you're not approaching enough women in person (online doesn't count--you will often get lost in the flood when messaging any attractive girl on dating sites, no matter what you do) or that when you do approach a woman you don't make your interest clear enough.","1262313987"

What do you know about communism?  Have you ever even heard of Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels or do you base your over the top assumptions on Maoist China and Stalinist Russia?  If you do, there is your first problem, neither China, nor the USSR were ever communist.  


The very definition of real communism would mean there would be no need to fight a war over resources or greed.  

Communism is a system set up to get rid of ALL social divides starting with removing the very institution that divides society, the state.


Communists have never fought wars and were never greedy because, in reality, there were never even real communist countries.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","A few thoughts about this post:

1. Go back to school. The degree from a non-regionally accredited school will hurt you in the long run. I'm really, really, really, really sorry that you ended up there, and wish there was something that could be said to be more encouraging than this - but you have plenty of life yet to live. Don't let that degree hold you back.

2. If you are a fundamentalist, understand that all that will ever have to happen for your life to be royally schrewed up is a single power-hungry pastor who feels threatend by your success. ""I just don't think this is the person God has for us"" and you are on the street. Just like that. There are no safeguards, there are no replays, there is no justice in this world. 

3. Start attending the sort of church in which you wish to work. If there's not one nearby, move. You can get a retailish job anywhere.

4. Volunteer in that church's youth &amp; children ministry. No one wants to work with middle school students, so you can start there.

5. Develop the senior pastor as a cheif mentor, and the youth pastor as another sort of mentor.

6. Keep working on that degree from an accredited school. Once you've gotten that degree, go to seminary and get a MA in religious studies. You can get a MA at around 32-36 credit hours, as opposed to the 90 hour masters of divinity. 

7. When things are ready, you'll get a job in a church similar to the one you're attending, probably as a youth pastor. This is key. Big churches hire ppl from other big churches. Rarely do ppl make huge jumps upward in church hiring. Better to volunteer at a big church and move frmo there than try to move up from a small church.

8. Keep growing in faith and knowledge and love. Love most of all. ","1262314028"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Man I don't care if I have to stoop down to the fundie level and wish a speedy demise of Limbaugh's health. That guy is a cancer to the American society and the world would be far better off without his hatred spewing over the radios. I would have wished Hitler dead before he waged war as well, but sure everything is easier to judge in retrospect and I think Rush has done enough harm already to warrant my ill feelings of the past and of the future. 

I got no problem with someone being put out of their position in doing any more harm, but unlike the murderer, Limbaugh's problem cannot be rehabilitated, and it is likely that he is deliberately stirring up hatred for the sake of hatred. Sure, it would be more preferential that he lost his mind or at least lost his voice but I don't think that would be enough to stop his influence on the susceptible fundie mind, whom may even follow the warped views of a stroke victim. 

In conclusion, the difference is that my disgust, for Limbaugh, is not rooting from a false and delusional mindset, like the fundy's prayer-killing views for Obama. Another difference is that I don't wish anyone to actively put Limbaugh into harm's way, unlike many wishes of the far right.","1262314064"

"programming","t5_2fwo","The same like placing objects from classes in lists, only with functions / functionality instead. Lisp and other functional languages (or generally languages with first-class functions) use that pretty often. Same with other non-standard imperative / oo stuff, like closures. Plus, if you want to, you could define a class which defines \_\_call\_\_() and put it in, thereby having more potential while being able to use functions for the simpler stuff. Also, using functions carries a different meaning than directly using classes as defined above, you're pretty much saying that you want such a list as a list of things which represent simple code, not full-blown objects which could do anything. One example of the top of my head: Say you want to parse a text with regex and you know for sure that a. the text is easy to parse (But this is given since I said that you will use regex, so I mean here ""no structures which may contain themselves"") b. you will parse line-oriented with no modifications through context and c you don't need to alter this simple format to some more complex one and the parser should parse in a lazy way. Simple way to implement something like this:

    import re
    
    def my_parser(file_object, re_to_changers):
        for line in file_object:
            line = line.strip()
            for pattern in re_to_changers:
                m = re.match(pattern, line):
                if m is not None:
                     yield re_to_changers[pattern](line, pattern)
                else:
                     yield line

     print ""\n"".join(my_parser(..., {""\d+?"": lambda line, pattern: ...})

The popular music of mainstream young people each decade is only a smidgen of the music that people listened too.  Just as they are only a smidgen of the people living each decade.  They count for something but it is erroneous to classify a decade based on such a small niche.

Well I'm not, but the realizations of a seemingly simple idea certainly made me think deeper of myself, those around me, and the horrible generalization of ""the world"".


Try to imagine reality is all a dream created by you. Now you might take that 5 seconds and think ""haha stupid idea"", but what if you actually believed it? What if you thought for 5 minutes that this was a game, a joke, a safety zone for yourself. Everyone you ever knew wasn't real and everything you knew was...you. 


There's tons of ways to justify anything once you think like this. There's much circular reasoning in this new reality so there is no way to refute it. Some might say there is but a true solipsist cannot be refuted. It's very rational and extremely funny and terrifying but it's just a thought and a mind frame to throw you into a surprisingly real universe.

The bomber didn't have a passport from what he overheard but the Indian man noted the bomber is from Sudan and they do this all the time.

Assuming this is all true and Kurt overheard it all accurately, so far facts are:

* Crotch bomber got on w/o a passport
* Someone helped him at Amsterdam and this someone is involved with airport security there

Past the facts, fiction:

* The Indian guy works for CIA (he could as well have been on Al-Qaeda's payroll)
* FBI completely ignored all of this (which goes even against what Kurt says)

There is your problem, and the source of your unhappiness.  Even if you throw logic to the wind and adopt some dogma to try and remedy your fear I'll wager that it will not work, as you seem smart enough to know its all nonsense.

Here's the thing - you are going to die. I am going to die.  Your friends are going to die. Your parents, if not already dead, are going to die.  There is nothing wrong with this.  This isn't scary or terrifying at all.  We are extremely complex structures in a universe heading towards disorder - loss of order, and the life it sustains, is inevitable. 

The atoms that provide structure to our bodies were formed by the deaths of stars - what makes us humans expect that we could escape a similar fate? The sooner we can all learn to celebrate the experiences we have had with others and accept life as a continuing series of meetings and partings (ending with our own parting), the better.

My best recommendation to you is to develop a sense of spirituality - and no this does not require believing in bullshit.  What we have discovered so far scientifically supports a feeling of oneness with everything that no dogma can match.  Personally I found that understanding my place in the cosmos, and the deep connection that we all have to it has removed any fear of death I once had.

If you still find yourself getting depressed, feeling anxious or whatever - try meditation.  There are several studies suggesting that meditation really can alter traits we long thought hardwired.  If you want to know more about this, just look up the work of University of Wisconsin's  Richard Davidson, an expert on the neuroscience of emotion, and his joint experiments with University of Massachusetts's Jon Kabat-Zinn on mindfulness meditation.","1262314367"

I think both views stem from a common misconception about what philosophy actually *is*. On the one hand you have people thinking its all about asking open questions without really seeking answers and on the other you have people who think it's all about mind-blowingly complicated conceptual thought. Whilst it certainly isn't the former, it need not be the latter (at least until you're suitably learned) either. I don't think it requires a large vocabulary, nor spectacular speaking skills (at least no more than any other subject that requires you to read a lot) just a keen, analytical mind.

I first discovered philosophy thanks to a series of programmes (and an accompanying book) by [Alain de Botton](http://www.alaindebotton.com/) on happiness. I decided to take it as an option for my a-levels and was introduced to my first ""real"" bit of philosophy (Language, Truth and Logic -Ayer) by my teacher. 

If platonic dialogues aren't for you, don't be put off. Some really good introductory books are: The problems of philosophy by Bertrand Russell, What does it all mean? by Thomas Nagel and Morality by Bernard Williams. All of them are short, concise and eminently readable (should limit those headaches!). Really though, find something that interests you and go from there. I believe someone has already mentionned the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/), which is a really fantastic resource (contributed to by some very well renowned philosophers). I know i've pimped it on here before on possibly more than one occasion. Also Philosophy 1 and 2 (ed. Grayling) are really good overviews to help you find your way.

Definitely research the neuropsychologist's credentials and/or ask him or her about his or her training and approach during your first meeting with them. They should be more than happy to discuss this. Also, ask questions about what you will learn from the evaluation and how it will be helpful. I like to talk with families about how I think I can help, and also what type of things I probably won't be able to help with. 

If there is not a ""pressing"" issue - e.g., you're worried your toddler has autism - I like to wait until children are about 6 or 7 before I do an evaluation. The tests that are available for children 6 and up, and the child's ability to participate in testing, are leaps and bounds above what I can do when the child is 4 or 5. A lot of this is because children develop better ""work"" skills during school, so they get the idea of what I'm asking them to do in an evaluation. At age 4-5 or younger, I can do some testing, but a lot of what I do is play with the kid, and observe them, and get parent report, so a lot more of my ""gut feeling"" goes into an evaluation of a young child.","1262314443"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was trying to visualize a multiverse as a three-dimensional model.  I imagined a point on a 3D graph representing a single configuration (universe) at an arbitrary point in time.  From this point, I could pick a direction and move an arbitrary distance away.  This distance represents a step forward in time.  If I were to plot all of the possible points extending one step outward from the origin, I'd have a sphere.  All of the points on the surface of this sphere would then represent different configurations.  If I extend another time-unit away from the origin I'd have another, larger sphere.

The distance between two points on the surface of the sphere could represent the level of disparity between those two configurations.  That is, similar configurations are closer together, while wildly different configurations are much further apart.

Moving from a particular sphere to the next larger sphere in a straight line (according to both spheres' shared center) would represent the simplest transition from one configuration to another.  Moving in any other direction between spheres would represent a more complex transition.

How limited are our transitions?  Imagine a plane created tangent to a point on the sphere.  Now imagine the next larger sphere.  The tangent plane would intersect that larger sphere and cut a small dome out of it.  We might be able to move to a point on that dome, but to move to a point on the rest of the sphere would mean heading back toward the center, or going back in time.

Also, are we moving in winding paths between shells, making decisions that move us to different positions on each shell's surface, or are we moving in a straight line through shells that have been rotated?","1262314528"

All the sequels involved the devs attempting to simply dress up the 'base' version of the game, with no thought to the modability. The latest entry in the Tribes franchise (Tribes: Vengenace) was a complete failure. 

Basically, even in the unlikely scenario that full scale development was to begin on a Tribes game, it would most likely still fail to capture the aspects of the original that made it such a good game with incredible longevity.","1262314557"

"Health","t5_2qh9z","The linked article suggests ways to prevent chronic headache; I want to comment on each suggested way.

**Be Mindful of Dietary Choices** — I don't think this suggestion is helpful. Dietary exclusion is not an effective approach to headache and migraine. And no food has ever been demonstrated to cause, trigger, promote, or aggravate primary headache including migraine.

**Stay Hydrated with Plenty of Water** — I don't believe dehydration is involved with chronic headache or with other primary headaches including migraine.

**Break the Patterns of Stress** — Stress doesn't even exist, much less cause headaches. I think people have mistaken caffeine-caused anxiety for ""stress."" Caffeine exists and is a demonstrated cause of headache; ""stress"" doesn't even exist.

**Take deep breaths** — I think this could be helpful advice, as a shortage of oxygen would tend to promote and aggravate headache. Breath holding or shallow breathing could worsen a headache. Oxygen has been used to relieve severe headaches.

**Get sufficient sleep** — I think this advice is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between sleep and migraine. The author, Dr. Mark Wiley, mentions that caffeine can cause insomnia, but doesn't mention it can also cause headache. Caffeine is the factor underlying the association between insomnia and headache.

**Engage in regular exercise** — I can't argue with that. Might even improve your headache condition. Can't hurt. Of course some people get ""exertion"" headaches: headaches induced by exercise. Seems likely hypoxia (shortage of oxygen) contributes to such headaches.

**Know your number** — by which Dr. Wiley means the ""trigger threshold"" theory: the idea that trigger factors add up to produce a headache. Dr. Wiley says he drinks coffee, which contains caffeine, a drug demonstrated to cause headache. It is unwise for anybody bothered by headaches to use a recreational drug that causes headaches. Instead of keeping track of factors never demonstrated to cause or trigger a headache, Dr. Wiley would be better advised to quit using caffeine.

The Empty Child / Doctor Dances and Blink especially are amoung the best sci-fi TV ever made.

The series has been patchy so far (I'm not over the moon with the head writer / producer Russel T Davies, great set pieces but his endings leave a lot to be desired). But you will not regret watching the eps listed above, Moffat is brilliant.

However the 'u' sound is definitely not the same. I recommend nemetroid's explanation but the Spanish 'u' is stronger, in my subjective opinion and is articulated in a different place, not just the lips. The other hard to pronounce thing is the 'f' which is tough to keep separate from Spanish 'f' and English 'h'. To a lesser degree 'hi' is also pronounced differently. Also the 'r' is not quite the same thing sometimes. But it's true that my pronunciation was better a lot faster than most anglophones (or francophones) in my class.","1262314817"

Also, she was wearing wooden Japanese clogged sandals with socks, although she removed her shoes before the battle began and fought in her white socks.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","You draw attention to a few of the flaws in your post preemptively, essentially lampshading them.  Your awareness of them doesn't erase them, however.  

For instance, you admit you can't speak for Aerik, but your viewpoint is far more reasonable (and somewhat closer to my own) than Aerik's ever will be.  You claim I misread him, but you haven't seen how reactionary, how reductionist he can actually be.  It's unreasonable for you to project your own, more eloquent viewpoint on his ""bumper sticker"" and portray me as opposing it.

You also bring up the brevity of Aerik's post, and use it to defend him.  You use the relative brevity of your own post to defend yourself, as well, noting that the issues are too complex for you to address fully.  Your post dwarfs mine, but you refuse to give mine the benefit of the doubt in any instance.  

Essentially, you outright asked me for a consideration that you don't give in return.  Don't you see how inconsistent it is for you to assume I think societal constructs spring magically out of thin air, simply because I reference them without taking the time to share my theory on their extremely complex interconnected causes?

Finally, you quote my opening sentence without noting the context.  The entire opening sentence is an *example* of a fallacious argument, and the supposed weakness you find in it is actually part of my point.  For someone who scried the guts of Aerik's post for meaning that I've reason to believe doesn't exist, you seem relatively oblivious to the overt meaning of my post.

The Earth, along with any proof of my existence, itself will be engulfed in the flames of a swelling Sun. Not only that, the entire universe will eventually peter out into heat death (or rebound into another universe. I'm not sure what the current cosmological model suggests.). Eventually, though, I cast off these thoughts to the side. It doesn't seem sane to plan my life around what will happen billions of years from now. I live my life and enjoy it, because ultimately, nothing matters. I try to be as good a person as I can be to myself and to everyone, because this is our one shot at being alive.

I remember reading about the afterlife in The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan. There, Sagan writes of J.B.S. Haldane's suggestion of the possibility of being alive again if we do live in a universe that cyclically collapses into itself to cause another big bang. He says that there could be a universe where you and I are alive again, fully recalling our past memories, in the company of the family and friends we've lost already in this world. Now, that screams religious wishful thinking, but I don't dismiss it offhand. It at least has scientific basis. I don't plan on it being a sure thing, but it would be nice if we could have another go.

Does that diminish the value of this life? I think not. Humanism teaches us that life is only what we make (of) it, and for me, life is wonderful.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;On your first point, don't the Scandinavian countries, which tend to have higher per capita incomes (with a more equitable distribution), kill and rape each other less, and tend to be generally happier than the United States (despite a much more interventionist government) cast some doubt on the thinking that Government Intervention in the economy necessarily damages a country and damages society?

Well that's a tough one, but no. Surprisingly, I would call the United States the most interventionist first world nation on Earth. Far far more interventionist than any Scandinavian countries. There is a tendency to think we libertarians are simply against welfare - we are also (and doubly so) against _warfare_, which is intervention writ large. People may point to Sweden and Canada and say ""but they are _much more socialist!_"", but they miss the point that neither of those nations are _occupying another nation_, not to mention _two_! I would say, as far as their interventions go, Sweden and Canada (the famous examples of single-payer) are still on the gold bit of their path to hell (I mean this figuratively :D)

Let me put it another way - if we withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan and traded it for single-payer health-care, we would be _much_ better off. Still not as good, however, as not intervening in either.

I just read up on Tulip Mania, and spotted this gem (I do not know the validity of either the Mania or the Legal Changes):

&gt;On February 24, 1637, the self-regulating guild of Dutch florists, in a decision that was later ratified by the Dutch Parliament, announced that all futures contracts written after November 30, 1636 and before the re-opening of the cash market in the early Spring, were to be interpreted as option contracts. They did this by simply relieving the futures buyers of the obligation to buy the future tulips, forcing them merely to compensate the sellers with a small fixed percentage of the contract price.[42]

Sounds to me like the government had its hands deep in this market. Futures trading, by the way, is an overly simplified way of saying _they were leveraging to the hilt_. In fact, this sounds like outright price fixing, but as I said, I don't know too much about this event, so I won't say more than that __it was in no way a completely free-market effect__. That contracts were being rewritten by parliament is proof enough for me.

That said, _speculation_ is still of course the only tool investors have at their disposal, and many people trying to buy one thing _will most likely_ result in a very expensive purchase. That supply and demand exist is not refuted by Austrians - we simply add in that the _information_ in the market can be _abstracted_, either by the printing of money, or the implicit guarantee of government action. This abstraction is what causes business cycles.

&gt;What evidence is there that a privately managed currency wouldn't be subject to those same animal spirits? What recourse would the public have if the managers of a privately managed currency or currency system act unscrupulously and tank the currency?

Here again people tend to see 5% of the Austrian view and ignore the rest. The government does not even have to touch the money supply to create bubbles - they can do that with force or with promises too. Privately managed currencies _are_ subject to the same ""animal spirits"", however, they are forced to compete with other currencies, rather than the de-fact-o forced currency for most of the modern world.

&gt;Furthermore, there were plenty of non-Austrian economists who correctly predicted the crash.

Like whom? Did they connect the NASDAQ bubble with the dotcom bubble, did they see the pattern in housing as well as in financial securities? Can they give a systemic rundown of the fundamental conditions of our crash, or do they blame ""greed""? Did they call it _before_ 2006?

&gt;The problem is that the jackasses in charge listened to the chowder heads who said what their bosses wanted to hear in order to get and keep those cushy political jobs.

I honestly think it's a deeper problem than that. I get the feeling it's not just some nerdy Keynesian guy anymore - I get the feeling most people (especially in the senate) simply think the government's job is to spend money and to create jobs. Obama talks about honest wealth, about paying back debt, about an honest economy... Then he goes and creates ""make-work"" programs. I've always said, the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and I think even Bernanke thinks he's helping.

&gt;We just need a referee.

I am no anarchist, and I do see the need for a government to protect property, contract rights, life, and defense from foreign invasion. However, I will never stop complaining while the Ref carries a Gun and gets to add extra rounds all willy-nilly :-D","1262315477"

Not really. The eviction for the little girl and foster care consequence is the crux of the case.

Out of all the people I've spoken to on Reddit I've rarely encountered such a thoughtful deconstruction of my words and I thank you.

For what it's worth, my bad. I misread the tone of your post. It *appeared* you were trying to say that misogyny was unrelated to the gender issues men face but your response combined with a re-reading of your original post does show I was wrong in that presumption, so, sorry.

That said...

&gt;You also bring up the brevity of Aerik's post, and use it to defend him.

I wasn't defending him with the post's brevity, rather I was defending the essential idea that I got out of the post while saying that such a thesis- expressed so simply- can be misinterpreted. If anything I was kind of chiding him for the succinctness of his post.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I wouldn't have a problem with removing the downmod button from user's profile page, for example. But it opens up a number of questions:

-suppose you get flamed by a nasty troll. you check his comment page, and see he's making nasty, racist comments to a lot of people. As a reddityor concerned about the site, you downvote the offensive comments you see, because you truly believe that they're detrimental to the site. Is that bad? Should it be forbidden?

-suppose that issue is solved by making those downvotes public. By the same logic, should all downvotes be public? Should privacy on it be forbidden?

The typical answer on the web is moderators make the judgments, and the site becomes a game of wack-a-mole. A small group of admins call the shots, and either most people like it, or they don't. Endless bitching ensues.

Here's the answer I come up with to that myriad of questions, based on how I've seen reddit work all this time: err on the side of letting people make their own decisions and do as they wish. We tend to focus on the outliers, the few total assholes that abuse the system. What that ignores is that for the most part the system works great. Of *course* 1% of your users will be bad apples. Let it go. For all the bitching, I don't think any site deals with trolls better than reddit in its current form.

I think that the type of person who would do that would have to have been morally desensitized throughout their life, probably had a messed up childhood and some mental issues, and feels that other people don't deserve to live for whatever reason. They feel no moral obligation for killing people. They usually won't kill themselves though, they'd be what you'd call a serial killer.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Well I must compliment you -- you have put your finger on a vital question.

I agree with you generally.  But in what way are the people at fault?  Not so much the anti-intellectualism, is it, altho that's a part.  But Americans have always had a healthy pioneering no-BS kind of smarts, which is good.  We still innovate too.

Myself, I think Americans have lost their self-respect, because their govt is extraordinarily corrupt.  There is no longer any meaning in practice to law, or the Constitution.  Politics has become an overtly corrupt exercise, but not a game -- the corruption is literally killing us, spending us into oblivion, siphoning our resources to the privileged and connected, building bloated and incredibly stupid mechanisms into our daily lives.  (And I would have supported real health reform, maybe even single-payer if well done and Constitutionally grounded, but not this ungodly crapola).

I know it's a trivial example, but the cops tasering people is an example -- Americans will put up with shit b/c they've lost self-respect b/c their Constitution means nothing.  I find that average people get this very well 1-1, but are mindlessly unable to do anything about it en masse.

Perhaps our media is complicit and at fault too.  The MSM and cable news are so horrific, it is obvious that we are in Brave New World.  They are a means of social control that extends the insider control which is founded on govt corruption.

But then again, people watch Hollywood Insider or whatever that crap is called nowadays.  And follow celebs on twitter.  That's pretty shitty stupid.  So maybe it's just that.  :(

I was deeply disappointed that the ""bad guys"" didn't get any sort of social justice for their actions. For them to just die along with all the evidence of their misconduct doesn't seem fair (but then again, life rarely is).

Personally I think theists are walking around with blindfolds on, and missing a lot. I wouldn't want to be them. But I can see how it might be almost worth it, if it also gave you unshakable certainty that your life meant something, and that it would all work out in the end, because the Creator of the Universe had a special plan just for you.

I think atheism means owning up to your own insignificance, and that there is a very strong chance that everything WON'T be alright. We're here on our own; no one will solve it for us.

We could still have a nuclear war tomorrow and wipe out every intelligent being on the planet. We could ruin the world with pollution. And closer to home... maybe I will never find love, or be truly happy. Maybe we're all deluding ourselves that we're even capable of higher things. Maybe we're just meat robots running some buggy program from the Neolithic era.

This is why I don't believe in God, but I do believe in faith. I think it's important to have some unjustified -- maybe even irrational -- beliefs that we can make it all work despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.","1262315880"

&gt;the Apollo guidance computer led and motivated the integrated-circuit technology

While that statement is short (and not quite correct), it does reflect a larger reality.  The idea of integrated circuits had been around for awhile, and indeed TI and Fairchild Micrologic had some very smart men who figured out how to make them and thus were manufacturing them.  However, cost were *much* higher and raw performance somewhat lower than using conventional transistors and so their market was very small.  The major place where their lower power usage justified the high costs/the place where cost wasn't much of a concern compared to overcoming engineering problems was NASA. The AGC, which was by far the most significant early IC-based computer, required over 4,000 integrated circuits (each only contained a few transistors) making NASA the largest buyer of ICs through the mid 60's.  While the eventual development of IC computers was probably inevitable, NASA's funding allowed them to make it practical about a decade or so before it would have otherwise been.  The push toward IC dev lead to the creation of more and more complex integrated circuits eventually leading to modern single chip micro-controllers and processors.","1262315964"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The easiest answer is probably to say ""in our frontal lobes."" Motor planning happens in your motor planning areas, which are in the frontal lobes. I hope you don't mind if I cannibalize this from an earlier response: 

* Your brain has four ""lobes"" - the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes, which very basically handle vision, touch/sensation, and hearing, respectively - and the frontal lobe, which takes care of planning, organizing, and executing your behaviors, thoughts, and emotions. In other words, you have three lobes which take care of sensory input, and one lobe that helps you organize your output (the things you do).

* The frontal lobe works in collaboration with a group of structures called the striatum - which includes structures such as the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are in charge of ""learning"" the motor plans that your frontal lobe comes up with and helping make them automatic. You know how sometimes things feel effortful and you can feel yourself thinking, while other times you do things on autopilot? When you can feel yourself thinking, that's the frontal lobe planning. When you're doing something familiar on autopilot (like when you miss your exit when you're driving to work), that's when your basal ganglia is in charge.

So, if you ""feel"" yourself thinking, it's probably happening in your frontal lobes.","1262315986"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I wrote my own big integer library (in C) to get started on Project Euler (mostly just for fun). The big integer type is actually just an array of chars, the first element of which lists the size of the array (allowing for 254-digit numbers, though you could easily modify the type to make it bigger). The rest of the elements are just the digits of the number in reverse order.

For instance, the number 3,555,123 can be visualized as

[7][3][2][1][5][5][5][3][0][0][0] . . . [0]

All of my algorithms for operations are based on the way we learned arithmetic in grade school (think about writing out by hand, carrying numbers, etc.)

For most purposes, it works to use a pre-existing library, but if you're curious about implementing your own (or want a limited-functionalty but easily-understood alternative) let me know!","1262316063"

turns out he's a cousin of mine, thus the same name, it's a family name.

Freaked out an ex gf in highschool like that too.  my great grandfather had the same name I have, and my great grandmother had the same name as my then gf.

"reddit.com","t5_6","""Antimicrobial drugs encourage the overgrowth of organisms resistant to the agents used. Acquisition and subsequent overgrowth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are particularly associated with β-lactam antibiotics and quinolones. These drugs allow rapid proliferation of an organism that might have been merely colonizing the skin, leading to clinical infection, treatment difficulties and potential transmission to others. In addition, there is increasing evidence that inappropriate antibiotics not only encourage overgrowth with MRSA but may also enhance pathogenicity. Such virulence is not necessarily due to simple expansion of MRSA across skin and mucosal surfaces; there appear to be molecular changes that facilitate mechanisms such as quorum sensing, adhesion, phage mobilization, exotoxin production, intracellular persistence and biofilm formation, all of which contribute towards more severe infection. This review examines the association between MRSA and certain classes of antibiotics and explores the molecular mechanisms underlying a perceived increase in virulence following inappropriate therapy. It is possible that empirical prescribing has a significant impact on the management of MRSA infections and ultimately patient outcome. It is time to challenge the prescribers’ right to prescribe what they like, when they like, for patients at risk of MRSA.""

Romans 15

3 For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: ""The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.""[a] 4 For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.

[a] Psalm 69:9

""Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us""? Well, sure. OK. Great. But what about the recently concluded life of Jesus!?!?! Wouldn't this have been a perfect opportunity for Paul to remind the faithful of how Jesus had patiently endured the jeers and insults of the centurions and Jews during his arrest, trial and crucifixion? Instead Paul refers to Psalms 69:9 and doesn't even say that Psalms 69:9 is a prophecy recently fulfilled. It's almost as though Paul is saying the gospel account or evidence of the crucifixion and resurrection is hidden in or completely contained in the Old Testament - that it all happend sometime in the distant past or from the foundation of the world. This is also implied in the following passages...

Ephesians 3

4 In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5 which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been **revealed by the Spirit** to God's holy apostles and prophets.

Revealed by the Spirit? In the writings of Paul wasn't anything revealed by the recently concluded life of Jesus?

and...

Ephesians 3

9 to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 10 His intent was that now, **through the church**, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,

Made known through the church? In the writings of Paul wasn't anything made known through the recently completed life of Jesus?

Romans 15:4 concludes with, 

""And through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope?"" 

How about hope and encouragement through the life and teachings of Christ? Why does Paul never share any examples from the life of Christ?

Buckethead is simply one of the great guitarists of the last 30 years and actually released a staggering 50+ CDs in the decade, including over 20 CDs in 2007 (I think it was '07). He was also involved in perhaps the best concert of the decade, Praxis at Bonnaroo in 2004.

Doc Watson continues to be perform at an extremely high level into his 80's. Very worthy of these type of accolades.

**2000-2009 The Decade we were quiet**

for a point of contrast, consider [the protests during the 1968 elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention).  The times were similar.  We had a population who GREATLY mistrusted the government and were vehemently against the war that we found ourselves in for over 5 years.  Did the people sit at home and play WoW or CoD?  Did they sit at home and play cards or watch T.V.?

In the grand scheme of our history those days were just a minor hiccup. Yet they had a FAR greater impact than *ALL the anti-war posts ever made to Reddit or (apologies) Digg.*

The facts are what they are.  We as a people stay within our homes FAR more than ever.  We DON'T make things difficult for our taskmasters. We barely challenge the obviously fabricated facts they build their sand-castles upon, yet we moan and groan as if all our cyber-bitching might eventually reach receptive ears.

They will not.

Get off your asses.  Take back your public spaces.  Demand your right to peaceably assemble.  Fuck the man and all his abuses!

Just because somebody comes up with a concept or idea does not automatically give it equal value to other concepts and ideas.  Where evidence shows something is possible then that backs up the idea.  Where no evidence exists not believing it is not faith or a belief in non-existence it is merely a conclusion from evidence.

If evidence suggests otherwise then one can change the opinion they hold.

&gt;There's a lot more respect and women are equal participants in the intercourse, which is about mutual pleasure.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Are Austrians just preaching anarchy?

No, liberalism.

&gt;If not what role do they assign to government?

Protection of life, property, and contract (liberalism).

&gt;Is all government intervention bad?

Coercion, yes, is always bad. Please read about the [Non-aggression principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle).

&gt;Don't markets themselves have to be protected (from unscrupulous market participants)?

All protection required was listed above. No, I do not believe in a government product rating agency (private firms already do that better anyways, looking at you google).

&gt;How do Austrians describe the Tulip bubble (Amsterdam)?

I answered this question in the above post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/aka57/what_the_hell_happened_to_the_economics_subreddit/c0i1al2

Read the ""Legal Changes"" section of that wikipedia page.

&gt;Do they make a distinction between when the government acts with force and when it acts as a market participant (as the fed does)?

The Federal Reserve is __anything__ but a market participant. That's like saying, in the child's economy for candy, Dad is a market participant. Dad has access to unlimited candy! Imagine I force you to use ""erubucks"", while printing them out in my back room. You are forced to sell in ""erubucks"", which again I can just make. Would you call me a market participant or a coercive interventionist?

&gt;Also I don't like the idea of free market currency?

You don't? Well then good news - Austrians support a 100% gold-backed dollar (different from The Gold Standard). This would mean a ""United States"" bill that has a _fixed_ metal value. Not technically free market, yet not technically coercion. Please read [The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar](http://mises.org/story/1829).

&gt;May be that was the best we could do in the past, but why should we use it now?

I don't follow. We should use it now for the same reasons we used it in the past - it is a non-fiat hard-to-produce commodity.

&gt;Everybody desires a stable currency so why let (potentially greedy) private individuals control it?

Right now, ostensibly, a SINGLE MAN controls your entire life savings (if you keep your savings in dollars). Do you think him immune to greed? Do you pray to this man? If he is immune to greed why not just make him Emperor? Do you even know his name?

Of course, _all human beings_ are greedy, as greed and altruism are both neatly reduced into ""Man Acts"". If this interests you, [the book that changed my life](http://mises.org/humanaction/introsec1.asp) is 100% free and open-source online (though it is &lt;800 pages).","1262316797"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The title implied that China is executing people whose businesses would have gotten a bailout in other countries. I took the response to be the nonsense idea that the officers at companies that received bailout money would have been better off executed.

I think that selling tainted products that kill people is immoral in any society I can imagine. The same goes for fraud. These practices should lead to criminal prosecution with punishment, and while I am not sanguine about capital punishment, significant life sentences should be possible.

Other practices like structured finance, leveraging assets, bundling investments, and taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities, have little to do with morality in my opinion. I know this is not the opinion everywhere, but that vast majority of people who understand the math do not think there is anything implicitly immoral about our financial system and conclude that the benefits to the economy's welfare far outweighs the costs.

As for the equivalency between stealing millions of dollars though fraud in order to waste the resources on your own personal consumption, or knowingly relaxing safety standards to the point that people are killed, I do not think that is so outlandish.

Money decisions are made everyday where the costs are weighed against the potential lives that will be lost or saved. For example, if a certain type of guard rail enhancement on a roadway will cost $100,000, it might only be built if the probability that someone will die due to its absence over a 20 year period is estimated at greater than 5%.

Therefore, someone who misappropriates $100M may very well have affected these spending decisions to the extent that 5 people lost their lives who wouldn't have if the money had been spent.

Does that mean that the unauthorized trading position operated by the guy at Societe General that lost the bank $8B approximated the killing of 350 people? I suppose it depends on how the actual value that was lost and won is actually accounted for. (The money he lost most likely ended up the profit for someone else, a shuffling of assets — it is not like the dead-weight loss of the destruction of infrastructure during warfare.)

As for mistakes made by people who are authorized, I think that anyone who has held decision making positions realizes that they never have 100% of the necessary information, and that many of their decisions involve balancing potentially catastrophic risks. That doesn't mean that executives should be arbitrary, but it does mean that they have to accept the burden of managing risk.

If executions are one of the potential outcomes of business failure, then the pool of people seeking top positions will be limited, and the people who remain will either be those who are really bad at assessing risk, or overly cautious when they actually assume the positions. The tightened lending from banks to small businesses shows us just one of the problems that can come from caution.

One has to acknowledge that the banks are not lending to small businesses precisely because they are being told to keep their reserve ratios high or risk being shutdown. Business dictates that they make more money when they lend more deposits, but they can only stay in business if they are stable and can meet withdrawal demands of their depositors.","1262316846"

iMac had a brilliant design that is [being copied all over the place](http://reviews.cnet.com/desktops/?filter=1101504_13055307_), now deemed by the industry as All-in-one because of the popularity of the iMac.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I started using in high school.  I never used needles, though, thank the Unnamed God.  My cousin and I experimented with it here and there - she used it first, then introduced it to me.

Fast forward to the months following graduation.  I had a bad circle of friends, and I seemed to be more interested in smoking dope than going to school, so I dropped out of the community college I was going to.  I just couldn't bring myself to go every day.  It was probably one of the biggest mistakes I ever made.  The other is catching 2 assault cases.  I did 13 months of probation.  Not once did I get drug tested.  I started seeing a guy I'd had my eyes on for years, and I knew he had some substance abuse (coke, mostly) issues, and depression issues, but no one knew just how deep his problems were till he committed suicide just after Thanksgiving 1997.  We buried him on his birthday, December 5, 1997.  I remember he told me he knew someone I sort of knew.  The night of his service I went to the local pool hall (a very sentimental place, and a hot spot in town) to meet up with friends so we could celebrate his life and try to find a happier place.  I ran into the guy he said he knew, and I confronted him and broke the news, as he didn't know.  He took the news pretty hard, just like the rest of us.

Anyway, I knew the guy was really big in the dope game around town.  That night we wound up back at his house (no, I never slept with the guy, before you even ask) and that night I started down what could have been a disastrous path.  I got lucky, in the end, though.  Not long after the new year I started working at the pool hall, and I was also working at the grocery store as a checker.  I'd work days at the store, then work till about 3 am at the pool hall during the week.  The rest of the time I spent at ole dude's house in S. Dallas.

That guy's girlfriend died X-mas eve 1997 in a car accident, and that sent him spiraling absolutely out of control.  He'd already been shooting up, but after his girl's death it got alot worse.  We (a collective of maybe 5-6 people) trashed the inside of his house (his mom's house, actually) and sanded the floor and painted the inside of the house purple and green.

One day about 2 weeks before X-mas I was supposed to meet one of my chick friends at his house so we could do some dope together.  She got there first, but I never made it because I wrecked my truck.  She said he was shooting up, and she was furious at me.

Me and that guy eventually parted ways, but me and that same chick friend did a whole bunch of dope together whenever we had the opportunity.  One night she had a party at her apt. and we were supposed to go get some herb.  Well, the herb lady was also the dope lady, and instead of making a quick round trip, we posted up in the locked bedroom doing dope until about 3 am.  We ignored calls and pages.  When we got home, her ole man was all kinds of pissed off.  We made excuses, and I left.  Later after they broke up, he was mad at me because of all this.  I understand why, now.

I was allowing some folks to sell drugs at the pool hall while I looked the other way, and in turn they kept we pretty well supplied.  I had more money than I knew what to do with since I had 2 jobs and few bills.  The pool hall job paid cash, and I had hella tips.  I had money, I had free drugs, and I thought life was just grand.  I eventually quit the grocery store job and some bull shit happenned at the pool hall (permits, etc.) that caused me to get a ticket and I went off on the owner, and we mutually parted ways.  Ticket dismissed.

Anyway, I eventually got my 1st tech job working in a call center, and I fell into a cirle of yet more dope users.  Fast forward a little bit - I quit that job and went to work at Earthlink.  More dope users.  I wound up getting with this guy who I worked with, and his roomie was another coworker, and that guy's girl was a coworker, and her Sancho on the side was the dope pusher.  We all had the same schedule, and we all practically lived together - the 2 roomies live close to work.  We'd get off work, go ""home"", do dope and play Farkle, and then go back to work.  Sancho would come over with huge rocks and we'd break it all down and have a good time.

I wound up leaving Earthlink and I got another job, and it's funny - in the DFW area it seems like call centers are full of junkies, and the junkies get around.  There's 1 guy I've worked with at 3 different places - junkie as hell.  Well, I would always flirt with one of the supervisors there - he was good buddies w/ the guy from the 3 different jobs.  Me and the 3 job guy did all sorts of drugs together and we'd get drunk and have a good time.

Well, I eventually left that job, and job-hopped for a while, and wound up unemployed for a year.  I started dating the supe I'd flirted with, and one day we did some dope and we went out to the movies to see School of Rock with his 10 yr. old daughter.  We were sitting in a cafe and he had the dope in a mini-backpack on his keychain, and I knew it.  he wasn't paying attention and she picked it up to look at it.  I had to get his attention without blowing it, so I said ""that little backpack is cute, huh?"" and he snatched it away from her.

the next day i was on my way home from his house, and he was nearby in his truck - we were going the same way.  he was so spun out on dope that he lost control of the truck in traffic and nearly had an accident.  i never saw him after that - he was ok, though.  i talked to him a few times, but he stood me up one night and i confronted him on it and didn't like the response i received.  there was something about my relationship with him that was a wakeup call.  that was in september 2003.

i have been off meth ever since.  i have not touched it, not even once, in over 6 years.  cold.  fucking.  turkey. maybe i'm a rarity, but i didn't get busted, i didn't go to jail (not for dope, anyway) and i didn't lose large amounts of money to it (all the dope i ever did was free) and i didn't have any long-lasting physical problems or any withdrawal.  i did lose 25 lbs. in a week, but to look at me now and even then you'd know im not missing any meals, haha!

i do have some friends who are into doing dope, and some of them are so far spun out that i don't know if they can come back.  others, in the same circle, have caught cases and they vow to turn their lives around.

as of now, i'm single, no kids, i have the trifecta - job, car, apartment.  i love my job and i've been here 3 1/2 years, doing voip support.  it took a while before i could be around it and not to be tempted.  i never gave in, though, not once, after september 2003.  i dont like being around it at all.  i refuse to have it in my car or apartment.  i know some of my friends do it, and once in a while im tempted, but i know i'll never, ever do it again.  one puff is all it takes.

when people ask me why i don't do meth, i tell them it's because i like it.  i loved it when i did it, and im sure if i did it i'd enjoy it, at least till it wore off, then i'd hate myself.  but, i like my life and my freedom and my health, and my dignity and sanity, so i don't do it.

now, i'll burn some trees all day long.  hell yeah, puff puff pass, man!!  :)

**tl;dr:** i used to be on dope, but now i'm clean.","1262317060"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","[So #89 Kevin's Quest, part 1](http://www.legorobotcomics.com/?id=89) happened to my buddy in college. The pieces of this story were cobbled together a week later after it happened...

He did acid (mostly paper) in college and would see how much he could do and not completely lose his mind. One night, at another buddy's apartment, he did just that - *lose his fucking mind*.

He started by ripping off all his clothes. He'd go back and forth between being calm and laughable, to paranoid and menacing. This went on for hours. Our other buddy (who rented the apartment) called in another buddy of ours whose role for the evening was to be the 'big guy' ... the guy who would straighten out problems for those going on a bad trip. To be the big guy, you had to be a) calm, b) not on acid, and c) big.

The 'big guy' got there and found my buddy who was tripping ever-so-hard in his own car, completely naked. He couldn't figure out how to drive, but was curiously preoccupied with the steering wheel, alternately playing with it like a 3-year-old who enjoyed it, then wanted to see it ripped off.

The big guy could not calm my buddy down, and after an hour or two... left. ***The big guy left***, and that only meant that now an otherwise complete lunatic was left to himself and his tripped-out mind.

The sun was starting to come up, and my buddy made his way out of his car, but apparently couldn't find the apartment of our common friend, as they all looked the same to him. This was college, and people were going to class... and he was apparently harrassing some of them. The last thing he himself remembers is being on the ground in the morning dew, with a cop on his back and paramedics swarming him. He says he remembers severely resisting arrest and screaming his head off.

When he awoke, he was in a hospital bed with straps- severely confused, and feeling like complete crap. After a while, a nurse walked in... 

**Buddy**: *What happened?*

**Nurse**: &lt;with a *screw-you* tone of voice&gt; *Well, here are your parents, why don't you ask them?*

Needless to say, his parents were completely ballistic about it- their star-never-do-wrong-golden-child had his stomach pumped after being arrested by cops and subdued and knocked out.

They stopped paying for college, took the car they *just* bought him right back *and sold it*, and barely spoke to him for a few years (*and they were really close*).

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;Measuring the CO2 at one point near a heavily populated area is worthless.

It has been directly observed that the yearly average measurements from individual sites highly reflects (to within about 1%) the average of measurements from the hundreds of other sites around the globe. 

So even if we didn't have hundreds of different measurement stations positioned globally (we do), we now know that we could get very accurate information on global CO2 concentration from a small handful or even a single one.

&gt;They are admitting that they have no way to actually prove their results are correct.

The sentence you quoted is actually addressing your very point: their developed technique was able to _independently_ recreate the historical CO2 levels for the past 800,000 years, which they then compared to similar reconstructions using ice-core data.

The high correlation between her new technique and unrelated ice-core reconstructions over such a large dataset directly implies the technique she developed is valid in principle.

&gt;Without a competing technique that independently results in the same levels

This _is_ the competing technique to ice-core data and substantially increases the amount of confidence that can be placed in reconstructions of CO2 concentrations over the last 800,000 years while at the same time giving us a first look at a much longer timescale.","1262317400"

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Avatar was the first 3D movie I've seen since they started them because I never wanted to pay extra -i am poor and only see maybe one movie every 2 months- so I went to a matinee and it was $8- the same price I would pay to see the regular one in the evening. 
A friend of mine went the next weekend to see it in 3D at an imax and thought the 3D plus huge screen was a little overwhelming. 
I agree that it's likely a way for the studio to encourage people to go to the theater instead of just buying the dvd- but in the case of Avatar it really did add to the experience- which is what I had read and why I tried it for the first time.

Once panic ensued, I would head on down to the docks, hijack a 20 ton forklift, build me a nice little fort for me and the forklift out of shipping containers, and just wait things out.

Turns me on - actually DANCES with me.  face to face, coordinated movement, eyecontact, boogie-ing out together and whatnot.  Penultimate - hand holding and leading into moves. I'm not saying you have to be a ballroom dancer or totally in synch, but it pleases me when you make an effort :).

I admit this is totally subjective since the only reason I go clubbing is because I love love LOVE dancing (and like showing off once in a while, won't lie).  On a sidenote, the amount of people that can actually dance these days is dismal.

Tip - learn to relax, use your hips and upper body.  Practice rib isolation, this will help loosen your hips. Watch videos - there's a lot more going on hip gyrations.  learn to use your upper body, arms, head.  Also, you'll realize when watching videos that a lot of moves that'd you never think of as dance moves actually look fantastic when well executed.  That pretty much sums dancing up - maximizing your body's coordination and movement, and performing it with the music. It's not about sexy, but learning to feel the music and move with the beat.  I found that countless dancing in the bedroom days really helped me out :).

I just think that the python.org main page should inform server buyers of the tradeoff they will have to make when buying new servers: either use 1/24 of your new server's processing power, or gainfully use 1/24 of your new server's memory, but you can't do both, while still using the programming tools the language otherwise advertises, in the manner which you're accustomed to, when dealing with other languages which don't think that having those kinds of tradeoffs is a very good idea, and actually inform their potential users beforehand of tradeoffs they need to consider.","1262317607"

* Adaptation (First four were on Ebert's list)

* No Country for Old Men

* The Diving Bell and the Butterfly
* O Brother Where Art Thou?
* The Royal Tenenbaums

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","If you use it well, OkCupid's match algorithm is really really good.  However, they made it a little worse in the past year, and I'll tell you how to get around that.

First, to use OkCupid well, *answer lots of questions*!  You may think 1,000 questions will take forever, but if you answer a few at a time, especially if you have a few bouts of procrastination, you'll have plenty of questions answered in a few months.  When answering:

* Skip liberally.  I skip probably more than half the questions I get.

* Mark most of the ones you answer ""not very important"", and hardly any questions at all ""very important"" or ""mandatory"".  Those few that you give high importance to will have a lot of influence individually, but the large masses of less-important questions will balance them out.

Once you've got hundreds of questions answered, go look for high matches, but only trust the match numbers if you have answered a lot of the same questions as the person whose profile you're looking at.  This used to be automatic, but about a year ago OkC drastically reduced the ""uncertainty adjustment"" they used to apply to match scores, so you can now get a 90% with someone who you've only answered 30 or 40 questions in common with.  That's not very meaningful.

When you see a high match, click on ""The Two of Us"" tab, then scroll down and look in the right sidebar for something like ""Total in common: 147 questions"".  If the number you see there is under 100, I suggest ignoring the match score altogether.  If it's 100-300, take the match score with a grain of salt.

---

Okay, as for my experiences with the site:

Several of my best friends are women I met there.

I've hooked up with several women I met there, and some of those remain FWBs.

I've had a few great relationships that started through OkC (and those exes are also among the good friends I count above).

One friend I met on OkC turned into a housemate a year later, then sold me her house a few years later, after we adopted a cat she found on the back stairs which has now become my cat.  So indirectly, I have both my house and my cat because of OkCupid.","1262317867"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; ... by the turn of the century we did have things like CD-R burners, and ... iomega ""Zip disks""  were waning in popularity. 1.44MB Floppys were still around, but even then mostly for just for small file interchange, driver disks and firmware upgrades.

The majority of people were still using floppies at that time.

I bought my first CD-writer in 1999 - I very clearly remember buying it - it was a 4x and it cost £165 (about $330 US). Only geeks go out and spent that much money on computer accessories - that was as true then as it is now.

If you were a geek - or had bought a brand-new, top-end PC - in the couple of years before 1999, then maybe you had a Zip drive, but your generalisation suggesting that they were barely used by 1999 just isn't true.

You're overlooking the majority of PC owners - my mother-in-law at the time - who only used a computer for writing letters, quotes &amp; invoices for their business, and who would quite happy make a PC last 5 years or longer if it continued to manage those chores. All knew were floppies, and sadly I can just see a package like this appealing to them.

I hate floppy disks about  as much as anyone - well, actually, I have a slight nostalgia for [proper olde floppy disks](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/5.25-inch_floppy_disk.jpg/596px-5.25-inch_floppy_disk.jpg) - but I knew people who were still using 3"" floppies as recently as a year ago, because it was just all that they knew. In this particular case Sage's accounts software broke backups into 1.4mb chunks and prompted the user to change the disk - the user's data was *important* and they were therefore too scared to break the backup routine they'd learned &amp; followed religiously since they first started using the program.","1262317947"

He means the world to you; I get that. But stop thinking about this as your problem. You didn't tell those people about whatever it is that's in your past. I'm guessing you didn't kill anyone or molest a child or rape anyone, since I suppose one of these people would have called the police by now if that were the case. 

If you just had some sort of orgy or made a nude video or something, big deal. You told this guy and gave him a chance to tell you that was a deal-breaker for him. He said it wasn't. If that's changed now that some asshole tried to get between you by leveraging his family and friends to manipulate him, then that's his problem. He's your partner and teammate--that means when something like this happens, he should be on your side comforting you and reassuring you that he'll make sure nobody treats you differently because of this.

I'd go stay with more supportive friends for a few days and give the current boyfriend some time to think.

Is this what you meant to imply? Do you have any evidence that he had this purpose in mind? Because the articles that I've read today all talk about previous instances of prorogation as if they were pretty innocuous events. The article in this link, for example, explains that prorogation has traditionally been used ""...after several years in power to reset Parliament’s legislative agenda, often as a prelude to an election"". Did Trudeau use prorogation for partisan purposes in the way that the current government is using it to do things like prevent confidence motions and halt discussion of the treatment of Afghan detainees?

I'm not actually trying to be hostile. Your link was interesting, and I'd be interested in additional info.

It is true that ice turns into water exactly at 0 degrees. Yet the water does not turn into ice at 0 degrees, but maybe 3-4 degrees below zero. That happens because the procedure of turning water into ice involves creation of the crystals of ice, which means that from a chaotic phase (molecules of water) an ordered structure has to be created. However, when ice turns into water, the crystals must be destroyed, and destruction happens far more easily that creation. This phenomenon works in accordance with the 2nd law of thermodynamics.","1262318057"

Unfortunately, I can't find the DVD (and that's what sucks about physical distribution) so I had to download a torrent of the game (even though I don't need the crack because I have a valid CD key) and install with that. After that, the game still checks for a disc so I had to go to gamecopyworld.com to get a no-cd patch just so I could play MW:LL.

Ugh. I hate physical distribution. Anyway, it'll work with a cracked version, but honestly, there isn't that much of a nag with SecuROM. You see the dialog once for about 10 seconds while installing and it never comes up again.

"gonewild","t5_2qq5c","I responded to a post about this a few months ago, so I'll just copy/paste it here.

I'm a female and I've received anal sex from my boyfriend many times, but it took a lot of work to be receptive to it.

I was and still am a bit repulsed by the anal region, and the fear of contact with feces still sometimes lurks in the back of my mind...which makes me lose focus and often leads to pain or at least discomfort. First off, I find it much easier to let my partner ease me into anal sex as opposed to taking it into my own hands. Before we had our first successful time, I tried multiple times doing it to myself on my own but I just couldn't enjoy it. I find it much easier to enjoy if I'm already ""in the mood"", not surprisingly, and it also makes insertion significantly easier if I'm already aroused.

Things I've found to be important:

* Being clean-shaven around the anus helps to keep things cleaner and overall a better experience, but it's not a requirement. If you do shave, make sure it's either the day you're going to do it or a couple days before you do it, because razor-sharp hair on his dick is not awesome.

* You *cannot* just think ""if I just let him put it in, it'll eventually get better."" I've found this leads to premature stretching of the anus and absolutely kills the experience

* You *must* be as relaxed as possible. Many potential times were ruined by me not being relaxed enough. Maybe try meditation, incense, or even just a good back rub, but you can't be tense when you're first starting out

* Lube is your best friend...just be advised that there actually is such a thing as ""too much""; I've found a very large amount of lube can cause severe stomach pain after a while, which pretty much kills the mood

* I suggest a towel beneath you just to ensure no nasty stains on the bedsheets

* If your partner uses his finger(s) to ease you into it, be sure his nails are neatly trimmed and clean, it's sensitive in there

* Come to terms with the fact that yes, you will more than likely see some poop at one time or another. I've found the best way to minimize it is to use an enema and take a really good poop in the morning or afternoon for an evening session of anal; you want to make sure as much water as possible has been reabsorbed into your body

* **Please, only follow this if you and your partner are monogamous and have both been tested for STIs:** I personally find a condom very uncomfortable during anal sex; it can create a less-smooth texture which causes discomfort, but again, I only suggest this if you and your partner are both verified ""clean"". If you're not both 100% positive that you (or your partner) are clean, go for it with a condom; you may be very glad you did.

Best of luck to you; if you have any questions feel free to message me.","1262318209"

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","Seems like there should be a program up there that would allow them to receive assistance properly completing the well so that it could not contaminate surface or ground water.

Raw natural gas has no odor. Odor is added in processing to allow people to smell it. If the well was leaking and conditions were right, a very dangerous situation could occur where natural gas concentrations along the ground reached high enough levels to allow a small spark to cause an explosion. This has happened before and is the reason why the rotten egg odor is added to the gas.

Hydrocarbons in the drinking water are not a good thing either, especially if they contain hazardous elements, which is common for oil and gas wells. Want some benzene with your cup of joe? Me neither.

Many areas are fighting contamination of well water by gas and oil drilling, especially where exploration is occurring for gas in shale formations such as North Texas, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, etc. It is a tough nut to crack since the producers don't want to take responsibility for their damages unless it is conclusively proven that damage has resulted from their actions. To prove something like this one typically needs to have a historical record of well water composition to allow them to correlate contamination with drilling activity. Court cases have been fought on this. Some won by homeowners, most though have been won by the drillers.

Another issue I see here that I have experience with is the age of the well and the history of the well. When this well was drilled, there was probably no comprehensive set of rules for drillers to follow to protect surface water, to control production rates, to optimize production rates, etc. When this well was drilled it may not have produced economical quantities of natural gas so it was simply abandoned by the operator instead of being plugged. In this specific case it looks like the operator walked away from it by giving the well to a group of landowners and leaving them with the responsibilities of producing, maintaining, and eventually plugging the well thus saving themselves a ton of money. There are hundreds of thousands of abandoned wells in the US and Canada, many of them are only located when they begin to seep oil or gas into surface waters causing pollution. The original operators of the wells may not even be known or may no longer exist as a business entity so when the well is to be plugged someone has to do the legwork to find out who should foot the bill. 

The mechanical equipment itself should be repairable but since they are elderly they probably don't have the money in their budget to handle the repairs. Sounds like it may be like many fields here in Texas back in the 70's which used the natural gas produced with the oil as fuel for the pump that produced the oil since gas was cheap and was frequently flared or wasted back then. Lately, natural gas is more valuable and many fields are electrified, even using solar power to drive well machinery in remote areas.

Sounds like they need their water well tested for contamination especially since he has leukemia (maybe not related but...), they need the well casing tested to check that it is properly protecting ground water through the local productive interval, they need a new pump and a tight dependable distribution line to each of those owners entitled to the gas, and they need the local government to offer assistance instead of a stick in the eye. There should be oil and gas operators locally who would be able to assist them in getting their gear up to snuff but unfortunately, they will want to be paid and it appears that this may not be possible without outside intervention.

I'm not sure that the government shut them out of their well to force them to buy from some other source. I think there are legitimate safety issues that no one wants to address or has the means to address.

Sorry for the long post.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Watch plenty of Alton Brown's ""Good Eats"" and ""[America's Test Kitchen](http://www.americastestkitchentv.com/)"".

I dropped a dime for a [Lodge Dutch Oven](http://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Logic-Pre-Seasoned-5-Quart-Handles/dp/B00063RWYI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1262317438&amp;sr=8-1).  I now make AMAZING [no-knead bread](http://www.breadtopia.com/basic-no-knead-method/) and a roast for just a few dollars.  When you want to *kick it up a notch* you can spring for a nice Choice Top Rib Roast (thanks Alton Brown!!!!!!!!!!!!) for around $5 per pound.  That's fucking prime rib mate.   OMG, next up I buy a syringe to inject that shit straight into my veins.  Best thing I have EVER eaten and no restaurant will EVER come close! (p.s. I'm comparing that meal against a $580 meal at Bacchanalia in Atlanta, 5 Michelin stars)

in short:  get pationate about cooking.  Don't be scared of spending a few dollars on essential cookware if it's of a quality that will last decades (cast iron etc.).

I recently made the above moves, and I cannot even begin to express how good the food is.  My wife now INSISTS that I have a no-knead bread loaf ready every third day.

I could start linking recipes but you must find your own way grashopper!  start with [Good Eats](http://www.foodnetwork.com/good-eats/index.html) and jump right into America's test kitchen when you have a thought about a particular foodstuff.  The key is to be adventurous and very soon, you'll be enjoying treats like homemade biscuits and ham, Enchiladas Verde and even simple and rustic pleasures like brown beans with onions and cornbread.  You'll find the things that appeal to you, you just have to be willing to learn in the kitchen the same way that you learn at the computer desk!","1262318339"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Just out of curiosity, why do you consider the bullet the main part of the cartridge?

Your engine/car example seems to back up the OP.  You say a bullet is the main part and if the cartridge fails it's OK to say ""these bullets are dead.""  But then later you mention a car, well, the engine is the main part of a car so if the vehicle doesn't run it should be equally as OK to state that the engine is broken, even *if* you don't know if that's the case or not - but you seem to think that's not proper?  Maybe I'm misunderstanding your example but the bullet is a non-functional dead weight that does nothing... it would more like blaming your fender for your car not starting I think.

Honestly, I see the dissemination of factual information as a positive thing.  It leads to threads like this where people that have no clue can and do learn about the make up of a cartridge.  Same goes for correcting someone that tries to say their alternator is attached to their gas tank.  Correct 'em, and next time they won't look like they are stupid.  It's doing them a favor.

The home owner's association is being a huge dick in enforcing the contract, but they have that right.  Would you rather the government have the power to nullify arbitrary private contracts.

I've never been depressed but I have definitely had some major anxiety issues that went along with it. I have had extreme bouts of depersonalization or derealization that lasted for months at a time. Worrying about it was'nt helping matters at all. The more I tried to be indifferent to the feelings and not be so amazed at how different i felt, the easier it was to cope, and it actually started to be less intense over time. Its really hard at first, but try not to worry about it. just say fuck it, even if you feel depersonalized for the rest of your life, its not going to kill you. and if you dont worry about it, It will go away anyways.
 
I was in a relationship during this time as well. My girlfriend knew about my issues from the beginning, and was willing to put up with them. in retrospect, i dont know if that was a good thing overall, because it may have made me too dependent on her. 

I dont know if this helps in the slightest bit, or if i have even remotely answered any of your questions. as for the trust thing, I dont know if it has anything to do with the depersonalization.

"science","t5_mouw","There are many children (as well as adults) that confuse television with reality.  Obviously 99.99% of them realize that cartoons aren't real.  But when little Timmy see's one of the kids shows featuring live people and perhaps puppets, it's not so easy to distinguish.  What about people and shows like CSI?  There are many many people that think that a picture can be enhanced to show details smaller than one of its pixels.  There are many many people that think the FBI brings down the full might of their labs and investigators with every death.  There are many many people who think that the government is tracking them 24/7 because of an episode of Twilight Zone.

It's not a mental illness that causes people to think those things about the FBI or the 'enhance,' but the Twilight Zone thing could potentially be an indicator of mental illness.  I would say that schizoid thoughts would be more like CSI.  They're 100% TRUE to the sufferer, and there may be a seed of actual truth to the rest of us.  Sure, you're meeting your date for dinner.

As a girl on the internet though, I kind of hated the Irene Adler.

The girls that were on it did seem pretty interesting and intelligent though.  I didn't take the matching algorithm on it seriously at all though, or on any other site for that matter.  It's really just about browsing through profiles yourself.  

I tried Plenty of Fish instead and that worked out for me pretty well.  There were more members there.  

In general I've found online dating to be a pretty good way of meeting women.  I consider myself to be a pretty average guy as well.  

It has its quirks and annoying aspects though.  If I had to give one piece of advice it would be to give it a fair chance and not get annoyed and throw in the towel too early.  

Also, be willing not take things personally and learn from your mistakes.  If your profile isn't getting responses than switch it up, or put up better pictures.  If people aren't replying to your messages than try a different approach.  If you go on a bad date, try to figure out what you did wrong that you can change for next time.  ","1262318720"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","The reason such ""appeals to nature"" are typically fallacious is that people use ""it's natural"" to mean ""there is an evolutionary trend to suggest that what I said previously is true"" when no such trend or evolution exists. If they were to spell out exactly what they mean, they would immediately notice that their reasoning is flawed. For example, there is no evolutionary history or biological evidence to suggest that cocaine is ""good"" or that natural plants can't harm you, but suddenly when you say ""natural"" it seems as though you don't need any actual evidence anymore. I blame this on religion: people assume that a higher power created everything; therefore, everything created by this higher power is good.

However, I am saying that a trend toward morality being the default actions and immorality being those actions selected against evolutionarily exists, which it does. There is no fallacy in my argument.","1262318734"

It's not *worse*, it's *different*. 

The constant is that reddit has been majority rule, and that the change that has taken place (for example, from a programmer-oriented site to a politically liberal site) has been by consensus. In effect you're just saying ""well, I don't like majority rule anymore, so let's stop having it"".

Humans are animals. What we do is, by definition, natural. You _cannot_ keep an environment in a ""natural"" state by artificially maintaining it against outside forces, human or otherwise. It ends up being just as unnatural as a zoo, only on a larger scale.

No, if you think that human activity is unnatural, than environs maintained by humans in a ""natural"" state is also unnatural.

1. FBI/Customs let passengers from another flight co-mingle with the passengers of flight 253 while the most important investigation in 8 years was pending. I have already stated that not one person who wasn't a passenger or law enforcement personnal was in our area the entire time we were detained by Customs.
2. FBI/Customs while detaining the flight 253 passengers in perhaps the most important investigation since the last terrorist attack, and despite not letting any flight 253 passenger drink, eat, make a call, or use the bathroom, let those of other flights trample through the area and possibly contaminate evidence.
3. You have to believe the above (1 and 2) despite the fact that no flights during this time allowed passengers to exit off of the planes at all and were detained on the runway during at least the first hour of our detention period.
4. You have to believe that the man that stood 20 feet from me since we entered customs came from a mysterious plane that never landed, let its passengers off the plane and let this man sneak into our passenger group despite having extremely tight security at this time (i.e. no drinking even).
5. FBI/Customs was hauling mysterious passengers from other flights through the area we were being held to possibly comtaminate evidence and allow discussions with suspects on Flight 253 or to possibly allow the exchange of bombs, weapons or other devices between the mysterious passengers from other flights and those on flight 253.","1262318915"

"books","t5_2qh4i","Really? I loved the conclusion of the Dark Tower series. I thought it was perfect. 

(spoilers) 


While I was disappointed with some of the offhand ways people die in the last book or two, I think the end of Roland's quest was spot on. Very Buddhist in that his quest repeats over and over. Though he begins his quest for the final time with his horn, implying that maybe this time will be different. Maybe because of some choices he made, this time will be the last. Also, in the end of the poem ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"" (which the series was inspired by), Childe Roland reaches the dark tower, blows his horn, and his quest is over. Maybe when Roland reaches the tower for the last time, with his horn, his quest will finally end (reach nirvana).

In other countries, there is a lot of social status and job opportunities associated with degrees.  I don't know if it is that they are rarer, or it's just the culture.

If we retain any vestige of an aristocratic society, it is highly sublimated.

Our liberal, frontiersman image may be more mythos that fact.  At least, if you look at other regions like Australia, Xinjuan, or Siberia, one has to look for parallels.

I used to work in a very large company that grew primarily by acquisition. As the company provided incentives for acquired company management to stay, there weren't many complete failures but on the other hand there wasn't much synergy between the existing company and the newly acquired business units.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It's called having a [word-finding difficulty](http://www.wordfinding.com/definition&amp;characteristics.html), sometimes also known as the [""tip of the tongue"" phenomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue), or in French, presque vu (almost seen). 

It happens to everyone at least some of the time, but some people experience it more frequently than others. It seems to be especially common in individuals with reading difficulties or attention/information processing problems. 

There are a couple of theories about why it happens. The one that makes the most sense to me is that sometimes you can pull the semantic representation (meaning) of the word from your memory, but for some reason can't pull up the phonemic representation (sound) of the word. This may be because you have lots of different neural connections to the meaning of the word - e.g., other words that have similar meanings, times when you've heard the word, a visualization of what the word means, etc - so that gives you lots of possible 'cues' to facilitate your memory of the meaning. However, you only have one connection to the phonemic meaning of the word - how it sounds - and so if you can't remember that, it's just really hard to pull up the word. 

Word finding strategies include relaxing (often that works, if you give it enough time), and trying to help yourself recall the phonemic representation through various strategies. The most commonly-used strategy is to mentally go through the alphabet and see if any of the letters jog your memory as the first letter of the word. You can also try singing or saying the sentence that you are trying to remember the word for aloud in a silly voice, to see if changing up the modality helps your recall.

Misogyny is definitely the ugly core of why men can't wear dresses, but it's not something that ""men"" enforce.  I think fubo's post about men enforcing masculinity rules and women enforcing femininity rules is closer to the truth, but I don't fully agree with that either.  It's so far beyond ""enforcement"" that I'm not even sure it's a useful metaphor.

Having seen Aerik post before, though, I realize he's essentially a propagandist, trying to dismiss the nuance of the situation because it complicates a worldview he prefers, and that was essentially my problem with the post.  Pinning it on ""men"" essentially closes the case on a topic with uncomfortable implications for this worldview.

I think people tend to jump too quickly to claiming someone is misreading them, such that online discussions can degenerate rapidly into simple exchanges of such accusations.  You can't know what I'm thinking, only what I actually type, and ""misreading"" is pretty much inevitable in an debate because of that.  So I didn't intend on guilt-tripping you over that, which I myself then did to you in your most recent quoted text.

In this case, though, I felt that how you wanted to be read, and how you wanted me to read Aerik, was so different from how you read me that it essentially created a debate where you played all three roles, and Aerik and I didn't even have to participate.

"politics","t5_2cneq","After reading the comments there seem to be some recurring answers as to why we are ""supposedly"" in a sorry state:

1) Government is more answerable to corporate lobbyists than citizens
2) Humans are self-absorbed and lazy
3) Inability of dissimilar individuals to unite and take action for change
4) Education system is sub-standard
5) People deceived to act against their best interests by propaganda

There are also different attitudes as to whether we are in a sorry state or not.
1) On average people live longer
2) Industrialization leads to more availability of food and healthcare
3) Loss of tribal cultures - loss of identity and defining oneself by how one can be of service

I see several major problems facing modern society. One of the largest is making an individual feel useful and valued. In a society where the self-made man is idolized we also have individuals who fail. What do these individuals do? They usually try to organize in groups to gain more power for themselves. A society based on individualism is a lie because individuals will form tribes or networks to benefit themselves. A person does not seek identity for noble reasons but for power. We are animals.

I can't stress how influential this short was when it first premiered on Liquid Television. Most people had still not even seen Akira when this first aired in 92 but because of how popular Liquid Television was, this opened many peoples eyes to what Japan was really capable of. This could very well be one of the most important animated short films ever made. That's my honest opinion anyway.

"science","t5_mouw","Every year Waldfogel's paper on the deadweight loss of Christmas gets thrown around, and I think that although there is truth to it, we as gift-givers should just look at it as a few rules to follow.

I try to buy gifts that the recipient WOULD pay full price for IF they knew about it. Imagine a professional chef buying his amateur home cook friend a kitchen utensil or gadget. In essence, the gift is a lending of an information advantage. Similarly, I've received badass headphones from an audiophile friend and never had the knowledge to be able to be savvy consumer in that field.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","[The Big Snit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90SIuISIVB8) - Classic, Academy Award winner from 1985. Very dark humor here even though the animation is bright and happy. This is SUCH a great short.

[What's Opera, Doc?](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/430148/whats_opera_doc/) - Considered by most critics to be the greatest animated short ever made. EVER. Even if you don't agree that it's the best - it's still damn good (and the only one where Bugs dies in the end).

[The Tell-Tale Heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4s9V8aQu4c) - James Mason is perfect as the narrator here. Very creepy and goes well with the Vincent short by Tim Burton (see above).

[Gertie The Dinosaur](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY40DHs9vc4) - This was made in 1914. 1914!!!! Just look at the animation - it's better than what many people can do today. Simply amazing. If you love animation, then this is a must see. I believe many animation schools still screen this for first year students. Yeah, it's that impressive.

[Bambie Meets Godzilla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehuePPNvD6I) - It's called Bambie Meets Godzilla, what more do you need to know about it?

[End Of Summer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RmwebkPpM) - This one polarizes some people - either you like it or you don't. I can understand why some people don't like it but I like the atmosphere here. I had just played Silent Hill 2 (again) before seeing this so maybe I was just open to something really moody and sad. Still - take it or leave it.

[Crac](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2518565066307198534#) - The most beautifully animated film that has ever been (or ever will be) made. If I could only see one animated short for the rest of my life, it would be this one. It's perfect in every single way. 

[Gopher Broke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2nvsIpiT5o) - Very funny animal cartoon. Better than a Dreamworks production but not as good as what Pixar would do. It is funny though and I enjoy it every now and again.

[Peas and Carrots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n6A02Ey1vM) - Excellent CG short about a fly who gets bullied by the bigger flies over a single pea. Very well done.

[Geraldine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI6H4tbBLh8) - I really liked how this film kept surprising me - it never felt forced or predictable (even though it kind of is). Very fun gender-bender.

[Samurai Jack : Jack And The Three Blind Archers](http://clip.vn/watch/Samurai-Jack-Ep-07,QWh) - It's REALLY hard to pick the best Samurai Jack episode, but the way silence and sound is used in this episode sums up the genius if Genndy Tartakovsky.

[REACH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzg2jjH2z8E) - One word - sublime

[The Street](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54dm0Z99VOY) - Amazing, masterful storytelling. This fillm really pulls you into it's world and you will never forget the characters. Not a funny film because it's a serious film for grown-ups. Great stuff.

[Rockfish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InPlY9L5eFY) - I believe that like ""9"" (see above), this too will be made into a feature film. I hear Vin Diesel will be the voice of the voiceless character in this exciting short. The people who made it also do the FOX Sports animated football robot.

[The Last Knit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ZjMWLqJvM) - If you go into this short understanding that it's about obsession then you might have an easier time with where it goes and how it ends - at least, that's what I got out of it. Your mileage may vary, of course.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I recently purchased a Panasonic Viera 42"" 1080p 600HZ Plasma.  I took as many precautions as possible to reduce the chance of burn-in.  I aged/broke it in by playing a lot of media on it with no static imagery for about 14 days (not consecutively.  I'd say about 200 hours or thereabouts.)  Then, when I felt it was safe to do so, I used my television for the purpose for which I had originally bought it: gaming.  I did not have the television on torch mode; on the contrary, the contrast and brightness were at about 30-40.  Granted I had two marathon sessions of Demon's Souls two days in a row (each about 8 hours), but I figured that with all precautions I had taken any image retention I might notice would be merely of the temporary sort.

Well, I got burn-in, anyways.  Very noticeable burn-in. (I should have turned the HUD off, but that makes the game even more difficult when it's already maybe a tad too trying.)  I ran the anti-image retention feature for a number of hours.  I turned the television to static and left it that way for a number of hours.  Then I turned it off and left it in that state for at least a half a day.  After 24 hours+ the burn-in was as noticeable as ever if not more so (that doesn't make sense but it almost seemed to be more pronounced.)  Definitely permanent IR.

(This was my first HDTV, by the way, as I'm sure you had probably already discerned.  I'm rather poor and had preferred to spend my money on games and books rather than an HDTV, which had been way out of my price range for some time.)

I took it back to BestBuy and got a full refund (thankfully it was the day after Christmas when the return lines are going right out the door and they're anxious to get everyone the fuck out of there.)

I know this reads rather cool-story-bro so far, but it's leading somewhere. I swear.

Where did I go wrong?  I'm the sort of person who, when he really gets into a game, can't stop playing, of which sort I am sure there are many.  Is it reasonable for television manufacturers and retailers to expect people to watch a show or play a game with static imagery for only about a half hour at a time?  That's not satisfying in the least.

I have no options here:

LCDs suck on account of ghosting, comparatively narrow color gamut, aliasing, terrible contrast ratios, narrow viewing angles, and burn-in.

LED LCDs have most of the same problems and are out of my price range.

OLEDs can't be purchased in large sizes; they're obscenely expensive; and they have crappy picture quality for the time being.

You can't even buy HDCRTs, as far as I am aware, and they *theoretically* have the same susceptibility to burn-in as plasmas and are way too wide and unsightly.

DLP televisions, I believe, have an obnoxious rainbow effect.

Plasmas can't be used as televisions are meant to fucking be used because of their inordinate susceptibility to burn-in.  And even if they don't develop burn-in, you still have IR which is annoying to a person like me with obsessive, punctilious tendencies.

Projection televisions have expensive-ass bulbs and you have to paint the walls of the room black and remove every last iota of ambient light.

And, finally, my old standard definition CRT makes PS3 games look like PS2 games.

Then you're using a segment in which Dawkins correctly states that we don't know how life began on Earth, and when pressed makes a fantastic hypothesis that maybe, possibly, an advanced civilization used its technology to create self-replicating cells and seeded the earth with them.

There is nothing in that very short excerpt from a very failed movie that supports Dawkins admitting intelligent design.  Abiogenesis is a separate topic from evolution.  Dawkins, as a proper scientist and skeptic, acknowledges that he doesn't know how life began on this planet.  He has repeatedly pointed out that you don't, either.  If we're going to accept that some infallible deity is responsible for designing and starting life on this planet, then there has to be some evidence to support it, some experiment we can perform to confirm or deny it.  Without any such evidence or ability to test this hypothesis, the idea remains pure fantasy.

Anyways, the proper amount should be $145.00 dollars.  

To show how the calculation should work, let's use $10,001 and $2,500 down payment as an example.  He does the math and gets 145.015... as the monthly payment.  He does some math to try to get the decimal part and gets 0.02.  He then converts the number to a integer (145) and appends the decimal to the integer getting 145.02.


What's happening when it doesn't work is it does the math and gets 144.996... for the amount.  It tries to take two positions of decimals in this case, but what is happening is it gets 1 instead of .00.  Then it appends this to 144 which gives 1441.

Russian writer Vadim Erlikman, for example, makes the following estimates: executions, 1.5 million; gulags, 5 million; deportations, 1.7 million out of 7.5 million deported; and POWs and German civilians, 1 million – a total of about 9 million victims of repression.
Some have also included deaths of 6 to 8 million people in the 1932–1933 famine as victims of Stalin's repression. This categorization is controversial however, as historians differ as to whether the famine was a deliberate part of the campaign of repression against kulaks and others, or simply an unintended consequence of the struggle over forced collectivization.","1262320255"

As for the ""insane bandwagon"" idea. well, it's not a bandwagon because no one is going to shun you for not criticising religion. Personally I only really criticise the abrahamic movements (Christianity, Judaism, and Islam). And yes, we should hold people responsible for fucked up stuff they do in the name of god, but we should also call out the religion itself. The reason is that the Abrahamic religions are not philosophy or concepts as much as they are allegiances. Christianity says you are to do what god tells you no mater what. In the case of Christianity God is to be held responsible, but god is just an idea, so we can condemn the book, and the preachers who create ""gods word"".

I don't think writing off religion as a whole is stupid. To me that would mean drawing a clear line in the sand. ""any story that can not be verified in some way should be considered fictional, and therefor can not be used as the basis of law, or any institution that will affect others that do not chose to be affected."" I think that would be completely worth doing. something like that should be in our Constitution to clarify the separation of church and state and to protect us from people like creationists.

I would be happy to continue this conversation with you, but I probably won't respond until tomorrow. Happy new year! May 2010 be filled with rationality and peace.

In my opinion for becoming well versed with linux one has to learn the following

1. Learn one editor - VIM. (Or) any other editor you like.

2. Learning how to configure linux using the config files (Mostly available in /etc directory). Never use GUI if you want to learn it properly.

3. Screw-up your machine and fix it.

4. Learn how to build applications from source.

5. Share and help the community. More you share your learning experience with the community the better you will get.

6. If you have lot of time you can play with LFS &amp; BLFS.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, here I am waiting for New Year's with time to spare so I'm going to UNLOAD some LEARNING on you.

Counterfeit notes are bad news.  Besides the possibility of being charged with a crime, whoever is discovered in possession of counterfeit notes loses the value of the note - it's simply worthless, confiscated, you don't get that money back.  So everyone has an incentive to avoid acquiring counterfeit money, right?  And an incentive to minimize the damage if they do acquire such a bill.

On the flip side, no law requires anyone to accept anything prospectively to do business with anyone.  If the deal hasn't happened yet, no one has to accept anything - not pennies, not loonies, not 20s, not 100s, nothing.

However, money is legal tender.  What this means is precisely this - pay attention here - if you have a debt, and you offer money to pay it, the debt-owner can't refuse it and then sue you to pay in some other fashion.  Money settles all legal debts, by definition.

SO.  In situations where the deal hasn't happened yet, the merchant can refuse to make the deal and accept your money.  In situations where the deal has already happened - for instance, a restaurant, where you've already eaten the food and now owe a debt for it - the restaurant cannot refuse your money.  Well, they can, but they can't seek any other form of payment via the court system, so practically speaking, they can't refuse your money.

Note that coins are legal tender only for small amounts - paying off your mortgage with pennies is not legal tender.  The bank can accept it, but does not have to.  However, paper notes are legal tender (I believe) always.  So I think you could pay off your mortgage with $5 bills, and the bank would be required to accept it.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The original purpose behind copyright laws was to benefit society by encouraging creative people to create new works. Obviously, extending copyright beyond an author's death won't lead to any new works from that individual.

The current copyright law in the U.S. was put in place under the [Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) of 1998](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act). The law is sometimes referred to as the Sonny Bono Act or the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. 

It is known by those other names because Sonny Bono was a strong well-known proponent for it when he was in Congress. And it was backed by the Disney Corporation along with other corporations standing to benefit from it . The article [Why Disney Has Clout with the Republican Congress](http://www.eagleforum.org/column/1998/nov98/98-11-25.html) has information on how money was funneled to key people in the House and Senate to ensure the bill was passed. 

Disney's copyright on Mickey Mouse was scheduled to expire in 2003, on Pluto in 2005, on Goofy in 2007, and on Donald Duck in 2009, so extending the copyright period could potentially be worth billions to Disney.

So the impetus behind the bill wasn't to further the public good, which was its original intent, but to protect the corporate profits of Disney and some other companies that would benefit from its passage.

As to making copyrights permanent, Mary Bono, Sonny Bono's widow and successor to his Congressional seat wanted to do just that. When informed that it would be unconstitutional to have copyrights last forever, she thought that making it forever minus one day might suffice.

Mark Twain said ""Whenever a copyright law is to be made or altered, then the idiots assemble."" He also said ""Only one thing is impossible for God: to find any sense in any copyright law on the planet.""","1262320451"

"haskell","t5_2qh36","In the article, he mentions the following program, which he attributes to Albert Y.C. Lai:

    play = execState pro []

    pro :: State [Bool] ()
    pro = do
      pro
      s &lt;- get
      put (True : s)

About this program, he states the following:

&gt;Instead of tail recursion, this employs head recursion. The question is, what does `pro` return when you run it, and why? I found it easy to guess the correct answer, but my reasoning was completely wrong. Of course, if viewed through a wholly imperative mindset, this leads to non-termination, but the lazy state monad extracts usable information from this definition.

Intrigued by this, I decided to follow the function's evaluation.  It turned out to be pretty interesting, so I thought I'd share the exercise here.

First, let's rewrite `pro` in desugared form (i.e., without `do` notation).  `do` notation looks imperative, which invites the casual reader to ""evaluate"" it as if it were an imperative program.  In this example, that causes us to run into problems.  So let's avoid that pitfall entirely by getting rid of it.

    pro = pro &gt;&gt; get &gt;&gt;= put . (True:)

Now, `(&gt;&gt;)` is just sugar for `(&gt;&gt;=)`, so let's substitute that:

    pro = pro &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; get &gt;&gt;= put . (True:)

Let's also break this apart slightly, with the following helper definitions:

    pro = pro &gt;&gt;= part1
    part1 a = get &gt;&gt;= part2
    part2 a = put (True : a)

I could have written `part1` and `part2` point-free, but in this case the pointed definitions will make the derivation clearer.

Ok, so when we type `play` in ghci, it gets executed -- but what does that mean, really?  Remember, in a lazy language like Haskell, only things that are *needed* are executed.  So, when I type `play` at the ghci prompt, it notices that the return type of `play` is `[Bool]` and attempts to print each item of the returned list in sequence, via `print` and ultimately via `show`.  Because Haskell is lazy, it will request the head of `play` and leave the tail unevaluated, print the head, and then repeat the process for the tail of the list.  Because of this lazy behavior, as long as it can get one element from `play`, it can print something.  If the language were strict, it would try to evaluate `play` in its entirety *before* printing it, which would result in non-termination.  This is all pretty basic stuff, conceptually.  So let's move on to the evaluation.

Before we begin, we'll need a few definitions from `Control.Monad.State.Lazy`.  First, the definition of the lazy state monad itself:

    instance Monad (State s) where
        return a = State $ \s -&gt; (a, s)
        m &gt;&gt;= k  = State $ \s -&gt; let
            (a, s') = runState m s
            in runState (k a) s'

Along with it, we'll need `get` and `put`, and of course `execState`:

    instance MonadState s (State s) where
        get   = State $ \s -&gt; (s, s)
        put s = State $ \_ -&gt; ((), s)

    execState m s = snd (runState m s)

Now we're in a position to ""evaluate"" the definition of `play` to see why it works the way it does.  For those of you that are newbies, this kind of equational reasoning (which is generally not easily done with imperative languages) is a very good way to get an idea of how Haskell evaluates things.  Furthermore, keep in mind that the rules for evaluation are well defined, much as the rules of algebra are.  Can you imagine a compiler carrying out the following simplification algorithmically?  It's precisely this sort of thing that allows GHC to carry out some frightening optimizations.

Remember, all we're trying to do is reduce `play` into a form that looks like `head : tail` -- once it looks like that, ghci will be able to print `head`.  So:

    play = execState pro []

from the definition of `execState`,

         = snd (runState pro [])

and the definition of `pro`,

         = snd (runState (pro &gt;&gt;= part1) [])

Now what?  We substitute the definition of `(&gt;&gt;=)` from the lazy state monad, like so:

         = snd (runState (State $ \s -&gt; let
               (a, s') = runState pro s
               in runState (part1 a) s') [])

`runState` is just the deconstructor for `State`, that is to say, `runState . State` is the identity.  So,

         = snd ((\s -&gt; let
               (a, s') = runState pro s
               in runState (part1 a) s') [])

Now we have a function `(\s -&gt; ...)` being applied to an argument, `[]`.  We apply it (this is called *beta reduction*), getting rid of the lambda term and substituting `[]` for all `s`:

         = snd (let
               (a, s') = runState pro []
               in runState (part1 a) s')

Now we substitute in the definition of `part1 a`:

         = snd (let
               (a, s') = runState pro []
               in runState (get &gt;&gt;= part2) s')

Because `part1` didn't use its argument, `a` is no longer used anywhere.  Therefore, we can rewrite the pattern-match `(a, s') = runState pro []` as `(_, s') = runState pro []`.  In fact, that's the same as `s' = snd (runState pro [])`.  Where have we seen that before?  Why, that's the same as `s' = execState pro []`, which is in turn the same as `s' = play`.  So we can start to see the recursion emerging here, but we're not quite there yet.  Substituting `play` for `s'` and dropping the `let`, we get:

         = snd (runState (get &gt;&gt;= part2) play)

Again, we expand this out using the definition of `(&gt;&gt;=)` for the lazy state monad,

         = snd (runState (State $ \s -&gt; let
               (a, s') = runState get s
               in runState (part2 a) s') play)

Again, collapsing `runState . State` and beta reducing the lambda term we get

         = snd (let
               (a, s') = runState get play
               in runState (part2 a) s')

Substituting in the definition of `part2 a`,

         = snd (let
               (a, s') = runState get play
               in runState (put (True : a)) s')

Now, we substitute in the definition of `put`,

         = snd (let
               (a, s') = runState get play
               in runState (State $ \_ -&gt; ((), True : a)) s')

Again, collapse `runState . State` and beta reduce to give us

         = snd (let
               a = fst (runState get play)
               in ((), True : a))

Now we can evaluate `snd`, because we've simplified its argument down to a pair.  Let's substitute out `a` while we're at it.

         = True : fst (runState get play)

At this point, ghci can print out `[True,` (and it does).  Let's simplify this further though, using the definition of `get`,

         = True : fst (runState (State $ \s -&gt; (s, s)) play)
         = True : fst (play, play)
         = True : play

At this point we've reduced the definition of `play` down entirely to just

    play = True : play

... which doesn't involve the state monad at all, and is rather easier to understand.  As an exercise, carry out the same evaluation using the definition from `Control.Monad.State.Strict` instead, being careful to allow `seq` and friends to force you to evaluate things you don't actually need.  It's not difficult to see that this results in non-termination before printing anything.

Which gets to the root of the problem in my mind.  Our economic system's purpose is to deliver the results that we see today, including resource depletion (increased production) and greed (continuous growth).  With seemingly unlimited resources this was largely successful. The richest were those who worked the hardest to produce, and greed did not need to be deterred since anyone willing to work hard can have just as much, without harming others.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As far as dehumanization, I'm willing to accept your statements, with the exception of whatever contradicts my main point.

Now to the more important point:
""So, does math always refer to empirical variables when it is useful? (I'm not a mathematician)""
I think this the question answers itself. Let me reword it to make it clear:
Does math always rely on the real world variables, when making real world applications? Yes.

You cannot obtain knowledge about the world with pure reason. You need to consider empirical information in order to make rational statements about the world.

If the supernatural is unobservable or outside of natural laws (which it is by definition), then rational acceptance is impossible. What qualifies you to make factual statements about the supernatural if you just admitted that you posses no methods to do so?","1262320714"

You think about ways to express whatever algorithms you want to express, then try to design a notation that expresses them without being too verbose, yet not too unreadably terse, and doesn't have too many surprising behaviours that catch people out.

In terms of implementation? You write a program that can take some text, parse it into a parse tree (usually), and then either execute that parse tree directly (the lazy man's way), or else compile it into some efficient lower-level language like assembly, or java bytecode. Needless to say, I'm doing the former.","1262320903"

A single observation point with the ability to perceive simultaneous events, spatially separated.  Where it becomes interesting, and recursive, is in how you choose to communicate your stored data with other perception inputs.  Same observation point, different perception, storage and communication.  We are all indeed fundamentally connected.  One vast machine, talking to itself.

There is nothing wrong with introversion.  Omniscience must require perceptual nodes untainted by contact with fellow nodes, for reasons I do not yet understand.  Epiphany; Entire groups of nodes in limited contact, with conflicting data, yet consumed with the need to communicate this data, verify their perception.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Dude, I have the answer listen very carefully. There is a thing called the Nuva ring. It is a flexible rubberized ring that is inserted into the vagina. It uses the least amount of hormones of any item on the market so it shouldn't feel ""messed up"" . It can do this because the hormones are absorbed directly into the vagina. It is peace of mind. Its in for 3 weeks, she takes it out has her period and puts a new one in. Easy breezy. Plus, she never forgets to take a pill and you don't have to wonder ""is she taking the pill"". Its highly effective 98% I think? I was with my girlfriend for a year and not to be gross but we fucked like rabbits. I never felt the ring and it only came out once during sex. 
Here's another piece of advice that I found out which is why I stopped doing what your doing now. When you ejaculate in a condom the sperm travels down the length of the shaft. When you take off the condom to put a new one on for round two you can contaminate the new condom with sperm from your shaft and pelvis. The effectiveness of the condom goes down the second time around. I was actually wiping my member off with hand sanitizer there for a bit. Now my new girl is on the ring......I love the ring.

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","&gt;You should probably try it yourself, maybe you'll lighten up a little bit.

Trust me, I have.

Ecstasy is just a streetname for MDMA when pressed into a pill. Sold as the pure powder, it is known as ""Molly"". Like I said, I have been around the block a few times. Often the MDMA is cut with amphetamines to increase the rush, but not always when you buy it as a pill on the streets. Ecstasy can also be found on the streets as MDA, which is very similar but slightly more hallucinogenic. Again, I am VERY well versed and informed on the subject. No lightening up needed.

As far as the side effects and dangers of MDMA, those listed were for MDMA, not as the street drug Ecstacy (cut with Amphetamines). Look them up yourself if you disagree.

&gt;""In laboratory studies, MDMA has been proven sufficiently safe for human consumption when taken a limited number of times in moderate doses.""

You reinforced my statements. None of those warning or disclaimers I listed apply to marijuana, and nobody has ever died from pot. MDMA is a dangerous drug, which is why even in clinical environments it is prescribed in limited, controlled doses.

And no, it is not used clinically in California. It is treated as a controlled substance analogue in California and remains Schedule 1 as it has since 1985. 

I am not saying that it has no therapeutic use. What I am saying is that it is dangerous, especially when used in combination with other psychiatric drugs. Many Vets with PTSD are being treated in combination with other psychiatric illnesses. How do I know? Because I am one. Mixing MDMA with the SSRIs that I take could result in deadly side effects. Therefore it would not be considered a safe treatment.

On the other hand, Marijuana does not conflict with the SSRIs, has no intrinsic dangers, and does not need to be prescribed in controlled, limited, doses.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Seriously though, the reason women are not allowed to be priests is an issue I personally grapple with.

While in the future I have hope that this may change, I understand and respect the church's stance as it is today.

Women and Men are equal under God.  But not the same.  We have our roles, very basic roles, to fill.  The Bible is clear that wives should submit to the will of their husbands, and the husbands should respect their wives.  It doesn't make for a fun and PC teaching today, but it is a good teaching.  

So what does submission mean?  How should married life between Christians be carried out?  

The way I see it is a husband should put his wife before him, and a wife should put her husband before her.  The wife and husband should make decisions together.  But - at times - when an issue arises that both disagree on, the husband should listen to his wife's counsel with all humility and consideration, and afterwards, if he is still sure of his decision, he should be able to lead the family in making this decision, and the wife should submit to his will.  This shouldn't be a daily thing, because the husband should consider and listen to the wife at all times, and seek to make her life a happy one.  But at times when the husband - through prayer and counsel with his wife - should take the lead in making certain decisions throughout their life, and the wife should be happy to submit to her husband.  Neither role is greater or lesser, but each has its place, and all actions should be carried out with mutual love, and humility before each other and God.

But back to the priesthood.

The Bible describes male church leaders.  The family structure lends credence to a male-only priesthood.  But not enough that it should *necessarily* be a lasting ordinance.

I know many female Catholics who would be angry by my words, and tell me that it *should* be this way forever, and how dare I say it could be otherwise.  They have seen the role women have played in the church from the beginning, and revel in it, and love it.  ","1262321133"

Even better, if your module actually ""touches the system"" (reads or writes files, opens sockets, whatever) at the file scope, then those things will happen when somebody uses pydoc on it.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Well I was pretty thorough with my safety briefs. I had my own team of soldiers that I worked with who provided security for the patrols we had over watch of, but I still insisted that everyone whether it was their first patrol or their 500th participate in the brief. I was just in charge of the patrol security, not actual logistics, so I'm not sure how similar what I did is to what you will be doing. The few big things I always stressed were

 * Don't engage the locals, positively or negatively. I once had to scream at a national guard chaplain (Maj) for throwing candy to the children after I was specific about not doing that. It's hard to resist, but the last thing you want is people getting the impression that it's ok to come up to your convoy. It's bad for security, it makes it hard to distinguish real threats, and if you run one over, that's an entire family that doesn't like you.

 * Pay attention to the locals. They're going to know when something bad is going to happen way before you do. If a market that's usually busy is suddenly deserted, there's probably a reason.

 * Know everything about every vehicle you're in. Ideally they'll be a standardized load plan, but realistically there won't be. When something awful happens, you don't want to have to look for the med kit. You want to **know** that it's under the  driver seat next to the warning triangles.

 * If you don't understand something, say so. Every single safety brief I did was followed by acting out the SOP (standard operating procedure) for a random event I would make up. I'd grab 5 guys, tell them that they each represented a HMMWV and then say that one of them had just been killed. Then I'd have the subjects of my brief tell me what they were supposed to do. If you're mission leader doesn't do that, and you're not sure what to do, ask. They might think you're stupid. But if someone gets blown up, and you stop right next to them and get blown up too, they're going to know that you're stupid.

"gonewild","t5_2qq5c","Here's the perspective of a gay guy that's been on the *receiving* end =)

I recommend, as someone else did, that you do a little solo practicing. I think, above everything else, that ultimately the most important thing is that you are relaxed. No amount of lube in the world is going to make it easier if you aren't relaxed. I think going at it solo a bit is a very good way to become... acquainted with the idea =) You have complete control, you can move at your own pace, etc. You'll be less nervous when you try the real thing because you'll already know what to expect.

Further, going at it solo allows you to work up from smaller objects to the real deal. It is, of course, much easier to get something smaller in =)

On that topic, I have two recommendations. First, there are those hard plastic vibrators that are basically a cylinder that comes to a point ([like this](http://www.edenfantasys.com/vibrators/traditional-vibrators/little-pearls-vibrator) - NSFW). They are usually very easy to use, even with little to no lube... I never used the vibration functionality =) Be careful with anything made out of hard plastic though... don't go nuts with it. Also, be sure to not push it in all the way! Haha! My second recommendation is something made out of pure silicon. It's more expensive, but it's probably the best material for an anal toy. Rigid, yet malleable, easy to clean, etc. Search for toys that preferably have some kind of base, and are smaller than the average guy. That link above goes to a website that has a fantastic search feature! It allows you to specify the length and circumference of the toy you want... I'd recommend something with a circumference between 3 and 4 inches to start (the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis_size) - NSFW - says the average guy has a circumference of 4.85 inches, to give you a point of reference).

Anyway, other than that, use lube... condoms make clean up a little easier. **DO NOT** use condoms with spermicidal lubricant!! I've read that it may cause tears more easily. I recommend using very plain, untextured, unlubricated condoms and then buying a bottle of lube meant for anal. I find that a dab about the size of a pea is good enough for me, but YMMV. You want enough to cover the whole toy/penis.

I'll second the comment about putting down a towel. Actually, I never did, and I never had any problems, but it would probably be a good idea... I suppose it would depend on what position you do it in. Most common for me was with me, laying on my stomach, and my guy laying on top of me. Never had a problem that way.

I'd recommend a quick shower afterward for both you and your guy to wash off, with soap. Plus, it's a shower with your guy! Do you really need a reason for that? =)

I do *not* recommend a shower immediately beforehand. For me, it always made penetration harder.

Here's a trick doctor's use when they need to put something up your butt: they'll tell you to take a big, deep breath. Hold it for a second. Then they'll tell you to slowly exhale while they push in. Works well =)

Lastly, have fun! I *love* being on the receiving end! I think you'll find it enjoyable, too!","1262321154"

I ask this because during my last trip, I looked at humanity from what I thought was some sort of alien perspective...and my natural pessimism brought me to the conclusion that the human race was definitely going to fail.  In my extremely fucked up head at the time, I just KNEW that we'd never break free from this planet and reach other forms of life before extinction.  I also felt like all of Earth was slowly turning into a human ""slum"".

I really hope I'm wrong, but I still feel that it could be true.  If reason/science doesn't catch on, and consumerism continues to flourish (which it has been, for the most part...the human mold is growing), it's possible that we could fail, right?  :(

Anyways, feel free to share more if you'd like, I'm very curious.  This is by far the scariest thought I've ever had in my life before...that everything we are could turn out to be nothing at all.  I would describe it as ""hilarious"", even, in the darkest way imaginable.","1262321231"

The best would be intelligent filesystems like ZFS given a pool of SSD and hard disk, automatically keeping the most latency sensitive content in the SSD.  Bonus points if that content is also backed up on the spinning disks so that the failure of any drive does not lose data.","1262321242"

There's a risk that  suddenly the whole plot could turn into a god and devil fight and controlling everything from the beginning. This would lower the importance of the main characters, making them a secondary part of the whole plot and giving the chance to dismiss plenty of the mysteries, connections and background stories we want to be answered.

The very nature of the melting pot means that those who hail from all corners of the planet keep their culture, and share it with those who want to share it.

Try being a Uygur or Tibetan in any part of China.  If you're not Han, you get beaten down.  Try being a Copt or an atheist in Saudi Arabia, you get beaten down.  Only in America can an engineering major from Bangladesh study under a professor from Karachi without an eyebrow being raised.  Likewise, for most of the previous century a stevedore from Ulster would have no problem getting a haircut from a barber from Belfast, and his usual paper besides.

&gt;Mary - a woman favored by God, but still human and sinful

I see nothing wrong with this, except the 'sinful' - where does it say that she sinned?  The Bible deals fairly with its heroes, documenting their works in God's name, and their faults.  This is true in the old and new testament - look at Peter, for example.  But nothing of Mary is said regarding her faults, only her goodness.  Therefore I stand by the Immaculate Conception.  I don't go to the full lengths that many Catholics do, to say she died sinless (let there be a Catholic that can show me the error of my ways, if I am in error here.  God's will be done), but that she was born sinless, and sinless gave birth to Christ.  After that it is uncertain.  But as we assume many saints are in heaven, so too we assume Mary in Heaven - a good and reasonable assumption.","1262321374"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","|Well that is according to the council. .

I don't know where people make up this stuff. You have to virtually ignore the entire new testament to not see clearly that Jesus constantly referred to himself as God's son. Not just a general son like we would use but a begotten son who existed at the creation of the world. I mean the Gospel of John is virtually written with this entire context as it's basic framework. Here are just a few examples of direct apostolic and biblical evidence that he was the unique son of God:

Matthew 3:17 - At Jesus' baptism, the Father spoke from heaven saying, ""This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."" 

Matthew 16:13-18 - Peter confessed Jesus to be the Christ, the Son of the Living God. Jesus said that the Father Himself had revealed this to Peter, but He rejected as inadequate the claims that He was just a prophet. [John 6:69]

Matthew 17:5 - At the Transfiguration the Father again spoke from heaven saying, ""This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."" This is why we should listen to Him.

John 4:25,26 - Jesus acknowledged to the Samaritan woman that He was the Messiah (Christ).

John 9:35-37 - He told a blind man He had healed that He was the Son of God.

Matthew 26:63-66 - During His trial in the presence of His enemies, Jesus acknowledged that He was the Christ, the Son of God.

John 8:15-8:59  - Virtually states the entire teaching. 

|Well this is circular reasoning on your part. 

I don't see how it can be. You cannot call your self a Christian and teach that Jesus death on the cross either did not happen or was not for our sins. I don't know what you are but you are not Christian.

|The gift of eternal life is a direct teaching of Jesus (AKA scripture).

You don't need the bible to ask God to forgive you. You need the bible to help you walk out sanctification. We didn't even have a bible for what 1200 years and the church grew. Jesus said "" No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him"". God has been doing that since the first century. I can read this teaching today because it's 2009 and I now have a written bible. But Salvation never required scripture. Today it's used in proclaiming the Gospel and guiding people because there is a lot of good general wisdom in it but like I said lots of people live scriptural lives and don't get saved because god did not draw them.

|How do you know that this is not exactly what you are doing? 

Well first of all we are commanded to forgive in ALL circumstances. This includes rape, murder, adultery, and yes even Hitler. Punishment is reserved for God and civil government that he set up that man hasn't corrupted to the point of Saddam. That alone prevents us from implementing a huge section of old testament punishments. As for the sabbath we believe we are doing the right thing but if not we are covered by the cross so that the punishment for various issues we might be dead wrong about don't condemn us eternally. 

|Wow! You would actually do that to good people? 

In Luke Innocents were killed and Jesus replied to the situation.
Luke 13:1 There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered them, ""Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? 
No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish."" These apparently were good people but it didn't help them in Jesus's eyes either. The guy hanging on the cross next to Jesus and these people perished because they did not repent. 

|That would also mean that Christians who interpret Bible differently than you are not saved.

Likewise, people that interpret it exactly like I do. Because even if they are correctly interpreting it and they don't  repent and ask for a personal relationship with Christ in order to receive atonement it isn't going to help them. Look I know personally two men who were preachers for 20 years BEFORE they got saved. I mean bible thumping, faith healing, speak in tongue preachers who by every external definition you could think of appeared saved but by there own testimony were not and tell you the moment it happened.

|3.You said that as an atheist you were a bad person, but in this thread you said that you would throw normal people into the eternal hell fire. I don't think that as an atheist you would have done that. 

What in the world makes you think I'm a good person. Even by your definition. I have blood on my head from my youth. Even after becoming a Christian I struggle every day because of how arrogant and prideful I am sometimes. I used to love telling women they looked fat just because it would haunt them. I got off on mentally abusing people in order to belittle them and make myself feel important. Can you not at least appreciate the total and complete irony that God would even give someone like me the time of day much less grant him eternal life while at the same time casting out people who in my opinion are far far far more deserving of heaven than I will ever be. And they are all average people. As an Atheist I didn't care enough about them to worry about it but if it was between me and them sure I would have. Wouldn't of even given it a second thought. Like I said I was not exactly the nicest guy. Actually like you've noticed sometimes I'm still not. I still struggle with my nasty side a lot. 

As far as the soccer mom I could ask you the same question because I don't sit in Gods seat. I don't make the call. I said yes because I know I was going there and there list was just as long as mine. The fact is there is no good answer a person can make to that question. If I say yes I'm bad. If I say no then of course why wouldn't God let them off the hook too. God simply said we are ALL in danger of it. If someone spend their entire life disobeying you or ignoring you what would you do? You only have one alternative eternal life with everyone who honored you, obeyed you, had a personal relation ship with you and hell for everyone else. Not much of a choice. No grey area either since even if your deeds based their sin is thousand and thousands of times greater than their good deeds.

|This statement makes no sense. Light is not made out of molecules.

Early in my career I worked at Goddard Space Flight center in Maryland with the communication network on the Hubble. I hung out a lot with a group of optical space chemists. These are light wave experts. They are the ones who determine all the info about planets and stars etc. They pointed out to me once the physical properties of light. We can bend it, measure it, cause reactions by focusing it etc. We don't know precisely what it is composed of but we do know that it operates at wavelengths. Certain wavelengths can pass completely though objects. We sort of see this in X RAYs radio waves etc. At the molecular level of our bodies there is a huge amount of space between Atoms etc. One of them asked one time (in an argument over a star trek episode) why it seemed so impossible to me to believe that a spirit (made of light) could not exist inside a human body. It seemed perfectly possible and logical to them. I never thought about it until I stepped out of mine. That's one of the first things I though about later.

|So according to your logic, People that persecute Christians are as justified as Christians that persecute gays?

I'm not aware that Christians are executing gays like Iran and some other countries. Jesus taught that just like him we would not be loved by the world. One of the reasons we are not is that we oppose sinful things the world wants to do like homosexuality. But we also know that homosexuals are not condemned because they are gay. Like everyone else they have sin in their life. This particular one is opposed no differently that any other it's just that with things like abortion and homosexuality there are political issues involved. I mean you don't hear anyone screaming against Christians for opposing alcoholism, or drug use but boy when you try venture into the area of sex people start screaming because they simply will not be denied.  I mean we say don't have sex before your married. People say kiss off. They find every conceivable reason why that is a ridiculous position and pointless to even try. Then of course there are the inevitable pregnancies, abortions, nasty diseases, even deaths related to disease. All the while we are condemned for supporting a biblical position. I mean God knew we would have these problems if we engaged in this behaviour but he hasn't stopped man. He's got free will. So I would ask you, how do I reconcile Jesus clear command to oppose sin with a homosexual's desire to do what is specifically sinful?  

|Well vegetarian opposes you eating animals, not only because it hurts animals, but also because it is not good for you or the planet.

That's fine. It's not sin to oppose a Christian in that. There is no eternal consequence for it. And if he attacks me for it he does and I don't have a lot of control over that. What I would be more concerned about is has he made an idol out of vegetarianism. I was a vegetarian for a about 4 years. Still am mostly. I eat fish and a little chicken or meat once a month based on a restricted diet I am on.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;What makes you think that men are created with an inherent desire to seek and worship God?

I have no tangible proof.  Simply observation and personal experience.  Many religions share this viewpoint, not just Christianity.

&gt;I do not believe that we are capable of affecting a change in God's will.

Nor do I, but we act instead in the constraints his will allows.  And His will does allow us free will, which allowed the Original Sin, and allowed us to sin today.  

&gt;I don't think that free will is compatible with the existence of a Factually Perfect Bible.

I don't follow.  While man is imperfect, and even as a vessel of God's will we are imperfect, we are chosen not because we are perfect but for that very fact - that we are imperfect.

God chooses the broken and the worthless to show his Perfection and Glory to the world.  As an example: his ambassador to the Pharoah was quite possibly the worst possible choice: Moses, a man who (despite all his righteousness) was short-tempered, doubtful, and a stutterer.  He sends as his speaker a stutterer.  Imagine it.  Therefore the imperfect do perfect things to show that it is not them but God.  As it is with the Bible.","1262321647"

One downside is that it contains black pips which can be a nuisance to remove (again, they're quite similar to pumpkin pips, apart from colour), and this has lead to a very popular hybrid variety, which contains no pips - though these of course can't reproduce conventionally.

Also, the thing with a RP realm - I recommended because it does keep the kids away, but also keeps away your average ""Deathknightdk"" spamming around in /s /y or throwing around uninvited dueling requests around the ToC entrance and other things like that.
  
Be respectful to other people, respect the realm policies, don't be the type that logs on his cross-faction lvl1 alt to throw some shit talk on that paladin who just killed you.
  
For a guild to be successful you need some qualities as leader, which most people lack. I do not know anything about Elmanchosdiablos, but coming back this morning and seeing that the faction was decided by some 8 votes who were on New Year's Eve, only after a day this thread was up, definitely says something. Don't rush things.
  
You also need a few people for a (semi)core-group at the beginning which you know you can trust, who can aid you in leading. Throw some forums up where people can make proper applications where you can see a bit of the person they are, afterwards start the guild, things can progress from there.
  
Don't go ranting now for ""chill its a game lol"", I'm playing it and enjoy my quality time. Reddit is an awesome place and I'd love a guild which involves reddit users, but I'm not leaving my current raiding guild for a failed attempt. Just my 2c.

My thoughts on this are a bit lighter, maybe because I'm not so good at addressing heavy stuff and don't know doodle about school systems and social services and all.

No matter what speech or learning problems he might have, or ADD or Asperger stuff, he might feel very trapped at home, and, yes, it's a troubled home. I agree that his computer games and his silence are means of escape. (Heaven knows, I have a history of escaping into playing the piano or teaching myself computer programming languages when I live in a home that's too damn crowded psychologically!)

Is he capable of getting out and about on his own? Can he navigate the trains and sidewalks? In your assessment, does he need to worry about getting hassled by gangs? Going to *your* place for homework or lunch or local adventure or-heck--even some gaming might do him good. For one thing, it gets him out from under dad's thumb awhile. Second, he might be wired to really enjoy spending a lot of time alone, and traveling around on one's own is a good way to be ""alone"" even in the presence of thousands of people. At least the anonymous masses don't expect him to make clever conversation. Third, since dad is such a backwards stick-in-the-mud, he probably believes that venturing into the world for constructive activity is ""manly."" Your brother's 13, so, hey dad, he's a man already!

You cannot beg China for anything.  It shows weakness, and weakness is not respected, and they will not deal or negotiate under those circumstances.  There are no arguments or deals of no consequences, they all matter to the Chinese because they set up terms for the next deal.

The republic is pretty much the model of governance in North America. The U.S founding fathers not only drafted a masterpiece for the USA but for the entire world (if they choose to follow). Many governments in the 'free world' are modeled after this blueprint in some shape form or fashion. There is no competition to be ""better"" than anyone elses pledge or oath.

&gt;what are these forces (good vs evil) i am talking about? 

Seriously? dude? where have you been for the last 10 years? There are corporations (huge), and people on this planet very powerful ones who would rather see you dead or enslaved. When the US founding fathers broke away from the King, and drafted the constitution, they were in a very dark age, and wanted to ensure would never happen again. You are seriously lacking history.

&gt;There's the People's Republic of China. How are we different from them?

Both modern and ancient republics vary widely in their ideology and composition.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;vast bulk of the American public simply think and act in ways heavily dictated by the mass media and corporate spin.

Perhaps, but isn't it both ironic and revealing that what is trendy is what is considered decidedly anti-corporate? People in general are stupid and insecure, so of course they'll buy into trends and what talking heads tell them. But look at what these talking heads are selling them: the Tea Party movement gains all it's momentum from the collective belief that government run healthcare restricts individual freedoms, the most popular forms of music fit either into the genres of indie or hip-hop/rap, both of which are appealing at least in part because they're so anti-establishment.

&gt;If the U.S. really was a bastion of freedom and independence then it would not have the world's highest incarceration rate with corporate-run prisons full of people convicted of trivial victimless crimes.

I assume you're talking about drugs. I think you can blame the Puritans for that, Christianity has also had a pretty hefty influence on American morals. It's possible though to be fervently anti-drug and still admire individual expression and accomplishment.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Wow. Okay.

We did a section on the history of wages in the Remuneration section of my Diploma of HR, some years ago.

The Living Wage. That is, a wage on which a man might live. It came about following a [landmark court case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvester_Judgment), in which the Judge Hugh Victor McKay was very proactive about discovering the costs of living. Butchers and the like were asked to give evidence on the prices of meat, etcetera.

The thinking went something like this: A man who works hard all week should be able to support himself and his family to a certain standard of living, which might include occasional new clothes and meat regularly. The Harvester Judgment, and the publicity received, was a very important landmark in the process of Labor Reform here in Australia.

For more exact details, I'd have to go look up my notes or do some google searching.

In Australia, people are payed by the Award, which is the amount by law to which that job is entitled, and this usually boils down to an hourly rate. For example, and Industrial Cleaner gets something like $15 an hour. There are State and Federal awards, and by law the employer is required to pay whichever one is best. Awards also determine things like penalty rates and when they apply, casual loading (the percentage over the award rate that must be payed for not giving holiday pay, sick pay or notice when dismissing an employee, usually 20%), holiday pay loading, sick days etcetera.

To be frank, the minimum rates of pay here in Australia are much higher than the USA, and I think this affects every facet of our society.","1262322298"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Your language motivates me to start and complete my own in which the only novel concept is that it supports macros based on indentation (like four spaces means ""treat as code"" in Markdown, same idea but ""treat as X mini language""). Same as you, I start with how I'd like to write programs and reverse engineer it into an implementation.

    foo = let drinking-age = 18
              age = 21
              left = drinking-age - age
              agesq = age ²
              in do print your age is: $age
                    if age &gt;= 18
                       then print you can drink
                       else print wait $n years, kid

'let' is a macro. Everything after it has to line up one space after
it, to be used as text parsed by the 'let'. 'in' is a special part of
the macro indicating the body of the let. 'do' is a macro that
sequences actions. Likewise, 'print' is a macro that translates `your age is :$age` to: `append ""your age is :"" (show age)`.

The funky part is that '=' is also a macro, it parses mathematical
expressions to numbers. So it's easy to have lots of symbols mean different
things in different syntactic contexts. There's a space inbetween
'age' and '²' (and any other operators) because I'm pondering letting
variable names have arbitrary characters other than whitespace or
speech mark.

I hate `typingLikeThis`, and `typing_like_this` is nearly as expensive,
but `the-lisp-way` is so lovely. Obviously `a-b` could be read as `a - b`, so making spaces significant solves this.

I've already got a [lexer/half-parser
done](http://www.refactory.org/s/indentation_based_syntax_parser_tokenizer/view/latest)
(though that prototype needs re-implementing properly). It's pretty
fun getting the indentation to be significant.

But the parser needs a macro parser and evaluator which I can't do
until I've done the evaluator, which I may just do as a purely
functional mini-lang. It's really about what fun one can have with the
syntax.","1262322466"
"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;  ...women explain their belief in “emotional” terms (“emotional comfort, a desire for meaning and purpose in

So basically women believe in god because they're too emotional to think rationally? And empirical thinking is just a ""guy thing""? I am sick of the notion that having a uterus precludes the ability to think logically.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;because you can't stop people from doing drugs, you shouldn't?

It isn't realistic to say that you can stop people from doing drugs. If people really want drugs there will be a way for them to get drugs. Whether they are in jail, prison, home, or Canada. The best that can be done is to legalize and educate people on the dangers of substance abuse. 

&gt;Laws don't stop people from murdering each other either, should we abolish those and let people have at it?

You know that would be silly. I know you were trying to be sarcastic, and it's cute, but seriously, murdering somebody carries far greater negative consequences for society. 

Doing drugs can lead to addiction, which can, and does, destroy families. People should not have to be wary about facing jailtime in order to seek needed help. Also, what happens to the families of those who wind up in prison for drug ""offenses?"" Do they really benefit from having someone placed in an environment that creates and reinforces criminal behavior? Or would it make more sense to try and rehabilitate addicts and mend families?

Also on topic, Teenagers today say that it is much easier to get drugs than it is to get alcohol. That is because the black market is obviously not regulated, and there are no more penalties for the guy who plays WoW and sells drugs than the dealer slinging meth to kids.  ","1262322526"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First, thanks for your response.  I am blessed by the opportunity to discuss this with you.

I made a statement about God and the randomness of nature previously [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/ajtd4/question_for_christians/c0hy5bf).

To say whether good things are all from God we'd first have to define Good.  Do we mean what man thinks is good?  Then surely not.  Some of which man thinks is good is from God, but some is from nature's randomness (which, indirectly or directly, is God's Will), or man's free will at work (we have free will under the constraints of God's Will - that is we would not have free will without God's Will).

Instead, I prefer to define Good as ""that which is God's will.""  And Evil as ""that which goes against God's will.""  I do not pretend to understand everything that is or is not God's Will, and I pray to understand it further.

Sin is therefore evil not because it is a bad thing in man's eyes (though it sometimes is), but because it acts as an obstacle in the relationship between creation and Creator.

As for the actions of supposed Christians, Christ says a tree is judged by its fruit.  So we can, at least sufficiently if not perfectly, determine within the confines of a given church whether a member should be admonished.  

How many people call themselves by the name of Christ and are yet opposed to him with all they do?  Many.  Far too many.  As Christ himself says, [""I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!""](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:15-24&amp;version=NIV)

"sex","t5_2qh3p","tl;dr:  got road head while driving a golf cart at burning man.

So I decide to go to Burning Man for the first time.  I had been hearing about the festival for years, but never got my shit together enough to go.  Then one day, a friend approached me and said that he wanted to go and that I should come.  Uh, twist my arm.

So we roll out there in style and get permission to bring a golf cart with us for transport on the playa.  We arrive on site, and immediately I have my mind blown by what I'm seeing.  the art is massive, the DJs are amazing and the desert is breathtaking.  Not to mention the fact that everyone is so nice, welcoming and sexually free sprited.  Lots of skin, very few boundaries, etc.

Anyway after a few days of setting up our art installation, we start getting friendly with some of our neighbors.  They're just as excited to be there as we are.  I meet this chick and we quickly begin to hit it off; she and I work in the same fields, were both first timers at burning man, both completely mindfucked from the event, etc.  We eventually decide to take a cruise out of our camp and check out the sites.  Of course, we take the golf cart that we had at our disposal.

After we hit up some of the dance camps, get some drinks at a couple of the bars, smoke some herb, generally get closer, we decide to take the golf cart away from some of the action and out into the deeper parts of the playa.  

While still sitting in the cart, we start to make out.  Making out leads to some boobie feelin'.  Touching boobs eventually leads to fingering her pussy and getting her to the point where she can't maintain anymore.  The next thing I know, she's going for my junk - which at this point is bursting out of my shorts.  She unzips me, pulls out my cock and immediately goes to town.  I popped pretty quickly, but that didn't stop her.  She then proceeded to completely drain my cock, sucking it for a good 5 minutes after I blew my load.  super hot.

All while I was driving the golf cart.

after we both satisfy each other, she asks me if I'm interested in coming to LA at some point and having a three some with her and her girlfriend.  Yeah, I'm a dumbass and lost her number....","1262322583"

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","Great! In season 5, Episode 2 titled [Darmok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok), Picard has to deal with an alien culture in which their primary mode of communication is through metaphor. The problem is: the Enterprise crew has no knowledge of their cultural history and as such lacks a context in which to make sense of the metaphors they're using! 

A quote from the episode goes something like (and this is an Enterprise crew member talking) ""If I wanted to explain an emotion to you in their way, I could say ""Juliet on the balcony,"" but you would have no way of understanding what I'm trying to express without knowing a wealth of cultural references."" 

So, what I propose to you is this: You write an essay on a subject of your choosing from this episode. (I must say now it is a particularly annoying episode because of the extremely repetitious use of the phrase ""Darmok and Jilad at Tenagra) But...this essay must be written entirely with metaphoric references that still manage to convey the meaning of your analysis...which of course must be graduate level, as you put it.

As incentive...I will begin work immediately on an abstract guitar work of no less than 30 minutes length that I shall write while interpreting the melange of emotional responses I get from watching the show...hence...improvising while watching the show. Your essay will serve as the liner notes for this album, a copy of which I will gladly mail to you upon completion! What do you say?

"apple","t5_2qh1f","The one you are thinking of dropping is the Poly-carb emate. the ""Al"" PowerBooks dent easily - and an 8 foot drop will easily split one into two pieces (yes, I have seen the aftermath). The unibody enclosure does not dent as easily, but the housings sure do. my 15"" Unibody has a big fat dent in it's display housing where it hit a curb form 18"" up - while in a padded brenthaven bag. I usually consider it impervious to dents in that bag. 

Chroko may be right about the issues, but he does not see the long line of issues Apple has worked to solve to bring some of the sexiest products around into existence.  the PowerBook line easily comes to mind. 

Beginning with the PowerBook G4 Titanium - Apple Laptops were the Formula 1 cars of the Laptop world - they were the fastest available - until they touched the wall. Then there were problems. for PC people (and many Mac people) used to Polycarb laptops that were clunky but rugged , people would mistreat the svelte but somewhat more fragile PowerBooks. The Unibody macs finally solved this issue, in most respects. 

the titanium PBG4 released in 2000 were sexy - but were too thin. The Poly-carb edges would crack on impact or come off the epoxy holding them to the titanium sheets that made up the center of the cases. Then the paint would chip/scratch, and the Black poly-carb or the orangey-steel colored titanium would show. The hinges had a terrible weak point (lower frame screw mount hole) to keep the display so thin.  This design was made with the thermal envelope of the G3 in mind (very small heatsink &amp; 20mm fan) and as the G4's got hotter, many many compromises inside were made to keep adding extra heat pipes. the 1GHZ units were the hottest things I have ever seen until the Original Core1 MBPs. This design was overall too thin at the time, with most people used to the Rugged polycarb G3's or iBooks, though Apple mitigated the paint issue later with better coatings.

The Aluminum PBG4  models in 2003 were the answer to those issues.  There was no poly-carb edges, no paint, and was thicker to accommodate the growing heat given off by the next revision G4 chips. The wide inset flush hinge in the rear of the case showed up - (which is still predominantly the same design found today) got rid of the protruding hinges on the G4 or the exposed hinge bezels found even today on most laptops.  The aluminum was softer, so there is no cracking on drop - but deformed like a car in an accident. The case pieces were held together with spot welds (to hold screw mounts to the thick outer case, for example), and where the cases met at an edge, there was a plastic runner because there still was no way to accurately make the all-aluminum bodies meet up flush and stay that way over time. the case pieces and their internally spot-wleded attachments would get deformed in a drop and never would go easily back together without complete replacement. The outer shell was not rigid enough, so over time it would bend slightly, and the internal frame was not strong enough to prevent it.  Hooks found on the originals would be easily damaged and not re-hook, and the entire CD mouth area on all units was very weak, and would get bent down by repeated one-hand pickups. The shitty hooks were quickly replaced with tab snaps, still found on many units. 

the 17"" model had a better battery placement and internal design than the 15"", and the 12"" was a complete nightmare of stacked parts. It is amazing to see how they crammed the G4 in. My first time taking one apart to remove the Optical drive took almost 5 hours - I'm down to about an hour now, after about 100 units. 
 
Cut to the MacBook Pros in 2006 - the revision of the case was minimal, though all units were modeled after the 17"" PBG4. the Hotter Core1 was amazingly able to work in there. Logic board design had been updated, and more closely resembled the 15"" PBG4. 

The Unibody design in late 2008 - is the ultimate solution to the issues brough up with the PBG4 Titanium units - it's thickness in the edges resists denting that would normally heavily damage a earlier model, the supreme rigidity of the case means an internal frame is no longer needed, the CD mouth is very strong, and there is a very limited number of spot welds needed for just secondary covers (the bottom and battery door). The design could finally scale down to the consumer portable MacBook, unifying the overall design of the product lines for the first time since the consumer portable model had been conceived by Apple with the release of the drastically different iBook G3 clamshell in 1999. Even the iBook 12"" and PowerBook G4 12"" were radically different machines inside. 

True - these were all design compromises that led to issues in the real world - be it materials or manufacturing process problems, - but Apple works through them to find wonderful solutions - and keeps working at them. Apple has to deal with this because they are at the forefront of design - not following along like everyone else. How many other ""PC manufacturers"" have an R&amp;D budget measured in Billions?

The issues with the discoloration of the MacBook's plastic &amp; HS issues, Sony Battery swelling issues in the MBP, and now the issues now with the 27"" units' GPU's are all things that befall a company straining to try new things and fresh designs is risky - and getting your name dragged through the mud for OEM failures (the Battery, 17"" GPU issues, etc) is the name of the game.

Thing is though - planes and airports are great targets as that is where most of america's business comes through!

People who can afford plane tickets in this country are people who are in power more or less. 

Would it be more easy to place packages in a city? Well - first you have to get these people into the country, but how do terrorists acquire explosives in America?

I was asking myself recently about why D&amp;D derived products seem to have such a hard time outside of their traditional medium; I think it has to do with the fact that D&amp;D (and its ilk) requires imagination - no two DMs will play by exactly the same rules, and most of the game takes place inside each of the players' heads - whereas pinning down the essence of D&amp;D in, say, a MMO doesn't allow for the true beauty of the system to shine through.

Another question I had was ""when do adults use imagination?"" Children at the elementary level are asked to do so almost daily, but grownups seem to never really get the same number of opportunities. I wonder if tabletop gamers tend to be more empathetic (have to imagine how others would feel in response to their actions), more creative, etc than a comparable population of non-gamers?

Actually I would argue Indie is perhaps a corrupt extension of American cultural trends emphasizing individual expression; we don't try to be individuals to create anymore, we act as individuals because it's fashionable. It's now trendy to be not trendy. However, it's worth asking where this trend came from, why being anti-establishment is a marketable quality.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;It isn't realistic to say that you can stop people from doing drugs. 

No, it simply isn't realistic based on what you've seen so far. If drugs were to be effectively stamped out over time through a persistent fight against it, I could very easily see drugs being *much* harder for anyone to come by. The point being that you can't hold current progress against the fundamental concept.

&gt;If people really want drugs there will be a way for them to get drugs. Whether they are in jail, prison, home, or Canada. 

Same with murder. 

&gt;The best that can be done is to legalize and educate people on the dangers of substance abuse.

lol, says you? 

&gt;You know that would be silly. I know you were trying to be sarcastic, and it's cute, but seriously, murdering somebody carries far greater negative consequences for society.

*whooooosh*

&gt;Doing drugs can lead to addiction, which can, and does, destroy families. People should not have to be wary about facing jailtime in order to seek needed help. Also, what happens to the families of those who wind up in prison for drug ""offenses?"" Do they really benefit from having someone placed in an environment that creates and reinforces criminal behavior? Or would it make more sense to try and rehabilitate addicts and mend families?

Whether or not *use* or possession of small amounts of drugs should lead to incarceration is a separate argument entirely, but as suggested, it is very rare for someone to  face jailtime for having small amounts on them. Jailtime usually results with intent to sell, which is considerably worse ethically than someone who is 'seeking needed help' or experimenting. 

&gt;and there are no more penalties for the guy who plays WoW and sells drugs than the dealer slinging meth to kids.

do you know what kind of time anyone even possessing meth faces vs the standard drug dealer bust?

I have been called weird by people that do not like me, but that's not what I am focused on. Afterall, weird to me means different, which can be an expression against change... 

I have been called selfish, but what is selfishness, or thinking in the best interests of yourself? I am not taking things per se, but the world is our playground, and life is our recess. My life is full of events I have termed Weird/Normal. A W/N is like when a song is stuck in your head and you turn the radio on to find it playing. I find it practically a game of probability/statistics, essentially. But once I noticed the pattern, I feel I can accurately guess things, including other people's motives often times. I am glad to live in modern times, where heretics are no longer burned at the stake.

&gt;Although conventional wisdom says that the new decade begins on January 1st, 2010, technically it doesn't begin until January 1st, 2011. 

&gt;The reason the new decade doesn't begin until 2011 is because there was no year 0---the calendar began at year 1. Since a decade is ten years, the very first decade was comprised of year 1 through year 10. The second decade was year 11-20, and so on. 

&gt;The 201st decade was 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. 
The 202nd decade is 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Re-encouraging their subscribers to become more tech savvy:

I think the instructions will likely confuse most people enough that they will get really frustrated. They should create a site that lets you choose three drop downs: computer OS &amp; version, Computer connections with graphic, Television connections with graphic, then tailors a diagram to their needs. The video should merely explain that the setup will make the television behave like a second monitor to the computer, how to choose the input on the tv, and set the displays control panel once connected. An overview of what they need to do is more important than a counter-productive, and confusing attempt to explain the details. For example, something like DVI -&gt; HDMI will be necessary for a large number of people, but contrary to what will likely be inferred, they will still need a separate audio cable.

If most TWC customers have a cable box with its own tuner, the best solution by far is to leave the cable box attached to one of the inputs and attach a cheap antenna to the RF input in order to use the television's built in tuner. Over the air HDTV has far better picture quality than the overly-compressed channels transmitted by cable companies.

[New York city](http://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/lineup_web/US:10001#lineup_1171538) has a dozen 1080i broadcast channels and nearly 80 in total. All of the major networks are covered, and there are actually *more* PBS stations than are found on Time Warner Cable in Manhattan.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Heh. During the dot com boom, I was in charge of credit card fraud for a good sized online retailer (now gone). I wrote all of our fraud detection scripts and one day one of the alarms went off. A half dozen people all logged in, created new accounts, went straight to the gift certificate section and bought gift certificates for a couple hundred bucks all for the same person. This was a blatantly obvious case of someone stealing a bunch of credit cards and buying themselves gift certificates. Or so I thought. As I looked into it, it was odd that the thief was so meticulous in setting up the accounts. All of the billing addresses were complete and typed in proper case. And the IPs were from all over: NYC, Denver, Dallas, etc. I decide to give these customers a call and ask if they indeed wanted to make the purchases they did. None answered the phone, but I left messages for them to call me back to verify their purchases.

Next, I looked at the account of the recipient. Someone in a small town in Ohio. Email address: bitchybeauty@something.com. Google ""bitchy beauty"". Hmm, some kind of dominatrix. Surf her site. Hey! There's one of our high dollar products on her site with a demand that someone buy it from her. Holy crap. I figure it out. These dudes all just logged on, set up accounts, and sent her gift certificates. At this point, I'm pretty sure it's not fraud, but I guess my prurient interests kept me digging.

I look at the ""private"" messages on the gift certificates. They're all like ""Please accept this paltry amount Mistress. I know I am worthless. This is all I have."" I look up the personal account info of bitchy beauty herself. Her real name and shipping address is there. And phone number. I give her a call, use her real name, and tell her I'm a fraud investigator. I ask her to explain the transactions. At this point, I understand the whole thing of course. And I'm cool with people getting off however they please. But I wanted to hear her explain her business to someone who might think she's a freak or something. I don't know why, I just acted very serious. She was awesome. She explained her whole business to me totally straight up. No shame whatsoever. All business. I asked her a few questions and let her know I was satisfied from a fraud-perspective. Then she get all sultry on me, ""Have you ever been dominated?""

""What!? Uhh. I... don't... think so.""

""You sound like the kind of guy who might like it.""

""Heh heh. Well, it's never dawned on me to ask my girlfriend to try it, but who knows. Maybe I would.""

She switches to this matter-of-fact tone and gives me some friendly advice, ""Tell her to treat you like shit for a while. See if you like it.""

""Alright. I'll consider it. Thanks and good luck.""

The development costs for a specialty monitor like I envision would be high, but not nearly so high as the costs for an equivalent system that would also come with a built-in computer. After all, if it's total crap and no one buys it, it could still be a perfectly serviceable (albeit pricey) monitor for those who made the accident of purchasing it, but if the same thing is done with a tablet computer, all of the sudden the manufacturer stops supporting the system and what everyone's stuck with is instead a rather embarrassing mediocre novelty computer. Basically, it would be more likely a success, and likely more successful, as something that a mildly profitable graphic design firm could try out with their existing computers and then possibly buy more of, than as a probable total flop.

This has practically nothing to do with a potential market for tablets, and everything to do with a small, specialized market segment that is typically willing to pay a premium to increase their productivity. Which I imagine such a device would do, if done right.","1262323374"

"reddit.com","t5_6","What I would say is first things first, get yourself a good suit.  Best you can afford.  You'll need shoes, leather soled - none of this rubber soled junk.  Get a pair of oxfords at least, possibly a pair of brogues and loafers.  Florsheim's are decent, but aim for Dacks if you can afford them.

You need some good shirts.  Brooks Brothers in New York has some good shirts at decent prices - mind, these aren't particularly cheap.  But good clothes are worth the money.  Go for french cuffs and some nice cufflinks.  Pick out some ties, make sure they're silk - if you can afford it, pick up a tie or two from Hermes.

Pick up a navy blazer with brass buttons, and a pair or two of grey flannel trousers.  The navy blazer with grey flannel pants is a classic look, in fact it is the casual dress worn by Fred Astaire.  To really do it up to the nines, you'll need a fedora.  This is worth doing, there are very few men who don't look great in these clothes.

An important adjunct is grooming.  Go to a barber and get a proper haircut - stylists tend to give men a short woman's haircut.  It doesn't look right.  I'll often use a little bit of brylcreem.  Trim nails short and neat.  You should use a wet shave.  There two ways to get the best shave - the one, is to use a gillette Mach 3 razor.  The second is with a straight razor.  Straight razor's require a certain amount of skill.

Get some soap, and invest in a quality boar bristle shaving brush.  Shave after you've showered.  The hot water softens your beard.  Lather up the soap and put it on your face.  Then shave with the grain.  Some men with a lighter beard can then do a touch up shave against the grain, that'll get the ""smooth as a baby's bottom"" feel.  Once you're done shaving, here comes the hard part.  Run the tap and get the coldest water you can.  Then splash it on your face.  It's a shock, but it'll help with any possible irritation and will close small razor cuts.

If you go for cologne, use it sparingly.  The nose adjusts over time, so after about an hour you stop smelling it - but the smell is still on you.  The scent should be subtle enough that people don't consciously recognize that it's there.  Just a drop or two is enough.","1262323384"

She never had any kids, so her dogs were her kids.  Actually, the last one is the one that hurt my heart the worst.  When he got to where he couldn't hardly move around, I would drive about 60 miles every other day to go visit him, and I would take him treats and toys.  His favorite was a little lamb shaped squeaky toy that I had gotten for him, and even though he ripped the squeaky out within 15 minutes of my giving it to him, he carried it everywhere, and when he went to sleep, he would rest it on top of his front paws, and then rest his chin on top of it. Even when he was euthed, he had it with him.

She kind of went nuts after that, not that I blame her.  But she became vicious enough towards everyone, that I really didn't care to be around her anymore, either.

Moving forward in time entropy will increase to maximum at which point the state can remain unchanging forever unless something else is introduced into the system so the only stable, unchanging configuration is maximum chaos.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I didn't read every single word of the linked page.  But enough to get the picture.

I am all for religious tolerance, and I saw many things I agreed with in my short time on that site.  That said, we have to understand what tolerance is, at least for a Christian.

Tolerance means to tolerate.  Not to embrace, but to tolerate.  To allow to exist in peace.

But we can never forget that we believe that Christ is the ""way truth and life"" and that there is no way to the Father but by him.  To deny this is no different than to defile the graves of martyrs, and laugh at their bones, saying they died for nothing.  More than that even - to call Christ a liar or a madman.

In addition, we must share the Gospel.  We must defend (with reasonable discourse) our beliefs when questioned or when we are presented with mistruth about our beliefs.  We are to live - and this is of immense importance - a life of the Example of Christ.  And, with other believers, we are to repel heresy and admonish fault.

That said, there is another side of this coin.  Yes, on this side we have believers who reject the things I'm saying in interest of peace.  Please tell me how you follow Christ without listening to his words?  On the other side (and I believe there are more believers doing this than the other), we have excessiveness in the secular realms.

There are those who go beyond what the Bible tells us to do (share gospel, serve the widows and orphans - that is, liive by example, defend our beliefs in discourse).   They get involved in politics.  There are those who would even see a Theocracy.  As many Calvinists have believed, that we are to bring a literal heavenly kingdom to earth's populace.  This is clearly not so, and in error.  

Do what the Bible says, and you'll be OK.  

But yes, we should tolerate others, of course.  ","1262323816"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Tonight, a girl calls me from inside a pounding dance club. Her only words I can make out are ""behind.""

She says, ""asshole.""

She says what could be ""muffin"" or ""nothing."" The fact of the matter is you can't begin to fill in the blanks so I'm in the kitchen, alone and yelling to be heard over the dance mix wherever. She sounds young and worn out, so I ask if she'll trust me. Is she tired of hurting? I ask if there's only one way to end her pain, will she do it?

My goldfish is swimming around all excited inside the fishbowl on the fridge so I reach up and drop a Valium in its water.

I'm yelling at this girl: has she had enough?

I'm yelling: I'm not going to stand here and listen to her complain.

To stand here and try to fix her life is just a big waste of time. People don't want their lives fixed. Nobody wants their problems solved. Their dramas. Their distractions. Their stories resolved. Their messes cleaned up. Because what would they have left? Just the big scary unknown.

Most people who call me already know what they want. Some want to die but are just looking for my permission. Some want to die and just need a little encouragement. A little push. Someone bent on suicide won't have much sense of humor left. One wrong word, and they're an obituary the next week. Most of the calls I get, I'm only half listening anyway. Most of the people, I decide who lives and who dies just by the tone of their voice.

This is getting nowhere with the girl at the dance club so I tell her, Kill yourself.

She's saying, ""What?""

Kill yourself.

She's saying, ""What?""

Try barbiturates and alcohol with your head inside a dry cleaning bag.
    
She says, ""What?""

You cannot bread a veal cutlet and do a good job with only one hand so I tell her, now or never. Pull the trigger or don't. I'm with her right now. She's not going to die alone, but I don't have all night.

"politics","t5_2cneq","From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_police#History):

&gt; There is evidence that private police can provide services more cheaply than public police. The cost of San Francisco's private patrol specials is $25-30/hour, compared to $58/hour for an off-duty police officer.[1] In Reminderville, Corporate Security outbid the Summit County Sheriff Department's offer to charge the community $180,000 per year for 45-minute response time emergency response service by offering a $90,000 contract for twice as many patrol cars and a 6-minute response time.[2]

&gt; This system might also better prevent poor service and other abuses, as citizens could unilaterally fire their police company, rather than having to lobby the government to do so, an effort that many would be relatively disinclined to pursue, due to the uncertainty as to whether it would be successful, and the time consumed.

...

&gt; The ability of people to sue private police could be another safeguard.

etc, etc, etc.

It seems pretty much the only argument against privatized police is that the poor cannot afford it.  That's a bunch of bull .. and is typical of statists as it's the *de facto* fall back when lacking substantive arguments.

My point is that you can't protect everyone from everyone else.  Life is always full of risk, but it is still much safer for me to fly with existing security then it is for me to drive.

    print (film.name) for each film where

    print (film.name) for each film where

    print (film.name) for each film where (some actor in film.credits has name (film.director.name))

    &amp;&amp; film.credits include some actor with name ""Harrison Ford""
    &amp;&amp; credits for (some actor with name ""Harrison Ford"") include film
    &amp;&amp; (some actor with name ""Harrison Ford"").credits include film

    (@a) @include (@b) :- b in a
    (@a) @includes (@b) :- b in a
    (@a) @satisfy (@b) :- (bool) a.(b)
    (@a) @satisfies (@b) :- (bool) a.(b)
    (@a) @where (@b) :- iteration (for each a ((a satisfies b)? a: nil))
    @with (@b)(@c) :- value where (b is c)
    (@a) @has (@b)(@c) :- a @have b c :- a satisfies (b is c)
    @named (@b) :- with name b

    so for example
    first actor named ""Ice Cube""
    first (actor) with name (""Ice Cube"")
    first (actor) where (name is (""Ice Cube""))
    first (iteration (for each (actor) ((actor satisfies (name is (""Ice Cube""))? actor: nil))))
    first (iteration (for each (actor) ((actor.(name is (""Ice Cube""))? actor: nil))))

    so we have two kinds of function precedence:
    ""first"" and ""where"" take everything that follow them. ""in"" takes the next expression.

    first a in b where c -&gt; first(a in(b) where(c))
    first a where c in b -&gt; first(a where(c in(b)))

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Firstly, know that Allah is ""God"" in arabic. I would research the position of Jesus within Islam, it will probably be most interesting in that short amount of time you have. And remember, the basics of Islam are:

* To believe in one and only one God and to associate no partners with Him in worship
* To believe in all His angels
* To believe in all the prophets and messengers
* Belief in all the holy books (which He revealed)
* To believe in the day of judgement and the resurrection
* To believe in the power of divine decree- both of good and harm.

Belief in this things, as they were revealed to His final Prophet, Muhammad peace be upon him, are what makes someone a Muslim. Rejecting any part of this removes someone from the fold of Islam.

There are 5 pillars of Islam, which every Muslim MUST perform. They are:

* Sahada(testimony of faith): ""[I profess that] There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Prophet.""
* The five daily prayers
* Alms-giving (zakat)
* Fasting in the month of Ramadan
* Making the pilgrimate (hajj) if one is able to do so (i.e. not ill, and can afford it)

Performing all of these perfectly, and abstaining from the major sins, guarantees you protection from hell fire, and entry into paradise by virtue of Allah's grace (note: by the mercy of Allah, not by virtue of the actions)

Neglecting to perform any one of these intentionally makes someone a major sinner in and of itself, but they remain Muslim as long as they do not knowingly deny that the pillars are required. Failing to do any of these pillars means the person has no guarantee to be saved from hell fire. Allah may spare him entirely, or may punish him, as He wills. But even if they are punished, they will not remain in hell eternally, as long as they had faith.

The last people to come out of hell fire are those who had an atom's weight of faith in their hearts and believed there was no other god except Allah.","1262324162"

the command:  

    sudo pmset -c -a dps 0 reduce 0
is the one you want. I have not tested it. I would have to assume that ""dps 0"" means ""turn off monitoring"" and ""reduce 0"" means ""don't turn the speed down"". pmset = power manager set and sudo is the command to run something as a super user. ""super user do"". You will need to type in your password after executing the command. To revert it, you'd type   

    sudo pmset -c -a dps 1 reduce 0

EDIT: In case the fan starts going crazy or doesn't turn on at all anymore, you can reset the PMU (power managment unit). The instructions for doing so vary, so i'll just link to the apple [support](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1431). This will reset any pmset command you might accidentally type to the defaults.

I'm not saying pressure from one's peers isn't influential, but I'm saying that proper disciplinary and moral foundations have to be introduced before puberty, and this can in most cases be done.

Proper parenting starts from birth, and if proper enough, a few years of teenaged angst and hormonal impulses won't interfere with the teachings wired into the child's brain. It's not a house of cards, where you work on it for so long, yet it can be broken down with one push.","1262324302"

I didn't grow up in the US -- I grew up in France, and in France culturally there are a few differences that in my opinion make a lot more difference than ""working less"":

1. We don't eat in between meals.  In fact, most restaurants aren't even open between meals.

2. When we eat, we eat in far, far smaller quantities than Americans do.

In France, seeing a 350lb man slurping down a 64oz cola would be unheard of, for reasons unrelated to the metric system.

In fact, we don't even eat healthily -- French people eat more saturated fat and exercise less than the European average.  We just don't eat as much.","1262324339"

I met a girl in law school, and we were really tight- but I moved away from her, and we don't talk too often anymore.

I've never been anti-social- but most people I make friends with are just drifting through my life.  I know they're just temporary passers-by.

I've learned to accept that some people are friends for the here-and-now, and not destine to stick around forever.

Some of the ones I thought were keepers didn't feel that way about me- and they drifted away in spite of my best efforts.

Sometimes I'm the asshole, and I just ignore people that I'm done with.

Be quick to forgive.
Be open minded.

Traits are selected for that increase one's ability and one's species' ability to reproduce. These happen to also coincide with things that most humans consider to be ""good"". Coincidence? Not at all. We're pre-programmed with these attitudes (don't marry your sister, don't kill other people, etc.) so that we can ensure the survival of, primarily, our own genes, and genes similar to our own (such as those of other humans). Evolution is most certainly not undirected: it tends toward animals that are more suitable adapted for their niche. If, however, you mean that evolution does not strive to achieve any other ideal than that, then yes, that's true, but it's not totally random, or it would make no sense at all. Either way, however, it must be true that traits that are selected for are good (or at least harmless). Evolution helps to ensure the survival of the species, and if this is not good for that species, then nothing could possibly be good.

&gt;This is an ethical issue not a scientific one.

No, it's very much a scientific one, as much as it is an ethical one. We're being asked for a rational (and, I assume, logical) explanation of morality, for some kind of way to tell intrinsically what behaviors are good and bad. Bad behaviors, those that harm oneself or one's fellow animals, are selected against. Obviously, given the relative timescales of evolution and our own lifespans, it couldn't possibly be that evolution is always ""right"" for every organism (poisonous plants, for example), but in the long run, there's nothing wrong with what I've said.","1262324486"

Testing, testing. One, two, three. Testing, testing. One, two, three.
    Maybe this is working. I don't know. If you can even hear me, I don't know.
    But if you can hear me, listen. And if you're listening, then what you've found is the story of everything that went wrong. This is what you'd call the flight recorder of Flight 2039. The black box, people call it, even though it's orange, and on the inside is a loop of wire that's the permanent record of all that's left. What you've found is the story of what happened.
    And go ahead.
    You can heat this wire to white-hot, and it will still tell you the exact same story.
    Testing, testing. One, two, three.
    And if you're listening, you should know right off the bat the passengers are at home, safe. The passengers, they did what you'd call their deplaning in the New Hebrides Islands. Then, after it was just him and me back in the air, the pilot parachuted out over somewhere. Some kind of water. What you'd call an ocean.
    I'm going to keep saying it, but it's true. I'm not a murderer.
    And I'm alone up here.
    The Flying Dutchman.
    And if you're listening to this, you should know that I'm alone in the cockpit of Flight 2039 with a whole crowd of those little childsized bottles of mostly dead vodka and gin lined up on the place you sit at against the front windows, the instrument panel. In the cabin, the little trays of everybody'sChicken Kiev or Beef Stroganoff entr‚es are half eaten with the air conditioner cleaning up any leftover food smell. Magazines are still open to where people were reading. With all the seats empty, you could pretend everyone's just gone to the bathroom. Out of the plastic stereo headsets you can hear a little hum of prerecorded music.
    Up here above the weather, it's just me in a Boeing 747-400 time capsule with two hundred leftover chocolate cake desserts and an upstairs piano bar which I can just walk up to on the spiral staircase and mix myself another little drink.
    God forbid I should bore you with all the details, but I'm on autopilot up here until we run out of gas. Flame out, the pilot calls it. One engine at a time, each engine will flame out, he said. He wanted me to know just what to expect. Then he went on to bore me with a lot of details about jet engines, the venturi effect, increasing lift by increasing camber with the flaps, and how after all four engines flame out the plane will turn into a 450,000-pound glider. Then since the autopilot will have it trimmed out to fly in a straight line, the glider will begin what the pilot calls a controlled descent.
    That kind of a descent, I tell him, would be nice for a change. You just don't know what I've been through this past year.
    Under his parachute, the pilot still had on his nothing special blah-colored uniform that looked designed by an engineer. Except for this, he was really helpful. More helpful than I'd be with someone holding a pistol to my head and asking about how much fuel was left and how far would it get us. He told me how I could get the plane back up to cruising altitude after he'd parachuted out over the ocean. And he told me all about the flight recorder.
    The four engines are numbered one through four, left to right.
    The last part of the controlled descent will be a nosedive into the ground. This he calls the terminal phase of the descent, where you're going thirty-two feet per second straight at the ground. This he calls terminal velocity, the speed where objects of equal mass all travel at the same speed. Then he slows everything down with a lot of details about Newtonian physics and the Tower of Pisa.
    He says, ""Don't quote me on any of this. It's been a long time since I've been tested.""
    He says the APU, the Auxiliary Power Unit, will keep generating electricity right up to the moment the plane hits the ground.
    You'll have air-conditioning and stereo music, he says, for as long as you can feel anything.
    The last time I felt anything, I tell him, was a ways back. About a year ago. Top priority for me is getting him off this plane so I can finally set down my gun.
    I've clenched this gun so long I've lost all feeling.
    What you forget when you're planning a hijack by yourself is somewhere along the line, you might need to neglect your hostages just long enough so you can use the bathroom.
    Before we touched down in Port Vila, I was running all over the cabin with my gun, trying to get the passengers and crew fed. Did they need a fresh drink? Who needed a pillow? Which did they prefer, I was asking everybody, the chicken or the beef? Was that decaf or regular?
    Food service is the only skill where I really excel. The problem was all this meal service and rushing around had to be one-handed, of course, since I had to keep ahold of the gun.
    When we were on the ground and the passengers and crew were deplaning, I stood at the forward cabin door and said, I'm sorry. I apologize for any inconvenience. Please have a safe and enjoyable trip and thank you for flying Blah-Blah Airlines.
    When it was just the pilot and me left on board, we took off again.
    The pilot, just before he jumps, he tells me how when each engine fails, an alarm will announce Flame Out in Engine Number One or Three or whichever, over and over. After all the engines are gone, the only way to keep flying will be to keep the nose up. You just pull back on the steering wheel. The yoke, he calls it. To move what he calls the elevators in the tail. You'll lose speed, but keep altitude. It will look like you have a choice, speed or height, but either way you're still going to nose-dive into the ground.
    That's enough, I tell him, I'm not getting what you'd call a pilot's license. I just need to use the toilet like nobody's business. I just want him out that door.
    Then we slow to 175 knots. Not to bore you with the details, but we drop to under 10,000 feet and pull open the forward cabin door. Then the pilot's gone, and even before I shut the cabin door, I stand at the edge of the doorway and take a leak after him.
    Nothing in my life has ever felt that good.
    If Sir Isaac Newton was right, this wouldn't be a problem for the pilot on his way down.
    So now I'm flying west on autopilot at mach 0.83 or 455 miles per hour, true airspeed, and at this speed and latitude the sun is stuck in one place all the time. Time is stopped. I'm flying above the clouds at a cruising altitude of 39,000 feet, over the Pacific Ocean, flying toward disaster, toward Australia, toward the end of my life story, straight line southwest until all four engines flame out.
    Testing, testing. One, two, three.
    One more time, you're listening to the flight recorder of Flight 2039.
    And at this altitude, listen, and at this speed, with the plane empty, the pilot says there are six or maybe seven hours of fuel left.
    So I'll try to make this quick.
    The flight recorder will record my every word in the cockpit. And my story won't get bashed into a zillion bloody shreds and then burned with a thousand tons of burning jet. And after the plane wrecks, people will hunt down the flight recorder. And my story will survive.
    Testing, testing. One, two, three.
    It was just before the pilot jumped, with the cabin door pulled inside and the military ships shadowing us, with the invisible radar tracking us, in the open doorway with the engines shrieking and the air howling past, the pilot stood there in his parachute and yelled, ""So why do you want to die so bad?""
    And I yelled back for him to be sure and listen to the tape.
    ""Then remember,"" he yelled. ""You have only a few hours. And remember,"" he yelled, ""you don't know exactly when the fuel will run out. There's always the chance you could die right in the middle of your life story.""
    And I yelled, So what else is new?
    And, Tell me something I don't know.
    And the pilot jumped. I took a leak, then I pushed the cabin door back into place. In the cockpit, I push the throttle forward and pull the yoke back until we fly high enough. All that's left to do is press the button and the autopilot takes charge. That brings us back to right here.
    So if you're listening to this, the indestructible black box of Flight 2039, you can go look and see where this plane ended its terminal descent and what's left. You'll know I'm not a pilot after you see the mess and the crater. If you're listening to this, you know that I'm dead.
    And I have a few hours to tell my story here.
    So I figure there's maybe a chance I'll get this story right.
    Testing, testing. One, two, three.
    The sky is blue and righteous in every direction. The sun is total and burning and just right there in front. We're on top of the clouds, and this is a beautiful day forever.
    So let's us take it from the top. Let me start at the start.
    Flight 2039, here's what really happened. Take one.
    And.
    Just for the record, how I feel right now is very terrific.
    And.
    I've already wasted ten minutes.
    And.
    Action.","1262324520"

The way the menu is (was?) set up at Bacchanalia is; you have your choice of beef, chicken, duck or pork.  It's an 8 course or 12 course meal.  We opted for the optional cheese cart and 12 courses.  We got there at around 7:30 and we left at midnight-ish.  I don't remember seeing a waiter.  I can only tell you that the foi gras terrine was awesome and the 3 beef dishes were FUCKING GREAT (but my prime rib still trumps it).

It was a decade ago... I said to myself at the time:  ""It's likely I'll never be able to do this kind of thing again in my life, I should go all-in and have an experience of a lifetime"".

Funny thing about that... I don't regret it a bit, but I remember precious little of the meal.  I remember that the service was crazy good... I couldn't even picture a waiter or captain, they were virtually invisible.  I remember a few dishes being outstanding.  Other dishes were unremarkable.

I hope my bitch ex remembers more details than I do.  I'd hate to think that money was fully wasted.  At least I can say that I never missed out on the finer things in life, but the irony will always be that I've had more enjoyment out of a $10 meal than I did out of that one.

For the education, I suppose it was worth the price.  I wouldn't trade it.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","Are Thai Women Romantic 


The question posed is obviously mainly of interest to men who have or are thinking of having a relationship with a Thai Woman. Many Western men dream of having a lovely Thai Lady as their partner. In their imagination visions of an exotic and compliant woman who will attend to their every need may feature prominently.

Thai Women are indeed skilled in looking after the needs of their man and making him feel special. However a man who is primarily interested in this rather selfish and one way type of relationship may be in for an unwelcome surprise.

 Indeed even the Man who's head is screwed on properly may find that his Thai Lady (and her family) are a cash consuming machine that he is unprepared to deal with. The man who has sleepwalked into this type of situation will quickly find that the loving relationship he had hoped for has become a war of attrition with his bank balance the territory being fought over !!

A Thai Women will arrange her marriage primarily along business lines. In choosing a partner she will be guided by the wishes of her Family (mainly her Mother). A fairly significant number of,mainly lower class Thai Families will see the inclusion of a Westerner into their ranks in purely financial terms.

Any man who has been unfortunate enough to Marry into a Family such as the one described above will quickly find that entreaties to his partner to have her Family moderate it's demands for cash help will fall on deaf ears. The closeness of Family bonds in Thailand mean that requests for ever larger amounts of cash by the Family will be diligently pursued by his partner, whose allegiance is not to him but to her kith and kin!!

While to a greater or lesser degree the demands for cash help for the Family will feature in most Thai Western Marriages in the main this can be controlled and kept at a sensible level. Many Western Men pay their partner a monthly salary on the understanding that this money is hers to do with as she pleases. Should she decide to give some, or indeed all of this money too her family this is great, but that there will be no additional cash payments made to the family.

In spite all of the obstacles many Thai Western Marriages survive. Perhaps because of  the old adage that "" love conquers all"" or perhaps because a mutually beneficial business arrangement has been entered into or most likely a subtle merging of the two.

To answer the question posed in the title it should be understood that ideas of romantic love are simply not relevant in Thailand. Instead of posing the question "" does he love you ?"" to her Daughter a Thai Mother will instead ask ""is he kind to you?"" and who is to say that the Thais more practical approach is any less valid than our own.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","This was me in highschool, although I had the benefit of being 6'4"" and being able to hide my weight pretty well (sucking in my stomach, etc) most friends thought I was 220-240, but I was really 270 and got up to 290 once. I blame a lot of it on being really studious, and not caring much about my image, I had been fat my whole life, and didn't think it was worth it to change everything I would have to. Once I got to college, I started dropping weight fast; first, I got one of the more limited meal plans; since I'm not wealthy, once I was out of food for the week, I couldn't really buy extra food or eat out, second, I started swimming, a lot. Our school had a great athletic facility and pool, and I hate sweating like a pig, but I love swimming. I dropped about 60 pounds my first year (a nightmare because I had to get lots of new clothes). I think that the best thing to do is control your diet first; exercise is great but seems to have less of an impact. Im a big numbers guy, so I calculated my basal metabolic rate it was around 3000 calories or so and forced myself to eat 500-1000 fewer calories than that on a daily basis. I kept a spreadsheet with daily calories, hours of various activities and estimated calorie expenditure. At first it was a pain, but once you get into the habit, you really don't want to break a good habit, so it gets easier. I started up swimming once I looked a bit less fat with my shirt off, and now I'm around 200. I'd love to get to 180 or so, but I need to build more muscle, because swimming alone doesn't really do it. The good thing though is my leg muscles are ripped because I spent my entire life carrying around an extra 100 pounds.","1262324955"

Yes and well stated. What isn't fabricated from our minds? Our eyes aren't the things that ""see"" they are just windows for our occipital lobe. Our brain takes upside down, criss crossed light from our eyes and creates the image. If you sit in complete isolation for long enough your brain starts to make up impulses and you begin to hallucinate. The only question is: once you forget it to be a hallucination isn't that your new reality?


This brings us to subjective reality. If ones subjective reality is the only thing that they know to be true then any objective reality is automatically falsified, and that leads to insanity and isolation or the complete opposite.


&gt;In the end, you're going to live your life like it's all real because that's what's practical, if not extremely likely.

Very true. While you couldn't spot me on the street (yet) on a soap box pissing off everyone by telling them they're MY dream I will probably do what most people do, try to make this life the best god damn dream I can.

The only issue is with that is that pretty quickly it'd be impossible for anyone to upvote or downvote anything (at least until they received more karma from new users) and spam control would become an issue.  That, and you'd see a lot more alt accounts (since presumably each new account would come with a certain amount of karma), which would defeat the purpose of having a fixed amount of karma and put a greater strain on Reddit servers.

Perhaps you could tweak it just a bit so that one earned a certain amount of karma per day regardless of activity?

I don't know.  There's really no easy answer here.  The only real solution, perhaps, (and this happens to be a solution to just about every problem humanity faces) is to euthanize the intellectually dishonest, the intellectually impaired, the [excessively] ignorant, sociopaths, the belligerent, the myopic, and those who have a difficult time controlling their greedy impulses.

You also assert that these batteries are environmentally devastating.  On the contrary, lithium-ion batteries are classified as non-hazardous waste because they do not have any toxic metals.  They are therefore safe for incinerators and land fills.

Another point- is that home power consumption needs have been increasing.  Rather than increasing the load capacity of a centralized grid, why not subsidize decentralized power and have all the benefits from it?

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The part you snipped out was sort of important, there.  It's not clear from the context of his quote whether or not he personally believes Jews should be in Israel because God promised it to them (and actually, it doesn't matter) -- what he's doing is he's rebuting common arguments.

As I see it, the context of the quote most likely concerns strategy vis-a-vis the Palestinians, and in particular the question of whether or not the Palestinian population can be pacified.  Ben Gurion is pointing out that the arguments *for* Israel which may resonate with Jews, which include historicity (i.e., we Jews used to live here many millenia ago) and religion (i.e., God designated this place for us) are irrelevant to Palestinians and cannot be used to sway them in favor of voluntarily giving up their land.

If anything, I found this quote surprising because it seems as though Ben Gurion is on some level actually *empathizing* with the Palestinan cause -- something I would never have thought possible for him -- by saying, ""Look, I don't blame them for fighting us, and if I were one of them I would too.""

The last part of your quote, ""So it's simple: we have to stay strong and maintain a powerful army,"" to me comes from that position: he's deduced (correctly, it seems) that because the Palestinians will not leave and neither will the Israelis, conflict is inevitable, and must be prepared for.

If anything, this shrewd position gave Israel the strategic upper-hand.  Zionists had been immigrating to Palestine since the end of the 19th century, and with a few isolated exceptions had been mostly welcomed by the resident Palestinian population.  Had the Palestinians shared Ben Gurion's analysis -- it will come down to us or them, and so we must be prepared to fight -- they might have been better prepared when the Nakba rolled around.

Unfortunately for them, they didn't start fighting back until the first intifada.  By then Israel was well established.","1262325324"

I hope you didn't think this would be some wonderful unburdening that would end with a massive circle-jerk of praise for your noble transformation. You are still a bully. You've just shifted responsibility for your actions to others, while you pander for sympathy as a victim.   

&gt;I grew up seeing the world in terms of fear, domination, and violence. As a child there was literally no person who could be trusted and no place that was completely safe.

Stop trying to justify unjustifiable behavior. Admit that you chose to perpetrate violence against the weak and defenseless without any justification, whatsoever.

&gt;I'll forward that right along with mine over to my dad. Actually, skip him and go to HIS dad, who whipped him with a belt all the time, or to my mom's mom, who molested her and all her siblings, or to her dad, who watched it happen and didn't do anything about it.

If you let yourself off the hook, you let daddy off the hook, and you let daddy's daddy off the hook, etc.

Fuck your mitigating circumstances. Take responsibilty.

Are you going to teach your child that violence against the weak and defenseless is wrong UNLESS they don't happen to live up to an abritrary standard of ""macho""? Are you going to teach your child that he should never beat his wife UNLESS he's had a particularly stressful day?  

Every moment you spend avoiding this responsibility, you honor the monstrous behavior of your forebears and tacitly agree to follow their example.

""Civil disobedience becomes a sacred duty when the state has become lawless or corrupt. And a citizen who barters with such a state shares in its corruption and lawlessness...Every citizen is responsible for every act of his government...There is only one sovereign remedy, namely, non-violent non-cooperation.  Whether we advertise the fact or not, the moment we cease to support the government it dies a nature death....My method is conversion, not coercion, it is self-suffering, not the suffering of the tyrant....I hope the real Swaraj (self-rule) will come not by the acquisition of authority by the few but by the acquisition by all of the courage to resist authority when abused.  In other words, Swaraj is to be attained by education the masses to a sense of their capacity to regulate ad control authority.... Civil disobedience is the assertion of a right which law should give but which it denies...Civil disobedience presupposes willing obedience of our self-imposed rules, and without it civil disobedience would be cruel joke....Civil disobedience means capacity for unlimited suffering without the intoxicating excitement of killing....Disobedience to be civil has to be open and nonviolent....Disobedience to be civil implies discipline, thought, care, attention...Disobedience that is wholly civil should never provoke retaliation....Non-cooperation and civil disobedience are different but [are] branches of the same tree call Satyagraha (truth-force).... Coercion cannot but result in chaos in the end....One who uses coercion is guilty of deliberate violence. Coercion is inhuman....Non-cooperation with evil is as much a duty as cooperation with good... Nonviolent action without the cooperation of the heart and the head cannot produce the intended result....All through history the way of truth and love has always won.  There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall, always"". Ghandi","1262325584"

Rush didn't further the course of honest debate in this country- he hurt it by using lies to manipulate people, when logic and reason and truth were inconveniently supporting the opposing viewpoint.

Rush was bad for the country.  He was a selfish and dishonest man at best, and an evil man at worst.

For a suburban company you either sit at headquarters and await a call (no transfers) or you can go drive around until a call comes in.  When you get to work you need to do rig inspections, driver checks, and resupply checks.

I see that people have gone into your overview and down voted you as well.  But considering the group with whom you are dealing, that is to be expected.

Kudos to you for actually stepping into the arena and taking a stand in this particular situation.  The action you've taken in this case is appropriate and refreshing in its display of not only having, but actually practicing, a sense of decency.","1262325915"

If you find yourself cooking super intricate meals that take forever, try to tone them down a bit.  Make some spaghetti, taco salad or chili.  Cut corners where you can.

Another possibility is to teach the kid to cook.  I was cooking as early as 12, and honestly most meals were pretty easy.  I had no problem cooking up some pasta for my parents if I had nothing better to do, as long as I didn't have to do it every night.","1262325945"

Why? Because SETI has other benefits. First, it's a good advertisement for science. We need to be able to get more people interested in science, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is something that catches the imagination.
Second, SETI is making other valuable discoveries as it carries out its search. SETI has found anomalies in the data, that, when examined and explained, led to a deeper understanding of our cosmos.

Since Hawking radiation consists of many particles, including antimatter particles, if A is made of matter it will be destroyed by the Hawking radiation.

To the outside observer, as the object approaches the black hole the light from it will rapidly redshift to nothing.  I'm not really sure how accelerations appear to an outside observer in relativistic spacetime, but I was assume that experimentally, at the very least, the light from it would be so redshifted that instruments wouldn't be able to detect it some distance from the event horizon.","1262326018"

"Health","t5_2qh9z","I may have messed up the text thing, but here it is again:

This case is already in medical hands as it is. I am not a doctor, just a friend helping to look for any straw to grasp. This is not a call for medical advice per se. However due to the quantity of unknowns and my personal desire to do SOMETHING to try and help, I am looking for anyone that might have some insight or may have come across a similar case. At the very least, having new questions to ask the doctors or new questions for the doctors themselves to ask would be at least something. If anything, I just want to see if the internet (which is largely global) might have a lead. I'm already approaching this as a dead end not to be pessimistic, but because I understand the severity of her condition and that optimism can be just as harsh to the parents.

Facts, as best as I can present them, because this is the important part:
Adopted 2yo female, about 17 pounds.
Diagnosed with Russel-Silver Syndrome.
Diagnosed with Mitochondreal disease (the severity and where it affects are unknown).
Suffers from Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (origin unknown).

Tests have been done... EKGs, MRIs, Barium swallow test, gastric empting study, and ultrasounds. None of which show anything physically wrong. Apparently the main problem is that there is a duplicate copy of Chromosome#7.

She is on medications for energy regulation for her mitochondrial condition, to reduce stomach acid, anti seziure meds to try and control her cyclic vomiting episodes, and appetite enhancers. 

She alternates from being fine (the longest stretch has been about three weeks) to being sick for up to or around a week. And unfortunately: rinse and repeat =(

From what the parents told me, there may still be a surgical option or an injection to help regulate her functions, but at the moment, it's up in the air.

If there is any other information about this case that might help, I can try and get it. Her parents are the type of people you like to have in this world... honest-to-goodness nice people. It hurts to see not only their child suffer, but to see them in pain as well. It's weird to say it, but I kind of wish there was a god... just to have someone to blame... someone to yell at... I even get kind of shaky when I think about the girl and I apologize if it seems like I am trying to tug on heartstrings. I don't need sympathy, just any information that might lead to help.

Again, I expect very little to come of this, but it just feels wrong not to try. =(

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","There is a bully, just like you, who targeted me in middle school. He ran up and punched me in the face as hard as he could. He terrorized me in the locker room. He pressed a knife in the back on my neck in English class, pushing just hard enough to cause great pain but not enough to puncture the skin. I lived in terror, but - and this mattered far more to me - humiliation. He made me feel worthless.

So, first of all, fuck you and I hope you die a horrible death for what you did to kids. You're a worthless excuse for a life form and if you'll give me the opportunity i'd be happy to choke you to death on my enormous cock. Or my baseball bat. I don't care about which weapon.

Second, I see my tormentor on Facebook (a friend of a friend) and I know enough to find him. I can easily do what the world would rightly forgive me for, setting him up and dispatching the stain of a feeble being that should never have been born to begin with. I would actually enjoy watching him twist and scream in pain as he begged for mercy and I would do nothing to help him. I would set him on fire myself. I would extinguish him just before he died only to torment him further, have him beg for his life, and then set him alight again. Hell, it's possible I'd jerk off into his flaming corpse.

So, come to Reddit, you soulless piece of shit, and look to be understood all you want.  I'd rather demonstrate why the state gives guys like me a conceal carry permit than listen to a fucking word that comes out of your pointless face.

**tl;dr:** Fuck you, bully. Die.

Overall - the click wheel was genius as a whole, especially in the early Gen1-3 days, and started to get long in the tooth as the iPod ""classic"" lost it's spot as the king ipod and the Touch came around. The Touch is Apple's current solution for navigating such a vast list..

The Agent 18 Polycarb cases seemed to have fit around it just fine. 

&gt;G5.5 version added alphabetical searching, but they never backported that to the G5.0 device - because Apple are bastards and never add features to old hardware.

That is possibly the stupidest thing to escape your mouth. 

There were so many updates to my iPhone is is amazing. Updates to my shuffle and iPods brought new features and menus and occasionally better battery performance.  My gen 1 iPhone on it's second owner is currently running OS 3.0.  almost 95% of iPhone owners are currently running 3.0 - most of which did not ship with it. 

The OS version that brought that feature to iPods was made for the faster 5.5 iPods that came out over a year later (different CPU, I believe). putting the newer software on an older unit would have made your device even slower. Zunes have always had the same level of hardware - so there was no barrier to them upgrading their OS. The iPod touch and iPhones are all basically the same Hardware revisions as well - whereas every iPod was a different embedded OS on a different chip. the iPods were not thought of as a platform until the Gen5's sold in unbelievable quantity - and by then Apple saw the writing on the wall and started work on the iPhone/iPod Touch (Started in ~2005, around the time the 5th Gens were released). 

But here will be a day when an OS update for the faster iPhone 3GS or above only - and I welcome that day -that's progress.

It's possible for inflation to help the rich and deflation to help the poor and middle-class--but hardly possible for everyone to benefit.

Most importantly: can a central bank, which is controlled by people with vested interests such as politicians and corporations, actually implement policy that is beneficial to society?  It's a well known fact that the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates in accordance with election cycles -- this policy effects everyone in the country and many people in the world, but has nothing to do with economic fundamentals.  The actual implementation of monetary policy and how it effects societies is something that the Austrian economist von Hayek wrote extensively about and won a Nobel Prize for.","1262326309"

You may have interpreted my grievance the wrong way. In most other aspects, they advocate elimination of the federal government in the private lives of citizens, however, in the subject of pornography they wish to call upon the federal government to regulate or criminalize it.

Personally, if you want the federal government to do more than:

* secure national borders
* provide a unitary body for which states to come together and defend against foreign threats
* mediate interstate disputes

I do not consider this Constitutionalism. If the federal government infringes on any aspect of individual liberty, it is unconstitutional. I have no issue with the states or local governments having these powers since this is how it was designed.","1262326350"

However, your best bet is to go to your local bike shop and see what they have. Any decent shop should guide you in the right direction.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","That there are religious Muslims who advocate Palestinian control of Jerusalem for religious reasons -- who believe that it must be controlled by a Muslim state -- is not in question.  It's also not the point being made...

The point here is that religion aside, the Palestinians themselves -- not Muslims in general, but the Arabs and other non-Jewish minorities who have lived in the Levant historically since antiquity -- are not motivated in their opposition to Israeli control of Jerusalem by their religious faith, but rather because the Israelis are pushing them out of neighborhoods (particularly in East Jerusalem) that their families have resided in for hundreds if not thousands of years.

It's not ""we want Jerusalem because the Dome of the Rock is there,"" it's ""we want Jerusalem because we've always lived here and why should we leave?""

Sure, some random fanatic in Saudi Arabia or Iran or something may feel that only a Muslim nation has the right to control Jerusalem and it may as well be the Palestinians, but those people's opinions don't come into play.

Palestinians want Jerusalem -- and all of Palestine, really -- because it's their home, and has been for a long time.

That's right, prices drop.  Dramatically.

What happens when this inevitability finally happens (despite everyone's best attempts to delay or prevent)?  All those little secret holding companies the FedTreasury spun up over the last year and a half bite the big one.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Although it's a WWI story, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is an example of a book and two movies told from the German perspective, to American audiences, where the characters are sympathetic. 

It's important to recognize that war movies are action movies, and when the politics is removed, audiences can concentrate on the action. I don't think Americans ever saw the German military as particularly evil in its own right. They fought for an evil political leadership, but as an army, as soldiers, they were the ""bad guys"", in American movies at least, but not *that* bad. 

There's a world of difference between the German and Japanese soldier in terms of American sentiment. In wartime propaganda, we were fighting *Hitler* and *Naziism* across the Atlantic, but we were fighting the *Jap* -- the whole race, on the other. 

My grandmother, who lost her only son in Normandy, used to say ""At least he was killed by the Germans, and not the Japanese"". 

When I was a kid, all our dads were WWII vets. We used to play army, and either used to be German or American. We didn't really care which side to play, 'cause the Germans had neat tanks and airplanes -- the stuff of war movies. Germany was just the other side in a football game of army vs. army. 

I think mostly, Americans have been able to separate the German army from the Nazi party. I had a friend, now passed away, who was an American POW in Germany, and while he says he hates Germany, when you go for the details, he says he was never actually mistreated as a prisoner, saying only that they were very, very hungry, ""but the Germans didn't have anything to eat, either"".

This identification is based on the Turkish definition of Mewat, so-called “dead”, unreclaimed land. It constituted about 50 to 60% of the land in Palestine. Private individuals could purchase and register this land as their own for its unreclaimed value, but since that implied paying taxes on it, it was just as easy to simply cultivate it. If the land had been cultivated with permission, it would be registered, at least under the Mandate, free of charge, for as long as it was cultivated and for three years after then. Then it reverted to the state. 

Mewat land was defined as any land that was more than a mile and a half from a village, and was not owned by anyone. However, no systematic survey was ever done, so it was impossible to determine the precise extent of Mewat land.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","Well, yeah the standard R ""GUI"" (that you get running rgui.exe if you're on a windows machine) is basically a command line interface with a graphics window.

But the way R is designed, that's kind of how it ought best to be used; by the time you're done mousing through a bunch of menu items and clicking in check boxes and putting in information through a typical interface, you've already finished it in R, generalied the problem and written a function that will do it for you in the future.

There are several more WIMP-like interfaces available for R in the download packages, *and* you can call R functions from within a variety of other things (even Excel, if you're so inclined), but I think R's main value comes from actually wrestling with R's particular way of doing things in the command-line and getting the value that comes with that. It requires a greater investment of effort up front, but it quickly starts to pay that back.

There's a huge user community, a ton of resources, and people willing to answer questions, and the standard install is a doddle to set up. I carry R on a USB stick, so I'm never without a decent stats package now.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The ""projecting into a high dimensional space"" part is interesting to mathematicians and people that know about reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, but I don't think someone will walk away with understanding what you're doing on an algorithmic level.

I've explained this to a few people before and what made the most sense to them was actually writing out that what we're doing is we're defining a function
    g : X →  R
where X is the dataspace and R is the real numbers such that g(x) is big for positive examples and g(x) is closer to negative infinity for negative examples. 

The way we construct g is by taking a weighted sum of some basic functions
    f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., f_n(x)
which are defined in terms of the data, i.e. each f_i = f(x,x_i) where x_i is a datapoint and we have
    g(x) = a_1*f_1(x) + a_2*f_2(x) + ... + a_n*f_n(x)
where
    a_1, a_2, ..., a_n
are real numbers.   Then I say that the game is to choose those a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (real numbers too) such that we can get g(x) to behave as we want, so the functions are defined using the datapoints and then the weight parameters are chosen using an optimization procedure.

The advantage of this presentation is that its easy to connect to using sigmoid functions (which aren't kernels) but are commonly used in practice.","1262326685"

Phew.  Let's get into it.

&gt;He could have died in any number of ways, including not dying at all, as long as what he did fulfilled a prophesy?

Thought I covered this already.  He died to save us, not *merely* to fulfill prophecy.  He chose to die in the most demeaning and torturous way that is state-sanctioned.  

&gt;There was no actual need for him to die.

To understand why you're incorrect here, you'd have to understand the Torah.  It's going to be hard to relate, briefly, the nature of sacrifices in the Bible.  But the idea was that if you sinned, you could lay your sin on an animal, and sacrifice that animal to God, to clear you of sin.

The only possible perfect, eternal, one-for-all sacrifice is God Incarnate.

&gt;prophesies and messiahs

You're pretty much asking here for a thorough education in Jewish and Christian religion.  I've spent decades learning this stuff, and while I have a hold on the crux of it, there are still things I learn today.  If you seek, though, you'll find.  

Messiah means anointed one.  Prophets were sent to tell Israel that the Messiah (capital M, there were many messiahs with a lowercase m, like Samson, David, etc) was coming, and how he would come, and what he would do.  The Prophets were sent to tell Israel this so they would know who it was when he came.  

So much for that, eh?

&gt;but the fact remains that it wasn't necessary at all. 

That's not a fact, that's your opinion.  And on what is it based?  Do you know better than God?

&gt;God will never, ever mess with any person's free will

Eh, not true.  He can, and does.  See Pharoah.  He usually allows us to control our actions, but sometimes he steps in.  

&gt;For me to believe what you believe...

I'm not going to prove anything.  But if you want proof, seek it with all humility and you'll find it.

&gt;Of course you're not amazed. 

I didn't know or had forgotten you were an Atheist.  Even as such, I assumed by the claims you were making you were at least familiar with the subject matter.  And, being familiar with the subject matter and saying the things you were saying...didn't add up.  It's what I get for assuming.

&gt;Heck, it isn't even enough for you. 

Through religious experience I know that God Is.  I know what he wants from me.  By these things I can come to understand many other things (validity of the Bible, transubstantiation, etc).  Not with as much certainty as I know God is, but with enough to put my strong faith on it.

&gt;A person could rob me, assault me, rape me or do something even worse, and as long as he is a faithful Christian, he will be forgiven. What about me?

If he's a faithful Christian he won't do these things.  If, afterwards, later, he becomes a Christian, he will seek to make reparations.

&gt;It's like me saying the color green is completely red.

Praise Christ, who turns water to wine, and wine to the blood of God Incarnate.  All things are possible with God.

&gt;You have no way of knowing that.

And what do you know?  What on earth do you claim to *know*?

13. A common and enjoyable sexual practice for a man is to take his half-erect penis and slap it repeatedly on a woman's butt.

16. Double penetration makes women smile.
17. Asian men don't exist.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think the problem, in your scenario of a cop uncovering evidence illegally, is that if the cop broke the rules to get the evidence, the evidence could now be tainted, or falsified.  Also it becomes a slippery slope in that why wouldn't a cop just break all rules to get evidence, and if all cops work together to protect each other to collect evidence, then it would be difficult for them to be caught.  You then have a corrupt police force and justice system, which is one of the stronger institutions that the US does have.  ","1262326843"

I've seen Bob twice, and he can do some pretty impressive actual (as in, real bullet) shooting but he doesn't do the two balloons in the sound of one shot.

Couple that with medical issues that pretty much made any social engagements impossible, a month off of my final year of high school (due to the medical thing) and moving away to university and you get where I am now. I get the feeling I'm not wanted around when I'm with my ""friends"". I can't drink (same medical reason), which is pretty much all they do anyway, not that that would really stop me from being able to go party or whatever. If I'm annoying, I don't know why, and therefore can't fix it. I'm always the one inviting people over, and when they do come they don't seem too thrilled and they never invite me out with them.

I want to make friends and be social, but I guess I'm not very good at it.

Also, the thing that scares me the most is that I'll be moving again this weekend to start my co-op job. Thing is, I'll be living alone, there's nothing to do where I'm going, and I don't know anyone there.

Additionally, by some interpretations, we are not 'The People'. We are 'citizens' which, IIRC, is a title of office constructed in a later amendment which carries with it different responsibilities and limitations.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Under ""God"" represents this will be done for the good and wellness of mankind . . .

 . . as  long as you believe in the Judeo-Christian God. Everybody else is marginalized.

&gt;The republic is pretty much the model of governance in North America. The U.S founding fathers not only drafted a masterpiece for the USA but for the entire world (if they choose to follow). Many governments in the 'free world' are modeled after this blueprint in some shape form or fashion.

Actually, our nation was not the model for the ""free world""--Rome was. The form of government our Founding Fathers chose was a more modern adaptation of the Roman triumvirate. 

&gt;There is no competition to be ""better"" than anyone else's pledge or oath.

Then what is the point of reciting a pledge? What are we pledging our allegiance to? A pledge is something I take seriously. Why would we insist that children across the country recite this in class if you can't nail down what exactly is *written in the pledge* that expresses our most important ideals?

&gt;When the US founding fathers broke away from the King, and drafted the constitution, they were in a very dark age, and wanted to ensure would never happen again. You are seriously lacking history.

Remind me again: which of our Founding Fathers ever recited the Pledge?  And I hate to be repetitive, but what exactly is written into the pledge that expresses those ideas you're referring to?

&gt;anyway the point is.. to make a pledge to be ""United"" for ""Liberty"" means you are one huge entity to ensure Freedom prevails.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The reason for the appeasment was to buy time to arm. The reason Germany ran over France so quickly was because they didn't arm properly. Instead of listening to Colonel DeGaulle, who insisted France needed mobile armor, they went ahead and built the Maginot line -- which the Germans simply went around. 

Contrary to what one might expect, Chamberlain's career ended with him being a highly respected elder statesman -- because the MP's understood the strategy and necessity of appeasement. 

Saying the French are cowards, betrays a huge ignorance of history, not to mention a freshly laundered brain. And a lack of gratitude for the lives they gave -- more than any other Allied nation, if not more than all others combined. Not to mention the fact that without France's help, America never would have been born in the first place.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;For a western world atheist to live in fear of being ""lynched"" today is a tad hysterical

I think Dyolf_Knip was referring to the fact that if no one was there to keep Christians from infringing on people's rights we may run the risk of apathetic atheists being lynched for not believing.  Alluding to the Christian Dark ages where Christians had full control, and used that power to commit horrible atrocities certainly does apply.

&gt;in the very same manner that American Christians are mildly hysterical in talking of how they are persecuted.

I don't think the two are remotely similar as it's hard to be persecuted when you're the vast majority.  If I stop someone from hitting someone with a bat, I'm not persecuting the attacker, I'm protecting the rights of the victim.  Some people tend not to understand this point however, thus the persecution complex.

&gt;I was pointing out, again, the similarity between hysterical atheists and hysterical Christians.

The two are completely different.  Stalin could have believed in an Ice Cream sandwich deity for all it mattered.  They committed crimes and happened to be atheists, whereas Christians did the crimes solely because they were Christian.  If the Christians didn't believe in their gospel, the torture simply wouldn't have been done.

&gt;For an atheist to say ""it could happen here"" because of something that happened in the dark ages is akin to a wild-eyed christian saying ""it could happen here"" with reference to Stalin and Mao.

It's not analogous at all.  If someone who didn't believe in Santa Claus killed someone, and someone believed that Santa TOLD THEM to murder someone and they did, the situations are greatly different.  One is a coincidence and the other is a direct cause.

&gt;Thus, in conclusion, if you believe that, as an atheist, you have a ""serious"" reason for fearing being lynched in front of a church because of something that happened some 800 years ago -- in the dark ages -- then it would be hard to see, logically speaking, how one could deny hysterical christians their ""serious"" fear of the secularist boogeymen taking over and murdering them etctera.

I don't think anyone in this thread said they were actively worried about being lynched by Christians.  With the exception of perhaps coloured people in the American South, it's probably a rare occurrence.  However we have SEEN what happens when Christians wield complete power without an enforceable constitution and bill of rights to protect minorities.  This is what Dyolf_Knip was alluding to.","1262327056"

This is an incredibly ignorant or poorly worded statement, one which should be clarified or simply cut by the journalist.

Do ""ordinary folks"" (i.e. non-criminals) acquire and carry handguns for use in crime? No. Do criminals acquire their guns through licensed dealers (i.e. straw purchases) in their locality? [Not necessarily](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/21/cbsnews_investigates/main2833664.shtml).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","And this is the kind of moronic reasoning that further fuels this. Wonder why the Arab world cared very little or none at all about the West before World War 1? Because World War 1 resulted in the West colonizing them. Then World War 2 saw the fall of direct colonialism but not the fall of economic colonialism. It is poverty and lack of education that makes people like this susceptible to desperation. For instance, one of the captured Mumbai terrorists shocked Indian police at his readiness to fight for India if they would give his family enough money to eat.* Not only this but if one were to ask any common Arab on the street why they dislike the US, it is because of Israel. These uneducated Arabs do not understand that their own leaders and their own economic institutions are being used against them; that is too far above their heads, but all of them know of Israel and the plight of the Palestinians. So you have under educated young men poor and whose family are starving approached by men who tell them to come to their aid of their brothers in Palestine and if they do so, their families will be paid a nice sum.

But no. Let's ignore the actual reasons and instead focus on an issue that has nothing to do with the problem. It's like saying my brother is sick because he ate bad meat, so let's shave his head-- that'll fix everything even though he's eating that meat again.

Recently, I finally got around to reading the famous *Guns of August* by Barbara Tuchman. I had it in my to-read pile for years, since I'd always heard it was one of the great books of history.

By the time I finished it, I felt ""OMG I must read every book this woman has ever written, right now!"" Fortunately, I already had another one of hers, *Bible and Sword*, at home, so I moved right on to that, buying me some time until I could go to the bookstore. I went to the bookstore a few days later, bought all 3 other books of hers thay had in stock, and ordered 2 others. Maybe by the time I read 7 in a row I'll be satisfied and can pick up the books I stopped in the middle of when I got sucked into Guns of August :)

In the past I've always preferred books about the world written by journalists rather than most historians, because a lot of historians view their job as digging out all the facts (which, to be fair, it is) while journalists understand that they're telling a story - so books by historians, a lot of the time, just lay out the facts, while journalists tie them together in ways that actually spark mental connections and help me learn.

Barbara Tuchman is not most historians. She can dig out the facts, and *she can write* like the best novelists. Her history books are literature.

Bible and Sword is about the relationship between England and Israel/Palestine, from the earliest history until Allenby entered Jerusalem in 1918. Her thesis is that this relationship has run in two parallel threads: one of practical politics, commerce, and war (Sword) and the other of story, myth, and religion (Bible).

When I'm done with it, I'm going to read *The Zimmerman Telegram* next. I'm excited, it looks like an exciting political spy thriller novella. (about real world events, of course, but reading Tuchman feels like reading fiction too)

Regular_Dude's problem is that even though he is paying this insurance company, they refuse to cover his wife's procedure. If there had been complications during the surgery (which seems likely, based on her history), the price would have skyrocketed. If they had not decided to have another baby, he would have paid for that out of pocket, and it would have been like paying double. He would have still had to pay his monthly insurance bill in addition to however much his wife's surgery ended up costing. That is why he is blaming the insurance company--because they are refusing to provide the service he is paying them to provide.","1262327247"

Even to men pre-internet.

In my youth, maybe 5th grade, we spent hundreds of hours canvassing the road ditches because some guys in our grade had found porn there (Later as a surveyor, I could indeed say that roadsides seem to be a porn ditching place).

A tradition in my high school was for seniors to tear up porn mags and leave pages on windshields when they graduated.  Some of these inevitably blew into the elementary school recess yard.  Every single year this happened, and every single year every boy from 4th grade on knew when, and we all hoped the wind blew our way.  Some years it did, and we hoarded pages and pages of porn for years.  Some years it didn't, and we scavenged it from the ditch.

The point is, porn has always been around, at least as long as cameras have.  And males have always found it.","1262327253"

First, I'm African American.  Last night, my girlfriend, who's asian-american, asked me if I knew about African-African slavery and she was shocked that I did; she'd never knew it before.  I'd always thought it was a fairly well-known fact at this point.  

When she asked me what I thought of it, all I could say was that I still don't think it was the same as what the Europeans turned it into, in general.  First of all, everyone was doing it.  It was a horrible institution but there doesn't seem to be a nation on this Earth that wasn't complicit in it.  So if that's the case, all you can do is judge how slaves were treated.  Since Africa isn't a country, all the nations seemed to treat their slaves differently...in some cases it was pretty brutal, and in others it was so liberal that slaves became kings.

So...I dunno, what do you guys think?  To me, it's kind of a null question.  My opinion is that the trans-atlantic slave trade turned something that used to be a consequence of war into a reason to *go* to war for many African nations.  Tough issue and I wish it was one that the American educational system didn't just skip over.","1262327258"

That would be the law specifically for the Israelites, who were brand new in a brand new land surrounded by people who wish nothing but to destroy them.  Whether they attack from the outside in or in the case of false prophets, from the inside out, they will remain targets of constant attacks for the entire time they were in that land.  (We know by reading the rest of the OT that they were their own undoing by worshiping other gods and outright disobedience to God.)

Now, obviously, do we Christians practice the same laws?  Yes and no.  Yes that we do not tolerate those coming in trying to deceive a congregation and preach a false gospel.  These false prophets have come only to destroy and scatter the congregation and must be taken seriously.  We are to not only reject their false teachings, but we remove them from the premises where they are not allow to return.  Not only will there be ""wolves"" attacking from the outside in but there will be ""wolves in sheep's clothing"" attacking from inside out.  These are people who attend church and gain the trust of a group within the church in order to cause dissension among the rest of the congregation.  These wolves, two, are excommunicated from the church, never to return.

Not only do we remove them, but it is our duty to contact other local churches and give them a heads up of what is going on.

We certain will not kill false prophets/teachers/shepherds.  Doing so would be illegal.  Killing them, even it was legal, would indicate that we are judge of their souls where we have been told we are not to judge those who are unbelievers for judgment falls upon our Lord.  It is very clear in Revelation 20 that the Lord will judge then, not now.

People are bad, it's just how it goes. Some are addicted to porn, others to alcohol, others to violence, others to themselves. Doing away with potentially harmful things is not the way to fix society.

I'm no expert, but we should try to find a way to have a positive outlet for these people. However, currently, I'd rather have someone addicted to porn or watching child porn than running out and raping someone.

Then there is spoken Czech, which is what you would use in polite conversation. Then there is colloquial Czech, which you would use in informal conversations. There is, of course, also ""street slang"" which is mostly restricted to kids.

Then there are also regional differences. The Prague version of Czech does have an accent which some people like and some do not. It sounds a little bit like ""singing"" in that some words are held longer than in other areas of the country.

In terms of what Czech you learn in courses, there are plenty of books and tapes for learning Czech and most cover a mix of the formal literary and spoken variants, and usually have a small section introducing the colloquial.","1262327545"

Study places where many people converge, or people get their resources and how they can be disrupted. For example, if many people get their water from a central source, you want to have a process to stop it if it's contaminated in any way: not just by terrorist attack.

I'm sorry for your retardation. It must be from the lack of oxygen since you're on such a high horse.

While you're waxing poetic about iPhone updates (I too have received updates for mine) - you forget that Apple had the gall to *charge* iPod Touch owners. They're ""customer-friendly"" only in the sense of ""raping them.""

&gt; putting the newer software on an older unit would have made your device even slower.

And that's the stupidest thing that I've heard *you* say yet, since in the next paragraph you praise the virtues of running the v3.0 firmware on your Gen 1 iPhone.

The iPod video can play video and games - it makes absolutely no sense for you to make excuses about the device being ""made slower"" when it's merely an alphabetical text search. Backporting a search feature to similar hardware shouldn't have been hard, unless their engineers are stupid - or were told not to by marketing (the more likely event.)

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I met several longterm boyfriends on that site, as well as my current beau. I consider myself fairly picky for one thing, and these relationships were all very strong while they lasted and ended on good/reasonable terms. From OKC I have met long-lasting friends and have had among relationships one that lasted two years, one for a single year, one for six months and also various dates that didn't go anywhere.

The more you feed into it, especially the matching algorithm, and the more thought-provoking and insightful your profile, the better luck you will have. The algorithm is surprisingly worth your term and produces rather solid results.

As a girl on OKC, I look for well-written profiles that display a person's thoughts and feelings, which I find attractive as a sapiosexual, and actually am not as shallow as people suggest us women folk to be. I am on the site primarily because I live far away from my main urban center (I commute and hour to college) and end up being a bit of a hermit when I am not hanging out with my small group of friends. Its not because I am a crazy desperate nut job, if that gives you any hope, though I have actually had people look down on me for using dating sites.","1262327790"

No one 2010 years ago referred to this as year one.  They (the people in the culture that our modern calendar is based on) would have referred to it as the 27th year of the reign of Augustus, I think.  But that doesn't matter.  The numbering of the years has to start *somewhere*, and they started (over 5 centuries after the fact) it at year one, with that year being the year they assumed Jesus died.  It's arbitrary, but it's a point of reference.

Also, it doesn't start on Christmas because they kept the Roman monthly calendar, although the feast of Christmas was already established.  

I don't pretend to know what they were thinking, and it doesn't make much sense, but, arbitrary as it is,  it is the established method we still use.","1262327798"

TLDR - I recommend marriage counseling.  

Long Version:  I've had it and it helped a lot.  It isn't magic or cheap but it may give you and your husband some tools to help communicate and figure this out.  I was not an advocate for marriage counseling until my wife bothered and harrassed me into going.  I had a very poor view of the process when it began but when I learned I could do some simple and easy things to make my wife much happier... I was glad that I had gone.  If he cares enough about you to save the marriage your husband will go with you when you request this.  M.C. will teach you some helpful communication skills that will ease tensions in the relationship and hopefully make your marriage happier for both of you.  A possibly  scenario is that he will learn some simple ways that he can show you he cares and he will change some of his habits to accommodate you and make you happier.  Anyhow, this is how it worked out for my wife and myself.  She and I are both a lot happier.  Now when folks I care about are having problems I don't hesitate to recommend a little counseling.  It really IS very helpful.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; Does that, as written, support independent ownership for those not part of a 'well regulated militia'?

The people of the states **were/are** the militia, hence adding or leaving the subject changes nothing. States did not have their own voluntary military organizations, every citizen was a conscripted member of their respective state's militia. The term regulated refers to meaning organized and equipped; to be ready for action. I believe in Virginia, there is an old law that is still active that states something along of the lines of *in a time of crisis, every able body male of age is automatically conscripted into the Virginia militia*. Several key members who assisted in drafting the Bill of Rights have elaborated greatly in this area, I would recommend giving the Anti federalist and Federalist Papers a good read.  Read it carefully:

*A well regulated Militia* (being the people of the states), *being **necessary** to the security of a free State* (the states were practically considered their own independent nations. The federal government was never supposed to have superior power. However you want to put it the State stands for the sovereign ground that citizens live on), *the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.*

&gt; arms - weapons, esp. firearms.

This is the dictionary definition of arms. Written as it was, arms referred to anything the militia (the people) can get their hands on to fight against the tyranny of an unconstitutional government. Whether it be rakes, axes, torches, black powder rifles, cannons or pistols, tasers or the severed leg of their dog. Arms refers to a weapon. You are welcome to go a step further and acquire the definition of a weapon. I guarantee you, however, that it reads nothing about excluding semi-automatic rifles, pepper spray or a cucumber. It is not specific as to what types of weapons, therefore without ratifying change to the amendment, one cannot assume that there were specifics in mind.

&gt; No matter what, to make such a black and white assertion as ""My way is superior because I agree with my interpretation of what these guys said/trying to say""

This pisses me off because you took a joke and made it serious. I never once mentioned the word superior. I also never said the Constitution was perfect. If I recall, I said that there are vague areas of the Constitution, but the second amendment is **incredibly** specific. I realize people have tried to break it down and interpret it in other fashions, but frankly, I don't see what there is to interpret if you look at semantic evidence as I've laid it out before you. In terms of the second amendment, it **is** black and white, right on the document; well.. rather a faded yellow color. It is rather old.

As I said, to make any changes to adjust for modernization, a ratification of written changes needs to be made.","1262327841"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I believe they would go (then again - this is just a guess!) with total anonymity for anyone that calls to report something.

I have a friend that works with CPS, and in Tx, the standard is...  if it isn't an emergency situation, they will go to the school and interview the child, they will interview the teachers, and then they will interview the parents.  If they feel that the child is in immediate physical danger, they will pull the child immediately.  If not, then they do everything they can to work with the parents...  to help create a safer situation for the child.

If there is a situation where they feel it is an emergency, the police will go out immediately (because sometimes a caseworker can't show up *right now*), and if they get someplace where a child is being physically abused badly enough that it is in immediate danger, the police will take the child, and I have never asked where they go from there.  But if they get to a home, and say...  it is just a matter of no running water, or no food...  they might relocate the family (or just tell the family that they need to get to where there is running/hot water) or contact something like a food bank to get assistance to the family immediately.

CPS really isn't an evil entity that wants to steal everyone's children.  In fact, they try to place the children they feel are in danger into the homes of relatives first.  Their job is to try to remove children from situations of immediate danger, and to educate parents that need that kind of help.  Usually they have heavy case loads, which are often complicated and increased by people who will make these calls as a means of vengeance against each other.  In fact, everytime I hear about a child's death due to abuse, in a family that was already under investigation...  I always wonder how many vengeance cases that particular case worker had to deal with, in addition to their regular caseload.  I view the people that do that as bad as those who call 911 for stupid things.

That being said...  I understand and realize that the OP isn't considering this as a means of vengeance...  she is considering it for all of the right reasons, and should follow her gut instincts.  Worst case scenario (if the kids are not in danger), then the parents will at least realize that people do care, and are watching them.  Perhaps that alone will prompt them to slow down on the yelling.  But often, physical abuse is occurring in the homes where they do talk to their children that way.","1262327846"

1) your payment request for 2.5 bill is made to your credit card issuer

2) the issuer auto-raises your credit limit to the required level and then takes that loan and insures it with AIG. 

3) The Loan is then split up into 500 smaller subloans which are packaged in loan credit derivative amazon purchase banking credit products 

4) The derivative products are rated AAA by credit agencies for reasons nobody clearly understands

5) Dispite being hounded by nasty credit agencies, you fail to pay back the 2.5 billion loan

6) At the behest of paul krugman to ""save the economy"" The govt creates several billion in emergency Tarp relief funds to cover the cost of the product which it then gives to AIG, who then use it to pay large bonuses and the issuing bank which then takes approximately 40% of that money and hires lobbyists who blow the cash on hookers and golf trips for senators you've never met and probably didn't vote for

7) The bank takes the product away from you since you didn't pay up! A nasty mark is made on your credit file.

8) You and your kids and their kids and some kids after that for so many generations removed from your original loan that a 3rd arm is normal, pay for the bank's 2.5 billion dollar emergency relief loan with high taxes

so I started to piece it together... right now it looks like either:
a) subreddits can specify rules as to the length of time between a redditor's post, or....
b) moderators within the subreddit, if they don't particularly care for the content of a post, can impose a temporary time restriction on that user (yes I realize that may have sounded like a redundancy).

"programming","t5_2fwo","The Python is on of the world’s largest snakes. Pythons live near the equator, in Asia and Africa, where it is hot and wet and their huge bodies can stay warm. They make their homes in caves or in trees and have become used to living in cities and towns since people have been moving in on their territory.

Being closer to people means that not only will the snakes hunt the livestock (pigs, goats, dogs, cats and chickens), it also means that they may attack people when feeling threatened, although this rarely happens.

Speaking of feeling threatened, one of the biggest reasons that pythons are killed is for their large, beautiful skins. Some people actually like to wear snakeskin pants, vests, cowboy boots, and shoes! 

Pythons are constrictors, which means that they will ‘squeeze’ the life out of their prey. They coil themselves around their prey and with each breathe the creature takes the snake will squeeze a little tighter until they stop breathing completely. Once the heart stops the prey is swallowed whole. The entire animal is digested in the snake’s stomach except for fur or feathers. What do you think happens to the fur, feathers, beaks, and eggshells? The ‘extra stuff’ gets passed out as… you guessed it…snake POOP!

Along with farm animals, pythons will feed on wild animals such as lizards, caiman (small alligator-like animals), monkeys and antelope. The larger the meal, the longer it takes to digest. This means that a python may only need to eat 4-5 times a year!

The Green Tree Python is around 7 feet long and lives in…you guessed it...the trees! It waits in the leaves of the high forest branches and strikes out at birds as they fly by.

Pythons lay eggs and will coil their bodies around the eggs to keep them warm and protect them until hatching.","1262328073"

People tell me, ""Be grateful for what you have; there are people out there suffering much worse"".

"politics","t5_2cneq","You need to add to this assessment how much of the U.S. is tied up in getting paid by the ""Defense"" side of the government (you know, the part that is over 50% of the budget and creates all our deficits?). So, if they went against what the government is up to (generally = defense) they are basically killing their own jobs and maybe they'd get fired if their employers knew. This is one of the main reasons I'm interested in growing things like the space industry. Most of the gigantic defense companies could pretty easily change course to profiting from space ventures rather than taxpayers pocketbooks. Plus, does China or Al-Qaeda have a space-faring military branch yet? I think not (America = win).","1262328140"

On the other hand, I've had one really good friend I've known for 20 years. Even though we now live 13 hours apart we still see each other twice a year and talk on the phone about once a week. I would take a bullet for the guy and I'm pretty sure he would do the same for me.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Is morality real? Define morality. We at least know that behavior is real, and that different behavior effects different outcomes. This means we can reason about it. 

Is value real? Define value. We know that things exist and interact with each other. Value is simply ranking them. This is a type of reasoning. So, value is rational. 

The remaining question is then whether there is an observational basis of morality, ie whether our values correspond with physical reality. Much of our values are perhaps valid (rational) but unsound (unscientific or untested). Until we have a strong model of human behavior, using physical explanations, we lack a basis from which to reason about it. As a result, current morality is full of guesses and pseudoscience. What reasoning can there be about physical processes without a physical basis of knowledge? We are physical beings, thus morality is physical. 

What about some of the stranger moral questions? What if crimes such as murder, lying, and stealing could benefit in the end? We already have freedom of speech (and thus lying), but what if a particularly nasty and viral lie would almost certainly devastate a powerful nation? Here, the problem isn't rationality, we can reason fine about values and morals. It's observational. We have yet found a way of testing important assumptions about the physical system of life. 

We can't ignore morality. But it refers to physical processes that we don't yet understand. Until then, we can guess. The worst thing you can do now is think you've discovered an absolute morality that has no basis in physical reality (ie religion) and that must never be questioned (fundamentalism). People who haven't done that (atheists) are still not perfectly moral. 

One progress we could make would be to find equivalent behaviors, specifically, to relate totals (not to be confused with holism) and their parts, ie a nation and its constituents. For example, one resource we want people to have is time to think. This is likely improve life quite a lot, so it's equally likely moral to increase this. Here, I've found an equality between improving life and morality. Improving life is a big thing. But the act of doing this is a small thing. All I'm doing is showing that this is something that can be reasoned about. 

*Ultimately*, this is insignificant. But that doesn't make it impossible to think about nor irrational. ","1262328231"

Install the non-GPL VirtualBox on your Ubuntu machine and try out a bunch of distros. Take snapshots before you do something that could mess up.

I'd suggest starting with a minimal (non X) Debian then bringing it up to the same functional level as your Ubuntu install with aptitude, try adding just a few packages at a time and watch the dependencies. You can learn a lot about what's needed that way, and also learn how much the ""Debian Way"" has contributed to modern operating systems.

Then go for one of the Slackware variants. That'll give you experience with a tarball based distro, and a appreciation for both the effort and benefits of controlling your own software and OS. 

Finally, try Gentoo of LFS - by the time you get to them, you'll have a pretty good idea how a managed system fits together and how precompiled binaries can be used without a package manager. It'll reduce the chance that you'll make too many showstopper mistakes on the hand-built versions.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;Believe me I do not feel superior. Right and wrong are based on each persons own code of ethics. Mine states that Israel has an obligation to stay the home of the Jewish people, with a Jewish majority.

&gt;The Palestinaian code of ethics currently says that the Jews should get the hell out and return all of the land they ""stole"".

&gt;These two codes cannot co-exist, so things have to change. Since I am not willing to leave, and I am powerful enough to stay, the side that has to make the most accomodation, if they ever want to have a state, are the Palestinians.

A magnificent statement of the nihilist argument on behalf of Zionism.  Thank you.  I've saved the link.  Yes sir, you Israeli Jews are very powerful, and what the powerful man wants, he gets, and by golly he should get, and no more need be said.  Might makes right, ya know.  And so what if a Hitler or Stalin shared the identical ""code of ethics"" as yours?

The discussion on this thread is pretty much dead by now, and I wasn't planning on opening my mouth.  But your statement was such a brilliant encapsulation of the last best argument on behalf of Israel.  ","1262328341"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I know that's the official answer, but there are cases where the evidence is clearly real, legitimate and trustworthy.

I would totally understand an assumption under the law that held that any evidence found without due process should be considered tainted until proven otherwise. Fair enough, and logical. Consider the source and all that.

But I have an issue with a system that lets criminals off to punish the police for messing up. I think there are other ways to punish police that don't involve endangering the public, who had nothing to do with any of this.

I'm totally for all sorts of rules to curb police misconduct. But letting criminals go is not something I can get behind.

Here is an example: Cop does something wrong or improper and as a result finds a video tape of someone filming themselves committing a crime. In this case, the existence of the tape is independent of the officers actions.

Should the officer be punished? Sure. Should the tape be suspect and need to be checked by experts? You bet, check it thoroughly. Should the criminal be able to walk free to harm others due to a technicality? No, not in my opinion.","1262328353"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Evidence of advanced fusion devices at the WTC:

1. Pulverization of 99% of concrete into ultra fine dust as recorded by official studies. Concrete dust was created instantly throughout the towers when the fusion device million degree heat rapidly expanded water vapour 1000-fold in the concrete floors.

2. Superheated steels ablating (vaporizing continuously as they fall) as seen in video clips of the towers collapsing. This requires uniform temperatures roughly twice that of thermite. Conventional demolition or explosive charges (thermate, rdx, hdx etc.) cannot transfer heath so rapidly that the steel goes above it’s boiling temperature.

3. 22 ton outer wall steel sections ejected 200 meters into the winter garden. Cutting charges cannot eject heavy steels and throwing charges cannot provide the energy required without heavy, solid surface mounts.

4. 330 ton section of outer wall columns ripping off side of tower. Cutting charges cannot eject heavy steels linked together and throwing charges cannot provide the energy required without very heavy, solid surfaces to mount those charges.

5. Molten ponds of steel at the bottom of elevator shafts (WTC1, WTC2, WTC7). Massive heath loads have been present at the lower parts of these high-rise buildings. As one of the witnesses after seeing the flow of metals declared: “no one will be found alive”.

6. The spire behaviour (stands for 20-30 seconds, evaporates and goes down, steel dust remains in the air where the spire was). The spire did not stand because it lost its durability when the joints vaporized.

7. Sharp spikes in seismograph readings (Richter 2.1 and 2.3) occurred at the beginning of collapse for both towers. Short duration and high power indicate an explosive event.

8. A press weighting 50 tons disappeared from a basement floor of Twin Towers and was never recovered from debris. Not possible with collapses or controlled demolitions. The press was vaporized or melted totally.

9. Bone dust cloud around the WTC. This was found not until spring 2006 from the Deutsche Bank building. (In excess of 700 human remains found on the roof and from air vents). See http://www.911citizenswatch.org/print.php?sid=906

10. Fires took 100 days to extinguish despite continuous spraying of water. Thermate would burn out totally and then cool down much faster, just in a few days. This long cooling time means the total heath load being absorbed into the steels of the WTC was massive, far in excess anything found in collapses or typical controlled demolitions.

11. Brown shades of color in the air due nuclear radiation forming NO2, NO3 and nitric acid. TV and documentary footage changed the color balance to blue to disguise this fact indicating complicity in the coverup.

12. Elevated Tritium values measured in the WTC area but not elsewhere in New York. Official studies stated that 8 EXIT signs from two commercial Boeing jets were responsible. The tritium in those EXIT signs is insufficient to explain the measurements (very little tritium is available for measuring after evaporation into air as hydrogen and as tritiated water vapour. This can provide conclusive proof of fusion devices and therefore US/Israeli military involvement.

13. Pyroclastic flow observed in the concrete-based clouds. Only found with volcanic eruptions and nuclear detonations. The explosion squibs cool down just a few milliseconds after the explosion or after having reached some 10 meters in the air. Pyroclastic flow will not mix with other clouds meaning very serious heath in those clouds not possible with the conventional demolition or explosive charges. The pyroclastic clouds were cooling down at the WTC but this process took some 30 seconds. See http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1381525012075538113

14. Huge expanding dust clouds 5 times the volume of the building indicating extreme levels of heat generated far in excess of traditional demolition explosives.

15. Rubble height was some 10% of the original instead of 33% expected in a traditional demolition. Fusion device removal of underground central steel framework allowed upper framework to fall into this empty space and reduce the rubble height.

16. No survivors found, except some firefighters in one corner pocket in the rubble who looked up to see blue sky above them instead of being crushed by collapsing debris. Upward fusion flashlight-like beam of destruction missed this pocket but removed debris above those lucky firemen.

17. 14 rescue dogs and some rescue workers died far too soon afterward to be attributed to asbestos or dust toxins (respiratory problems due to alpha and tritium particles created by fusion are far more toxic)

18. Record concentrations of near-atomic size metal particles found in dust studies due to ablated steel. Only possible with vaporized (boiling) steels.

19. Decontamination procedure used at Ground Zero (hi-pressure water spraying) for all steel removed from site. Water spraying contains fusion radioactivity.

20. No bodies, furniture or computers found in the rubble, but intact sheets of paper covered the streets with fine dust. Items with significant mass absorbed fusion energy (neutrons, x-rays) and were vaporized while paper did not. Paper and powder theory.

21. 200 000 gallon sprinkler water tanks on the roofs of WTC1 and WTC2, but no water in the ruins. Heat of fusion devices vaporized large reservoirs of water.

22. Reports of cars exploding around the WTC and many burned out wrecks could be seen that had not been hit by debris. Fusion energy (heath radiation and the neutrons) caused cars to ignite and burn far from WTC site.

23. Wide area electrical outage, repairs took over 3 months. Fusion devices cause EM pulse with Compton scattering. See German engineers help the USA plate 5. http://home.debitel.net/user/andreas.bunkahle/defaulte.htm

24. EM pulse was recorded by broadcast cameras with high quality electronic circuitry. This occurred at the same time as the seismic peaks recorded by Lamont Doherty during the beginning of the collapse. This is due to the Compton Effect and resulted in a large area power outage at the WTC.

The entire point of the Netherlands stance on marijuana is to separate ""hard"" drugs from ""soft"" drugs, so that users of the latter are not exposed to the former, and if you look at the numbers you'll see the strategy is working.

You're confusing the Dutch's more compassionate treatment for heroin addicts with heroin ""tourism"" or an increased incidence of use of the drug.

The reason I enjoy Reddit much more than Digg is because of the comments.  It builds a sense of community, since you can go ""hey, I remember that guy/gal, he/she's really cool!""

It's not like other sites where the submitters, apart from powerusers, are faceless individuals.  Reddit is a community, and that's what makes it reddit.

Sure you can get stories- if I wanted only stories, then I could just read an AP feed or something.  I come to reddit especially for the comments.  They can make me laugh, they can make me think, and they can make me rethink what I once thought.  It may sound cheesy, but Reddit and its community full of awesome users and comments has shaped me into a lot of who I am now, mainly through my learned ability of puns for any occasions ;)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To cause terror you don't actually need to kill a lot of people or do anything particularly dramatic.  IMO the best way to go would be to have a bunch of snipers all around the country just like the DC sniper.  That way its random, not tied to large public spaces, we know the killers are still out there and haven't been caught (for a while at least) and maybe more importantly than any of that, there is absolutely nothing you can do to protect yourself from it except not go outside (and even that haven can be eliminated by occasionally picking off people in their houses).  More than anything fear is created by the thought that there is absolutely no place you can go and nothing you can do to be safe and as long as there is at least 1 killing a day in most of the major cities, this fear can be maintained indefinitely.

Even though it might ultimately cause less deaths or be less dramatic, I think this would inspire significantly more 'terror' than anything else.","1262328831"

"politics","t5_2cneq","due to this event I had to change job sites. A year later, at a gas station I saw a co-worker from the original site and she was compelled to tell me ""what happened."" She said the original complaint person was stealing money and was afraid I would notice, see, or otherwise find out, so this person embellished my everyday political views and supersized them, cooked up a big scary story. The point is the official police dept. was already primed to be the lacky of this sort of drama and the thief-complaintant was smart enough to use this opportunity to eliminate what they thought was a threat (me) to their stealing. The complainant did this action toward me with specific intent to get me removed from the job site, probably intending that I be fired or otherwise disappeared though that did not happen, I was simply transfered to a different site, likely due to the officer observing that I was sensible and moderate. I immediately realized that the officer was checking me out. I probably said as much or alluded to this while doing my work in a consistent and good natured manner.
I do not believe this situation would have occurred so automatically without the extreme tension in the air from the BushCo regime, that everyone was supposed to be on ""alert"" ad infinitum and find a scapegoat. This was also when people were driving around with ""get bin Laden"" target stickers on vehicles and the like. In retrospect, I did not express any particularly radical and certainly not any dangerous views. It was just that at the time, no one anywhere dared to say anything about anything and in this regard I may have been conspicuous.

Also, during the Reagan era, early on I saw that the man was a liar and bullshit artist and I was stunned at his popularity and how so many had their heart warmed up by this complete stranger. I think you and I are both naive, but in different ways.","1262328870"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Mmmmm....  Such fond memories I have of being institutionalized after a panic attack for which I went to the hospital; cajoled into taking an absurdly large dose of ziprasidone, against my better judgment, because they found me to be a bit oppositional and agitated (*); and having a severe episode of akathisia of which they denied all my requests for remedy because the psychiatrist on staff was the only one who could approve the administration of any medication and was too busy upstairs - jerking it for all I know - to come down and sign a piece of paper or call them to approve at least one of my requests.  I asked for clonidine, various beta-blockers, diphenhydramine, and all the other things I could think of to bring an end to my akathisia and the FUCKING BITCH OF A TECH just sat there with an irritated look on her face telling me to think happy thoughts.  I had to just tough it out over a period of several hours.  One of the worst experiences of my life and hellish beyond description.

*Dur?  I have a severe anxiety disorder, had been sleep-deprived, and was essentially put in prison - a stay that cost me $10,000, the price of a pretty decent vehicle - because, under the influence of 4 mg of lorazepam at the hospital, I casually remarked that I would rather die than have another panic attack.

I should have sued those incompetent (or sadistic?) bags of shit, but lucky for them I have some considerable learned helplessness, aboulia, emotional numbness, and apathy going on.  They've got quite the racket going on, to be sure.

Is it wrong for me to want to stab every doctor I see in the face?  I haven't ever met one who wasn't both a fucking douche and incompetent enough to leave me flabbergasted that they managed to make it through medical school.","1262329059"

Your system works only if the local laws are good. I thought that was so obvious that explicitly bringing up the classic lazy man's example of a state with bad laws would be superfluous.

It's not about the laws. If I say something should be a certain way, that doesn't, in my mind, translate to, ""our society should legally compel everyone to behave this way via a law.""

So far your system does not appear to distinguish in any way between, say,

""I believe that cyanide is nutritious, but I will refrain from serving it to my guests, because the laws in effect in my current time and place contradict that belief and thus require me to take that action.""

and

""I believe it that jews and gypsies and whatnot are real whole human beings, not inferior creatures, but I will participate in their persecution anyway, because the laws in effect in my current time and place contradict my belief and require me to take that action.""

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I don't think it's so much an argument against using hospital aid, but rather how the hospitals treat the process as a medical procedure that needs medication or a surgery.

The doctors that they interviewed were asked how many births they had attended were fully natural births (as in nothing to help contractions along, no needle into the spine to numb the pain) and it appears as though they haven't. In fact most patients are encouraged to take these medications (specifically an epidural) and so many of them do.

I've never giving birth, I don't care either way (because I honestly can give no opinion on how painful birthing is and yadda yadda) but it is the mother's choice to have an epidural if they want or whatever, but I don't think the doctors should encourage it (I've been with friends when they've gone to the doctor and I've heard some say ""Some women find the pain of giving birth to be too much and so maybe you would like to get an epidural for the pain"" before they're actually *in* labour and know whether they're going to be able to handle it or not and will write it in for a birth plan so that as soon as the woman is at the hospital, whether she's decided she can handle it or not she's getting pumped full of medication) as much as they do.

The person I'm probably closest to now lives on the other side of the country and we speak maybe twice a year when he calls me; we both discuss shit by email semi regularly, about on the same level as the conversations here at Reddit, actually. I'm able to make friends with the people I'm around during the day quite easily, but I've never had any interest in maintaining relationships beyond the point where I'm not already interacting with people regularly. I don't keep in touch with classmates, hell, I can't remember most of their names. Of my good friends from when I was in school, I'm only still in occassional contact with one of them, despite living in the same city as him; I simply don't often go out of my way to spend time with him. Of that same group, I haven't spoken to the one that I shared an apartment with for a couple years after graduation in a decade, except for a single afternoon. No bad blood or anything, I just never feel any desire to contact people. Likewise with previous workplaces; I always manage to get along with and befriend a reasonable number of the people I see at work, but once I'm not working there, I never contact any of those people again.

Inside an `except` statement, it is sometimes useful to see if you can handle the error, and if you can't, raise the same error again.  However, that loses your traceback.  Instead, call `raise` without any arguments to raise the same exception again with traceback intact, like so:

    except E:
        raise

You can arbitrarily add properties to objects:

    # prints 'Hello, world'
    obj.__dict__['hello'] = 'Hello, world'
    print obj.hello

Binders are just functions, so you can use them functionally:

    class foo:
        def __init__(self,i):
            self.i = i + 1 # dumb thing to do, but it's just an example

    items = map(foo,items) # stuff in items is all instances of foo now

Properties can be separated away from their object and still affect the original:

    foo = []
    bar = foo.append
    bar(1)
    bar(2)

2) If you want a tuple with one value, make sure to do (x,) and not (x). (x) evaluates to x. This can be an issue with sql functions that take parametrized arguments.

But also look at it this way: if you took her mouth, and shot her in the mouth it would be dominant.  If you took her tits and shot her in the tits then it would be dominant.  If you ordered her to give you a hand job it would be dominant.  You can use any part of her... so why would it not be dominant if you ordered her to put on stockings, tied her knees and ankles together, put her on all fours at the end of the bed, walked around behind and pushed her feet together around your dick and gave yourself a foot job and shot all over the backs of her legs?  You can work up from there and take anything else you wanted.

You want to kiss her lips you do it.  You want to kiss her breasts, you do it.  You want to kiss her pussy you do it.  You want to tie her on her back to the bed with her legs suspended from a hook in the ceiling, then lick her toes and foot on the way down her leg to her pussy then you go right ahead.

Or, some girls like being just a table.  Some girls like being made to suck whatever comes through the hole in the wall.  I'm sure there's a girl out there that doesn't mind being just a pair of feet in stockings hanging out from under the covers, or sticking out of a pair of stocks or something.  

If she's into humiliation you can work her up to near orgasm with toys or whatever, then tell her her pussy, ass, and mouth aren't worthy of your cock, so you'll just take her stocking feet because you know the stockings are clean.  Well, until your'e done that is.

As for porn... well, make your own.  You're probably not alone and could make some money. :)

Bottom line, if she's agreed that you're the dominant (consensual), it's within the limits you've discussed (communication), no one is getting injured (permanently), and no safe words have been said... well get your freak on son.  Go get it.  ;)","1262329647"

The community has momentum and it really feels as though this is the future of Lisp. I have completely stopped using Common Lisp in favour of Clojure.

[There's a series of blogs translating Practical Common Lisp into Clojure](http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/9/16/pcl-clojure). I'd add those to your list of resources. PCL is worth a read whichever Lisp you choose to learn.","1262329689"

There are only like 13 episodes of good shows per season, like 30 Rock or It's Always Sunny and yet I'm paying TWICE as much while getting half the amount of episodes than I normally would have even a few years ago. Worst of all, they took away good shows like Arrested Development, Futurama, etc. and have stupid fucking reality T.V. shows and more Seth McFarlame incarnations. But I do still enjoy the meatier shows today though, as some programming has definitely advanced; many shows on HBO and other cable companies are getting better in quality, so at least we can have that and not watch The Hills...","1262329690"

It would be a godsend to people like myself who have very bad memories for names and faces.  With enough storage and an advanced imaging system, you could essentially lifelog everything that happens to you.  A very helpful system would then categorize the events, people, places, etc. that you experience and be able to pull them up as as, essentially, an artificial memory.  Walk down the street and see an old classmate, and the system would pop up his name and maybe a list of facts about him that you would normally have forgotten.  Or maybe as you're talking to someone and you make a plan to meet later, it is automatically put in your schedule and you'll be reminded at an appropriate time.  

For me, next to a genetic or nanotech alteration of myself, something like this would be one of the most useful things that I could have in the next decade.  It would be an extension of my brain and my memory.

There isn't the stigma attached to helping out a mental ill person. I was in Sri Lanka, staying at the home of a poorish woman, and a mentally ill homeless man knocked on her door asking for help. She invited him in, fed him, and gave him her bed to sleep on. That would never happen in the US. 

And just because they are financially poor by our standards doesn't necessarily mean they are poor. The people I met in Sri Lanka lived off the fruit and vegetables in their gardens and the fish they caught from the sea.

His roommate TOLD them it was a diabetic seizure.  That's the ONLY reason they were there.  The patient himself was lying on the ground, and the EMT asked the cop to help lift him.  His arm then flailed and whacked the EMT.

The cop then tased him ELEVEN TIMES for a total of *56 seconds*.  That's just time he was holding down the trigger, mind, the whole tazing would have taken longer, but try and imagine (basically) a full minute of constant electrocution.

The cross product of vectors is defined as the determinant of a matrix. This is also understood to be the area of a parallelogram made with the vectors as its sides.

So, if I see a big screen TV I would like to buy and it is $699--I would wait at least 70 days before actually buying it. AND, if the price has changed more than 10%, the waiting period restarts--so if the TV is now $599 at the end of my 70 day waiting period, I have to wait another 60 days, etc, etc.

BTW, my microwave conked out today--everything works except the actual heating-the-food part. I estimate the replacement cost at $79.00 so I will be waiting 8 days to buy a new one--at least...I may just not replace it and enjoy the extra counter space instead.","1262330076"

No they don't. They can't simply take away your CD key so you can't play the game at all. They can ban you from their servers so you can't play multiplayer, but that's it. Valve has the right to disable your account.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I find your interpretation of the lynching comment wildly charitable, though we can agree to disagree. 

As for the actual motivations of Stalin and Mao, again, their lack of interest in a literal deity does not matter. Christians can and do argue that humanism is murderous in a ""direct cause"" sort of way, regardless of whether it is deity-oriented or not. (Christians would further argue that Stalin, Mao et al were in fact ""worshipers;"" they simply worshiped the state and themselves as ultimate wielders of power rather than a metaphysical god.) 

The main point stands that the arguments on both sides are remarkably similar. Justification of the statement ""religion kills and we should fear it"" looks remarkably like justification of the statement ""humanism kills and we should fear it."" There are elements of supporting evidence both logical and illogical for both points of view. 

And my broader point, yet again, is not in reference to splitting hairs, ice cream sandwiches, or what have you. It is that when atheists turn up the volume and the emotion to a certain degree, they start acting ""religious"" in respect to their personal holy cause in the manner that Hoffer cites. That's all. It is not an indictment of atheism, just an indictment of immature enthusiasm, which can at times be a red flag for deeper insecurities and weaknesses. ","1262330085"

The drug warriors are nearly totally bereft of any argument in support of this atrocity, but they are right about one thing: if you can keep a person from using drugs as a kid, the odds that they will use as an adult go way, way down.

Why should women be bound to one man, when men aren't bound to one women? It's like women are getting the short end of the stick. Guys use porn, women use romantic novels? No way.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6"," Okay forewarning: I am drunk, and I almost have my associates in psychology. Also my abnormal psych teacher pushed his theory down our throats. So, if you strongly disbelieve, or have information against this PLEASE share it with me. I am also presenting myself with a disadvantage because I am quite drunk, and I know my information in the field is limited.

Sydney Walker disapproves modern day ""psychology"" for two main reasons. 1) Most people are misdiagnosed stating most abnormal psychological behavior is because of biological reasons. 2) Modern day psychology is in ""bizarro land""[read: bizarro = comic book term for disfunctional],because some of diagnosis were created in questionable terms such as: homosexuality(used to be in DSM,but not now),good house wife syndrome(the book says this abnormal behavior was decided upon a few ""powerful"" men on a boat trip after they were drinking.(It is now not as well)

Okay, so the book is divided into chapters by case studies. He states how this patient was titled schizophrenic(insert random diagnosis) by most therapists before they came to him as a last resort. The medium is how he tries to figure out the biological symptoms. It ends with how he came to a biological conclusion. The schizophrenic behavior was caused by Syphilis(insert biological cure, instead of psychological medicine). He cures the Syphilis with anti-biotics and the schizophrenic behavior is gone.

In conclusion:  The author believes psychology needs more of a ""unf"" than just ""thought-theory."" to grow into the ""everyone curable with the right medicine"" field it has transformed into.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","2tb? this sounds relatively easy. it'll take some manual work, but its not hard. the computer will take much more time to do things that you'll have to.

1. start with a new pc just because it makes it easier to keep things separate. 

2. buy the biggest drive you can (2TB?) and add it as an external. for the purposes of the tutorial, i'm assuming you have less than 2tb in total.

3. on the external, make a folder called ""old hard drives""

4. create subfolders called ""(approx year of drive)-(Type of Drive(System|Data|Progs|whatever)-(volume label or some kind of note to help you remember when it was being used last). 

5. move all the data from each smaller hdd to the new appropriate subfolder on the external.

6. after moving the data (or copy/delete if you're paranoid) format those drives and make sure there is no data left. do not keep it lying around ""just in case"" then you'll have the problem over again in a few years.


7. now run a duplicate finder over those folders. depending on the file type, you can just delete the older ones and keep the most recent, or if they're program executable and config files, just delete them. i'm assuming here that you've already noted down the names of the apps you really want to reinstall later on the new pc. if there are any settings files you need to keep now is not the time to delete them :) make a copy of those files outside of the ""old hard drives"" folder. make a note of the directories they were from. you'll be amazed at how much gets duplicated, and at how much space you'll get back at the end of it.   

8. after de-duplicating everything you can, the instructions get more tedious to write and changing depending on the data type and how much time you have and how many ocd habits you need to expend. if you want me to continue, reply, or drop me a pm. 


i have around 4tb of stuff that i want to keep for a long time. its nearly 90% organised. everything i care about is well organised. some of the file types that interest me less, are less organised. i figure keeping the hard disks organised keeps me off the streets, and thats a good thing for everybody, so i keep doing organising. one day it'll be close to perfect, and then i'll add a crapload more and start over. 


**Protip:** ESATA is so much faster than USB2.0. 

**Protip:** if the deduplicator has the option, export the list of duplicates to be deleted to a  batch file, and then review the batch file before running it to make sure nothing important goes by mistake

**Protip:** [Sequoiaview](http://www.win.tue.nl/cgi-bin/usr/sequoia/download3.cgi) [Windows only] is awesome for finding those large space consuming files you'd forgotten about

While the audience does not know it just yet, Jesus Christ is going to the that high priest who sacrifices animals to atone for His people's sins and release the goat into the wilderness to remove their sins.  Except this high priest is the propitiation and expiation for His people sins.

Jesus was further clarifying while you, as a believer in Him as Lord and Savior are no longer under condemnation of the law because of what He has done, does not mean that the law is being wiped away.  He states this by stating Deuteronomy 6, The Greatest Commandment.  All laws go back to loving the Lord with all of your might, heart and soul and second, love your neighbor (aka another human being per the Parable of the Great Samaritan).

* 2.)  someone should post that the replays do not actually begin until 4:something.

* 3.)  the african-american-sounding commentator said 'the moment of troof'.  see: 4:24ish.

The fries they serve now are ok, but not even a shadow of what they used to be. The beef flavor added to them now does not make up for it, not by a long shot.

I'm sorry, no, because I lack the vocabulary to make sense of the answer. My matrix algebra review book assumes I know the same terms, so it doesn't explain either. From what I can grasp:

i,j: does i mean row number and j column number?
k: I can't figure out what k is...a given value in the matrix? a product?

&gt;This is also understood to be the area of a parallelogram made with the vectors as its sides. So basically the determinant is the scale that you transform the sides of the parallelogram to make it not be a square. Does that make sense?

Do you mean like if i have a matrix of equations that involve uses of say a, b, c, d a and y, and I just want to isolate the values of x and y, i apply a transformation to the matrix that leaves me with a new, one-column two-value matrix containing the values of x and y?","1262330553"

"politics","t5_2cneq","When you get to this point, this is when you need to separate the ideas of the Founding from the base America. Again, the ideas of the Founding and the values they shared are the general rule. You list exceptions, and the reason that they don't contradict my argument is because of the main reason for the Founding: political freedom. The Founders were after political freedom, and the reason that there is a legal Communist Party, legal KKK, legal dissent in other words, is because political freedom exists. 

Now, are they really ""American""? Depends on what you mean by the term. If you argue that only those who hold entirely by the ideas and values of the Founding are ""real Americans"", they might not be. If you argue that, due to the political freedom that lies at the heart of the Founding, those who dissent from those values are still ""American"", they are.

Now, I suppose you could take this to the extreme and ask me about someone who hates liberty, equality, democracy, justice, and all the values or truths that America is founded upon. Well, no. If we're arguing about citizenship based off of ideology rather than, say, birth, and if their ideology is completely and utterly in opposition to the generally-held American values, I'd have a hard time calling that person American. Keep in mind that this person wouldn't even be trying to convince others to change their minds and agree with his/her's stance, as that would be a democratic appeal. I'd wonder why that person would have any interest at all in either being an American citizen or living in America. Would it be right for America to kick them out? No, because this act would suggest a lack of political freedom, which is a core value that is widely, if not completely held, even if the dissenter disagrees.","1262330561"

"math","t5_2qh0n","Ok, you need to start from the beginning.

so a linear equation is any equation relating variables where all you are doing is multiplying each variable by some amount, and then adding them together.  Here are some examples:

    x=y
    2x+4y=z
    x+y+10z=0
    a+b+c+d+3e+9f+2g=h
    a+c=b+d-e

Now, basically, linear equations turn up in a lot of things.  They are easy to manipulate, and simple to understand.  The reason they are called linear is because when you graph them, they look like **line**s (well, actually the causation might be the other way around.)

Now, a linear transformation is related, but a bit different.  First you need to get an understanding of vectors, though.

EDIT: I'm sorry I'm too lazy to explain vectors and linear transformations, hopefully someone else will pick up the slack.","1262330616"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Do you really think the money you spend or don't spend on video games is going to affect the industry as a whole? Its a multi-million dollar industry. What fraction of a percent of that millions of dollars do you contribute every year?

You can't control what thousands of other people do, and their money in aggregate is going to decide whether a company lives or dies. Your money isn't going to matter either way in the grand scheme of things. 

I figure I might as well send a message by not paying for games that have incredibly stupid bullshit on them. When game companies provide reasonably priced products that don't punish people for buying legitimate copies (because that's what SecuROM is) then I'll consider paying for them.","1262330628"
