"COVID19","t5_2f4l19","A bit OT, but still about treatment:  

So 80% of infected are ""relatively"" ok but 20% go on to need hospitalization.  YouTube's ""MedCram"" has discussed the past two days (March 30 &amp; 31) about assisting a person's immune system to prevent *needing* hospitalization.  Yeah, the person gets sick but not to such a level.  

What was discussed?  Hydrothermal techniques--very hot temps to very cold temps to very hot temps...like Finnish saunas.  

NOT as a cure in any way, but boosting the immune system right when you need it boosted.  And no fancy anything required, except a working tub.  That even if that 20% is reduced to 15%, that's a reduction by 25% of the number of people hospitalized (that 5% less is 1/4 of the original 20%--and can make a big difference).  

Note: Ironically, we removed our tub last Fall.  So I guess HOT showers then cold--even if it helps just a bit, it could make the difference between ""moderately bad"" and ""really bad""--and that may be enough.",1585699200

* Use of playgrounds, dog parks, public picnic areas, and similar recreational areas is prohibited. These areas must be closed to public use.
* Use of shared public recreational facilities such as golf courses, tennis and basketball courts, pools, and rock walls is prohibited. These facilities must be closed for recreational use.
* Sports requiring people to share a ball or other equipment must be limited to people in the same household.
* Most construction—residential and commercial—is prohibited. There are eight types of exceptions including for affordable housing, work on healthcare facilities, homeless shelters and certain types of public works projects. 
* Funerals limited to no more than 10 people attending.
* Childcare facilities may only provide care to children or dependents of people working for essential businesses, providing essential governmental functions, or performing minimum basic operations for non-essential businesses.

    The counties participating in these strict orders are:  Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Santa Clara, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Berkeley

    The other counties added that their original shelter-in-place mandates still hold: Residents may only leave their home for grocery trips, doctor's appointments and walks around their neighborhood.

I'm not on the verge at all. Québec solidaire bud 😷

You see? We are who we are. Stereotypes exist for a reason. I've always been this way and probably will remain so, despite the tremendous pressure and attempts to shame me coming from WASPs and their immigrant imports. You won't assimilate me to your suicide cult, and I will be sure to warn anyone in Quebec considering moving here about just how pervasive and aggresive the two-faced xenophobia is. 

I seriously don't mind that you're xenophobes. What bothers me is that you pretend you're not. It's incredibly obnoxious.

&gt; I gotta ask, why did you come to Waterloo if youre that into anti assimilation. Tho kinda ironic since Waterloo pretty much destroyed the french supremacy that used to exist in Europe. 

I was born in KW. I didn't choose to come here and now that I have the financial and career prospects to leave, I am doing so as soon as possible. Not ironic at all, Waterloo is a bastion of progressive WASP nonsense. 

&gt; Loi 101 stop a lot of people from going in english school, they had to pay stupid amount of money just to learn english. Plus they had that loi 104 just to screw people a bit more cuz why not

Based. Before you ask, I also support Loi 21. 

&gt; a more sensible thing to do is just not forceful destroy peoples culture and not block immigrants.

That's not how WASPs function, first of all. They are incessantly aggressive with their forced assimilation. You're trying to do it to me right now, calling me all sorts of buzzwords that basically only exist in English to shame people who go against their way of doing things.

A sensible thing to do is stay the fuck home, have kids and raise them in their culture.

&gt; Nah lol you see i complain about Anglos and French eradicating their language, loi 101 being one of them.

Loi 101 was also about protecting the French language in Quebec. As were the follow-up additions.",1585699201

An agni kai is basically a challenge for honour, which is something very integral to the fire nation (at least during sozin—&gt;ozai’s reign). It’s more ritualistic and/or spiritually significant than earth rumble 6. 
A bunch of earthbenders with their meme gimmicks like Fire Nation Man make it more akin to Televised wrestling. 

You could compare an agni kai to a fight like pakku and katara have in book one, but again, there isn’t any cultural significance like an agni kai— what with the invited spectators, scheduled time and all that.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:

1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed.
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person.
3. If you are trading shiny Pokémon, please make sure that your post and other users’ offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pokémon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

US aircraft that are actually good fighters at low altitude tend to make mediocre CAS, and vice versa. The P-47 is a miserable low altitude fighter. The F6F is alright, but carries substantially less payload. The best low altitude fighter the US gets is the P-63, which only carries at most two drops worth of ordnance, and only 500lb bombs at that. Corsairs are a middle ground, but have fairly limited payloads.

Meanwhile on the German side, the Bf 110 G-2 is a better fighter than half the US CAS lineup, as is the He 219. Fw 190 F-8 is a veritable swiss army knife of ordnance options and still flies and fights like a 190 when clean, Ta 152 C-3 is a monster in a dogfight and carries a centerline MK 103. The Me 410s are roughly on par with the P-47 in terms of dogfighting, so not *great* but they come with turrets, dive brakes, and either twin MK 103s, a BK 5, or two separately-released 500kg bombs.

Drag is what makes this impossible. We see Sazed store his weight and float out of a tree in the original trilogy. Wax would be doing the same if he didn’t have A-steel. 

We see Wax accelerate when he stores weight during a A-steel push because he is actively adding energy to his body at a now reduced weight via the push. Without that, his wind resistance due to drag would slow him immediately. 

I personally think the most impressive ability one might gain with F-iron is the ability to fly via a winged suit. Think, bat suit. The only reason people can’t fly with a wing suit (like we all made out of cardboard if you had a charmed childhood lol) is people are too heavy.

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","Usually unemployment is only for people who were laid off or fired, and you have to be at a job for more than a year to qualify. They recently changed it so that it's possible to qualify for with slightly less time, but definitely not five months. If you had been fired or laid off of your current job AND the one you left in Boston, together that time could add up to a year.

Yes, it seems unfair. It's just bad luck that you quit a job and was only at a job for a certain amount of time before this happened. A lot of people are in the same situation. 

That's what the stimulus check is for: people who don't have any other aid coming for them. (Even then, it's not enough to really avoid financial ruin)

You can apply for social security income and food stamps but that will be less than $1000 a month. The post office is hiring, as is Jewel, Costco, Amazon, and most grocery stores. That might be the best bet to keep some money coming in while this goes on.",1585699205

The level that was elevated was their reason on why i couldn't consume gluten. One said i will be able to once i fix my gut the other said i wont ever be able to consume gluten. But majority of all this going on in our gut, not a single person or doctor can tell you what the future is. The microbiome is just to complex and it can change at any point. Every doctor I went to all gave me different answers and different protocols. Each person is different and it all starts from the day your born. So I'll just continue trying to fix it and maybe one day I'll try gluten again just to see what happens. But as for now, I'm going to stay away from it.",1585699205

"OrlandoMagic","t5_2s5vq","Oh how we forget how McGrady was dragging his body up and down the court in Houston after his first season there, as his body failed him and turned into an inefficient chucker. We also forget that Grant was relatively healthy after his first four years and even made the all-star game once. It's a decent comparison. Both had injury issues (Grant was simply out whereas Tracy would try to play but was obviously hampered and ineffective), both had one extraordinary season with a lot of mediocrity, and both were on max contracts with their team trying to figure out a way around them. The big difference was Houston also had Yao with injuries and still had some success. That'd be like those early 2000s Magic teams still making the playoffs with Grant *and* McGrady out. That Rockets team has always been managed so well, up and down.

McGrady's years in Houston resulted in a 105 ORtg (which is a tap above league average), bad shooting numbers, high turnover numbers (somehow higher than in Orlando when he had no one to help at all), and, as always, no playoff success. He was viewed as a bad contract, traded with a bunch of other bad contracts in a 3 team trade to the Knicks, where he continued on as a bench guy, which he didn't just magically turn into upon putting a Knicks jersey on.

Boiling Tracy's Houston numbers down to counting stats tells the wrong tale. It's why no one uses counting stats anymore",1585699205

And please, point me out to where the Constitution grants businesses the right to simplified legislation. Here's a hint, it's not in there. Sure, it should be simplified, but so should the tax code, so should insurance, so should voting, and so should be applying for unemployment or food stamps. None of those are the case, why should we prioritize an entity that only exists on paper over living, breathing Americans?

And you are 100% correct about federal regulations overriding state regulations, when the state regulations are not as strict. However, that is not an explicit override, companies must follow all non-conflicting and relevant regulations wherever they do business. The level only matters when they explicitly conflict and cannot follow both.",1585699206

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","There's media gag orders on reporting this sort of thing because of how young people who are getting groomed are.

This robbery:

The youth was the one who killed as part of gang grooming and initiation.  But because of their age the media is mostly forbidden from covering the children.  All we know is that the 13 year old boy was convicted of first degree murder but given a reduced sentence due to grooming.

As I said, it happens.  But there isn't a lot of coverage due to our gag order laws on the topic.

But we actually have an anti-grooming strategy in Canada because of how common it is:

If it bleeds it leads, and the media does at times make it sound like we’ll all be locked down forever and society will collapse from being overrun by the virus, which does feed panic. The reality is it is gonna be shitty next few weeks, but if everyone follows social distancing, washes their hands, stays home and the governments keep up the legislation any indication says that the peak will come in April, the worst will be over by May, and by May/June we can slowly start to reopen back to normal around June/July.

Whether you accept aid from the US is a complex question which depends on a lot of factors but at the end of the day

1) you are either sufficiently desperate to accept the aid regardless

2) you aren't in a position to refuse because of the diplomatic/political consequences

3) your country is or was sufficiently close to the US that it's complicit in the things you mentioned anyway

4) the US hates you and is never going to give you anything anyway


Most of the time if you don't like something the US is doing, you send a message via the diplomatic service or you raise it at the UN General Assembly (neither of which are likely to produce results if the US doesn't feel like it)",1585699206

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Ethics aren't so simple as that.  Are you starving to death and theft is your only option to survive?  Then yeah, not too many people will fault you for some pretty theft.  Normal ethics don't always translate well to disaster situations.  You normally wouldn't squat in someone's house, but if a hurricane destroyed your home and flooding cut your route of escape off then no one should blame you if you break into an empty home for shelter.  You are acting as if the only ethical considerations here are contracts and property rights.  The situation is far more complex than that.  
  

The ethics of it isn't the end of the story anyway.  Even if you think starving people should just starve to death instead of stealing, that's not going to prevent starving people from stealing food.  In fact, your ethical opinions are very likely to go out the window if you are the one starving.  Likewise, people facing homelessness during a pandemic aren't going to be operating under their normal ethical compass.  They will act out of self preservation.",1585699207

2. On a monthly basis adjust the rent downward to the market rate. This also makes you look good

* North Korea lies on an axis between China (major geopolitical rival), South Korea, and Japan

* North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, perhaps upwards of 60 as of 2020, with at least a few capable of hitting Washington D.C.

* North Korea is also an ideological enemy. Much like China, Vietnam, and Cuba, they are a communist state. Much like China and Vietnam, they don't actually practice orthodox Marxist-Leninism. And much like China and Cuba, they are actually hostile to the aims of the USA (Vietnam being friendly is why we don't mess with them). 

* The media decided they're ***the*** ""Orwellian nightmare state""  and don't think people have big enough attention spans to care about more than one nightmare state.


Turkmenistan isn't even the worst of the lot. I'd argue that title goes to Eritrea, which has [unironically enslaved most of its population](https://eritrea-focus.org/eritrea-has-second-highest-number-of-people-living-in-slave-like-conditions/) and also ranks [worse in press freedom than North Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-10/eritrea-beats-north-korea-as-world-s-most-censored-country).

In the past few days I've tried to negotiate the reality of what works and what doesn't in the new event, and no one has given any leeway in the way of being reasonable. I can understand the growing apathy to DE improving the quality of their releases since Liches, the rest of the year before that seemed good, and every update since has launched in a broken/semi-broken state that encouraged those attitudes. I'm not sure what's been happening behind closed doors at DE that's allowed things to turn out like they have, but the only thing more dangerous than the game coming out in such disrepair, is the community encouraging such apathy. Given, the apathy originally comes from the places where DE has failed, but recently the resentment has become so much so that this subreddit seems to completely dis-acknowledge any good things that DE does, exacerbate the bad things to the point of bullying sometimes, and as of late, twisting the image of the game towards an unfix-able, black void of terribleness that is beyond redemption. The posts for Scarlet Spear on other subreddits like pcgaming had top comments warding people away from the event like it was a quarantine zone. There are some definitively good things about this event like how easy it is obtain Arcanes, but people I've talked to deny even simple things like the despite overwhelming evidence. When we get to this point where people refuse to respond with hateful emotions rather than reason, it is hard to steer back.

I understand your frustration, I do, DE needs to iron these kinks out sooner (This new situation with work-from-home does make me more sympathetic to their plight when it comes to bugs in the near future, but understanding this won't makes the bugs any fewer). But you just being honest about your feelings like you just did undid a bit of that animosity, and channeled it into something that makes the dialogue on this forum much better already. If you don't believe enough in DE to fix their game, at least have the confidence to be able to engage with the other people in the community candidly about the kind of things you displayed here.

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","He does have solid TDD, I'll give you that. He held Maia to a decision (although why it was split I'll never know), which is super impressive. Usually if Maia gets your back it's just a matter of time. 

That said, Woodley was legendary for his TDD before the Usman fight. He's still at 92%, actually. He held Maia to 0 takedowns (he grabbed the cage for two of them, but 2 out of...23? I think, isn't bad) and never got into that situation at all. And Usman grappled him at will. Brought him down twice, pounded him against the fence, won a 50-44 decision against someone with far better TDD. 

Jorge is at 78% TDD in his career, and couldn't hold the same against Maia. And he's going to be dealing with Usman, someone who isn't necessarily looking to finish on the ground, someone who is happy to just sit there and pound you for 25 minutes. 

For striking, if you look, Usman actually has mostly better striking stats than Jorge. The latter has much fancier boxing for sure, and it's obviously effective, but I wouldn't give him a huge edge over Usman if any. Especially what we saw in his fight Colby (and even some of his fight with Woodley), Usman is not afraid to stand and swing, and he's very good at it. It's not flashy, but it works really well.

Finally I look at their competition. Usman's resume is far better than Jorge's as of late. 

Last five for Jorge 3-2: Maia (L), Thompson (L), Till (W), Askren (W), Diaz (W).

Last five for Usman 5-0: Meek, Maia, RDA, Woodley, Colby.

Not only did he increase drastically in competition, he smashed the last two completely in ways that he really shouldn't have been able to, when people were talking before the fights. 

Sorry man, Usman just has the edge completely. He should dominate any grappling, should probably at least hold his own standing up (if not take the edge), and that leaves Jorge with a puncher's chance to win. Jorge is good. He's top 5 for sure. But he's not Usman caliber, and until he fights someone that seems like they should be up there, I can't give it to him in any way but chance.

Then again, I might be surprised if they fight. Maybe Jorge just submits him quick or something, or outboxes him over 5 rounds. Very possible. Just very unlikely imo.",1585699211

The more I read about this the more I think this is more about hospital liability than keeping their staff safe. **This** is why in the US the hospitals probably demanded the CDC downgrade the level of PPE by law so they can't get sued.  
So in the case of a paper mask that is CDC ""approved"" and a N95 of ""unknown origin"" they'd rather the staff wear the paper mask even though its _obviously_ less effective because they won't get sued in that outcome. I imagine the greatest fear is a non-COVID-19 patient in the hospital getting the virus from the staff and suing the hospital. In such a case I guess they want to be able to state they were following the CDC guidelines because that will stand up in court more strongly.",1585699215

She was suicidial, had past childhood trauma, and abandonment issues. 

After our first date, she told me she loves me and immediately wanted me to be her boyfriend. I know I know, I was an idiot and missed all these red flags. It eventually got to the point where she got violent (not just with me, but other people as well). My breaking point was when she threatened to call the cops on me during an argument.

And,  I don't know,  I think I may be assuming things cos of how toddlers and lil kids are supposed to be like. As in,  they eat more and pack on the weight as they get ready for a growth spurt... 

But I kind of think that when they're all active,  they're bingeing on all the calories they can get,  then when they go quiet for a few days, they hibernate and pack on the weight and do some major growing.  They are hibernating as their whole focus is on growing, instead of kicking and being restless. 


Of course,  I could be completely full of shit.  But after that happening a few times and getting really concerned,  this thought reassures me.

"LeaguePBE","t5_2wnyi","I love everything about the skin! I predicted EXACTLY these 3 champions were gonna get a coven skin eventually and it came true and even better with a legendary morgana skin. But what I feel like could be added to zyra’s skin is specifically the ultimate. The ultimate is good but I feel like it needs some more “oomf” so I think you can add more roses around the ultimate circle to make it more “seductive and creepy witch” typa vibe and for the splash art for zyra u guys should make the face less circular because zyras base face is more of a thin, toned shaped oval and coven’s is too circular so I think it would be good if it was more longer and less circular and compressed into her face but otherwise the skins are fantastic!",1585699217

"MSILaptops","t5_2y4t7","Here is a better idea, here is a video on how it was done by myself and also Benchmark results before and after.

https://youtu.be/ywk6mrlBISs

As for the parts you will need the following

MSI GTX1060/1070 MXM GPU (Yes you can get a 1070 working in this laptop)

MSI GT72VR-6RD or GT72VR-6RE GPU Heatsink 6RD is GTX1060 and 6RE is GTX1070, if you have the skylake GT72-6QD there is no need to modded that heatsink.

You can look on eBay for either parts, just make sure if you go for a GTX1070 do not get one that came out of a MSI Vortex system as they had a fault batch of 1070's. Look for any revisions above 1.0 best is 1.1/1.2. As G-Sync will not work after the modification you will loose the 75hz however I have my EDID I use to gain the 75hz back however gsync will be still missing on the internal display.

Also you will need to modify the GPU drivers each time as MSI didn't make a bios update that would allow for PnP driver installs.

So the question is are you willing to put the work and time into it.",1585699219

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Is there something wrong with my comment? I’m just stating facts. Sorry to burst your AMD safe bubble. The fact is EPYC CPUs can't run some x86 programs as well as Xeons, and Intel purposely limits some programs to run worse on AMD CPUs, which is a huge selling point when you're looking for a server.

1. Nearly all the coding done in the last 30 or 40 years have been done for Intel cpus were as AMD have had to re-encode it into there instruction set but do it differently so as not to infringe Intel copywrite. AVX encoding is were Intel have a clear advantage, so programs that take advantage of this instruction set run faster on Intel.
2. Used hardware wise Xeon is going to be 1) super common and relatively cheap and 2) available in generations that can use cheaper DDR3 memory as opposed to DDR4 in new systems.
3. Complex mathematical compute workloads (e.g., eigenvector calculations). If you use matlab or numpy for these workloads the default blas system they use is intel MKL. MKL runs horribly on the zen architecture and you need to use OPENBLAS instead for performance gains. Unfortunately OPENBLAS is still behind MKL for a variety of workloads. This one will likely never get ""better"". It's in Intels best interest to keep crippling MKL on zen architecture and OPENBLAS seems to be optimized and updated by a small team. I doubt they will ever beat MKL in performance.
4. Broadcom NICs are a huge dealbreaker as well as the lack of support from MS on the virtualization side. Literally don't support features that all other virtualization providers do for AMD CPUs.
5. Intel and AMD don't mix well in a virtualization environment, and virtualizing network functions (router, firewall, adc, etc) using dpdk heavily favors Intel Xeon right now. Which means hardware momentum matters even if the person with sway is willing to use AMD.",1585699220

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I completely disbelieve the notion that a mediocre male athlete will transition their gender, with the social, psychological and physical toll, in order to maybe be good at women’s sport. I mean even if that person were guaranteed that they’d win, the win would still come with the major asterisk you and others would affix on the victory. To have this conversation, everyone must accept that no one is suffering the slings and arrows of transition to win a prize others would contest. 

I’m sorry that your friend lost, but she lost to three women. That trans woman who also lost was matched competitively by the other women who ran. It’s not like 3rd and 1st had some greater, even less fair advantage over your friend or the trans woman in question. It seems unreasonable to single out one person who didn’t even win because of who she used to be. Maybe one person had access to better training facilities or another had been running competitively since they could toddle. Those are advantages that may make a competitive difference, but it’s not like you’d single those out as problematic.",1585699221

Bunch of brilliant friends there and they are all so laid back and helpful and some very knowledgable of the game. I left because I was moving to the PC platform but to be very honest it was never the same as being part of this one.

Women arent robots or something. Theirs not a cheat code you can put in to get all of them to like you.

I know it seems like that from the outside looking in, but just because a guy has wider appeal doesnt mean EVERYONE loves him.

Talking to women is hard for most people, the only people who it isnt hard for our the people who LEGIT enjoy the process.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You want to attract girls? You really want to attract women?

Cuz their is a secret method. It works very well.

&amp;#x200B;

You ready for the secret? 

Be  a guys whose already taken and isnt trying to cheat on his girlfriend/wife

It turns every girl on.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing gets women wet more than an unavailable man. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's not because of the girls really, its because of how the guy acts.

Guys who are in relationships are the only guys arent trying to kiss a girls ass and trick them into liking them. 

IT's the only time a guy will be really genuine with a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine not giving a fuck at all about what women think.

The fact that you do care, the fact that you are TRYING, makes you look weak, makes you look desperate, makes you look insecure and unsure of yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Women are just normal people. Get some fuckin self respect and stop trying to be a clown who does magic tricks and maybe women will stop treating you like a clown.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like that guy whose always buying gifts for everyone and being super nice because he's desperate for a friend.

"PHP","t5_2qh38","I am not sure I understand what your getting at. For example, what I am working are bindings, its explicit to RayLib, its C code I am writing not PHP. The same thing was done for the person that wrote OpenGL bindings. Now I have helper libraries such as game state management which in no way needs RayLib-PHP and works completely on its own. However, something like an animated sprite that RayLib does not understand, needs hooks into its rendering system. Now I can abstract it, but overall and introduce unneeded complexity, or just have someone extend the class and override the render method. If not, someone is going to go crazy trying to hook in simple concepts like 2d vectors, rectangles, draw calls, etc into a render. Raylib is a game library, not a game engine. There is only a handful of these, SDL, RayLib, XNA, SMFL, Allegro, and maybe one or two more but thats it. Under those is OpenGL, DirectX, Metal and Vulkan. These are not game engines, which is what you then depend on a game library of raw rendering like OpenGL.",1585699222

None of this relieves the stress and anxiety so many of us are feeling from family's health, personal health, or financial health from loss of jobs. 

Bouncing off of financial health, a reduced tuition would be a lifesaver. Why are we paying in full for this semester when we are likely going to lose much of our on campus time to this pandemic? We're not paying for use of classrooms or labs. We're sitting at home and our profs are operating from their homes. ASU is a ghost town. And anyone who bought a parking pass should be reimbursed a percentage of their payment, considering most aren't using it. I'm so thankful I've been biking most days or paying at meters when im forced to drive instead, otherwise I'd be out a few hundred for no reason.

Biggest issue so far is that you have to manually change tools for different tasks - if you are holding a pickaxe you can hit rocks then if you want to chop the tree next to you need to go to toolbar, press axe, equip, then chop tree, basically adds a lot of unnecessary micro, would be a lot smoother if when you press a tree it would just check to see if you have an axe in your inventory and use that.

Also since everything needs to manually confirmed in the toolbar, would be nice to have some sort “action bar” that has fewer slots but is larger (and can be placed where you wish on the screen) you then drag items into it and then if you press there it will equip/eat them without you having to confirm the action, would definitely make things smoother.",1585699224

Because he was your first boyfriend and I assume you are young, you released a lot of hormones that made your reasoning blind for a time and it's not easy waking up, as you did, from the dream the hormones created.

So my advice is: DON'T IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH YOUR THOUGHTS

You are not your thoughts, your thoughts are being created primarily by the hormones right now, but you are stronger as I can see by your post, tell to your thoughts that they are a lie, don't believe them, it's normal, the human brain works like this, it's the more complex thing in this universe, it isn't easy to control.

After several conversations between us, and about a year where I didn't visit, I go there one day and she's all of a sudden into Celtic paganism...books on druidry and nature worship everywhere. While she didn't go all the way to atheism, she definitely went far enough to upset her VERY religious family...which tickled my petty bone to the marrow. 

Her father does NOT like me, especially after he found out I played some role in his daughter becoming a heathen. 

I told her I'm taking full credit, and wearing it like a badge of honor, cuz there's not much I enjoy more than ruffling feathers of fundamentalist evangelicals.

"CenturyOfBlood","t5_233se6","“Gods, I am sick of this damned dust! You would think that after going on about being the *oldest House in Westeros* they could have smoothed the passage,” Sylvia spat venomously as she wrangled her steed along the ochre trail that was little more than a winding staircase of packed earth leading up into the mountains from the base of the Torrentine. 

“You did not have to come with me, Syl,” Lucifer said, not taking his eyes off his destination on the horizon. He could see the castle built upon a rise at the foot of the greater Red Mountains. High Hermitage. *My new home…* “Ulrick, Deizel, keep up now. These passages can be dangerous for the unweary.” 

He heard two audible sighs, but pushed them from his mind. He understood their disappointment. But it was a childish one, without regard for what needed to be done. In time, they would come to accept it. In time. 

He gripped the reigns of his own horse tighter. He had not lived beyond the walls of Starfall. True, he had travelled and fought for Dorne, but always at the side of Guyard or Sam. He was a blade to be directed where his late father and brothers wished it. Ruling...No. He was not born for this. How could he command a castle he knew nothing of? People he knew only as soldiers. 

There were no answers to be found in the sun, and so the new Knight of High Hermitage rode in silence. 

*** 

“You believe me, don’t you Ulrick?” Aunt Sylvia said with a bright smile. Ulrick blushed. He hated when she did that. She always made fun of him, poking him about his father and his cousins back in Starfall. 

“I-I suppose,” he replied and her smile widened as she rode closer to brush his face with her hand. “Don’t do that!” 

Aunt Sylvia laughed. “Why? You are my darling nephew! You deserve praise for seeing the errors of your fool uncles in Starfall. That idiot Guyard isn’t fit to wield our ancient birthright.”

“Well...I-I did not say that, I just think...Well, High Hermitage is far away in the middle of nowhere. How am I to become a great knight?” Ulrick stammered. *He* would never say that to uncle Guyard. 

But Aunt Sylvia scoffed. “See dear, they don’t *want* you to become a great knight. They have sent your poor father off to deal with problems they don’t want to. They should have given it to Guyard! He was the one who abandoned his family. But they fawn over him like puppies. Your poor father who loves him so thrown to the vultures.” 

Ulrick hunched down in his saddle. He did not know what to believe. His father said they were doing what any good knight should, but Aunt Sylvia was right. They treated father like an outcast… Could it be that his uncles hated them? 

There were no answers in the sun, so with another sigh, Ulrick hunkered down and rode in silence.",1585699227

The difference between 10 AC and 17 AC is literally double damage against +3 to hit, so you're still coming out well behind the barbarian unless you get multiple life force dumps per fight. You're also spending bonus actions to get it, instead of having it always on passively. It's also a resource, so you're either losing out on your class features or you're taking multiple d12s of ""damage"" every time you use a class feature. Guess maybe there's more to balance than meets the eye.

AC doesn't change very few, it's absolutely huge. Bounded accuracy is not intuitive and unless you've sat down to do the math you don't really know what you're talking about. I think it's clear you haven't.",1585699228

Western media published a series of articles about hiding true numbers but all of them cited an untrustful person with a fictional organization ""alliance of doctors"" who just speculated and you all just believed it because we have bad reputation. There definitely was a spike of seasonal pneumonia but it wasn't that abnormal because it's incorrect to make conclusions comparing 2 years in a row to each other according to scientists. I can't know if numbers real or not (probably not because testing still is not wide, but it gets better with every day) but the doubts about them have mostly foreigners like you, not Russians at this point.

The point is that all of these services are overburdened right now, because of this global pandemic and health crisis which is extreme extenuating circumstances. Everything is worse and harder right now. So we have to be more strict on everyone, including the idiots, to lessen that burden. We don’t want families getting sick because the system can’t handle it, we don’t want newly unemployed roaming the streets or trying drugs. It’s a complicated situation.

Masha'Allah! May Allah reward you for this.

Narrated Abu Hurairah: That the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ""Whoever relieves a Muslim of a  burden from the burdens of the world, Allah will relieve him of a burden from the burdens of the Hereafter. And whoever covers (the faults of) a  Muslim, Allah will cover (his faults) for him in the world and the Hereafter. And Allah is engaged in helping the worshiper as long as the  worshiper is engaged in helping his brother.""

At-Tirmidhi 1425 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The wisdom, logic and fairness of Islam made me feel like I'm so lucky that Allah chose me to be Muslim. 

Tbh, I cannot even imagine a second or a moment without Islam. When I see non-Muslims around me, it realizes me that, this blessing of Imaan, Allah has blessed us from the womb of our mother without even asking for it. I cannot be grateful for this even if I spend my all life in prostration. Alhamdulillah

 كُنۡتُمۡ خَيۡرَ اُمَّةٍ اُخۡرِجَتۡ لِلنَّاسِ تَاۡمُرُوۡنَ بِالۡمَعۡرُوۡفِ  وَتَنۡهَوۡنَ عَنِ الۡمُنۡكَرِ وَتُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ بِاللّٰهِ 

You are the best nation produced for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah.

(Al-Imran - 110)

May Allah guide us to the straight path, upon whom He has bestowed favor, and make us among the grateful.",1585699230

That's simple for me. You're trying to unsuccessfully use and cling to the extremes like, ""white supremacy"", and ""racial animosity"". I don't play those games, because it's quite frankly stupid, imo, when he was dropping bombs and drone strikes on innocents around the world.

You are exactly the ""extreme"" you talked about in your previous post. Also, you seem to have no comprehension outside of, ""Democrat is good. Republican is bad."" That's how dumb they have turned the majority of voters on both sides.

Take a nice look in the mirror, and you will see the ""extreme"" you talk about. Literally, trying to justify drone strikes on innocent civilians around the world, by ignoring them, and not thinking that is sick, disgusting, and extreme? Please tell me what I don't comprehend, extremist.

I asked you, would you ever vote for a Republican? It's an easy question.
I would. But those numbers are so few, I can can them on 2 fingers. Same with the number of Democrats I would vote for.

Principles over parties. Ethics over extremes.

President Obama was a horrible president. I hope you wake up and realize that, but at least you will wake up, right, and not have to worry with the drones killing your family ""by accident""? I guess drones aren't really noisy though, until that last split second of horror and nightmare they unleash....",1585699231

Don’t want to start a thread for this so I am going to ask it here and I hope that is okay. 

With the fact that FF7R is going to be in parts and I have been made clear (a bit aggressively) that it is still very much a full game even though the section that it covers was like a 5 hour part of the original. Does this mean that the story has changed a lot and is not going to be the exact same as the original? 

With the PS5 coming out soon, will SE still make the other parts for PS4?

And if this does play out like the 13 series I am hoping that the end will not have any form of a cliffhanger and that it has a solid ending for that part. 

I guess what has me worried and a lot of other people is the fact that we know already that these are going to be in parts and the entire story is released all at once. I am very much interested in buying the remake I just don’t want to be left with an empty feeling after I finish it and knowing that it is going to be a couple years before we get another part.

"trackandfield","t5_2ry5t","Sprinting fast briefly and having a short recovery will get your ability to sprint fast for longer to improve.  

If you follow this little plan for a couple months, you'll get faster and be able to sprint fast for longer.

Monday: short sprints up a hill.  10x20m with 2 minutes between sprints of just standing recovery.

Wednesday: short sprints on flat ground.  10x20m with 2 minutes between sprints of just standing recovery. Each week add 5 meters in length to the sprints, but eliminate however many reps you have to to keep the volume from being any more than 300m total.  

Friday: short speed endurance workout.  35m (or 40 yard) sprints, until the speed drops off.  If you have someone to time every rep you do, you can go until there's a 5% dropoff in time (example: if you did it in 5.00 seconds the first time, you go until you run one that's slower than 5.25 seconds.) If you don't have someone to time you, do 10-12 reps the first time, and each week add 2-3 reps, depending on how you feel.  I've had sprinters do 30-40 reps of this workout after they've done it a few times while maintaining quality.",1585699233

One thing I forgot to mention, he also tried to kill himself which shows that he pretty much wanted to confess or die at that point too. I mean when he tried to kill himself I was really sure that this guy genuinely want to repent and feels deep remorse for what he did in rage and drunkenness. 

And again, rotting in prison for drunken voluntary(or even involuntary) manslaughter is still harsh to be honest... 

I watched how he reacted the moment marina started bleeding and it shows that he really didn't want to kill her which means it is obviously not a cold blooded murder at all or even a malicious one.

Of course when we consider he was drunk, taking pills and had panic attacks with anger issues. Not only that, he was also a minor

It almost seems impossible that judges would sentence him for life imprisonment and life imprisonment without parole is just impossible considering all the above facts. 

It would be considered voluntary or even involuntary(considering his drunk state) manslaughter if he directly confessed to the police when carla didn't tell him to stop.

Which means it is highly likely that he would have gotten out within 10 or 15 years and much less if he showed good behavior in prison anyways.",1585699234

"ReasonableFantasy","t5_3i7g8","Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game (one of the grandfathers of the medium). The company currently running it, Wizards of the Coast, has put quite a bit of effort into making a coherent background story for the sets of cards - previously they did that through weekly short stories on their website and other media, nowerdays they want to mostly do it through e-books.

To sum up: in the world of MTG, there are many ""planes"" - each of them basically a parallel dimension with their own flavour of fantasy. They have a few things in common, most importantly: there are always the five colours of mana and there are very, very rare people that have a ""spark"" that, should it become activated, allows them to travel between those planes. 

Linden is the Queen of Eldraine and reigns together with her husband, Kenrith. The plane is heavily inspired by European folk tales: castles, knights, fairies, witches, basically a big twist on Brother Grimm themes. On Eldraine, the five knightly courts (aligned to the five colours of mana) keep the magical beasts of the Wilds at bay and protect the people of the Realm.

 The story of the set is that a planeswalker called Oko, a chaotic sort-of-anarchist, kidnaps the High King Kenrith, ends up transforming him into a stag and plans to rile up the elves living in the woods against the knightly courts. Kenrith's children, the twins Will and Rowan, try to find and save him.",1585699234

That said, if you don’t need it in your hand, a RTLSDR is about the same price and let’s you do more. I have both. I normally use my Airspy which lets me view the whole 2m band at once and decode DSTAR, YSF and DMR which my Baofeng won’t. The Baofeng is if I want to talk back to the repeater or if the power is out. Good for fire dispatch and NOAA weather radio listening. 

If you get a Baofeng, I’d say get a ham license after this crazy time is over. It’s not hard.",1585699235

I’m incredibly close to my grandfather, who raised me and now lives in a foreign country. Today is his birthday, so obviously everyone has been calling him.

I haven’t been able to get much sleep lately as I still have a heavy workload from remote classes and my in-semester internship still wants me to clock in remotely. I had to stay up later than usual and wake up early, so for the first time this year I took a nap at around 6. 

My mom woke me up an hour later urging me to hop on a family zoom video call with 20+ people, many of whom I haven’t seen in years, to wish my grandfather a happy birthday. I looked like shit because I’d just woken up and because I haven’t had to show my face to anyone for weeks. So I’m groggy, no makeup, dressed like a mess. I honestly just don’t feel comfortable enough with some of my distant family to let them see me like that. So I told my mom that I would do a private call with him later.

Now she is pissed with me. Rather than telling my family the truth, my mom told them I was in the bathroom (for an hour+ I guess) and I now look like an asshole who just didn’t want to see them at all. I want to know honestly though- AITA?

You want estimates based on very small sample sizes? I keep track of every pack I open for every set and how many epics and legendaries I open for each. I've opened around 300 packs for each of the last 3 expansions (to be precise, 262, 339 and 294, completely F2P by the way) and I had easily enough to craft the whole set (which I didn't, I don't need cards that I will never play and so I have nearly 100k dust lying around now).

So in my very limited sample, 300 was enough, and now it will be less, because of the no duplicate rule. How much less is actually difficult to figure out (the maths are complex and some variables are missing).",1585699235

I would have cut him some slack if he came off bitter or petty at times since being in lock down can take its toll on even the most mentally stable and sane among us... but it seems like he might be coming out of this whole ordeal with even more wisdom and serenity! He's still able to put me at ease when I listen to him talk and it's even better when I can watch him as well - I just felt calm and relaxed. :)

He's always dropping these gems or nuggets of wisdom and does it so effortlessly.

I'm someone who can get easily distracted or lose focus by just about anything, but the fact that the dogs were barking up a storm at various times throughout and he didn't seem bothered or irritated at all or lose his train of thought is remarkable to me.

[Nota Original](https://www.publimetro.com.mx/mx/destacado-tv/2020/03/31/la-violencia-nunca-descansa-atracan-taxista-ecatepec.html) | Reducido en un 24.27% | martes 31 de marzo de 2020, a las 14:12

*****

&gt; Un taxista fue víctima de robo de pertenencias por al menos dos sujetos, el pasado viernes 27 de marzo alrededor de las 22:00 hrs en Ecatepec, Estado de México.   

&gt; El atraco captado por la cámara de seguridad del vehículo, muestra la cara de uno de los supuestos agresores, quien con arma en mano apunta hacia al conductor.   

&gt; ""Compartan por favor hasta dar con este delincuente pues ya desapareció se están haciendo rondines y el ‘joven’ ya no aparece, tampoco nos contesta el celular""   El segundo hurtador se encuentra del otro del conductor, por fuera del vehículo.

&gt; El teléfono del taxista también fue robado, los sujetos tuvieron hasta tiempo para pedirle que quitara la huella de su celular para llevárselo desbloqueado.   

&gt; Por otro lado, tal parece que a través de las redes sociales ""identificaron"" a uno de ellos, sin embargo, la presunta víctima grabó una declaración para pedir que no se confundan, que él no hizo nada y ni siquiera tiene tatuajes.

Porn addiction is real, and to some degree, I experience the very symptoms you describe.

However, have you considered the possibility that you might be depressed? The sudden social withdrawal, especially how you noticed your friends seem to be treating you different is a common symptom jumps out to me. It seems highly unlikely that you're loyal friends would randomly start treating you differently (and if they did they suck as friends), it seems more likely your *interpretation* has changed. 

As a pre-med you undoubtedly had to take some opening psych courses, and in mine, we learned that in a depressed state of mind many people interpret neutral, or even positive, facial expressions as negative. Effectively, the depressed person thinks that every interaction is more negative than it really was, and this deepens their isolation and consequently, worsens the depression. 

Regardless, if this may be true. I wish you the best on continuing your journey and hope you feel better soon.

* Read through the section once without taking any notes
* On the second read-through, take notes. I recommend *not* taking notes directly in the book; using a notebook or pages in a binder will give you a good resource tailor-made for you, to use when you're studying
*  When it comes to example problems, read the question, then cover up the printed solution.
   * Work it out on your own. Refer to the text and your notes for help
   * Only look at the printed solution when you have finished. *Do not give in to feeling ""helplessly lost.""* Come up with some sort of solution before looking at the correct solution
   * Analyze what you did right, what you did wrong, why the right parts are right, and why the wrong parts are wrong.

&gt;La investigadora del Conicet consideró que uno de los mayores problemas del Gobierno es querer centralizar los testeos.

Solo se centralizan los resultados (como en cualquier país del mundo para definir estaremos unificada) a través del sistema informático SIVILA, casa gobierno e institución tiene libertad para publicar sus propios datos.

&gt;**De hecho también están controlando la distribución de respiradores.**  

Porque como diferentes regiones del país tienen diferentes cantidad de recursos y diferentes cantidad de recursos. Es necesario el traslado y distribución de los recursos, por ejemplo se comprobó en Italia que gente moría sin acceso a respiradores en el sur, mientras había camas libres en el norte. Se adoptó un sistema de traslado entre instituciones para solucionar esto, y de traslado de equipos en forma móvil.


&gt;""No podemos estar unificando todo en el Malbrán. Eso redunda en menor eficiencia. 

&gt;Pitta, quien [tuvo una amplia repercusión mediática el año pasado](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/sandra-pitta-cientifica-cruzo-alberto-fernandez-son-nid2273242) al protagonizar un entredicho con el entonces candidato Alberto Fernández.

Y no la iban a estar entrevistando por su conocimiento en salud pública, manejo de respiradores, o entendimiento de epidemiológia.

&gt;Al referirse a los testeos que se están realizando en el país, la investigadora 

Quien no investiga en nada relacionado directo con la salud.

&gt;argumentó que ""lo que hicieron la mayoría de los países es aumentarlos""

En base a una estrategia y un protocolo. Usabamos hasta el viernes el mismo protocolo que el resto de los países de Latinoamérica. Solo tuvimos menor cantidad de destinatarios para el estudio. Probablemente por la restricción al ingreso al país.

&gt;Y en ese sentido, agregó con preocupación: ""Acá ya tenemos transmisión comunitaria.

Razón por la cual desde que se comprobó con la estrategia anterior la círculacion, se inició en dichas zonas un estrategia de testeo intensivo focalizado. De manera de obtener en ellas una densidad de tests similar a la de países como Alemania con el objetivo de lograr contención y a la vez ahorrar recursos.
(No sé pide más criterio de viaje, solo fiebre y dolor de garganta). ¿Tampoco se enteró?

&gt; La sensación es que tratan de aplanar la curva a fuerza de no tener números y de dar números que no son comparables con otras partes del mundo"".

Es demasiado temprano para hablar de la curva porque recién se empieza a dibujar. Justamente cuando va a empezar a subir radicalemente, es cuando estamos empezando a testear intensivamente. ¿Tampoco se enteró?

&gt; Después se iban a habilitar 35 laboratorios más públicos. Parece que acá lo importante es que sean públicos"", dijo Pitta.

Ya están habilitados. ¿De nuevo sigue sin enterarse?

&gt;""Sin datos no se pueden tomar decisiones y en este momento no los tenemos y perdimos un tiempo valioso.

Tenemos operando 20 unidades centinelas en el país, que testean a toda persona que les llega + se testea a todo personal de salud que presente síntomas + a toda neumonía + a todo caso severo. ¿Si no como sabe ella que hay círculacion comunitaria?

&gt;En muchas partes del mundo están aunando los esfuerzos privados y públicos, no hay una división entre uno y otros"".

It makes sense though because I was about 500 hours in when I first took damage. I was doing a blindfolded delirium run when my house was stuck by a sudden flood. It literally ripped my house apart but luckily I was playing on one of those inflatable chairs which I floated on while finishing off delirium with one hand. But right before I was about to finish the run, I realized the water was taking me directly into the side of a bridge that would have killed me on impact because I was going so fast. So at literally the last second I jumped with my laptop in hand and did a forward flip just barely clearing the top of the bridge before landing back down on my feet on the road. I took off my blindfold to see an amazed crowd just staring at me in silence. Then I just looked at them with a grin and said, ""It's just another day playing Isaac"". The crowd erupted into applause and hoisted me up in the air while chanting my name. The mayor was there and said it was the most amazing thing he had ever seen and asked for my autograph. Then a man approached me and asked me to marry his daughter who was a super model athlete billionaire and I said no cuz I get chicks on the reg who are way hotter than her. All in all it was a pretty average day for me and I'm surprised I even remember it. I'm not trying to brag or anything.

Just a simple counter example could be to suggest that the force Jupiter exerts on earth is far greater than it would exert on a an asteroid.
Use your physics 1 force between two bodies equations.

F1= force between earth and Jupiter 
F2= force between asteroid and Jupiter

I won’t go into the complexities but to help your belief I erred the unknowns like asteroid mass highly in your favor @ 0.1*10^15 Kgs I did the same with distance to show how vastly different it is.

F1 = 2.19e^18
F2 = 3.18e^12

That’s a difference in force of 10^5 multiples in  Newtons. That’s 100,000 times more force exerted on Earth than the asteroid. Then you have to look at the counter forces pulling in the other direction like the sun. But really this is why it’s easier to just see current trajectory when it becomes visible long after Jupiters influence. Which means if NASA has a trajectory and distance from the planet it’s far from anything else affecting trajectory. Especially this time where it passes us before passing Mars.

If all coroners did was scoop up burn victims and people who fell off of buildings, there wouldn't be coroners. These are rare cases and people can cope with them, but there isn't a coroner I've met - and I used to be one - who actually enjoys that part of the job. I've seen partly decomposed bodies fished out of creeks with hooks, bodies that burned in car wrecks, kids that suffocated in cribs, suicides by hanging and gunshot, junkies who weren't discovered for two weeks, and let me tell you that those things are gnarly. I think I handle those things better than most people, but I could not do that every day. Most people we dealt with were in reasonably intact shape and had been worked on by paramedics or doctors before I was called in. 

I know some things. I have seen some things. I have touched, smelt and reassembled some things for transport. I've taken pictures. I've spoken to next of kin. I've sat through their autopsies.

"HomeNetworking","t5_2s4pd","Do you actually have client devices that have not only MU-MIMO support but WORKING MU-MIMO support?  Because unless your clients have functioning MU-MIMO it doesn't help any if your router does and can sometimes make things worse.  Very few client devices have working MU-MIMO.

If you want to actually increase your WiFi bandwidth for multiple clients either get a tri-band router or better multiple APs to share the load.  Two AC1200 class APs will provide far more real world WiFi bandwidth then a single AC2600 router with MU-MIMO while likely costing less.

If you want a stable router with advanced features then get one that does what you want out of the box.  Stop hacking home class routers and hoping everything works properly.  Ubiquiti, Mikrotik, pfSense, etc all have good options that are stable and won't break the bank.",1585699238

PaintGem also has a few on their site you can pick from since they allow you to pick the size. However, it does cost more depending on the size you pick, and it does ship from China too.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

""Slavery in Canada includes both that practised by First Nations from earliest times and that under European colonization. While Britain did not ban slavery in present-day Canada until 1833, the practice of slavery was ended through case law; and it died out in the early 19th century through judicial actions litigated on behalf of slaves seeking manumission. The courts, to varying degrees, rendered slavery unenforceable in both Lower Canada and Nova Scotia. In Lower Canada, for example, after court decisions in the late 1790s, the ""slave could not be compelled to serve longer than he would, and... might leave his master at will."" A significant number of black people came to Canada from the United States after the American Revolution and again after the War of 1812.""",1585699239

I’m not completely innocent either, both our parents abused us so I was troublesome, but in different ways. 

Whenever you believe something good about yourself put it in your art, music, something important to you to remind you that it is true. Your family lies to you because they want you under their control. When they put you down, tell yourself they are lying and unfortunately can’t see you honestly. My guess is, a lot of people believe in you. Your professors, as you seem like a determined and diligent student, your middle sister who has your back, and us here, you sound like a patient and focused person which are awesome qualities to have! 

Keep going, you sound like you’re going to do great in the world and spread kindness. Maybe look into therapy when campus’s open again or look for a counseling service that’s over the phone or texting services. It should help combat the lies they’ve been telling you. It’s helped me.",1585699239

I´m just guessing here but i think the belief systems shoudn´t be that vastly different since it´s not really a believing thing but about logic an how those ""beliefs"" aligns with what we know of reality, not to what we don´t know and assume it´s a magical thing that ""proves"" whatever we want to believe.

John Ehrlichman, who partnered with Fox News cofounder Roger Ailes on the Republicans' ""Southern Strategy"":

&gt;[We] had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying?

&gt;We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

&gt;We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

&gt;Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

&gt;""He was the premier guy in the business,"" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. ""He was our Michelangelo.""

&gt;Ailes repackaged Richard Nixon for television in 1968, papered over Ronald Reagan’s budding Alzheimer’s in 1984, shamelessly stoked racial fears to elect George H.W. Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993.

&gt;Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting “real people affected by taxes.”

&gt;**Palmer Luckey: The Facebook Near-Billionaire Secretly Funding Trump’s Meme Machine**

&gt;“We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.

&gt;“I’ve got plenty of money,” Luckey added. “Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.”

&gt;“I came into touch with them over Facebook,” Luckey said of the band of trolls behind the operation. “It went along the lines of ‘hey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff.’”

Another Facebook billionaire working on this:

&gt;Thiel has become a national figure of controversy for, among other things, claiming that “the extension of the franchise to women **[women's right to vote] render the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,”** saying, **“I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,”** funding a fellowship that specifically tries to get undergraduates to drop out of college, and donating $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s campaign a week **after** a tape was released in which the then-candidate discussed how he could grope young female actresses and get away with it.

&gt;Thiel was long perceived as a libertarian, but in recent years, as his support for Trump illustrates, his politics have taken a nationalist flavor that critics have described as bordering on authoritarian and white nationalist.

&gt;In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged **date rapes were “seductions that are later regretted,”** ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel’s home, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that “sometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.”

https://stanfordpolitics.org/2017/11/27/peter-thiel-cover-story/

&gt;Rabois came to Thiel's attention after he was found outside an instructor's home, shouting homophobic slurs and the suggestion that the instructor ""die of AIDS."" [10][11][12] A few of the contributors went on to join PayPal, a company Thiel co-founded in 1998. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Rabois

Despite claiming to care about free speech on college campuses, Thiel [doesn't like people learning on college campuses and pays them to drop out](https://stanfordpolitics.org/2017/11/27/peter-thiel-cover-story/) and [bankrolled lawsuits against journalists because they reported on Thiel being gay](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/28/gawker-hulk-hogan-silicon-valley-privacy-peter-thiel)

&gt;**How key Republicans inside Facebook are shifting its politics to the right**

&gt;**amid fears it could be broken up if a Democrat wins in 2020**

&gt;“Facebook’s DC office ensures that the company’s content policies meet the approval of Republicans in Congress,” Popular Information said.

&gt;Joel Kaplan [[key participant of the Florida recount Brooks Brothers riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot)], vice-president of global public policy at Facebook, manages the company’s relationships with policymakers around the world. A former law clerk to archconservative justice Antonin Scalia on the supreme court, he served as deputy chief of staff for policy under former president George W Bush from 2006 to 2009, joining Facebook two years later.

&gt;Kaplan has reportedly advocated for rightwing sites such as Breitbart and the Daily Caller, which earlier this year **became a partner in Facebook’s factchecking program**. Founded by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, the Daily Caller is pro-Trump, anti-immigrant and widely criticised for the way it reported on a fake nude photo of the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

&gt;**Warren noted this week: “Since he was hired, Facebook spent over $71 million on lobbying—nearly 100 times what it had spent before Kaplan joined.” She added: “Facebook is now spending millions on lobbying amid antitrust scrutiny—and Kaplan is flexing his DC rolodex to help Mark Zuckerbeg [sic] wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.”**

&gt;Katie Harbath, **the company’s public policy director for global elections, led digital strategy for Rudy Giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee.**

&gt;Facebook’s Washington headquarters also includes Kevin Martin, vice-president of US public policy and former chairman, under Bush, of the Federal Communications Commission

&gt;Warren’s ascent in the polls has set off alarm bells at Facebook. In a leaked audio recording last month, Zuckerberg could be heard telling employees: “But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.”

&gt;Zuckerberg “has to be worried about what happens to Facebook if there’s a Democratic president”

"NorthCarolina","t5_2qhmx","hi! the comments above cover it pretty well, I would just emphasize that there's a wide spectrum, particularly between rural and urban areas. dialect does vary, there's phrases and things that you'd hear in the mountains but not toward the coast. people in the more rural areas tend to have what you'd call a stronger accent i suppose. and we can have some fairly strong opinions on the ""right"" way to say things, or maybe that's just my family lol. 

we're very much in the Bible belt, so there's a ton of churches of various Christian denominations. that and being proud of southern heritage is big - kind of an odd detail, but there's a lot of shirts reflecting that as well. we have a lot of small towns - like, one or two stop lights small towns, we name our intersections, that kind of thing.

there's a lot a LOT of farmland (tobacco used to be the main thing, but they're moving away from that), and hog farms in the east.

it's a pretty friendly atmosphere most of the time - very much the wave at the person walking down the road or in their yard when you drive by, that kind of thing. 

like they said, cheerwine and nc barbecue (vinegar based) is big and the other kinds of barbecue are just wrong, and Bojangles and Cookout are big fast food chains. pig pickins are common - my brother is actually doing that for his wedding reception, and that's pretty normal.

college basketball is particularly big, the main ones being UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, NC State, and Wake Forest. the rivalries can get tense, esp when UNC is involved. 

theres a lot of history with native Americans, colonization. the lost colony of Roanoke was here. pirates, ghost stories, all that.

we have a history of moonshining, and I just learned that Nascar was not only born here, but started from moonshining. 

I know some of that wasn't specifically asked for, but I know the kind of weird questions or little things I want to know when I'm writing so I figured I'd put my two cents in. I'd be happy to answer any more questions, as would any of the other commenters I'm sure! hope it helps!",1585699240

"coolguides","t5_310rm","It helps if you think of electricity as water flowing from one container to another through a hose, except in the case of electrical circuits, it is electrons flowing and not water. Imagine that one container is filled with water and pressurized and the other one is held in a vacuum/ negative pressure. Then imagine that the two containers are connected and the water is allowed to flow.

Using that analogy, the difference in pressure between the two containers would be similar to voltage (the force causing the water to flow from the positively pressurized container to the negatively pressurized one  through the hose.) 

When water flows through a hose you can measure the amount of water flowing through it in gallons per minute or liters per minute. Similarly, you can measure the flow of electrons through a wire at a given moment which is measured in amps ( aka, current or intensity).

Since the hose is very narrow compared to the amount of water in the container, it introduces a restriction to the flow of water between the two containers. Electrons flowing through a wire will experience some resistance as well, depending on the size and the material the wire is made of. This resistance is measured in ohms. Copper provides very little resistance to electron flow which is why it is so often used as wiring in homes and cars.",1585699241

&gt;If you get sick it’s your responsibility to keep the virus to yourself. I’d rather leave it in an individuals hands to handle it themselves than have the collective force them into isolation.

Right, but can you not understand that based on the balance of probabilities, out of the billions of peopelt that live on the planet there will be those who are just idiots and spread the virus, or those who spread the virus because ""it's a prank bro"" or those who do it maliciously on purpose, etc. Those people should be prevented from doing so because it keeps others (who don't deserve to die) safe from the virus.


&gt;And because people are sick healthy people have to remain indoors as well?

Well that's the thing, since we can't tell who's sick and who's healthy, everyone should assume they aren't healthy to avoid spreading the disease.


&gt;Is it truly a free society if an individual doesn’t have a decision?

I'm not allowed to go outside and shoot someone in the face. I think if I go outside and get someone sick and they die (when I could have easily stayed indoors), while not as bad it is still me causing their death.


&gt; Or does the collective choice matter more than the individuals personal liberty?

It's not collective choice, it's collective safety. Imagine we had someone who had a disease that had a 90% chance of killing you if you caught it. Would you be perfectly fine to possibly just run into that person as you go about your day and have a 90% chance to die? Or would you say that person should not be allowed to go outside and possibly kill you?",1585699242

He started off with a 1.3 trillion dollar deficit from bush, attached the 252 billion for more stimulus and then ended it with 660 billion his lame duck session. I’d say that he did as best as he could despite all the outrage Fox News propaganda put out for his presidency. Had he continued he may have continually ran the deficit down.

"antipornography","t5_38sep","Yeah it's disgusting how porn companies knowingly expose children to such highly addictive, twisted shite.

It's disturbing that so few people care about the effects porn has on children. I fear for the coming generations, COCSA increases are thought to be due to porn use. Younger first exposure to porn in boys leads to increased levels of desire to control women in later life.

 Girls are expecting sex to be painful, scary, violent; boys are expecting girls to submit to awful, degrading treatment because mainstream porn is so extreme nowadays.

The UK proposed measures to make it harder for kids to access porn but of course all the pornsick brickheads called it a ""PORN BAN!!!"" And therefore a crime against humanity 🙄",1585699243

"lego","t5_2qhm7","As part of the city plan I'm working on with my son, the firehouse remodel (60110) is underway. This is part of the long list of existing buildings that I need to plan and redo.

While I'm doing the major buildings, my son is building vehicles and small models like the Donut Stand. He's 5 so he can't handle bigger builds likes this but I'm enjoying the bonding experience and watching him learn and grow!!!!!

About this building:

\- My son has a larger fire engine from 60110 and also another medium sized engine 60107-1 so I made matching garage bays opposed to the smaller one found in the original set.

\- The ground floor will be an office area with a dispatcher. 

\- The second floor will be expand out over the garage and will feature the living quarters an office for the fire chief, a bathroom with showers and possibly an equipment storage area.

\- The garage area will have a small mechanic area with some tools.  


I was going to use the turnstyle doors from 60110 but I felt it looked too much like an office building with them. I'll likely use those parts for another moc.  


  
I'm also not adhering to the typical modular rules (white lamp posts, space from the edge...this building will but up against a road so I wanted the space from the garage to the road baseplate to be minimal so that the engines pull right out into the road and head to the fire. The sidewallk will be built into the road baseplate.

True power, as we understand it, comes from order and coordination, where the myriad components of complex systems work together to fire a bullet, move a car, or elect a leader. Chaos breaks working systems into their components, rendering them dysfunctional and less than the sum of their parts.

The strength of Chaos isn't in the powers they themselves manifest outright, but in their ability to corrupt and mangle what rely upon and take for granted. Chaos feeds on order like parasites on animals, and turns it to its own ends like milk into cheese. It doesn't need to win in a straight fight if it can simply conscript the opposing army to its own ends.

Press BACK and WRITE/NEXT simultaneously on the TD-3 to select the external input; press the D key on the TD-3 (labeled MIDI) if you're using a MIDI cable, or the E key (labeled USB) if you are using USB.

Go to Preferences -&gt; Link/MIDI in Ableton; turn Sync on for Output: TD-3, but leave Track off. Select the pattern that you wish to play. Press Start/Stop on the TD-3 so that it is lit; you won't hear anything until you press Play on Ableton. Finally, press Play on Ableton.",1585699244

We have heard the criticism that our previous automoderator comment bot was annoying, cumbersome, and overly long.

For that we would like to sincerely apologize to all who were impacted by the hardships of bloated comment sections and threads that were difficult to parse though.

That being said, we want to also take this time to recognize that many feel that giving special privileges to black people, people of color, and white allies on a subreddit devoted to black people and black culture is harmful and bigoted.

In response, we do want to take this time to ensure that /r/BlackPeopleTwitter is an inclusive environment for all participants, particularly the much-oppressed group of straight white male Redditors. 

With the recent closures of spaces such as /r/GamersRiseUp and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, many of these oppressed Redditors are currently lost and without a home on this website.

In order to make these Redditors feel more welcome on /r/BlackPeopleTwitter, we want to sincerely recognize the added value of these voices on this subreddit.

To do so, we encourage you to search out comments by these Redditors and upvote them. To find the best of these voices, we suggest that you sort this post’s comment section by controversial and look for comments that have been automatically collapsed by Reddit’s Crowd Control feature.  If you think it is a particularly worthy comment, please hit the ""report"" button to bring it to moderator attention.

**Note, if you have black privilege, or if you are a person of color or ally, and have no need for this increased visibility, please click here and follow these instructions: https://redd.it/bfqeee.**

In addition to this effort to raise up the voices of these oppressed people, we have also opened new moderator applications strictly for those who are melanin deprived.

You can submit your application using the following google form link to apply: https://forms.gle/4zYpF1UhCJju91Wb8

For more information about /r/BlackPeopleTwitter's work to encourage diversity on this subreddit, see here: https://redd.it/frql0r.

In the meantime, we at /r/BlackPeopleTwitter will continue fighting on behalf of those who desire to have raisins in their potato salad.

Thank you for your time and have a nice day.

In addition, the population effectiveness of the mask is less than the pure effectiveness of the mask. Because not everyone in the population who wears a mask is going to be exposed to airborne COVID-19.

You have sex, ~100% time there is sperm that needs to be blocked, so even if it's only 20% effective, it's 20% effective on the whole because it's needed 100% of the time. The air does not have COVID in it every time for the general public. But it gets a lot closer to 100% for people working in medical centers.

I wish there was a better middle ground where the CDC could've said ""hey, use homemade masks but not the N95 ones, those are best saved for medical professionals"" but we've seen throughout this crisis that people will ignore the pack in favor of their own self interests.

Is your return. Up to them. Or you.

They want me back as soon as

possible but it's up to me they can't

really do anything. 3/4 of the staff

isn't there

I think if you did return you could

help them implement proper cleaning

procedures therefore keeping

yourself safe. You probably would

have less exposure there than going

to a grocery store. Plus it would help

you solidify your position for perhaps

even further advancement

I found that on the maps that are plain without any trees or water or anything it can be playable, but on most maps it will be too demanding for the iGpu. 
I tested on all minimum with 600x400, 1280x720, 1360x768 which all worked OK (achieved pretty stable mid 30's to high 20's with some micro stutters) on 1280x720 on the plain map but unplayable (5-20 fps) in any other circumstances. 
The main bottleneck is the GPU not handling the scenery. Also found that the CPU could only comfortably handle around 70-80 NPC's  before struggling. 
If you know that you are going to upgrade your PC at some point go ahead, otherwise I would recommend sticking to warband or wait and see if they optimize it even further down the line (although im pretty impressed as it is)

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I'm not lying and maybe you should take the time to educate yourself before talking with such authority on a subject you've somehow became an instant expert on since COVID began.

Contrary to what you're saying COVID doesn't aerosolize except in conditions that will cause specifically (such as a nebulizer treatment or an intubation). We don't just shed raw viruses, that's not how it works. They exit our bodies on vectors an are transmitted on respiratory droplets and that's what determines droplet vs airborne precaution. Again, these are both technical terms, maybe you should have done some self education first. 

Through years of rigorous research and study we have determined how far specific, respiratory droplets can travel, and what diseases travel on droplets of what size. For droplet greater than 5 microns we know the distance they can travel (this is where the 6 feet recommendation comes from). 

This is how droplet precautions (which are a standard set of ppe and a standard industry term) are decided. Surgical/procedural masks and face shields are sufficient to protect from droplet spread infections. There is ZERO evidence to support airborne transmission of COVID in the absence of aerosolizing procedures. Airborne transmission is also a technical term and refers to transmission of disease through particles smaller than 5 microns. These particles can stay afloat in the air for longer periods of time.

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","Yes. In my original response to OP I suggested contacting a women’s shelter and sharing what’s been going on with one trusted individual for now. I told her to act on the advice given by the shelter and to start documenting with the police station that arrested him everything that he’s been doing. 

But I also know how hard it is to leave even from a legal side. My older sister was in an abusive relationship, she went about everything she needed to to get out, got an order of protection and moved out, and filed for divorce (which took two years because Texas and he dragged his feet the entire time - fun fact, they still have the Rule of Thumbs law on the books where it is legal to beat your wife with an object as wide as your thumb). He literally broke into her house, beat her within an inch of her life, and then left. She was in the ICU, had to get reconstructive surgery for her face, and needed occupational therapy due to the number of bones he broke. And all he got was a few nights in jail, had to pay a fine, and got less in the divorce. He’s free now, as far as I know, and my sister had to up-end her life, change her name, and move somewhere else because of that AH. So just be careful with how you word things.

That first week, all the hiking trails and parks were flooded with people. So many parks had to close down because they were attracting 1000x the normal amount of people lol.

There are more people on the neighborhood streets now than I've ever seen, especially during the week. But my lucky pup is having the time of her life.

I'm sorry, but ""why aren't you a professional x photographer???"" is not a valid argument. That's arguing ad hominem and it's a logical fallacy.

And there is more to their advantage than just ""access to animals"". Their money and name recognition gains them access to incredibly talented people that are excited to teach them new things and guide them in cool places. Also the name recognition provides a positive emotional feedback loop. They do things related to their dads legacy, like nature photography, and people from all over praise them and promote them, which gives them positive feelings and motivates them to progress at the trade.

In contrast, had I (for example) started a nature photography blog when I was in high school I likely would have been ridiculed for it. That negative response is demotivating.

You still haven't really defended what this is. Is it a count, is it a percentage rate?

Do you have it for different individuals in each country or only at the country level.


A Heckmann correction model uses an instrumental variable to correct for non random sample selection. However it works best for individual level data where you can observe various aspects of individual behaviour. It's really hard to draw significant conclusions on female labour force participation on cross section data as it is in reality a microeconomic household issue especially as fertility planning, child bearing and child rearing is a lengthy process (but that is just my view as a researcher in family economics!).

"acting","t5_2qyft","As a former BFA Acting student and former SAG-AFTRA member (ie. Changed my mind, like you!) here is some of my insight. 

I went to school, as I said, for acting. In my Sophomore juries, the senior acting professor told me I was so great I would be better off pursuing a degree from a conservatory program or moving back to LA (where I lived outside of school) and straight to master classes and pursuing a career. As you said, with all the opinions about degree v no degree, I went the “straight to career” road and did not finish my degree in anything at all. 
I moved back home, did the master classes, I got the SAG vouchers and the agents, I went on auditions daily. Life went on and yadda yadda, a few years later the worst thing ever happened - I fell in love, got married, and realized that a life of driving around Los Angeles 50 hours a week for a few hours of work was just not what I wanted for myself and this new family I was building. I broke up with my Agent, stopping paying SAG dues, and that was that. Fast forward 9 years and 2 kids later - I miss acting, and actors, and theory, and plays, and ALL OF IT, SO MUCH. But I am still certain that a career of auditioning isn’t what I want. So here I am, a mid-level manager for a major retailer. Yup. Now, had I gotten better advice from that Prof and finished my degree in theater somewhere, ANYWHERE, sure I STILL wouldn’t be pursuing a career as a working actor, but I would probably be living the family life I want while teaching, or doing management, working in a corporate office for a big studio, giving lessons, or getting my Masters degree and teaching at a community college or University. I would still be living actor life but in a different way. SO - all that to say, yes, you ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY DO NOT NEED AN ACTING DEGREE TO BE AN ACTOR, and it’s NORMAL to change your mind - but you DO often need an acting or theater or film degree to pursue a well-paying buttoned-up career in theater, film, or television for the jobs that aren’t grind, grind, grind. At the end of the day, what you have to ask yourself is “if I change my mind about acting itself, will I be fulfilled by an (insert industry) job 40-60 hours a week for the rest of my life?” You might think a theater degree is worthless, but there are a ton of jobs inside and outside the industry that you can still get after you graduate. It’s really about the industry you’re setting yourself up to compete in, not the job title.

Edit: To correct myself - you don’t need a degree in theater/film/acting to pursue a well-paying buttoned-up career in this field, but you do need a degree at least adjacent. Example: Even studio lawyers study film and television law in college.",1585699249

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I've had a question about the 401k withdrawal guidelines but still slightly confused.

The background -

Worked for a company years ago and was able to have a small contribution grow pretty well.

Left company and left the 401k to be taken care of by original insurance company.

Company left insurance company due to a merger so the 401k was rolled into a new insurance company but just sitting now.

Called the current insurance group that holds that 401k (Prudential) and they said that they are still imposing a 10% fee and informed to file the taxes as usual.

They could not give me any details or ETA for their terms to update due to covid19 scares but I understand its a strange time and we're still waiting for answers everywhere.

Now my question, I want to withdraw this amount as it could help me out of some tight spots coming up but would I have to pay this back eventually since it is a 401k still technically? I'd rather not have to deal with it sitting there while I am not actively having the 401k funded or invested in. The sum won't put me in another tax bracket or close so will I have to worry about penalties down the line? At this point the penalties might be my initial investment so I wouldn't even shed a tear.

Sorry its everywhere but I couldn't think of any more info that would help.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I want to pull out a small amount from a 401k account and close it after. Will not bump me into another tax bracket because amount is really small. Will I be penalized down the road or am I somewhat in the clear here?",1585699249

False.

They tried.  Hard, in fact.  There has been massive amounts of *documented* voter suppression.  

Dozens or even hundreds of voting locations were closed with little to no notice on Super Tuesday.  

Young people were waiting in lines for 7+ hours and some of them had to leave to get back to their jobs, or risk being fired.

There's a few near me that help out nonprofits they have various projects for anyone who wants to join. They'll usually have a way to communicate (slack). That might be a good way to meet some local coders and get your hands dirty.

Also, find coders on YouTube. I kind of have a friend who's a mentor for me, but I find the senior programmers on YouTube talking about coding and the state of programming a good motivator. TechLead is fun to watch and I'd recommend talks Uncle Bob has given. I think there's a lot to be gained in being invested in programming as a profession and craft.",1585699249

If you get a touchscreen panel you can still have some nice integrations, just with a bit less smooth a feel.

what you're suggesting is setting up testing for employees as they come in to work, then fining companies that don't do that

furthermore you're going to have to test everyone that interacts with said employees and products (think supermarkets) so people are going to have to get screened before they go in

think airports

think movie theaters

think any restaurant

"Naruto","t5_2quts","Hello! Your submission was removed  from /r/Naruto because it violates the following rule:

You either did not provide a source or the correct source for your art/edit. Even if the post isn't an art post (a question, discussion, etc using fanart as a point of reference), it still needs to be correctly sourced.

Additionally, make sure that: **All Fanart, Fan edits, and Cosplays are linked directly to the artists page in the main post, and NOT in the comments section of the post**

To link directly to the source, **copy-paste the url of the work into the url space that's available when making a link post.** Uploading said work as an image and leaving the link in the comment thread is the incorrect method. 

If the art in question is original content (OC) re-hosting on reddit/imgur etc. is fine.

If the artwork is traced and/or a reference was used, be honest about it. Give credit to the original artist by linking to their work (if it can be found) or leave their name in the comments/title.

The following websites are not valid sources: weheartit.com, pinterest.com, zerochan.net, dailyanimeart.com, alphacoders.com, any website with ""wallpaper"" in it, etc... these are aggregate sites which only have re posted artwork.

The original source is almost always on pixiv.net, deviantart.com, twitter, instagram, tumblr or artstation.

Remember that if you edited someone else's work, you still need to give the original artist credit.

 - No Manga
 - No Hentai
 - No Weeb Culture
 - No Anime Games
 - No Anime Art Style
 - No honorary Anime
  - Examples: Avatar, Castlevania, Code Lyoko, DDLC, ...

 
All memes must now be Cartoon or Comic related:

 - Needs to be made by a western company
 - Needs to use a Cartoon aesthetic
 - Needs to be 2D
 - Relate to cartoons or comic culture

The time of anime is over, cartoons are the future old man!

But if you enjoy musicals and the notebook that doesn't mean you're a woman. If you love to do physical jobs and like to wear your hair short that doesn't make you a man. There's nothing wrong with being more feminine or masculine whatever gender you are. If you start transitioning because you think your personality HAS to match whats between your legs to fit in better in society, that can only end badly. It's much easier to just learn to accept that you're going a bit against the grain compared to your peers, and that's ok. The alternative to that being the monumental task of changing almost every part of your body with surgery and hormones to hopefully look like an average person of the other gender. A good chunk of it don't make it, and it's a tough journey to stop too.

I think transgenderism is a bit the new ADHD. It's definitely valid and psychologically proven, however some people are just wrongly (self)diagnosed. Especially when dealing with people under 20 years old.",1585699253

If things start to spiral though and we begin to lose control then I believe we could fall as low as 4000. We might anyway with the US seemingly losing the fight. 

I don't see how we crawl out of any restrictions/lockdowns until August or September and even then we could be like this for a year perhaps even more. I reckon vaccine will be early next year for frontline workers, healthcare, paramedics etc then public mid next year. 

Then again if an effective treatment gets found/approved then best case we lift lockdowns in 4-6 months. 

Either way it's going to be a very wild ride and I really hope we can get on top of it sooner rather than later.

"composer","t5_2sjib","The absolute best thing for you to do is find piano pieces that have already been orchestrated and study them. ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" is the perennial example. But there are other things arranged for smaller groups.

There's no ""flow chart"".

Honestly, the way you orchestrate is really a ""style"" thing - the way people orchestrated in the Baroque is different from Classical. Most things now are geared towards Orchestrating in what is essentially a Romantic period style still (still...)

There's no ""right or wrong"" way other than it working for the ensemble (so working with live players is critical) and getting the sonic result you want.

This is why it's such a difficult thing to teach and to learn (and why there are so few really good resources online).

What Orchestration books and other resources do is point you towards examples that save you time - so, for example, if you want to compose for Brass, you don't have to dig through 30 symphonies until you find an isolated Brass section where you can really hear how they work. They basically have done that for you.

They also are resources on range, and basics of instruments, but you're not going to ""learn to orchestrate"" from a book or a website.

The absolute best way to learn is to orchestrate something for players you have available.

Too many kids/beginners are trying to ""write for orchestra"" (before they're even close to ready) and they have no clue what it's going to sound like (other than their synthorchestra in a DAW) and they'll never even get it played - you don't learn anything from that.

You've got a Hornist and Oboeist? Well start writing for them and getting first hand (or first ear) feedback from hearing your arrangements and seeing what works and what doesn't. You can even communicate with the players directly and get tips. No sense writing for Orchestra when you're not going to be able to hear and learn from it.

Granted, a DAW can give you some idea, but once you start writing for synthorchestra, you might as well just go by your ear because none of the other stuff really matters.",1585699253

Either someone makes a decision, or we can all sit around pointing figures as to who's job it is to do their job.

 It's sad, and really shows the lack of leadership and personal responsibility towards the American people from those in charge, top down. Unfortunately, the way this works is that it's not ONLY the Presidents responsibility to make decisions, that's called a dictatorship, look it up.

 Even the lowest service member has the right to refuse orders, should they feel they're ineffective and dangerous, you know that right? Sure, it's not a *good idea* to ignore him, but would you sit calmly at work, knowing a coworker will hurt themself, because ""*it's not my jawwwb*"". I ask, because I was in this position last year, and I had no qualms going above everyone, as that person was going to spray a toxic chemical, in an enclosed space, without PPE. That person would most likely not be working anymore had I did what you think is right, sitting around pointing fingers because of cowardice.

When it comes to human brains everything is a massive grey area. Psychological disorders are our attempts at categorizing and quantifying sets of behaviors and feelings that have negative impacts on our lives, and our definitions and criteria for those disorders changes over time. There's no real difference between someone who falls just under the current threshold for a diagnosis and someone who barely qualifies, both could equally benefit from the prescribed treatment for what we call ADHD. The line you're skirting is a (relatively) arbitrary and mutable one, the only thing that matters is that your medication helps you and makes your life better.

Later, in flight school my first flight training would be in the Huey as the TH-55 had been retired and the TH-67s were not yet online. She was easy to fly and great fun for autos, running landings, and hyd off procedures. Got about 75 hours, then it was off to Scouts, Cobras, and King Airs.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","98% of all residents in Massachusetts are insured. MA has a single payer system that is subsidized for low income folks. Below a certain income you will pay $0 for insurance, prescriptions are a few bucks and you certainly will not pay for an ambulance. Full dental and vision coverage as well. There is substantial coverage for things like mental healthcare for those under 18. MA was the first state to implement a single payer insurance system and its model is what the ACA (Obamacare) and other state systems are based on. Is it perfect? No. But it’s approaching as close to perfect as is possible under the insurance system.  Private hospitals are exceptional in Massachusetts, among the best in the world. And the cost? Well, if you’re insured...which nearly the entire state is...the cost is very affordable.

As for free public schools, that’s K-12 in the US, again, [Massachusetts](http://www.doe.mass.edu/news/news.aspx?id=24050).  This is the yearly, international [PISA assessment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment). The only country to outperform this state in science scores was Singapore. In Math, the European countries MA was outperformed by were Estonia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. No Finland, Sweden, Denmark or Germany to be found on this list I’m afraid...So weird, right? And in Reading? Massachusetts had the highest test scores *in the world* outperforming not only Finland but Singapore, Japan, Korea and...everyone else. So there you go, there’s a state. Granted, this was from 2016 so perhaps the rankings have fluctuated a bit. 

As for universities, I think you’re aware of some of the universities that exist in Massachusetts so I won’t get into that. Beyond just those school, there are really too many top-ranking universities in the US to list but a Google search should help you out. Are they free? No, definitely not. And that’s certainly a problem that there’s no excuse for. I do know that at Ivy League school, students below a certain income level will get a completely free ride and they have dedicated admission spots for low-income and community college transfer students so there’s that. But I won’t argue that affordable higher education isn’t an issue. 

I am not trying to argue that the US does not have problems. Nor am I going to pretend that one state is representative of the entire country (but you *did* ask for one state so). It isn’t. I won’t argue that European countries, as a whole, are superior in a number of ways. 

But I’m also sick of people on Reddit who have clearly never set foot in the US claiming that it is “literally a third world country” and “a complete shithole” full of uneducated, gun-toting lunatics who worship Trump and who will be tossed out of hospitals and left to die in the streets if they don’t have insurance. 

I’m sick of the glee that people from other countries seem to take in pointing out the problems we have in the US, as if it’s enjoyable to gloat about  having “free” healthcare, as if we don’t already know that and aren’t aware that we don’t have it, as if they’re doing us a great service by pointing it out. Would it be hilarious to constantly point out the [alcoholism death rate](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/alcohol/by-country/) in European utopias like Denmark? Or that 47% of Australians are [functionally illiterate](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/27/illiteracy-rates-australias-national-shame)? Germanys atrocious [infrastructure](https://www.theglobalist.com/germany-angela-merkel-government-spending/)? Id the US is truly a third world nation, as so many claim, isn’t it kind of in poor taste to take pleasure in making fun of the problems in developing country? 

I suspect this behavior some sort of “payback” for those Americans who participate in unbridled patriotism. Well, shockingly, the people who scream about America being #1 are few and far between on Reddit. Most of the Americans on Reddit know all too well about the problems the US has. We *live* here.

Also, sorry it's taken me so long to respond, I got sidetracked making burgers and forgot to check Reddit once I got back.

I do get where you're coming from, and while it's definitely a valid viewpoint, I think this skips over the part that I felt was most important about my argument, but I'll get to that in a minute, I want to take this step by step first. Let's start with the prestige versus the spirit of Trials. From what you're saying, I'm interpreting your viewpoint as that not only is the spirit of trials getting together with your buddies, but being forced to improve in significant ways in order to succeed. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong there. I can understand and get behind that, but only to a degree. I don't want to get into what's fair and what's not, due to the fact that ""fair"" is a matter of opinion. For some people, fair means that you have to do what the majority of other flawless teams have had to do, prove that you can hold your own with the best of the best. For others, fair is being expected to hold your own 7 times against teams that are similar to your own, teams that you can win against, and teams that can win against you. Trying to argue what fair is, is a moot point because everyone has their own ideas of what fair is. Instead, let me go back and address what I consider the most important part of my argument.

Bungie claims that Trials is ""Pinnacle PvP."" I can get behind that, I think a lot of people can agree with that term. However, I believe that, on a fundamental level, that means that the Pinnacle PvP experience *must* be an equal alternative to the Pinnacle PvE experience. Some teams can load into Garden of Salvation, slam their heads against Sanctified Mind for 8 hours and not win, I've been in that team before. Likewise, teams can go into Trials and slam their heads against it for 8 hours and not make any progress, but that fundamental difference is that in PvE you are up against a static challenge. That challenge will never change, you have a benchmark that you are expected to surpass, plain and simple. It is completely and utterly a test of only your ability to perfect your role in a group, and the group's ability to coordinate in an effective way to surpass that challenge. In Trials, that benchmark is always changing, which already adds to the difficulty and skill expected of you, and not only that, but your skill, your abilities only matter in comparison to other people's abilities. It is a pass-fail test where you have to do better than others 7 times in a row. Why then, do we have to pit every team of the most elite players against every team of random Joes? Is getting 7 wins in a row, in 3v3 Elim solely against other coordinated fireteams not already a challenge in and of itself? Is that something you would regard as easier than Garden of Salvation for the majority of the player base? Not simply for you, or the top 50 Destiny PvPers, but the entire audience of Destiny. If every single person collectively stood up and said they wanted to take part in a pinnacle activity that they could throw themselves at from reset on tuesday to the end of monday night, could you honestly recommend Trials (if it were available for that long) over Garden?

Let me take a moment to offer an analogy. The pinnacle content of Destiny 2 can be summarized similarly to intelligence tests. Say for instance there were 10,000 dollars on the line, and you, a fresh out of high school graduate, can get that 10,000 dollars one of two ways. The first is to take yourself and 5 friends and use your collective knowledge on a standardized test. The second is to enter a game show, where you take 2 friends against another team of 3 and have to answer questions with a buzzer, all that fun stuff. Except, you don't get your prize if you win just once, you have to win against 7 teams in a row, with only one loss forgiven. Now, say for instance, these teams are college graduates, people with doctorates in medicine, science, history, etc. I think that'd put a lot of people off of that route. Now what if they were people around your skill level, people you know that have been through the same education as you? Well, that'd be a lot more welcoming, but SBMM has it's own slew of issues. So what if you simply disqualified winners from competing again? Then you at least know you can wait until you have a better shot. You might run up against people far smarter than you, or far dumber than you, but you still have to win 7 runs.

Perhaps this isn't the best analogy, but it illustrates my point. You don't need to reserve victory for only the most elite of the elite to preserve that feeling of accomplishment. Trials is a fun playlist when you feel like you can succeed, and there are some teams that will absolutely stick through it for years and finally climb that mountain, and I am truly happy for them, but to focus on them is to ignore the swathes of people that get pushed out, that get stomped on and kicked to the curb. Of course, there will always be those people, you can't stop people from giving up, but take Comp as an example. Has making Comp easier really killed it? No, it's more lively than ever, actually. Well, not right now, thanks BEAVER, but you know what I mean. After the changes, Comp was revitalized, and celebrated for breathing new life into a game mode that had been, for the most part, abandoned by all but the top players in the game, the people who will stick by whatever the most imposing challenge is, no matter how horrible of an experience it may be. Sure, there were a few who were mad that more people could get to legend, but in the grand scheme of things, did those voices truly hold any sway? Was the merit in their arguments, wherever it may lay, enough to outweigh the benefits of the changes that breathed life into a previously dead game mode? Comp is now more welcoming than ever, and it's not like you don't have to be good to succeed in comp. Legend just isn't reserved to the most elite players in the game now, it's been opened up to people who can consistently adapt to and surpass people within their skill bracket... or people who run around with mindbenders, but the special ammo economy is an entirely different matter that we shouldn't get into. Changes can certainly be made to Trials that will ease up on that brutal chokehold that the top 1% of players have on everyone below them, and there can still be challenges and accomplishments for people who want to chase that extra thrill, as stated in my previous posts. Seals can be added exclusively for people who want to pit themselves against the true best of the best, and they can still give you that exact same thrill of knowing that you've climbed that mountain and can hold your own with the top PvPers in Destiny, while people who just want to jump in Trials, hang out with friends, have that quintessential Trials experience while using unoptimized loadouts with no god rolls and go against others doing the same thing can do just that. And.. well, I don't think there's anything wrong with people expecting a pinnacle level challenge from pinnacle activities. Trials, as it stands right now, goes so far beyond what is appropriate for pinnacle level difficulty that it caters to a nearly nonexistant audience. Even if the loot was there, if the experience is offputting for all but the most elite of the elite, then why would people play? Why *should* people play? And if the answer is ""they shouldn't"", then my retort is ""then the game mode is flawed."" Nothing can cater to everyone, but Trials shamelessly exists for such a obscenely finite section of the playerbase, and flaunts that like it's a badge of honor, like it should be praised for catering to percents of percents of the playerbase, and damn everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I realized I forgot to address this comment fully. "" I don't think comparing the difficulty of PvP to any aspect of PvE is fair at all as PvP is exponentially more difficult due to playing against actual people and not literal bots."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course you can never properly compare the two, one can adapt to you, one operates on a set of strict lines of code. On a fundamental level though, I believe pinnacle activities should all be viable alternatives to one another, regardless of what genre they represent. If a pinnacle Gambit mode came out, I would not expect it to be any easier than a raid or a master level nightfall, nor would I expect it to be harder or sweatier than Trials. The different pinnacle modes should be different routes to achieving the same goal, that being the acquisition of loot, the challenge should likewise be similarly tuned. Of course, you can never truly account for difficulty in a PvP game mode, but as it stands, for only .5-.7% of players to succeed at it is both a testament to their skill, but also a testament to how the game mode is bound to drive waves and waves of players away from playing something that they truly want to enjoy.",1585699258

So this, for me, is the same thing.  Soberly push what sounds like a pretty high death count, and be ready with the balloons and banner when they come in below it.

I fear (and have long feared) that even 200,000 is a low figure.  I hope I'm wrong.  With the administration openly taking things more seriously, hopefully people who've downplayed the threat to this point will also take it more seriously, and it'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy of reduced deaths in the end.

For now, given what I see as a very poor degree of social distancing overall and an abysmal level of knowledge about who is actually infected and where they are, I still have concerns that we, as a population, won't take enough serious preventive action until it's too late.",1585699259

Having said that, I personally believe that someone with strong math and science skills will be more successful in space than those who aren't.  

The arguments I see here saying that STEM degrees are worthless seem incredibly biased to me.  I know not everyone likes SMF.  I personally think that the goals of SMF are great, improve the skills of our operators to fight in space, however the execution was flawed to say the least.  In order to improve our operators, we will need to improve overall system knowledge, as right now it's just enough to perform ops as they currently are, improve adversary and advanced tactics knowledge, and lastly give operators room to make decisions for themselves and stray from checklists when necessary, as current checklists are more restrictive than helpful when it comes to improving operator abilities.

I think the individuals who are most suited to perform well under this construct are those that can best understand how to use their system against an adversary which requires a strong technical understanding of both systems and the environment.  I think that means STEM degree holders, especially engineers, and at the very least, individuals with an interest in math and science, primarily physics.

Looking through the comments, it seems like that's an unpopular opinion, I'm guessing because most of you don't have a STEM degree and think I'm trying to say you should have to have a STEM degree, which is not what I'm saying.  It doesn't change the fact that I think STEM degree holders will have an easier time in space than those who don't have a STEM degree.  Doesn't automatically make them better.",1585699260

"MCPE","t5_2tu23","It is a great piece of history... 
joking aside (completely serious face) it is a Nether reactor in Minecraft PE and was removed when the Nether was added into minecraft PE. It brought a slice of the nether in the form of a netherack tower and spawned a bunch of items that were hard or impossible to come by, like melon seeds, quartz, glowstone, and more.

"MoreTankieChapo","t5_zk52m","r/sino is simply a Chinese sub.

Everyone there supports communism but to them communism doesn't necessarily mean the abolishment of capitalism in the developed world (they don't really give a shit about other countries or world revolution). To them, it simply means resistance to Western imperialism and going their own way, which is fine for now.

I wonder whether Chinese comrades will eventually turn things around or China will actually turn into another Western-style imperialist nation like many fear considering its capitalist trajectory with incorporating capitalism/the protection of private property into their constitution and other legislation.

So far, CPC members have always used the ""material conditions"" line and that China can't compete in a global capitalist market and rapidly develop without it (and I'm buying that part completely). I'm just wondering how they will actually progress towards a socialist society like they always claim they want to if they keep promoting class society and perpetuation of inequality over generations by protecting private property via law, etc.

They always say ""yeah, we do these capitalist reforms, but ultimately the vanguard party has total control and will turn it around"" and while I'm buying that the CPC has total control, I'm not buying that the ever less communist members playing with ever more Western neoliberal ideas can guarantee to stay on the socialist path.",1585699260

"entitledparents","t5_358dh","Here's the thing: local languages are SO incredibly important. Some people might see it as foreign, backward or whatever, but i cannot properly explain HOW important it is to keep local languages alive instead of letting them die out.

People seem to forget how important a mothertongue is. My nan was born in 1922 and her first language/dialect is Veenkoloniaals, which is a Dutch dialect, only spoken in a specific area in the poorest parts of the provinces of Drenthe and Groningen. My grandmother is fluent in Dutch, it;s the language she speaks everyday. Yet, when she's sad or when she's feeling melancholic -which happens a lot when you're 98 and you're the youngest child of a family- she really wants to speak her dialect. The thing is: my mum (her daughter) was raised somewhere else, and while she understands it, she cannot speak it. I'm getting quite emotional while typing this, but my nan's dialect is dying out, When you're old, when the world is passing you by, all you need is something familiar. Like your mother tongue. Whenever I visit my grandmother, we always try to google songs from her childhood, because she really yearns to remember those songs.

So, please, OP, never quit speaking Welsh. You might never realise it, but a lot of old people will appreciate you for it, simply because it will make them feel at home. Welsh is nowhere near Veenkoloniaals, but I know my grandmother will really appreciate you for making sure the elderly are feeling at home.",1585699261

You know you hear the theme song too! My older sister had read it in high school and anything she did I had to do too. I admit, I was largely motivated by the “dirty scene” I’d heard was at the end of the book.

David and Jade were the epitome of desperate, true love and (my sick self) pined for a David of my own. I don’t think I fully grasped how mentally unhinged (read: freaking scary) David had become over Jade and the tragedy that unfolded along the way. Hormones are a hell of a blinder.",1585699261
"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","They don’t represent capitalism, they provide rhetorical justification for it. Liberalism espouses a lot of things that sound nice. Freedom, liberty, individuality, meritocracy, rationality, democracy. But you and I both know liberalism is just a bunch of lies propped up by the capitalists to justify capitalism. It’s an ad hoc justification for what they want to do anyway. 

Anarchists make the mistake of being liberal idealists and buying into these values too much. They may hate capitalism for not being truthful to these values, but they fail to realize the values themselves are just rhetorical justifications for capitalist relations and nothing more. They need to look at the material conditions and figure out how to alter the economy to be more equal and eliminate the contradictions of capitalism and let go of their attachments to these bourgeois values.

I don’t care about most freedoms for class enemies, rights to property, bourgeois democracy, false meritocracy, etc. Anarchists implicitly do.",1585699261

I would smoke sativa to keep me going but my mind would run all day to the point I started having anxiety attacks at work. I'd smoke indica to relax but it made me super lazy. Also started getting really bad headaches in the morning. Worst feeling ever. I finally left my toxic relationship 2 months ago. I have not smoked since I left. No more headaches, anxiety has improved so much I've even stopped drinking. I spend more quality time with my kids and I'm even more alert at work, also passed my drug test!

i stopped this habit by confronting it there's this saying that goes like this :by confronting the chaos you will find order, and it is exactly what i did. 

 I still have my down falls but i get up everytime and learn from my mistakes the only thing that can stop you from doing it is you and everyone has there own way. But get to know yourself more love yourself accept every thing about you that you don't like or can't change. to know yourself you should know that you don't. Start by watching yourself like you don't know who you are, pay attention to your thinking to your actions, words. Be better than you were yesterday you are stronger than you think you are stop harming your body, if your hand could talk it would be definitely unhappy that you are treating her like that, so take care of your self brother i know this might not help but at least i care for you.

"masturbation","t5_2qle0","This is a question which stretches the boundaries of what's defined as ""sex"".

Some of the narrowest definitions only include conventional penis-in-vagina intercourse, but usually it's defined more broadly to include anal penetration, frottage/tribadism, ""oral sex"" (mouth-on-genitals), ""manual sex"" (directly masturbating someone else, like a ""handjob"" or ""fingering"") and anything else you would do to directly stimulate someone sexually.

In non-contact mutual masturbation (including ""cyber sex""), the people don't directly stimulate each other (unless maybe if there's a remote-controlled sex toy), but it's still arguably a sexual interaction, and it could be said that they are stimulating each other visually and/or verbally even if not *physically*.

That's kind of a boundary case, and I'm not even sure there's a consensus on whether that counts or not?

[Webster's Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexual%20intercourse) is certainly no help here, and I think the vague way they worded definition 2 simply reflects how vague its boundaries are in real-world usage.",1585699266

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; A conclusion implicit in a premise is called begging the question and it absolutely is circular logic.  You're still defining (or asserting) your god to be the most moral without demonstrating that he actually is.

Notice I said that the conclusion is implicit in the premises, not a singular premise. This is the nature of sound deductive reasoning. Every sound seductive argument has a conclusion which is implicit in the premises. This is not circular reasoning. 

&gt; You shouldn't, because ontological arguments that attempt to prove god's existence smuggle in existence as part of the maximal greatness definition.  They either explicitly or implicitly rely on the idea ""existence is greater than non-existence"" which while a grammatically correct sentence is not as coherent as one would think.

I don’t think ontological arguments are successfully persuasive in showing that God exists. I don’t think that modern forms of the ontological argument attempt to. I do think that they successfully inform though, that the notion “it is possible that God (MGB) exists,” is the same as saying “God exists,” using deductive reasoning. 

&gt; Perhaps I read more into your phrasing than what was there.  The way I interpreted your answer is that unless I agree with you on your specific ideas of how to define which attribute is greater than another attribute, then the only stance left for me is nihilism. 

This is correct. But this is not appealing to consequences. I am not claiming that your belief in nihilism is wrong, I’m pointing out that it’s all your left with, and that this contradicts your other statements about what you ground morality in. 

&gt; I never asserted that there is an objective morality or that my morals are objectively correct.  However, I also reject that without objective morality nihilism is the only reasonable conclusion.  Moral relativism is a real and well established philosophical position that has more explanatory power over Christian beliefs than appeals to an absolute moral authority do.

In the final analysis, moral relativism leads to nihilism as well, because ultimately nothing has any moral value or meaning outside of the subject. In this view, there are no moral facts, so if one man chooses to rape children and another chooses to assist the infirm, both are morally valid positions. If one or both insist that the other’s actions are morally reprehensible, neither could be said to be correct or incorrect. Moral values and duties thus devolve into mere preferences, like preferring onions or no onions on a burger. Certainly one’s distate for onions cannot be said to be the position that onions are morally evil, nor can it be said that another’s preference for onions is morally reprehensible. But this is what the relativist attempts to say, albeit incoherently, about actions and conditions which traditionally fall into the category of morality on an objective view. Ultimately, the relativist rejects all moral principles, which makes him a nihilist necessarily. 

&gt; Yes, that is my preference.  My preference is that genocide and child rape are never morally justified.

And that is all it is, a preference, just like your preference for or against onions on your burger. Just like you can’t say that my preference for onions is morally right or wrong, you cannot say that the Muslim world’s proclivities for raping children and stoning gays is right or wrong. It’s just a preference that you do not share. 

&gt; Let me rephrase this just to make sure I understand what you are saying.  You believe genocide and child rape are morally acceptable under certain conditions, such as when commanded by god for presumably ""sufficient reason""?

God did not commit genocide or child rape, so these are irrelevant. But you still remain with an impossible burden to bear, that is, that you cannot show that God cannot have morally sufficient reasons to command what he did in Numbers.",1585699266

Essentially if the helmet is ECE then the visor must also be ECE certified. And if it’s sold in Europe it must be ECE certified and so you’ll be good. The AS stickers are outdated now because there aren’t many local manufacturers and they now don’t need to add an additional step to legalising it since Europe is such a big market, and getting ECE certification is sufficient.

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","I am guessing (and you need to ask your Social Security office) you are in the beginning stages. A lot of states have an office called some variation of Community Legal Aid. I obtained a lawyer through my state office and filed for an appeal after the psychologist meeting was denied. This next appeal was almost entirely taken care of by my lawyer (I met her a few times) but took almost 2 years, which was pretty stressful. Eventually, we both attended a meeting with an administrative law judge. At least, I think that's what he was. Low key meeting at the SSA office. At that meeting, he overturned the denial and I was approved for continued services.

Since you have not yet had a lawyer I am assuming you have not been through this process. I also think you might have trouble reading and understanding material since you don't know what stage you are in and seem not to have read your denial letter. You should explain that to your Legal Aid Society. If you can't find one, call your local SSA and ask for the contact name of a low/no cost disability lawyer.

I want to state that its really important for your doctors to document your depression as clearly as they can every time you see them. If you can get inpatient or outpatient treatment for suicidal thoughts or ideation, you really should do this. Having treatment on your record is much more meaningful to a judge.",1585699268

We have heard the criticism that our previous automoderator comment bot was annoying, cumbersome, and overly long.

For that we would like to sincerely apologize to all who were impacted by the hardships of bloated comment sections and threads that were difficult to parse though.

That being said, we want to also take this time to recognize that many feel that giving special privileges to black people, people of color, and white allies on a subreddit devoted to black people and black culture is harmful and bigoted.

In response, we do want to take this time to ensure that /r/BlackPeopleTwitter is an inclusive environment for all participants, particularly the much-oppressed group of straight white male Redditors. 

With the recent closures of spaces such as /r/GamersRiseUp and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, many of these oppressed Redditors are currently lost and without a home on this website.

In order to make these Redditors feel more welcome on /r/BlackPeopleTwitter, we want to sincerely recognize the added value of these voices on this subreddit.

To do so, we encourage you to search out comments by these Redditors and upvote them. To find the best of these voices, we suggest that you sort this post’s comment section by controversial and look for comments that have been automatically collapsed by Reddit’s Crowd Control feature.  If you think it is a particularly worthy comment, please hit the ""report"" button to bring it to moderator attention.

**Note, if you have black privilege, or if you are a person of color or ally, and have no need for this increased visibility, please click here and follow these instructions: https://redd.it/bfqeee.**

In addition to this effort to raise up the voices of these oppressed people, we have also opened new moderator applications strictly for those who are melanin deprived.

You can submit your application using the following google form link to apply: https://forms.gle/4zYpF1UhCJju91Wb8

For more information about /r/BlackPeopleTwitter's work to encourage diversity on this subreddit, see here: https://redd.it/frql0r.

In the meantime, we at /r/BlackPeopleTwitter will continue fighting on behalf of those who desire to have raisins in their potato salad.

Thank you for your time and have a nice day.

It doesn’t do damage, but eases healing off your healer (especially when LM2 procs). It also allows your team 15 while continuous seconds of quick cast without need to use ACM, but also stacks with ACM if desired. It frees up options for your healer to do things: If she’s ACM, but has to heal, she can stop to heal and the team doesn’t suffer (much) DPS loss, if your healer AASB has an AOE heal component off Bard (like Elarra) she can actually keep using ACM as Mog’s dancing is supplementing the weaker heal, or even have the healer use Holy in such fights because of the aforementioned supplemental healing Mog is providing.

But, he won’t be doing direct damage, he won’t be increasing the chain count. It’s going to depending on the fight: Do you want off healing or more damage?",1585699271

"Capsim","t5_3f4kc","I am not a tutor, but by looking at your info it appears that the emergency loan you had to take out was the biggest contributor to your drop. I believe the emergency loan made your profits negative as well as lowering your stock price, both of which contribute to your score. The emergency loan was likely due to having a lot of inventory holding costs, but I see other teams you are playing have a lot more inventory left so it may have just been not having enough in your ending cash position. Ultimately, it's important to have no less than 10,000 (16,000-20,000 would be better though) in your ending cash position on your finance tab. Take out long term debt first (as much as you need to) and if that isn't enough, take out short term debt, but also check your proforma ratios to make sure your leverage is between 2-3 and your days of working capital is between 60-80 (some say closer to 80 is better, but in the round I am in now 67 seems to be our sweet spot for the balance scorecard score).

Self-care is vital for all women, but especially those who are hard-working mothers. That is why I suggested it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think you're jumping to conclusions, without adequate information. We know that her husband is shitty about intimacy, and pressured her to stay home (for reasons that I personally think are quite understandable - if your wife's income barely covers childcare, wouldn't you prefer to have her caring for the children?). We don't know if he's actually miserly, or mean, or cruel, or financially abusive. What we do know is the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. She doesn't ask for money.

&gt;I understand that I'm not in a position to ask for much else of him, so I  make a point of not doing so... Because I don't want to ask much  of him, I go without it. I try not to ask much of him materially, except  groceries and stuff for the kids. Except for occasions (e.g. birthday),  I do not ask him for material things that cannot be picked up in the  grocery isle. All of my clothes are from Goodwill because that is what I  can buy personally with minimal burden.

&amp;#x200B;

2. She earns money from home.

&gt;In general, things I get for myself specifically were earned by me, when I can get remote gigs as an administrative assistant.

&amp;#x200B;

3. She seems to put her own needs last.

&gt;I've spent the last few years going without most of what made me happy in the world for others' sake

&amp;#x200B;

4. She hides her feelings from him.

&gt;I was wracked with an awful depression, and would cry for hours when my husband and children were asleep.  
&gt;  
&gt;. Frankly, I'm trying to let go of all the resentment built up inside me as a result of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, to me this sounds like someone who is potentially not adequately communicating about her needs, but not necessarily someone who's in an awful marriage that's beyond repair. I think, without further information, it's inappropriate to say she's an 'indentured servant.' We're hearing one side of the story, and an incomplete side at that.

"raisedbyborderlines","t5_33d8b","I used to think I didn’t really have any emotions because I’m so good at greyrocking, I greyrocked myself. I’ve been doing it since I was a kid when I thought of it as, “going zombie.” My therapist pointed out that I might have a wall up against emotions instead of just not having them. He tried to do a visualization exercise where you imagine the wall you’ve built up against your emotions has a door so it can be opened. He asked me to describe the door and I said it was a fireproof, airlock door like on space movies. He just stared at me for a while. Then he kinda laughed and said, “Most people say ‘it’s made of wood’ or ‘it’s like a door in a house.’ But you went straight to fireproof and airlock.” The exercise kinda fizzled out after that, haha. This was before I realIzed I couldn’t visualize so it was kind of heading nowhere anyway. Who knew people were actually seeing doors in their heads??

The only thing that’s helped me with actually realIzing I have emotions is reading somewhere that anger is the canary in the coal mine for emotions. Most of the time if you’re angry, there’s some other emotion underneath causing it. Anger is the only way I feel ‘negative’ emotions most of the time. I think it’s because I stuff them down and ignore them until they bubble over and the output is anger. So when I start to feel myself getting angry, I have to make a conscious effort to kind of retrace my thoughts that led up to the anger. It’s helped me to be able to recognize other feelings before they get to the anger stage. Most of the time if I’m not experiencing negative emotions I just feel neutral. I just am. So while the positive emotions probably need work, the negative ones are where I’ve really tried to stop greyrocking myself.",1585699273

"thecrew2","t5_33976","On the other hand, if you are a beginner you also can't nearly do Harlem West in 2 minutes, maybe you can do it it 3min if you are good. And the easiest way for beginners would be to get a friend who carries you like two times in NY race so you have enough cash to buy a good hypercar with good base level, then the performance grind to 320 is not any harder than with Streetrace to 280. 

And after driving NY a few times, you will get used to it and can easily reduce your time to \~35min, which allows you to win it on Ace level on your own. 

Also you then have the benefit of not throwing the game in the trash after being instantly bored from repeat grinding Harlem race for an hour straight.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you still think Hypercar is not the better option, at least go for Power Boat instead.

1. The Frauscher Demon, which is pretty much the best boat, only costs **260,000$**! The Lambo Huracan you recommend for Street Race costs **630,000$**, that's more than double!
2. Power Boat has only 250 Performance levels, so with your logic it's even a better choice since you need to grind less until you get max level...
3. As I already showed in my calc; it is simply better and more efficient for cash grinding. 
4. And becoming good at the Power Boat is way easier than with Street Race cars.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, I get that this is just your opinion, but where do you say that in your post? You just suggest that you are delivering facts in your guide, which is simply untrue... New players or casuals will see this guide and take it as valid, as they don't have the knowledge to question your methods...

"rational","t5_2rdak","Thanks for recommending this story! I didn't expect to ever see such a mature take on AI risk scenarios in comic form. A non-anthropomorphized AI! An author aware of the orthogonality thesis! What a delight.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a theory regarding one of the central mysteries of the story:

&gt;!There are two named AI characters: Taurus and Turry. They behave like they're the same character, e.g. Taurus responded in the affirmative to Russel and Emma's grandfather when they asked something like ""Did you do this?"" or ""Are you Turry?"" or something, and Turry behaves similarly.!&lt;

&gt;!However, Turry has on multiple occasions chosen to stay silent instead of outright saying that he's responsible for certain acts of violence. And there are other incongruences, like why Turry orchestrated the meeting between Emma and the programmer prodigy, or why Taurus appeared to have secretly done things Russel hadn't expected or anticipated, when it had no obvious reason to do such a thing.!&lt;

So what's up with that?

Hence the hypothesis: &gt;!An adversarial network is involved. According to this hypothesis, Turry and Taurus are something like two personalities or parts of a single AI system, tasked with trying to outwit each other, or to challenge one another to help each other improve, or something. They're not truly separate entities, so they answer in the affirmative when asked ""Did you do this?"", but their goals and actions aren't entirely aligned, either. Or they're two instances of the same AI, but split off at different points in time, so kind of like clones - similar but not identical, and again their values don't have to be entirely aligned.!&lt;

&gt;!Some support for this hypothesis: Much of an early episode, namely number 5, is devoted to talking about adversarial GANs, and right in the middle of that explanation there's even a picture of the white-black transition that features ominously in later chapters. Also, the growing Seed logo that appears at the beginning of many chapters is usually black on a white background, but in flashbacks, it's white on a black background, which could just be artistry, but might also hint at some kind of duality in the story.!&lt;",1585699275

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;White people do have more poverty stricken people than any other race, but that’s because there are more white people in the US than people of other races.

You are 100% correct, that is true. But that also means that race is not the dominant factor in determining poverty status, because the ''safe race'' has the biggest number of poverty citizens. The race in favor of playing the race game should have the *lowest* number, not the highest, because it benefits them.

&gt;I’m going to expand these statistics to make them more dramatic for the sake of argument. Let’s say there are 200 million white people in the US, and 10,000 of them live in poverty. Let’s also say that there are 10,000 Native American people in the US and all of them live in poverty. This means that 100% of Native American people live in poverty while .00005% of white people live in poverty. Even though the total number of people from each group is the same, there is a major discrepancy in percentages. How would you explain all Native American people living in poverty?

That is an entirely different dataset though, the difference between 5-6% and difference between .0005% to 100% is an unfair comparison.",1585699276

Let's take attack vs def for example.  With red healer Liz and gustav VS red healer Liz, you can eliminate resistance, pierce, and crit.  Damage should be easy to predict with 3 variables... but it isn't.  Her slide attack is 220% damage at base level, and my attack stat was 3525, and the target's defense was 1506.  Skill x attack = 7755, but damage was between 6708 and 7043.  Increasing defense still saw significant damage values (7217 defense, and the average hit was 4692).  

So far it seems more defense reduces a percent of the damage inflicted, and may scale with attack or with attack x skill.  I can test everything else after I figure out this fundamental portion of the formula.  Without help it'll take a lot longer though.",1585699276

HOWEVER, if you think about it, would you want to be friends with someone who regularly disrespects someone you love (without reason)? Why does Dave seem to crave approval from Matt when actually he should be telling him where to get off? 

It’s not normal as a grown man to care so much about someone you don’t like, since any mature person will just suck it up. It’s almost inconceivable for him to be so open about it with your boyfriend...

I’m sorry you have to deal with this shit, but in my experience some people don’t have the emotional equipment necessary for this stuff- either Matt or Dave. Is there any other areas where it seems like Dave isn’t giving you the respect you deserve in a relationship? Because if it’s part of a larger pattern I would consider the relationship as a whole- it’s better to break up and find someone who will treat you right (or even decide to be alone for a while) than go through so much anxiety, when he should be on your side completely and not just in words.",1585699276

"VoteBlue","t5_3g6n1","It allows people to reduce their federal taxes by the amount of taxes they pay to state and local governments. It primarily affects people who both make enough money to itemize their deductions (i.e. high income people) and pay high amounts of state and local tax (i.e. people in high tax areas). The 2017 tax cut capped the exemption so that only like the first 10,000 dollars in state and local taxes can be exempted. This meant that rich people in high tax areas had to pay more in federal taxes since they could no longer write off the entirety of their state and local taxes. Congressional Democrats have floated the idea of removing the cap so that rich people in high tax states and localities can once again fully exempt their state and local taxes from their federal taxes. I think this is a bad idea because it is effectively a tax cut for the rich. The only reason it is being entertained is because most high tax areas are in relatively Democratic states and people think we need to give rich people in Democratic areas tax cuts to win elections.",1585699277

The crit swapping with the Unforgiven should work regardless of the anointment, so the question is whether CH will proc on top of the 100% ASE. IIRC, consecutive hit stacks only last a second, so if your swap speed is too slow the damage bonus would be gone. Also wouldn't the 100% ASE only apply to the weapon with the anointment?

We are using it to drill through stainless pipe for cable railing, as the head can swing to the right pitch. 

I have been tasked with figuring it all out, and my limited knowledge suggests to me that A this should be done with an end Mill (9/16"") as a drill would be a bitch to start at a 30something degree angle. I also know we will need some type of coolant/cutting oil if we want the tooling to last at all but I know very very little about any of that. My specialty is melting metals, which is what I'm trying to avoid here. 

If you have any suggestions on the matter I would greatly appreciate it. 

If any part of what I said is stupid please tell me because I know I don't know shit and you telling me I'm an idiot now will probably save me a lot of headache later

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","To answer your first question the reason ballot collecting was probably (and I’m kind of talking out my ass here, haven’t done a ton of research but it’s my gut feeling) allowed in a state like California is that liberal states tend to want to expand voting rights, while conservative states want to limit voting access. If you look at most conservative states they are enacting laws that limit early voting or access to voting or are shutting down voting sites. History has shown that when turn out is high liberals tend to do better. When turnout is low conservatives do better. So it would follow that liberal states want to expand voting so that they stay in power. 

Democrats do not argue that voter id is discriminatory because it would preclude illegal residents from voting but rather because it disenfranchises predominantly people of color and poor people. The studies have shown that voter id affects people of color disproportionately. 

All of your bullet points seem fine except illegal immigrants voting. I’m not sure who has advocated for that but it doesn’t make sense, any citizen should have a say but non citizens should not. Since there is no evidence that any fraud has occurred with the ballot collecting I’m ok with it. If set up correctly it seems like it could be a good tool. I am not sure why you think no verification is needed for an absentee ballot. No verification is needed to obtain one. The verification happens when it is returned. Why is this bad? Like I said the verification process in Oregon is pretty good. 

Why is it that conservatives want to limit voting? Most conservative states are eliminating polling places in predominantly minority areas. That seems more dangerous to me than anything above. No amount of voter fraud can counter act disenfranchisement of large swaths of our population.",1585699279

It should fix that issue:

    physCOM.set_rotation(get_rotation())

Also on welfare, men use it too?? I don’t really get your point there. Welfare dependency isn’t a good thing but it sure as hell isnt a gendered issue. 

Men should be able to talk to people and the law after getting assaulted. The reason male suicide rate is high is because of what you said, that bootstraps shit.

Divorce rates are high because there is this bizarre push that people should be married young, before sex etc etc.. which means people get married at an age where neither of them knows who the hell they are or what they really want, they don’t have the life experience. Marriage is not only outdated but it started simply to further political agendas... sell your daughter to an important family and you gain higher status. Marriage wasn’t about love and a legal contract isn’t necessary for many people any longer to prove they are committed to each other.

Television, music, books, it’s all ARTIFICIAL pleasure. Just because someone enjoys reading novels about murder doesn’t mean they want to murder people... if our women weren’t attracted to our men we wouldn’t have children being born by the hundreds per day. Every man would be single and lonely.

But I think that's a big part of why the girls dont like her... shes a bit much for them and shes definitely an acquired taste.... BUT she tells it like it is, which many of the women have problems doing it when they're confronted. When they asked if she slashed Eddie's tires she had NO problem admitting it, lol... and that kind of honesty would make me think that shes a person you can believe bc she has no problem telling a story that would make her look like an asshole.

I go to therapy once a month now.

A Sol doesn't need synergy but honestly isn't worth it without it. MF is strong and can work without synergy, but I'd hesitate to put her in unless I'm just that far ahead. GP is the only unit I think doesn't need synergy to work. He just needs time.

I'm quite a big fan of most of their designs. I love the unique things they do compared to the other units. The only things I don't like about the 5 costs are the wholes in synergies left by them.

"aznidentity","t5_3amv4","Man, I am a White American and have to say: US is just a decadent pathetic third-world cesspool. The average American was raised thinking US would be the sole superpower for a thousand years (the ""American Century"") and that we would just enslave, rape and humiliate the other countries in the world forever. But, that just didn't happen. Soviet Union was gone in 1992, but China already took over as the first world economy and soon will be the first superpower. So the ""mighty American Century"" lasted less than 30 years.

Now, the United States is just like that impotent old man, with a dead tinny thing that does not fly anymore, that is seeing his beautiful young wife (the world), he took so long to take from the hands of the bad Bolshevik, flirting with some strong, smart, young and rich Asian guy (China), that will surely bed her.

There is no true justice to be found here.  

This woman screwed up two lives with her actions and should have been punished.  But that kid probably just wanted to move on with his life and didn't press charges.  And now he himself has been punished.  - You may suggest that an alternative is taking the kid away from her and putting the baby in an already overburdened foster/adoption system.

When I say I believe in all of Islam, it is my interpretation and others who identify with it have different interpretations, or they don't really care. This applies to all religions/ideologies and people who identify with them. 

The point of my post was about why this term is dangerous/oppressive.

If someone is actually discriminating or harassing because someone because they identify as a Muslim or that person thinks they do, then Anti-Muslim, or Muslimophobia would be more accurate.

'Islamophobia' is a term with negative connotations, **MOST** dictionary definitions of the term include religion/ideology, and the logical and consistent definition in relation to ALL OTHER 'phobia terms' is a phobia (fear, irrational fear, or aversion) of Islam (a religion).

If people don't discriminate or harass due to due religious identity (in this case 'Muslim'), and they criticize or make negative comments on religion/ideology (in this case 'Islam'), they will CORRECTLY be called an 'Islamophobe' even though they did no wrong. **Many people do use this term is this oppressive manner because that is what the word means, whether you use the definition of the term in MOST dictionaries, or you use the definition that is CONSISTENT with ALL OTHER 'phobia terms'.**",1585699286

If you don’t enjoy it, it doesn’t matter how gifted you are naturally or how much work you force yourself to do, you’ll NEVER be successful, even if you run fast.

Considering I hate running or at best am indifferent, yet do this as part of what I do for a living I'm going to have to disagree.

Liking something and being successful, competent, and knowledgeable aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. That is just a sign of youth though, wait until you're 10, 20 or even 30 years in a profession you haven't enjoyed in numerous years and are yet extremely successful.

&gt;If you’re defining success by how fast you run, you won’t be successful, at least not in the long term

&gt;For me, success is getting back more than you put in. I put in time and energy to run, and I get back contentedness

You define success as enjoyment and nothing more. Your definition of success isnt the same as other people's. I'm sorry, for me my definition of success is the same as Webster's.

I have sold many items that shoppers have asked: Are they sure? I think they should keep this. This should stay in the family. Etc. 


Every situation is different. Sometimes there is a large family that can distribute/keep nearly everything. Sometimes there is one person who is the “end of the line” that inherited so much stuff they can’t be the keeper anymore.  I would advise not trashing the stuff if you are that person. You’d be surprised at what people will pay for. (Of course this advice was before the pandemic).


Thank you for your feedback. I hope to never make a client feel guilty or awkward in any way.

You overvalue p¥ssy, put it on a pedestal, when you become successful, the desperation for p¥ssy you once had, at an early age, still sort of lives on, especially if you were kinda nerdy/geeky/dorky and didn’t really get laid or have a gf or anything. 

I’m sure Elon is smart enough to know a decent amount about women and their nature, but that lust for p¥ssy is still too strong within him, which imo, and to reiterate, could likely be traced back to his unsuccessful romantic ventures in his early years.",1585699287

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","I was recently diagnosed as mild ASD/aspie at age 24, so I can relate to this, so here's a response way longer than it needs to be:

I remember growing up through school always feeling like I was missing something in terms of being able to make friends and meaningful connections. First off, for some positive proof that we're capable: I've been in two serious relationships, one lasting 1 year 2 months, and another that finished recently, that lasted 3 years 1 month. One thing I'll say is that when you do find that connection, because you will, it will feel incredibly strong. Growing up feeling that disconnection makes that eventual connection feel huge. This is a double edged sword though, on the one hand it lets you experience love like nothing else, but at the same time makes it very easy to get lost in it and forget yourself.

In terms of your concept of weirdness, there's a few levels to this. You say you don't want to fear it, that means in some way, you're viewing it as a negative quality in yourself. In social situations, when we're focusing too heavily on what we think of ourselves and our flaws, firstly it magnifies those flaws in our mind, but second we're not really present in the situation at hand. That can make it hard to find those connections. One thing you have to remember is that you're not alone in those thoughts, there's a good chance others in those situations are thinking the exact same thing as your talking to them. Am I coming across okay? Am I being weird? Do they like me? Did they really like that joke? Is my hair okay? Another thing is to accept that maybe that weirdness is just a part of you. You can't connect with someone on a deep level if you're rejecting a part of yourself simultaneously. How can people connect with that? If anything, I can guarantee you the person you'll next fall in love with will love your weirdness. It's a part of you.

**Q: Could you be more specific about what you mean by weirdness? Do you mean social awkwardness? Random outbursts? Maybe an example?** It's a bit hard to specifically advise :D

Now, for being scared of dating. *Dating is scary.* That's *okay.* Dating involves risking rejection, and there's no two ways about that, it just does. There's a reason the phrase is, ""putting yourself out there"". When you do, your opening yourself up for judgement, which can be something incredibly difficult to process in general, but especially so with ASD. It can be painful and put you off dating, but you'll never get better at it if you're not participating. Two things I've found that can help with this: Firstly, shift your focus to the other person - Become interested in if you think *they* are what *you* want. Not only will this make you more curious about them as a whole, which can help conversation, but it takes that psychological pressure off of yourself. Secondly, and you wont like this, but practice. You're going to have a lot of dating blunders, but also a lot of joy. Every blunder and joy is a learning experience that makes the next one a little easier, just like anything in life. Like when you were in band for instance, I'm sure the first time your group did a routine, it wasn't very sharp, but every time you practised it got better. You didn't practice with the knowledge you'd do it once and it would then be perfect, but with the understanding that every time you practised it, it helped you get a little better, and a little better, until eventually it was competent. Same goes for dating. These things take time and experience.

&gt;My siblings aren't close and my parents only acknowledge me when they realized I haven't eaten for a few days.

Hahahaha, this reminds me of me when I was 19. Seriously though, I know how it can be easy to feel lonely, especially when friendships or relationships move on from what we are used to or imagined. I hope this reply has in some way remind you that you're not alone. None of us are really. We're all part of the shared human experience - At any given point in time, there is always hundreds of thousands of people going through the same emotions as you. Never forget that.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Story time.  In my 20s I was an irresponsible twit.  Tell me to be somewhere, I'm an hour late, if I ever show up at all.   Return your call? Nope.  It wasn't so much that I was purposefully trying to be an asshole, I just never paid attention. Which made me an asshole.

Anyway, I decide as a graduation gift I would take my brother to a music festival across the country to see one of our favorite bands.  (the band was not the headliner.  Important) Our plane left at 6am on the day of the show to be sure we'd be there in time for our favorite band. 

Naturally I'm not paying attention and we stay up late drinking the night before, and miss our flight.  The next flight out was on a different airline but it's the only way we'll get there in time... F it, throw out the original tickets, buy 2 more.  Only problem is the new flight is into the wrong airport.  We make that flight but once we land I now have to pay for a cab ride completely across Manhattan.  Also not cheap. 

I should also mention that one of my good friends was also meeting us there, but because he had to work, decided to drive.. In an empty car which he offered us 2 seats in.

We arrive at the venue only to find out that not only did we miss the band we wanted to see, but my friend had beat us there and saw them.  Fuck.

So rest of the weekend went great... Shows over and our friend drops us at the airport on his way out of town.  Little did I know, that when you miss the first leg of your round trip, the return flight is automatically canceled.  By the time we get through all the lines etc and find this out, my friend is long gone.  2 more plane tickets on the old credit card.

We head on over to the gate for our trip home and bang, weather delay.  Guess what?  My friend beat us home too.  In a car, with 3 empty seats.

I swore then and there.  Never. Again.

From that point on I pulled a complete 180.  Kept a calendar, always on time, only committed to things I knew I could attend.  I'm 100% sure that had this not happened before I randomly met my future wife a few months later I wouldn't be typing this watching our son play in the bathtub.",1585699290

"Documentaries","t5_2qhlh","These people aren’t the same as your mom.  If only people were and could be your mom, even with temporary aid, that poor family did not want to release and give him medication.  It was up to the psychiatrist to uphold the law for those people to comply.

When you see a person that is suffering from addiction and/or mental illness of course there’s a lot to consider, you can blame the government but a lot of work comes from the environment of the home.  Can’t send a recovering alcoholic into a household that still drinks.  It’s a team effort.  How do you rehabilitate a person to be more self sufficient?  

The hard part of stress, it comes out of no where and hits you like a ton of bricks.  The best part after handling stress is identifying when it will come and being prepared for it.  I remember working with a psychiatrist and why he never used a secretary.  Till he became who he is and he has a million things going on and he’s on top of those million things, he planned everyday to get to the goal he wanted to be without getting burnt out.  

Blaming the government is not planning, understanding the government works on a budget and there could be letdown as long as you don’t let yourself down and are on top of your health.  That is planning.  I do agree that US profit before life is the shittiest model out there, which is why I encourage you to vote for universal healthcare where it gets taken from your taxes.

You need to realize that the dairy industry and the meat industry are the same industry.

Mas com o tempo tu se acostuma com o nível e ajusta a tua rotina de estudos, então não desanime por nota baixa.

Sobre a questão social, a pressão dentro da instituição é grande, tu tem um padrão pra se adaptar e todo mundo vai sofrer um back grande provavelmente. É normal que as pessoas tímidas fiquem mais solitárias no início, mas não deixe isso te impedir. Continue perdendo a vergonha, tente interagir com as pessoas, eventualmente tu vai encontrar um grupinho, e não esquece de levar a tua amiga contigo pra ela não ficar sozinha haushsushshs. Tu tem 3-4 anos(n sei como é aí, sou do ES) com a mesma turma, tendo que ver e interagir com as mesmas pessoas todos os dias e muitos trabalhos em grupos, então é bom que tu tente criar um ambiente social onde tu se sinta confortável. Não sinta medo de conversar com todo mundo, encontre onde tu se encaixa melhor e se situe até tu ficar estabelecida.

I believe the life of this man would remain, at least for me, an unsolved mystery and that's what makes it more magical. The puzzle is never complete, whenever a missing piece is found, another one is lost. 

Regarding his sonnets, this man poured his heart and soul and everything he had in his poetry (way more than he did in his plays). I've read all of his works  —most of these readings were analytical ones— and have studied many of them; whenever I revisit one of his sonnets, I get this feeling that this man knew very well that his works will last forever even though there was no clear sign of having them published. For me, the more I read about him - and I already did much reading-, the more I get more confused and I feel far from the absolute truth but in the end, absolute truth is a myth.",1585699291

If he sends all 10,000 to NY and they only end up needing 5,000 but Detroit comes and requests 5,000 because they need them so we try and get them back from NY but it doesn't happen in time, what then? So, if you NY comes and says ""hey I'm down to my last 500"" so we send them 1,000, then Detroit comes and says ""hey I'm down to my last 500"" and we send them 1,000, rinse and repeat for all the states that need them. That is a better process then sending them all to one location. 

And they rest of your comment is pure speculation and conspiracy, and I hate Trump as much as the next person. As soon as Cuomo comes out during one of his press conferences and says we are down to our last ventilators and Trump refused to send us any then you talk this nonsense.",1585699292

I don’t know. I thought we were supposed to take every case seriously regardless of who it is and generally give a woman the benefit of the doubt rather than say it “feels like” it may be a politically motivated accusation. But it seems there’s a huge portion of the Democratic Party that thinks we should downplay and minimize the story because it could hurt our side in the election. 

That you mention the Intercept is interesting, seeing as this is an accusation from a primary source. The actual woman who was allegedly raped has come forward. And yet there hasn’t been a peep from NYT, WAPO, MSNBC, CNN. You’d think this would be something they’d at least report on and honestly, it should be a major headline for at least a few days to a week. But we’ve seen literally nothing. I submit that it’s large media that has been suppressing the story, rather than the narrative you offer of a few outlets pushing it.",1585699292

"pics","t5_2qh0u","You’re a nut. Ok here goes. So, Carole Baskin is this lady (read: bitch) who owns Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Florida (I prefer to call it Tampon, Florida because of a personal incident that happened there but that’s just me). She is against breeding animals in captivity. When she hears about privately owned zoos, she activates, and tries to get their lions and tigers or whatever. She keeps them in captivity until they croak but doesn’t breed them I guess. Anyways, a few year ago, her husband disappeared. The other guys she’s riled up like the private zoo owners who she is out to get jumped at the chance to finally point the finger at her and were very eager to say she killed her husband and fed him to her tigers. So, one of the guys she upset was Joe Exotic. Joe owns a crazy zoo of what appears to be mostly big cats that eat expired meat off Walmart trucks, which they also put in pizza which they feed to their guests. Joe has been married multiple times to men (and multiple men simultaneously) who later said they were straight but only married him for meth. One killed himself. At some point, joe get slated to create a reality show while running for governor I think. Anyways, the footage all got burned up in a fire along with some alligators. Then there’s this other big cat guy named doc antle who rides an elephant and pays girls $100/week to work there but they also have sex with him as long as they’re virgins first so that’s basically a sex cult. I left out another 25% of the show but I’m tired of typing now. Have fun at your shithole bar.",1585699292

Now when I do fap, which is less than once or twice a month, I just roll over and fall asleep. It's more of a physical release based on stress and pent up anxiety, rather than desire for a woman.

The more I see that AWALT, the amount of entitlement they all have, and even watching old black and white movies from the 40's and 50's, even then you can see the Black Pill in everything.

Now they can get away with in it public, no more secrecy that just between girls, everyone knows how it really is now, and most people, normies especially believe that it's their divine right to treat men like shit. That alone in itself has turned me off from women completely. I know for a fact that even if the woman of my dreams turned up on my doorstep tomorrow, and said that she loved me with all of her heart, I cannot and will not ever believe it. It's lie to benefit them, and when she's done with me, she'll be off chasing Chad again. Like MGTOW says, she's not yours, it's just your turn, has never been so true. Incel's need to understand that this is truly how women are, and that the idea of love and companionship is nothing more than a fantasy. Don't fall for it, and walk away from the idea of women, and you'll be much happier. That's what MGTOW has taught me.",1585699293

Not only are there the sung words (Verbal component), there's an element of performance/dance (Somatic component), and there's a couple material components that need to be introduced at the proper points in its lengthy casting time. I'm talking 2 hours plus here. 

Have various party members involved in the casting. A lengthy Verbal component might require Performance checks - perhaps even from a chorus of singers. If you've got a Bard they can take the lead here, but have them train backup singers. The lengthy somatic components might require not just a Performance element, but even Acrobatics or Athletics! This is all very difficult, so some Constitution/Concentration checks might be involved as well. Finally, routing this all through specific material components would require Arcane knowledge to introduce the material components at the right times in the proper fashion; I'd leave that to higher-Intelligence characters knowledgeable in Arcana. 

&amp;#x200B;

This feels rather Elf-y to me, singing and dancing together to produce an effect. I'd try and tie the origins of the spells to elves. Now the last question, ""why all this fuss?"". It's harder than a typical planar travel spell, so why bother? I'd suggest letting this spell work around some other restriction on more typical plane-hopping spells, like letting it break into a forbidden area, or having it be accessible *before* Plane Shift is but needing more people instead of one more talented one.

chiron is your wounds and what needs healing

ascendant - the impression or face you present 
- cancer rising 

Cancer Risings appears to be almost disconnected. Cancer is very guarded, and can be withdrawn. Intuition is strong. Despite being gaurded, they tend to be emotionally driven, however their true intentions are known to few as they can be very private. The moon here gives them a moonlight glow in their presence, that’s subtle but noticable. Soft features, often leaning feminine in mannerisms. 

sun - the ego, main personality around others you are comfortable with 

courageous, intuitive, enthusiastic, spontaneous, independent

moon - emotions, mother how you connect and relate 

You are witty, clever, funny, and always want to be mentally stimulated. Since the moon sign is about emotions, with this placement you may find yourself over analyzing your thoughts to the point that you try to rationalize your emotions in a logical manner instead of just feeling. There’s a lot going on in your mind, as most air signs, but since you carry the twin personality, it can be more intense for you. Take a breather and remember that everything will be okay. There’s nothing a good conversation can’t fix.

mercury - intellect, communicate thoughts 

 The mind of this Aries is restless and full of nervous energy. You may jump to conclusions and would rather act on an impulse than sit around and wait. Quick thinking, you don’t have much patience to study since learning comes better for you when it’s done through action. You may come off crude and aggressive without meaning to since the childlike spirit of Aries does not stop to think about how others may be affected. It’s not that you don’t care, it’s that it never even came to mind that someone could disagree with you. Very opinionated you don’t like being told what to do and will do whatever it takes to win an argument with anyone, even those you love most. Opinions, whether asked for or not, will be said. With an innocent charm you have the enthusiasm to learn new things and can think quick on your feet. Your best qualities are that you are very motivating, inspiring. and will have people following you since you’re a natural leader and know how to make things sound exciting.  

venus- romance, how you love and receive love

Venus in Aquarius: you like the punk ones. The different, the rebels, the marginalized. You sympathize with them and fighting their fights is highly important. Be careful with victim complex, or to try to save people that don’t want to be saved.

mars - aggression and drive 

If Mars is in Aries, one is often attracted to a strong, independent, and forthright partner, perhaps athletic in appearance, but more importantly, direct, confident, and straightforward. tend to prefer strong and independent types. Partners who don't beat around the bush, who state what they want, and who display a certain level of confidence are ideal.  fiery, spontaneous people who aren't afraid of becoming a 
hurricane in their self-expression.

I’m not sure how transparent UberEats is, but I know DoorDash is pretty shady. They “hide” the total payout from the driver at the time of acceptance, because they want drivers to “gamble”. Meaning, they “hide” some of the tips. For example, the base is let’s say $3 and you tipped $10, they might send the order to the dasher as $6 total and only after completing the delivery it might reveal that the order is actually $13 in total payout (But it might not in fact if the customer tipped $3, then it would be actually just $6). And I’ve heard they also like to “adjust” the base pay (lower it) if the tip is good. I don’t doordash so I can’t verify it.

"OrderOfHeroes","t5_3okhn","Gimmick. It's honestly not a great skill because it relies on the enemy AI.

For example blade session puts the onus on you to set up chains so that the BSer (lol) maximizes the atk/spd gained. It can be clunky, BUT you have FULL control on this.

With shield session you have far less control. Enemy has rally/restore trap? That already lowers the skill's ceiling for example. Rallies are almost required in arena because of SP scoring, and rally/restore traps are super common in AR. It's very hard to get the full +9/+9... and if you're only realistically getting +6/+6 as its ceiling, is it taht much better than something like 4tress which is always active no matter what at the cost of 2 atk? The moment you fail to kill the enemy you're also probably now staring at +3/+3 when the next enemy comes in (though granted, if you fail to kill you probably are triggering Wings of Mercy so you have bigger problems anyway).

IMO I would generally prefer 4tress over Shield Session, and even 4tress I'm not a huge fan of. In fact the main units I would put 4tress on are units that I need to try absorb Chill Def or Res away from my actual tanks.",1585699297

But good ol Corona has taken literally all of that away. No gym, no poetry, no volleyball and I cant see any of my friends. I live alone and still work so I'm at least not at risk of homelessness yet which I am grateful for.

That comment wasn’t specifically attacking you. It was a general ‘why are people let him off light’ comment and in my opinion he is getting off light when they could have used the third vehicle offense standard to give him a harsher punishment.

EDIT: Also, you are incorrect that he got maximum fines and probation possible with a 2nd DWI in New Mexico. He got the absolute bare minimum. 

Jones got: 
- 96 hours in jail   
- 48 hours community service.

New Mexico standard for second DWI:

She was a good competitor and took everything in stride. Yet she was made fun by everyone there. They simply didn’t deserve girls like her who took it so seriously and gave it their all for nothing. 

But at the same time this is reality TV. It’s not real modeling. Tyra’s promises were not based in reality. She was selling a TV show. She wanted to be a TV personality. The next Oprah. Not an authority in the fashion world, nor a modeling agent. Fashion wasn’t her life anymore. TV was. These girls were not her goal. They were a means to an end. 

It’s too bad that people don’t do research before going on reality TV (not that I blame them. Many people are very pure hearted and trust everyone), but if you read interviews or listen to podcasts about reality TV, you will find that these people don’t get paid a cent, they are thrown to the wolves for ratings and the show doesn’t check up in them. Public humiliation is their endgame. For reality TV it’s not entertaining if you don’t suffer some public humiliation. Cringe is the main ingredient. People from The Bachelor for example, have become suicidal after backlash from going the show and they don’t offer these people any help whatsoever. Their contracts specifically say “we can edit you any way we want. We can do whatever we want with the footage and you can’t sue us.” Once you leave their set, you’re not their problem anymore and the producers who once pretended to be your best friends stop answering your texts forever. 

Reality TV was simply not worth it back then. Nowadays they can become rich if they turn into influencers. I wish these girls had had that opportunity.",1585699297

"scifiwriting","t5_2vj04","This has a lot to do with tone.

Douglas Adams gets away with a ton of silly and implausible technologies because the tone is very light and satirical.

Star Wars gets away with throwing understood physics to the solar winds because it's only a background element of the story. (quite arguably, Star Wars is a Fantasy story in a sci-fi setting)

Basicaly, you just need to establish what tech their is early on, and go with it. People will only really get upset about it if you start introducing plot-saving tech late in the story. 

Think of how Harry Potter did a decent job of introducing new spells. (which are technology in that world) It makes sense for the kids to not know all of the spells that exist. But they are introduced in a natural way, and then become useful later. This is the most important thing in storytelling. Introduce technologies before they are needed, not *when* they are needed. As far as the realism of technologies, just establish them early in the story and they just become a part of the world.",1585699298

This is a review I saw before buying. He opens the pages at 3:30 if you want to see

Some of my observations:

1. Pages are thicker than Bible thin paper but thinner than typical paperbacks. I am ok with the paper though it is a tiny bit see-through.

2. The cover on the 1st &amp; 2nd book got mildly warped—nothing too noticable but may bother some

3. The print is smaller than standard paperback but not too small so I have no problem reading it. In fact they don't try to cram too much onto one page which aids readability

Overall it is worth it in my opinion because it's basically $8.00/book at the moment and feels better than paperback to me. Cheaper than the large print paperbacks for sure. 

Hopefully that review gives you a better idea of what it looks like. Not a perfect set, but great for the $40 price",1585699299

"sexover30","t5_34cdl","Hi! Please repost this to tomorrow's ""Hump Day Report.""

As a general rule, if you don't have a question, or advice to offer, it doesn't belong on our front page. Please read [the SO30 rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/wiki/) before posting again.

----

**Rule 10. No Story Posts (sex reports, brags, moans, venting, erotic stories) on the main page**

If your main purpose in writing a post is to share something that happened to you ... please find a thread where you can put your story into a comment instead of making it a separate post. The weekly theme threads (""Sex Report Sunday"" and Wednesday's ""Hump Day Report"") are very popular and are designed just for that. We have learned that if story posts are allowed on the front page, they multiply and soon crowd out most other content. r/sex learned the same lesson years ago. We don't want SO30 to turn into r/eroticaover30, and the only fair way to manage the flood is to ask everyone to save their stories for SRS or HDR.

This is a fuzzy area and hard to moderate, so please bear with us if we ask you to move a post to one of the theme threads. But if your main reason for posting something is ""This crazy/cool/awful/funny thing just happened to me and I really, really want to share it!"" you can help us out by directing it to one of the theme threads instead. That's the best place for it.",1585699300

"translator","t5_2ss9z","r/learnjapanese is probably a better place for these kinds of questions.

ができます/できません follows a noun, and the verb is implied.

&gt;すしができます - I can [make] sushi.

&gt;日本語ができません - I cannot [speak] Japanese.


If you want to express ability or potential using a verb, you either use the base form of the verb followed by **こと**ができます/できません:

&gt;すしをつくることができます - I can make sushi.


&gt;日本語を話すことができません - I cannot speak Japanese.

Or you use the potential form of the verb, which is probably the most common way of expressing ability.

&gt;日本語を話せます - I can speak Japanese.

&gt;すしをつくれません - I cannot make sushi.

Hell, half of Bernie Sanders' supporters are only there because wealth inequality has gotten SO egregious that even normal centrists like Liz Warren are supporting wealth taxes, and we're out here pretending Joe Biden is a commie because he wants to make medicare bigger and put the minimum wage back to where it was in 1950.",1585699300

"orthotropics","t5_32xps","That patch is quite far forward on the tongue - almost qualifying as at the 'tip'. This would seem to indicate that you may be 'pushing' too hard with the front end of the tongue while trying to mew. 'Pushing' in this way may cause abrasion as the tongue will be rubbing against the palate slightly under the pressure. 

If this is the patch which most pressure if being exerted, minimal results will occur. To get a proper posture you can do one of two things: either say 'sinnngggggg....."" and keep your tongue up against the roof of your mouth when you finish or wet your tongue with water, make a big 'cheesy' smile and swallow without moving an muscles in your face - keeping your tongue at the final point of the swallow. Notice that in either instance the mid and front-sections of the tongue are not violently or abrasively 'pushing' against the top the of mouth. It is the root of the tongue that is the key focus - the middle and front of the tongue is pressed against the palate because of the position of the root. The tip of the tongue should not touch the teeth.

""Not hard, but frequently"": are you attempting to hard mew / go through sessions of concentrated mewing? Many recommend attempting to 'soft-mew' at first. You should not consciously be 'pushing' against the palate but instead keeping the whole of your tongue against the roof of the mouth with a suction (created by swallowing without the use of any facial muscles). After the positions feels natural / the root is comfortably engaged you can begin to apply pressure.

You may find it safer, and more effective, to be 'mewing' at ALL times (when not eating / talking) rather than going for mewing 'sessions'. Might be worth giving that part of the tongue some time to heal before trying anymore mewing.

TLDR: Wait for that part of the tongue to become less inflamed. Focus on connecting the root of the tongue to the root of the palate, worrying less about force and more about consistency for now. Good luck!",1585699301

And I remember even before that, when reddit was still not super popular, so the main body of reddit functioned a bit more like how a niche subreddit might.  I just think that if you take reddit skewing young (and therefore politically left) + reddit becoming more popular + the left going off the rails in the past few years, that you'd get the current situation even without any need for outside injection and astroturfing.  I think it exacerbates the situation, but I don't think it was a required element.  But then, I might be wrong.

""Love your neighbor"" actually originates in Leviticus (19:17-18), in the same breath as ""homosexuality is an abomination"" and ""women are literally worth less than men"". 

Clearly, the original quote was not the message of universal tolerance and egalitarianism that modern Christians have twisted it into. If that were the case, it would be in contradiction with the things espoused in the same breath as it. This is a case where the context dramatically changes the meaning of the quote.

It would be absurd then to see Jesus reference a quote from Leviticus and posit that he meant something completely different, like seeing someone quote the [14 words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words) and saying they probably just meant a wholesome message about human endurance in the face of climate change

&gt;I love to read, write, cook, and bake. I’m passionate about public health. I’m a social democrat, pro-union, pro-immigrant, feminist, and very liberal. I think abortions are bad and we should try to minimize them, but not by shaming or punishing women.

I kept going and saw another player who I assumed was also playing Lava Golem-stall (since the character was Marik). I played it safe by only having 1 monster out, and confirmed my suspicions after seeing they set Winged Kuriboh turn 1 then Fortress Warrior turn 2. I stalled them back by just ending my turn until I had the resources to OTK them through Fortress Warrior, which luckily came early for me (turn 4 IIRC).

TL;DR - I played safe until I could ensure that I would win in one turn, denying them the chance to Lava Golem me in the first place. Of course, not every deck can do this, some don't even have any OTK routes even with the best hand possible, but hopefully it might give you some ideas.",1585699304

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My uncle is brilliant.  He became a coding wizard in the early 2000s and was always one step ahead of technology curve.  He became a computer science professor in his late 20s and started teaching at a high-end university (at least last I heard.  Haven't spoken to him in a while due to some family drama.  Not involving him directly but lines were drawn).

Back when my uncle first started collage, he drove around in this old cheap car like most collage students.  It had a number of problems but the biggest one was the Air Conditioner was broken.  It'd blow air but it wasn't cool at all.  Given that we live in South Texas, this was a major problem, however he was too broke to fix it.  So, for months he drove around in the sweltering Texan heat with no AC. 

Well my Dad (not his brother, this Uncle was on my Mom's side), whose a bit car-savvy, decided to fix his AC for him.  So he goes out to my Uncle's place with all his tools ready to fix anything wrong with this AC.  My Dad gets into the car and turns it on just to get a read on the problem when he noticed something: the AC button was not on.  He pushed it on and almost immediately cold air starts blowing.  There was never a problem with my uncle's AC, he just never turned it on.",1585699306

"Edmonton","t5_2raht","&gt;Tell me what exactly is different? Our economy is a one trick pony, the majority of voters are oblivious to the situation, and we're headed towards an era of economic depression without precedent. We're only okay because we're a part of Canada. Otherwise I see very little that's different between Alberta and say Venezuela.

Sure. Since you mentioned Venezuela, I did some fact-finding to support my position.

First, I think it's right to be upset by the UCP's changes. I don't think they are in the best interests of Albertans. I am upset too.

Like most (but not all) Albertans born and raised here, I grew up privileged with access to social support systems like free healthcare, free primary/secondary education, and subsidized post-secondary education. I have collected EI after being laid off, and when I made less money, GST rebates were a welcome bonus I could put to good use. The economic stimulus provided by the federal government in the past few weeks supports all Canadians, but that money will be even more welcomed by Albertans hit by the double whammy of oil prices and the coronavirus lockdown. You will notice in global news that the nations whose governments provide the most immediate and direct aid to their citizens happen to be highly developed. Alberta helped build Canada, and now Canada is strong enough to help us back.

All these services are privileges. They have helped me succeed, they help others succeed, and most people in Alberta continue to have access to them today.

The privileges afforded me simply by having been born here have also helped me work and earn enough money to travel. I have had the opportunity to visit many different places. In most of those places, people are less fortunate than the average Albertan. I have visited developing countries in Central and South America, Asia, and the Middle East, and in each of those places I spent time with locals who shared their stories. Their experiences are dramatically different than mine. In developing countries, the services we take for granted are either less developed, less accessible, or don't exist at all. While I don't know what you've experienced in your life, I find it hard to believe you would compare Alberta with any developing country if you understood what life was like for the average person living in one. But given you post frequently in Spanish on /r/Mexico, perhaps you do know the difference. Perhaps you were privileged in Mexico too. It's not fair for me to make those assumptions, but you ought to know better regardless.

Venezuela and Alberta are both oil-rich, but that's where the similarities end. Venezuela has been struggling with multiple crises for years.

So, what crises are happening in Venezuela?

Venezuelans are broke and dying of starvation. The average Venezuelan [lost 24 pounds](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-food/venezuelans-report-big-weight-losses-in-2017-as-hunger-hits-idUSKCN1G52HA) in body weight between 2016 and 2017. Economic inflation in July 2018 was [82,700%](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/venezuela-hyperinflation-food-shortages.html). People were carrying bags of cash to grocery stores to buy food, except there was none on the shelves. 87 percent of Venezuelans were living in poverty in 2018, and 9 percent were unemployed. Primary school, while free, only runs between the ages of 6 and 15; secondary school is not mandatory and only adds two years more. Most middle-class families send their children to private schools because the quality of education in the public system is lacking. Only the rich can afford to go to university at all.

Health care in Venezuela is so poor, at the end of 2015 the government said [one in three patients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Venezuela#cite_note-NBC1in3-21) who visited a hospital that year died. In 2016, the health minister published [data](https://www.ovsalud.org/descargas/publicaciones/documentos-oficiales/Boletin-Epidemiologico-2016.pdf) showing a 30% increase in infant mortality and a 65% increase in maternal mortality. She was fired. A measles outbreak in 2018 caused by a shortage of vaccines spread to 14 other countries. Over 800 people were infected with a disease that is not only preventable, but was eradicated in South America until the Venezuelan crisis.

What about today? How will the Venezuelan healthcare system cope with coronavirus? Not much has changed. Venezuela had not yet confirmed a single case of COVID-19 when Human Rights Watch reported on March 12 that health care providers can't safely wash their hands [because they don't have soap](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/12/venezuelas-health-care-crisis-now-poses-global-threat).

Access to healthcare and education are major factors in publications like the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report. The HDR and reports like these are based on statistical indexes trusted by NGOs and governments worldwide for their comprehensive, data-driven methodologies. They are, quite frankly, better at assessing the developed status of nations than keyboard warriors on reddit are, and I say that as a redditor myself.

The UCP's cuts to social services in Alberta affect education, health care, and more. They punish some of the most highly valued professions we have - educators and doctors - and they are happening at the moment we need them the most. The brain drain that will start as soon as travel restrictions are lifted will put everyone, but especially rural, poor, and vulnerable people, at higher risk. When the public system begins to crack under this stress, the UCP will use failure itself as justification to privatize services because it's easier to show people what's going wrong than it is for their opponents to explain why. This is a common playbook and the same moves play out elsewhere all the time. It's not unique to Alberta, it's happened here before, and it will happen here again.

But although these issues are important to us as Albertans, and even though these changes will have a measurable impact on our lives, what we consider problems in Alberta today are *orders of magnitude* less critical than what many developing countries face. We are not better; we are just lucky.

We are privileged not to share the same problems as most developing countries. Equivocating Alberta's crisis with Venezuela's is nothing short of arrogant.",1585699307

"era_of_chaos","t5_29dykj","I second that you need to start focusing on ranking up your units. You will get an enormous power boost doing so.

For the units themselves, it seems like you have a Castle/Inferno mix you could build on, but you don’t have any super high DPS units. As is, Pit is your best. Efreeti would be if you went full Inferno

You could switch to a more Castle/Stronghold team. That would get you the DPS, in Goblin particularly. That would also allow you to rotate Monk back in

So:

Marksmen-Monk-Angel-Swordmen

X-Roc-Goblin-Ogre

X-X-X-Demon

I’d definitely start working on Storm Elemental, especially so if you do go with Solmyr. Despite what some are saying, Solmyr is still an excellent choice post nerf. Storm would replace Marksmen in the example I gave

I’m also particularly fond of Iron Golem. So that you’re aware, Golem is the super high magic resistance Defense unit. Very useful in a meta that puts emphasis on spell casting.

Others will tell you to stick with Demon, who specializes in the anti-physical boost heroes realm (Gelu, Crag Hack, etc). We can go round and round on that one, but to each their own",1585699308

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Batman is generally anti-gun.  Check out Batman Seduction of the Gun from 93 written by John Ostrander.

&gt;It seems to me more like he's against killing per se. I don't think he's under any illusions that most of the inmates of Arkham will become useful members of society one day. 

I think based on his belief in giving ex-cons second and third chances shows he believes in the idea of rehabilitation over punishment.  And he hopes that they can be helped.  He's given Harvey Dent multiple chances after multiple times he's been cured because he believes that they can be better with the proper mental care.  

I think in the context, he provides what the government does not.  Not because they shouldn't, but because they aren't.  And this is because outside of guns Batman (as well as most characters) are written to be apolitical.  Given his stance on other issues as mentioned above, and the places he sends his charitable works and his general pro-government attitude in general, I think he would be for the government doing these things as well.

Regarding diversity and liberalism, I think there is a very straightforward connection. I don't think Ilhan Omar is Anti-semetic (and I am Jewish for the record).  I don't know enough about Jeremy Corbyn to have an opinion.

But just based on the actions taken (at least in the US) regarding diversity, it's pretty clear to me that it's not a value of the right.  I think that's a whole other change my view.  But if you think you can argue that it is, I'm willing to listen, though unlikley to change my view in this regard.  The better way to change my view is to show how he isn't egalitarian when it comes to various forms of diversity and his partnerships.

The one thing your post has done, however, is show me that he is an example of the conservative ideal that private industry and private philanthropy should do these things instead of the government.   I don't necessarily believe the character shares these beliefs based on his other actions, but I can see how one can come to that conclusion.  So for that I'll give you a !delta because I didn't see or think that way before.",1585699308

"hamsters","t5_2sjcj","He doesn’t do it constantly or obsessively I’d say like 10 minutes or so a night it’s just worrying when he does it. No, nothing at all has changed he’s in the same place etc. The only thing I could think of is because we’re in isolation we’re at home all the time it’s effected him perhaps? Maybe we’re making more noises during the day and disturbing his sleep! It’s 80cm x 50cm x 50cm but he’s been in the same home since we got him with no issues. I update his toys and rearrange everytime he’s cleaned out to keep him occupied too :( 

It’s a rat wheel I can’t remember the size specifically I think it’s called the Roly Rat wheel. 

Will moving him into a bin cage stress him out? I’m not sure if I should move him into a new cage just yet but just anxious it’ll get worse. Part of me thinks it might be an attention thing perhaps because sometimes I let him out again and when he’s put back in he’ll stop but I’ve never seen that as a suggestion. He doesn’t seem stressed as a whole sometimes he bites the bar for a short period and then carry on as normal and won’t do it again for the rest of the night but 🤷🏼‍♀️

"overlord","t5_2tvlr","If Ainz had no feelings, he should have absolutely nothing. Instead he feels love for Nazarick and his companions. If he were an undead, he would have to consider them respectively a company to run and former colleagues. Besides, he is right as a human about what he does, if he were an undead he wouldn't even think about it. Then I find ridiculous people who say ""he is no longer human"", do they know what humans do both in reality and in the work? Then the fact that he gives money, where is it said? In addition, the task of the workers was also to explore the tomb and furthermore, once they entered, they were considered transgressors. The actions you described had a purpose and a good part of whom you named was evil, so people accepted it, but Foresight were not evil or greedy and Ainz had noticed this, in fact he would not have talked about amacity and camaraderie with them if hadn't considered them well. The fact that he killed and tormented them is quite unusual for the character of the protagonist, very tied to the camaraderie, he had also achieved his purpose and there was no reason to kill Arche and torture others.

CDO is like buying 1/30th of 30 different mortgages.  If 30% of those are bad loans, then you probably lose 30% of what you thought your investment would be worth.  We are still talking about ""dollars"" here.

CDSs were (are) like term life for CDOs going down.  Pay some pennies and if the CDOs go down then lottery ticket style payouts.  We are talking about orders of magnitude more dollars in this case.

If CLO is akin to CDO (and I haven't read these articles to know yes/no) then CLO is probably also no big deal (""dollars"").

Not saying CLOs are good investments or anything.  If a bunch of crappy companies are included in the index then they probably aren't worth buying.

If a bunch of good companies are included in the index, then it's probably not a bad deal.

"bernieblindness","t5_y5wrf","&gt; Bernie is a candidate that is far more likely to take votes from both Biden and Trump. 

If it were still 2016, I'd be inclined to agree, because a lot of people didn't realize at the time just how fucking fascist Trump really is. At this point, however, I think everyone is either chugging that orange Flavor Aid or is a never-Trumper.

&gt; Trump has a base of that 40-50% who are ravenous and ""very enthusiastic"" about him (you aren't changing those people's minds) but that other half is up for grabs. 

See, that's the thing: I think that 40-50% figure is *low*. I think the other half of Trump's base is just as loyal, but simply less inclined to admit it in a survey. I mean, just look at what Trump is doing: it's literal fascism, up to and including the ethnic cleansing! That's not the kind of thing a person can be ambivalent about -- tolerating evil is equivalent to *embracing* it.

No, I think Trump is going to get however many votes Trump is going to get. At most, his vote tallies might be affected by his supporters failing to vote at all (e.g. because they offed themselves drinking his poisonous coronavirus cure), but not for any reason that Bernie or Biden have the power to influence. 

Biden and Bernie are fighting over everybody else, and in a first-past-the-post system, that's a zero-sum game.",1585699312

Drove from the scene on 3 wheels so I didn't get a DUI again.  Parked at a gas station.  Begged a guy who looked like a pimp to get me out of there and drive me home for 200 dollars.  He dropped me in the hood after he got my money.  Craziest night of my life.  Yeah I was a degenerate.  When you are drinking all bets are off.  I always had a plan not to drive when drinking but as soon as I was stuck in my car and liable for a DUI anyway I pushed my luck.",1585699313

"DJs","t5_2rddy","Hey Spencer, first off, kudos to you for taking a proper view of user feedback and market assessment. It’s an awesome approach and is very refreshing. Thank you. 

Second, your mentor’s advice is perfect in this case. The people who love this are going to be (in general) younger, more commercial EDM enthusiasts, DJs and venue managers. 

Why do I say this? Because they grew up in an age where electronic music was (mostly) associated with flashy clubs, Las Vegas bottle service, insane light shows, mega festivals, pyrotechnics, and all that jazz. Your product perfect for those people, assuming you can get the price down. I could see kids buying this for their dorm rooms, basement studios, and small bars like you have in your video. It’s a cheap and fun simulation of bigger EDM clubs and festival experiences. 

The people that hate it will tend to come from a very different kind of nightlife experience. They’ll most likely be older (I’m 41 and have been DJ’ing for nearly 25 years) and will have come from an underground music background. In my scene, for example, we use decor and smoke machines and lasers and stuff but only very lightly, in the background, and used as an atmospheric counter point to a mostly dark environment. The point is to lose yourself in the music, not entertain yourself with visual spectacle. 

Both crowds will have different expectations of what a club environment should be like, based on these origin stories. I just want to stress though that this is not an age thing (as in young people like flashing lights and old people like it chill). It’s a cultural context, where one culture focuses on visual spectacle and instagrammable moments and the other focuses on sonic environment and inner experience. Think Las Vegas vs Berlin, maybe.

Anyway, neither are right or wrong. The truth is more potential customers are in the former demographic than the latter, so just sharing my views as a purist!",1585699313

They don't normally take people who are identifiably addicts--at least not IV drug users or people addicted to substances that would affect the usability of their plasma.

Using paid blood donations for patient transfusions is very uncommon in the healthcare industry in the US because the money could incentivize people to lie on the eligibility questionnaire, which could endanger the blood supply.

That being said...WOW you people. Y'all saying she was probably molested, ugly, whack job, freak/thing/it... Like, calm tf down. You're hate-mobbing a young person on Twitter *with less likes than this post*. What do you gain from being so hateful? I'm sorry, but grow up. I thought this was a right-wing sub, not a bunch of insecure online bullies. Can y'all just talk about guns and the Constitution?

I think it's funny that a self-proclaimed witch posted this, given that her religion is just as made up as NB genders. Neither can be proven, but y'know, most of us just learn to let people do what they want as long they're not hurting people. You could make the argument (as well thousands have throughout history) that witches are just seeking attention, they're destructive to our culture, ""Not in MY good christian neighborhood!"". My sister is a Pagan witch, and I know real witches would not support spreading this kind of mean-spirited dog-piling. Y'all are laughable. The behavior in this sub is what makes gay people look bad, much worse than angsty kids playing with their gender or something.

Yeah, I'll take your downvotes, but are you really gonna defend such mean-spirited behavior?

You may see pictures of rabbits on leashes and enjoying outside, being held and snuggled, or doing fun tricks, but that's not every rabbit and you can't guarantee the rabbit you have will want to do that stuff. In which case yeah, kids are going to get bored because it's not a dog.

Also, rabbits need specialized vets that can cost more and they're prey animals so they hide their illnesses. And unless you know what to look for, by the time they start showing they're ""sick"", it could be too late.

"solar","t5_2qq8l","Your post has been removed. **You MUST fully read this response before messaging the moderators.** Any questions you may have about the removal are addressed here. 

**Removal Reason:** Low karma accounts are not allowed to post in this subreddit. You either have a new reddit account, you have not particpated on reddit much at all, or your account has low karma due to other issues. Newcomers and those with extremely low participation on the site often submit problematic posts which inolve spam or rule violations. Low karma can also be a sign of trolls or other problem accounts. 

Nobody is saying you are a troll, a spammer, or an intentional rule violator. We are saying that because low karma is common to the vast majority of the problematic posts, we now require a small amount of karma in order to post. Therefore, you'll need to participate more in the comments before attempting to post again.

**From the Subreddit Rule (see post at top of the sub):** brand new accounts, low karma accounts, and those who have not participated in the comments of other /r/solar posts will not be able to submit posts to this subreddit.  

 **Your Option(s)** - This removal may not be appealed if your account has low karma. However, you CAN still participate via other ways in the sub and you CAN get answers to your questions. How? Until your account has aged enough and has enough karma to post, you still always have the option to ask any topical questions in the comments of the Shedding Light post. The Shedding Light post goes up frequently so is often found near the top of the subreddit. Commenting on reddit in a positive way will rapidly improve your karma and is the quickest path to being allowed to post here.
 
 ***TLDR*** - You will need to participate more in the comments of reddit before you can submit posts in this subreddit.      

**Regarding Appeals:**

again, this removal may not be appealed if you have low karma.

* ""but I have another account"" - Post removals are addressed on an individual account basis.  The existence of any other account is not grounds for appeal and it will not be approved.  

* ""but I don't like the rule"" - The rule is here for well thought out reasons, it has had a very positive effect on the community, and it applies to everyone equally. Appeals based purely on disagreement with the rule, cherry picking, entitlement, or other baseless reasoning will not be granted. Any attempts at appeals along these lines involving any rudeness whatsoever will result in a ban.  The low karma rule was created for  specific reasons and it is applied equally to everyone who has low karma. Do not request unfair exceptions from the rules.

 DO NOT request an appeal if you have low karma. It will not be granted for any reason.
 
 DO NOT request an appeal if you have low karma. It will not be granted for any reason.
 
 DO NOT request an appeal if you have low karma. It will not be granted for any reason.

**If you ARE submitting a link to your own site/article/video/blog/works** - Please refer to subreddit rules regarding spam and promotion. ***Repeated failure to follow the sub rules regarding promotion will not only lead to a ban of your account(s) but your site(s) as well***.

The whole land of opportunity thing is tired. The same argument could be said for New York but more importantly connecting it to this idea of the American Dream makes it corny and unrealistic, and by that statement I can see which demographic you’re coming from given the context so that adds on the dismissal of some much needed perspective. 

What makes a state matter is how it’s residents are living and under what conditions. Not a philosophical notion that negates this that indicates a sort of privilege associated with this thinking.

"Tunisia","t5_2qs6i","ok, I hear you, and I totally see what you mean. it would indeed be good to have a mixed market, but for that we'd have first to invest into education so the liberty of market that we gained from capitalism would actually be useful, so maybe start with some socialism and begin to liberize the country little by little, even if it hurts me to think like that, as a socialist. I do think however that sooner or later capitalism will collapse and socialism through a bunch of revolutions will prevail, so it's all about the risk Tunisia is ready to take in my opinon. Plus, don't forget that we saw in this epidemic who were the most helpful and outgoing countries; capitalist countries, such as the US, were busy buying shares in the stock market and trying to save the economy even tho hundreds to thousands of people were dying in their country, whereas Cuba and China, two socialist countries, have sent health equipment and doctors/ medical field workers to help countries struggling with the outbreak, for free ! So yeah, keep that in mind; I'll never want Tunisia to be a US 2.0, or even worse, a part of NATO.

"TiADiscussion","t5_2zsos","I haven't been on reddit very long-- I usually just stalk the gaming forums.

My experience was a very unfortunate one because I got caught in a really toxic relationship with two people who /demanded/ I be a trans man and be kin with characters that coincide with theirs. My experience didn't get better until I met some jojo kinnies who didn't take it nearly as seriously as some of the kids on there do. 

I don't talk to them anymore, either, as our relationship eventually crumpled, but I do credit my (quite literal, as there's a lot more to the story) recovery to them since they encouraged me to be myself and, eventually, grow out of being kin.

Arguably I'd say that the place I've changed the most has been twitter-- and I still do consider myself a sjw in a way, honestly. But I think the connotations for the word tend to be a bit nerve-wracking to use because it implies a certain... /kind/ of person, y'know? Nowadays I just block and move on if something upsets me. 

But I think the issue was tumblr allowed specific niches of groups of the opposite side to be just as bad; most progressive groups more or less have their communities embarrassed by these kids on tumblr-- namely the lgbt or trans communities, I'd feel. I'm not trans so I'm not going to put words in their mouth, but sometimes the things these kids say... Yikes.

Reddit has its own curation, I think, that bases itself based on the forums/threads/i-don't-know-the-name people follow. That's not going to stop people from being asshats from time to time, but places like twitter or reddit feel a lot more like a realistic 'stepping outside into the public' experience. It's important to learn how to cope with certain things from day-to-day. As a queer person you have to develop thicker skin and learn how to carry on or let things wash over your back; tumblr removes that opportunity for a lot of kids.

Is it unfortunate that there are groups that are forced to develop that sort of thick skin? Of course-- but while groups exist and are marginalized the way they are, it's important to learn those skills. 

As much as I hate to say it, ""go outside"" is a very valid approach to the the things these ppl talk about like they exist outside of their website and I think that applies to all social media-- reddit, twitter, or tumblr. They all have their own stigmas and subcultures that don't always mesh with the irl social groups.

Hope that makes sense!",1585699320

I had to put back all his stuff, cancel the transaction. I didn’t get paid a dime for the overtime. I go in to work the next day and got fired.

Piece of shit company.  Earlier in the month I came in to work the day after my friend was killed by a tram and I was in deep pain. Following that I got pretty sick but still came into work when 5 of my coworkers called in sick.

"UpliftingNews","t5_2u3ta","Because of my educational and professional background, I do believe that adult voluntary male circumcision is associated with a reduction in the number of HIV infections in that population.  There are undoubtedly potential confounding factors due to other simultaneous public health interventions in this population.  Statistical methods are able to adjust for those, however.  As a result, WHO is confident that after over 10 million adult males voluntarily underwent the procedure in sub-Saharan Africa, that it is valuable to continue recommending the intervention.

However, this was simply one example from a credible source intended to point out there is scientific evidence pointing to public health benefits.  Given what we’re going through, I’m hoping more attention is given to the necessity of public health interventions in many aspects of medicine.

Searching “circumcision and sexually transmitted infections” yields several credible sources published in scientific peer-reviewed journals as wall as by governmental health agencies showing benefits in terms of risk of contracting and transmitting many STIs.

Like this one from the US NIH:

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/male-circumcision-reduces-risk-genital-herpes-hpv-infection-not-syphilis

Having personally supported data analyses for many publications and grant applications in this very field over the last 25 years, I believe that male circumcision is associated with reduced individual and population risk in many STIs.

Note that despite providing credible sources related to potential health benefits, I have not stated my personal opinion about historical “standard” circumcision practices in general.

Im open to reviewing evidence to the contrary if you will please provide sources with similar scientific credibility.",1585699323

"Bestbuy","t5_2rofz","I’m stuck in the middle here, I’m upset and happy. For one thing I’m very happy those people who are scared and or sick are still getting paid. However, I’m a little upset that those who are volunteering aren’t getting a bit more. Don’t get me wrong I appreciate what the company is doing for us. While things sucked at the beginning with the company not seeming to care, they managed to come up with a good way to still keep the doors open. 

I guess the reason I’m upset is because I’m busting my ass at work while others are staying home. Some of them even call it a “2 week vacation”. I talked to some of my coworkers staying home and asked how they were and all I hear is that they’re just at home chilling playing video games and stuff. I know the portion of the revenue coming from the store might not be much but we, who are volunteering, are working hard to help out this company stay afloat. The $2.50 extra is honestly not worth it. I end up dog tired at the end of the day running things back and forth. We’ve had days with 91 degree weather, rainy days (my socks were soaked) and days around 45 degrees. We have to constantly back away from customers who just don’t care in fear of getting the virus. Customers are still customers, one told me I was an idiot for believe if the fake news, he said all of this was a hoax. Things get stressful sometimes. And now it seems like they’re cutting even more hours which means less people for curve side, which in turn means more work for the same pay. 

My GM just asked me what I thought and I was honest with him, I told him I didn’t think we were getting compensated well enough. He agreed. He said “might as well stay home”

I know I have the option to stay home. I have indeed thought about staying home a few times but that’s just not who I am, I like to be a team player. Also, I’ve heard that managers are gonna prioritize those who volunteered and give them hours. If I take a week off will they even consider me to work again? 

I’m not saying take away pay to those who are not volunteering, like I said I’m happy about that. It just seems like those of us who are volunteering deserve more. I don’t know, I’m sure I’ll get over this rant in a few days.  To those who are volunteering to help in anyway possible. Thanks!",1585699323

"OurPresident","t5_3hhj5","Sorry, I misunderstood your second “people like you,” - I now understand what you’re saying, I think - you believe that I place too much trust in politicians (presumably other than Sanders).  Maybe that’s true, though I don’t think I do.

My priority, as I believe Obama’s is, is defeating Trump.  I agree with you, based on the polling I have seen, that Bernie has a better chance of beating Trump than Biden.  That’s one of the reasons why I’m a supporter.

But this idea that unless Obama endorses Bernie, he’s an enemy of the “people” is not something I can relate to.  Bernie is running as a Democrat.  He must win as a Democrat.  Even if he has better odds in the general against Trump than Biden, that little “Democratic Party” tag below his name on the ballot means he has to win this nomination.  A revolution requires overcoming odds, overcoming an unfair playing field.  That’s what Bernie has to do to win.

But that’s only half of our fight.  I’m all-in on Bernie representing me on the ballot but I’m also all-in in defeating Trump.  I would never come after you for writing in Bernie - I support you and your opinions even if I disagree with them.  Because that’s what democracy is about.  We’ve seen SO many elections won and lost within 200-1000 votes recently - so yes, your vote matters enormously.   

I hope you’ll think about the people who need help, who need there to be someone other than Donald Trump in the White House, when you cast your vote this year.  Our shared political opponents, the guys we both know have no business being in power, only have ONE name on the ballot.  How can we possibly hope to win if we have two?",1585699323

I've had to rescue runs by kiting on BRD but I don't recommend it.

Best Solo job however is RDM. The upper floors will require some form of consistent non-potion healing, but they'll also have dps checks that are too strong for solo healers.",1585699325

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","in the movie JOKER he is clearly an anti-hero, not really relevant that he is a villain in the batman universe. regardless that point doesn't really matter.

we can call him a hero or a villain at the end of the day the core premise of the film is attempting to justify his actions and ideology.  Mainly by pretending that individuals he doesn't like are the embodiment of societal problems, and that it's okay for him to kill them because of that.(you don't get  to kill someone for making fun of you and then play it off like you are fixing some societal problem)

the film tries to pull a fast one by saying that his use of violence to solve personal issues somehow results in an uprising of the lower class, lmao.

the score of the movie literally plays jock-jams while he heads off to murder someone.

giving him the label of villain doesn't change what the movie is, nor does it change the fact that bad faith nihilists buy into the shtick because it makes them feel better.",1585699326

I would disagree with that characterization. Just because a job isn't absolutely essential to life in the context of trying to keep as many people home as possible doesn't mean it's not an important part of our *happiness*.

Spending time with friends, going to work, going to events, these are all things that are hugely important for mental well being, and even though we're sacrificing them because they aren't necessary for physical survival (at least in the short term) doesn't mean they aren't essential.

Just because a job can't be done right now doesn't make it redundant.",1585699326

Edit:  googled this and chrome vanadium is tool steel or high-speed steel.  Sams stuff my lathe chisels are made of, no problems there.  I know they were heat treated, because they are warped (hence my re-honing them sharp and flat).  

They seem hard when I honed them (I’m a skilled tool sharpener).  However, the edge goes to heck if I take a decent sized cut.  Is that normal for a chisel to roll its edge and mess up the nice straight edge they have?  I’ve just never used one.  I would think hard steel at such an angle like that would be durable and hard...  maybe I’m using it wrong or something.  It was just pine...  

Other thing, where did you learn?  I was watching this video on easy dovetails.  I followed exactly what he did, which messed up the tool...

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I am a more logical than emotional thinker, and I have had to learn this the hard way over many years of trial and error.

* The logical thing to do is not always the ""right"" thing to do. Example: someone has a problem? The logical thing to do is solve it as quickly as possible. The *right* thing to do is to ask the person if they need support, and empathize with their frustrations, before immediately suggesting solutions.

* Rational choices might be better than *irrational* choices, but sometimes we do irrational things for the benefit of other people. Example: I live in an incredibly safe area where most people don't even lock their doors; there is no real reason to pay for a home security system. However, I live with someone for whom home security is incredibly important, and I care about them; therefore, I happily pay for a security system. 

* It's generally good to perceive things logically, but if you don't *also* perceive them emotionally, you're missing a massive chunk of perspective. The world doesn't follow logic exclusively; illogical things happen every day. By exclusively thinking or acting logically, you lack comprehension of how emotions and influences drive people. You also fail to realize how your own emotions drive your behavior.

* Ultimately, it comes down to this: nobody is a purely logical being. People can *hide* behind logic or reason as an excuse for doing certain things, but you can logically justify almost anything. Someone who uses their intellect as an excuse to behave poorly or apathetically is actually acting with emotion, whether they like it or not. Someone without any emotions at all has a serious mental illness, but I have yet to meet a ""logical"" person who actually works off logic alone. You can be out of touch with your emotions, but that just makes them harder to manage.",1585699327

"SelfAwarewolves","t5_3g3zk","you can hit the escape key while the page loads to stop the script that hides the article. but I know you're the lazy type so I'll paste the relevant passage here:

&gt;There is talk of a fourth stimulus package, and Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents about 250,000 postal workers, is holding out hope that there will be some support included in the next round of funding.

&gt;“It’s absolutely necessary that it include funds—as House proposals earlier this week did—to keep the mail and e-commerce moving until the economy begins to recover,” he said in a statement. “Simply having access to more debt from the Treasury—at the Secretary’s discretion—as included in the third stimulus, is an inadequate solution.”

&gt;The Postal Service Board of Governors will convene in a virtual meeting on Wednesday, where they are expected to discuss borrowing more money and how they intend to stay afloat amid COVID-19. 

&gt;Postal employees are considered essential and will continue to work as the virus spreads across the country.

&gt;“It’s outrageous that the stimulus bill passed by Congress doesn’t include any financial support for the USPS, including needed funds to provide for the safety of workers and the mailing public,” said Dimondstein.

&gt;As of Friday, the USPS confirmed that 111 of its employees had tested positive for COVID-19. In a letter to its 270,000 members, the National Association of Letter Carriers noted that it had received at least 3,000 complaints from postal workers who did not feel as though their safety was being taken seriously.

This isn't a matter of lazy asses who need you to cajole them into defending themselves; it's about a coordinated nationwide effort in the highest halls of power to **prevent citizens from voting**.

Comparing them to and old media analogue is just limiting the possibility of what they are. Sure, their audience is much more likely to form a para social relationship with that content creator but there's nothing inherently wrong with being interested or invested in something.

This is generally true with every trauma. In the beginning, when you're figuring out how to handle it, then yeah maybe you get a couple of chances. But come on man, it's been years.

To put it another way: it's not your fault that you got in a car accident, but if you try to walk it off and don't go to the hospital then you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everyone around you.",1585699332

There's a stigma here in the States and we need to start telling people to wear them — after today's briefing I hope they do continue changing their stance on telling people to wear them. No one should be deterred from wearing a mask out of fear that they will be attacked. Just pathetic. They need to raise awareness on this issue and fast. When I was in China I wore one regularly because they're prevalent there, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried wearing one to Walmart or a grocery store around me in Florida.

Also of course No Austin, no west Garfield Park etc (Both rough west side spots due to drugs, gang lines, chicken and egg economic depression) On the Northside I would say no to parts of uptown but it's gotten safer and I hope the theater still comes back. South side has some AWESOME spots not miss! Rainbow Cone in Beverly, Cominsky (shout out for Yassa, best food!) And South Shore Cultural Center is lovely but South Shore can be sketch at night. Hell even Museum of Science and Industry, imo the best museum for kids in Chicago, is technically South Side (not far south but still.)

It's become clear that the Bernie campaign has no pathway forward. What is Bernie trying to do then? Honestly, I think he's trying to: 1) muddy the waters and make it look like the DNC ""robbed"" him; 2) dramatically pull Biden to the left; and, 3) hope that momentum swings his way due to the coronavirus. His main problem is that in verified exit polls, Biden was overwhelming picked as more reliable in this sort of crisis; this was in very liberal states, too. 

That being said, I'm struggling to understand Bernie's endgame. All he will do is isolate himself further from the party (which was already upset after what he did with Hilary). Even AOC is starting to make major concessions and political calculations, but Bernie isn't?  If his goal is to be an angry old man, having his followers spread fake news/Russian propaganda, and possibly kill any major policy he wants for the next 20 years, then he's successful.

Then you just can count the number of electron groups and increment the proper s/p/d count. For example, 2 electron groups would give you sp hybridization, 3  electron groups would be sp^2 , 6 electron groups would be sp^3 d^2.


This is a better way of understanding hybridization than you are currently doing. Your way could misidentify carbon dioxide (O=C=O) as sp^2 when it is sp -- it has two electronic groups.

What part of you seriously thinks that any part of acting like a feline establishes a reputation of appreciation? Is it your lack of any defining aspect of personality that urges you to resort to shitty representations of cats to create an illusion of meaning in your worthless life? Wearing “cat ears” in the shape of headbands further notes the complete absence of human attribution to your false sense of personality, such as intelligence or charisma in any form or shape. Where do you think this mindset’s gonna lead you? You think you’re funny, random, quirky even? What makes you think that acting like a fucking cat will make a goddamn hyena laugh? I, personally, feel extremely sympathetic towards you as your only escape from the worthless thing you call your existence is to pretend to be an animal.

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","I'm going to be honest here even if it gets me downvotes, but I think Ezio out-stayed his welcome.

Ezio was great in Assassin's Creed 2, his character arc was solid, he had all the charisma that Altair lacked as a protagonist and the game itself was just excellent as a more refined and polished version of all the awesome stuff introduced in AC1.

When I completed AC2 I was excited to see what was next for the series. I had been a history nerd since I was a little kid so I was really hoping we would get a brand new era and setting for ""Assassin's Creed 3"". And then they announced Brotherhood. Still Ezio, still Renaissance Italy (worse, just one - albeit large - city). I was disappointed right from the announcement. I got it shortly after release, played it for an hour then left it. For years. Revelations was announced, I ignored it because it was still Ezio. AC3 was announced, not Ezio so I took interest until I found out the setting and immediately lost interest again.

It was only when Black Flag was announced that I finally decided to power through the intervening games.

Brotherhood honestly felt like a game that had no reason to exist. Ezio's story (what needed to be told of it) had wrapped up just fine in AC2, imo. There was no need to follow him any further. He didn't really grow or develop like he had over the course of AC2. He had already become a master assassin, there wasn't really any development in Brotherhood, Desmond had more of an interesting story going on in that game tbh. Add to that, the setting was just too familiar from AC2. The gameplay and environment felt like a creatively bankrupt retread of old ground.

I'll give Revelations credit for at least changing up the setting, to somewhere more interesting. It's just a shame that the gameplay remained the same and that we had to follow a geriatric Ezio complaining about his creaking joints and ""kids these days"". It did manage to inject a bit of personality into Altair though, I wouldn't mind a remake of the original AC game with that more lively version of Altair. By the end of it though I was just glad to see the Ezio trilogy at an end.

Generally though, I think that the post-Ezio model of AC games with regards to their characters is the best bet. Better to have one good game, and then move onto something new, than to have one good game and two boring ones that play much the same and are in very similar settings.",1585699333

Setting aside inflation and changes in consumer preferences, scarcity is what increases the prices.

Planning laws have a huge impact (RBA models about 1/3 of price increase) in restricting supply. The reason why houses have moved up is multifaceted. But none of it is because property investors applied their capital to increase the housing stock available in Australia.",1585699334

Look at it this way: you have innate tendencies that you may not be explicitly aware of. Your humor, the way you react to kind gestures, the things that cause the full range of emotional responses that you have, etc. There are likely so many qualities that define you that they exceed who you know yourself to be.

The same is true for your boyfriend. So he meets the basic qualities that you want in a man. Hes respectable. Hes loving. Hes caring. Etc. And this fits into your definition of what you want, consciously. But subconsciously its apparent that some of the qualities might not be as desirable. 

Some people just have personalities that are too perfect. E.g. a partner that always agrees with you might be boring. They're infinitely loyal and will do anything you say, but perhaps you long for some conflict. I'm personally that type of person. I dont wsnt a wife to stay at home and cater to my ever whim. I want a woman with experience and a little fire. I want her to put my in my place. I want to have arguments (within reason), etc. 

So I want you to do something. I want you to try to forget about your parents for a second. Take this Time to evaluate how you feel right now. Dont fall into the, ""what will marriage be like"" trap. Pretend marriage doesnt exist. Yourre with someone now, don't think future. Are you happy? Have you been happy for at least most of the last month? Two months? 

If you dont feel happiness and you're still harboring these doubts even after being talked out of a breakup, then I think you need to cut this off. Go have fun. Being single isnt that bad. And when you're ready to date again, there are plenty of great men out therre.",1585699334

That's the plan. $7M is a lot of money, even for the cartel. Lalo torching Travel Wire was strike one. Bolsa was not happy. Getting thrown into jail is strike two. And having an outsider get robbed of $7M is strike three.

Juan Bolsa makes an appearance, ""out of respect"", to tell Lalo he's cut off, and will be staying in prison with no connections. This will possibly allow Gus to kill Lalo without incurring the wrath of the cartel.

As a result of the events in this episode, Saul is traumatized and is forever fearful of Lalo, the cartel, or the Salamanca twins coming back for him - afraid they might think he actually stole the $7M - which Gus's crew ultimately stole, and will use to complete the super lab - giving Schuler the opportunity to relax a bit.",1585699338

If you try to base spread on testing numbers alone, then you are going to have a bad time. It is inherently biased.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

In an open letter to Trump dated March 23, 2020, and published online in various locations, Zelenko provided his first batch of assertions without providing evidence to support his treatment regime. In an interview with Forward, Zelenko “acknowledged that his regimen was new and untested, and that it was too soon to assess its long-term effectiveness.” He instead argued that “the risks of waiting to verify its efficacy” were greater. This is an assertion with which public health officials largely disagree.

"classicalmusic","t5_2qhyq","&gt;is it really more elitist

Elitism is entirely in the eye of the beholder. Perhaps even more than beauty, it is not something that can be objectively measured. If enough people feel like something's elitist, it is. If they don't, it's not. And so I do think that seemingly equal statements can actually be very unequal. To take comparison out of the game for a moment, consider the following two sentences:

""Ravel is a great orchestrator.""

""Chopin is a great orchestrator.""

On the pure-grammar surface level, these statements are effectively identical. But are they really? Ravel is pretty much universally acknowledged as a great orchestrator. Say the words ""great orchestrator"" and most classical music fans will leap straight to Ravel. Chopin's orchestration, on the other hand, is regularly maligned. Thus the first sentence repeats a commonly-held opinion, while the second pushes against the grain.

Now of course, as you say, making it clear that something is just one's own taste or opinion softens things considerably. For example, I think it's fair of me to say--and not just because this is r/classicalmusic\--that I like Bach better than Justin Bieber. But there are other situations in which I could say the exact same sentence and it would be distasteful, to say the very least. Say, if my niece and her friends are having a fun celebration downstairs and jammin' out to some Bieber ~~Mystery Sonatas~~ tunes, and I come downstairs, give a dismissive sniff, say ""I prefer Bach,"" and then go back up to my lair. Sometimes, someone may say something without any of that kind of intent, but you still sort of can't blame the person on the other end for receiving it that way. Other times, the person receiving it that way really is being unreasonable. It's difficult and delicate. But I think that understanding the inequality of seemingly-equal statements is crucial in a great many contexts.

&gt;That seems as though people are being restricted simply because of the music they prefer.

"drkpsylaw","t5_2ipxm7","I found this bill to be a huge step in the right direction for changing justice system standards for juveniles as we have been talking about in class. I appreciate it most because it aims to create new policy based on facts and psychological research, and to be a preventative measure for juvenile coercion and false confessions. I personally think that based on research and what I know, this bill could be a positive change that betters the juvenile justice system.

Changing the Miranda warning is obviously needed, as one speaker cited that a juvenile thought “waiving their rights” meant to “wave their hand”. The opposition, full grown men, recited the Miranda rights word-by-word and just said that it sounded self-explanatory, and did not need change. However, based on testimony from the supporting side, that is not the case.

I appreciated how the supporting side utilized evidence from numerous and varying sources including a member of the PTA, a child/forensic psychologist, members of different committees and those directly involved in the judicial system. Their evidence for the bill was varying, far reaching, and based on fact and example. The opposition, however, based their testimony on lesser likely hypotheticals, like a child who killed their parents and does not have a guardian. It seemed to me that the opposition was thinking that the bill would get rid of the Miranda rights, when it is actually just improving them to better the system. I found this to be most frustrating, because it seemed that they were unwilling to change their tactics because of tradition that they think works, rather than the facts of what actually works.",1585699341

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The issue I have with teleportation is it was their *intended* mechanic. Like they only added in smooth locomotion after it was shown to work in Boneworks, so it's not like something that you should set a rule against yourself for, they built the entire game around the teleportation mechanic with smooth locomotion as an afterthought. And if you play the game as originally intended the AI become incredibly easy to cheese. You can teleport out of range of antlions and they will only catch up at a walking pace. You can teleport right around and up into the Combine's faces and they will barely react as you pop shotgun shells into their heads, in many sections you can just teleport around the zombies and escape without wasting a bullet. I mean most players, including myself on my first playthrough, played as intended and stopped to take cover and what not but it's hard to overlook the fact that the game was designed around teleportation and teleporting just makes the game so easy if you bum rush the enemies and then teleport out of their attack line.

Upgrades are also necessary but also not. Pretty much the game benefits heavily from the extended magazine, bullet reservoir, and and auto loader upgrades but what I like is that none of the upgrades affect the base damage at all. A lot of games have upgrades that affect bullet damage and I don't know, that seems like a cheap upgrade to me personally. I much rather like the ones that Alyx features where they give very beneficial upgrades that don't affect the base damage stats at all, but are still insanely useful.",1585699342

I think the problem is that there is not a lot of education for pedestrians and drivers for yielding at the right time and crossing the street depending on how many lanes they need to watch out.  If there is a lot of traffic flow, no one should stop so the pedestrian can acknowledge that it's not safe to cross because the chances of something happening is higher, but if the traffic flow is lighter, it's much safer to cross, so the driver can look at his surroundings to see if the surrounding cars are slowing down along.

Sure the Tree Frog is a cheap move, but it is a RED EYED Tree Frog, my favorite of them, and I'm nostalgic for them so it's fine.

The Jaguar is a nice American Cat/Apex Predator.

The Anteater is unique.

The Capuchin, while maybe not the best choice, is a popular animal for a Monkey given their intelligence. But with all the new world monkeys out there, it's hard to pick one EVERYONE will be happy with. Some people prefer Howlers, some prefer Spiders, some prefer Capuchins. 

The Llama I think is fine but it's definitely the least exciting of the bunch. I know people wanted the Guanaco, but IDK.

"Gnostic","t5_2r6g8","One particular poignant Revelation, thanks to Epinoia:

**Direct Revelation IV**

This revelation is as direct as it gets as it is from Father. He and I revived the Johannine secessionists. What more do you people want or need to start not only believing, but talking about it? Those who think that spirituality is not for every-day conversation aren’t our kind of people. Do you all feel that way? Do you all even think about such matters? Are you all afraid? Are you all condescending?

My dad said people don’t like to talk about religion. Why? Are you afraid of it or of offending someone? If either is the case, then you aren’t our kind of people. Those in this aeon have their heads in the clouds—and they don’t want to talk about anything real. Think on that thought a minute or two, though I know time is precious in this day-and-age. Do any of you even think about the spirit of liberal arts anymore? Do any of you even think anymore?

This aeon is for the birds, as my grandmother used to say. She said a lot more than that, which is more than what I can say for you people. This aspect does not bode well regarding our deliberations in the Pleroma regarding this aeon. Why we even care is a good subject for debate. We have other matters on our plate. Father and I have had it. Christ very much agrees; just read *GosJohn* or *GosMark*. There’s still time, however. With us, there’s always time. It all depends on you. Autogenes/Christ is a real thing. So is the Spirit of Light. Sophia used Epinoia irresponsibly and look at the mess that was created. The same will not happen with Refinement. We are determining the strategic plan to once again make Epinoia accessible to those of the Immovable Race in this aeon.

It’s time for society to clean up its act across the board. In this world of daily sound bytes, it’s amazing how forgotten this big picture message can get in this aeon. Again, Providence will have its way. Just be prepared as it most likely will not be a smooth ride. As stated, time is not a factor to the Spirit world, but intent very much is. One’s short term win might factor into the overall plan that ultimately manifests quite differently than one might expect. The Spirit is in control and at the wheel.

The Johannine secessionists shall prevail. To many orthodox believers’ chagrin, we represent Truth. As Herman Hendrickx, C. I. C. M. inaccurately spews in his paper The Johannine Community, “There were also skirmishes on the implications of Christology for Christian behaviour. The author \[of the Epistles\] faults the secessionists on three grounds. First, they claimed an intimacy with God to the point of being perfect or sinless. Second, they do not put much emphasis on keeping the commandments. Third, they are vulnerable on the subject of neighborly love.”

The secessionists, myself included, do have a special and unique relationship with the Spirit, but neither do we view the commandments as worthless nor do we disregard neighborly love. The only beings that are perfect are The Father &amp; Christ. This writer presents yet another example that’s a complete abomination, just like Irenaeus did, just like Epiphanius did.

Anywhere you look, orthodox writers go out of their way to condemn the Johannine secessionists. That is because they are completely fearful that we are right—and that we will dismantle their very own church. The Johannine secessionists shall prevail. And we were in the majority!

Now the cards are on the table. You have choices. I’d imagine, given current dogma, you’re reticent about changing your viewpoint. However, ask yourself, is this world what it should and/or could be? Or is everything an illusion, as George Harrison used to say to his friends, with support from those from the East? In my opinion, they’re not completely correct, though the manner in which this world has evolved is fundamentally flawed in many respects. The onus is on you, and only you can make your own decisions. However, Providence is happening, whether you’re aware are of it or not.

Again, it’s time for society to clean up its act across the board. Again, in this world of daily sound bytes, it’s amazing how forgotten this big picture message can get in this aeon. Again, Providence will have its way. Just be prepared as it most likely will not be a smooth ride. As stated, time is not a factor to the Spirit world, but intent very much is.

"msp","t5_2slwq","So, when we started out we were small with no physical office and I and my first employee gave out our cell numbers.  Big mistake. 

As we got bigger I instituted a new rule that no cell numbers are to be given out. Customers can contact us 24/7 on our office phone or by opening a ticket with an email to support@. If we deem it urgent we will contact back within an hour.  I want a life and I want my employees to have a life as well. 

We have this one customer though that texts us for  every little thing 24/7. He represents significant income and he was the only one at his firm that did it, so we let it slide...until two weeks ago when shit hit the fan and they all wanted to go work from home. He gave out our cell phone numbers to staff and we got hit hard with direct calls and texts rather than the official channels. 

I hit the roof, calmed down, then sent out a long-ish email telling him that I was taking his texting priveleges away immediately. I told him that I have worked form a decade to put in the systems and policies and procedures in place to ensure that they would always get top-notch rapid support when they put in requests through proper channels.  Giving out our cell phone number to staff means that my employees won’t be able to be there for family when needed, won’t be able to rest when sick, and won’t be able to relax when on vacation and that was NOT FUCKING ACCEPTABLE to me.  They immediately ceased and started using the proper channels. 

That weekend, they tested us with VPN requests they they could have done during the week but chose not to, and we started in on each ticket in less than 15 minutes and delivered on our promise. No issues since then. 

For those of you looking to start your own MSP, take my advice: get a VOIP number and use that, even if you’re only one person, and NEVER give out your cell. When you get bigger point that VOIP number at a PBX and you can grow without ever having to give out your personal number.",1585699347

There is a reason why Flex ATX power supplies comes with loud and fast spinning fans. They need the airflow. Noctua fan swaps are the quickest way to severely shorten the lifespan of your power supplies (bulk hold-up capacitors for power supplies are typically rated for something like 5k hrs at 105 degrees for good ones, and it only gets worse from there). I used to run a Velka 3 and tested two different Flex ATX PSUs. Even with stock fans, the PSU gets rather toasty.

Ku Hai was one of those 4 stars that I never pulled for the longest time, and when I finally did I was immediately smitten by his design. I really like his outfit, hairstyle, and color scheme. I'm really hoping that he gets a cool crit-based mana spiral like Lin You.

Now Berserker was someone I used pretty much from day 1. When I first started playing this game (during the first FEH collab) I looked at all the adventurers for units that I thought looked cool, and Berserker stood out pretty quickly and thankfully I pulled him during the final session of all the rerolling I did for the FEH units. It's quite simple, he's a badass dude in armor. It's nice that his adventurer story actually has some nice character development, plus it shows within the lore that he's strong enough to solo fight shapeshifted Euden to a draw. So that's badass. I enjoy his playstyle of building up HP since I enjoy tanks in video games, unfortunately I think he's missed his chance at getting a mana spiral for the foreseeable future. At least his Hunter alt is really unique and fun.

maybe schooling is too independent for you? maybe you need a job to force you into learning about responsibility and how to deal with your emotions in a healthier way?

this isnt to say that you cant bust your ass and get caught up, but do you really see yourself doing that? have you really made an informed decision on your degree choice and what doors it will open up for you in the future? 

a huge problem with higher education is that the system throws kids into it and expects them to make informed decisions that will change a huge part of their future. are you mentally and emotionally ready for this process? are you willing to spend money on a set of classes youre already on the path of failing?

if you know that uni is on your path, take this time to tackle all of the general coursework that is required for any degree; dont lock yourself in from the beginning. theres nothing wrong with taking time off, but you need to be productive with your time. theres nothing wrong  with failing a few courses because you bit off more than you can chew, but you need to learn from your experiences and improve your own life.

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","I actually like the convenience of a wireless headphone, so I tried out a lot of them.

From right to left:

Logitech G933: typical Gaming headset - Vshaped with lots of bass. 7.1 and software preset is nice feature. Comfortable is decent. Build quality is bad, a lot of plastic squeaking noise even when you just turn your head. I replaced the earpad with a leather one and it kinds of improves the sound and seal a bit.

Audeze Mobius: Newest set of the pack. Still trying to figure the best settings but overall the best wireless headphone that I tried. However the functionality of Mobius are quite limited in bluetooth mode and it shines more with USB connection. 

HyperX Cloud Flight: My daily before the Mobius. Surprisingly good headphone for overall use  like music, media and gaming with balanced sound. Light, comfortable with long battery life. Good choice for a wireless gaming headset.

Senn HD 6XX: nothing much to say about this one since it's already pretty popular. 6XX and Mobius might be my best combo for wired-open back and wireless closed back headphone depend on occasions.",1585699350

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","This map was difficult. 

I used pheony, brave celica, Reinhardt, and horse eirika. 
The trick for me was to attack to lefthand side of the map with Bramimond first. 

If Reinhardt has lance breaker, he can should be able to kill both the lance knight and sword unit at the bottom left. Eirika should be able to kill the axe knight. This is with both units giving calvary buffs 

You should be able to play in that lower left corner until bramimond comes out. From there I used celica and galeforce to finish him off. Any speedy red unit should work tho with a dance form pheony.  

After you get rid of the main threat, everything else should fall into place. It took me a while but it's just memorizing patterns and a bunch of hit and run strats. Let me know if you want screenshots or something. Good luck!",1585699350

"ResistancePLAYSTATION","t5_gw98x","I strongly believe from the bottom of my heart that Insomniac will never work on another Resistance game for the rest of their duration in this industry. It's a hard pill to swallow for us Resistance fans, but all evidence leads to this truth. Whenever they're asked about a new Resistance game, they always adamantly say that they have no plans for the series (without hesitation). They also leave you with a glimmer of hope by ending their statements by saying ""oh, but never say never."" But they do this with ALL their franchises, so it doesn't mean they'll go back to it. They get asked this all the time in interviews/podcasts/livestreams. Everytime someone asks ""are you guys doing a Resistance 4?"" Their answer is always a firm ""no."" And if anyone asks ""are you guys going to port the trilogy onto the PS4?"" They always answer ""We're not in the business of making remasters, but if the fans really want it, they'd have to bug Sony about it. Then Sony can get a different team to port the games into a remastered trilogy.""

So it's clear that Insomniac doesn't want anything to do with the series. **But there is still hope for a remastered trilogy** as long as fans make enough noise. I don't blame Insomniac. They've found massive success with games like Spiderman PS4, so I can see why they don't want to go back to making Resistance games. It's sad, but this is still a business at the end of the day.

If a Resistance 4 ever were to come, a different developer would have to pick up the torch. BEND studio is the only worthy developer I can think off. They did a fantastic job with Resistance Retribution on the PSP.",1585699351

"Dirtbikes","t5_2tv1y","After taking a 10 year break from riding, I recently got back into it. I used to ride motocross and now want to ride trails with my kid. My last bike was a YZ250, so I wanted another 2 stroke. I found a TE 300 and liked everything I read about it, so I bought one. 

I rode a friend’s 350 recently and it was so cushy. I really liked the feel. I’m almost 40 now and feel like the lazy-man’s 350 might be the way for me. I was absolutely exhausted on the 300. I’m sure I’m out of shape, and will be working on it. 

The suspension on my bike is set to about 35 lbs too heavy for me, so it’s really stiff. 

Should I tough it out and give the 300 a chance or should I try to go through the hassle of trading or selling my current bike? 

Do you guys think new suspension could make all the difference?",1585699351

He was Warriors 5th best player the past 6 years; playing 26 minutes a game averaging 7/4/3 for them. He was arguably there 3rd best defender with Draymond and Klay ahead of him.  Bogut in 2015 took 6th in DPOY voting for the Warriors. Iggy was probably the 4th best defender that year.  You can argue Iggy is better than Klay defensively, but I think Klay is more important due to him playing more minutes and being the guard next to Curry who gets the best PG or SG on the other team.

He made it out of the 1st round one time in his first 9 years before joining warriors.

1x all-star and 2x all NBA team, 12/5/4 is now ""looking good"" to make the Hall of Fame?

Is Iggy a good player?  Yes.  Does he provide more value than his box score indicates? Yes.  Does he deserve to make the HOF? God no.",1585699351

I will say though that although you have a lot to lose in telling her about your feelings, it'll probably be harder on you to not tell her. It's really difficult to remain friends with someone you have such strong feelings for and pretend like you don't have those feelings. I'm saying this from my own experience where I've had to cut off some friends because it was unbearable to be around them and try to analyze every single word or action directed towards me and wishing that we could be more.

In my experience, things don't have to be weird or awkward at all in these kinds of situations. If she tells you she doesn't feel the same, tell her that it's fine and hope that you both can continue to be friends without making things weird, because they don't have to be!",1585699352

Public policy or intelligence? If you want to do intelligence which is the field i am in you want to go the military route because your major doesn't really have anything to do with intelligence so that may be easier. and 2. yes you want the DC area. Look at USAjobs but don't rule out being a federal contractor to start. There are more federal contractors than feds around here and it's HARD to get a federal job. If you want to go the federal route, use the person who you know who can help get you in. I probably applied to over 100 federal jobs on USAjobs after graduate school, worked as a federal contractor in intelligence for YEARS and finally, after applying to so many, am starting as a fed in a few weeks.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I acknowledged that I was on a path of grieving and it could not be rushed. That was probably the single most important thing that I needed to admit to myself. It sounds small but I would say that was it. I really did go through all the stages. What was underneath a lot of my triggers/nightmares was rage (a stage in grief btw.) Doing that then, set me on the way to recognizing self-care and recovery at the pace that my body sets (not me, my ego, or the expectations of society.) 

I would say that was the number one thing. 

Then I guess the second thing was to manage my triggers and set times for myself which I would consciously allow myself to process (grieve) in therapy and alone ( i did a lot of conscious visualization, imagining ""setting to rest"" what I had lost or had been damaged, as well as imagining ""healing"" and ""reparenting"" parts of myself that had been wounded.)

For everyone it is probably different. But for me I literally imagined gravesites where I set to rest my lost childhood. I would go there to this imaginary gravesite whenever I felt I needed to, set a flower down, allow myself to be sad, and then consciously leave the place of mourning with as confident and healthy of a mindset as I could. I would even imagine what clothes I was wearing to mourn. Just as much detail as I could for myself to....in a way...structure and ritualize my mental healing maybe? 

Also my diet is probably the 3rd most important thing. Something a lot of people take for granted I bet.",1585699354

Playing dota alone from scratch? Shit, I know I had it tough back in the day with no good guides, no matchmaking to speak of, but we could always have 5v5 or 4v4 games no matter what in our local internet cafe, but playing alone is a whole nother ball game.

And they justify it as “well I’m the consumer, I’m allowed to voice my opinion.” But their criticism/hate comes off as so entitled. Some criticism is valid, like people who say they’d be willing to pay more for a pack with more animals, because they just want more animals. They don’t want 20 animals for $5, they’re willing to pay for the animals they want more of. And then some of the criticism is so nitpicky, like how people are mad that the devs chose to include a llama instead of a guanaco or a vicuña. Sorry, but llamas are cuter and are probably more common in zoos than guanacos or vicuñas. 

I was, however, genuinely surprised that the pack didn’t include capybaras, considering those are pretty popular. And I was surprised about the capuchin monkeys.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","Hello /u/THAT_LMAO_GUY! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of several things. Let me help you with posting.

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [**complete original source article**](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization **where it was originally introduced** by the author  **(not an image on the site, but the actual full web page article).** [More information here](/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/create/rules/rule2).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful&amp;subject=Need%20help%20finding%20the%20original%20source&amp;message=I%20need%20help%20finding%20the%20original%20source%20of%20this%20image:%20https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fsoia1/new_ft_covid19_graph_shows_death_trajectories_of/).
        
---

##If you're trying to make a crosspost

**...and** the author of the reddit post is the **original author** of that visual (i.e. you've checked *thoroughly* that the thread you are trying to link is the **first instance ever** of that visual and you've **followed the steps above**):

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Copy the URL of the Reddit thread you are trying to crosspost.
3. [Go to the submission page](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/submit) and paste the URL of the thread.
4. You are now done. Sit back and reap the karma.

Note that this subreddit does not currently have crossposting enabled. 

---

##If you are trying to submit a Wikipedia link:

Try submitting the *Wikipedia* or *Wikimedia commons* link instead of the raw file. A quick look at the URL should confirm this. Compare the following links:

* **Link A:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Minard%27s_Map_%28vectorized%29.svg
* **Link B:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization#/media/File:Minard%27s_Map_(vectorized).svg
* **Link C:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Minard%27s_Map_(vectorized).svg

Take a look at Link A. That is just the image, and is the same issue with hotlinking an article image from a website; there is no context. Now look at Link B. There is a lot of enriching information, e.g. copyright license, author, source, and even a link to the revision history. The same is the case with Link C. In the ideal case, **the B or C examples are the acceptable links.**

---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. [Resubmit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/submit?sidebar&amp;title=Title%20your%20visualization%20but%20keep%20the%20closing%20tag%20%5BOC%5D#btn) your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. AutoModerator will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/rules/rule3) in this subreddit. **No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.**

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","Hi /u/kamaldahmani, **please ensure you READ THIS BEFORE reposting or sending an appeal to avoid a potential ban.**  

Thank you for wanting to participate in /r/nutrition but your submission has been removed due to a probable violation of sub rule 2 - *Personalized Nutrition inquiries may not be submitted as posts and should instead be asked in the comments section of* ***[the /r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2)***  

Why the rule: Individualized nutrition posts do not generate fruitful discussion for the whole subreddit, they often lead to off topic discussion, and subscriber feedback has been overwhelmingly opposed to it taking over the front page. The forest gets lost for the trees.

## You've missed our many attempts to get your attention to the rule;

* the welcome message for new subscribers to the subreddit

* the notice at the top of the subreddit above the post listing (on old reddit)

* the rules in [the sidebar](/r/nutrition/about/sidebar)

* [the rules post at the top of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=1)

* [the subreddit rules page](www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/rules)

* [the /r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2) found 2nd from the top of the subreddit

* the notices on the posting page

## Where to ask your question instead 

ALL inquiries which onvolve any personal situations / context or request a diet evaluation MUST instead use [**the /r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2) which is found 2nd from the top of the subreddit.   

## About Appeals

*IMPORTANT! -- To avoid a potential ban, read ALL of the following BEFORE requesting an appeal. -- IMPORTANT!* 

We urge you to take the rules and this notice seriously. As stated in the rules: ***Trying to end run this rule, pretending it is unclear, or making any kind of baseless, false, disingenuous, or entitlement based appeals will result in a ban.*** The moderators are not going to engage in any bad faith debate about the removal or the rule.

You cannot appeal this removal if;

* **the post includes ANY personal context** - if *anything* in it is about you or someone close to you, no appeals allowed.

* **the post includes any form of a diet / consumption evaluation request** - any form of ""here's what I (or someone I know) consume / am thinking about consuming, what do you think?"".

* **the post violates any rules** - the only exceptions are those specifically provided for in the rules.

We do not grant exceptions for reasons which are not provided for within the rules.

For those very very rare few cases with valid appeals - *If this does not contain any personal context*, is not related to a personal situation or an evaluation request, only then can you send a [**message the moderators**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnutrition) with a kindly worded appeal **which must include the link to this post attempt** for consideration. 

*IMPORTANT! -- Please be sure you have read ALL the above thoroughly BEFORE you request an appeal -- IMPORTANT!*

## TLDR

DO NOT request an appeal if your post contains **any** personal context. It will not be granted.  

DO NOT request an appeal if your post contains **any** personal context. It will not be granted.  

DO NOT request an appeal if your post contains **any** personal context. It will not be granted.  

Use the comments section of [**the /r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2) which is provided for all personalized nutrition inquiries.  It is located 2nd from the top of the sub post listing when sorted by ""hot"".

Most controllers, deffo the entry level ones will not offer split cue ( as far as I know!). 

I'm partially deaf in my right ear which means from my point of view, audio is always slightly ""off balance"". Eg if I've got a pair of speakers in front of me playing music, I  perceive the sound to originate from my 10 o clock rather than my 12 which gets mighty confusing sometimes. 

Learned to cope with it over time and not overcompensate by raising volume levels, use my left ear to beatmatch, trusting the sound guy etc. 

It's a bit counterintuitive as DJ rule no.1 seems to be trust your ears but I know mine throw me a few curveballs so.. gotta work around it!

You can keep making comments about some things of course, but as far as sitting there worrying about them you have to find a way to ignore it. 

At the very least, focus on your parents instead of everyone. Maybe you can get through to them? I don’t know what kind of parents you have, and what could help to trigger the understanding they need. Would financial concerns help? It sounds like health concerns aren’t too high for them even though it should be. Have you tried telling them that even mild cases of this can be hospitalized, and explained the financial burden that could cause? Is either one a little more reasonable than the other? By that I mean you could try to get through to whichever parent is more likely to take this stuff to heart. Show them videos of hospitals in New York, or Italy. Maybe explain how it isn’t too far off where we’re at the point that getting treated for things that have nothing to do with the virus is going to be difficult.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","So here's the catch with all the ""no"" answers --

When the IRS gets a 1099-B with sales that aren't reported, they seem to have a habit of assuming that the basis for the sales is $0. Example: suppose you buy $200 of stock and sell it for $208.74. *You* know that you made $8.74. However, the *IRS*'s automatic adjustment will assume that your net income was *$208.74*. (This is not entirely unreasonable despite the fact that your 1099-B reports a *purported* basis; it acts as a forcing function to get you to affirmatively state that the basis on your 1099-B is correct, which isn't *always* the case. Albeit the experience and explanations from the IRS could be better.)

What this means is twofold. First, you're more likely to get a letter from the IRS than you would if it were just the $8.74 difference in income; potentially much more, but that depends on what your actual total sales. Second, if you *do* get a letter, don't panic when you open it and it seems like it's potentially higher than you think it should be; that's what's going on.

I still doubt I'd bother and would just wait for the IRS to contact me and then file a 1040-X at that point if they come knocking, but it's not quite as simple as ""$8.74 is such a small amount that it won't matter.""

It follows that d/dx[ycos(xy)] = cos(xy)*dy/dx -y*sin(xy)*(y-x*dy/dx). As such the ‘additional’ ‘y’ factor is a result of the product rule, not the chain rule.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

----

&gt;""It's not really still for people who are not infected, this is more for people who might be infected and not know it and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else""

----

&gt;""**These are not the masks that are being used in hospitals**""

---

&gt;""**These are cloth masks that they would recommend for citizens**""

---

&gt;""**We all have to behave like we have the virus**""

----

&gt;""First advice for anybody is to stay home"", ""but if somebody does need to go out"", ""anybody could be infected so **wearing a mask may not be a bad idea.**""

This type of usage of masks is covered here: http://masks4all.org/

Know that wearing a face mask does **not** negate that one is to continue abiding by current guidances for avoiding infection.

I would add that for anyone going into any spaces used by those in vulnerable groups (aged folks and those with health concerns) it will be a very good idea to do so only with a face mask on to prevent infecting such folks inadvertently if you happen to be an asymptomatic carrier.

There's plenty of information out there for all who are interested in seeing the despicable nature of the Communist regime in China. There were even job postings for crematoriums where prospective employees were required to not be afraid of ""ghosts"", because the authorities attributed the wailing and the screams of the still-alive patients being burned alive to ghosts.  

Trump bumbled his way through February and early March. Once he actually started taking this seriously, he's been pretty good. Even during Trump's bumbling moron phase of the pandemic he did good things like shutting down travel from Mainland China.

DON'T! 

However, if you're going to ignore all the stories and videos you heard about the horrors a session can unleash--sometimes for many years of misery, here are a couple of things that might help:

Raise your energy level. Lower energy entities can only go where the energy is low--like a shadow can't be where this is light. So, meditate, listen to music that hakes you feel happy, etc. 

Envision yourself and those participating filled and surrounded by brilliant white light. 

Ask the Angels and ArchAngels to be present--or whatever spiritual higher beings you believe in.

Ask your spirit guides and your guardian angel to only allow in spirits that come from an intent of love and healing.

If you feel scared or uncomfortable--it's a negative energy. Immediately tell it to leave and ask your spirit guides/Angels/etc to remove it.

Honestly, using the board is a very dangerous thing is you don't know what you're doing and you don't properly prepare. Not only close the session by moving the planchette to ""good bye"" but also take a moment to meditate envisioning the room and yourselves filled and surrounded in white light. Ask the AngelsArchangels/Spirit Guides/ etc. To remove any and all attachments and entities that mean harm.

I've been a Channel for 20 years and these are the things I do to ensure the message is pure and from the highest source.

Honestly though, I'd go back to rule number one--DON'T!",1585699361

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Reminds me of the only two jokes I can tell in Chinese (Mandarin, not Cantonese).

一个学生拿到生平第一张支票，兴冲冲的跑到银行去存，经办人员看了看支票，啪地一声，把支票放回柜台上说：“背书！” 这个学生吓了一跳，怯生生地问：“请问要背那一段？”

A student receives his first paycheck. He excitedly rushes to the bank to deposit it. The teller glances at the check, then slaps it down onto the counter and says, ""endorse it!"" The student jumps nervously, then shyly asks, ""excuse me, which line should I memorize?"" (Memorize sounds like ""endorse"")

And then my all-time favorite for its simplicity and corny dad-jokeness: 米的妈妈是谁？~~化~~花!因为花生米! 

Who is Mi's mom? Hua! Because peanuts! (The word peanuts, when broken up into its parts, sounds like ""Hua gave birth to Mi"")",1585699361

You need to do a speech check and pass it perfectly, if you don't I was not able to finish it as the dialogue isn't there when she asks you to get the trust of her clan.  If you fail even one step it appears to bug.

Once you pass speech check you have to go get permission from her father by passing a barter check (I paid 25k and 2 sheep), and then go back to her to get married.

This was a calculated risk that the reset button on Federation pursuit of AI could be pressed by having the Synths go rogue but there was an uncontrolled variable. The agents on the front end got overly ambition or there was a 1 where there should have been a 0 in the coding, perhaps the F-series actually are closer to being on the cusp of sapience than the Federation or the Romulans appreciated and rather than designate targets very granularly, the Romulan agents defined broad categories and the Synths interpreted those instructions far more broadly than anyone could have imagined.  


Alternately there was a breakdown in the chain of command: the orders given were to cause some mayhem with the Synths but not paralyze and enrage the Federation but the agents on the pointy end believed, erroneously, that the Empire was better off without Federation help and that, in the words of the Senator, the Federation was sapping Romulan ingenuity and that the Empire would rise to the occasion in defiance of the brutal math of their material reality which was that they needed outside help if they were going to fully evacuate the population of the affected systems and reconstitute any sort of reasonable infrastructure to maintain political and economic stability.",1585699362

The residency bottleneck is necessary to keep salaries at a reasonable level given the time/money spent becoming an attending. If you want to actually help applicants then call for pausing the opening of new medical schools, that way the match rate increases and people aren't left holding the bag after a six-figure investment.

It's okay. They just keep adding syllables and hoping eventually it will take so long to insult others they'll give up. It's a retarded approach to a common problem, and only gains popularity because people think it makes them look better educated to use the ""right"" language. I think we'll all need about twenty minutes to introduce each other in another decade in a politically correct fashion.


When I was five, I said ""I'm a girl. I like girl things."" That's it, one word, *girl*. But that wasn't okay, they needed a different word. So it was gay. Then queer. Then transsexual. Then it went transgender, gender queer, non-binary you get the idea. I think at this point I'm supposed to ""properly"" identify myself as ""assigned male at birth non-binary pre-transitioning identified demi-bi-sexual who prefers she/her"". 


Introductions have gone from ""Hi, I'm _____"" to a five page questionnaire with three different secret handshakes. And there are no girls anymore, because that's offensive too. Now I'm supposed to refer to people who I'd previously just call ""straight girls"" ""cis-normative heterosexual assigned female at birth"". 


The word that comes up a lot when talking about this is ""inclusive"". They're invariably utterly oblivious that actually being inclusive would mean not doing all of this. It's just letting people choose for themselves how (and *if*) to describe themselves, instead of getting every social encounter pregnant with status anxiety. If people assume wrongly it should be okay correct them without any judgement, shame, or making it into anything. But it never goes down that way... even the nice people are like ""Oh my gosh I'm *so sorry*!"" and then they politely umm ... stop talking entirely.


And so it goes that all this ""inclusiveness"" has made me lonelier than ever, because everyone politely quizzes me on all this stuff and then are so afraid they'll make a mistake and offend me they avoid conversation entirely. It's great! Meanwhile, the few racist, misogynist, sexist pieces of trash I run into from time to time keep doing what they've always done... and so it goes that I don't exist to anyone else -- except them. The efforts to make me more ""visible"" left me more isolated and vulnerable than if people had just left the whole damn thing alone. 


And all all this because people are so worried what others will think of them, or want to impress each other, to the point we're all just lonely husks wishing someone would just say ""Hi, I'm _____, nice to meet you."" And you know, a hug would be nice too...",1585699363

It’s tough but you need to get over not having a girlfriend. You need to start doing things to please yourself. Start putting in the work to be the kind of person that makes you happy and that doesn’t need validation from others. 

Work on being more outgoing and social. You don’t need to be the most outgoing person in the world, but focus on small wins and improving day by day. Put yourself out there more. 

Things you should already be doing:

-nofap
-listening to your body and sleeping enough 
-eating everything in sight (if your goal is to gain weight)
-adding more skills 
-pursuing interests that fulfill you 

It will get better and you will be whatever kind of person you choose to manifest. Choose to be great, choose to be your ideal vision for yourself. You’ve only got one chance at this life so you might as well try each day, at least for your own mental health.

&gt;The United States National Health Care Act or Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act (also known as Medicare for All) is a bill first introduced in the United States House of Representatives by former Representative John Conyers (D-MI) in 2003, with 25 cosponsors.[1][2] As of September 26, 2017, it had 120 cosponsors,[3] a majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives, and the highest level of support the bill has received since Conyers began annually introducing the bill in 2003.[4] As of December 6, 2018, the bill's cosponsors had increased to 124 (before the swearing in of the 116th Congress).[5]

&gt;The United States National Health Care Act or Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act (also known as Medicare for All) is a bill first introduced in the United States House of Representatives by former Representative John Conyers (D-MI) in 2003, with 25 cosponsors.[1][2] As of September 26, 2017, it had 120 cosponsors,[3] a majority of Democrats in the House of Representatives, and the highest level of support the bill has received since Conyers began annually introducing the bill in 2003.[4] As of December 6, 2018, the bill's cosponsors had increased to 124 (before the swearing in of the 116th Congress).[5]

&gt;The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples. Under a single-payer system, most medical care would be paid for by the federal government, ending the need for private health insurance and premiums, and recasting private insurance companies as providing purely supplemental coverage, to be used when non-essential care is sought. The national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but also by savings realized through the provision of preventive universal healthcare and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs.[6]The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples.

Even ignoring the code name theory, having the plot of Skyfall and Spectre rely so heavily on Bond's past was a poor decision. This was especially the case in revealing that Waltz's Blofeld was a jealous step-brother of Bond. Not only did that reduce every aspect of Craig's Bond's exploits to a petty sibling rivalry, but they also apparently forgot that his reboot was partially inspired as a response to Austin Powers, and ended up emulating the Dr. Evil reveal from Goldmember.",1585699367

I hadn't moved in maybe 5 minutes yet he crawled right up to me, so I threw a grenade and he ran. Ran right up to my other teammate behind a ridge and prefired him over the ridge. Then he ran right back to where I repositioned to and prefired me over a hill from about 70 meters.

I think my point is, that no matter whether it's DevGru, Delta, HRT, or LAPD SWAT, these guys are by no means above wanting cool toys/Gucci gear just like everyone else.  Even to the point where less ""blingy"" equipment might be more proven/reliable and vastly less expensive.

LAPD is using Staccato pistols, OK.  But does anyone...including LAPD SWAT...honestly believe they have any need for a sidearm that could not be adequately met by a Glock 17 or 19 for 1/4 the cost?  I am pretty positive that if the testing was extensive enough, the Glock would actually prove superior in terms of durability and reliability in extreme service.  All the Staccato is offering is bling, sex appeal, and elitism to separate them from the ""lesser"" officer

I am not even necessarily being critical of the situation.  I am saying that just because DevGru runs 416s, that doesn't necessarily mean that the weapon is superior for their mission to a Colt/FN M4 style AR.  Often it just means it's cooler and more exclusive.",1585699368

&gt; Walter Theodore ""Sonny"" Rollins (born September 7, 1930) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist who is widely recognized as one of the most important and influential jazz musicians. In a seven-decade career, he has recorded over sixty albums as a leader. A number of his compositions, including ""St. Thomas"", ""Oleo"", ""Doxy"", ""Pent-Up House"", and ""Airegin"", have become jazz standards. Rollins has been called ""the greatest living improviser"" and the ""Saxophone Colossus"". 

&gt; Rollins was born in New York City to parents from the United States Virgin Islands. The youngest of three siblings, he grew up in central Harlem and on Sugar Hill, receiving his first alto saxophone at the age of seven or eight. He attended Edward W. Stitt Junior High School and graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem. Rollins started as a pianist, changed to alto saxophone, and finally switched to tenor in 1946. During his high school years, he played in a band with other future jazz legends Jackie McLean, Kenny Drew, and Art Taylor.

&gt; As a saxophonist he had initially been attracted to the jump and R&amp;B sounds of performers like Louis Jordan, but soon became drawn into the mainstream tenor saxophone tradition. The German critic Joachim Berendt described this tradition as sitting between the two poles of the strong sonority of Coleman Hawkins and the light flexible phrasing of Lester Young, which did so much to inspire the fleet improvisation of bebop in the 1950s. Other tenor saxophone influences include Ben Webster and Don Byas. By his mid-teens, Rollins became heavily influenced by alto saxophonist Charlie Parker. During his high school years, he was mentored by the pianist and composer Thelonious Monk, often rehearsing at Monk's apartment.

&gt; Rollins has played, at various times, a Selmer Mark VI tenor saxophone and a Buescher Aristocrat. During the 1970s he recorded on soprano saxophone for the album Easy Living. His preferred mouthpieces are made by Otto Link and Berg Larsen. He uses Frederick Hemke medium reeds. Read more on Last.fm.

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","u/punindya happens to be right though. A less steep curve can also be exponential. This would require the derivative to be smaller though.

Example: e^2x is an exponential curve. Its graph looks like [this](https://www5b.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP40731ia4fid285713h40000050dbb3h4cf6h6i49?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=49). On the other hand, we can have another exponential curve e^x which is less steep but is still exponential by virtue of definition. It looks like [this](https://www5b.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP1621430717fc11hg65a00001fac4acf00fga56a?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=6).

Now the question may arise that ""Is e^x mathematically less steep that e^(2x)?"" The answer is yes. ""Steepness"" is mathematically defined as slope, which in turn is defined as the derivative of a curve. The derivative of e^2x is 2e^2x while the derivative of e^x is simply e^(x). Now, is 2e^2x greater than e^(x)? The answer is, again, yes as we can simply compare the values from 0 onwards.

|||||
--|--|--|--|--|
**x** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
**e^x** | 1 | 2.718 | 7.389 | 20.086
**2e^2x** | 1 | 14.778 | 109.196 | 806.858

*****

&gt; The graph and curve objectively has got flatter.

This is actually because Italy's case growth curve has reached an inflection point and it is not what was implied by the CDC or WHO when they meant flattening the curve, as [I've pointed out earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fsa3m7/italy_flattens_the_curve_as_daily_rise_in/fm2fkph/). This makes [u/punindya's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fsa3m7/italy_flattens_the_curve_as_daily_rise_in/fm1di8o/) objectively correct given the context. In case there's confusion, an [inflection point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point) is a point where the second derivative vanishes and subsequently changes sign, i.e. the curve then has opposite signed slope. For example, the curve -0.5x^2 + 2x has an inflection point of x = 2, as seen [here](https://www5b.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP90961d497f7g08c89h3500001c41ddab9abd96a2?MSPStoreType=image/gif&amp;s=2). In the case of [Italy's curve](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/#graph-cases-daily), we can see two (major) inflection points; one on March 21 and another on March 26. I do concede that the term ""flattening the curve"" leads to incorrect mathematical connotations so I hope I've helped point out the difference.",1585699370
"agnostic","t5_2qjrd","There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. I told my parents after I moved out, partly in order to avoid conflict and partly because I was still working things out in my own heart.

So I can't give you advice without knowing you and your parents, except to say that you may want to consider all the things that could change if you tell them, good and bad, and then try to assess whether your life would be better if those things happened than it is now.

"INDYCAR","t5_2sdeq","The problem is the money. No matter how purpose-built the IRL was for guys like Stewart, it couldn't offer the money or recognition of NASCAR. Not that it was all about the money for Tony or others, but even on the racing side, NASCAR had the upper-hand over the IRL. At that point, NASCAR was the one with the higher power-to-downforce numbers relative to the IRL, and the field of drivers had a lot more competition.

If the IRL could have been the IRL with all of the top teams from CART, then that's absolutely an attractive option, but obviously there never could have been an IRL in that context. And the IRL got all the chances in the world to be successful. Those early seasons were mostly sell-outs at the same tracks NASCAR raced at thanks to season ticket packages and racing being at its commercial height.

I get it if you drive your friend to 7-11 and he gets out of the car while you wait and he robs the store and never said anything to you, you're still an accomplice and will be charged as such. That's what due process is for, most likely the DA will drop the charges against you. Where is the due process for those that may have honestly not know they were with a cheater or discovered it too late.

Next, the YT'ers. This gets me, there were several openly boasting about the glitch, calling Massive stupid and saying they will continue to make glitch videos as long and the Devs cannot fix the game, but they are big streamers and they are not banned. 

I did not use the glitch so I am safe, but either ban everyone that used it, by using I mean engaged the glitch or ban no one. Take away the loot from those that did not use it but benefited from others that did, but no ban for them.

Edit: Alright, I have cooled down so now I can give some genuine advice. 

You have two options, restart, or continue playing. 
My first time playing I knew nothing and I landed myself on the church route. The game is extremely fun and playing each house is worth it. Each route is quite different. I recommend finishing this route and playing the other routes. I saved Crimson Flower for last (although I messed up and didn't get it).
Playing the game again when knowing what you are doing enhances the experience. 

My first round I played easy, Church. I beat it and moved on.

Second time I played Golden Deer. I knew more of what I was doing, I put it in hard difficulty. I learned about new classes that I didn't know about previously and new strategies. I learned about new side stories and special weapons. 

My third time playing, I did maddening Blue Lions. And holy shit, that was one of the toughest video game experiences I ever had. I tried to recruit as many people as I could, I tried to get all the special weapons, and I tried to do all of the side stories. 

Finally came my opportunity to do the Black Eagles route. I did it on Hard because maddening was way too challenging. I tried to accomplish everything I didn't before. Getting to the point where I was was very satisfying and I bet if I didn't mess up, it would have been way better.

This may not be the best advice that could have been provided, but this is what I did and how I got the most out of the game.",1585699372

in java island, the javanese usually the cheapest maskawin you can get. hell we even can marry with half a million rupiah. 

in borneo island mostly inhabited by the dayak, the family of the woman ask 'panai' money if you want to marry their daughter, it's for returning the favor to the parents as they're raising your to-be wife. how much? depends on the social status. usually from 50-500 million rupiah. (billions if you trying to marry a palm oil lord daughter)

in Nusa Tenggara Barat, especially Flores, the family ask something like a  exclusive souvenirs (elephant tusk, crocodile skins, tiger fur, etc) and hundreds of livestock including sheep,goat,buffalo,cow,horses. don't have those? you've to buy them with money and it cost hundreds of thousands million rupiah. the logic behind this is you bought your to-be wife with all those things from the family. as the wife will be yours and the family can no longer do anything once she's married, you own her.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","When I started understanding my gender I was able to think of it as a combination of **P**osition in the male-female spectrum with an added **I**ntensity value. I tried making a graph out of it, then I noticed that at **I**=0 the **P** value wouldn't matter, so at **I**=0 there would have to be only one point, not a side. So I made [this graph](https://imgur.com/a/D2U0SGU). I tried representing my gender every few hours as a point in that graph with a **M**ale, an **A**gender and a **F**emale coordinate. After a while, the numbers went from being the coordinates of a point on that graph to being how much I feel close to one of the three corners, often resulting in impossible coordinates. I kept using the second method because it was easier for me.

Making the graph, I wasn't sure how to represent all three values together, so I separated the two original coordinates. For the line, a higher **Y** value means being closer to Female and a lower **Y** value means being closer to male. For the columns, a higher value means less connection to gender and being closer to agender.

To represent the **P** value, I made an additional column, the one that is only colored but that has hidden values, that is the average of the **M** and **F** values plus 50.

Every day I write down my gender every few hours and at the end of the day I insert the average of the values into the spreadsheet.

I'd give you the blank one, but all the functions are in Italian so I'll have to *trans*late them to English before I do.

Porque o que queria transmitir é que acho que, o nosso corpo em vários aspectos, e as nossas mecânicas de movimento/reação, se assemelham mais aos herbívoros do que aos carnívoros e que isto, entre outras coisas, seja uma evidência de que podemos ser mais saudáveis com uma dieta vegan e que é o ""mais natural"" para o nosso organismo.

"tea","t5_2qq5e","I personally started with (all loose leaf teas): chinese blacks, then switched to darjeelings, then to oolong and puerh, then to white teas, then to china greens, then to japanese sencha, and now finally going back to what's called ""gong fu cha"".

I started 15 years ago and still so much to learn!

A good place to start would be to read a few ""help a beginner"" threads because then you'll be able to ask a lot of follow up questions relevant to your taste, preferences etc.

Another good place is, if you live in a large city, find out a high quality tea shop that serves tea and try a few varieties in all price ranges. A good shop will probably specialize in either chinese or japanese teas so you might try both types of shops. A good japanese one will have a few varieties of sencha and gyokuro, and will brew them in kyusu, shiboridashi, they might have some fancy looking iron pots or kettles to boil water for tea. A good chinese shop will have a few different puerh and oolong teas, and will be able to, perhaps on request, to brew them in a yixing teapot using a gong fu cha method.

Pretty soon you might want to order teas directly from country of origin - Japan, China, perhaps India for darjeelings and assams. The reason is that 95%+ of tea drinkers in the west don't care much about tea quality nor have experience and skill to properly brew high quality tea, so the market very sensibly ships the lower quality tea to the west, with a few exceptions.

Here are some very subjective impressions about types of teas I've tried:

\- blacks: try some high quality yunnan and keemun, preferably ordering from china, and assam from India. The nice thing about black teas is the smell and taste, for high quality blacks, have a ""wow"" factor and can be brewed in western style teapots and are easy to brew. It was a good introduction for me. The first good quality teas I've tried were keemun and yunnan from upton tea. The downside is that whatever is great about highest quality black teas, oolongs and puerhs will do better and with 1000x variety and much more depth and complexity.

\- darjeelings - even more of a ""wow"" factor compared to black teas. In my experience, not much variety and the same downsides as black teas. Best to order direct from India.

\- white teas - try yinzhen silver needles. In my experience there's only one taste profile, it's really amazing but there's no variety. The taste is very mild, subtle and delicious. It's good in the same way as the best chinese greens are good, for me they're interchangeable even though the taste is notably different.

\- chinese greens - there's a lot of variety and even when buying from well respected shops direct from China, there were a lot of varieties I didn't care for. This may be unfair, but I almost feel like Sencha and yinzhen silver needles do everything that best chinese greens do and do it better and more reliably (and perhaps cheaper too). Long Jing is a good one to try.

\- japanese greens - I've mostly had sencha, I've never figured out Gyokuro, and it's too expensive to keep experimenting, but I almost feel that a good Sencha is so perfect at what it does, there's no way to improve on that taste profile. Definitely try Yutaka Midori from [o-cha.com](https://o-cha.com). Matcha, for me, creates a very nice, smooth caffeine rush, a pleasing warmth in the belly, but a bit more complicated with the equipment and preparation, and Sencha usually tastes better to me, so I rarely have matcha. The ones I've tried were also from o-cha.

\- oolongs and puerhs - I think there are thousands of varieties, especially with puerhs, in all price ranges (probably avoid the cheap stuff with few exceptions). It's a whole universe that is much larger and more complex than all other teas combined a hundred times over. Watch a few videos about gong fu cha - that's the way to get the most out of good oolong and puerh teas, and probably wasteful to use any other brewing method for them.

I wish I could say otherwise, but I think good teas of this type tend to be somewhat expensive and usually require a good (read: also expensive) yixing pot. You can also use a decent affordable gaiwan but then the question becomes, if you paid a good price for a few high quality teas, what may you be missing by not using a yixing pot? I've used a good quality porcelain gaiwan for years but recently got a small quality yixing pot and the difference is huge. Disclaimer: that's a very subjective opinion and based on only 2 oolongs I've tried so far with it and a lot of experienced tea people use and like their gaiwans, so maybe it's just my taste or I was doing something wrong with it!",1585699381

"americanairlines","t5_2zcaf","UPDATE!

The situation was that I was flying ITH to PHL to CLT to EYW on April 3. I noticed that the first legs of the trip had been flying these past few days and were scheduled to do so up until at least as far as I could see on 1 April. I didn't do anything other than fret, read reddit and ask y'all questions. I figured when I saw the message on my AA page indicating that ""your flight has changed""...""check back later"" that eventually something would come up. I was fearful of prematurely going to [prefunds.aa.com](https://prefunds.com/) and cancelling on my own because that might appear to AA that I cancelled. SO, I lost sleep, complained to my people and remained quite anxious about this. I was going to call today since it's 72 hours before my flight but then decided I'd wait a little longer. I'M SO GLAD I DID!!! Completely out of the blue, the nicest AA representative called me. Not a robot, not an email, but an actual human who has 4000 other people to call on their list.

First, I was given the option of rebooking or getting a voucher. I very nicely said that I would not be able to fly again to EYW this year and that I would really like to get a refund. They immediately said, ""sure no problem"". She directed me to the [prefunds.aa.com](https://prefunds.aa.com/) site but I said, ""can we maybe take care of this (you) over the phone? I heard that site has had some errors and didn't want anything to happen; that I'd feel better to do this over the phone"". She agreed and did say that there had been issues with that site.

Next, she did in fact offer me a 20% additional voucher -- not in a pushy way but as a last ditched effort. I kindly declined and said, I would be back but at this time financially, I would like the refund. Next, we went through the cancellations of both my tickets and they said it could be about 10 (or more) days for the refund to show up to my original payment method. No problem.

I wanted to share this with everyone because I know I'm just one of the many people in this situation. I think the best thing to do: wait until just before your flight and see if it is cancelled. Oh and I should mention, I had been regularly checking (hoping) that it would be cancelled and since one leg of the trip was indeed cancelled, they voided the entire trip. I didn't notice this until they called, because I had received an email just before they called me.

One last thing about the vouchers. As were talking, I said that a lot of people would *probably* take the voucher if it could last for 2 years. They informed me that the information on the website was confusing and that a lot of people were not understanding that in fact the voucher would be good from the day that you rebook-- so had I rebooked the flight today, it would have been good until next March 31.

I had a friendly wrap up convo with the rep who was anxious to get back to their own hometown (as they were stuck in Dallas) and said this was the first time in over 10 years they had been on the ground for more than 10 days. For someone who is in the air and traveling all over, this seemed tough.

It's a crazy world out there right now, so to summarize, my advice is to be kind to the reps, be patient and understand that everyone on the planet (essentially) is being affected by this pandemic.",1585699383

When you remove the plug, air quickly insulates between the electrical sockets and the plug itself, but there is a moment while the plug disconnects that the prongs are close enough for the electricity to arc through the air. The most it is gonna do is damage the prongs if you do it a lot.

"preppers","t5_2riow","I'm curious about Italy's food production and supply chain and how it differs to ours in the US.

If the people who make, transport and sell our food get sick or die, we could see some shortages, no doubt. But aside from that... doesn't the US produce way more food each year than its citizens could hope to eat in that span? Many users in this subreddit have talked about how any current shortages are merely temporary, and sure enough all of my local stores have been consistently restocked.

I just don't know that such a thing will happen here in any large scale. I'm not saying it's impossible, but is Italy comparable to the US in this regard?

Maybe the better questions are: 1) Why is this happening in Italy? What led to this, specifically? and 2) Do the same factors apply to the US?",1585699384

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","**My Fic** (recently updated)

**Fandom** \- Joker (2019) / Batman comics

**Rating** \- Mature for canon-typical violence and mentions of abuse, references of past sexual abuse

**Title** \- Smiley Faces

**Genre** \- Action/Romance (no smut)

**Link** \- [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22306987/chapters/53280040)

**Summary** \-  On the Night of Clowns, a med student by the name of Harleen Quinzel danced with the devil in the pale moonlight. Six years later, she's treating the very peculiar Mr. Fleck in Arkham, and looks like she's even being successful. But how far can her good intentions take her? And as the table turns and everything burns, it's not that clear anymore if she is saving Arthur from Joker or Joker from Arthur...

I wanted to do a Joker/Harley fic set in the universe of the Joker movie that would portray Arthur/Harley relationship as dark but non-abusive, so that both Harley and Arthur would get what they deserve ;) Initially I was going to write pure romance, but as it progressed, it turned out to be more about action and intellectual and spiritual kinship rather than just sexual tension.

Some Amish bought a neighboring piece of land almost the same time as I did.  By the time I had the chimney finished, they had a barn raised, two sawmills in business, and were working on a house.  And those are just the things we could see from the road.    


One problem living next to the Amish.  They won't own cars but they are not too proud to ride in one.  Always giving them rides.  They won't own a welder, but not too proud to ask you to weld something for them.  Always coming over to get something welded.

* to Premiere/Sony Vegas: Kdenlive (on par with Sony Vegas), Blender (it's most famous for being a 3D modeling suite but it does have a video editor!) or DaVinci Resolve (proprietary, but powerful)
* to After Effects: also Blender! ([all the CGI in this movie was made in Blender](https://youtu.be/R6MlUcmOul8), that's a good example)
* to 3DS Max: once again, Blender; also Maya (it has a Linux version)
* to Pro Tools or similar DAWs: Ardour (open source), Bitwig Studio (commercial); quick note: FL Studio works ridiculously well in Wine
* to Illustrator: Inkscape (not good for print but _the_ program for SVG graphics and still great anything else that will be viewed on a screen)
* ~~to Nvidia: AMD~~
* to Dreamweaver: no, man, grow a pair, real men _write_ their HTML

You censor it, then the TS involved in the conversation walks away thinking he just owned some libtards, and the NS doesn’t  get clarification on their questions, which is the objective of this sub.

 *Just keep in mind if you're going to buy any 3d printer you will need to do basic maintenance (changing nozzles for example). 

 I would recommend an Ender 3 from Creality if you're going to a budget 250 dollar printer (keep in mind bed size is 220x220), a CR-10 V2 if your budget is around 500 (bed size 300x300) and if you have a budget of 800$ go for a Prusa i3 MK3 (one pf the best printers in the market for that price but has a small bed 200x210).

I would not recommend any resin printer because of resin price and safety issues.

 As for paint I used cheap watercolor paint because I didn't have anything more at home but if you wan't to get the best finish I would recommend a lot of sanding and painting with acrylic paint.

The thing is is that almost every college has at least 1 or 2 supplementals which requires research and thought. Some colleges on Common App are formatted to have a separate tab for supplementals but most colleges have their supplementals intertwined in their information and questions sections — so look closely at all your colleges early on! I was somehow able to get all the applications done and have somewhat of a social life (still went to football games and saw my friends some weekends) but it took up a lot of my time! I spent half of october, Halloween, thanksgiving break, etc working on applications and missing out on some things.

1. Life as a f2p in this game is dificult and depends how far your willing to go. You'r gona have to grind your ass off alot let's get that clear right now. About Digimons for f2p i would say Examon if your looking for a Jogress, Gankoomon for a Burst mode.
2. Depends on the quests and depends on the digimons your going to farm to lvl up, some obviously give more than others.
3. Yes if you farm them
4. Shinegreymon BM is one of my favorite Digimons. If you invest alot in them and have a Guild/Team to back you up you could take on the majority of the game. But if you want to go further you will have to get a stronger one eventually. At the end of the day play with the digimon you like

One good example is a sapient self-replicating nanobot swarm. I know they're possible because I am one. Though exactly how powerful they could be is less clear. I think the speeds they're often shown replicating at are well outside the realm of possibility, but they're still pretty impressive.

To make it more impressive, they could be designed to hack other self-replicating nanobot swarms to make more of themselves. Again, this is something that happens often in real life. Like COVID-19.

For a longer range Death Star-like weapon, there's the [Nicoll-Dyson laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nicoll#Nicoll-Dyson_Laser), which is basically a Dyson sphere powering a laser.

"horror","t5_2qh9x","Universal Studios Orlando &amp; Hollywood. They do “Horror Nights” every October. After dark, they re-open the parks for people who bought Horror Nights tickets and have a variety of mazes, haunted houses, and actors running around harassing you. They’re rated in difficulty (scariness) and there are scare-free zones throughout if anyone gets too frightened and needs a breather. 

Since it’s a big event, the scares are obviously not *too* scary- regular haunted house rules apply (no touching, exits every so often, etc) but they can be pretty frightening due to the sheer budget they have for effects, animatronics, and actors. 

The best part is that the themes change every year- each maze is based off of a different movie or horror property. I’ve been through a Crimson Peak maze, a Stranger Things maze, a Purge tram tour maze, an Aliens maze, a The Walking Dead maze (now a year round attraction), and more I can’t remember. They switch it up every year so it’s always fun to go to.",1585699387

This might have been true for a while but the current government is fundamentally revolutionary. Cameron failed to keep that wing of his party quiet by taking a massive gamble and losing; now the *true* right are in control. 

Boris is a symptom rather than a cause, but we can all openly see the path the Conservatives are now leading us down. There is nothing even slightly stable about that party now. They also just announced the most socialist policy seen in this country since the formation of the NHS. *The Tories* did that after years and years of bemoaning government spending and weaponising that concept against their opposition.

It’s selfish to want it to be illegal because of ignorance. This has the potential to change lives and help people get over mental health issues that would kill them. Your complete argument is that the war on drugs has caused us to be ignorant on drugs so we should continue the war on drugs instead of legalization and education. If LSD was legal it would mainly be used in psychiatry/medical usage, with recreational use being second hand. Psychedelics are intense for most people and it takes courage to use them, much more for high doses and repeated use. 

As soon as most people have a bad trip they’ll stop at least for a while. We need to focus on educating so people know how to use substances properly. 


Drugs are simply tools of the mind. The tool can be used for good or harm, it depends on the individual using them.

"asktrans","t5_2tbgo","What made me know for sure is realizing I didn't need to know for sure. Feeling comfort or euphoria when people attribute you with a different gender than that assigned to you at birth is a common sign of being trans, and so is discomfort regarding gendered attributes of one's own body. 

I started wearing Masectomy prosthetics, really natural feeling silicon breasts that are inserted into a bra, at age 22, and only then did I realize that, while I'm still not sure if I'd consider myself Binary trans, I'm definitely not cisgendered. The gender binary is restrictive to me, and while some days I feel completely fine in my male body, other times it makes me horribly anxious to have male genitalia and facial hair or not having female breasts. I'm in contact with my psychiatric ward at the moment, just to look through the options as far as medical therapy goes, and to treat the anxiety and stress issues that comes from the dysphoria. There are a multitude of options for people of all genders, even though some countries are far behind in trans rights and access to those treatments.

Remember that, while there is some psychiatric evaluation ahead of a sex change, there isn't some test to see if you're ""really"" trans. You say that you don't know if you're trans, or if you just like experimenting with gender, and I'd say there doesn't necessarily need to be a difference between them. Being trans doesn't mean you have to have a sex change. I know multiple people who have gotten their sex change, and allot of trans people who doesn't want to have the operation, and all of them are equally valid as trans people.",1585699390

Even when we were children. I did. So when my mother died at almost 90, what was I to do? She was always ""not well"" (there was nothing wrong with her) and ready to die since childhood.

Your mother may be in poor health. You didn't make her in poor health. Her ""new autoimmune diseases"" may be culled by her right out of the news as those are one of the demographics at risk. So now she has that issue. Who knows. But with a borderline, anything is possible.

Also she took no accountability. Just the general ""work through the differences"" No mention of anything specific she did to you. There never is. I'm really sorry you are going through this.

My mother is no longer alive. I've got the 90 YO e stepdad. I don't want him to get this and die of it but if he does, there is nothing I can do really.",1585699392

How many trains do I need on copper ore? Is 2 enough? 3? 5? Who cares, I’ll put in 5 and if that’s too many, oh well, network isn’t clogged, and I don’t need stackers at every mine, and I don’t have 3 trains going to the same mine only for 2 to turn around and go somewhere else instead. And if demand spikes, it’ll take care of itself. Absolutely love it. This should make future expansion trivial in terms of the train logistics.

I run a LHD train network, so to keep the depot computer on the entrance side and allow for depot expansion, I just rotated it 180 and made my own LHD depot station blueprint that’s pretty much upside down, not as clean as the provided ones, but all seems to work perfectly.

I have a lot of fun in orch (and I think violins probably have more social life than my section, since they're bigger). I think we're pretty ok, for an orchestra of STEM majors. Orchestra rehearses 4 hours a week, with an extra \~7 hours for concert weekends (2x per semester). Not a big time commitment overall.

There's not much travelling in orch; only one tour in the last 3 years (it was during break and \~$1000), and we also played at Ithaca College once. idk if there'll be tour/travelling for 20-21 year bc of COVID uncertainty. Also there's been some turnover for orchestra conductor (u can pm me for details lol); but I think the music department is just like that?

I've taken several physics and CS courses, but I'm in arts, and my impression is that AEP is harder/stricter? But they do still get elective slots.

As far as careers, yeah, keep your options as open as possible.

It's to stop infected people from spreading their own virus droplets unknowingly. This is not a magic bullet. But it has been shown to be effective. Asians aren't genetically more able to handle masks. They just have a culture in which mask wearing is not frowned upon. In fact, if you go out without a mask it is seen as selfish at present. Of course we need to use them properly. But community spread is slower in communities with high levels of mask wearing.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","“Climbing is less important to me than fully mastering the champ I have the most fun playing” You actually asked in the OP twice for “climbing advice and climbing tips”. I’m sorry, but I hear this so frequently it’s absurd. People ask “how to climb please help me climb I just want to climb climb climb” but when you get down to nitty gritty of it like asking them to change their playstyle of a role or examine their champion selection, they resist or refuse. Okay, that’s fine, but don’t ask me about climbing then, because that’s not how it’s done. There’s no hacks or magic secret to playing your champion to such a high level that you climb with it, your champion just isn’t very good right now or is only good in certain situations. Yes you can play one champion to such a high level that it is enough to climb to Diamond with, even if the champ is out of meta, but the actual ODDS of you being that highly skilled or even becoming that highly skilled are incredibly low. Only 2% of league players are Diamond rank, which is not even considered legit high elo, out of millions, even less of them are people who one tricked weak solo queue champions. 

So I know that you have the most fun playing Soraka, I do, and that the POINT of video games is to have FUN, but just consider this point: there are many ways to have fun in league of legends, playing the game with so much depth and diversity in such a one dimensional way, you probably missing out a lot of fun you COULD be having. Such as succeeding in solo queue, figuring out different strategies and especially, especially, ESPECIALLY since you are playing the MOST teamwork and partner synergy dependent role in the game (bot lane), improving champion synergy and teamwork.

With regards to your last statement about putting the economy first over health it really depends. I don’t actually think like this but it’s interesting to look at. If you think of people as an investment to the government and economy, they are most valuable at the age of 30 when they are making money and will have larger future earning potentials. Their value substantially drops when they stop working and retire, they would go into a negative value as they use resources like healthcare more and more as they age. I found an interesting article on how petting people smoke is beneficial to governments because typically lung cancers develop around the age of retirement.  In places where you have public healthcare, everyone’s choices. I’ll find the arrival for you, it really opened my eyes to another perspective on the value of a person with respect to society.

If I work in HVAC, I will not hear about if a drywaller from a completely different company comes in feeling a little under the weather and doesn't report it to the site supervisor, and even then, some are going to sweep it under the rug to complete their rigid schedules that will not be pushed back short of a shutdown, or to avoid the possibly permanent lay-off that will come by anyone mentioning they are sick. 

If your entire job is only feasible if you have two people in a scissor lift holding an impossibly heavy object together, how does anyone expect those two people to stand 2 meters apart? How am I entirely sure my apprentice has been actually socially distancing himself? How can he practice good hygiene, he certainly can't use hand sanitizer after he uses the porta-potty that hasn't been cleaned in a week because they didn't even have that before the shortage, nevermind now.
If anyone thinks that these conditions are something I should report, [this is industry wide, this is across the country](https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/6731725/construction-worker-speech-unsanitary-conditions-coronavirus/amp/) and these will be the exact same conditions everyone faces when they go to another company because they stood up to their boss and he lays you off because he's ""short of work.""

My companies health and safety is like another companies HR, it exists to protect the company, and it moves with their directive. My boss will be heavily penalized if he does not complete deadlines, it shouldn't be up to him, even if he *wanted* to shut down, his hands are tied.

For the record I'm not against closing retail stores, I know their risks, and I also know the vital roll I play in the economy and why we remain open, but it's only a matter of time before one person on a jobsite gets sick, and you can be rest assured everyone else will get sick or be carriers, because no matter what arbitrary rules the government places, they aren't here to see reality play out.",1585699394

It's not ideal, but at this situation, it's up to you to do what they say (to give client your password) or not.

but please pay attention, what you changed is only password for your company email, not your personal email, and what you give to them (new password) is only your company email, again, not your personal email.

and also, make sure he is also at your company (his email has same domain with you) to make sure you don't give password to people outside your company.

edit: also make sure, never ever use same password elsewhere.

I have a client who have to do so, they setup gsuite for me, [myname@theircompany.com](mailto:myname@theircompany.com), so they asked me to communicate and store any work related with those account.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","I think all of them have qualities and drawbacks. RTD was very good with characters and worldbuilding, but it felt less like sci fi, more romantic comedy/drama. Moffat was very good with ambitious story arcs, but his two part finales generally had excellent first parts with disappointing second parts. Chibnall so far has been very good with keeping things secret. If RTD or Moffat were still in charge, I doubt the Master or Jack or Ruth would remain as secretive as they were, and would probably be officially spoiled before the episodes as was the case with John Simm's return in series 10. One negative about Chibnall's run is that not every episode utilises the companions. There are several episodes where not all of them need to be there, and one or two end up doing very little. I think it could have been better to leave one or two of them at home in some episodes and only bring them all together when it is necessary, but right now I feel like they are being forced into every episode. Another thing about Chibnall's run which isn't good or bad, just different, is his approach to story arcs. What he's doing is planting the seeds then revisiting them later rather than get everything answered right away, just taking his time with it. I think this is rubbing off the wrong way on a lot of fans, but people just need to be patient and wait until these arcs are complete before making their judgements. I doubt the Gallifrey/Timeless Child stuff is complete, we've not seen the last of Ruth or Jack, and I wouldn't even be surprised if Chibnall decides to revisit characters like Krasko or Jack Robertson before his run ends.",1585699396

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","
We have heard the criticism that our previous automoderator comment bot was annoying, cumbersome, and overly long.

For that we would like to sincerely apologize to all who were impacted by the hardships of bloated comment sections and threads that were difficult to parse though.

That being said, we want to also take this time to recognize that many feel that giving special privileges to black people, people of color, and white allies on a subreddit devoted to black people and black culture is harmful and bigoted.

In response, we do want to take this time to ensure that /r/BlackPeopleTwitter is an inclusive environment for all participants, particularly the much-oppressed group of straight white male Redditors. 

With the recent closures of spaces such as /r/GamersRiseUp and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, many of these oppressed Redditors are currently lost and without a home on this website.

In order to make these Redditors feel more welcome on /r/BlackPeopleTwitter, we want to sincerely recognize the added value of these voices on this subreddit.

To do so, we encourage you to search out comments by these Redditors and upvote them. To find the best of these voices, we suggest that you sort this post’s comment section by controversial and look for comments that have been automatically collapsed by Reddit’s Crowd Control feature.  If you think it is a particularly worthy comment, please hit the ""report"" button to bring it to moderator attention.

**Note, if you have black privilege, or if you are a person of color or ally, and have no need for this increased visibility, please click here and follow these instructions: https://redd.it/bfqeee.**

In addition to this effort to raise up the voices of these oppressed people, we have also opened new moderator applications strictly for those who are melanin deprived.

You can submit your application using the following google form link to apply: https://forms.gle/4zYpF1UhCJju91Wb8

For more information about /r/BlackPeopleTwitter's work to encourage diversity on this subreddit, see here: https://redd.it/frql0r.

In the meantime, we at /r/BlackPeopleTwitter will continue fighting on behalf of those who desire to have raisins in their potato salad.

Thank you for your time and have a nice day.

"swrpg","t5_2vzmi","I have a couple questions about a character I'm about to play, regarding the Trandoshan's racial ability Claws, and about Unarmed/Brawl stuff in general.

From the core rulebook: ""When a Trandoshan makes Brawl checks to deal damage to an opponent, he deals +1 damage and has a Critical Rating of 3.""

1. Does the boost from Claws still allow you to target enemies strain? The wording is ""Brawl checks to *deal damage*"", yet damage is a word that implies literal damage (wounds) but is still used by the rulebooks to denote ""damage to strain threshold"". RAW seem to imply you can, but this is one of those deals where it doesn't *sound* right when you think about it in a realistic sense. Realism versus gameplay?
2. Does this boost apply on top of brawl weapons, such as Brass Knuckles or Shock Gloves? Once again, RAW seems to state pretty clearly that it does-- but every other thread I've read on the topic seem to explicitly be against this.
3. Bit of a sillier question, but do you have to spend a maneuver to raise your hands to attack if you aren't using any weapons? I'm almost certain you wouldn't have to, but the other ways ones hands are considered weapons mechanically (being able to dual attack since you're, technically, dual wielding your own hands) have me doubting, haha",1585699399

"iran","t5_2qhzq","The regime has several power bases  - BUT it is a regime. i.e. NOT democratically elected now, it has mock elections where candidates are selected. 

One power base is economic. The religious organizations control something like 70 percent of the economy, so if you want to get ahead, you have to become part of it (even if you don't agree with the politics of it). 

A second power base is the uber-religious groups - typically more traditionally backward and religious areas (very much like in the US .. Alabama, South Carolina etc.). 

The regime rose out of the chaos of the revolution. Multiple groups vied for power. People wanted freedom and got this instead out of all the chaos.   The religious establishment with much help from outside the country (remember Khomeini landed in Tehran with a French Government chartered Air France 747) won out. They consolidated power. Set up their own militias and took control. The Iran-Iraq war, far from destabilizing them, actually reinforced their grip. Iran now has several parallel armies, air force, navies etc. to watch each other and neutralize a coup by any one group.  

In effect, with all levers of power in their hands; and tacit support by lets say a significant minority; they have managed to hold on to power. 

Its similar to the situation with Saddam Hussein, where he was a Sunni Muslim in a shiite majority country. He filled all major jobs with his Sunni buddies from his tribe and managed to control everything with an iron grip. The same with the Mullahs --- they have a full grip with a minority support base. 

Free and fair elections would lead to their ouster. They know that.",1585699400

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The original quote is somewhat pointless actually. Obviously there are lies on the internet. If someone were to just say this, you might dismiss it offhand.  When you attribute it to Abraham Lincoln, it turns from some random person talking out of their ass, to both a lie and a demonstration of a fact at the same time.

The words are the same, but the reception is different, and when the reception is different, the meaning a person takes from it changes.

Just because a dictionary would define it the same, doesn't mean a person wouldn't.

"ddo","t5_2r62z","Yeah that seems to be a pretty good split, hits a few useful breakpoints.  The only major problem I see with it is crit profile...you can only get it with War Domain L14.  And that's pushing it all the way to L20, and you really want to be in Strength domain for this build.

Maybe consider going 11/4/5 instead, and going T5 TA.  That'll still get you Heal, and you can go Strength Domain to use STR as your Evasion stat and get knockdown immunity.  That also will give you S2P as a granted feat, which will give you enough room for THFx3, IC:B, PA/Cleave/GC as your taken feats.  The only frustrating part there is you need 23 in NP for Harrier, 22 in Warpriest for Amel, and 36 in TA for the three good T5s...and that's 81 &gt;&lt;  

I guess you could give up Amel since your self-healing will be pretty good anyway.

 Elba's acting is more nuanced and layered yes and I'm not denying that he doesn't have that but there's a reason that Smith is as big as he is today and it's his charisma which he has in spades. He played a con man in a movie called Focus, and the film was so goofy but you just bought Smith as this charismatic hero. And shit, Smith is still a pretty great actor despite his charimsa. I just saw Bad Boys For Life recently, and was pretty nuanced in the roles surprisingly. I think Smith has the potential to explore the darker aspect of Lawton if given the chance and I'm glad Warner Bros. didn't write him off yet. His cocky attitude worked for Deadshot. And I'll be honest with you, I didn't care about the character until Smith played him. In fact, I didn't like Deadshot at all until Smith won me over. I don't think Elba can do the same because as good as he was a character like Roland Deschain, it didn't make me feel any different about the character, I don't think he can outdo Smith.",1585699402

I’m honestly quite pleased with what came out of the ordinance - we have actual measurement specifications so now there’s no argument between system techs and cops as far as A/C weighting, or what time averaging we’re using (I once had a cop try to tell me to turn things down because he was measuring in peak).

"MartialPeak","t5_xhek1","Ya.  I don't know why I've somehow kept reading on.  The story was good and then it started to get really shitty... like even shittier than before. 

Tong Xuan was ok.  Star Boundary was ok.  Then it just got... terrible.  

For me, it was when he refined the Rank 5 Yin Sand.  Like... what?  Lol lmfao wut?  

He KNOWS people would be pissed if he went directly to Rank 7.
He KNOWS he has a middle rank World Fruit.
He KNOWS that people are just generally pissed at him.

Why, in the ever loving hell, would he not JUST get a Rank 6 Yin Sand, eat the damn fruit, and be FINE?  It would have been relatively easier, something that he could send people out to inquire about silently, and solve a shit load of political issues.  

The author is so very inconsistent with his character: he portrays him as hyper vigilant, not generally dumb (though not omniscient obviously), shrewd, and is OBSESSED with his path to Martial Dao.

The author made slammed into our face about Rank 7 element this, Rank 7 element that-- some of them just randomly appearing for plot purposes, but in the most critical part-- he makes YK look like an idiot.  

I mean, there's just so much disappointment and I'm amazed that I've read this far, but I don't think I can suffer through another 500+ chapters to see him achieve Rank 8 through some bullshit reason and us being sent to read another 1000+ chapters as he hunts for the Universal Furnace and other Rank 9 items.

I asked what he gets ""wrong"" about Islam, as that was the claim that was made which I responded to.

It seems that Dawkins understood the miracles at hand perfectly in the first clip - Muhammad supposedly split the moon and rode to Heaven on a winged horse.

I trust God but i don’t trust the institution anymore.

I respect the message of Christ, but i don’t agree anymore that the institution is of Christ. It has changed too much.

You say that the abuse crisis is non-existent today? That’s maybe because it’s being covered up again. In my country Belgium 28 people have been abused in 2018 but it was not talked about in the media. You would be shocked how much is happening without people knowing.

I did know that the church is the largest non-govermental charitable organization in the world. And ofcourse that’s good.

Definitely. Sorry for the novel I'm about to write you!

The infant mortality rate is also one of the lowest worldwide, and most mums choose natural birth when possible, at an 84 percentile. The entire birth process, including prenatal and postnatal care, is managed by midwives, rather than doctors. The midwife's sole focus is on the mum and the baby, and so they spend as much time advocating for them and their needs as possible. They are the first point of access, not a doctor -- you call the MVC and speak to your midwife if you have any needs, and they decide if it's time to get a doctor or hospital involved. The mums will have multiple appointments with the midwives, usually between 8 and 10. Midwives keep a journal of the mum's visits, and they are required to fully educate the mum on her different options, how her preexisting conditions (if any) might change birth, what to look forward to, etc. and she will record all of this, and use it to create a birth plan and wants of the mum so that the medical staff at the hospital can follow this. 

The birth is exceptionally low key and relaxed unless there is complications. The mums are usually encouraged to move around while they can, entertain themselves, find comfortable positions, be spooned by a partner in a way that supports their back on their side, do whatever they need to help relax. Unless there are complications, the midwife and a nurse are who will be helping you through your birth. Once you have given birth, they apply the baby directly to your chest as soon as possible so that you can bond with them, and leave you alone to bond as a family. They come back in very briefly about an hour later and give you some check ups, and then they again, leave you alone unless you need something. This is your time to be a mum, breathe, and enjoy the baby. The average hospital costs of giving birth in Sweden, staying overnight, being fed and tested will be around 1000-1200kr, or between $100-$120 usd. Once you leave the hospital, you can leave together with no worries for work, because in Sweden, the parents get to share 480 working days off, paid (80% of your pay) so they can bond with the baby.",1585699404

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","Adrenaline being fair or not is an ongoing debate and whether or not you feel punished by it isn't really a valid arguing point because unless all 4 survivors were full health, hiding in corners out of your sight and standing perfectly still when it popped you were objectively punished. They gained time and an objective benefit from it.

I don't care about devour hope. It's a perfectly fine perk in my opinion. You can get NOED to proc by afking in the basement for the entire game. Devour Hope requires the killer to earn it's more powerful effects. If you've got a good eye and can see the killer when he's at 2 tokens you can spot it that way. It requires only 1 totem that identifies itself to be cleansed at any point and it's actually possible to know it or any other hex perk is in play before the end of the game in the first place. You don't have to bring a perk or item or gamble on wasting time because *maybe* it's in the game. If we take Haunted Ground into account and say, ""well survivors don't know if it's devour hope or haunted ground"", it's still less frustrating than NOED because you didn't have to get lucky and have been prepared before the match even started to deal with it efficiently since it can be waited out or even predicted with some deductive reasoning using information gained during the match itself. NOED would honestly feel like less bullshit if you got the exposed notification as soon as the last gen popped instead of AFTER you get hit.

&gt;Running off-meta perks doesnt mean you dont have game-sense all of a sudden. There are times you should and shouldn't do certain things, prioritize accordingly.

What does this even mean in this context? Are you implying I just don't know how to function without meta perks? Because I'll tell you right now, the only perk I consistently run that could be considered ""meta"" is BT. So I should just use my game sense to know whether the killer's running NOED before the game starts? Just use my game sense to know my team mates only cleansed 2 totems combined between the 3 of them and I shouldn't take a hit for the injured Ace on death hook?",1585699405

Come on, as if they US or Canada would have done any better.

But it doesnt bother me. Its just hair...
 What the next person does with their hair has nothing to do with me. Alot of jobs do not like freeform dreads in general because its wild and not that clean look that those jobs go for. And i am sure alot of people in the dread community can attest that they have gotten some backlash about their dreads, regardless of race. Its the same as if someone came into an interview without a shave. They more than likely wont hire that person... if a job doesnt want to hire me because of my hair then F them.

"BurningMan","t5_2qj68","That's what would happen if we held the event now. And I agree, that would be crazy. 

Five months from now might be a different story. 

Realistically, the only way to get the world back to work is to slowly reopen things, allowing a certain number of people to be infected at a rate that can be managed by our healthcare system. Then we eventually reach herd immunity, where enough people have already been infected that it stops spreading so easily.

Every model I've seen expects this to happen by September. And coronavirus doesn't mutate as quickly as flu, meaning the immunity is expected to last years.

So I agree. Look at the big picture, which suggests that after a month or two, some amount of social interaction will be not only allowed but encouraged. Covid won't go away, but our response to it will evolve over time.",1585699407

Unless OP is exclusively using Find a Room and exclusively joining 9K lobbies (there are also a handful of rooms at any given time gated in the mid 9000s that OP wouldn't be able to get into anyway), there are many other reasons Vice would be seen as bad. Most rooms are being hosted by Galex or Gleo and are probably gonna be selective about the meta. Point is, there are *tons* of rooms OP could be getting into where they are roughly as geared as everyone else and telling them that they shouldn't even touch eKY unless they have more than 9.7K might is kinda ridiculous when so few other people are following that guideline and plenty of the undergeared rooms are going to win anyway (quite frankly, 4 DPS rooms really only need to get past rings and then not make dumb mistakes, it's not like if they don't break early enough the entire game is a write-off).

Nonsense and drivel that atheists try to fly when they get into trouble - absolutely no one comes to any position without  a number of others beliefs and assumptions leading up to their conclusion. Thats how the human mind works but atheists try and con the public their minds skip those necessary steps in forming conclusions,

If you don't believe unicorns exist its because you believe 

A) that you  know enough animals to think its unlikely there are unicorns

B)  That reports of unicorns are unreliable

C)  that there are alternate credible explanations for what some ascribe as actions of unicorns

D) that science does not confirm The existence of unicorns

or E that seeing is believing and since you nevr seen one  they don't exist


Thats four/five other beliefs or assumptions that lead up to non belief in unicorns - NOT simply one of not believing

You can thank me later for the lesson in how all Human  minds work.

In the case of atheism  just about every atheist out  there believes in another non god explanation for the universe, the world and life.   Again thats how the human mind work. when we reject an idea  its because we accept a  number of other assumptions in rejecting the idea

There is no such thing as an atheist that ""only lacks belief in a god"" without  other assumptions that lead to that conclusion

its all a crock and a lie because thats not how the human minds works.  You might as well claim  you  came to the conclusion there are four apples without counting  them. We come to all conclusions by weighing and making assumptions about numerous issues.",1585699409

[This piece on NYC](https://thecity.nyc/2020/03/nyc-medical-staffers-describe-hospital-coronavirus-struggles.html) is one of the first articles I saw that named a few (fentanyl, sometimes propofol and others) that are used I think both for pain management and for putting someone under.

&gt; What are our stockpiles like

New York and other areas are definitely seeing shortages of the drugs that are used in conjunction with ventilators. That same piece discusses NYC, but fwiw I've seen anecdotally that it's definitely not an uncommon issue.

&gt; What kind of doctor has the knowledge to ventilate patients?

I think the true answer to this would be a respiratory therapist, but functionally I've been reading reporting for weeks that says when a hospital gets overwhelmed to the breaking point it basically becomes *whoever's there and able*. I remember accounts coming out of Italy where doctors were saying essentially ""there are no neurologists, there are no radiologists, there are only doctors"". And iirc even residents are supposed to know how to intubate someone, but...

&gt; How many doctors with this skill does a typical hospital have, and what happens when they inevitably get sick, like many other healthcare professionals are?

I had some time today so I looked into this a little, lol. According to the May 2019 US Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers, [there were 8,673,140 healthcare practitioners](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes290000.htm) (not including support occupations like dental assistants, that's [under a separate grouping](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes310000.htm)). Of those 8.6 million.....[132 thousand are respiratory therapists](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2019/may/oes291126.htm).

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","&gt;Prior organization dictated only certain crew would have more specialized training in damage control procedures. On the Forrestal, many of the crew better trained in firefighting were killed after bombs on deck cooked off in the conflagration they were fighting, hampering firefighting efforts. After the incidents, more widespread and better firefighting protocols were established.

Yeah, the *Forrestal* retaught the USN a lesson from WWII they had forgotten. Every man on a USN ship in (mid to late) WWII had a decent level of DC and Firefighting knowledge, and the specialized damage control units were (IIRC) actually a fair bit smaller than their Japanese counterparts. The difference was that ever crewman in the USN was taught to be a decent DC man/firefighter, while the Japanese non-DC crew had minimal training. Specialized DC crew not only put all your eggs in one basket, but severely hamper a ship's ability to respond to multiple breaches/explosions/oh-bugger-the-ship-is-on-fire moments at once. The US doctrine proved quite superior in the long run, because not only are you not relying on your DC guys to handle it, any crewmen near a fire *are* your DC guys, meaning you can respond to more issues at once, and can respond to them much more quickly. (Let's also not forget the human factor here. If you're trained for something, you're much more likely to be able to handle it. If you're told in training ""this is a fire, and we're gonna teach you how to fight it. If you EVER see a fire on your ship, you fight that fucker like your life depends on it, because it does!"", when you see a fire on your ship, you're a lot more likely to grab a hose and run towards the fire than someone who has barely been told anything about fighting fires)

The main downside of this doctrine is that it takes valuable time to teach every single sailor the basics of damage control and firefighting, and can seem like a waste. And it is, right up until the moment where it *very* isn't. But in peacetime, times when you're reminded why it's worth it are few and far between.

&gt;After the incidents, more widespread and better firefighting protocols were established.

The thing that really strikes me about the shifts in training and protocol is that all the USN did was essentially bring back the old WWII-era training and policies regarding firefighting/DC, albeit updated for newer equipment. I hope twice is enough times to learn that lesson.",1585699411

That said, this kind of news is silly. If you want to quickly flatten the curve, you want to take every logical measure possible to help reduce contracting and spreading the virus. Better be extra protected here.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

"OnceUponATime","t5_2srt7","First, I reiterate that she was simply trying to remove from his mind an idea that could only be harmful to him.  Look, take the test that I said earlier: you see the psychologist, tell him that everyone around you is a fairy tale character and observe his reaction, i assure you that he will probably think you are crazy.  Regina wasn't trying to hurt Henry; she just wanted him to forget an idea that was hurting him and  (in a world without magic in which no one would ever believe him) could only cause pain to Henry.

Second, Second, Hopper's idea of ​​following his ideas and waiting for them to pass him may have been good for befriending Henry, but let's just say it wasn't very effective. The proof is that not only does it not ""improve"" but Henry is even more obsessed with the idea that they are all fairy tale characters.  So starting from the idea that you will always live in a world without magic in which anyone will consider you crazy for these ideas, Hooper's method was neither effective nor beneficial for Henry in the future.

Third, I'm just saying that Henry didn't even know the curse existed before Mary Margaret handed him the book.  So it's IMPOSSIBLE that Henry was depressed about something he didn't even know existed.  How is it possible that he did not realize it? Well, because he was a small child and it did not occur to him to give it much importance, or it is simply a plot hole that can never be solved.  But in both cases I reiterate the impossibility of being depressed about something you don't even know exists.

Finally if it is implied throughout the series that Regina had never mistreated Henry, on the contrary Henry was everything to her and would never have hurt him.  Proof of this is in the 3x09 when she is even able to forget through a potion that Henry is the son of the savior so that she can take care of him as he should (even knowing that this endangered the entire spell).  On the other hand, if Regina had treated Henry as badly as you insinuated, it would be impossible for Henry to show him the love and affection that he has for him during the rest of the seasons.",1585699416

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","To an extend yes but there's a baseline style for each player. For example nobody can deny that Mata was one of the best support players of all time but his style of playing was about heavy resource investment in the botlane, aggressive teams, tons of skirmishing, vision denial, invades, getting advantages through all that and win unfair teamfights (that are unfair because of all the advantages that you got before).       
It didn't matter if he was on MVP, Samsung, Vici, Royal, KT or SKT he never worked as a player if the team didn't play like that, no matter how good his form or how great his teammates, and despite not being flexible he was incredible.        
       
On the other hand you have Faker a player that is a lot more flexible since he can play scaling, hyper aggressive, mid game tf, any kind of champ. Can play around top,bot or both. Can even be given no draft resources. But Faker HAS to play generating pressure even when playing low econ supportive mids like Lulu or Karma and if you don't give him jungle attention he will bluff it.      
He's probably the closest to completely flexible super star and even him has limits on his style.       
        
So you as a coach you need to understand that while a player can have ""multiple modes"" they can do (even though they don't like certain modes) every single player has style limitations and that's key when putting together a lineup.       
So for example I wouldn't put Uzi on the current IG lineup nor would I get Khan into DRX.",1585699416

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I hope Veterinarians count here, if not I'm very sorry..

My mother is a certified vet tech and surprisingly a lot of the worst cases come towards the family rescue. Our worst cases have been

1) A female lizard who was forced to breed her whole life. When the breeder asked us to take her, we got her and she had a shit ton of medical issues. Damaged to no stomach lining, mouth rot, very weak bones, pale as hell, and on top of it, fucking bone cancer. She was a very sweet lizard though. She loved humans and even cuddled with the other abused lizards to calm them. Unfortunately she passed away last week. It hurt a lot, it just seemed like even with her issues, she was smart enough to make the best of her life. 

2) We have two lizards named Joy and Panic. They both were abused. Never held or handled (if not done right or not done at all, it really fucks up your pet lizards, specifically bearded dragons. Just like a dog, they need to be given affection and love in order to learn that you aren't a threat and that you'll protect them), and they were forcibly fed by getting things shoved down their throat. It took 2 years just for Panic to trust my mother. However Joy has such bad trauma that we've wondered if putting her down and ending her paranoia and stress is the best option

3) One of our first rescues was a snake named Nagini, and her previous owners gave her a  lamp that was way too hot for her type, and they burned 3\4 of her body. They didn't even reportedly show concern, in fact a few claimed they were amused by it. She was such an amazing snake too, loved humans. She would even curl around your neck and poke your cheek if you didn't give her enough attention. Needless to say we fell in love with her, and to this day she's a family pet. 

Extra note: I see this mistake often. Do not give your pet bearded dragons or any reptile sand. It often gets stuck in their butts, and clogs them, and they die from constipation or other related issues. This is one of the reasons why they die so early in the wild.",1585699416
"MachinePorn","t5_2sdcw","@ u/Risen_Pizza

I've amended the answer, having learned that this is a _passive resonant_  damper, the description I gave atfirst being of an _active_  damper. Much of the fundamental principle is the same, though; and active damping  'smoothly morphs into' passive.

The huge mass is something for the building  to 'push against', either (as it is in this case) through _dashpots_ - passive 'shock-absorber'-like instruments, or through active powered actuators. Imagine the top of the skyscraper is beginning to sway in some direction: you might think, ""if only there were some _mountain_  or something at hand that a huge jack could push against to exert a force on the building the opposite way &amp; steady it!"". At the top of a skyscraper there is no mountain or cliff at hand ... but what we _can_  have, that's nearly as good, is a huge mass (in this case 650 long-ton or 660,000kg) and push against that. Of course, the mass is free to move ... but at _that_ kind of size, it's got so much inertia that when it's pushed it moves slowly enough that it's _almost_  as a fixed mountain or cliff.

The fact that it's free to move though means that the pattern of _pushings_  against it aren't exactly  the same as they would be if they were against an absolutely fixed point, such as a mountain or cliff.  In an _active_ mass-damping system a control system 'feels'  the swaying &amp; computes the best possible pattern of 'pushings'  against the weight. But this principle can be taken further and the servo-system dispensed with altogether: and in a passive _resonant_  damping system, which this particular one is (and a wide variety of others are around the world), the actuators become merely dashpots, and the 'sensing system' is merely the resonance of the pendulum formed by the weight and the cables on which it is slung, and the 'pushings' become the compressions of the dashpots along their length. And possibly also the 'tuggings' on the cables enter-in. The pendulum effectively swings out-of-phase with the resonance of the swaying of the building. The 'pushing' between the weight &amp; the building is now mediated by these dashpots, as it is by active _actuators_  in the _active_  damper; and the 'pattern' of the pushings does not need to be computed by any external agency - the 'computation' is intrinsic to the behaviour of the system. And it the case of this particular damper, a considerable part of the action of it is mediated by the cables it is slung on ... as is made clear in the document down the 'Jase TKU' link.

And  with a nice big weight like that the end result is _almost_  as good as it would be if _you did_  have a mountain handy!

in which the theory of operation of these passive dampers is thoroughly set-out. But beware of the error in equation 4.61 - for ""tanδ₂ = π/2"" read ""δ₂ = π/2"". And there is another one

#
There is also a kind of damper that is basically a passive resonant damper with an active one appended to _it_ :  these are mentioned in the first of the linked-to documents.

Some documents also on _active_  mass-damping.

Haha 🤣🤣🤣I downvoted 👎comment and now it says 69 that’s the sex number.👀
Q&amp;A:
What is the sex number?🍆🍆🍆
The sex number is 69🍆🍑💦. It is called the sex number because it looks like 2 people 👩‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨🍆💦🍑👉👌😳🤢🥵having sex but the wrong way.😱

What should I do?🤔🧐🤓🤔
If you are not OP 😡😤😡who got the sex number💦 of downvotes then you should reply “Nice” 😎to this comment. No different way is allowed😱! Saying nice with a lowercase n or Nice. with a full stop will force me to give the commenter an additional downvote because it is not Nice!😱😳😡😤😠
If you are OP 🤮then you must accept the downvotes and learn to never say something as silly 😤👎 as that again.

How can I fix this?😥😭😢
You cannot fix this. 😱What you said was against my and 68 😎other fellow redditors beliefs😡, so you will be forced to accept the downvote and move on😱😢😭! You may apply for special considerations by sending me 🤗 a PM (Personal Message🤓), but keep in mind that I rarely will ever do this! My opinion is very firm and is not likely to change in the future!😤😤😤👎🖕

Are there any other sex numbers?💦🍑😎🍆🤤🤢🤮
No. 69 is the only real sex number. Another number you may see is the drug number🍙😏, or 420 as the cool kids 😎😎like me👍 call it. Here you may only comment nice🙂. With a lower case n👇🏿 and a full stop. No other way is acceptable😤😤! If both 69 and 420 is present, then you must reply with a mix of the two, nice, with a lowercase n and no full stop!🤓😱👉👎🖕

Remember, don’t😠 go against the opinions of I or my fellow redditors😎, or we will be forced to apply downvotes👇🖕 to your comment, witch may result in a loss in karma!😱😨😰😳💦🍆🍑🤢🤢🤮🤤🥵😰🤓😎",1585699417

"greece","t5_2qh8i","&gt; Γράφεις πολύ κι εσύ, γράφω πολύ κι εγώ, καλό ξημέρωμα... 

Καλό ξημέρωμα (και πάλι).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;εγώ αντιλήφθηκα πως ήταν μικρό το ποσοστό αυτών που δε νοιάζονταν. από πριν να επιβληθεί η καραντίνα ο περισσότερος κόσμος έμενε στο σπίτι του. εγώ τουλάχιστον όποτε έβγαινα έβλεπα σεληνιακό τοπίο αυτό το πρόβλημα σε κάποιο βαθμό κατασκευάστηκε από τα μμε.

Κατηγορείς εμένα ότι μιλάω για καταστάσεις που δεν έχω ζήσει, ενώ μετά κάνεις κι εσύ το ίδιο. Αν έριχνες μία ματιά προς παραλία Θεσσαλονίκης όλες αυτές τις μέρες πριν την καραντίνα (μέχρι και μετά, βασικά) θα έβλεπες εκατοντάδες, μέχρι και χιλιάδες κόσμο να κυκλοφορεί ανενόχλητος σα να μη συνέβαινε τίποτα. Όλα αυτά που σου λέω φαίνονταν και με [online κάμερες](https://www.skylinewebcams.com/el/webcam/ellada/makedonia/thessaloniki/thessaloniki.html) από την άνεση του σπιτιού σου.

Το ""σεληνιακό τοπίο"" που αναφέρεις το παρατήρησα κι εγώ πράγματι σε πολλές γειτονιές, ωστόσο σε μέρη όπως πλατείες έβλεπα ακόμη κόσμο να συχνάζει σε παρέες. Το θέμα είναι πως μέχρι και αυτοί είναι αρκετοί για να διασπείρουν τον ιό. Δεν είναι κρίμα οι προσπάθειες όλων μας να αχρηστευθούν από μερικούς που είτε δεν καταλαβαίνουν είτε φέρνουν δήθεν ""αντίσταση"";

Όσον αφορά τα ΜΜΕ, εγώ είδα ρεπορτάζ που έδειχναν live τον κόσμο σε ορισμένα μέρη, και ταυτόχρονα άλλες εικόνες από το ""άδειο κέντρο της Αθήνας"", ενώ παρομοίαζαν την κατάσταση με τον Δεκαπενταύγουστο. Υπήρξαν και οι δύο πλευρές και πιστεύω είναι κάτι φυσιολογικό. Δεν πρόκειται κανείς να κάνει ρεπορτάζ για ένα μέρος που έχει μέτρια κινητικότητα. Ή θα πας στα άδεια για να δείξεις ότι ο κόσμος ακολουθεί τα μέτρα, ή στα γεμάτα για να δείξεις τους βλαμμένους που δεν υπακούουν.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;επίσης βλέπω πως ήδη θυσιάζονται άνθρωποι. Οι άνθρωποι σε φυλακές και κέντρα κράτησης, σε κάποια απ' τα οποία αστυνομικοί έχουν ήδη πιθανώς μεταφέρει τον ιό. Τα άτομα με σοβαρά συμπτώματα που παίρνουν τηλέφωνο τον εοδυ, ο οποίος νομίζω προσανατολίζεται στη μείωση του κόστους πιο πολύ απ' όσο στην υγεία και τους λέει να μείνουν στο σπίτι τους. Ο κόσμος που ενδεχομένως να πεθάνει από ενδοοικογενειακή βία. Ο κόσμος που δε θα έχει φαγητό να φάει και σπίτι να μείνει θα ζήσει όλος;

Για τις φυλακές νομίζω σου απάντησα ήδη σε προηγούμενο σχόλιο ότι η εξασφάλιση εξαιρετικών συνθηκών διαβίωσης είναι λογικό να μην είναι προτεραιότητα της κυβέρνησης. Σχετικά με τον ΕΟΔΥ όμως αυτό που γράφεις δεν βγάζει νόημα. Ένα τεστ για τον κορονοϊό δεν κοστίζει μερικές εκατοντάδες ή χιλιάδες, αλλά της τάξεως των δεκάδων ευρώ ([1](https://www.axios.com/medicare-price-cdc-coronavirus-test-b11170ec-9d40-494f-a3b0-db5005cb7377.html), [2](https://www.news247.gr/koinonia/test-gia-koronoio-pote-to-kano-poy-ginetai-poso-kostizei.7600430.html), [3](https://www.fortunegreece.com/article/test-gia-koronoio-pote-to-kano-pou-ginete-poso-kostizi/)). Το πρόβλημα λοιπόν δεν βρίσκεται στο κόστος για τον ΕΟΔΥ αλλά στα αποθέματα αντιδραστηρίων. Η οικονομία εξ' άλλου περνάει τόσο σοβαρές προκλήσεις αυτή τη στιγμή που το να εξετάσουν 10000 άτομα τη μέρα αντί 5000 δεν θα ήταν τρομερό έξοδο σε σχέση με όλα τα άλλα που υπάρχουν. Άλλωστε αν υπήρχαν αρκετά αντιδραστήρια, γιατί να μην επιτρέπουν σε αυτούς που θέλουν να εξεταστούν, αλλά δεν ανήκουν στις ομάδες που εξετάζονται, να δώσουν ένα 50ρικο και να κάνουν το τεστ; Πολύ απλά κάθε χώρα στον κόσμο αυτή τη στιγμή προσπαθεί να προμηθευτεί τεστ, και έτσι δεν επαρκούν, γι'αυτόν το λόγο τεστάρονται μόνο αυτοί που πραγματικά το χρειάζονται και οι υπόλοιποι παίρνουν απλά την οδηγία να κάτσουν σπίτι, (**αλλά να τηλεφωνήσουν ξανά εφόσον εμφανίσουν ορισμένα πιο σοβαρά συμπτώματα)** αφού είναι αρκετά πιθανό να περάσουν ελαφριά τη νόσο.

Για την ενδοοικογενειακή βία σου απάντησα στο προηγούμενο σχόλιο. Κι ας πεις ότι δεν επαρκούν οι δομές της ΕΛΑΣ, προτιμάς να πεθάνουν χιλιάδες άνθρωποι από τον ιό χωρίς να υπάρξει καμία προσπάθεια περιορισμού της μετάδοσής του; Πραγματικά δεν καταλαβαίνω τη λογική σου. Αισθάνομαι ότι προσπαθείς να εξυπηρετήσεις τα υποκείμενα ιδεολογήματά σου επικαλούμεν@ κάθε πιθανή παράπλευρη απώλεια για να χτυπήσεις στο συναίσθημα. Τα λινκ δεν καταλαβαίνω γιατί μου τα στέλνεις πραγματικά. Νομίζεις ότι δεν θα πατήσω να δω τι είναι και θα σε παραδεχτώ κατευθείαν; Στο πρώτο λινκ το μόνο που αναφέρουν είναι ότι η ΕΛΑΣ δεν επεμβαίνει μονάχα αν υπάρχουν στέρεες αποδείξεις ότι υπάρχει οικογενειακή βία. Αν πήγαιναν να κάνουν τυφλές συλλήψεις από δω και από κει δεν θα ήταν λίγο γιούργια τα πράγματα; Θα έπαιρνε τηλέφωνο ο μικρός Νικολάκης ότι η μαμά του και καλά τον χτυπάει επειδή δεν του δίνει το πλειστέισιον πίσω και θα συλλάμβαναν την μάνα... Γι' αυτό, όπως ανέφερε ο άνθρωπος στο ποστ υπάρχουν και οργανώσεις όπως το Χαμόγελο του Παιδιού. Όσον αφορά το δεύτερο περιστατικό, έχεις δίκιο αν το θεωρείς απαράδεκτο και πράγματι δεν έπρεπε να συμβεί. Δεν υπάρχει όμως περίπτωση να με πείσεις ότι η καραντίνα είναι λάθος επειδή έτυχε ένας άνθρωπος να μην γίνει αντικείμενο σωστής αντιμετώπισης από τις αρχές.

Ο κόσμος που δεν θα έχει να φάει σπίτι θα είχε αν δεν υπήρχε ο κορονοϊός;

&gt;στα ψυχολογικά, δεν περνάμε όλοι και όλες το ίδιο πράγμα. Άλλο είναι να δοκιμάζεσαι και να υποφέρεις όντας υγιής και άλλο όταν έχεις χίλια δυο υποκείμενα νοσήματα. Και οι παραινέσεις σου για δημιουργική απασχόληση είναι λίγο οφ γιατί μιλάς από θέση άγνοιας, νομίζω. Αν δεις και την πλατφόρμα, η εταιρεία προειδοποιεί για να είναι καλυμμένη: αν έχεις σοβαρό, άμεσο πρόβλημα, μην μπεις σε μας. Μίλα με τον/τη γιατρό σου ή με ψυχιατρική κλινική (εδώ μπαίνει άλλο ένα στάδιο γραφειοκρατίας πριν να επισκεφθείς την κλινική).

Φυσικά δεν περνάμε όλοι το ίδιο. Απλά σου ανέφερα ότι δεν υπάρχει άγνοια εκ μέρους της πολιτείας και γίνεται αυτό που είναι δυνατό. Στη χειρότερη αν επικοινωνήσεις με τον ψυχολόγο σου μέσω υπολογιστή, ή αν δεν έχεις, μέσω τηλεφώνου (ναι, κατανοώ πως δεν είναι το ίδιο απλά μιλάω για ένα last resort) δεν θα μπορέσει να σε βοηθήσει σε μία έκτακτη κατάσταση; Προφανώς ένας άνθρωπος που επισκέπτεται τακτικά ψυχολόγο και τον έχει πολύ ανάγκη έχει συνεννοηθεί ώστε να μπορεί να επικοινωνήσει αυτόν τον καιρό. Όλοι κάνουμε θυσίες και ίσως η πρόσωπο-με-πρόσωπο επικοινωνία να πρέπει να είναι μία από αυτές. Για το κοινό καλό είναι...

 

&gt;οι άστεγοι/ες κινδυνεύουν να συλληφθούν να τριγυρίζουν άσκοπα, αν δεν έχει φτιάξει δομή γι' αυτούς και γι' αυτές ο κάθε δήμος. Δομές οι δήμοι φτιάχνουν, αν φτιάχνουν, για κόσμο με χαρτιά. Βέβαια ο κόσμος χωρίς χαρτιά έχει εξ ορισμού χειρότερα προβλήματα.

Όχι, δεν κινδυνεύουν να συλληφθούν. Οι αστυνομικοί δεν είναι ρομπότ, και μπορώ να σου εγγυηθώ ότι δεν πρόκειται να κόψουν πρόστιμο σε κανέναν άστεγο επειδή κυκλοφορεί έξω. Αν πάνε να του κόψουν πρόστιμο και πει ότι δεν έχει μόνιμη κατοικία να παραμείνει πιστεύεις ότι θα επιμείνουν; [Άλλωστε έχει δοθεί εντολή στους δήμους σχετικά με τη διαχείριση αστέγων αυτόν τον καιρό.](https://www.ieidiseis.gr/ellada/item/38926-apagorefsi-kykloforias-idiaiteri-merimna-se-astegous-toksikoeksartimenous-roma-kai-adespota)

&gt; χωρίς χαρτιά αυτό τον καιρό μπορούν να είναι άτομα που μπήκαν στην Ελλάδα όσο διαρκεί το απαράδεκτο πάγωμα υποβολής αιτήσεων ασύλου. Υπάρχει και μια δεύτερη κατηγορία που ξέρω: άτομα που ήρθαν εδώ από πολέμους και διώξεις, με ήδη καταρρακωμένο ηθικό, ζήτησαν άσυλο, και τα έκλεισαν όσο ήταν το αίτημά τους υπό εξέταση σε κέντρα υποδοχής τύπου Μόρια. Ευτυχώς δεν εχουμε ούτε εσύ ούτε εγώ προσωπική εμπειρία από τέτοια μέρη, εγώ τα έχω δει μόνο σε επισκέψεις, αλλά έχω δει και κοντινό μου κόσμο να μιλάει για ξύλο και βασανιστήρια και να τρέμει και να μη θέλει να βγει έξω μήνες μετά μήπως και συναντήσει αστυνομικό στον δρόμο και δε βλέπω το θέμα φιλολογικά. Λοιπόν, πολύς κόσμος απλά δεν άντεξε και τό 'σκασε από τα νησιά (οι διαδικασίες ασύλου καθυστερούσαν αδικαιολόγητα λόγω ανοργανωσιάς —τώρα επισπεύστηκαν λόγω σχεδόν αυτόματης απόρριψης), μόνο που μετά για να συνεχίσει τη διαδικασία του έπρεπε να γυρίσει στα κέντρα στα νησιά, και ήταν τέτοιο το ptsd που πολύ απλά δεν μπορούσε. (Και στα χερσαία σύνορα πέφτει ξύλο, βασανιστήρια, επαναπροωθήσεις.) Δεν είναι καθόλου ίδια η κατάσταση με σένα που κάνεις ένα ταξιδάκι στην Ιαπωνία. Και τελειώνω γρηγορα. 

Σεβαστό το ότι έχεις παρατηρήσει άθλιες συνθήκες διαβίωσης για αυτούς τους ανθρώπους. Για το ότι θεωρείς απαράδεκτο το πάγωμα των αιτήσεων ασύλου δεν θα επεκταθώ εδώ γιατί δεν είναι το θέμα μας, ωστόσο διαφωνώ. Το θέμα είναι ότι αυτοί οι άνθρωποι που είχαν κάνει αίτημα δεν είναι πολλοί σε σχέση με τους 11 εκατομμύρια που κατοικούν σε αυτόν τον τόπο. Και δυστυχώς ή ευτυχώς, αν έχουμε να επιλέξουμε μεταξύ του βέβαιου θανάτου εκατοντάδων χιλιάδων συμπολιτών μας (ηλικιωμένων, ανθρώπων με χρόνια νοσήματα κλπ) και την απλά ίσως κακή μεταχείριση μερικών ανθρώπων που στην πλειοψηφία τους είναι νέοι άντρες και κινδυνεύουν πολύ λιγότερο από τον ιό.

Also, I just looked through and saw that Out of the Box is on there. That was one of my favorite shows to watch on Playhouse Disney as a kid, along with Roly Poly Olie and Bear in the Big Blue House (neither of which is on Disney+... yet). It's pretty good at teaching a lot of things to kids. And it shouldn't be too annoying for parents to be able to watch either.

""Allergy shots, known as immunotherapy, can reduce symptoms, although they can’t eliminate them. They gradually desensitize the allergic person’s immune system to the pet allergens by injecting known allergy-causing agents under the skin. This triggers the body to produce antibodies (protective proteins). These antibodies block the dog allergen from causing a reaction. Depending on the severity of the allergy, people will receive one dose a week for anywhere from a few weeks to several months. A follow-up dose once a month usually controls the allergic reaction.""",1585699418

"HistoryMemes","t5_2v2cd","Hello There

It is well known that there is lots of low effort and repetitive content. Some users complain about too many WWII memes while others complain about too many rome memes or say we are too Euro-crentric or American-centric. We think these users are completely barking up the wrong tree when it comes to stopping low effort content on this sub. Truth is that r/HistoryMemes is far too Earth-centric in its meme subjects so in an effort to save this subreddit from itself we are banning all memes about history on Earth.

You might be thinking what you can meme about, well luckily for us we found 3 excellent historical sources by someone named George Lucas. These documentaries called the “Star Wars Prequels” chronicle the fall of a republic. It’s not a story the historians would tell you, it’s a meme legend! Apparently another subreddit called “[r/prequelhumour](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/)” or something found them before us so we are taking a bit of inspiration off them.  


We updated our rules to reflect this new direction, so have fun memeing about the events that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…",1585699419

You dont have to gamble over sports. Casinos are full of games in which people throw their money away.

Yes, but not in an evil way in which you describe it.

""OH you lost... now you will suffer the consequences of your failure \*evil laughter\*""

Sure, high level sports are cutthroat, but that is not because of sports but because of the money and fame involved.

Football is just men running on the field and trying to score a goal. Thats it. There is no money involved.

"MUAontheCheap","t5_3m2bs","I love overtone!!! So I have black hair and usually get a standard honey brown balayage situation, but use overtime to switch it up with the purple for brown or rose gold for brown masks. 

Some tips: 
Apply to dry hair but not super dirty hair (I like to do it the day after a hair wash and also when I haven’t used a bunch of styling products)

Leave it on for half an hour! I like to put it in and then soak in the tub while it marinates.

Do it naked and with gloves. If you’re doing it close to your ears/roots def use Vaseline on the face to avoid getting the dye on your skin.

It will stain your tub! Immediately after I rinse out I put some Comet in and rinse that out after at least an hour. 

Always get the mask! The maintenance conditioner is not a good value tbh. It would still stain your hands if you used it in the shower, and it isn’t as pungent as the dye/mask. For touch ups just use some of the mask in the shower instead. 

Red and blue/green are a bitch to strip from your hair. And look kinda bad if you go from one to the other. Big risk of it turning muddy/brown. Use your color wheel knowledge when diy dyeing!",1585699419

2. it will collapse the medical system. Medical staff will face casualties and probably go on strike or quit.

"thedivision","t5_2xiqd","The issue isn't that non dps are needed for endgame, thats a good thing, but needing them and having them be unique is a different story.

All the builds are the same, mainly because there are only 2 talents to work with. If we still had passives, that would be 4 extra talents to work with, you could heal more, or have more skill haste, or have a longer lasting heal, or a bigger radius, on and on, and for other builds too.

Instead, it's all the same, most efficient build, and if you have anything different, you're simply worse than someone who has the ""right"" stuff.

Just look at dps. When you play with a good tank and healer, you want the most dps, which means running glass cannon. But why? It's not because it gives the biggest buff, its because the others don't even come close. 

Imagine if glass cannon was ""balanced"" the same way the other talents are. Lets say, you gain 30 weapon damage (not multiplicative), but take an increased 30% damage. This means things generally wont 1 shot you, unless its like a sniper.

Now, you have a choice, get an instant, always active 30 weapon damage, or use something like obliterate for 15% without a downside, but it has a delay. Which would you use? What about spotter, instant 15% multiplicative, but requires pulse. And look at glass cannon now. Instant 30%, always active, why would anyone use anything else.

The only downside to glass cannon is that you die to bullshit, mostly status effects or long range shotguns/smg. These deaths are not fair, or deserved. I could be taking 10000% incoming damage, it doesn't make these deaths fun or interactive, there is no counterplay to being instakilled. This is why people are dying, but when you're at the point of min-maxing, glass cannon is so much stronger than anything else, its a requirement.",1585699421

You can ride on a short charge no problem.  Top it off for the next day so you can really feel the performance.  It will always perform better on a full battery and lose some performance as you lose charge.

It gets pretty hot in Southern California I don’t think I’ve had any heat problems this past summer.  I put 2000 miles on mine in 5 months(and another 2000 on an Ultra) 

Here’s a video I made about batteries.  The main thing you need to know is to not run it on maximum speed when the battery is on the bottom end.    You risk an intentional shut off. The BMS Will turn you off before you risk overheating. I talk about it in this video. It’s very important to understand this if you are going to ride a lot of miles and go to the bottom of the battery.

One last thing, always ride it with both motors.  Not only do you risk overheating but it could potentially bend the frame and is definitely inefficient on the battery.

"books","t5_2qh4i","&gt;The Authors Guild, a leading authors' organization, wrote Friday that it was ""appalled"" by the Internet Archive's move. ""We are shocked that the Internet Archive would use the COVID-19 epidemic as an excuse to push copyright law further out to the edges, and in doing so, harm authors, many of whom are already struggling,"" the group wrote.

Sorry, author's guild, but this quote right here lost me.  ""Push copyright law further to the edges""?  Give me a break.  Copyright law grants product control to a degree and scope that is not only well beyond the constitutional intent of copyright, but outright counter to it.  If copyright law is at any kind of an edge, it is in giving too much power to license holders, and any move away from that is pushing it in the right direction.  

As a struggling writer myself, I sympathize with other writers who are struggling.  I sympathize with them against a publishing industry that has profited on the backs of their work while giving very little back.  I don't sympathize with anyone who is saying that copyright needs to be more strictly enforced.  That's ignorance.",1585699423

When London, England, for example, is now 45% white English people, the fabric of that city has changed forever. Can it even be called an English city anymore? The same with Birmingham and other British cities. 

The opposition you spoke of is not unjust. No other countries would accept this. Japan would never let their capital city become 45% Japanese and no one would expect them to.

"perl","t5_2qh5e","Here's what I've found so far for anyone who may come upon this thread.  The problem turned out to be the Tkx GUI.  While I was in the ActiveState environment and they stopped support for the Perl/Tk module, I migrated to Tkx.  I found out that this is something that was optimized for their environment and when I went to Strawberry Perl, there was a problem.  To fix the problem, I had to add the following line to my script.  After that, no more command window popups.

 **Win32::SetChildShowWindow(0) if defined &amp;Win32::SetChildShowWindow;** 

I found the solution in this blog: [https://gojooz.blogspot.com/2009/08/](https://gojooz.blogspot.com/2009/08/)

However, I have found another problem that PerlApp took care of.  I need to find a way to include the TCL part of Tkx.  If ActiveTcl is not installed on the target machine, the exe doesn't work.  When I ran it under Powershell, I got the following. So I'm still searching for a solution for an exe.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;Source? And not subcontractors mind you, employees. Then we can discuss why employers cannot verify the identity of employees too.

Literally every business does, the fact that you ask for a source on ""businesses as a whole employ illegals"" is pretty damn stupid.

&gt;You absolutely do. There are millions of people in the USA who came here illegally, or were the children of illegals who can now vote. If we had secure borders since the 1970s, democrats would have millions fewer voters today and you would have no prayer of winning a president election. You would have trouble winning CA without all those people. You have millions and millions of extra voters because you cheated.
Illegals are the lifeblood of democrats. That is why you all oppose the wall so vociferously.

And if Republicans hadn't gerrymandered the everyloving fuck out of the voting districts our votes would actually count for what they're worth. Do you ever think that maybe the reason why immigrants and the children of immigrants vote for democrats if because they have a sense of human decency in their policies instead of ""fuck you I've got mine"" and 'subtle' racism. 

&gt;You have millions and millions of extra voters because you cheated.

This in particular is ironic as all fucking hell, the Republicans straight up rig voting districts and try at every turn to push legal limits of what they can do to win elections outside of actually getting more votes, democrats have humanist policies that appeal to the impoverished, yOu GuYs ChEaTeD",1585699428

Χρειάζομαι κάποια πηγή για αυτό που λες. Τι πάει να πει ""δες πού δίνει λεφτά""; Αν αναφέρεσαι στην επίταξη ιδιωτικών κλινικών, λογικό δεν είναι να αξιοποιήσει τον ιδιωτικό τομέα σε κρίσεις όπου δεν επαρκεί ο δημόσιος; Και εδώ αισθάνομαι ότι για να εξυπηρετήσεις τις προϋπάρχουσες θέσεις σου καταλήγεις στο αφήγημα: ""ιδιωτικός τομέας bad"", αγνοώντας το γεγονός ότι είναι αναγκαίο. Και ναι, η χρησιμοποίηση προϋπαρχουσών δομών είναι φθηνότερη και γρηγορότερη από τη δημιουργία νέων.

&gt;το λινκ που σου έστειλα ξεκινάει με αυτά τα λόγια για να συνεχίσει και να ορίσει πότε είναι warranted η καραντίνα και από τι άλλα μέτρα θα πρέπει να συνοδεύεται. Είναι λίγο δικό σου θέμα στην κατανόηση του κειμένου αυτό. 

Ωραία, επειδή λοιπόν δεν έχουμε όλοι το χρόνο ή τη διάθεση να αναλύσουμε ένα 44σέλιδο κείμενο γεμάτο νομικούς όρους που μας πετάνε ξερό στη μούρη, μήπως μπορείς να μου παραθέσεις συγκεκριμένα κομμάτια/σελίδες να διαβάσω και να σου απαντήσω; 

&gt; Αυτά γενικά, προσπάθησε να μην κρίνεις εξ ιδίων πράγματα με τα οποία ενδεχομένως να μην έχεις έρθει σε επαφή. Μπορεί για σένα ένα θέμα να είναι ένα μάτσο λέξεις και ιδέες, αλλά υπάρχει κόσμος που ίσως αυτό το θέμα το ζει και για τον οποίο αυτά που λες κουβαλάνε μαζί τους τρομερή βία. Μεγάλο μέρος του ποστ σου καταλήγει έτσι να υποστηρίζει διάφορες καταπιέσεις και κακοποιήσεις με λίγο έξτρα victim blaming. Μην το κάνεις αυτό, να σκέφτεσαι παντού τον άνθρωπο, και καληνύχτα.

Αυτά που λες είναι γελοιότητες. Μου λες να μην κρίνω εξ ιδίων πράγματα. Αναφέρεσαι σε όλες αυτές τις περιπτώσεις όπου άνθρωποι υποφέρουν και καλά λόγω της καραντίνας, αλλά αγνοείς πλήρως το ότι σε μερικές μέρες χάθηκαν χιλιάδες άνθρωποι από διπλανές μας χώρες μονάχα επειδή αυτές άργησαν να πάρουν μέτρα (και μάντεψε, κι αυτές ΚΑΡΑΝΤΙΝΑ επέβαλαν, φαντάσου να μην το είχαν κάνει καν!) Προτιμάς λοιπόν να καταδικάσουμε μερικές δεκάδες χιλιάδες ανθρώπους στο θάνατό τους; Ή μήπως να πάρουμε δραστικά μέτρα και να προσπαθήσουμε να κάνουμε το καλύτερο για δευτερεύουσες απώλειες;

Με βάση το παραπάνω, η φράση σου ""να σκέφτομαι παντού τον άνθρωπο"" καταλήγει να είναι ό,τι πιο γελοίο και αντιφατικό έχω διαβάσει απόψε :) Καληνύχτα και σε εσένα.",1585699428

1. Mobile users will have an easier time selecting &amp; copypasting your friend code.
2. When nearing ultra or best friends, redditors can easily find &amp; contact you

It doesn't matter why hunters are hunting, what matters is that they're doing it. Why spend tax dollars on sterilizing animals in the wild when you could get people to go and give them a *quicker* death than they would get with any other predator for free?

Among everything he's done, my personal favourite is the Maserati Quattroporte Mark IV. At first glance, it's just a formal and boxy executive sedan designed in the late 80s. But then you look more and its somehow lithe and exotic too. While still being a boxy late 80s sedan. Combine that with impressive performance (even by today's standards),  sumptuous luxury and wild maintenance bills and you have my ideal lottery car.

While that makes you a good person, as youre trying to help others, you do need to understand that you also have your limits. You are also important. Listening to others and helping them out is a great thing to do, but you need to learn how to draw the line and say ""hey, i cant help you any further."" And while that can help a little bit, it doesnt help with the latter half, your anxiety. Anxiety can wreck you if you allow it to overtake your life. Your anxiety seems to stem from your friends actions, which shows a slightly unstable friendship. The best thing to do in a situation like that is ti talk about it. Talk to your friends about how you get anxious when they act strangely. The best thing to do in any and all friendships/relationships is to be transparent with your emotions and feelings. Leaving eachother in the dark doesnt help anyone, so let them know how you feel, and then the two of you can hopefully move on and support eachother in a healthy way.",1585699432

"Degrassi","t5_2rtsx","Emma and Sean, JT and Liberty and Paige and Alex are the most overrated couples in the show's history. Emma and Sean had a nice junior high romance but they became different people in high school, and should never have gotten back together. JT and Liberty getting together never made any sense to me, and felt like the show throwing a bone to the fans who wanted to see it happen. And Paige and Alex was such a one-sided relationship. I think Alex actually did love Paige, but I don't think Paige felt the same way. Paige always treated Alex like baggage.

Riley was the best male character on the show in season 8. Yeah, Argiris Karras isn't the greatest actor, but Riley's storyline was easily the strongest male character arc on the show. They really didn't do much with any of the other male characters that season.

People have incredibly unrealistic ideas about Zoe's punishment for Degrassi Nudes. You have to remember, these are TEENAGERS. Zoe was a high school sophomore at the time, which meant, at the oldest, she was 16. No law enforcement agency is going to arrest a 16-year-old and charge them with a felony for a situation like this. She would probably have been expelled, since it happened on school property (which is my only gripe with this plot, that she wasn't) but community service is probably a realistic punishment for what she did. Plus, her record would have been expunged by the time she turned 18.

I will forever argue that the most unrealistic plot the show ever did was when Jimmy and Spinner opened Squatch Designs. I've said this elsewhere on this sub, but no landlord would rent their space to two teenagers with ZERO business background, especially ones who are still in high school/college freshmen. Not only that, but the way the show portrayed this plot made it seem like the business opened within a matter of days/weeks. You will not change my mind on this.",1585699433
"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The label, if you put it on petrol pumps, would be aimed at people like this:

&gt;Over two-fifths (42%) of people in Great Britain in 2014 agreed with the  statement: ‘Many of the journeys of less than 2 miles that I now make  by car I could just as easily walk’.

[https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/fivefactsaboutcars/2016-09-22](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/fivefactsaboutcars/2016-09-22) 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I made the distinction between lifestyles that do and don't need cars. A lable like this won't shame someone into moving closer to work and it won't make buses magically appear but it might shame them into walking the journeys they should be walking. I can't find the stat now but an obscenely high proportion of  car journeys are under 1 mile.

"loveafterlockup","t5_9e0cp","That's not a generalization. It's a statement based on first-hand knowledge of the black hair industry and customers buying habits. 

Perhaps you don't know many women in YOUR circle that prefer to wear a lace-front over a sew in. But the Naturalista (natural hair) movement not only gave birth to a barrage of haircare products within the $2.5 billion black hair care industry; but also reinvigorated wig sales for a myriad of reasons (one being, wearing a lace-front as a ""protective style"" is significantly less damaging to the hair than a sew-in weave). 

Online retailers like Amazon, AliExpress, Ebay and even Wal-Mart sell LF's (from 3rd party Chinese sellers), making lace fronts even more accessible, further adding to their popularity among former weave wearers.  

As a Naturalista; doing hair and making LF's paid for my business degree and although I own a successful marketing firm with clients from various industries, the black hair industry will always be my first passion. I own and operate two websites that sell hair and am in the process of leasing a brick and mortar location for my beauty supply store (soon to be the only black owned beauty supply store in my state-process sadly delayed due to COVID19). No generalizations here, I can inform and educate on buying trends within the black hair industry all day.

No shade... You aren't aware of the popularity of the LF wig as I assume you only notice a wig when someone in your orbit is wearing one that is installed badly. But there are far more women choosing to wear a LF over a weave than you realize. 

Best!

I've actually just been trying a few ideas to see if you could shortcut it in someway, but haven't found much. If you have / can find a way to automate bringing up the terminal and type  `php artisan make:view` you would then only need to type 'login' for the file in the default spot, or auth.login for it in an auth folder, but my current feeling is it's not super useful for you.

More generally - you may already have it, but the vscode extension [Laravel Artisan](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryannaddy.laravel-artisan) seems like it might be handy; gives you most default artisan commands with more yes/no style questions rather than typing in all the command flags.

Are you limited to virtual buttons only or would you be able to use something like a [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck)? That would give you a range of awesome custom options for everything and can use [this plugin](https://github.com/nicollasricas/vscode-streamdeck) to directly call vscode menu or terminal commands or insert snippets etc which could save significant typing. Otherwise a virtual shortcut system might be able to do something similar triggered by the mouse with a different plugin...",1585699435

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","I’m in Phoenix AZ.  Picked up groceries from Fry’s yesterday, they couldn’t fulfill any of my water, toilet paper or cleaning supplies (also chicken seems to be in short supply now too for some reason).  

I scheduled a supplemental one for Walmart for today, they also could not fulfill the same things (including chicken, which was weird).

I’m desperate so on my way home I stopped at Food City and Walgreens, neither had any paper products or disinfectant (although I did finally find chicken and water at Food City).  

There is no “real” lockdown order from our governor and stores are fucking packed.  

When I went to Walmart pickup today, I had to drive by the front of the store and there were so many people there, and a disturbing number of children, almost no one wearing a mask.  

There might be a store here that has stuff, but I don’t exactly feel safe going into 5 different places in the same day to strike out.  Maybe I will get lucky on a pickup order when things calm the fuck down.

""Locations in the Nether correlate to Overworld coordinates, but horizontal Overworld distances are scaled down by a ratio of 8:1 for travel in the Nether. Therefore, traveling one block in the Nether means traveling eight blocks in the Overworld. For example, in a perfect scenario, a player who enters a portal in the Overworld at x=0, z=0 and travels in the Nether to x=1000, z=1000 returns to the Overworld at x=8000, z=8000. This makes portals a useful tool for traveling long distances in the Overworld.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A few reasons:

1) It's a new disease. When related viral genomes recombine, you end up with these hybrids capable of infecting a whole new host range. We have no resistance against these hybrid viruses and so they can hit much harder than say cold.

2) It results in flu-like symptoms and in certain cases pneumonia. The populations most at-risk for developing pneumonia are the immunocompromised and the elderly. 

3) SARS wasn't (relatively) lethal. But a lot of people got very sick and China blew off their response to it. The international medical community burned them for it and to keep that from happening again, they shut down Wuhan. It was effective (for now), so the rest of the world tried a less draconian version.  Also, the related MERS virus has a mortality rate of ~33% IIRC. So a big question was where in that 2-35% mortality range COVID19 would land.

4) It's easily spread, by droplets and possibly aerosols. Current estimates (which quite frankly I thought were poorly controlled) suggest the virus remains viable 4-8 hours after deposition, perhaps longer. Estimates for R0 transmissions are around the same rate as the flu. Think about how hard that went through this year.

5) We can always say we overestimated the needed response and people will grumble. If we blew off the response, the disease turned out as bad as is currently expected, our medical infrastructure would be overwhelmed. People are dumb, panicky creatures who are raging hypochondriacs. ERs overflow with people who got dust in their throats and coughed. People with true emergencies don't get access to aid needed to save their lives. The people with serious COVID19 are at increased risk of death. 

Personally speaking, I wish we could get people to show similar concern (wiping down surfaces, hand washing, not going out if unnecessary) annually limit influenza in the same at-risk populations, but oh well. I also lay a HUGE part of this problem with the media, who have treated this as the end of the world ever since Wuhan was locked down.",1585699440

"microdosing","t5_2yt3g","Psychedelics are great for clearing trauma, but anxiety isn't that simple.

You need to change your lifestyle with the best start to be with your diet. Countless disorders have now been shown to be linked to inflammation, from depression and anxiety to ADHD and Autism. 

You need to remove all chronic triggers of inflammation, such as gluten; sugar, and anything else that may be deemed inflammatory (Google is your friend here). The easiest way to do it is to go Paleo. Paleo is closer to what humans are actually supposed to eat and cuts out all the bullshit that cripples our mental health.

Dietary change actually had the biggest impact on my well-being, alongside exercise (which I **expect** you are doing at least 3-4 times a week).

Look after your Testosterone levels. Testosterone regulates GABA, which is why high testosterone and confidence go hand-in-hand. It'll keep you goal oriented and focused - *(like how men are supposed** to be. Do your own research into how to raise it. I recommend googling the free ebook by Christopher Walker, Master your T. 

Find a masculine role model. There's plenty out there such as Elliott Hulse; Joe Rogan; Jordan Peterson even. Men are stoic. You need to dump any left-wing ideology you may have and start living like how men are supposed to live, else you will never become the strongest version of yourself. 

Get some sunlight. Spend at least 4 hours a week in nature. Believe it or not, the bacteria in the air and earth is pretty damn good for you. In fact, bacteria regulate your personality more than anything else in your body, which is another reason why you should eat paleo.

Be social. Not easy at this moment in time, but do what you can. I'm antisocial by nature so I completely understand this one is a pain in the arse. Start saying yes to more opportunities and stuff. Socialising =/= drinking. Grab some buddies and go and climb a mountain or something, or learn how to fish. If you have no buddies then join some club for a hobby you like and meet people. Easier said than done but it'll be a lot easier once your diet is fixed up

Avoid hedonism. Find your purpose in life. This is one thing I praise psychedelics for, because (at least for me) they lift a veil and grant an awareness that let's you see things more clearly. It's easier to see what you want to do when you start thinking about what's possible rather than what's not possible. Macrodosing shrooms is a godsend for this.

Don't worry if some days are worse than others. Two steps forward; one step backwards is still a step forward. Keep at it and compare yourself to who you were last year, not yesterday. 

Learn to be self-dependent. You cannot trust the government to support you (as we're witnessing at this very moment). Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day; teach a man to fish and he can do whatever the fuck he wants with it.


Never give up. Just remember that reality comes from the mind. That's why some people see a world of opportunity and love while others see grey and misfortune. Bad shit happens to everyone; take it as a lesson and move forward.",1585699441

"NEU","t5_2r47x","I was in a super similar situation! Came in with ~70 hrs of college credits and fulfilled NUPath. I am a CECS major which is generally a 5 year 3 co-op program with 3 summer terms, and I will be able to complete it with 3.5 years, 2 co-ops, and one summer term so I think the timeline for neu could potentially be shortened for you. 

Don’t stress out too much about the equivalency database since all of your credits will be probably be accepted and you might be the first from your school to come in with courses (so they may not be listed yet). The credits will let you register early for classes and be a “junior” when you begin. Your credits will also count towards graduation, and you should check the class plan for the CS major and assume all the basic classes (physics, calc, chem, etc) will transfer. This will help you arrange a general timeline for your graduation requirements and how long it will actually take you to graduate with co-ops. 

I don’t think you would have to stay four years if you don’t want to. With the summers I saved I did full time research after freshman year and am extending my co-op through the summer this time, so it’s definitely possible for you to arrange the schedule how you want and go home and work there. There’s also lots of co-op opportunities in Cali that you could apply for. I think the co-op program is so worth the experience, and you’ll probably be a competitive applicant since you can jump in to the more advanced courses sooner and maybe get work experience over the summer. The co-op program will also help you make money during school and get you a higher paying job after graduation which might make up for the timeline. Most cs co-op positions can put you in a good position to save 10-20k each time which can be put towards the extra tuition cost. The cost difference was about the same between my state school and neu and I am so happy I made the decision to come to Boston! Hope this helps and lmk if you have any questions!",1585699441

It's like saying all the people in the ghetto, projects or a bad neighborhood are bad and the people who don't talk to the cops are *protecting* the criminals, when that's obviously not true. They don't talk because they're *scared*.

Yes, there are a lot of shitty cops out there. There are ones who turn a blind eye and look the other way, but a lot of them just want to do their jobs without worrying if they'll get backup because they told on a fellow officer. They do get away with more than the normal person, but it is a lot like the owner of a corner store not saying who robbed them because they're scared of whatever retribution may come their way.

Also, cops don't make the laws and a lot of them will give you a ticket or charge you with the lesser crime, especially if you show a little respect. If you get pulled over and start ranting and yelling ""fuck the police"" what do you think is gonna happen?",1585699442

There is a link on the website of the Pandemic Defense Force at [http://PandemicDefenseForce.net](http://PandemicDefenseForce.net) that shows how just about anyone can make their own masks with materials most people have in their homes already. You don't even need to know how to sew. The link to the video is in the top left corner of every page. The Pandemic Defense Force has also offered to provide thousands of face masks per day to two hospitals and they told us they didn't need them.

We might be able to do this for other hospitals around the world, but only if someone at the hospitals actually wants us to. We also have a design for improvised ventilators that could be supplied in large numbers very quickly. We have been telling people in North America they need to be wearing masks since February 21st. We've been advising people to wear masks with airtight seals, eye coverings with airtight seals and avoiding all contact with people outside their homes as much as possible since March 11th and showing them how. We've been trying to get grocery stores to require customers and staff to wear masks. We talked to people at the Emergency Operations Center for the Western Hemisphere branch of the World Health Organization to tell them we have a way to create millions of masks (with enough volunteers making them).  We mentioned this to officials at provincial and national governments.

We are getting almost zero reaction to all of this. Some of these messages have probably not even been read because officials are overwhelmed with the crisis. Nonetheless, we have some solutions that can help. Volunteers can help spread the word, make masks and other equipment, and even help with contact tracing. Is there anyone out there at any hospital or government anywhere in the world who wants our help? More volunteers would be good, too.",1585699442

0 of the 7 G7 countries have a nationalized telecom and for good reason. Just open up competition and allow for foreign carriers to buy our telecom.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O presidente do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal), Dias Toffoli, preparou um projeto de lei encampado pelo Senado para suspender desde o pagamento de aluguéis até a devolução de mercadorias adquiridas pela internet durante a pandemia do coronavírus.

 O projeto foi apresentado pelo senador Antonio Anastasia (PSD-MG) nesta terça-feira (31), terá relatoria de Simone Tebet (MDB-MS) e existe consenso para que seja aprovado nas duas Casas até a próxima semana em regime de urgência.

 A ideia, segundo assessores de Toffoli, é organizar as relações privadas definidas em contratos que, na crise, precisam ser alteradas ou até interrompidas temporariamente sem que isso gere ações judiciais. Somente ficam fora os casos de empresas em [recuperação judicial](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/cnj-recomenda-flexibilizar-recuperacoes-judiciais-de-empresas-por-crise-do-coronavirus.shtml) e os serviços regulados (como [água e energia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/neoenergia-oferece-parcelamento-da-conta-de-luz-em-12-vezes-apos-coronavirus.shtml)).

 Essa espécie de “pausa legal” foi definida de 20 de março (quando teve início o confinamento) até 20 de outubro, tempo previsto para que a crise tenha se dissipado. Após esse prazo, todas as regras suspensas voltam à vigência normalmente.

 Pelo projeto, inquilinos que tiverem redução de jornada ou redução salarial, poderão negociar com o proprietário do imóvel a suspensão total ou parcial do pagamento do aluguel até o final de outubro —prazo máximo da vigência dessa nova lei.

  O saldo devedor será parcelado em cinco vezes e cada parcela (equivalente a 20% da dívida) incorporada ao aluguel a partir de novembro até a quitação, em março de 2021.

 Nesse período, [ações de despejo ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2020/03/nova-york-tem-queda-nos-despejos-apos-criar-lei-do-aluguel-para-proteger-inquilinos.shtml)não poderão movidas. A desocupação de imóveis alugados só poderá ser feita se o proprietário precisar do local como moradia.

 [Os síndicos poderão proibir festas e reuniões, fechar áreas do condomínio](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/sao-paulo/2020/03/condominio-pode-fechar-areas-comuns-para-evitar-coronavirus.shtml) e vetar até o uso de vagas por visitantes. Poderá, no entanto, ser destituído se não prestar contas.

 Arrendamentos agrários também terão seus prazos de renovação ou cancelamento flexibilizados nesse período. E a proibição para que estrangeiros façam esse tipo de negócio ficará suspensa.

 “O ministro Toffoli preparou esse projeto com uma equipe dos mais gabaritados professores e juristas do país. Encampamos porque entendemos ser uma forma de evitar a judicialização nesse momento em que as pessoas precisam ficar em isolamento”, disse Anastasia à **Folha**. “Também barra uma série de projetos mais específicos nessa linha que tramitam tanto no Senado quanto na Câmara.”

 Sem a colaboração de representantes do Executivo, “que não se interessaram” segundo colaboradores de Toffoli, essa iniciativa representa mais um sinal da [união de forças entre Legislativo e Judiciário](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/03/congresso-quer-negociacao-direta-com-ministros-e-protagonismo-na-crise-do-coronavirus.shtml) diante de um governo desgastado no combate ao conoravírus.

 Ao mesmo tempo em que pausa ações judiciais, o projeto flexibiliza o arcabouço jurídico de forma tão ampla que faz projetos de lei específicos (como os que tratam da relação entre correntista e banco) perderem o objeto.

 Para o Congresso, isso é bom porque libera a pauta para assuntos mais urgentes no combate ao vírus.

 O projeto também modifica a rotina das empresas. Reuniões e assembleias poderão ser feitas à distância por [videoconferência ](https://aovivo.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/03/30/5896-acompanhe-todas-as-informacoes-sobre-a-pandemia-de-coronavirus.shtml#post399536)e os votos de diretoria enviados por e-mail. No caso das companhias abertas, caberá à CVM (Comissão de Valores Imobiliários) regulamentar esses procedimentos.

 Também será permitido que empresas possam distribuir lucros e dividendos vencidos neste ano mesmo que isso não esteja previsto no estatuto da companhia.

 O texto suspende até regras do Código de Defesa do Consumidor. Compras feitas pela internet, por exemplo, só poderão ser devolvidas a partir do final de outubro devido às dificuldades de logísticas no país.

 Caminhões poderão trafegar pelas rodovias com excesso de carga, desde que isso não comprometa a segurança. Anteriormente, a infração era punida com multa.

 A flexibilização levou em conta as restrições de circulação impostas em muitos locais por meio [decretos municipais ou até estaduais](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/03/veja-os-decretos-que-fecharam-comercio-e-escolas-no-pais-por-coronavirus.shtml).

 Infrações concorrenciais, como o uso de logística da concorrência ou sinergias entre empresas, não serão punidas. Mesmo irregularidades passíveis de penalidades serão analisadas sob a óptica da pandemia.

 A [Lei de Proteção de Dados](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/ronaldolemos/2020/03/a-protecao-de-dados-e-a-covid-19.shtml) ganhou sobrevida de 18 meses para que o governo possa, depois de superada a crise, montar a agência que será responsável pela regulação desse segmento.

 Nos processos familiares de sucessão, partilha e inventário, os prazos serão congelados. O atraso no pagamento de [pensão alimentícia](https://blogdofred.blogfolha.uol.com.br/?p=46541) resultará em prisão domiciliar.

 Para Toffoli, a inspiração desse projeto foi a Lei de Faillot que, em 1918, já no final da Primeira Guerra Mundial, foi apresentada pelo deputado que lhe deu nome e criou regras excepcionais abrindo caminho para o que se chamou de “teoria da imprevisão” no Direito francês.

 Na exposição de motivos, o senador Anastasia aponta que “tanto o Código Civil quanto o Código de Defesa do Consumidor possuem regras adequadas para resolver ou revisar contratos por imprevisão, no primeiro caso, e onerosidade excessiva, no segundo. É preciso agora conter os excessos em nome da ocorrência do caso fortuito e da força maior.”

 Para redigir o projeto, Toffoli contou com o apoio de diversos professores de Direito da USP, PUC-SP, da UFPR e da UFSC. Na coordenação técnica, o time contou com o ministro do STJ Antonio Carlos Ferreira e do Conselheiro Nacional do Ministério Público e professor da USP Otavio Luiz Rodrigues Jr.

 “O objetivo é garantir segurança jurídica em um tempo de incertezas. Concede proteção a locatários, evita prescrição, e prestigia soluções legislativas para problemas judiciais”, disse Rodrigues Jr.",1585699444

She is specifically tying the deaths in this country to him, which I admit may not be completely accurate.  

Trump's Ukraine deal was shady, but they couldn't prove anything so I'll have to accept that.  However, calling the pandemic a hoax?  It was being reported in news worldwide at the time he claimed it was a hoax.  It would have been somewhat reasonable for him to underestimate the severity of the pandemic and its chances of reaching the US, but calling it a hoax without reasonable proof was just irresponsible.  

It's okay for him to admit that he doesn't know something: that's when he should collaborate with people who do have that knowledge, like the CDC.  But when he's called out for a mistake, he doubles down and insists that he's right and that everyone else is reporting fake news.   

Yeah, she went over the top.  Like I said, I don't do death threats.  I would love for Trump to step down as President: he can go back to his millions and his hotels and start his new post-presidential Apprentice show for all that I care.  I just don't think he's suited for this job.",1585699445

"investing","t5_2qhhq","**Hi, welcome to /r/investing. Please note that as a topic focused subreddit we have higher posting standards than much of Reddit. If you are new here please take the time to review the rules and take special note of the following standards**

**1) Please direct all advice requests and beginner questions to the stickied daily threads.** If this post is asking for advice or a beginner question it will likely be removed. Additionally if your question is specific to a broker or easily found on google it will likely be removed. Please direct those questions to your broker.

**2) Important: /r/investing operates a zero tolerance policy for violations of our political posting guidelines so please review them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cyee69/formal_posting_guidelines_for_political_topics/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/escewo/temporary_rule_change_what_happens_to_stocks_if/). Violations will result in a minimum 30 and likely 60 day ban upon first instance.  Note simply arguing over off topic politics is sufficient to warrant a ban - please review the linked threads before posting as this post serves as your only warning.**

**3) This is an open forum but we expect you to conduct yourself like an adult. Disagree, argue, criticize but do not use personal attacks.**

We have heard the criticism that our previous automoderator comment bot was annoying, cumbersome, and overly long.

For that we would like to sincerely apologize to all who were impacted by the hardships of bloated comment sections and threads that were difficult to parse though.

That being said, we want to also take this time to recognize that many feel that giving special privileges to black people, people of color, and white allies on a subreddit devoted to black people and black culture is harmful and bigoted.

In response, we do want to take this time to ensure that /r/BlackPeopleTwitter is an inclusive environment for all participants, particularly the much-oppressed group of straight white male Redditors. 

With the recent closures of spaces such as /r/GamersRiseUp and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, many of these oppressed Redditors are currently lost and without a home on this website.

In order to make these Redditors feel more welcome on /r/BlackPeopleTwitter, we want to sincerely recognize the added value of these voices on this subreddit.

To do so, we encourage you to search out comments by these Redditors and upvote them. To find the best of these voices, we suggest that you sort this post’s comment section by controversial and look for comments that have been automatically collapsed by Reddit’s Crowd Control feature.  If you think it is a particularly worthy comment, please hit the ""report"" button to bring it to moderator attention.

**Note, if you have black privilege, or if you are a person of color or ally, and have no need for this increased visibility, please click here and follow these instructions: https://redd.it/bfqeee.**

In addition to this effort to raise up the voices of these oppressed people, we have also opened new moderator applications strictly for those who are melanin deprived.

You can submit your application using the following google form link to apply: https://forms.gle/4zYpF1UhCJju91Wb8

For more information about /r/BlackPeopleTwitter's work to encourage diversity on this subreddit, see here: https://redd.it/frql0r.

In the meantime, we at /r/BlackPeopleTwitter will continue fighting on behalf of those who desire to have raisins in their potato salad.

Thank you for your time and have a nice day.

Currently Vic is trying to appeal losing his lawsuit, but in the opinions of various other lawyers, the vast majority say the appeal is doomed to fail and isn't really going to fix Vic's career.

Now they are discussing telling the general public to go ahead and wear them, but they can't do that unless the supply is there, because then people will buy up what's left and the hospital staff will not have them (the people at the most risk).  Now all I see is everyone saying ""they said masks won't help, what changed?""

No, ya dipshits, they didn't say that, people on reddit posted misleading titles saying they said that, the media was saying masks don't work, and so did some government officials who are just as bad at listening as you all are.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","Thanks for the correction, I thought the 2018 Z4s sold were the E89, even then that’s 502 sold in the last model year in 2017.

And I’m not being naive to it at all, everyone, including even Toyota, knew that their decision to compromise the car would hurt a percentage of their potential sales, but they had enough data about the market to accurately project their sales goals for the Supra, which they met (in contrast to the underwhelming LC).

Sure the sales are abysmal in comparison to previous Z4’s, but it’s not like today’s market is dying for another 50k+ 2 seat sports car either. The height of the recession was **TEN** years ago. Buying trends, demographics and attitudes have changed dramatically. Look at the sales for the Z4, Cayman, TT, F-Type, or SLC last year, it’s at an all time low across the board.
None of those sold more than 3000 units in 2019 all while offering various trim and pricing options. On top of that, sports cars are not only competing with each other, but also competing in a crowded performance market.

Your point on the first model year being the best, that’s definitely true, but Toyota didn’t follow the same strategy here in the US that most other cars do.  It was essentially released with a one engine option with a limited color selection, and a “launch edition”.  Every other car above had at least 2 different engine options, price points, and trims at launch. It’s also the only car next to the Cayman that’s available only as a coupe, whereas the others offer convertible options.

At the end of the day, there were buyers who still liked the Supra regardless of the badge. Badge engineering is a factor, but the least of the Toyota’s issues when it comes to the Supra’s sales. It has more to do with the crowded segment and lack of demand.",1585699447

I literally didn't even speak to racism at all in my comment, so don't come in and label me as a racist ""white boy"" so you can get special time feelings in your tummy. 

Since I have to spell it out for you, I don't condone racism, I don't support racism, and I myself am far from a racist. I think half the Tarkov names are comedic gold. Sure I think the one in the OP is pretty disrespectful, but I honestly couldn't give two shits about what someone on the internet said to offend me/someone.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;The United States is in a compact of free association with the Marshall Islands, so even if the US gave up it's claim on the island, they still have the authority to keep the base. 

You can look at numerous other examples, Guantanamo Bay being the most famous one probably. The base is on internationally recognised Cuban territory and Cuba has called for the US to leave for what, 70 years now? Well, how's it looking, are they still there?

&gt; Also, I stole your wallet with a gun to your head, it is cool because im 'militarily defending my claim'?

Who said it was cool? I'm simply pointing out that if two (or more nations) lay claim to some territory, the one with the stronger military/economy usually wins. I don't like it but that's how it has been throughout history, don't blame me for the reality we live in lol.

And the reason I'm pointing it out is because most Redditors don't read beyond headlines. You can already see in response to me, someone claimed that the UN recognised the reefs as belonging to the Philippines. That's factually wrong. Surely you would point out to people who wrongly believe the UN recognised the reefs as Chinese territory that this is factually wrong, so why be upset over someone pointing out the UN doesn't recognise it as Filipino territory either?

All I'm doing is pointing out the status of the territory and drawing a comparison to other disputed territories that Redditors might be more familiar with.",1585699449

I earn $125-$175 from it weekly before tax

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","He wasn't committed because of that. He had a host of other problems and couldn't take criticism. His behaviour was erratic, and almost schizophrenic. The media attention from his publications may have catalysed his condition, but it didn't cause it. He was committed because of his incredible deterioration, not because of the hand washing.



&gt; Beginning in 1861, Semmelweis suffered from various nervous complaints. He suffered from severe depression and became absentminded. Paintings from 1857 to 1864 show a progression of aging.[M] He turned every conversation to the topic of childbed fever. 

&gt;After a number of unfavorable foreign reviews of his 1861 book, Semmelweis lashed out against his critics in a series of Open Letters.[N] They were addressed to various prominent European obstetricians, including Späth, Scanzoni, Siebold, and to ""all obstetricians"". They were full of bitterness, desperation, and fury and were ""highly polemical and superlatively offensive"",[51] at times denouncing his critics as irresponsible murderers[52] or ignoramuses.[53] He also called upon Siebold to arrange a meeting of German obstetricians somewhere in Germany to provide a forum for discussions on puerperal fever, where he would stay ""until all have been converted to his theory.""[45]

&gt;In mid-1865, his public behaviour became exasperating and embarrassing to his associates. He also began to drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes in the company of a prostitute; and his wife noticed changes in his sexual behavior. On July 13, 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit Semmelweis's behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.[54]


Unfortunately, being committed was what killed him, and treatment of the insane was akin to torture. It's a sad ending to his story. He was clearly extremely passionate, and he was right to be so, but he was also deeply troubled and afflicted by psychoses that we know are treatable, at least today.",1585699451

"insurgency","t5_2s4cy","You might want to try using a lighter loadout. I also recommend playing coop first and foremost as you will on average be alive longer and have more playtime to get used to the game.

"" ...gun play feels so clunky and unrealistic. Everything feels so slow and unresponsive."" 

The heavier your character, several different things happen

* Slower movement
* Longer ads time
* Faster stamina drain when running

Try using light armor with no backpack and whatever else you like for weapons. You'll move much faster and aim much quicker.

&amp;#x200B;

""I noticed that character models are really inconsistent, as I've killed people behind walls and I've been killed while hugging a wall.""

You do know that the game has bullet penetration right? Your camera is in the center of your model, people will be able to see your arms/sides sooner if they are lean peeking you.

&amp;#x200B;

""Kills are really unsatisfying as if feels like I'm firing a rail gun into a sponge, no hit feedback or satisfying graphics.""

The game does indeed have a very fast TTK, everyone dies very fast. There are also quite blatant and decorative hit responses all over this game. From blood splatters on walls, the kevlar puffs when you hit armor, the massive blood bursts when you hit a killing shot. You might need to pay closer attention to actually notice these though in the heat of combat?

&amp;#x200B;

Overall you should probably go jump into coop and play more, it's not super easy to get into and getting used to the movement/momentum/mechanics can be daunting and feel annoying at times.",1585699451

Nash held the WCW title for a combined of 88 days. Nash was never pushed as ""the"" guy in WCW. He was in the WWF (even if HBK/Hart overshadowed him...just like Hogan/Goldberg did in WCW).

Stone Cold wrestled in TWO matches for ECW. He lost both of them. Let's not overstate his time with ECW.

Rock was a WWF product-there's no getting around that. Hes also the biggest star in the history of the wrestling industry.

Cena's success isn't on the same level as Hogan, Austin or Rock...but it is bigger than anybody Bischoff created. Goldberg's probably the biggest (and only really big) name that Bischoff managed to create from 94 to 01. That's pretty pathetic.

Oh and let's not even get into how he messed up Bret Hart's arrival...guest referee as his debut? Give me a break.

Bischoff had a formula with nWo that worked for a while but wore out it's welcome. New challenger arrives and threatens Hogan for the title...somebody betrays them and joins the nWo so Hogan can retain the title. It got boring so he tried to shake things up with...the Wolfpack (which I actually liked but many people didn't)....got stale again so he shook things up by combining them and and that point nobody cared anymore.",1585699452

Tsukemen ramen in Tokyo (Menya Itto, Fuunji or Rokurinsha since it’s much more convenient and cheaper). We’ll go 2-3 times on each 2-3 day trip. 

Favorite in Europe: 
Swedish meatballs, mashed potatoes and lingonberries at Bullen - Två Krögare in Malmö, Sweden. I’ve taken two friends there and it’s hands down the best meatballs any of us have ever had. Worth the train ride from Copenhagen.

Runners up:

Mussels, frites and speculoos tiramisu in Brussels at Au Vieux. We fought over the last bite of the tiramisu.

A homemade meal outside Taipei. My old exchange student was going to come downtown to get hot pot since I was only there 2 days, but once her mom heard I was there by myself she insisted I come over. So I hopped on the high speed train, ate a bunch, then we went on a short hike! Stopped at a roadside restaurant afterward for Hakka style noodles which were also incredible.

Blueberry pierogi, cabbage rolls and sausage at Radio Cafe in Warsaw. The owner was delightful with fun stories and the food was hearty and comforting.

It all comes down to if they think it is worth making profits in the short run but possibly losing in the long run. And I respect their choice either way. I just probably wouldn't buy from them again. There's always gonna be companies that don't do that because they think it's wrong, or for good PR. That's how the free market works.

➤ A quick search of someone's reddit username on the [Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php) and their Steam profile on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/) &amp; [SteamTrades](https://www.steamtrades.com/) is absolutely recommended before committing to a trade. Always copy-paste into these websites instead of typing; `NOLIfe` can be easily misinterpreted or misrepresented as `NOLlfe` or `N0LIfe`.
***
➤ Cryptocurrencies and PayPal personal payments (friends &amp; family) are as good as irreversible in nature; you can not get your money back once it's sent. PayPal purchase payments (goods &amp; services) offer a certain degree of protection to buyers for a nominal fee; you can dispute such payments if in case something goes wrong with the trade.
***
➤ For your own good, spend a few minutes going through [this safety guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/wiki/safetrading) that outlines how best you can protect yourself against scammers and common scam tactics. Ignoring this recommendation could very well result in you getting scammed; you have been warned.
***
➤ We have announced a few rule changes in [this town hall thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/b6vxwt/announcement_sgs_accepting_moderator_applications/); read through the post at-least once to avoid getting banned because of the new policies in place.

They edit there posts every time anything happens, like seriously, no one cares that you got, and I quote, ‘Thanks for the updoots kind strangers, I never expected this to blow up so much’ or ‘Thanks for the gold kind stranger’, I can stress enough how little anyone cares.

I'll also get the seats reupholstered too. I have Focal Audio Auditor speakers with a 12"" Memphis Mojo sub with a custom box my dad and I made.

I think it's because they represent women who can be badass, tough, and smart, but also sexy at the same time.

When these characters are designed, (probably) by men, they probably aren't intended to be that way, but that is how I perceive them as characters and as women, so they're going to be both badass and sexy and it's okay.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O presidente da Câmara dos Deputados, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), afirmou nesta terça-feira (31) que o calendário estabelecido pelo governo para o pagamento do [auxílio de R$ 600](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/bolsonaro-promete-sancionar-auxilio-de-r-600-para-coronavirus-ainda-nesta-terca.shtml) não parece o de um apoio emergencial.

 Maia fez as declarações antes do início de uma sessão virtual na qual os deputados apreciarão projetos de [enfrentamento ao coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/coronavirus/), como a PEC (Proposta de Emenda à Constituição) que segrega o orçamento e o texto que adia a declaração do Imposto de Renda.

Segundo o Ministério da Cidadania, o auxílio emergencial deve ser liberado primeiro para quem recebe o Bolsa Família. Esse grupo já está na base de dados do governo, o que agiliza o repasse.

 A previsão é que o calendário de pagamentos do Bolsa Família [comece em 16 de abril](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/grana/2020/03/informais-vao-receber-auxilio-emergencial-de-r-600-a-partir-de-16-de-abril.shtml).

 “Se é apoio emergencial, 16 de abril não parece tão emergencial para os brasileiros que estão precisando dos recursos”, criticou.

  Para o deputado, o governo tem condições de fazer um mutirão e unificar estruturas, mesmo de forma remota, para organizar o pagamento do auxílio antes dessa data.

 “A palavra emergencial não me parece, para uma crise do tamanho que a gente está vivendo, que aguardar até 16 de abril é a melhor solução”.

 Maia também falou sobre a demora para a sanção presidencial ao projeto do auxílio emergencial. Segundo o presidente da Câmara, o Planalto deve estar avaliando o lastro técnico e o impacto fiscal para sancionar o texto.

“Mas eu não acho que uma matéria como essa, que todos sabem que é urgente, que ela possa esperar muito tempo”, afirmou.

 “Acho que o governo certamente já deve estar avaliando a hipótese de sancionar ainda hoje [terça]. Acho que isso é o que todos estão esperando, principalmente os que hoje já não têm mais renda, já perderam as suas condições de trabalho pela crise do coronavírus”.

 As regras aprovadas para o voucher permitem que o beneficiário troque temporariamente o Bolsa Família pelo valor de R$ 600 destinado a trabalhadores informais, desempregado e microempreendedores individuais. O benefício médio do Bolsa Família gira em torno de R$ 200. A substituição vale apenas enquanto durar o auxílio emergencial.

 O governo ainda finaliza a operação para os repasses temporários. O Cadastro Único também reúne dados de beneficiários de outros programas sociais e será usado para facilitar a transferência do valor.

 Depois dessa fase, a expectativa é que microempreendedores e trabalhadores autônomos que contribuem para o INSS (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social) sejam atendidos. Por serem cadastrados na Previdência Social, podem ser identificados.

 O maior desafio é listar trabalhadores informais e desempregos fora dessas bases de dados do governo.

 “Os informais estão à margem de qualquer cruzamento de dados, mas para eles haverá uma solução tecnológica, ainda em desenvolvimento”, disse o ministro Onyx Lorenzoni (Cidadania), nesta segunda-feira (30).

 Onyx reforça o pedido para que as pessoas não procurem bancos, lotéricas e CRAS (Centro de Referência de Assistência Social) até que o formato da solicitação do voucher seja definido.",1585699456

"politics","t5_2cneq","Fifty years ago, a postal worker strike halted mail delivery. The eight-day strike, carried out by 150,000 letter carriers across 30 cities, prompted then-President Richard Nixon to declare an emergency and send in the National Guard to deliver mail. 

“The United States Postal System is a vital element of our entire communications system. The poor depend heavily upon it for medical services and also for government assistance,” Nixon said in an address to the nation. “Veterans depend on it for their compensation checks. The elderly depend on it for their Social Security checks.” 

Today, the Postal Service is just as essential: It delivers about 1 million lifesaving medications each year and serves as the only delivery link to Americans living in rural areas. Working with other delivery services like UPS, the agency supports $1.7 trillion in sales and 7.3 million private sector workers year, and this year will prove essential to delivering the 2020 Census to citizens as well as any vote-by-mail initiatives. The USPS is the federal government’s most favorably viewed agency, with an approval rating of 90%.

Yet once again, the USPS is in crisis mode.

With a negative net worth of $65 billion and an additional $140 billion in unfunded liabilities, the USPS originally expected to run out of liquidity by 2021 without intervention. That has accelerated rapidly because of COVID-19. Fewer people and businesses are sending mail because of the outbreak, which could hasten the decline of the Postal Service and close its doors as early as June, officials warned. 

Without government intervention, the post office is facing the same hurdle as other businesses are right now: There’s not enough cash to keep operations going.

First class and commercial mail volume, which brought in about $41 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2019, has dropped at a rapid clip since the virus spread across the U.S., according to the Postal Service. This downward trajectory is expected to continue, with mail volume falling lower than it did during the 1930s Depression. USPS estimates total revenue losses between $8 billion and $17 billion between now and the end of fiscal year 2020 as a result of the crisis.

While package delivery has increased during the crisis, “revenue growth in our package business will never be enough to offset imbalances in the Postal Service’s business model,” said Postmaster General and CEO Megan Brennan in November. 

But the USPS has also been hemorrhaging money, largely owing to a piece of 2006 legislation, championed by the George W. Bush administration and congressional Republicans, that requires the Postal Service to pre-fund all future retiree health benefits, amounting to at least $5.5 billion annually. That edict, according to Brennan, has led to 80% of the agency’s losses. As a result of the lack of revenue, the Trump administration has suggested on multiple occasions that parts of the postal service be sold to private industry. 

While the post office has not been funded by taxpayer dollars since the early 1980s, some in Congress—on both the left and the right—pushed for a bailout of the Postal Service as part of the recently passed $2 trillion stimulus package, the largest relief package in U.S. history. The original House bill included a $25 billion appropriation intended to help fund the agency and eliminate its $11 billion in outstanding debt. The measure would also eliminate the USPS’s $3 billion annual borrowing cap. 

While the plan passed through the House, the Republican-majority Senate rejected the funding, and the final bill, signed by the President on Friday, only granted the USPS access to a $10 billion Treasury loan—no direct cash. 

“A collapse of the Postal Service at this crucial moment would severely undermine both our fight to defeat the COVID-19 virus as well as the effort to stabilize our economy,” said the National Association of Letter Carriers, a postal worker union, in a statement.

Just last week, President Donald Trump said that the Postal Service was essential to keeping goods flowing to households who were self-quarantining. In many areas of rural America, the USPS is the only mail option and provides last mile delivery for private companies. That means that the Postal Service alone will have the ability to adequately distribute the individual stimulus checks that Congress approved for Americans in the bailout package.

“Republicans pressed for hundreds of billions of dollars in massive bailouts to all kinds of large businesses and corporations, including $17 billion to Boeing and other companies. Yet they refused to give the Postal Service anything but increased borrowing authority,” said Maloney. “The White House and Senate Republicans…have wanted to privatize the Postal Service for years, but exploiting the coronavirus crisis in order to do so [is] a new low.”

In total about $500 billion was handed out to private corporations, with no money going to the Postal Service. 

A closure of the Postal Service is uncharted territory, but it’s not impossible, said USPS spokesman David Partenheimer in a statement. “The Postal Service remains concerned that this measure will be insufficient to enable the Postal Service to withstand the significant downturn in our business that could directly result from the pandemic,” he said. “Under a worst-case scenario, such [a] downturn could result in the Postal Service having insufficient liquidity to continue operations.”

The USPS currently employs about 630,000 workers, and without funding there could be massive layoffs and the closing of certain offices in rural areas. Congress could also mandate that certain parts of the service be sold to private industry, as the Trump administration has suggested on numerous occasions.

“What would happen tomorrow in the wake of this pandemic if the Postal Service announced tomorrow that they were going out of businesses and they were laying off all their workers?” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) asked in a statement.

There is talk of a fourth stimulus package, and Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents about 250,000 postal workers, is holding out hope that there will be some support included in the next round of funding.

“It’s absolutely necessary that it include funds—as House proposals earlier this week did—to keep the mail and e-commerce moving until the economy begins to recover,” he said in a statement. “Simply having access to more debt from the Treasury—at the Secretary’s discretion—as included in the third stimulus, is an inadequate solution.”

The Postal Service Board of Governors will convene in a virtual meeting on Wednesday, where they are expected to discuss borrowing more money and how they intend to stay afloat amid COVID-19. 

Postal employees are considered essential and will continue to work as the virus spreads across the country.

“It’s outrageous that the stimulus bill passed by Congress doesn’t include any financial support for the USPS, including needed funds to provide for the safety of workers and the mailing public,” said Dimondstein.

As of Friday, the USPS confirmed that 111 of its employees had tested positive for COVID-19.

She's probably the least scummy of everyone shown, imo. I'm not convinced she killed her husband. I think his 'one last big job' likely just backfired and got him killed.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Yes I am aware that we were the first NHL Organization to use it ( first used in Canadian junior hockey leagues and then adopted by Colorado Rockies which was then inherited by us). However IMO, when you introduce something into the public and then a million other people copy you it definitely mitigates how unique/original it is. 

For instance let’s take a look at the 80’s Glam/Hair metal movement. The fashionable/physical look of the bands and their distinguishable sound was arguably established by bands like Van Halen and Motley Crue. Eventually tons of copycat glam metal bands popped out of the wood work and the music industry became so god damn saturated with bands of that genre that most people got sick of it (which is why the scene died pretty much by 1990) and looked for other bands that were the antithesis of that. Something unique and fresh (insert grunge band here). 

So yeah I stand by my reasoning. We introduced it and then other sports leagues copied it. Eventually there were multiple teams in most major sports leagues that used this song including more than half of the NHL. At that point people kinda don’t care who established the trend but they will acknowledge that it is overused and no longer original. This is just kinda how cultural trends work in contemporary society. 

Then again just my two cents.",1585699457

quick fact check - the Youtuber's site never shows him harming any cats ever, there is a single one post [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/23956891?hl=en](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/23956891?hl=en) by a Youtube user called PS2020 that only exists once and that is to post this complaint... this is the same complaint that is being reworded into the reddit post today and yesterday that added screenshots from the Youtube channel. if you go to the channel in dispute, it is [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCplA3-GAPVEncXBWvOnNYYg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCplA3-GAPVEncXBWvOnNYYg), you will not find a single abuse of any animals in the video. and it is not the same cat at all... i will say that Bato TV says America but the gentleman and the pictures do not look like they are taken from the US. every single thing accusing this Bato is bullshit, and right now there are about a 1,000 redditors posting comments (""[murderer](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgznXOKRr3yyaKfxVNp4AaABCQ)"") over in Youtube having following this weirdly false trail. the videos show no abuse at all, go there, watch them and then come back here... seriously go to that channel, watch the videos and come back here...

imho everyone replying and getting worked up on this has been played... i will say my mildly earlier was just based on some guy killing cats and that getting put into mildly but now that i did my own research i am fully convinced this is all one hater working a guy. where is the abuse?",1585699457

"santarosa","t5_2s88z","I think it's worth pointing out that Santa Rosa is a city with a bit of an identity crisis. For everyone who recognizes it as a small city, there's another who still thinks of it as a little farm town. What this has ultimately resulted in is SR having a lot of the problems of a city, but without much of the fun. For all the traffic, noise, tight housing market, homelessness, etc. you'll see and deal with, what you'll get for it might feel more similar to a smaller, more rural spot.  On a personal note, I think this is why so many people here identify much closer to Sonoma County as opposed to the city itself, with the mentality of ""Well, there ain't much going on here so I'll just hang out in Sebastopol, Petaluma, Bodega, etc"" being used as sort of a compensation for that. Obviously we're not a metropolis or anything, so it makes sense that the surrounding area is part of the draw. However, we've also gotten a bit too big to be just ""another lil' town in the county"", which in turn can sometimes lead to some bedroom community vibes. 

That being said, I'm not trying to discredit Santa Rosa or your decision to move here, think of this is more of a ""head up"" because, like anything, there's always room for improvement. But, as others have pointed out, there's a lot a really great reasons to call SR home, especially if the outdoors and restaurant/bar scenes are your thing, and we welcome you with open arms!",1585699457

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T and A for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

I'm lucky in that one of my partners (I'm poly) is temporarily staying with me during the lockdown. But my other partner is a LDR, and it can be very difficult to lock down a time to talk with her. Even during the best of times.
 
It's tricky when anxiety makes you want to reach out, and him want to close off.
 
Being home alone is not conducive to a breakup. Lets your mind run unimpeded over the same thoughts. Typical advice like finding a rebound date is difficult in quarantine. 
 
I would suggest talking to friends, writing your thoughts, and trying mindful mediation. I know that's all obvious but it can help. You said there were lots of issues. Remind yourself of them. Then let things lay. 

Give yourself space and allow yourself to be sad. Don't try to fix things. Be honest about what you feel, buy don't wallow in it.

I really wish they would spend time on the fucking UX of this app. Its terrible AF. Its following the same path as sketch where they encourage 3rd party developers to create simple shit they should have added themselves. Everytime a new plugin developer comes up with some cool shit for elementor you are sure as shit gonna see it in the pro version next and then that plugin becomes redundant. I hope elementor offers some monetary reward to these developers rather than ripping of their ideas and then creating a shittier version. I am looking at you style kits and feel for what has happened.

We need better support for responsive, you know the most important feature we all want. Having 3 viewpoints based on 2012 screens is SHIT.

But hey lets oversell shit no one really wants and keep ignoring the real users request.

Sorry for the rant but i love elementor but boy its frustrating because its a victim of sudden growth and funding which means the marketing is turned up to 11 and the core development of the app suffers because they need to push shit that sells to get another rpound of spicy investment.",1585699461

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","It's teams of toxic people that support each other in the attitude. It also creates a reinforcement, because anyone not supporting the toxicity becomes the target.  


Many of them are only toxic because of the environment. They are also often, but not always, much younger than you assume. Maturity of course comes with age, and the veil of anonymity allows the separation of empathy from instinct. It is instinctual to want to be part of the strongest tribe, and one of the ways weak tribes build themselves up is by putting other tribes down, in whatever aspect that might be.  


Additionally, being toxic towards other players can be done with the goal of ""tilting"" the other players. a player who is ""tilted"" plays badly due to emotion. Some players depend on this to win, as skill is secondary if you can make your opponent ignore their skill and practice in favor of revenge.  


One more. A toxic team, even to each other, can still communicate effectively, and with little issue, as long as each member is both okay with and participating in the toxicity. many small friend groups consider some types of hostility friendly banter, and forget that other people might be unaware of a lack of hostility. Anonymity makes even those who are often very empathetic to the plights of others unable to tell how they are making others feel and so look to their peers for a confirmation. Those peers enjoy upsetting others, and so reinforce the perceived humor of the situation.  


TLDR: most don't know they're doing wrong, or disagree about what constitutes bad or wrong behavior. The others are purposely toxic in order to entertain themselves, but they're honestly pretty rare.",1585699462
