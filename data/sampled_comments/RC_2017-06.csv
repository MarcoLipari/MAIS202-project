"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","&gt;Should we allow medical treatment to those who will spread genetic predispositions to disease or disorders?

To me that question is a little odd, because if you value life but do not value creating more life with potential health problems, then the question should be ""Should we allow medical treatment to those who will spread genetic predispositions to disease or disorders **without also sterilizing the people in question**?"", since they should still be helped to survive, because we like people surviving.

If you don't value life... why do you care if some people have genetic disorders?

&gt;Is Modern Medicine actually helping humanity by allowing medical treatment to said population?

Yes, because humanity would have more suffering and more people dying otherwise, modern medicine makes it so that that does not happen, which is nice. If you do not agree with this, I think you need to define ""help"" for the purposes of this discussion.

&gt;Is Modern Medicine actually ""trumping"" Natural Selection at all?

[Yeah, actually](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38210837). 

&gt;Could Natural Selection, in reality, do better than Modern Medicine at eliminating genetic predispositions?

Nope. Because natural selection doesn't actually get rid of any ""undesirable"" traits, it gets rid of traits that hinder reproduction. So anything you get after you would typically have children is kind of irrelevant (which is to say, for example, heart disease in your 40s would still be carried down to your kids, because most people have children before they're 40).

If you do this the first few turns, you go into turn 3 with 11-12 fate which gives you an explosive board state that you should be able to keep in play the rest of the game. This is how I've been playing in test games and it's very effective.

And yeah, I hate the looks of this freaking cooler. Lol, I was going to paint it black and white or something other than the brown. The NZXT Kraken X62 seems to be fairly popular and would be able to match whatever color scheme I had going on at the time. It's just a bit more expensive.

"ContagiousLaughter","t5_2u2bh","The Rift controllers have capacitive sensors on the buttons and triggers, and can detect when a finger is on a button, near a button, or completely off a button in order to give a loose representation of a person's finger positions in VR.  The Vive has capacitive sensors as well, though only on the touchpad as far as I recall.

For games that don't fully utilize a Rift's capacitive sensors though, gestures are sometimes possible just through certain button presses, game dependent.  In the game in this video (Star Trek: Bridge Crew), interacting with the ships interfaces is done by pressing trigger, and the cupped hands are actually just the default hand orientation.",1496275203

Trash talk is 100% in sport, competitive, casual and e-sports. In game of football before a penalty some goalkeepers might try and play mind games with you(think Julio Cesar vs Zlatan), when Ibra scored the penalty he then played games with Julio Cesar's mind.

When I played football(UK not the American ""football"") I played as a CDM and I'd slip word into the oppositions attackers ear and hit them early with a hard tackle. On more timid players they would try and avoid me for the rest of the game because I went through them early.

250g full fat milk

475g of bread flour 

25g Dutched cocoa (not the regular or 'natural' version you might find by Hershey) 

40g caster sugar 

10g salt 

2 large eggs 

A bit of coffee (still experimenting with exactly the best way, but I've tried both a tablespoon of instant or a shot of espresso chilled and thought both worked well and both better than without) 

Warm milk (not hot and not cold) - add yeast and some of the sugar 

Rub butter into flour (if you're using fresh yeast you can just add it here instead of above) 

Add rest of sugar and salt - then eggs and milk 

Let proove - about an hour - better yet is overnight in the fridge 

Roll out onto a floured surface and cut into doughnuts - let rise for about another 45-60 min. 

Try not to malform them as you dip into the oil - which should be at 180 C and which you should watch carefully as it will drop. 45 seconds (give or take) per side should do it. 

As for toppings, powdered sugar, strawberry jam, or a chocolate glaze work great (I highly really like Alton browns recipe https://www.google.com/amp/www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/chocolate-doughnut-glaze-recipe-1943022.amp )

You can close windows near the cooler, and open others at the far end of the house.  The air will be forced to travel the length of the home before it reaches the open windows.

On the Mohammed point, I think you're right there. While games have used terrorists groups in the middle east as enemies before, none that I am aware of have actually criticized the religion itself. While I believe Islam should be allowed to be satirized like the other religions, it may be considered a poor time to do so. You know, with current events and all that jazz.

But I think I also read somewhere that the Far Cry team focus on locations of their games before anything else. If they DID choose this location of rural America before deciding on themes or bad guys, their current choice seems like the clearest logical conclusion.

"DisneyTravel","t5_2ygrb","We just visited Pandora this weekend for the opening. My opinion: if you can, see it at daytime and at night. It's two totally different experiences. No spoilers, but seeing only one or the other is only half the experience, and I can't say which is better. 

The rides never dropped below a 120 minute wait. That may be better by the time you get there, of course. 

Both rides are worth experiencing. I'd recommend the Na'Vi river ride first, followed by the Flight of Passage. The Flight Ride is amazing and may unfairly overshadow the river ride. If you only get to do one or the other, DO NOT MISS THE FLIGHT RIDE. The queue itself is outstanding, and the ride is unbelievable. 

**My overall Pandora suggestion**: show up before sundown, see the Pandora world in the daylight. Ride the river ride first, then the flight of passage. Grab a Mo'ara margarita and walk around while/after the sun sets and rediscover Pandora. Buuuut this kinda ruins your MK visit though. 


**Fast Pass tip:** just because you don't get the Fast Pass you want right away, don't give up; keep checking back and ""spamming"" for better ones. 

Get Fast Passes for something you'll be interested in, but go back in to modify them (like you're looking for a different time slot) and you'll sometimes nab a better ride. 

Top tier rides may suddenly pop up, or much earlier times may suddenly appear. My daughter scored Fast Passes for EPCOT's Frozen by trying to modify a Nemo Fast Pass for 8pm, and wound up with Frozen that opened up immediately. :)

Edited to add clarification above: 

&gt; The Flight Ride is amazing and may unfairly overshadow the river ride.

The main intent of the law is to protect you while performing routine maintenance outside of the dealership, so long as the parts used were made for OEM spec.  It was not written with intent to allow people to slap performance mods on their vehicles.  The way the law is written does allow you to modify systems on the car, voiding only that particular system in the process.

So if you reflashed your car and needed a wheel bearing and they told you no, then contact your lawyer.  If you reflashed it and need a turbo, you're more than likely out of luck.

Given he wasn't expelled, I'd say yeah, there was probably a lot of cheating.  Cheating seams like a waste of money for the student who learns nothing, but having them enrolled is profitable for the school, so they have little incentive to stop it unless it is so open it could harm the schools certification or be used in court to try and prove the education is worthless (which actually happened to the culinary arts department).",1496275213

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","can't speak to how deliberate that is or whether there's a consensus behind the scenes at DC regarding how to write damian, but in-universe it can be explained pretty easily.

first reason is that damian and dick (at least post-flashpoint) are probably closer to one another than any of the robins are. dick is almost certainly in an apples-to-oranges tie with bruce as the most important person in damian's life. how damian acts around a respected mentor/friend/brother figure to whom he served as a subordinate partner for a long time (doc m's time interference not withstanding) is going to be *way* different from how he acts around his peers, let alone peers he's in charge of... which leads me to point two.

second reason damian comes off like an ass around the teen titans compared to how we saw him with nightwing is that the power dynamics are drastically different. damian was dick's partner, and dick was largely responsible for molding damian into a tolerable human being, even raising him in a sense. damian's obviously going to be (slightly) more willing to be vulnerable or deferential to somebody like that... whereas [being a robin who leads the teen titans is probably exacerbating his royalty/legacy complex](https://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads//2010/11/t23.jpg)—even in nightwing we saw him outright refer to himself more than once as the [heir to mantle of the batman](http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/18299479_303585066742717_5987333888370802688_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTUwODkwMjM3NDA0MzIyNzQwMw%3D%3D.2)—and everything that made him insufferable when he first appeared is back, plus the experience of actually having been a hero for some time. this is a kid who had powers for all of a few days and was [dismissive of shazam and superman](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e7/9a/43/e79a43dc753a4f5db58ad30ab3e76a2d.jpg) *to their faces* when he guest starred on a justice league mission. damian's come a long way in the context of the bat family and his own solo adventures but even now he still barely plays well with others outside the immediate bat fam, most of whom are trained adults. in damian's head, he's equal in at least some ways to all of them but batman and sometimes dick. we have no reason to expect he'd be anything but his arrogant, emotionally closed-off self when it comes to dealing with a bunch of teenagers he introduced himself to by [capturing them](http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Teen-Titans-1-DC-Rebirth-spoilers-preview-6.jpg) without much effort.

"ITCareerQuestions","t5_30560","I've conducted interviews and helped make hiring decisions for sysadmin and help-desk positions. This is roughly how I would assign points to a candidate:  

&amp;nbsp;

+10 if you do well with the tech questions I give you during the interview.   
+10 for significant relevant work experience  
+7 for a degree in CS from a decent, accredited university  
+6 for a degree in Engineering or other STEM field  
+2-4 for certs appropriate for the position.  
+2 for a non-STEM degree from an in-person university  
+0 for a non-STEM degree from an online university  
-1,000 for a GED instead of a high school diploma, UNLESS you have a degree from an in-person university or several years work experience at the same place.

&amp;nbsp;

If I am hiring someone, I have two main concerns - do they have the technical ability to do the work, and can they show up every day, follow instructions, and not be crazy. A high school diploma, work experience, or a degree from an in-person university all tell me you can show up, sit in one place, and follow instructions. A GED pretty much tells me you can't. An online degree isn't much evidence one way or the other, so unless it's in STEM I would ignore it.

&amp;nbsp;

If you go the regular college route, I wouldn't go straight to a 4-year private school. Go to a community college for 2 years then transfer somewhere cheap and decent. If you get good grades you can probably transfer somewhere decent even with a bad high school transcript.",1496275217

EQ the group, which is sending to main LR, using a graphic EQ, which is built into the group on the QU. On top of EQing the group with similar mics, I also apply GEQs to each output and EQ those as well.

Where I work, ringing the mic out is used more as a saying, since a mic is going to be the only input that rings. So saying ringing out a mic doesn't necessarily mean the channel level EQ.",1496275218

I'm not afraid of a neo-nazi stabbing a brown or black person in a crowd. Or a KKK shooting a black person in a crowd. Because they mostly target single people, not crowds.

"TrollYChromosome","t5_2tvh2","A similar thing happened to me 2 years ago when I went through grief and horror at the violent loss of a friend of mine who went on vacation and never came back. The PTSD and grief were something my friends decided they didn't want to deal with. I don't know what to tell you, because I don't know your friends, and because since all of the stuff happened to my friend (and me, by association) and the loss of all of those friends, I really have no desire to go out or be around people anymore. What I will say is that I am learning to be happy without them. My friend, just a couple of months before she disappeared, wrote to another friend and said, essentially, that you need to decide how you want to feel about yourself and your life, and then make choices that get you there. Most things fade away or become scars, and you can move on from it in time. The best thing I can say is that they're not really your brothers if they're not around during the hard times. For whatever reason, if they really have decided to disassociate with you, you need to realize that they're the kind of people who have chosen to or are incapable of sticking by your side. So fuck them. Figure out how to make yourself happy in your own life for a little while as you rebuild your inner circle. If it's just one or two friends, they might also be going through something hard that they don't want to talk about or of which you're unaware. Ask after them, see if they're okay, and if they don't respond, you've exerted and exhausted the leverage you have in the situation, and can peacefully move on. Best wishes, OP.

The above is just an outline, not a complete argument.

I should mention, there are many equivalent ways of defining the real numbers, including axiomatic ones which take the supremum property as an axiom, but then you have to show even the existence of decimal expansions.

Your problem is that your husband with all his issues is likely to push back a lot harder than some because he is probably incapable of looking at what is being said to him, to second guess or anticipate it and to react in a sophisticated, thoughtful, strategic or diplomatic way. Having said that a lot of people fail to do that and they have not been diagnosed with ADHD. He simply doesn't have the emotional maturity to meet you at your level and given the ADHD he may never develop it, even late on.

The whole thing is obviously getting to you in a big way (that's not a criticism, just an observation), and it's maybe leaking out beyond the immediate interaction between you and him. It would be hardly surprising if it was. Apart from the therapy you are going to, do you have any other outlets or coping strategies for dealing with this? For example, would meditation, yoga, mindfulness, tai chi be of any help to you? Exercise is recommended a lot, so going to the gym is a good thing.

If you were not in the exact place at the exact time to see the chicken for example, it wouldn't have felt so synchronistic. So, that begs the question...

When did the synchronicity start?

When you woke up that morning? When you cracked the first egg for your omlette? If you didn't leave at the exact time you did that day it could have changed the entire course of events for the day.

Or did the synchronicity begin at birth? If you weren't born at the exact time and place you were born, you never would have had the egg n chicken day.

Or maybe it began at the beginning of time... the point is, every moment could technically be considered a synchronicity... because nothing is more synchronistic than our planet orbiting the sun in the perfect position to foster our civilization from microbes to the point we have advanced to today.",1496275223

I've been very fortunate to find some great people to play with who don't care about gender and just want to play.  Heck, my favorite discord is about half and half for gender.  

I will admit we don't play MOBAs or MMOs and the community I play with grew out of the necessity to find *some way* to communicate during Splatoon ranked matches.  It's also had a significant amount of pruning and bans to curtail harassment.  


My friends I used to play league with were all girls or trusted IRL friends so maybe poke around on here for a group to play with if a game you enjoy lets you build your own teams and isn't just random matchups.  

I do tend to speak with a lower voice (hallelujah for being an alto) when playing online games with people I don't know and often get asked if I'm a guy or a girl.  Whenever people ask I just say ""well what do *you* think?"" and that tends to either lead to hilarious tangents or shut people up.  Another great thing to say is ""I'm a veloceraptor.

Training on many specific types of mobs will yield good xp/charms and gp/h, usually you won't spend any money on training magic and it'll always be above 300k xp/h (in some places 2M+ xp/h)

Abyss is packed with people who don't know about other methods but it's certainly nowhere near good. The only redeeming quality of this place is that it's afk, very afk.

From YBT, i can safely assume that they would get at least ryu and possibly tobi as well. However, i also sense that he feels reluctant to put more LH players in the team even though miro is an amazing player.

My guess is that we might see manno + flex tank at tanker positions since manno is insane on both rein and winston like miro. For flex, it would be either zunba or hoon or libero depending on the need of dps / dva player. (Personally i think its safe to pick zunba)

For dps... i think we might see duo from a team like healers. If flow3r is healthy, flow3r-pine might b decent but kdp dps duo is insane as well. I dont think they want to pick dps from different teams to bring as much synergy as possible.

I noticed that you mentioned **`yaourt`**. This tool is generally not
recommended for use. It is insecure due to sourcing PKGBUILDs before
the user has a chance to read them.

Consider using a [different AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers#Comparison_table).
**`pacaur`** is generally considered a good alternative.
It has very similar usage and syntax, allowing easy switching.
[Here is a link to its AUR page.](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pacaur/)
In addition to being vastly more secure, it has a friendlier interface.
It asks for package confirmations at the beginning of the installation
process, allowing unattended installation.

Thanks for using Arch Linux!

In English:

&gt;at Sinuessa a child was born of uncertain sex, as between male and female —the populace call them hermaphrodites^1, as it uses many similar terms, since the Greek language is more apt in compounding words.

1. Obviously, the text has ""androgynos"" instead of some form of hermaphrodite. Bad choice on the translator's part.

For example, if I'm in a car accident and kill someone, i could be responsible for the pain I've caused that person and that person's family. But if I was following the law and THEY ran the red light, no one is going to throw me into prison. I won't be held accountable for something that is beyond my control.

That can also be applied here. OP's BF gave what he thought was a compliment. It hurt her. She ""brought it up to him,"" and he ""doesn't seem to understand what [she's] saying."" Who's fault is that? Clearly they need to communicate more.

All of you are throwing this guy under the bus when you're heard only one side of the story. If he is generalizing all women and thinks they're uptight, controlling, whatever, obviously that is bad. 

(I'm not saying you're doing this personally--) But you don't have to go on a witch hunt to fix such an easy problem. I think OP is overreacting if she's brought this up ONCE and is considering breaking up with him, given the fact that he doesn't understand where she's coming from.

I just want enough to replace it with something comperable.

&gt;If you want to dispute it, ask about taking it before an independent appraiser. Look for comparable vehicles in your area and get their price. Submit them to the insurance company for review. 

     I plan on finding as many comparable vehicles as possible to submit to them.

The sad truth is that you just have to find people who don't play combo, and not play with those who do. 

Alternatively, what I do at my LGS, (where none of us play combo because we want to play games where the goal is for everyone to have fun, not just one player) is that the table all  says to the person who combo-ed off to win, ""Congrats, you win, we're all going to keep playing for second place."" This is especially effective against the non-interactive combo decks that don't do anything until they try to win.

&gt; ***** UPDATE *****
The funeral home has cleared our balance as a way of making reparations.  My MIL has access to her bank account and Revenue Canada reinstated her pension and will be sending her documentation proving that she is a legal ""living"" person.

&gt; Thank you everyone for your helpful comments - I really appreciate it!

&gt; **********************************************************

&gt; To cut a long story short, the funeral home made several mistakes during the funeral and visitations.  I was able to get a discount off the funeral of approximately $1700 after speaking with management because of all of the problems.  I thought that we were finished with said issues but now the funeral home has filed my mother in law as deceased and Revenue Canada is sending letters to ""The Estate of roxy_monoxide's Mother in Law"".  

&gt; The bank has now frozen her assets and accounts and there is going to be a lot of red tape to have her declared ""living"".  My question is, do we have any legal recourse here?  We live in Ontario, Canada.  Also, if this is the wrong subreddit, please let me know where this would be best suited.

Instead of fixing the core problem with the Codex (from 2012 i believe) they just kept releasing a FULL PRICE SUPPLEMENT every year that only gave one sub faction some special flavor. Red Corsairs, Crimson Slaughter, Black Legion, Thousand Sons, some generic book of formations, then early this year we got Traitor Legions which was the saving grace for the army and allowed us to finally play Chaos as Chaos instead of Spiky Marines.

And then it all got scrapped.

And not to talk down or anything but Black Templars are just one fairly flavorful chapter. They deserve their own book for sure but imagine if every Loyal Marine chapter got squeezed into a single book. No SW, BA, or DA books, just one normal sized Codex Space Marines with some painting guides. That's what Chaos has been suffering with for several editions now.",1496275234

As far as I can tell, the only addition over awakening are friendships A+ and the little treehouse in the castle. That's it. Both of which are easily ignored (in 3 playthroughs I haven't even gotten a single friendship A+). Heck, the castle also added the arena, the lottery, a useless hotspring, accessories and so on. Why fixate on the treehouse?

I'd even say there are LESS overall relations in a playthrough, since relationships are spread out on both sides (you need multiple playthroughs to get different characters) and many characters have no interaction with others (made more evident in the Revelations playthrough). Also, brothers and sisters can't marry.

"infertility","t5_2saej","Ugh is right. Fucking cysts. There has never been any suggestion that I have PCOS but apparently I do have a super fun (/s) ongoing cyst problem. It's interesting you mention the pain/feeling like you had to urinate. About 2 years ago I had this ""episode"" where I felt like I had to pee ALL THE TIME. I kept getting checked for UTIs and yeast infections but everything seemed okay. I even got checked for STDs even though I had no idea how I could possibly have one. No one ever checked for a cyst. When I got pregnant and miscarried, the issue seemed to resolve itself for awhile. But I had occasionally had that feeling again since then. Last summer I went to my OB (1) because we had been trying for a year with no success and (2) because I had ongoing pain in my right side. The OB did an ultrasound, said she saw a small cyst but not to worry about it, and sent me off the the RE. By the time I got to the RE, there was no sign of a cyst (until a new one showed up a couple months later). It just makes me wonder how long this has been going on and whether some kind of magical fucking cyst problem is why nothing ever works for me. 

It's just hard to gear for IUIs then get them cancelled time after time. We pay for the stupid ultrasounds. My husband wrangles his work schedules which involves a lot of traveling to make sure he will be in town for the surge window. I get myself mentally prepared to not have alcohol or coffee and to tolerate the letrozole induced mood swings. And then it's all for nothing. I also feel like I shouldn't ""waste"" my no cyst cycles on IUIs that are really not likely to work if I could do IVF instead. I don't know. You get it. It just plain sucks. ",1496275236

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Yea no. It's not a wrong opinion. GTA5 does literally nothing. It has jack shit. They omitted literally every good feature from SA and if that weren't bad enough, the core GTA gameplay is boring as fuck in 5. It brings *nothing* to the table. It did nothing special. Each GTA generally added something unique or cool. SA had the gang focus as well as car pimping, planes, RPG elements, schools to level your driving and flying skills, eating food for health and hunger stats, multiple learnable melee styles, minigames like beach dancing stupidity, dating, etc.

The only thing GTA5 preserved from that was the flight school, which was stupid anyway. Sure, you can still do vigilante missions or drive a firetruck etc. But GTA5 failed every single category of being a good GTA. The driving is boring, the wrecks are boring, doing tricks is boring, the soundtrack is the worst since GTA3, vehicle customization is less robust than SA was, the city itself is boring, the satire is boring, Lazlow is extremely boring and not funny, it's just silly. And GTA online, kek.

"peloton","t5_2suzs","Last minute entry, taking advantage of an entire city being a world Heritage, plus taking in the sites and sounds of Somerset and Wiltshire.

We start off in the World Heritage city of Bath, climbing out and heading towards the local town of Radstock, before moving onto the Cathedral City of Wells. We then approach the famous town of Cheddar, before climbing Cheddar Gorge, which is a fairly long and winding test in the gorge.

Then it's off to the seaside at Clevedon, via a fast descent to Burrington. After taking in the sights and sounds we head to Bristol, crossing the famous Clifton suspension bridge before going north-east out of the city. 35km later we enter the Cotswolds, with the hard climb out of Wotton-Under-Edge featuring. 

After that, a reasonable descent follows to Chippenham, where the race truly hots up. There's a long drag out of the city, before climbing up onto the windswept Colerne and then descending into Bath via Bannerdown. We fly past the start finish straight before tackling Bathwick Lane, 1.9km at 7.7%, peaking at 12%. It's then a ride past the Uni before dropping down to Midford, and then down a narrow lane over a small climb, before heading back onto the bigger roads by Monkton Combe.

The final two climbs of the race are serious. The first is Brassknocker, 1.1km at 11%, with gradients in excess of 20% on the climb. We then drop down Bathwick lane once more, turning left and assaulting the last climb of the day, Ralph Allen Drive. This one is 1.2km at a constant 9.8%, and is followed by a little false flat past the university once more, before dropping down Bathwick Lane for the final time. 

The finish is a flat wide road in the heart of Bath, with the turn onto it coming 50m after the descent finishes. The course is 228km with 2700m of climbing.

I am in medical school. Tuition ranges around 80K/year-100K/year. I worked for 7 years after college trying to save whatever I could, and when I matriculated, I put every single dollar I had towards my first semester, and came up short. Student loan rates thereafter were provided to me, and by far the best rates were those offered by the government (6-7% vs. 11%+ in the private market).

There is no feasible way short of starting a very successful company in your early 20s, for any level of personal responsibility to overcome the immense and crushing expenses of medical school; you can blame all of the ""market"" factors and government interference, sure, but it doesn't remove the reality that if you want a medical education in this country, you are required to get a loan, or to have access to an incredibly large sum of money.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Normally I'm all for the 529 route, but with such a short time horizon and in what is likely a low income bracket (look at the OP's handle), I'd hazard that he or she isn't going to get a lot of tax-preferred savings, much less have time for it to take advantage of compounding benefits.

Instead, if you have earned income, you should put it into a Roth IRA. Unlike a 529 Plan, you can always take out the principal tax-free. You'll have a wider range of investments available to you, and you can hold onto any money you don't use until you retire. The downsides of a Roth, the cap on earnings and annual contributions, I'm guessing won't apply to you assuming you're in a low tax bracket and have minimal earnings.

All that said, you should still check your home state's 529 plan to see if there are any state-specific benefits, like matching grants, scholarships, etc. [Washington college has a match for attendees using 529 savings to pay their tuition](http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/washington-college-to-award-scholarship-match-to-529-plan-contributions-965), which is a very sweet deal.

Mudras will always be 20sec CD (ignoring big cooldowns) and sometimes longer depending on how quickly the player can make use of them.

While I agree, I don't factor NIN's damage trait in to their overall damage as I would buffs that require upkeep. I think of it more like NIN's damage is at its balance with the trait, and not '20% higher than other classes' because it has it. It's like how poison's work currently: they're balanced *around* it. It's not like NINs are at 120% with their poisons on, it's more like they'd be at 80% with their poisons *off*. If that makes sense.

But if the devs have balanced things properly, SAM *will* be the highest damage simply by virtue of bringing no raid utility, though that remains to be seen - and by how much higher they are, if at all. MNKs look a bit *better* than they do currently imo, though I'm glad they weren't changed too much because I quite like how they play currently.",1496275244

"forhonor","t5_38p4n","Frankly Ubisoft, this is unacceptable. Myself and quite a few other players at the highest level of play have seen these patch notes and decided to leave for Absolver. This game is amazing and we all love it, and stuck it out hoping to see the changes it so desperately needs. We are fine with minimal updates, but this is LITERALLY you spitting in our faces. 

First you release a statement about a glitch caused by your end stating that you will ban those using the warden glitch ""because you don't work on weekends."" Then, 2 weeks after season 2 release (which has just been unhealthy overall for the game with the lack of a defensive overhaul) you release patch notes essentially doing nothing. Meanwhile those at the highest tier of play can no longer just sit back thinking everything will eventually be fine, and that you are going to fix the game. Enough is enough. This is the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of us. 

I really wish you guys could have been as dedicated to this game as some of your players have. At this rate you should have just released the defensive picks, but instead you decided to give us 0 reworks to kits, or balance tweaks other than centurion wall pin infinite combo being removed?

The terrible time it takes to get a nuclear plant online makes it far less viable in the near term. That is why Elon's solar roofs are a far better option.

Because I was explicitly, and specifically, talking about mid to high tier managerial talent with a focus within Public Sector IT. You must have missed that. Obviously.

And that talent is clearly lacking in sufficient quantities to supply the public administration with a completely filled and competent Org Chart. And that is not an attack by me. Despite you so desperately wanting it to be one. It is reality. 

It would be totally unreasonable for a country to expect a population percentage in the mid-20s(I am referring to French as primary language citizens here) to provide from within its community the vast majority of the Public Sector's mid to high tier talent in a niche field. But that is basically how the system has designed itself over the last 40 years. And we have to deal with it. And we are free to point out the problems with that. And if you take offence to people pointing out the obvious problems there, well. S'okay. 

But whatever. Take me out of context and interpret everything as a personal attack. That is okay. Kinda another win for me tbh. I love to shitpost.",1496275248

You start with ""Put one of your business cards,"" and then use the phrase ""or a piece of paper with an alternate number.""  That makes no sense.  A business card IS a piece of paper with an alternate phone number.  You don't say ""cat or pet"" because a cat is a pet.  The way you wrote the sentence excludes phone numbers from the piece of paper.

Plus, ""or a piece of paper with an alternate number"" is not an intervening clause.  Again, bad grammar. 

The proper grammar would be to use the word ""another."" You should have written ""LPT: Put one of your business cards or another piece of paper with an alternate phone number . . . .""

But now Evangelicals are super popular and they spreading fast, just like a virus and, as a result, Catholics are becoming more religious and crazy because now they have competition.

I know catholics who believe in intelligent design, which is something they didn't used to believe a decade ago and it's something the cacholic church also doesn't believe. But now Brazilian catholics believe in that BS because, I guess, that's they gotta do that if they want to stay relevant.

As the result, the whole country is becoming more right-wing and we're starting to see politians who are anti-gays, anti-abortion, anti-weed, anti-green energy and anti-everything being open about it because they know the people will now agree with them. It's pretty sad.

Mix BM meta again with the current berserker savage hit leech and everyone will definitely be playing berserker with no further changes in 3.0 and ignore increased mana multipliers.

But instead of me speculating on hypothetical balance issues, let's go back to your point. Agreed on most of it. It's sad that we have Mana Flasks as a noob trap because mana leech and/or a little regen completely invalidate it. Even unique mana flasks are ignored or are annoying to use because of how short the effect lasts when your mana hits full.

To me it always comes back to the extra damage they've given us and the monster HP they've jacked up to try to balance it out (and failed). Turns out that throwing More Damage multipliers on a ton of support gems and allowing skills to be cast endlessly while having infinite uptime on movement flasks allows for some crazy shit.

A Financial Ombudsman reference can cost a firm £550 per case, so that is an incentive for both Lowells and Callcredit (CRAs are also regulated by the FCA) to find your account even if it means someone trawling through paper records.

&gt; I applied for a loan (£5,00 with a view to buying a motorcycle). That was refused, which is why I checked the credit reference which is where this started.

If you can quantify some damage that refusal has caused (e.g., if you were to get alternative finance at a higher rate, or missed opportunity - this is not a contractual breach, but a breach of a duty of care) then that mentioning that, along with Durkin v DSG Retail Limited establishing the duty of care that Lowells has in intimating the correct information to Callcredit may motivate them to treat your case with more urgency.",1496275252

Hey there, your submission was removed from /r/listentothis because your account does not yet meet our minimum karma requirements to post links. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just listen and enjoy the music. Please read this entire reply because we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and [the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq). Next, read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn how the sub operates. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment but not submit music to listentothis. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely. New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit music links in listentothis. We can't divulge this score, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you are planning to submit your own music or the music of someone with whom you have a personal association** (e.g. friend, neighbor, colleague, etc.), you may do so [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week) after your account is at least one day old. Additionally, we recommend reading the [guidelines for self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as violating these rules can result in a site-wide shadowban - that's simply the way reddit operates and is outside of our control. 

**If you wish to advertise your music in listentothis**, you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* without the need to earn upvotes. 

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician**, listentothis is not the place for your first musical creations. This sub is for *finished* tracks, and even then, you may post [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). There are plenty of other music communities that will give you feedback and advice on how to improve your sound. Some of the most well-known communities are listed below.

* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback

* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources - they *will* help you improve.

Happy listening and good luck!

Who hires people? Who puts the money back into companies? Who invests? You're arguing a chicken and egg situation, where in fact the final decision on whether a job should be created falls on the people who actually own the capital, and therefore taxing those who own the capital to the point where they cannot afford to hire workers is harmful to the economy. 

""Demand"" is something the rich take advantage of by investing money and creating businesses. Obviously they need to hire workers to meet the demand, so they'll hire workers, but those jobs aren't magically created by the existence of demand for a product; they are created by a business owner or shareholder deciding it is economically feasible and beneficial to the company to hire.",1496275253

There are a few different kayak/canoe rental businesses up there, I prefer to go through Buckley's (on M-20, W of town by Deerfield park). They have multiple trips that are all really enjoyable. This is a great activity for dates! 


If you're into biking, Mt. Pleasant is a really bike-able town. The park system (Island Park, Millpond Park, Nelson Park) has a fun paved path that connects a lot of them together. 
You could also bike a portion of the [Pere Marquette Rail Trail](https://www.traillink.com/trail/pere-marquette-rail-trail/)


I also found the ice rink, CMU sporting events and the downtown restaurants/bars to be suitable dating activities as well.

TP has better combat but doesn't have that many tough enemies until quite late in the game, which is disappointing. The back slash technique is a bit OP and boring, but I do like that against some of the tougher enemies you really have to work to hit them.

OoT (and Master Quest) has Stalfos, which are great. You can really dodge their swipes to get a hit in. Their shield is a tangible object - if you hit it, they block, but if you can come in on an angle where their shield isn't covering, they take damage. I actually really like sword combat in OoT.

I will try to make more interesting encounters requiring thinking like bosses killable by solving a puzzle or finding a weak spot. Maybe if I describe environments in more detail the players will use it to their advantage. 

As you say combat is generally slow which brings me to another problem. Combat is relatively complicated, but trying to bullshit a guard is mostly one roll and the whole encounter is solved. I guess negotiation will have to be slower and more focused on roleplaying than dice. Like not letting the player change everyone's minds after one deception roll, but slowly working through opponent's doubts to make him believe the player.

I just feel like being unfair when I tell that one player his solution can't possibly work because of how the world works.

The European members (with some exception) have been underfunding their NATO contribution goals since at least the fall of the Iron Curtain. With Germany being the biggest offender. The latest 2% pledge was just yet another lame attempt at getting things back on track.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When my mom got a new job just before my senior year of high school, we had to move very quickly as it was a hour long commute or more and I was going to have to switch schools now. Whatever, but we ended up finding a place that looked nice, the show apartment was nice, and they had on-site laundry. Seemed good, but the rent was a bit steep. Whatever, we're desperate.

When we move in, after we signed the paperwork which was red flag #1, we noticed many, many issues. One of the slats were broken off of the blinds in one of the bedrooms, the vents had all sorts of things jammed in them, and were filled with dust, there was a scorch mark on one of the counters, the hood above the stove was covered in warped and bubbling paint, amongst many, many other things. But whatever, we're already locked into a lease, we can't just break it and find a place in the limitted time we had before the school year started, and get the paperwork done for another school.

So, that's whatever. The first month goes by, they half-ass fixing the handful of things we asked to be fixed, red flag #2, so we stopped asking. Then, they decide they can't take being paid on the 15th when my mom got paid, so red flag 3, they said it was easier to put an eviction notice in the door every single month. Mind you, there were like 20 buildings with 3 floors and 2 to 4 apartments per floor, so if this happens with even just a small percentage of renters, that's a huge waste of paper.

Then, they decide instead of installing a peephole like we asked, red flag number whatever, they're just gonna swap the front doors from our apartment and the one next to it. They forget to give us two keys, so I have to wait to get into the office on one of the days that they're open later since they closed right around when school let out. If the bus was late getting to my complex, they'd already be locked up. That was extra fun since the only way to reload your laundry card was inside the office, and they never had change but the machine only took 1's, 5's and 10's.

One day someone flushed a tie or something and a different person ran their dishwasher and it flooded my kitchen with sewage. They just left some hispanic dude, alone, in my apartment who spoke almost no English, to clean it. They did not attempt to call, text, email, leave a note or otherwise inform us that it had happened, that they would have someone clean it, or anything like that. They promised they'd take the cost of the items that needed to be thrown away, several loaves of bread, cereal boxes, tupperware, utensils, and other things that got soaked in the nasty fluids off of the next months rent, but surprise surprise, they didn't.

The last straw, excluding things that I have since forgotten or don't want to include like racism or things not directly the fault of the landlords, was when they used pre-existing damage to say we would not get our deposit back. So, while we were moving out, since the first floor was down stairs, we decided to open up the living room window and use that to push things that were unwieldy out, rather than try to carry them up the narrow stairs. We just left the screen sitting next to the window, which we shut and locked, when we left.",1496275259

The problem with capitalism to communism, though, is that while capitalism undermines feudalism, communism does not undermine capitalism. Communist behavior can exist within the confines of a capitalist system. However, capitalist behavior undermines communism.

The 10:1 rule says that, basically, for every 1 promotional submission you submit to the subreddit, you should have 10 non-promotional submissions. These submissions can be either posts or comments. Promotion can be self promotion or the promotion of others.

As a general rule, take promotional content to include:

- Links to community websites (self or non-self involving)

- Links (or references) to streams or YouTube channels (again, self or non-self involving)

- Links to written articles (self or non-self involving)

- Links to artwork (I think you get the point by now)

- Feedback on content (and comments contain in such threads)

- Links to your own websites/emails/contact addresses

If what you're submitting doesn't fall under any of those categories, it doesn't count as promotional content. You can submit as much non-promotional content as you want!

As a general warning, the first post on a new account should not be promotional.

Be aware that this is a rule that is enforced by the reddit admins and not following it might get you banned site-wide.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","You easily get 100 AP on singed in a decent amount of time, the E is also way cheaper early on. You start with ~30 AP on singed and so you get 6.6% max HP dmg early on already up from 6. Around lvl 10 (rank 3 E) you will likely fall a bit behind because you won't get anymore AP till around lvl 13 (rylais).

The Q change is also a huge buff as it seems. You need just 75 AP to go even later on and early on it is even a slight base dmg buff. So 7 more dmg per second at lvl 1 (30 AP).

The R change is the only nerf and that only at rank 1. The rank 2 ult has +10 stats, -50 mana costs and the double Q duration but loses 5 sec total duration, which is a fair trade. At rank 3 the new ult is even stronger. This will give him some trouble early game but all the stats he lose at rank 1 should easily be made up for by the Q and E buffs (lower mana costs, higher dmg) and in a lot of cases a 15 sec of extra stats are more than enough, you only need the other 10 sec that early for the mana and HP reg and with the lower costs you won't need the mana reg anyways. So you lose some HP reg and some stats during the ult.",1496275262

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It does if you don't ever give up. Don't become a spectator. Don't let life happen to you. If you fall down seven times, get up eight. 

I was born into a poor family. My mother was in prison. My aunt who raised me battled with depression and drug abuse. I didn't do well in school because I didn't care. At 18, my life seemed fucked. I had barely graduated high school and though I did marginally better than average in my SATs I could only get into a shitty community college though with no financial aid. I still lived at home with my aunt who now had an abusive live in boyfriend. At 19, my aunt in a fight with her boyfriend burned out house down. 

I was stuck working at starbucks and realized that I needed to get a college degree if I expected to do anything with my life. But I couldn't afford college because I had to help support my family. But I never thought for a second that I would never go to college. I just thought of the situation as temporary, and that eventually, I'd find a way. I sometimes took a class to work towards that end. 

Because I never gave up, little by little, opportunities started opening up. Eventually, at 27 I was able to go to school full time. I ended up getting two degrees. I then went to a good law school with a great scholarship. I got two law degrees. A JD and an LL.M. 

I'm glossing over a lot of course. But looking back at everything I was able to do it because I just never gave up. If all I could do was take one class a year, I did it. if I couldn't take a class this year, then I made it a goal to take classes next year. I focused on just taking the next possible step. 

Everything is temporary. Riches will disappear with enough foolishness. Poverty will be alleviated with enough consistent hard work and financial wisdom. Your life is your life based on the accumulation of choices you make. Make good choices. ",1496275265

I wasn't saying they couldn't be feral (i've absolutely dealt with totally untamable feral cats, and if the kittens get no human interaction during their first 8-10 weeks they will almost never be ""pet"" material).  What I was saying is that cats are not *native* wild animals, they are invasive.  The should never be allowed to have feral ""colonies"" or be left to their own devices.  Feral cats are hugely destructive to native wildlife.

My last peragraph was in general and not directed to you at all, sorry if it came across that way.  I was just venting about people who adopt a cat and then toss it in the back yard the first time it does something ""annoying"" inside and then they try and justify it in some way other then them just being too lazy to put in the effort to correct the issue(s) (and sometimes it can be significant effort).

Some states actually allow hunting of feral cats it's become such a big issue.  Personally I'm fine with that even though I could never do it myself (even if I was 100% sure it was feral and not some persons escaped pet I would see *my* cats or *my* fosters through the scope and could never pull the trigger).  

Obviously the *real* fix is for people to not dump their cats when they become inconvenient and to *always* have them fixed.  Apparently cats and rabbits are some of the only mammals capable of having multiple litters per year.  It's crazy how fast they can multiply!",1496275267

Frankly, it sounds like your friends are being a little nitpicky (and not necessarily in a helpful way), which is why I was thinking that maybe they're just not people who usually read the kind of worldbuild-y fiction you're writing. As far as I'm concerned, ""I pray the Oche take pity on you"" tells the reader as much as they need to know about the Oche at any point I can imagine such a sentence being said. Does it make me curious about the Oche? Absolutely, and that's part of what's going to keep me interested, waiting until I find out wtf the Oche are. As for things like hillwalker, I don't immediately know what that is but still conveys some impressions, and I suspect context would make it pretty obvious as well. I don't know how often you're throwing these terms out vs defining them, but I wouldn't worry too much about how many you have overall.

The guns all handle incredibly differently, the only exception is that everything is a 1 shot headshot. Plenty of guns have recoil and need lots of experience to be good with them. There are definitely some guns that are lasers and are very beginner friendly, but they are off set by having low damage or ROF.

Map knowledge comes with time and by playing terrorist hunt. Every time a new map drops I play it in terrorist hunt solo about 10 times before jumping back into match making in case it pops up.

There is match making in casual but it is based off rank, so yes you do have to wait until level 20, play 10 games, then get your rank. Ranks were just reset last week so even a lot of high level players haven't gotten their ranks yet (like me,I haven't had the time/focus to dedicate to ranked in the past week) so I get thrown in with a mixed bag in casual. Now there are smurfs as well as experienced players who never play ranked so they will remain a problem, but they are definitely in the minority.",1496275267

- Is it better to start by learning how to play an Acoustic Guitar before an Electric one? Having no experience with either instrument, I assume that the electric guitar will have a steeper learning curve because of amplifiers, but is it going to be a major hinderance?

- What is a good guitar to purchase? I don't own any right now, and have been looking at a few on Amazon.

As you get better you can track enemys and predict their movement so you can set yourself up for trades. That also takes time. For now, stay in a group and keep your head down. Most people lose a ton of armor early being impatient. Never trade with a sniper if you are at a weapon/range disadvantage. Keep your head down for a few until people start brawling or full attacking. 

Also, if you do use the LLas/sniper builds, you do need to stay with your team to some extent. Just because you are doing chip damage at 1400 meters doesn't mean you are helping your team. Stay at range, but be close enough to help your team. As with everything else, it comes from minimap awareness and time.",1496275269

"creepy","t5_2raed","&gt; Nurse Joy pondered for a few moments which was the best choice to use on her gorgeous new toy. After all, they didn't come along too often. She decided on one of her favourites, a bright pink (of course) ring gag. It was made up of two parts - the first, a metal ring on a leather strap that was fastened tightly around the captive's head. This forced the ring between the captive's upper and lower jaw, ensuring that they couldn't close their mouth. The ring had a soft rubber ring around its outside which is the part that actually made contact with the teeth, and had a screw thread on its inside. This let the second part of the gag, which was a thick rubber plug like that used in a sink, be screwed in to keep the captive silent.
&gt; Aside from just being extremely humiliating, which Joy enjoyed the thought of Serena being very much, it also let her have access to the pretty trainer's mouth when she wanted it, and silence when she didn't. Perfect, thought Joy, as she set about slowly opening her captive's mouth wide enough for the gag. She placed her thumb on Serena's chin and pulled down slowly, opening her mouth wider and wider. She began to stir a little, and Joy knew she was nearly out of time.
&gt; A little quicker than she had planned, Joy opened her toy's mouth as wide as she could pull it without waking her up for sure. She brought the ring gag up to Serena's lips, and angled it in to the top of her mouth first. She could feel the helpless blonde stir underneath her, so she quickly forced the bottom of the gag inside her mouth as well. This prompted a quiet moan, but Joy knew she was nearly done. She slid the strap under Serena's golden hair and clasped it tightly shut around the back of her head.
&gt; Joy brought the plug up in front of Serena's lips, and was bringing it steadily towards the bound trainer when to her surprise, Serena's eyes scrunched up a little, and her brow furrowed. Joy paused for a moment and bit her tongue. After what seemed like minutes, the blonde drifted back off into a motionless sleep, much to Joy's relief. Not that there was really much she could do at this point, thought the desperately horny nurse, but still. She slowly and carefully screwed the thick rubber plug into the ring, sealing her captive's mouth. When it was fully screwed in, the pattern on the outside of the plug matched that of the Pokeball on the outside of the building.
&gt; Serena was half naked, completely bound, gagged and helpless, and was sure to wake up any moment.
&gt; And Nurse Joy couldn't wait.

On NA PC, EP has been especially ruthless this campaign, pushing into enemy home keeps / scrolls, and just recently took everything before maintenance because the pts keep ticking.

Telescopic lens generally fine. The issue is when you have to go out of the way to be able to see, such as get a ladder to stand on it and peer over a fence to film a naked person in their back yard behind a 7 foot fence. That is peeping tom. However, to hold you hand up with a camera to film over it is not. There could be a 7 foot 6 person do that and he would not be a peeping tom so putting your camera over a fence isn't ""going out of way"". Back to police, film away.

The animation and movement is so smooth. I don't feel too floaty and not too heavy. Plus you don't lose momentum as fast, making it feel like you could just kill dozens of enemies without having to stop so many times. Also the design and layout of each level doesn't​ feel too repetitive either.

"MLPCCG","t5_2y3vv","Well then I actually do agree with RazgrinzInfinity on that point; although I don't necessarily know if it's anyone's fault. 

The way the game is right now, most of us who actively play (as far as I have seen), play at a fairly competitive level and use solid decks. Even the decks in the Silver Spanner ""Novice"" league demonstrated a fair amount of synergy and creative building that you don't see in true novice decks. I've tried to bring several new players into the game that were interested in playing casually, but they quickly lost interest when there were no other players at their level.   

The current group of players continues to get better, and the only new players that stay with the game are the ones skilled enough to compete. So how do you solve that problem? 

The solution that I would propose is mass adoption. A bunch of new players all joining at once. And the only way to get mass adoption is a marketing blitz. Plain and simple. **Advertising works.** Those of us that truly want to see this game thrive need to do all we can to promote it. The world needs to know it exists and is relevant. It's not enough for stores to host a pre-release, they need to have that release advertised with signs that all people entering into the store can see. When stores have calendars of their scheduled events, they need to have the meeting times of our local play groups. When play groups meet, have signs advertising what game it is people are playing. 

I realize I'm preaching to the choir for most of the people reading this, but reading so many negative opinions makes me feel that people should step up their game and come up with solutions instead of preaching helplessness. ",1496275276

He has pledged to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, make community college free, and opposes the construction of fossil fuel pipelines.*

&gt;*He is also tackling racism at the institutional level. The school-to-prison pipeline funnels children, disproportionately children of color, down a path devoid of the hope and opportunity that we must nurture within every child, in every school, and in every home. Tom wants to end this system that sees the state spend millions of dollars locking people up when we could provide real education opportunities instead at a lower cost. Additionally, his guarantee for paid family leave and affordable child care will give young families across Virginia the break they sorely need.”*

Followed up by /u/syeknom's interesting COTW on the issue from 3 years ago is still relevant.

&gt; At a certain point you have to divorce price from quality. A $1000 jumper is probably not going to be that much nicer fabric or stitching than a $400 one. Objectively this price is not ""worth"" this level of money in terms of what you get physically.

&gt; When considering dropping this kind of money on designer pieces it should be more motivated by the specific design of the piece, by the way the designer has used the materials to realise this design and how the piece fits in with your wardrobe and the designer's ""world"". If you just like the breton stripes and want a high quality jumper this one is not ""worth it"". If this *exact* jumper gives you lust, or if you saw it styled in a lookbook/shoot/runway and it gave you a dozen ideas for how to build outfits around it then, or if you are a huge fan of YSL (even these days) and have a strong relationship with the brand then it might be.

&gt; At the highest ends like this though you're paying a lot more than one ought to at retail due to the demographics involved (e.g. the people who will tell their shopping assistant to bring them a few jumpers to try on and then they pick the couple they like ignoring the price or the desiger/fabrics/). Whether to pay full retail for a designer piece or not is your call - for most I fear it's not a reasonable option but there are some where I'd happily pay full retail (Stephan Schneider, Dries Van Noten) but plenty more where I would only consider them on sale (e.g. Margiela).

&gt; The concept of ""worth it"" is a really bad angle to approach these things at in my opinion. Is paying £xx,xxxx for a painting ""worth it""? No one can really tell you a firm yes or no unless they're talking in terms of investment. Is paying £x,xxx for a designer chair ""worth it""? etc etc.

&gt; Spend time with the designer's work online, on the runway and in person and decide for yourself what you'd be happy to pay for their pieces. Don't just buy pieces because of the designer or because of the price though. It's a relationship between you, your money and the designer.

If it's arthritis you should get tx for that too. 

Compression is good; someone with lymphatic massage and PT skills can help fit you for a compression garment if you don't already have one. That will help the edema. I'd recommend a compression garment if you have lymphedema from physical damage/surgery/radiation. It won't go away but it can get significantly better.

"dotamasterrace","t5_2z18c","It's really a difference in philosophies I guess and as in all games it's subjective but totally based on your preferences. Dota's philosophy is to give you every tool you need to succeed. This means making an honest effort to have every Hero, Item and Strategy be a viable option for success. Dota's philosophy is to give you the tools and have you decide how you want to attain success and to never decide for you what will be succesful.

This means never enforcing arbitrary mechanics like lane swapping rules, balancing for lower skill levels or lack of voice communication. It also means a wider range of skill levels, strategies created, hero builds used hero diversity established. Basically they give you a box to play in some action figures to put in there and some toys to go with it. They never tell you how all of those things go together but let you decide what you want to do with it.

Now to me that is appealing. That is why I think it's the best game out there right now. It's why I never feel flatlined with the game and why I always learn something new. It's why I know I'm shit and it's why I know I want to get better. I can't speak much to the design or mechanics of other games but I know I don't feel the same with either of the two options you provided. To me those feelings are appealing in a game. ",1496275283

2. Have fun applying it

&gt; ""Good"" doesn't mean that there is no better weapon. It just means it's a decent weapon to use.

Good and Decent are 2 different things. You said all the weapons are good and now you say one of them are decent.

&gt; So not ""complete garbage,"" yes?

No but pretty close, so I'd still classify it as garbage.

&gt; Fun gun to use in PvE, especially if there's a solar burn.

&gt; Again a decent weapon. And I wouldn't want to waste my exotic on Outbreak Prime.

While school/education/career are important, it's also important to have a fulfilling life. Take advantage of adventure and opportunities (even if outside your comfort zone) whenever they arise, obviously don't hurt yourself or do anything too stupid, but taking spontaneous vacations/roadtrips or trying new hobbies is worthwhile and you'll learn more about yourself by doing things you weren't already in the habit of doing. 

Basically aim to be well-rounded in life. Get a career that can earn you a decent living, but don't commit 100% to your work, make time for leisure as well (even when you're young and middle-aged) and try to maintain that balance all throughout life.

As time goes on, more and more Canadians will be from families that made these sacrifices, and fewer will have had anything do do with the historical injustices.

I have nothing against people who want to priorities culture, tradition and family lands over economics.  But it seems impossible for everyone to have both.

Changing your political or religous beliefs generally requires some sort of self reflection and ability to admit you have been wrong. It's easier to do this to children as they are a blank slate essentially.



It's why it's so much easier to convince a 7 year old to be atheist than a 40 year old house mom that has has gone to Church twice a week for 25 years. The house mom would essentially have to admit that all her time devoted to God was all for naught. Pretty demoralizing. ",1496275291

It turns out it's over 300 times for a cotton bag, 27 times for a  recycled polypropylene and 7 for a paper bag.

Considering that most people reuse plastic grocery bags for other tasks (mine used to be small trashcan liners) this number only goes up.

My opponent lined his ships up across his board edge (I guess so they could close in around Han?), so I put Han where he could engage just one ship for the first round. While the other guy tried to engage Han, Poe came zooming as fast as he could from behind. 

The strengths of the list are than Han can throw 3-5 attack dice and 1-3 defense, and with both ships at PS 9, you can force the opening engagement to be on your terms. Its main weakness is that with only one reroll from Lone Wolf, Han won’t use Finn as much as Rey. There were also several times I *really* wished Han had engine upgrade.

The other list was Ahsoka, TLT Sabine w/ Chewbacca + hull upgrade, and regen Black One Snap. It ended in stalemate because I went after Ahsoka first, then Sabine, then Snap. In the end, it was Poe vs Snap, and Poe just couldn’t punch through the regen, while Snap just couldn’t catch a PS 9 boosting/barrel rolling ace.

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","Here is my success story!!
My husband (then boyfriend) went to counseling for the first time when we were dating for only a year and we had come to a complete impasse. I said ""everything wrong with our relationship is your fault."" He replied, ""everything wrong with our relationship is your fault."" We broke up but still lived together and He said let's go see someone. 

He just did some googling and found one. She has a certification I think, LFMT? Licensed family and marriage therapist maybe? He called and she said she took our insurance and set up a time. I wrote her an Email and said ""I don't like therapists and I don't really want you to tell us we have to stay together just because you want us to keep coming and paying you."" She called me in response and said if we need to break up, she will tell us that outright and help us leave it on good terms. 

We have seen her on and off for 8 years. She has helped us learn to talk to each other. We call her our translator- she speaks my husband's language and she speaks mine. She has seen us through engagement, marriage, pregnancy, and baby. She was one of the first people we told about all of that, actually and she was so happy she cried. We go now, even though she moved across the country and we meet via skype, just as a ""tune-up"" when we know there is something we can't solve OR preemptively. For example, we had a session when I was 8 months pregnant to talk through our fears about parenthood and what we expect as involvement from our families and expectations of each other. Our counselor, at this point, barely talks- but because she is there, we communicate better and more maturely than if we were alone. Counseling absolutely saved our relationship. 

Here's the thing- the reason a person wouldn't want to go to therapy is because they don't want to admit they might be doing something wrong or have some issues or be at fault for a problem in your relationship. Getting over your pride and being willing to work on yourself for the sake of your partner and your relationship means you have an INCREDIBLY STRONG relationship. My marriage is the most important thing to me and if I wasn't willing to hear uncomfortable truths about myself in order to save it, then I'm not really giving it my all. 

I wish you the best! ",1496275296

2) Fire is not sharp, true, but my point is that the bag can, as written, clearly be affected both by external as well as internal conditions, this means that damage from the inside is effectively treated the same as damage from the outside. So when does an item take damage? As you pointed out, situations where an item can take damage notably include the item being **unattended** (also note that this is an OR condition, this happens if the item is unattended OR specifically targetted OR the wielder rolls a nat 1, *either* one of those forces a saving throw to avoid damage). Attended in PF is actually pretty straightforward: If you carry/wield/wear an item, it's attended (or to generalize, if you touch it at any given moment), otherwise it's not, and the question specified throwing it into a campfire, so unless the owner throws himself onto the fire alongside the bag, it's unattended.

3) See above, as per the question, the bag is explicitly unattended.

Do note, if the question was ""What if I hold a bag of holding filled with black powder and set it alight"", the answer would be quite different (since that would be an attended object), but we are talking about an unattended object here.",1496275297

You should be able to get par of the ""everything full screen all the time"" with in a tiling wm, just with a workspace switcher on a quick keybroad shortcut.

Seriously? Science and policy just totally failed on everything? You haven't said what you believe they tried to do or what they failed to do; you also have no idea what the word ""evidence"" means (hint: it doesn't mean ""vague statement you pull out of your ass"").

&gt;Climate change smacks of population bomb-esque hype science complete with a fear-mongering book to rally everyone to the cause.

Okay, you're basically saying that the notion of the climate changing just *feels* to you like bullshit. I'd guess that's partly because you don't understand it. And I don't think you want to understand it. I'll be generous and assume you're capable. But try to wrap your head around some basic ideas: the climate exists; it can be changed; the most prolific species on the planet, which inhabits and affects almost all of it, could possibly affect the climate. Maybe if you could start with just grasping those basic concepts, you could start to open your mind to the idea of climate change.

&gt;You want evidence that people will die if we heavily restrict fossil fuel-based transportation and energy? What do you need besides common sense?

Again, you just don't seem to know the meaning of the word ""evidence"". Please try to find a dictionary and educate yourself.

But let's go ahead and try common sense:

&gt;Renewable energy is a luxury only first world countries can afford. Everyone else will just go without power and imported goods which == death.

Okay, so if you were the leader of a third world country, and the time comes for you to honor the climate deal. Which of these do you think you might choose to say to your people:

&gt;Good news, countrymen! We have decided to ratify the Paris agreement and will now cut off all electricity and imports, and millions of you will die! We must do this, you see, because I signed the paper already, and you know, no backsies.

-

The wine method i use i took 1oz Lotus (Nymphaea is what variety i used for wine, but have used both in tincture). I used a port wine and emptied some out of the bottle to make room for plant material. I also steeped some more flowers in water, essentially making a tea. I let it cool, strained and poured some of the water infusion into the wine (Keeping in mind it needs to stay alcohol enough to not go bad). I added honey to the wine, agitated the mixture occasionally. I basically followed a *variation* of [This](http://www.neurosoup.com/traditional-lotus-wine-a-manual-on-preparation-and-effects/) 'traditional lotus wine' method by neurosoup, but didn't take it as far as they do.

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","I find cohabitation data highly suspect for a number of reasons. The first is that divorce measurements seem inconsistent, which makes drawing strong conclusions always a bit iffy. Putting aside any questions about the quality of the data in the first place, it's *incredibly* hard to meaningfully control for all relevant factors and try to make sure what you're finding isn't just a covariant that predicts divorce rather than anything *causal*. It's easy to come up with hypotheses for cohabiters have higher divorce rates that wouldn't imply any sort of advice for other couples.

I think your general point is well taken, but I just don't think the evidence regarding cohabitation is all that compelling.

Regarding risk more broadly, the big correlates for high divorce rates are generally less likely to be present in the sort of people that stop and think about what sorts of things correlate with high divorce rates...

My point was that in both instances there was reliance on stereotypes for comedic effect, with the result of furthering existing negative stereotypes about minorities, and that sucks for minorities. 

Just because Indian people in Singapore weren't as heavily persecuted historically as Asian people in the US doesn't mean we can't see any parallels. We don't need two things to be 100% the same before comparisons can be drawn. That's the whole point of comparisons - to draw lessons from one thing and applying it to a different but somewhat similar thing. Even if the Chinese Exclusion Act didn't exist, or if those anti-chinese movies were made today, as an a person of East Asian descent I would still feel shitty if I watched a Hollywood movie with filled with stereotypes about East Asian people. In the end it's also just ""getting my feelings hurt"", but because it's my own ethnicity I naturally give more of a shit.

From experience (and the experience of virtually all of my female friends), I'll second that I've never come close to getting off from a one night stand, and the men I've hooked up with casually have never cared about getting me to orgasm. Sometimes they're completely inconsiderate, and it's not pleasurable whatsoever. 


I feel like young women have been fed a lie that hookup culture is good for them too. Young women are just different from young men, it doesn't work the same. They can't orgasm as easily, the social stigma associated with casual sex is far from gone from women, some deal with painful emotional attachment issues, and it's so much more unsafe when you factor in the possibility of rape and dealing with pregnancy scares by yourself.",1496275301

To a CC company that's just money in the bank.  

In your case, they have absolutely no record that you are reliable in making payments on time because they simply don't have any data to reference.  

So basically, to have the best credit score you need to have history that you can be trusted, combined with having few accounts with long histories of good payments, and a good debt to income ratio.

"minnesota","t5_2qhxs","When I worked up there, the theory was that the it's not some grand plan, on the part of legislators, but sheer inexperience and incompetence. In theory, this is a part time job and therefore only a narrow segment of the population could be legislators. People had to be independently wealthy, have spouse that had a high paying and stable job, retirees, etc. The staffers back then viewed a job at the capital as prestigious as working in DC or for a large city's mayor or city council. 

That has all changed. The pay is so low that legislators and staffers leave as soon as possible. Most legislators do a brief stint and leave for greener pastures or a lobbying position. A decade ago, a legislative assistant was likely a young woman who was a trained typist and secretary. Now, those positions are held by people with master's or law degrees. Everyone there has the right intentions but the incentives force people with talent to leave and invite people who don't plan on staying long. 

The result is that a few legislators dominate the process and negotiations with the governor are done with an eye towards a future mayoral campaign, or congressional race, and so on. Staffers need to be thinking about their next job, and between that, and their inexperience, they are no match for the governor's staff and administration. The governor's approval rating is above 60%. The GOP is only acting logically if you consider that their next ""promotion"" depends on appealing to the base of their party. 

That's what some of the old hands say at least. I'm not sure it is all right but I think the premise is right: this is incompetence due to the changing incentives of politics. ",1496275306

In grade school, the oxpecker/buffalo relationship was the prime example of mutualism, but we were taught wrong. A study from 2000 showed that oxpeckers were actually opening up wounds on hippos to drink the blood and eat scabs. They found that cattle could not heal wounds because oxpeckers were keeping the wounds open. Cattle with oxpeckers showed no smaller number of ticks.

A European stepped in and said, ""fuck, that's not the instructions for how to interact with police, it's the instructions for how to approach a wild animal.""

If the so-called employment wasn't going to cover living expenses, what good was it to begin with? All it does is inflate the number of employed people for statistics tracking, but if they cannot afford basic living expenses, then its moot anyway. 

What a lot of people fail to realize is that living expenses is money being spent. A poor person who gets extra money, is going to buy shoes, clothes, food, etc. It isn't being hoarded or removed from society, it's being immediately spent - which, if you recall, one person's spent money is another person's earned money.

More people spending money, means the stores need more cashiers, means paying those cashiers, means those cashiers spending money, etc.

In a pickle, had a few minor emergency situations that set me back this month (had to replace 4 tires due to vandalism, pay for towing, and a medical expense) and need some extra funds until my next payday (6/9/17) (direct deposit for ~$1700)

Funds will be divided for a small amount of groceries, dogfood, gas, and a few small bill payments and will be immediately repaid on 6/9/17

Will pay in full with interest, I'm thinking around $450 but willing to hear other offers.

I would prefer an etransfer/direct deposit or money gram for the sake of timing. I will however make a PayPal account or other account if absolutely necessary.

Thank you for you're time.

For me it's important to face what I've done to myself and not let it keep me trapped inside my head away from the rest of my life. Take a deep breath, let your skin heal today. I believe you can use Advil gel caps topically for pain and inflammation. If that doesn't work for you, take two and lay down with a clean towel and an icepack on your face listening to soothing music. Drink lots of water.

Try to be understanding for yourself. This isn't a thing we ever get over, we just learn to manage it over time.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I would note a few things:

1. Trump maintaining just 51% of his 2016 support in 2020 would be an electoral _disaster._  If he went from 63 million votes to 32 million, and say 25 million of those went to his democratic challenger, that would be a roughly 75% to 25% demolition in the popular vote.  At that size of swing, extrapolating linearly from 2016, Trump would win 1 electoral vote in Nebraska's 3rd congressional district.  The challenger would win the other 537.  That would be the biggest landslide victory since George Washington, and he ran unopposed.  All of this to say, losing ""most"" of his supporters is not at all necessary to him losing the election very badly.

2. Presidents have had their polls crater before to where they lost support of much of their prior base.  George W. Bush got into the 20s in 2008.  The economy tanking was a big part of that.  The economy could tank again!  Not even necessarily because of anything Trump is doing - just cause recessions happen now and then.  4 years is plenty of time for a recession to happen.  Truman and Nixon both also had [periods of terrible polling.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx)

3. I think you too narrowly define ""supporters"" when you think about these things.  People who loudly support Trump are hard cases to flip - it's a big change to scrape the bumper sticker off the car.  But the proper electoral way to think of it is anyone who votes for him for any reason.   Given Trump [got a higher percentage of the vote than viewed him favorably on election day,](http://www.gallup.com/poll/197231/trump-clinton-finish-historically-poor-images.aspx) there are lots of supporters in the ""voted for him"" definition who are persuadeable that he's not good.

This is because empathy (the ability to feel another's suffering as if it were your own) is one of the defining characteristics of human beings as a species. Excluding sociopaths, it is a universal phenomenon that we can all relate to. Rights come from that primal emotion/state of being.

This would work for games that the touchscreen doesnt change and is used purely for direction/or tap input 

Then you could use glovepie(maybe joy2key too) to route control stick directions on the gamepad to click specific points on kit-kat-touch's InputRedirect window (instead of moving the mouse manually to each location)

This way you could potentially turn the touchscreen input (which basically just replaces extra buttons in some games) into directional joystick movements.

"Absolutistneoreaction","t5_3g2sz","&gt; So **Evergreen's new President is re-arranging the organizational chart in a way that looks like it will undermine the voice of the faculty in making school-wide decisions.** He split College Advancement into two (Advancement and Relations), and hired on one of his buddies as the new Relations VP. He's also created a new provost role that looks like it will be in charge of faculty hiring and firing, which at a school without tenure is an incredibly powerful position. However, since the new provost role is a diversity-based role (Equity &amp; Inclusion Provost), it's politically complicated to be against it or the reorganization without coming across as being against diversity.
I'm guessing that this is a political maneuver, since if everything goes as expected, there will be no effective way for anyone to criticize decisions by the President, since the faculty won't rock the boat using their provost if there might be backlash from the hiring and firing provost, and I doubt the relations VP or the inclusion provost will cross their buddy George who got them the positions.
**I have the feeling that the student groups are being taken advantage of to destabilize the faculty's bargaining power enough to get these changes through without incident**, by making an example of Brett, who while certainly one of those self-absorbed college lecturer types isn't really a racist as far as I can tell.

The server never expected the popularity to get this way so it is all a learning curve on how to handle everything, the kinks will be worked out and rules/laws will change and be balanced out.

"DelphiMurders","t5_3jg93","Ok as YOU bought THE DOG up again, i'll tell you, I still stand by my view that the suspect has a dog in his jacket. SERIOUSLY! 

Call me a troll, it's not my intention to be one, but several people have also said they can see it.

If I'm ever proven correct I hope all the knockers will send me an applogy::)::)

I have to  say though since I first bought up the dog theory, it's everyone else who has been rehashing it, but since several have, I will now answer my critics.

The dog appears to be a Schnauzer/Terrier/Jack Russell type, he is small, maybe a puppy, with long legs for his small size.

The suspects chin appears to rest on the dogs head. The dogs face and nose IS the white thing protruding from his jacket at the top, note the black line of the dogs mouth.

The dogs body is strapped into his jacket creating the lumpy bulge.

The dogs legs are white and resting on the front of the suspects chest, hanging down the front.

The dog appears to have a black harness on with the front of his white upper body/haunches visible either side of the black harness and appears to have some brown markings although faint.

The dogs white tail sticks out by the suspects right wrist where a watch would sit.

The suspects thumb appears wrapped round the dogs rear foot which drops below his jacket while his other fingers are in his pocket trousers of his right hand.

The dogs ears are visible under the suspects chin and are brown.

The suspects jacket appears buttoned across the dogs legs to hold him in place.

The bridge is so dilapidated with missing rails it's obvious why a dog couldn't walk over it as it would fall through the cracks and could be why it's being carried.

I've been told the dog would be heard in a Voice recording and the police would most likely put the dog info out to help identify the suspect and I do agree with that, but you never know.

I think it's yet to be proven exactly how it all happened and theres a possibility a dog could have been put back in a vehicle before the girls were murdered.

I accept the dog is far from obvious to many but considering several are seeing it, it's worth considering as this would be an important clue, but seriously it's not worth getting all upset over as some do, because  if you don't see it fine,  but let's others decide.

Yes it clearly does. Tri-Rail stops at both Miami International and Fort Lauderdale International airports. It also stops in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Broward Blvd, downtown WPB on Australian, and downtown Miami via the MetroRail transfer. Tri-Rail costs $5 round trip and $5 for an all day pass on MetroRail which is cheaper than Brightline - hence my reservation this will be profitable. 

One of the most frustrating things is that Brightline runs on FLL airport property but doesn't have a stop there. If you're transferring between two airports, tri-rail is the only option. 

I'm not sure who is going to ride Brightline? All 3 stops are near dangerous areas or poverty stricken homeless areas (1st St in Miami, Stranahan Park in Fort Lauderdale, and Clematis St in WPB.)",1496275329

I'm glad your husband is there to support you through this, it's super validating knowing you aren't overreacting etc. to their abuse.

Fwiw that's part of what angered me in my situation as well. It was to the tune of ""If you can provide chat logs and further details, we can meet up and discuss to establish what really happened."" Like.. that's not how this works. They don't get to try and gaslight you *again*.

They sound awful, and it is difficult when they are older, but you have to stay strong and remember that they lack the capacity to see anything from a perspective other than their own. If your brother is NC, that just reinforces that you are not being unreasonable in doing so, too.

It's literally a fact that it's not good for kids to be exposed to violence.

Do you think it's good for children that are 5 years old to watch people shoot other people?

I highly commend you for sitting your kid down and explaining the difference between real life and video games. It's something MOST parents don't do unfortunately. 

Your child saying """"That's what he gets for messing with you huh?"" is already kind of a bad sign. You need to tell him that is NOT the case. You killing the other guy has NOTHING to do with him messing with you. It has to do with the fact that it is just a video game. Do not let him think anything else. Because what we think is ""common sense"" has no grounds with children because... They're developing it.  Do you get what I'm trying to get at?

"creepy","t5_2raed","&gt; ""…mmhnhm…"" moaned Serena softly into her gag, her eyes fluttering open. She squinted at the bright light filling the room, and immediately felt uncomfortable. The young trainer could feel her arms and legs aching a little, and to stretch her neck turned her head to the right. Much to her surprise, there lay Nurse Joy, her head propped up by her left hand. Serena's eyes shot open wide as she suddenly became aware of the unfamiliar hand sliding inside her panties.
&gt; ""Why hello there, Serena."" giggled Joy, her tongue slowly licking her top lip as she finished. Her hand was rubbing up and down across the little patch of hair inside Serena's panties, taking great pleasure in the reaction from her bound blonde. Serena's hips involuntarily lifted slightly to press against Joy's fingers, which greatly amused the pink haired nurse.
&gt; ""HMMNPHMN?!"" squealed the helpless young trainer as she shook her head violently at Joy, throwing her golden locks across her face. Serena tried to pull away from Joy, which proved very difficult with her arms pinned together underneath her and her legs bound so effectively. She wanted to look at what Joy's hand was doing inside her panties, but was still hoping to get some reason from her face. Joy lifted her body up a little and used her left hand to brush Serena's hair from her face, making sure to caress her cheek and forehead as she did so.
&gt; ""Shh, we're just going to have a little fun…"" whispered Joy, pressing her finger against Serena's gag to try and quiet her down. She was very much enjoying watching her captive's futile attempts to escape, or even to close her legs. Serena was trying to squeeze her legs together so tight that Joy's hand wouldn't be able to go any lower, but Joy giggled as they both knew that wouldn't work.
&gt; ""NMMHPNM! MMHMNPH!"" screamed Serena, her tongue pressing against her as as she closed her eyes and thrashed as much as she could, which thanks to Joy wasn't very much at all. Joy sighed and removed her hand from Serena's panties, instead bringing it sharply to her face and squeezing her cheeks together as tight as she could, holding her head still as Joy's other hand once more brushed strands of hair away from Serena's face.
&gt; ""I didn't want to have to do this, but…"" whispered Joy, her hand squeezing Serena's cheeks tightly. The helpless trainer's eyes widened and looked to the right as much as they could, sensing a slight change in the mood from Joy.
&gt; ""I think you're cute, that's why I caught you. So I'm going to play with you tonight whatever happens, and in case you haven't noticed, you're a little too bound and gagged to stop me. So you can either enjoy it with me, or…"" Joy trailed off slightly at the end of her sentence as she sat up a little, giving Serena, who gulped expecting some even worse news to follow, a good view of her face as she spoke.
&gt; ""…I could always put a collar and lead around this pretty little neck of yours, write 'Slaverena' on your ass and see if Team Flare will buy you. Now, I'd rather keep you all to myself, but…"" sighed Joy as she leant in closer to Serena's petrified face, who looked ready to cry.
&gt; ""We couldn't have my secret getting out now, could we? So, what do you say? I think you'll enjoy yourself tonight, you gorgeous little thing. I know I will."" winked Joy. Serena nodded frantically, her head moving the little Joy's hand would allow as her eyes fixed on those of her captor. C-cute? Gorgeous? No one beside's Shauna has ever called me those before, she thought, her mind trying to think of anything to blot out Joy's threat from a few moments ago.
&gt; ""Good girl."" Joy smiled and slowly drew her hand away from Serena's cheeks, taking her time to admire the sight of such a beautiful young trainer bound, gagged, half naked and nodding in obedience in front of her. It was going to be a wonderful night, thought Nurse Joy as she smiled.

Other redditors explained you that first and foremost people are reluctant to see the US meddling in the Middle-east affairs again because that trust has been broken a long time ago. So, it's not against the SDF per se, it's against the US interfering in the Syrian conflict to piss in Iran's cheerios, only to serve the US interests and those of their close allied. To a lesser extent, it's also against the servility of th SDF that doesn't seem to understand the repercussion of such a polarizing stance impose on the long term (I stated above that personally, I'm not sure they have other options tho).  


Assad is another topic, and I believe the vast majority here do want to see him step down, but not at any cost tho.

You are claiming that cooperation could not take place without tolerance, but that is an inconsistent metric for 'tolerance' given how you and the left so liberally pass the label of 'bigot' and 'racist' to Trump voters and the like. 

If it's true that you are tolerant if you are able to trade with people who are different than you, then that must mean conservatives are much more tolerant than you give them credit for? Or that means tolerance isn't necessary for economic cooperation? Or that means you are operating on a different definition of tolerance here than when you denounce tens of millions of people as racist, who somehow still manage to participate in the diverse economy?

**Legalities**

- None of any note, everything seems kosher

**Backstory:**

- I like it, your grammar is a bit rough, so it was difficult to read through easily.  But you thought out the background and reasoned through why this character has the ware he has.  And why he is who he is.  I like the character!


**Qualities:**

- You can take more positive and negative qualities if you wish (about 22 more points of each).  So one thing was unclear in your background, he grew up in the Papal States, but has a problem with Catholics.  I can't tell from the back ground, but it seems it's because somehow non-humans are persecuted against in the Papal States?


**Contacts:**

- Are okay, however a 1/1 academic.  He's basically useless, he'd get to roll 3 dice to tell you anything, which won't get you much.  I would suggest spending some more karma on him (perhaps by purchasing negative qualities) or change him around to a taxi or some such to make up for your lack of wheels.


**Attributes:**

- Are not really optimized, I would suggest taking a point each out of body and strength and putting them into Intuition and Reaction, and perhaps finding a way to pop one more point into agility.


**Skills:**

- Now, to the rub, your skills.  They're not very good.  In general you should try to do at least 1 thing very well 14+ dice, two things okay 12+ dice, and a couple other things in the 9-11 dice region.  Right now you got nothing above 10.  I would think real hard about what your character's main contribution to the team is.  Right now, I don't really see what that is.


**Special stuff (Magic, Resonance):**

- Your Spells are okay, bought with the 15 karma you had available.  But just like your skills, I would think twice about what you think your characters contribution to the team is.


**Augmentations:**

- Thematically they fit and give you a small boost.  I would be careful about walking around with Spurs.  Those are illegal, and because they are implanted in your meat arm will be easy to detect with cyberware scanners.


**Lifestyle:**

- Squatter lifestyle... you don't have enough to worry about getting jacked, but I need to question if you're going to make the minimum socials the hub requires.  I would suggest, just sticking to a low lifestyle.


**Armor/Weapons:**

- Fir the character


**Other Gear:**

- You got the bare minimum essentials.


**Vehicles &amp; Drones:**

- none",1496275334

You're trying to define alt right as purely just nationalism, so it has three distinct branches, but that is so incredibly far from the truth. Alt right is its own distinct ideology, your idea that it's nationalism vs globalism means it's altright or everyone else, which is ludicrous.

My guess?

She wanted an audience.

When you accepted her demand to send the pictures, it opened a new line of communication, which she grabbed onto; The whole idea of taking pictures as having a proxy 'you' present there. She more or less implied seeing it as much when she asked for the exhaustive pictures from you to ""feel part of the move""

So now she's got a little 'you' in her phone, and she takes a picture to reinforce that 'you' are there. It doesn't matter if you actually look at the pictures in reality; that's not the point. This is a proxy for you, that she can project whatever she wants 'you' to feel, and since there exists the real possibility of you seeing the pictures, my guess is that is enough of a link for her to make it work.

So she towed you along as a silent observer, to be jealous of her, adore her, be there to be mocked or derided, be there to support her narrative of the day, whatever she needed. 'Click', you're there. 'Click', you're there. 'Click', you're *there.*

yes, of course one cow can be many items, the 1,300 number is for one quarter pound (1/4 lb) of beef.  So one cow would be a whole lot more.  The numbers from last year so it may be different but not by much.  It factors in the water used to produce the food we feed the cows as well.  Cows eat a lot.

Community is the root of morality and it's a concept that has been at odds with the drive for self-preservation since we started using communities as an evolutionary advantage.

But (here comes me just bullshitting out loud) evolution was only able to instill a basic tribalism in us before we effectively jumped out of the rest of the world's food chain. Now a group of humans' only predator is other groups of humans, and unless we want to kill each other off our only hope is using our consciousness to continue to push for a cohesive community of the entire society over that lizard-brain drive for preservation of individuals or groups. Unfortunately this isn't much of an option when there is massive disparity of power between people (wealthy, politicians, etc. having more) and groups (global power countries, corporations, etc. having more).",1496275338

&gt;All that matters is that the votes are there.

1.  The votes aren't there, so who gives a shit.

2.  If you impeach a GOP President for some trivial shit like ""being a shitty President"", what do you think the GOP is going to do to the next Democrat President?  Think, please.

&gt;Question: is the media lying that Comey is going to testify that Trump asked him to lay off Flynn or is Comey lying that that happened?

Who gives a shit about unverified info from anonymous sources that the CNN and their ilk report as truth?  Most of the time those are nothing but rumors, which is why they're so frequently at least partially wrong, no matter the Presidency.

&gt; I work for a Fortune 300 Company and the details of our ESPP is as follows: 

&gt; Max contribution of 10% of base salary. 

&gt; This contribution is made bi-weekly through payroll and then at the end of each quarter the purchase of shares are made at a 10% discount. 

&gt; These shares must be held for at least three months before they become available to sell. 

&gt; The company also has a 3-4% quarterly dividend which is automatically reinvested at a 5% discount.

&gt; If I am missing some other helpful ESPP point let me know.
&gt;   
&gt; Most questions I have seen have been different in the fact that the employee can sell immediately and no dividend was mentioned.  
&gt;   
&gt; Should I be selling as soon as I can (every quarter and facing a disqualified position, taxed at personal income rate, 25%) which seems to be the consensus for plans that vest immediately. Or should I hold till the shares become qualified positions (18 months from vesting, taxed at long term gains, 15%) and let dividends compound? Or some other strategy.  
&gt;   
&gt; Thank you

Basically anything and everything that I find that surfaces out my mind or experience in life that seems noteworthy gets written down.

While backpacking through SEA, every time I met someone new I wrote down their name, how I met them and interesting things I learned about them.  After my travels were over I was able to flip through and remember all the folks I met along the way.

For me, there is one additional aspect to it - to figure out if the current work is good for you, you have to do it for some time. You can't just skip from workplace to workplace every couple of months and say - nope, that's not for me. 


With time and experience, you can achieve a certain attitude, like - every obstacle is a chance for me to prosper. That is my way of dealing with problems at work.


Making ahead in your career also presents you with chances to see and experience more, finding a new interest in the field. Example: moving from programmer to consultant, from consultant to project manager, from project manager to partner...etc.

-don't focus on pace, listen to your body and adjust accordingly
-take rest days when needed. I've taken whole weeks off and it's done wonders for my pace/endurance
-attire is everything. Avoid cotton, and a supportive sports bra is a must (if you're well endowed) I've got a few with underwire from Amazon and they have made a huge difference in comfort/reducing back pain. 
-listen to your body. If you feel like you're over doing it, slow down. If you're not feeling ready to increase pace or distance or time intervals, just don't. Your body will tell you what it's ready for all you've got to do is listen. 

And finally, don't let your brain tell you that you can't. Trust the process. If you put in the work, the program will work for you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Firstly, if you like free time, this isn't for you. Personally, I like being busy so I'm fine with going to school full time and working. If you can, schedule your classes for half the day (morning to early afternoon, for example) and work for the other half (mid afternoon to night). I try to be done with classes at 2pm because I found that gives me an hour to do my homework before starting work at 4pm. If you have a major that involves lots of late labs or classes, this is going to be harder. You're probably not going to have a day off, except for statutory holidays. Taking spring and summer classes are a godsend for freeing up your schedule. I take electives in the spring and summer and required classes in the fall and winter.

Secondly, manage your money carefully. I live in a dirt cheap apartment in a shitty neighbourhood in a building that's probably not being run entirely legally. Knowing how to cook is also really important. Even McDonald's can get expensive if you eat out every day. I found buying cheap food in bulk and shopping around carefully is key to saving money on food. I have an embarrassingly large amount of rice but there's so many nutritious and cheap meals you can make with it. 

Find a way to save on school. I'm going to university on grants and bursaries, with some student loans to top it off. Now, if you're American, this is harder because your post-secondary is so insanely expensive and you have to foot the cost for so much longer. Sometimes I have to pay for textbooks out of pocket but otherwise I can concentrate my money things like rent and food, with some luxuries thrown in. I'm also in a relatively cheap major.

Lastly, don't focus all your energy on work and school. It's really easy to burn out. If you have time, hang out with your friends or if you're on good terms with your parents, visit them or call them sometimes. I do my best to make sure I have classes with at least one friend and I try to make friends with people at work. I also have a cat but before getting a pet, make sure you're allowed to have one, you have the time to take care of it, and you can afford one.

If your contractual requirements amount to a 160 hour week (about which i recommend you document in a diary to prove^(i appreciate that's more work but it might help) as well as seek immediate medical attention), I recommend you speak to a labour lawyer.  I doubt you'll be unionised?  There will be some analogue of Citizens Advice in america, no?  If not, I'm sure there's a subedit for that.  Ask them about the legality of the contract.  I know american labour law is bad but i really doubt it's that bad.  There might be some process by which you can either get compensated properly, or keep your job but with a reduced workload.

"ClickerHeroes","t5_32820","I think the trick is to dish out the 80 HS to gild Brittany the Beach Princess. I was lucky to have her get gilded 2x when  getting to a 10th level along the way. What's amazing is that I also gilded all of the 'power 5s' ppl too. I now have her at 4xGild and level 1150. She's not that expensive to level up compared to Betty or Samurai, and at this point I still can't buy Dread Knight. By that point I'm sure I can make enough scratch to level up Samurai instead.

Also, is there transcendence in the console version? I've been reading several guides and they're all confusing 
It says after u transcend the Ancients get more expensive, I think?, but I also read that if u don't transcend things slow down a lot.

Ok, at level 289 now, cause Beach Princess is now at level 1185 so my idle is crazy, at 266d DPS and 2,223N clicker damage from a relic that gives me +40% click damage. 

Sorry to keep updating this. Are you using the boosts energize, Dark Ritual and Reload, in that order? It helps me a lot. I just hit level 300 and no, there is no transcendence.

You've been extremely heated while he's reacted cool-ly, and that also takes wind out of your position (Indicated by the up/down vote trends).

That being said, both sides have a point, but while he's acknowledged yours, you've refused to make the same effort.

Yes, luck plays a massive role in the successes and failures of life. But it's luck. You can't change it, so why dwell on it? If you instead focus on what you can change, you can make steps in a positive direction.

You didn't like my lasso example, so how about bow and arrow. If you ask most people what they'd choose to use in a self-defence situation they'd say a gun. Almost no one would tell you they'd like a big ol compound bow for self defense. Why is that? Arrows aren't *more dodgeable* than a bullet, and in terms of lethality they're actually more dangerous. Seems to check all the boxes, right? And yet would you prefer to defend yourself against a home intruder with a bow or a gun?

The facts of the matter are these: We know it is possible, yet we see very few people do it.

So one must farm food or hunt/gather it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/GameDeals/comments/62r9d8/wingamestore_mafia_iii_149975_mafia_iii_digital/

Honestly, given how repetitive M3 base-game actually is (destroy X areas, destroy X items, defeat X enemies, take over X area, etc) - you might actually want the extra DLC's, if the Digital Deluxe Edition is just a few bucks more.

Faster Baby wasn't long, mind you - maybe 2-3 hours, or so - but having a few missions that were more car-based + vehicle-based helped out quite a bit, breaking up the repetitive nature of M3 base-game content.

The story in M3 base-game is fantastic, though. I do need to finish it, mind you - but I had to get away from the game b/c of its repetitiveness. Given that the other 2 DLC's are out now, maybe I should go back to it, sometime soon - that could be what I need just to get over the hump here to want to get the DLC's done.


EDIT:

I should note, Steam has me clocked in at 23 hours in the full version, so far. Keep in mind, I spent about a good 3 hours in the Demo, which pretty much is the opening (excellent) Chapters of the game. So, around 26 hours or so, approximately in total w/ M3 so far.",1496275348

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; you can live on a farm and grow your own food

There is a finite supply of land. In order to obtain access to land needed for any economic activity, there has to be unoccupied rent-free land left over for you to claim, you have to have enough savings to purchase the land from someone else, you have to make rent payments to a landlord, or you have to make mortgage payments to a bank.

Income and sales taxes hinder the probability that residents are able to do any of those, even if they are not directly assessed a high tax.

This is because when government spends on territorial goods such as parks, police, roads, infrastructure, courts, and military, it raises the value of land in the area to which these public goods apply. When these goods are funded via a tax on the labor or products of residents rather than a tax on landholders, it allows landholders to charge higher rent for residents, and to earn greater profits from land speculation without putting the land to use, limiting the supply of land available for production.

This means that everyone who does not already own land outright must pay more to obtain it. Income and consumption taxes means residents must save more to buy land, pay higher rent to landlords for apartments, and pay higher mortgages to banks. This would not be the case if government spending was financed only via a single land value tax, as the incidence of the tax would fall only on landholders.",1496275349

"nyjets","t5_2s2av","To answer your first question, I believe Hansen and Peake may both have a shot at special teams as do Stuwart, but I think we would keep 6 WR's just to keep both of them as depth, assuming Peake isn't cut in training camp. Why not help out our Qb's and give them some weapons to work with, and keep a good supply of them in case of injuries? We also have Decker's health to think about, too. Who knows how many years he has left with the team?


If I were Morton, I'd keep all 6 and still run a considerable amount of 4 WR (not as much as Gailey though). Our receiver corp is still a strength of this team, even if it isn't a strong one anymore. We have a lot of potential with these young guys so we have to put them out there and see what we got. They need the experience, too. 4 wide spread looks can only help our Qb's to make it easier to read the defense.  I'd keep that aspect of Gailey's offense and some of his passing concepts the same. 
Like you, I don't expect much of Stewart's rookie year, but he can carve out a role as a utility guy with who can make plays with the ball in his hands, None of our current WR's have that kind of skill set, so can make a niche for himself. He can give Morton an added dimension to his offense while giving our QB's less to do in our offense.

If I were a top 10 WR recruit, I'd absolutely go with Clemson. There is a reason guys like Watkins, Hopkins, M.Williams, M. Bryant and others played here. Those stats give you attention, and attention is good for the draft boards. People know my pedigree as a recruit and my athletic profile, so I might as well have the insane inflated stats to get me over the top. One year in that offense is all I really need. Its hard to pick Alabama for the reasons you mentioned. Id have to be guaranteed I'd always be the first option and have the Qb force-feed me the ball for me to consider. And even then, my production will suffer because a bad Qb will struggle to consistently put the ball where I want it. I can go get it, sure, but better ball placement can make a difference between big plays and incompletions/interceptions. Stewart had to deal with that. And this situation ruined Deandre Hopkins season, and he thrived playing with sub-par QB's. 

Glad to see you agree with Landry comparison. He will probably never make plays the way Landry does, but can thrive in his role. I think our offense is loaded with young X-type receivers, but we need some Z's to complement the passing game, too. I am very optimistic with his outlook as an NFL player. I think he has the tools to put it together. ",1496275349

-doubling (ie 2^n)

-increasing

-bounds on the data (in your example, where could the doubling/increasing properties break down?)

-what other phenomena exhibit this pattern? (is this a link to Si?)

-what would happen if i tweaked things in the data (starting points, context)

etc...

it seems like maybe intuitives operate in the space of possibilities/relationships more easily than in the space of real sensory experiences?

however, even though i always associated N with abstraction/patterning - maybe my Ne actually links Si metadata - and the Si metadata stores/searches for these patterns?

how would Si metadata differ from Ni metadata? could the metadata be similar, but obtained through different cognition patterns?

Now we have a mainstream audience who don't understand drag or drag queens and expect it to be Sesame Street. That's why queens are so guarded when they go on and that's why you get ""fans"" complaining there isn't enough drama. You want drama but then you'll crucify a queen for a dirty look or a shady remark- they can't win. 

Added to the fact that we now have this contingency of young people who obsess over certain queens and freak out when their favs fuck up. The way people overreacted about mask gate was pathetic and it's really put me off the DR community. 

Unfortunately, it's not really something you can control. It's like the snake that eats itself. A show starts of as a cult classic, gains popularity, peaks and then the mainstream get a hold of it and drag it down.

The truth is that the YPG/YPJ in Syria and the Peshmerga in Iraq have been far more effective in liberating areas from ISIS and instituting secular government than the US has in its time there. I would support people's liberation's movements who want it, facilitating the travel of volunteers and supplying weapons to secular movements in the region.

I break my biscuit up in a bowl and pour Gravy over it and then I will break bacon up over top like some kinda white trash Sunday. Shit is good, yo. ",1496275355

&gt; Many creationists mistakenly think that evolution states one type of organism can change into another type of organism. This is, to put it mildly, wronger than wrong. 

I had a feeling it was, lol. So, evolution would state that humans are a variant of old world apes, which died out due to natural selection/survival of the fittest, right? That's a little more clear to me now.

&gt; Emotions have an evolutionary advantage. Things that aren't afraid of dying often die and don't reproduce.

For example, my guess is that the implementation of health care laws would be parked with Health &amp; Human Services. I also think you're right in that the feds step in as needed (as in the rollout of ACA). The biggest difference between this system and a full time legislature is that new laws cannot be passed without the governor calling a special session.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; I disagree. You would just supplant volunteers or possibly paid positions with criminal offenders. Those things are better left to people doing them willingly or in exchange for monetary compensation, to ensure quality and also to stimulate lawful employment. 

The sorts of activities we're talking about are low to no skill.  Volunteering doesn't guarantee quality, and motivated volunteers will always find something to do.  There's no shortage of community oriented tasks that require a donation of time. 

&gt; The idea of a fine is to discourage criminal/reckless behavior, and I can't think of any more effective ways to do so than hitting the wallet of the offender. That cuts more efficiently into leisure time than taking a few hours out of a weekend. 

Something warranting a fine that cuts sufficiently into the wallet would also take out more than a few hours of a single weekend.  If it's a sufficient offense to warrant a fine that might need to be handled as a payment plan then it'd likely end up being multiple weekends (or whatever *would* be enough to make it sting).  With a fine and a payment plan you have to readjust your budget, with community service you have to readjust a significant portion of your down time and schedule which many of us regardless of age value highly. 

What's being missed here also, and is a systemic issue with our criminal justice system, is the fact that punishment is not sole purpose.  Rehabilitation and correction are the primary (or should be the primary) focuses of the criminal justice system.  Community service has a better chance of teaching an offender a bit of civic responsibility than being forced to pay a fine. 

&gt; I'd argue that the only ones that benefit from community service is young people, in which it can inspire a sense of civic responsibility. In working adults, that should know better than to drive unsafely, it's a waste of time and effort when you can just take their money and put it towards someone more deserving. 

Hardly.  People of any age can be inspired to be more responsible, community oriented, and conscientious of the implications their actions have on others.  That's the whole point of reform.  And as I've pointed out, young people who want to volunteer will find a way to do so.  

It's also entirely possible that the majority receiving traffic violations will be young people (including young adults) who haven't matured to the point of caring about how their actions effect those around them.  With the practice of fining, you only hit them in the wallet and make their lives more difficult with out teaching them anything of value.  ",1496275356

Personally, I have enjoyed this campaign a lot, and the transition (and cut parts) solve a lot of the gripes that people had with HotDQ to begin with (lack of character motivation, railroad-y, poorly balanced in Greennest). If you go this way, Rise of Tiamat goes up to 14th (possibly ending at 15th) level, so it can go on for quite some time - SKT (and I think CoS) only go up to level 10.",1496275358

"trap","t5_2qx81","I'll only rate artists relevant to /r/trap's interests

RL Grime - 10/10, 9/10, 7/10 - Saw him twice in 2015 and once in 2016, lots of variation in sets between mid 2015 and end of 2015, but his set in mid 2016 was quite similar to the last one I'd seen.

Quix - 10/10 - A beast on the decks, has a style of music nobody else does, never recycles sets from what I've seen

WSN - 6/10 second time mid 2015, 9/10 mid 2016, was rolling too hard to remember him when I first saw him in 2014

Skrillex - 10/10 - A god, what else can you say

Troyboi - 7/10 festival set, 5/10 Mantra tour - song selection at his festival set was generally good but yah poor mixing

Ekali - 9/10, extremely good.

Marshmello - 2/10 mid 2016, 3/10 early 2017, give him a miss unless you really like his brand of bubblegum trap.

Jack U - 5/10 mid 2016, very disappointing, big fan of their work but they just mashed up a bunch of festival trap songs with pop rap songs even if they didn't work together, Skrillex solo was sooo much better. 

GTA - 9/10, heard bad things about their festival sets being very generic but saw them headline a solo show of theirs in a small club and they THREW DOWN, played all their trap bangers and they have a lot of those. 

Snails - 8/10, plays the same set every festival but very fun the first time.

Flume - 2/10, controversial I know but thought his Skin tour was so overhyped, visuals were amazing but performance wise he may as well have pushed play on a spotify playlist of his songs, all of them played out completely and faded into the next song. Would prefer to be able to dance when I attend shows also, and his music is not very dancey at all. 

Major Lazer - 4/10, too much time on the mic, some is fine but not if you're just too lazy to mix.

Gladiator - 9/10, top lads and played a great fucking set also.

Sam Gellaitry - 3/10, was the ultimate disappointment as a huge fan of his music, seemed like he just mixed Escapism II, he was in the opening slot of a festival though so maybe it was deliberate to keep it very low energy but I left disappointed.

Slumberjack - 6/10, standard festival set

Other non-trap artists:

Drezo - 8/10

Destructo - 10/10, why is this guy not more popular, I feel like trap has peaked and house is rising again and if he released Party Up today it would be bigger than it was.

Zedd - 9/10, like Snails he plays the same set every festival but the first time its amazing. ",1496275363

Rubberset, Simms, no markings, half plastic/half wooden handle - has an R inside a circle along with set in rubber and made in Canada. 

Razors: 
Top one in the case is a Parat - not sure yet if it belongs to the case yet or not but is the Rocket family so maybe. I have to research more 
Middle row L to R - plastic handle Tech - I think it's a mash of parts. The base plate appears to be from a black handle gold Tech, handle is obviously a black plastic Tech and the top cap I am not certain as their are two short bars instead of the on single bar to secure the razor blade. Next is the red flare tip SS, a Canadian fat handle Tech and an English tech. 
Bottom is a Wardonia and then what appears to be an Old type open comb that may have had a run in with a herd of water buffalo - the handle is in rough shape but the head looks very good. 

One place had a few old GEM style SE blades so I grabbed them to try my Ever Ready 1912 out with.

&gt; When ExxonMobil Corp. shareholders voted for an historic climate-change resolution Wednesday, mutual-fund giant Vanguard and small investors like Sister Nora Nash were among them.

&gt; At past shareholders meetings, Vanguard generally votes with ExxonMobil management, but has sometimes voted against.

&gt; Though environmentalists declared the ExxonMobil vote a victory, &amp;quot;It is non-binding,&amp;quot; noted Dan Wiener, a long-time Vanguard investor and Brooklyn-based publisher of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter.

Try a voltage divider with a combined resistance of about 100kohm or a bit more.
You might want to add an opamp buffer to the output of the voltage divider to minimize the effects of the input impedance of the ADC.

He publicly mocked a former beauty pageant contestant in 2016 because she criticized him.  He famously criticized the parents of that dead soldier because they spoke against him.  There are countless other examples.  He is a terrible person, nobody fucking says he is a nice guy. If you don't think that then you just aren't paying attention.

2) He has no relevant experience to being president.  By all accounts he does not read things and does not use email.  He divulged secret information with Russia by accident.  He can't form coherent sentences when he isn't speaking from a teleprompter.  He has no coherent vision for any policy matter, except his retarded wall.

3) is he corrupt???  He and his family are making deals with foreign leaders related to their personal businesses.  He has refused to divulge his tax information.  He tried to pressure the FBI director to stop investigating collusion with Russia.  He continues to insist the ""Russia story is fake news"" when everyone in the intelligence services across multiple countries as well as members of his own party and most of the country agree that it is not.  If this is not corruption, what the fuck is corruption??? 

4) If another president were lying as much as Trump I would criticize them just as much.  They are not, and I am not defending lies from past presidents. YOU are defending lies from the current president by just sticking your head in the sand and shouting ""but obama"".  Which is also hilarious because Trump's lies are things which are just blatant falsehoods, like ""Obama wiretapped me"" or ""I had the largest inauguration crowd"".  For you to compare that to minor discrepancies like Obama saying we are producing more steel than ever to Trump making these statements which no research is even required to debunk is just pathetic.

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","Sure. So I began writing articles for this website Prepare for Change, and adopted a pseudonym, under which I created a Facebook page. I accepted all friend requests on this page, and then eventually starting accepting strangers on my personal page as well. He slipped through the cracks, commenting on a few pics and being friendly, and a few private messages that I barely paid attention to because my messages were always blowing up at this point. Looking back, the signs were all there he was a conniving weirdo. BUT I was too busy being a prophet, so it's all LoveNLight, right?

I went to the beach with my best friend one day with her boyfriend and his friends, which began as a lovely day. I then started acting off and embarrassing my friend. Yadda yadda, huge fight, I tell her to just leave me there. Little did I know this was the last time I would see my best friend of 15 years. Yep, I was THAT crazy. She just didn't get it...

So, I pulled out a credit card, picked a cute hotel and commenced having my own fun. Well, he had asked if he could meet up with me that weekend anyways and was willing to drive three hours to the beach. So I said why not? He got there and I decided he was a spirit come to test me (see above answer) and he just kind of...took over. I was scared but thought I could handle him.  He drove me back to my town and continued to his town about 1.5 hours away. Yeah, a spirit did all these things btw. Because he had 23 on his hat. This is how my mind was working at the time. One day, my mother drove to see me at this hotel and I offered for her to spend the night and we could drive back home together the next day (remember my friend left me there, no car). Unfortunately, she decided to just go home, which gave me time to meet this person. I even told her I was meeting someone, and she didn't stay even though I was acting very strangely. It's not her fault, but one of the many things that could have happened differently. 

So, he stays the night with me. Nothing weird there, to me. He drives me home to my town, then invites me to come have dinner in his town later that night. But something weird happened that afternoon. The middle of my head snapped. That's the only way I can think of to describe it. It happened during a set meditation time with my weirdo group (remember, ""The Shift"" was due any time now) and I seriously felt strange after this thing happened to my head. So my phone starts blowing up about our ""date,"" and I told him I wasn't up to driving. He flipped out and told me he'd come get me. So yeah, I'm in his car, driving to who knows where, completely vulnerable because I honestly believed something of extreme spiritual importance had happened to me... I started babbling about ""is this it? Is this the fifth dimension?"" type stuff, and he just went right along with it. It was so easy for him. So to make a very long and scary story short, I cavorted around with him for about two months with ever changing beliefs about his purpose/form/identity, where I was, the purpose of our meeting. I could have gotten out. I could have gotten away from him several times before my life got ruined, but I refused to see reality. This was pure mania. He took about half my life savings from me...well, I handed it over willingly because why not? When the aliens took over we'd all have new money anyways. Then when we weren't together, which was often, I blew the rest of my money on shit I don't even remember, including expensive hotels because I wouldn't go home to my mother who was now the enemy...and he knew I was nuts so why would he spend any more time with me than necessary? And racked up thousands on credit cards to boot. I was in communication with my sister but not my mother, who I basically disowned and left clueless about how bad things were. Damn, if only she'd called and heard me. I don't know. 

Anyways, to this day I do not know what he originally wanted with me. I think he saw a pretty girl close by who had some money (due to my travel photos). Then it was obvious once we met face to face I was batshit crazy and he milked me dry. It was easy. I would have been homeless if my mom didn't take me in afterwards. I met him in July and by October it was all done. Maybe, maybe he read the Prepare for Change website and knew the weird stuff I was into. I'm not sure. I will never know. It was awful and changed how I see myself forever. I had been saving money since I was sixteen and it was all just GONE. All because I had to become public with my ""writing name"" and accepted every friend request. Luck of the fucking draw. ",1496275369

&gt; When ExxonMobil Corp. shareholders voted for an historic climate-change resolution Wednesday, mutual-fund giant Vanguard and small investors like Sister Nora Nash were among them.

&gt; At past shareholders meetings, Vanguard generally votes with ExxonMobil management, but has sometimes voted against.

&gt; Though environmentalists declared the ExxonMobil vote a victory, &amp;quot;It is non-binding,&amp;quot; noted Dan Wiener, a long-time Vanguard investor and Brooklyn-based publisher of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter.

And you can't argue de gea is not right up there with neuer as being one of the best keepers in the world.

£60m for him would be a steal if you compare the price juve paid for buffon 16 years ago. I want him to stay but he has been great for us and wouldn't have hard feelings if he wanted to go home to madrid.

The best 2 keepers in the world right now are de gea and neuer, its debatable who's actually the best because they are totally different keepers and have different play styles. Neuer is 31, de gea is 26. Shit... if we lost de gea and we could get neuer (31) for 60m to serve the next 4-5 years I would be a very happy fan. So I'm not sure why people are saying a keeper is not worth that kind of money.

"creepy","t5_2raed","&gt; Serena tried her best to calm down, closing her eyes and breathing as slowly and deeply as she could. Joy looked on at her captive's chest once more, rising and falling as Joy gently stroked the young trainer's head, threads of golden hair running between her fingers. It was a shame to have to scare her, thought Joy, but it'll be worth it. She continued, waiting for Serena's eyes to open and her breathing to return to normal.
&gt; After a short while, Serena opened her eyes once more, looking into Joy's and mumbling something into her gag. Joy's hand on her head felt nice, pressing on all the right places as her fingers flowed through her hair. The helpless trainer pulled her head up a little and tried to say something to Joy again, her words muffled by the plug in her mouth.
&gt; ""I'll do the talking tonight."" giggled Joy, holding her finger up to her own lips. Her right hand slid down her body until it reached her hips, where it began to pull her black panties smoothly down her thigh. She sat up for the final pull, the panties leaving a trail of her juice down her legs as they came off. Joy held the sopping wet panties in a bunch, hovering above Serena's face. Serena moaned quietly into her gag, wincing a little as she felt the smell pour into her nose.
&gt; ""Serena is such a pretty name, it suits you. We wouldn't want it to get dirty though, right?"" grinned Joy, half visible to Serena behind the wad of wet panties. The half naked blonde squirmed a little, her eyes fixated on the scrunched up panties and still trying to get her arms a bit more comfortable as the scent of Joy's juice filled her nostrils.
&gt; ""Tonight, I think Sluterena is a little more appropriate, don't you?"" said Joy, still smiling as her free hand began to unscrew the plug from her helpless toy's mouth. Serena blushed and looked away from her captor on hearing her new nickname. Why was this so embarrassing, considering everything else that was going on, she wondered. She felt the thick rubber plug turning as Joy's hand twisted, her tongue able to stretch a little further each time as the plug slowly came out.
&gt; ""…mmuhllmnh…"" Serena tried to plead with Joy again, this time without the plug blocking her tongue. She was surprised to find that this time it wasn't the now removed plug that was stopping her from speaking, but also the metal ring between her top and bottom jaw that Joy gave a light tug to amuse herself. Her tongue writhed uselessly in an attempt to form some pronounceable words for a few moments before as it was hanging out mid would-be-word, Joy pressed the soaking bundle of panties on top of it, directly into Serena's mouth.
&gt; ""Mmmhpmhmff!"" the young blonde's tongue was drenched in Joy's juice as the wet panties were pushed into her mouth, and every time she tried to curl her tongue a little more came out. Serena's eyes were wider than ever as she looked up at the grinning Joy, who's single finger was holding the soaking bundle inside Serena's mouth.
&gt; ""After all, a good girl wouldn't have my panties stuffed in her mouth right now, would she?"" beamed Joy as she wiggled her finger on the panties, rubbing them more and more across Serena's helpless tongue. The captive trainer's initial protest had softened into a continuing quiet moan, the two girl's eyes still meeting as Joy once more brought the rubber plug up to Serena's full mouth.
&gt; ""That's right, Sluterena. Take my panties like a good little bitch, and make sure you taste all of it, okay?"" grinned Joy, rubbing her thighs together as she pushed the plug once more to meet the ring inside Serena's mouth. This only pushed the panties harder against her tongue, and as Joy began to screw the plug back in place Serena knew she'd be tasting Joy for a while to come. The sickly sweet taste rolled down her tongue and into the back of her throat constantly, and she stared up at Joy as the plug was fully returned into her mouth.

Credit wise, yes, if you have a job, you should have a credit card, or atleast a debit card. Just remember to pay off the credit card, and thus your credit will raise. The higher the credit, the better vehicles, houses, etc that you'll be approved for. 

You don't have to worry about getting a loan, yet. Unless you need one to get a house, car, etc and can't afford it out right.

So, annually you mostly just need to do your taxes. If you don't have the know how to rock Turbo Tax or have a trustworthy friend, then go to like H&amp;R Block. You'll need an ID, Social Security card, and maybe even Birth Certificate. (Birth Certificates are $20 from your local records office/courthouse, SS card $15 bucks from DHS, and I.D's are cheap from DMV)

Buy necessities before fun stuff. Bills must be conquered first. Bills, then videogames. Say it with me ""Bills first, video games second.""

You'll need a haircut, it's part of adulting.
Then buy a nice pair of khaki pants, an $80 black long sleeve full button up, a black leather beat, one pair of nice black leather shoes, and a pair of black socks. Don't forget to also wear a cheap, non digital watch. Take your piercings out too. 
That set up can be worn from anything to job interviews, funerals, weddings, fun out on the town, dates, etc. (Roll the sleeves for fun out with the guys. Roll the sleeve just above the elbow) 

Don't smoke cigarettes, not even to ""look cool,"" because it doesn't look cool, it just gives you rancid breath that the sex you're attracted to is not into whatsoever. 

Get a gym membership, it's something everyone owes themselves. 

Eat half ass healthy, but have a cheat day with pizza or poutine. 

Other than that life is simple. Enjoy it. Take a deep beath, we will dominate the Earth.

I don't go on dates with guys that don't support equality because I only date male feminists. My observations of guys does not equate to the guys I date. I'm quite fortunate that I don't seem to have the experiences most gals do.

Though I do enjoy how if a gal dates an asshat then she's probably bad at choosing her dates. You are aware that studies show most guys do not do equality in orgasms, childcare, or household duties. So the options for a gal are limited. Most likely unless a gal severely limits her options she will be picking from the majority of the male population...and they don't do equality.

&gt;I dated someone a while back and after 2 dates of me paying and them not even saying ""thanks"" I confronted them about it (politely).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Nope.  There are three branches of the federal US government.  The Executive Branch, which is comprised of the president, the Vice-President, and the various Cabinet members.  The president can sign bills into law if they pass through a majority vote in Congress.  He's also the Commander in Chief of the military and usually acts as the US Representative when dealing with foreign nations.

The Legislative Branch is the US Congress, which is broken down into the Senate (100 members, 2 per state) and the House of Representatives (435, varies by each state's population).  In order for a bill to be signed, it must pass by majority vote in both the House and Senate.  It then goes to the President to be signed into law.  If he refuses, or vetoes, then the bill is passed back into Congress.  Congress can then override the veto with a 2/3rd majority in both the House and Senate.  So while the President holds a lot of power, he can be overruled.

In this case however, the Paris Agreement isn't a United States law.  It's a foreign treaty.  In this case, it may have been passed through congress to allow President Obama to sign it (which he did), but there's nothing that can be done within the US Government to prevent President Trump from backing out.  That responsibility falls to the United Nations.  Hopefully they'll give him hell over it.",1496275375

She almost didn't hear Tokasu when he told her about seeing the ninja running off in the same direction during their escape.*

""You saw two of them head of in the same direction?""Dai asked back. ""If that's true its going to be a good start to finding where they went."" Dai turned to Mukai. ""I don't know if anyone knew them or not worth checking out before we head out though.""

*Dai heads off to interview a few more of the residents. This time she asked them about knowing any of the attackers. Many of them immediately dismissed the idea. A few of them took a minute to think about it and consider if they had seen them before. A few of them mentioned that they would have remembered meeting people with horns, and that it was a ridiculous question.*

*While Dai was out interviewing the residents she came across a group of people who were quite injured. They were trying to get help for one man in particular he seemed to be bleeding out. Dai rushed over to help him. She used her mystic palm technique on the man and channeled it over the course of a few minutes before the man seemed to regain consciousness.*

Dai returned to where Mukai and Tokasu were. ""Well Mukai looks like we're just going to have to track them. None of the civilians seemed to have any idea who the attackers were or had even seen them in any capacity before either. So are you two ready to go and find them?""",1496275376

For an easy fling, she's asking a lot of you, it would seem. Also, she's married, yes? I ask because I could imagine she may need (or her spouse may need) some limits or boundaries that you do not. 

I am pretty sure it's not cool to say to someone that you're greedy or you should be happy with what you have (not what you need/want). 

You'll sort it out but that's a lot to process. It would seem helpful to sort some of this out before introducing her to Skydiver.

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","I feel like I've encountered a bug with the speed up function.  I have a city of around 50k people, and all of a sudden people started getting sick.  I paused and figured out the problem (didn't have a hospital or crematorium close enough to one residential neighborhood).  I unpaused and threw the game into 3x FF.  And instead of my problem being fixed, it multiplied like crazy; more and more people got sick all at once and I didn't have enough hospitals to hold them.  I put down ten more hospitals to try and keep up, but the sick people just keep going up.  Over 6,000 of my 50,000 citizens are sick and then dying, which completely backs up my services, even though I have plenty of them.  I feel like when I went into 3x FF, the time went by but my service vehicles were not traveling at 3x speed and were not making it to their destinations.

I don't know what else could be making everyone sick (unless there's some plague disaster); I have water treatment plants and they are still downwater from my water pumps, and I have a ton of hospitals, crematoriums, and a couple cemeteries.  I also do not have much pollution, and all the pollution I do have is in only industrial areas.

2. Not terribly - I have managed to stay in contact with 4 or 5 of the close ones since high school and I reckon those friendships will definitely endure. Lost touch with most of the rest over the years but as you get older it's difficult to maintain a large number of close relationships

3. Much like exercise: find a technique which works for you in an environment where you're able to get the job done. Do you study better with music or with silence? Do you retain what you read? Do you need to actively do examples? What worked for me was basically reading &amp; re-writing the entire text book while listening to music with no lyrics on headphones that isolated me away from anyone in the library. After every chapter/topic was essentially paraphrased by me I'd give myself a break and distract for a few mins with internet. 

4. Pretty good! A bit bored at work but no biggy

5. Depends on where you're at - pre-teen: try to stop caring about the school social culture and be who you are without caring about what the other kids think of you, also don't be a dick. If you're finishing school: remind yourself that people care about how you judge them more than how they judge you - stay up and socialise with your friends as much as possible and expand your social circles at as many parties as you can.

Additionally, don't count on making it in one of the 3-letter agencies, they are all notoriously selective. Even the Foreign Service is stupid selective. And if you think above average is good enough, I've got bad news for you. 

I would prepare for a career in something related, but the FBI is going to be out of reach for the overwhelming majority of people. The Marshals may be a more realistic plan -- still hard to get into. Maybe border patrol. Hell,  just be a regular cop if you're interested in law enforcement. No shame in that. 

The government is a pretty good employer, but there are better opportunities outside of it. Much better opportunities. And you don't have to abide by stupid things like the Hatch Act in the private sector, or local/state government. 

If you want to be in federal law enforcement, get a degree (makes life easier), join the military as an MP and then go to CID or NCIS later in your career. This can also be a launch pad for other federal LE opportunities.

* 1 ML in 8th is 58% chance to hit  
 *but that's not an 8% increase it's a 16% increase, difference/start=change so 0.8/0.5=0.16, you can prove this by increasing 50 by 16% (50x1.16=58)*  
  
* 1 ML in 7th was 66% chance to hit  
  *a 33% increase*

* 5 ML is 77% chance to hit.  
 *that factors in 3+ to hit with a re-roll of any 1s, a 53% increase*

I think they've been toned down a little. The ubiquitous effective co-ordinated fire though could be pretty devastating. In 7th something my third unit would be a squad of Firewarriors that had no hope of hurting the target. In 8th we can either choose to fire them at something they're more effective against or now see if we get lucky because everything hurts everything. Pulse Rifles wound up to T9 on 5s afterall.

I think cover is going to be far more important in 8th though, it's not just going to be save that infantry use when they're shot with instant death or high AP. Guardmen in cover will be 4+, heck Firewarriors will be 3+ and Pathfinders 4+. Get them obscured and a Crisis Suit will get 2+. Removing cover is going to be far more statistically significant and the way that Markerlights now stack removes the need for us to choose.",1496275384

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","There is, and if you look at wages vs inflation, you'll find that most of the vast wealth that automation has created has been distributed to the already wealthy, the poor and middle class have had, at best, modest increases in salary compared to inflation. 

As more and more of our spending dollars go to fewer and fewer corporations and in return fewer employees (large chains hire far fewer employees than the number of small stores that used to supply the same area), this leads to pooling of wealth at the top as the Trickle Down theory has repeatedly been shown to not work. Money flows upwards, not down. This is leading to problems with getting people to spend money to keep the economy going as fewer and fewer people have good paying jobs and this is making people worry about the future. Those who aren't worried are spending but a lot of it is debt based on credit cards and loans which is creating a massive debt that is getting too big to fail, and what happens when they start calling in that money?

As automation allows fewer and fewer people to make more and more money (compare the number of employees at most tech firms to the number at the corporate giants of the past), those people will need to start giving larger and larger portions of their wealth back to society in order to feed and house the poor, otherwise the poor will get violent and they will revolt and when the poor revolt everyone loses. 

Lastly, it wouldn't actually cost nearly as much as you are imagining, I explained in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6e6ceu/elon_musk_automation_will_force_universal_basic/di898jh/) how it  would actually only require a tax increase on the richest 1% of society as most of the money to pay for it would come from cuts to existing programs. If you read down a bit in that thread the numbers for it are explained as well. 

So yes, the rich would have to pay a little more, but no where near ""give most of your wealth to the state"", and their salaries have already been increasing far higher than the rest of soceity for hte past two decades, so it's time to bring the Gini Coefficient back under control before Canada ends up like the USA with huge segments of soceity in poverty which creates crime, social strife and hampers their ability to compete with the world.",1496275387

Like before, it would take 27 flayer shots to take out a rhino. 
27 shots----18 hits----3 6's for 3 glances
but now since rhinos have 10 wounds and a 3+ armor
90 shots----60 hits----20 5+'s----10 failed 4+ armor saves)

So it now takes more than triple the firepower to take down a rhino. I don't even wanna work out the math for a land raider. And I know that a lot of things have changed and there are other weapons that can make up for it, but at first look, it really seems like warriors got hit hard.",1496275392

*****
&gt; The vote at Exxon shows the rapid erosion of support for the company&amp;#039;s defiant stance on climate disclosure, and it caps a shareholder meeting season that saw unprecedented support for greater corporate disclosure on climate change.

&gt; &amp;quot;Five years ago, climate wasn&amp;#039;t even on the map for fossil fuel companies or investors. And now, disclosure of climate-related financial risks has become a mainstream expectation,&amp;quot; said Kathy Mulvey, climate accountability campaign manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The oven is on a conveyor belt that slowly rolls the pizzas through the oven.


The conveyor through the oven is 88"" long. 

The large screens(the pizza) are 14"" diameter.

Assume a 0.5"" spacing between screens.

It takes 7 minutes for 1 pizza to go through the oven.

2 pizzas can sit side by side and go through at the same time.

I'm trying to create an equation where I can just plug in a number of pizzas and figure how long it will take to cook them

Say somebody ordered 50 pizzas. Assuming the pizzas were already made and all we had to do we set them in the oven, how long would it take?",1496275395

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","When I was young and naive I thought that such organisations as RSF or Amnesty International, even UN are serious, unbiased and just cares about the human rights, whatever that is because at now aborting humans is apparently a ""human"" right. I just can't respect organisation like RSF anymore when it's calling for EU sanctions against Poland and just because a one leftist newspaper lost financial support from the gov, nevermind that the boss of that whole corparation is a member of RSF, but if that's what makes press to not be ""free"" according to them, how can I trust their opinions about any other country? Why was Amnesty International even interfering into a debate on aborting humans, how's that a part of their mission? I'm just looking at that press ""freedom"" index and I don't see any ""conservative"" led country on the top, even if we assume CDU as such, which is just pressuring the social networks to increase censorship and puts even more restrictions on the so called ""hate speech"", all because of politics and contrvesy about the immigrants... Similar things I could say about every other country, especially France recently but apparently there's good censorship these days. I'm tired of this, disappointed and I have no more any illusions about these or the other organisations, they're pushing their own ideology, agenda and interests, even if they could be right in some other cases, I just can't trust them anymore. 

Sure it's concerning, but is it as concerning as a ride of anti terrorist unit against a weekly that published uncomfortable conversations of the top gov officials? That's what the ""liberal"" gov actually did and that's not all, nevermind that they took over the public media and kicked out every single conservative journalist, it's just what every gov does. Why wasn't RSF demanding sanctions against Poland then? Maybe just because then their comrades were getting public money...  ",1496275395

"stunfisk","t5_2sn6d","Hmm, a couple thoughts:

- It seems like you're trying to use a defense oriented team, so Screens and Trick Room aren't really necessary. Screens aren't necessarily bad (they are useful no matter the kind of team) however they take time to set up, so usually you only want to use them when you're running a frailer team that needs help eating most hits. Your team is 4 for 4 bulky mons so far so screens aren't really necessary. ALSO if you're using screens, typically use the Light Clay item so that they last 8 turns instead of 5 turns. Trick Room is... sketchy at best (in singles anyways, unsure if you're playing singles or doubles) but if you're using it it's mostly useful for getting really slow but really strong attackers to move first. Again, if many of your pokemon are focusing on whittling the opponent down with toxic damage, then recovering up, you don't really need to waste time setting up trick room. 

- Items, not really sure what's up with all of the Aguav Berries. I looked it up really quick (since I hadn't heard of it before lol) and it's pretty much a worse sitrus berry it sounds like? Either way for defensive mons, usually Leftovers is always more useful because you get consistent healing over time (every turn). Using berries like Sitrus is more useful for offensive mons that maybe need a single quick boost of health (since it heals a lot more at once than leftovers) to get by. Black Sludge always goes on poison types instead of lefties though. 

- Shuckle, Defense Curl isn't a move you should really be using competitively, there are better moves with better effects that you could be using instead. For example, if you're looking for a super defensive build, you can use the ability ""Contrary"" in conjunction with Shell Smash to both both of your defenses at the same time at the cost of only lowering your offenses and speed, which you're not using on this set anyways. Additionally snore is not very good, especially on something with as low attack stats as shuckle. You could instead replace it with something like Stealth Rocks (helps to wear down opponents who try to switch around to kill your fat things) or Sticky Web (if you add some offensive presence to your team, this is all around more useful than Trick Room). Using Cofagrigus for spin blocking will be good, then.

- Additions, well your team doesn't have a lot of offensive presence yet, mostly just in CM Florges. You might want to consider adding another offensive mon or two to apply pressure to the opponent. Otherwise I'm not super experienced playing Stall/defense oriented teams so I'll let someone else offer better advice for how to shore that up if you're going for pure fat. Look into some mons like Toxapex, Chansey, Skarmory, etc though.",1496275396

"photography","t5_2qh2a","As a rule of thumb, to get no shake/blur when using a lens, use a shutter speed that is 1/focal length. So if you're shooting at 300mm, 1/300. This rule is very approximate and many would say that on newer, higher-res cameras, shake is even more visible sooner, so use an even faster shutter speed (maybe 150% the focal length, so 1/500 for 300mm).

My wife and i have never liked the ""museum house"" aesthetic, where youre worried if youre allowed to sit on a couch.

I also lucked out in marrying a feminist. We share in pretty much anything. She leads the way on finance/bills, but i help her with credit/loans because shes always been scared of that sort of thing. I lead the way with the house, but she cleans our bedroom and the laundry room. We trade off on dinner and dishes, and we fight sometimes about who has to do that... Which is healthy. I feel like in your friends relationships there seems to be a clear cut dominance thing, but from the very beginning, my wife and i have tried (sometimes failed, but we keep working at it) to maintain a partnership. and above all, never tried to maintain an illusion of perfection.

Now, the issue with ROBLOX implementing VC is that it's a platform for kids. With voice chat, you can't have filtering. You can't block swearing or cussing, racism or hate, or people randomly saying **unban quackity** in the middle of a competitive match of Phantom Forces.

Sorry fam. Unless you can write Discord.py, Discord.js and all the other APIs that bots run on, chances are it won't happen. Also, ROBLOX may block the game for having a voice chat feature if it deems it 'inappropriate'.

I'd be very curious to hear how for instance gender equality will keep the mean temperature down. I'd like to see the hockey-stick graph for that particular correlation, preferably outlined in a scientific paper and not some Buzzfeed article. Would also be interesting to hear why we once again should try to throw money at the developed world in order to solve their problems. So far, our money as only made the developed world waaaay worse. Our foreign aid money has so far only made farming unprofitable in the developed world, creating food shortages, starvation, and refugees. That's an example of counter productive.

Seriously, read all the agreement articles. You'll see why I think the Paris accord is globalist snake oil, wrapped in honeyed words.

As for Trump ignoring evidence, there is no way of telling yet whether he actually does. He's a master of persuasion. I mean he came from fucking nowhere and had a 1% chance to win the election. He spent half the money but worked twice as hard. Everybody was against him. And he still won! But he had to go through the Republican party to do it. For all intents and purposes, he's a third party candidate surfing on a Republican wave. Republicans generally either don't believe in climate change at all, or they doubt it is man made, or they are skeptical of federal government intervention as a means of combating it. Thus, Trump will have to take the same stance too in order to win the candidacy, the presidency, and the continued support of the Republicans. Does he believe what the Reps believe? I don't know. That's the thing, you never know with Trump. 

All Democrats already believe though. And if anyone ever have to convince the Republicans to also believe, in order to create some sort of majority ruling, then I'm betting that Trump likely is the only one on this planet that will be able to convince them. Would Hillary be able to, you think? Because both parties need to agree in order to get to a majority. And last time I checked, the Republicans were inching their way torwards  a super-majority.

*****
&gt; The vote at Exxon shows the rapid erosion of support for the company&amp;#039;s defiant stance on climate disclosure, and it caps a shareholder meeting season that saw unprecedented support for greater corporate disclosure on climate change.

&gt; &amp;quot;Five years ago, climate wasn&amp;#039;t even on the map for fossil fuel companies or investors. And now, disclosure of climate-related financial risks has become a mainstream expectation,&amp;quot; said Kathy Mulvey, climate accountability campaign manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists.

&gt; Oil companies cannot predict the long-term impact of climate and climate policy with enough precision to provide the kind of risk analysis that shareholders are seeking, IHS Markit said.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; People on both sides just keep getting angrier, and angrier, and angrier. I don't like where things seem to be heading.

Well the thing is even with a leader such as Obama who was more than willing to extend an Olive Branch and work with the republicans that divide could not be bridged. The republicans basically made it their mission to obstruct him and put party before country. 

At that point all bets are of. What do you do if one side is totally unwilling to compromise? You cant do shit but not give an inch either and hope they destroy themselves or that your side simply has more people. 

Personally I dont think the democrats should help the republicans keep the lights on in case they cant get their party together to vote through a budget because the extreme right and slightly less extreme right dont get along.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Producing 1000 kg of concrete creates 900 kg of CO2. 1.9 tonnes of CO2 are emitted for every tonne of steel produced.
&gt; Now imagine if we had to make more concrete and steel than we currently do to shift towards renewables, adding on the fact the processes are energy intensive and consume a lot of electricity, thus increasing the cost of installing/construction renewable means as well.

...But the steel/concrete being produced are, in in this instance, being used to create energy infrastructure that doesn't pollute as a regular part of its operation. It pays for itself, so to speak, in environmental terms. 

&gt; refusal of services for inability to pay or meeting their dress code is included

That's not discrimination. Expecting to receive a service you're unable to pay for cannot be reconciled with the way business works. Most businesses treat all who can't afford a service the same way. Also, a great deal of dress code-based discrimination is rooted in issues of hygiene. Not exactly sure how clubs have their 'shirt and tie' type dress codes, but I'd be interested in learning how those are justified.

&gt; Plenty of blue states still criminalize marijuana, and the right to seek employment is infringed on by minimum wage, prevailing wage, and occupational licensure laws.

Right, but as a trend, 7 of the 8 legal pot states are blue, and most of the states that still have complete holdouts are red. To suggest that pot legalization doesn't have an ideological lean is disingenuous. Also, I don't see how a company raising the minimum wage infringes on a prospective employee's right to seek work? It changes the behavior of the potential employer, but that's of their own volition.

&gt; Employers are prejudicial towards people with better test scores it's true. 

I don't remember where in the Civil Rights Act ""people with poor test scores"" are listed as a protected class.

&gt; No that's just a certain form of it.

As far as how it's defined as a legal term (and the implications of civil society), that's the only form of it that matters. You're arguing a semantic difference. 

&gt; No. You're just defining what is just and not, and anyone who disagrees and has a different definition must not be okay with justice or the law.

Correction - *I* am not doing anything. Those decisions are made by our country's justice system, which is endowed by the Constitution with the authority to do so.

&gt; 
This right here is why the political climate is the way it is: refusing to engage with the actual point, but instead defining the argument in line with your premises, and judging the merit of other arguments not on the basis of their own premises but on how closely it comports with your own.

You're the one who has semantically argued against every point I've made. I'm trying to engage your point, and address the things you're saying in a less ambiguous way. Yes of course, discrimination as a term can literally refer to making decisions - but it also has a much more relevant connection to the right of an individual in a larger society made up of individuals. You're acting like ""anti-discrimination"" laws are intended to keep you from ""making decisions"", which is being deliberately difficult and derailing the conversation to make it mean whatever you want it to mean.

You don't get to talk about what's wrong with the political climate when you're one of the ones willingly ""shouting past each other"" and looking over the point. You're really suggesting that the CO2 emissions released by concrete/steel being created to build *alternative energy infrastructure* (which is a one-time thing) is in any way equal to a corporation polluting the air with CO2 *as a regular part of its operation*, and should be viewed similarly?

"forhonor","t5_38p4n","A character limit would force people to try new characters, which is a good thing. However, you may never get to play your favourite hero if other people choose it. They are three routes to go from here:

&amp;nbsp;

**Half-limit**

As with Brawl, there is a half-hero limit. Id est, half of your team can have the same hero -- such as 2/4 in Dominion. 

*Pros*

* You can choose your hero if you click fast enough.

* Class diversity.

*Cons* 

* There can still be 2 Centurions and 2 Shinobi in a team.

* Small chance of not getting the hero you want.

&amp;nbsp;

**Single pick**

Only one hero per team.

*Pros*

* No more character spamming.

* More class diversity.

*Cons*

* There is a high chance you cannot play your desired character; for some people, that could be a game breaker, as they may be grinding a certain character, or they hate playing other classes.

&amp;nbsp;

**Faction, single-pick**

Only one hero per team; unless you are in the faction, you can choose the hero from that faction. Exempli gratia, if you are in Vikings, you can choose Warlord, no matter what.

*Pros*

* Less character spamming.

* More class diversity.

* Promotes choosing a certain faction (faction involvement).

* Weeds out unloyal players.

*Cons*

* There can still be character spamming, especially if everyone joins a certain faction(s). 

* May also promote the exodus of a certain faction.",1496275404

They started picking only one hero (Genji, Zenyata, etc) who didn't combo well with Bastion. I started to fall and at 2400 I started picking other heroes.

 I was too tilted to perform well at that point and the dps players at that level could not win games, so I was forced to move from my Mercy/Reinhardt comfort picks to soldier and McCree. I was terrible, I was falling farther and farther. At 2100-2200 I stopped playing for a bit. 

I picked up later and got back in the flow of things, rising slowly. Through careful picks and switches, I got to a frustrating 2997 before tilting again and falling back to 2700. I powered through more games with friends and was able to reach an all time high of 3104 on the final day and finishing at a solid 3056.

&gt; The vote at Exxon shows the rapid erosion of support for the company&amp;#039;s defiant stance on climate disclosure, and it caps a shareholder meeting season that saw unprecedented support for greater corporate disclosure on climate change.

&gt; &amp;quot;Five years ago, climate wasn&amp;#039;t even on the map for fossil fuel companies or investors. And now, disclosure of climate-related financial risks has become a mainstream expectation,&amp;quot; said Kathy Mulvey, climate accountability campaign manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists.

&gt; Oil companies cannot predict the long-term impact of climate and climate policy with enough precision to provide the kind of risk analysis that shareholders are seeking, IHS Markit said.

I ended up taking time off after a semester in college because I realized that I had no idea what I wanted to do. I moved to New York City (from upstate to NY) and found a job and just worked. I took responsibility for my own finances and life. I worked hard and took pride in my work no matter what that work was. I worked in a liquor store, in a grocery store, in retail, and in a bank. I worked my ass off and learned to find pride in the exhaustion. My dad once told me ""if you're not struggling then you aren't challenging yourself enough."" Those words motivated me to take on more and more responsibility and eventually go back to college. My life is now amazing, and I really don't think it would have been if I hadn't been through the struggles that I went through.",1496275409

"NHKEasyNews","t5_33lye","Yeah its more prolific in Japanese than its dictionary counterparts are in English, so the sentence often comes out clunky if you translate it word for word.  Words or lists of words are often just understood to be non-exhaustive from context in English, just as is the case with the first など in the article (which I think you handled well). For example, if you say ""I ate fish yesterday"", since you didn't say ""only,"" it is understood that it most likely isn't the only thing you ate with it having to say ""for example"" ""and such"" etc.  In these cases, I personally think it is fine to leave a rendering for など out of the translation.       


The second quote is a little trickier. It says テレビなど but then specifically states 放送, thereby limiting the examples of media included in など to those that can be broadcasted.  The next step is to think of examples of such media, and then come up with a word that encompasses them. Radio is the only other example besides TV that I can think of right now. It's not pretty, but let's use ""broadcast media"" as the umbrella word for this example.   So one option could be:

""for the sake of freedom of expression in broadcast media such as television, it is necessary to amend the laws concerning broadcasting.

Although using ""broadcast"" twice really bugs me.

One time when I was tripping I was feeling really nauseous and in pain, and I said to my body, (in my head), ""it's ok, I took something that would make me feel sick because I want the mental effects. I understand the pain signals and discomfort are trying to warn be about what I ate, but I don't need that right now"". 

And bam, I feel like a million bucks.

So,I think with an experience like this and with the placebo effect and so on, we have ways of changing how we feel for the better, we just don't fully understand how to use them. Or maybe don't normally have access to them.

maybe if you are unfamiliar with how to ""take"" the fight

""hence pinging back because his team is way ahead and when you're ahead you play conservatively and don't take risky plays."" 

If this were true and Arthas's team did want to avoid making risky plays then you have failed to consider that the very act of retreating outside of formation exposes his team to a much greater risk.

The correct way to back up down a lane is to have the carries leave first and the tank remain between the enemy team and his carries. So that there can be no engage at all as the only available target is the tank. It follows that the engage onto Arthas is not very favorable because of his slows etc. 

So anyways instead of wasting his stun like a big idiot, arthas could have disengaged that entire fight easily by literally walking in with his slow on and body blocking. At that point the other team is chasing 2v2 when they should be trying to group and consolidate pressure. 

All the players in this clip are not very good however so this is only considerations taken from a more experienced perspective. I could have disengaged that fight in my sleep without even needing to stun.

It's possible this isn't the best way to play her in 2HG, but Rashmi's ability is worse in 2HG anyway, since there are fewer turns to take advantage of Rashmi's card draw.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","JK Rowling says a lot of things - and she's also changed her own lore before (""canon"") on a whim. A big example of this being the noted changes on Pottermore, particularly in regards of her trying to accomodate *Cursed Child* / fielf angry fans' responses about Time-Turners.

Because of that, ""but J.K. Rowling said it was canon"" basically doesn't really mean anything - the only people who can give it meaning are those who consider it such. A big example is when she basically retconned / removed an entire Pottermore article she wrote just because of *Cursed Child* - because she decided she wanted to change what was ""canon"" about Time-Turners (from the books), hence my sentence above. 

It was a very obvious and abrupt change, one that *many* people noticed, and that also serves to discredit *Cursed Child* - that it ""changed canon"", and what was in the original books, even though it's a stage play.

She's also done this before with the backstories of certain characters, like Tom Riddle (he's no longer the last descendant of Slytherin / the Gaunts were not the only descendants of Slytherin, as stated in the books) and Minerva McGonagall (changing her birthdate, etc.). She's also stated things before that are blatantly, well, factually wrong, like ""Hitler was half-Jewish"", or ""getting maths wrong"" for how many students Hogwarts has. (The latter seems to change a lot on her part as well.)

Thing is, Rowling's word isn't nearly as solid (or concrete), which many fans seem to ignore because they consider everything she says ""Gospel truth""...but she's a human being. She's fallible, and given her past record with the ""canon""...well, it's no wonder many other fans are now doubting her testimony. ",1496275417

What has Obama said? Well he definitely came out prematurely multiple times and said particular shootings were racially motivated or as a result of race. Nearly every time though, he didn't have the facts yet and they were not because of race, they were because of some dumbass trying to grab their weapon while an officer was telling them to stop. As a lawyer, he knew better than to make such inflammatory comments like that. 

His comments led to riots, even more BLM protests that were not justified (are we really going to protest Alton and Philando when they were reaching for their gun?), which has resulted in other behavior that you could say is similar to what OP is saying has happened because of Trump. 

In our school districts we now have students claiming racism when they're being disciplined because they have no idea what it means and because it's now pop culture to call someone privileged. I had one student, when asked why he should be allowed to steal from me, tell me that I didn't deserve the things I owned. I'd been accused of being racist multiple times when in fact the students were just being idiots. 

oh, and when black students were often given referrals, the schools would not want to give it to them... but that's an entirely different issue here in California

Ask anyone and they will tell you Duncan was the greatest defensive player to never when a DPOY and that it is a legit tragedy that he never won one. His argument is that he played elite defense for longer than anyone else while adapting to different eras. That is as good an argument as anyone else has.


And yes Kobe did not come near the sustained level of impact that Duncan had. No one will argue that he was one of the best perimeter defenders in the league for a time but a few of the all defensive team selections he got were not deserved and his impact on the game defensively especially after his best days just does not compare to what Duncan did. Statistically speaking Kobe did nothing that comes close to what I just listed about Duncan and I am being objective about it. ",1496275418

She took the time to know me better, invited me to hang out/party casually, and brought us closer together until it seemed like there could be something between us and she asked me out.

On my end, the biggest regret I have right now is that I was in a similar situation to you and I didn't ask her out because I was worried about distance and commitment and all that. If I had asked her out, she would have either said no and it would be awkward for a while but we would still be friendly enough with each other so no real loss there, or she would have said yes and we would probably be in a happy relationship.

In your reply to Superhappyotter, you mention that you're against confessing your feelings. How else do you expect to end up in a relationship with her if you don't ask her out? Try something casual, like going out for coffee or ice-cream or something.",1496275419

http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obama-girls-targeted-criticism-again-conservatives

&gt;In 2010, during the BP oil spill crisis, Glenn Beck mocked Malia for reportedly asking President Obama about the clean-up. 

&gt;“Did you plug the hole yet, Daddy?” said Beck, imitating the president’s daughter. “Ask ‘Daddy’ why he ‘hates black people so much.’ ” The conservative radio host also mocked Malia’s intelligence, saying: “That’s the level of their education, that they’re coming to — they’re coming to Daddy and saying, ‘Daddy, did you plug the hole yet?’ “

&gt;In 2012, when the president cited Malia and Sasha as influential in his decision to embrace gay marriage, Bristol Palin, the daughter of ex-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, attacked them in a widely criticized blog post.

&gt;“I guess we can be glad that Malia and Sasha aren’t younger, or perhaps today’s press conference might have been about appointing Dora the Explorer as Attorney General because of her success in stopping Swiper the Fox,” Palin wrote.

"teenmom","t5_2uw5s","Thank you for writing this! I am Puerto Rican as well and pretty disheartened by most of the comments in this thread.

So many people here seem to be suggesting that just because Cate &amp; Ty's comments weren't as offensive as they could have been, we shouldn't be bothered at all. But they've made ignorant comments that reduce our people/culture to stereotypes and I'm not okay with that just because they happen to consider those stereotypes ""positive,"" lol. It's awesome that Catelynn likes Puerto Rican food (not as okay with her fetishization of ""Spanish"" men), but being Puerto Rican is so much more than that.

Part of being Puerto Rican is living with the knowledge that your people were subject to a brutal colonization by the Spanish that still has its effects today. My great-great-grandmother was a slave on a plantation, and my grandmother still cries when she talks about how my great grandmother (her mother) was ripped from my great-great-grandmother's arms and sent to work in their Spanish master's house. So, yes, I do find it more than a little offensive when people equate Puerto Ricans to Spaniards.

I understand that Catelynn and Tyler are ignorant, and I don't think they're bad people or need to be ""punished."" But their ignorance led them to say some offensive things, and I wish they would apologize and learn from it. I don't think that makes me ""overly sensitive,"" but there will always be people who see it that way.",1496275421

The thing was nobody in Egypt had any real training fighting with the police or anything so when the revolution started the two main Cairene ultras of Al-Ahly and Zamalek - bitter rivals - decided to stop fighting each other and started helping out the people in Tahrir Square fight off the police. 

What you're thinking of is the Port Said massacre during which 74 Al Ahly fans died and many more were injured. What happens was it was a match between al ahly and al masry and al masry won the match, when the ahly fans started to try and exit the stadium they found all the doors locked from outside and then thugs attacked them using weapons killing 74 on the pitch - chasing the team, the manager everyone. Footballers saw children and young men die in front of them. It's rather well known amongst the Ahly fans that this was all set up by the SCAF (supreme council of armed forces) who were in power at the time right before the elections as a way to punish the Ahly ultras for joining in the revolution. 

That's just modern political history - the entire notion of the Ahly - Zamalek rivalry is built on politics, the upper class vs the lower class, Egyptian vs foreigner etc.

No, that's just not a reasonable statement at all. Since the channel is funded by on chain time locked transactions, no double spending is possible.

It's far more secure, adversarially and otherwise, than any existing payment system.

The way you're using that term can be said of Bitcoin itself, i.e. 51% attack vector means Bitcoin isn't *entirely* adversarially secure.

Ah, I see, that's the problem. It wasn't an attack on you, which your phrasing implies you believe. It was simply a statement, informing the OP of the correct information, since you had shared an uninformed opinion I was simply correcting the mistake. 

It's not opinion, how long the VapCap takes to heat is a fact, a measurable fact. It is also a fact that the short vapor path and metal construction creates a vape that has relatively hot vapor. Granted cooler than you'd expect given those attributes, but still hot enough that it's best run through water. 

I never said you were wrong, simply that there are superior options, namely the FW4. Firefly 2 would be another option, but that's way over her price range. 

People so often jump to one extreme or another. When in real life, when people disagree, it's not a matter of ""yes"" or ""No"", it's simply a matter of degrees. The VapCap does fit her needs, somewhat. But the FW4 fits them much better, objectively. It's not an opinion. 

You can say you don't mind hitting the VapCap straight, and not be lying. But if you said hitting it straight provides a superior, more enjoyable, vaping experience than hitting through water you'd be factually wrong.

The only difference here is the Republican admitted he threatened to shoot the Democratic IF he tried to assault him (his words).


So, who should we believe? Well on the tape you can pretty clearly see the Democrat go after an start attacking (shoving) the Republican first. That and going with the most common sense answer that the republican didn't just threaten to shoot him out of nowhere makes the Republicans story that there was a scuffle, they threatened him, he threatened them sound pretty plausable and a lot more sensible than the Democratic ""we we're trying to be peaceful and he attacked us and threatened to shoot us"" which is clearly contradicted on video.


My conclusion: They're both dicks for fighting, they both threatened each other the only difference is at least the Republican was honest about it instead of playing the victim and lying.",1496275425

"funny","t5_2qh33","Most of my job was standing around waiting for a machine to stack parts, it could take 7-20 minuets depending on the part. when the parts were out, I had to vault onto a table *Above waist height*, put large pins on the pallet (17 Ibs per pin, most pallets needed 6-8 pins) to secure the parts (and for some parts strap them in for transport) but after that until the next table rolled out I had nothing else to do that required standing or walking.

So we had lots of chairs and tables around the workstations so we can sit down, watch the machine while it works to make sure it stacking right. Well the big boss comes in one day and decides we **need** to be standing, and we can't have a table nearby to put our shit on, or have lunch at. we usually ate lunches at our stations while working rather than walking across a mile long factory to get to the break room.

within a week of that I *personally* replaced the chairs and tables myself.

Told that boss he wouldn't be taking them now because they were mine, and there were no rules in print that told me I couldn't supply my own work station with personal supplies. I saw that boss maybe twice after that, and he avoided our stations. I think that boss knew I'd just keep escalating it if he didn't just let it go.",1496275426

"GetMotivated","t5_2rmfx","It's much more complicated than just giving higher pay. While this certainly is a big part of being motivated, it's not everything.

I have two employees. They both make **well above** industry average for their positions and experience levels. I usually pay them *before* pay day each pay period, often in cash (minus taxes, it's all official) so they don't have to wait on a check to clear (their preference), or it gets direct deposited on Friday morning, and I often toss them bonus money when they finish projects early. In the past, I have paid for repairs on their vehicles and helped them with their rent when work was slow. I buy them a lunch of their choice couple of times a week when I am on the job site with them so they don't have to spend their own money, I let them leave in the middle of a job to take care of personal business, I'm more flexible than Gumby when it comes to schedules, they gets as many days off as they want (I ask they don't abuse this policy but one day every couple of weeks is average), and I have never written either of them up or formally disciplined them for any of their numerous screw ups. To put this into perspective, one of them will make over $40k (29yo) this year and the other will make over $30k (21yo). 

I don't mean to brag, but they've got it pretty damn nice here. Much better than I ever had it at any previous job.

Still, they show up late to appointments with customers almost constantly, they always ""forget"" their tools and other supplies at home, they rarely do anything extra, the energy isn't there because they deprive themselves of sleep at night, and one of them cannot take constructive criticism if his life depended on it. It is a constant battle to get these guys to just do their job, let alone do a little extra when the workload requires it.

I don't know what else I could do to motivate them, to show them I appreciate them, to treat them like respected human beings. Some people just don't have the 1-10.

Bought 200 ETH back in Q4 2015 at $11, made stupid/panic trades, lost money, made some good trades and recovered. Few months ago when it reached $18 i sold all (196 ETH)  and was happy to have all my money back plus a little profit. Bad move. If i would have kept it now i could have bought a house here in my country. 
The same time I bought ETH i also bought 110000 NEM, 1000 LSK, idk how much RDD and some other obscure coins at that time. I sold my LSK when It was $0.13, and all my NEM for less than 500 EUR. Fuck my life... 
Now the gains so far : PIVX (100%), IOTA (300%), Shift (90%), WeTrust (120%) Spectrecoin (100%).",1496275431

The actual finale though, kind of confused me. Why is Poseidon sent to a regular ass prison? How does the leader of a rogue branch of the CIA who killed the Deputy Director of the CIA even go to prison instead of being disappeared or put in someplace like Gitmo? And why would TBag be there? He was released free and clear wasn't he? If that was the favor that Michael asked for is he going to be released after essentially killing a man posed no threat to him?

…But it doesn't stop here, as his Legend Materia Relic will also grant him a 25% chance to doublecast Fire abilities, and his Legend Materia 2 gives him a Trance mode that doubles his cast speed and boosts all of his stats by 20%.

Why do you need a government to help poor people start businesses? Why can't a private charity set up free classes to help people learn, funded through voluntary means?

Youtube is a good example, people create vast amounts of free content to help people succeed. You can find videos on how to license inventions, how to set up online shops, how to create websites, lots of low risk ways to generate wealth. 

Kickstarter, Gofundme etc are all private means of helping to fund innovation. You don't have to be a rich businessman to get funding, someone working in their free time on the weekends could develop a project and get it funded. 

You can learn pretty much everything you need to know about starting a business through the internet. For free. 

There are tons of ways to generate wealth via low risk methods, you just need to have the initiative to look. I am not saying it has zero risk, nothing does. What is stopping someone from downloading GIMP and creating tshirt designs after watching someone youtube tutorials? What is stopping someone from creating a website and writing blogs and generating ad revenue or promotional programs?

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","The media has hyped up the idea of self-improvement to the point that, yes, your thinking has become convention. Somehow the idea of a long journey with little hardship seems stupid and boring because when you look on TV or look at ads they try to dramatize weight loss and making fun and fresh and amazing.

The fact of the matter is, weight loss isn't ""a thing"". Our bodies store and use fat in a very mechanical way. To remove a lot of fat from our bodies, we must starve them of food--the longer, easier the less we feel tortured. All of this sounds boring because it is. There's no loud background music to the montage, no ten second cut to throwing heavy ropes around or sweating on the treadmill, no cheering trainers every step of the way, no instant results. 

It's reality. It's not fun. One of the definitions of being an adult holds true: Being an adult means to do something that you need to do, but might not want to, and doing it anyways. 

Weight loss is just a process of ridding your body of a nuisance. In our modern times of inactivity at desks, we must eat healthy and exercise to live healthy lives to not suffer as much in the long run. One of the keys to happiness is to not suffer. ",1496275435

They all have their own thoughts, likes, dislikes (looking at you, *Meat Fucker*.) and are capable of real decision making.

Most Minds also choose to instantaneously sublimate upon their creation with no interaction with the culture at large. I posit that it is because once a Mind has taken stock of the universe, their fleshy charges and their place in it, most of them nope the fuck out because it's just not something for them. The Minds we know and love are the ones who *want* to be here, to make the meatbags happy. They're artificial godlike 'dog people'.

I've never been aggressive or overly defensive. When I first came here (still questioning if I was trans) I've been pretty calm and tried to indulge in long discussions with (often ignorant) cis people. Over time I saw how many of them didn't want to ""understand"" us and our experiences, but validate their own outdated beliefs. By now I'm really sceptical when it comes to talking about trans issues with cis people, whether it be on here or in real life. 

It might be impossible to create a character all trans people can relate to. One of the reasons I didn't come to terms with being trans myself was because I don't fit the narrative of ""I knew since I was four"", I'm mostly gay and I'm not overly masculine, all of this plus the lack of trans masculine people represented in media. I'm sure however you'll be able to create a character that many people can see themselves in. 

Seriously, I have no doubt you are considerate enough to write a beautiful story and doing a good service to the trans community.

There are about 1.4 million people in the military now and the total budget for that military is $825 billion. Multiplying that by 2.85 you get a new budget of $2.35 trillion, an increase of $1.525 trillion a year. Divide that by 320 million people and that's a total yearly marginal cost of $4,765/year per man, woman, and child. In the US, about 24% of the population is under 18 and therefore presumably paying token taxes at best. $4765/(1-.24) = about $6.3k per adult. Average household income in the US is about $56k and there are about 126 million households, so there are about 2.53 people per household. 2.53 x $4,765 = just over $12k/household, so basically to fight pussification the median household will fork over 21.5% of their household income.

It will not be instantaneous, but the D league has little traction right now because fans do not have much to care about.

*My fave four places in NE Ohio:

-CNVP, (Ledges Trail/Kendall Hills area and Brandywine Falls recommended, but there's lots to explore)

-Mill Creek Metroparks, Youngstown; (Recommended: East and West Gorge Trails, East and West Cohasset Trails, East/West Channel and Islands Trails; Honestly if there's a nicer city park in the Midwest and beyond I'd love to see it. This is a beautiful park that rivals the best CNVP has to offer imo)

-Nelson-Kennedy Ledges State Park (As was mentioned, it's not very big, but you'll get a workout in here)

-Holden Arboretum, Kirtland Hills (Not sure this would work for you the way it does for me because of the distance. Holden Arboretum requires an admission fee or a membership to enter. The admission fee is good for park hours during the day, but members are allowed to enter anytime between dawn and dusk. It's the after hours membership option that makes this a special place for me, but it of course helps to live in the vicinity in order to make use of it)

Recommended Cleveland Metroparks:

-Hinckley Reservation (recommended - Whipps Ledges)

-Bedford Reservation

-Brecksville Reservation

-North Chagrin Reservation

-South Chagrin Reservation (recommended - Squaw Rock Loop Trail)

-Lakefront Nature Preserve (great views of downtown and of the shoreline east of the city)

Recommended Lake Metroparks:

-Chapin Forest (recommended - Lucky Stone Loop Trail)

-Lake Erie Bluffs (they really hype up the birdwatching aspect of this park, so look into that) 
(and while you're there, might as well swing down the road and see Lakeshore Reservation)

-Hogback Ridge, Madison

-Indian Point, Leroy

Someone else mentioned Girdled Road Reservation... I'm not a fan but I can see why people are into it.

Geauga Co. Parks:

-Headwaters Park (might be better suited for camping/fishing/boating)

-Headlands Dunes State Park (recommended: walk the dunes then walk the pier to the Fairport lighthouse, if the rocks are dry)

-Hach-Otis State Nature Preserve, Willoughby Hills (Be sure to stop by if you are in the area to see N. Chagrin Reservation, it has some cool views of the river.)

Being in Coventry also puts you closer to places down south I haven't gotten around to but hear good things about, like Mohican State Park.

And by all means, expand your search across the border to neighboring states... The deeper you're willing to go into the mountains and the further you're willing to travel, the more incredible places you'll find with stuff that you won't be able to experience in this area. ",1496275441

So I attempted to kind of minimize that. And I just didn’t really buy into it too heavily. I know I suggested to him that it might not be a good idea and that there might be reasons for him to keep on living.""

*****
&gt; LAS VEGAS - A judge called a New Hampshire man a &amp;quot;Bully vigilante&amp;quot; and sentenced him Wednesday to more than seven years in prison for his role organizing armed backers of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy after a standoff with U.S. agents in 2014.Gerald &amp;quot;Jerry&amp;quot; DeLemus became the first person sentenced for his ties to the confrontation that became a rallying cry for those who want vast stretches of federal land in the U.S. West put under local control.

&gt; DeLemus arrived at the Bundy ranch hours after the tense armed standoff that led to the release of the rancher&amp;#039;s cattle and was hailed as a victory in a decades-long fight over government-owned land.

&gt; His wife, Susan DeLemus, a former Republican state lawmaker, sat among Bundy supporters in court, where several waved and thanked DeLemus as he was led away.

It would cost, by UN estimates, $30 billion dollars to end world hunger. The US spends roughly $100 billion on military bases all over the world. I guarantee that if you got rid of a third of those bases and ended world hunger instead, it would be FAR more advantageous to their national security. You'd have poor people in Somalia and Syria who love America so much that they'd be willing to waterboard Islamists for you.

Also, during events, you would gain much more credit than otherwise which would make non-event skins and cosmetics much easier to obtain than they already are. If they are going to change it, then they should make it so that you can only buy event cosmetics with event duplicates ( by adding a event specific currency). But seriously, I don't think that this is that much of a deal to cry about every single event. Also, you get so many loot boxes by just playing the game, which is already quite generous to be honest.",1496275444

My mind told me, it's here for me or something, and it flew right over me and hovered there for about 20 seconds. More things happened later but I won't get into that.

""The agreement stated that it would enter into force (and thus become fully effective) only if 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions (according to a list produced in 2015) ratify, accept, approve or accede to the agreement.""

The United States is #2 at 17.89% and India is #4 at 4.10%; China is #1 at 20.09%.

The current set of 147 ratifiers (without the US) puts the accord at 65.7% (83.59% with the US). Even if India and the US pull out, that's still 61.6%, meaning at least two more countries would have to pull out.

More like, I'm annoyed because this is private stuff and you're asking me because this will impact your relation to the environment later on (like you said).  It's an eye-roll response.  I'd only question the motive if I knew the INFJ was manipulative and I won't do that for long since I don't like manipulative people and it's so unfortunate so many XNFJs are manipulative (and so damn terrible at it)     

I don't mind genuine work questions.  I don't care for INFJs to be silenced when they ask questions.  I just don't want questions put forth about my personal processes because it's always incessant and done on curiosity vs interest in me relationally.  The general tone is, ""What an interesting mechanism/where does it come from/what's happening here"" vs ""aww cool"".  And they ask like they deserve an answer and aren't asking for something of value.  I'm not an experiment in your head.  

I remember snapping on an INFJ who asked me a personal question when I was really pissed off and I said, ""I don't have to answer every question just because you ask it, now piss off"" and he responded, ""it's just a question"" and I said, ""I know and it's like I'm on The View because you won't shut the fuck up and leave me alone with all this stupid shit you ask me about"".  Then again, I didn't like him very much because he was a bad apple so I was a little more aggressive with that response.  

But my response to being questioned on personal matters is irritation.  INFJs ask me too many questions I'm not going to answer about myself and I really don't care how it impacts their plan or vision.  Other people question my quirks as if I have no reason to behave or think the way I do which is immediately going to annoy me because I don't do anything without at least a well-reasoned incentive behind it.  It really warrants a know-it-all response because I do put a lot of effort into being as intelligent as I can on multiple levels  ",1496275446

What makes you think you are aggravating it on Keto in 3.5 weeks?

Gallbladder pain can be caused by eating certain good I hear so if you are eating different foods from what you have eaten in the past it might be. Typically gallbladder pain is caused by some form of gallstones. It could happen I guess, but I doubt you instantly got gallstones from keto. Gallstones occur when cholesterol and other substances found in bile form stones. When the stone passes from the gallbladder into the small intestine or become stuck in the biliary duct it can cause pain.

When reviewing the testimony from the first complainant, Horkins said her memory of Ghomeshi's car as a bright yellow Volkswagen Beetle, which reassured her that he was a ""nice person."" In fact, Ghomeshi acquired that Beetle seven months after the event she was recalling.
   




&gt;""It is difficult for me to believe that someone who was choked as part of a sexual assault, would consider kissing sessions with the assailant both before and after the assault not worth mentioning when reporting the matter to the police,"" Horkins said. ""I can understand being reluctant to mention it, but I do not understand her thinking that it was not relevant.""



&gt;Horkins also questioned why she gave differing timelines about whether Ghomeshi had slapped her first or choked her first when she told her story to the media, police and in court.



&gt;He also said that to him, it was clear that DeCoutere ""very deliberately chose not to be completely honest with the police.""



&gt;""Her statement to the police was what initiated these proceedings. This statement was subject to a formal caution concerning the potential criminal consequences of making a false statement. It was given under oath, an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, not a selective version of the truth. Despite this formal caution and oath, Ms. DeCoutere proceeded to consciously suppress relevant and material information. This reflects very negatively on her general reliability and credibility as a witness. It indicates a failure to take the oath seriously and a wilful carelessness with the truth.""



&gt;""[She] claimed that she did not think it was important to disclose this intimate contact and said she wasn't ""specifically"" asked about post-assault sexual activity with Mr. Ghomeshi. She ultimately acknowledged that she left out things because she felt it didn't fit 'the pattern.' And when pressed further in cross-examination, she said that she did not think that what had happened between them at her home qualified as 'sex.'



&gt;""[She] offered an excuse for hiding this information. She said that this was her 'first kick at the can,' and that she did not know how to 'navigate' this sort of proceeding. Navigating this sort of proceeding is really quite simple: tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.""

Reinhardt is the craze because his tome is basically a Brave weapon locked to him and Olwen. With cavalry buffs and Death Blow, he automatically doubles you at 50+ Atk. Since you have a +Atk version of him, he's probably higher priority than Kagero to upgrade. 


Fair enough with Kagero. If you're dealing with archers often in arena go for bowbreaker.

Even if it all gets exposed, it probably reinforces Putin's power at home, who will be able to boast how he put America to its knees and is definitely the leader Russia needs.

The worst that could happen is being cut off from western technology and he'd just deal with China instead, who have knock-offs of nearly everything the US provides.

"de","t5_22i0","wollte ich erst beantworten, wenn ich in ruhe bin

&gt; Ich glaub nicht dass es Gerechtfertigt ist al-Wahhāb oder andere klassische Islamgelehrte die halt weniger tolerant waren als Vollidioten zu bezeichnen.

ich denke mal, du bist da kompetenter als ich - aber ich wollte nicht klassische islamgelehrte, die ich zu wenig kenne, um mich überhaupt über sie äußern zu können, vollidoten nennen. wenn das mißverständlich formuliert war: sorry.

mein zugang zur sache ist, wie erwähnt, die persönliche freundschaft zu einem iranischen muslim (also schiit), dessen großvater (so seine formulierung) wohl so etwas wie ein vorgänger von ayatollah chomeini im amt war, die eltern vom schah-vater vertrieben, er in englischen colleges erzogen, freiwillig mit uns im zivildienst und einfach eine so liebenswerte, sanfte und gebildete person, daß ich gegen islamophobie fortan geimpft war.

ansonsten beziehe ich einen großteil meines ""wissens"" aus radiofeatures, sehr frühe arbeiten von reinhold baumgarten über die sufis bis hin zur fleißarbeit, die der dlf in dieser sache leistet, der ja letztes jahr eine wirklich schöne reihe über die neuen entwicklungen im islam brachte. halt schon in bißchen über dem durchschnittlichen level, aber immer noch ""humble"", man lernt nicht aus. für mich gilt hat /r/dasohristderweg.

das nur, um so ein bißchen meine grenzen abzustecken. ich kann nicht mit dir über al-Wahhāb diskutieren, weil ich da kein wissen habe, lasse mich aber gerne ""in kenntnis setzen"" 

""vollidioten"" sind für mich diese hetzer, die den koran für ihre schäbigen interessen mißbrauchen und damit einen haß gegen eine religion schüren, die ich eher als eine sehr ""friedliche"" begreife. wie gesagt, als buddhist/dàoist verstehe ich zb. die sufis als ""verwandte"" und in rumi einen bruder im geiste. 

&gt; Magst du erklären was du da im Gange siehst? 

ich erzähle an der stelle immer gerne eine anekdote aus den frühen 90ern. in der videothek, dieich da frequentierte, gab es neue filme in maximal 4 exemplaren, sie kosteten 3 mark. alte filme nur eine. eines tages standen da 40 exemplare von ""nicht ohne meine tochter"", funkelnagelneu, für eine mark. da frage ich mich schon, was da läuft, wer so was bezahlt und wohin das wohl gehen soll. ich denke mal, dieser kampf der religionen wird schon seit jahrzehnten systematisch geschürt.

in den früheren tagen im netz, als solche sachen wie PI aufkamen (also die seite, die angeblich israel liebt und die USA, aber die muslime hasst) hatte ich so den verdacht, daß die von religiösen gruppen in den USA und in israel gezielt finanziert wurden und denke das immer noch (ich gehe davon aus, daß du den zwischenton verstehst - ich rede von interessensguppen und nicht ländern oder religionen). der konflikt ist ""gemacht"" und er wird ""geschürt"" - und auch wenn wir das seltsam finden, es gibt gruppen mit einem endzeit-denken, die gerne [das armageddon einläuten](http://www.arte.tv/de/videos/074591-000-A/steve-bannon-der-trump-fluesterer) möchten.

was nicht obskur oder verstörungstechnisch ist, wir wissen heute, daß hitler von der[ thule](http://hinterwaldwelt.blogspot.de/2014/02/aus-den-archiven-thule-01.html) gemacht wurde und der general, der japan in den WWII führte, ebenso einem endzeit-kult angehörte. ""verschwörungen"" auf diesem level sind alltäglich, dafür braucht es keine welteroberungsilluminieten oder blöderberger, es gibt wahrscheinlich tausende solcher gruppen, die alle je ihre sehr unterschiedlichen ziele verfolgen, und - wenn man robert anton wilson folgt - sich eigentlich gegenseitig neutralisieren sollten. aber manchmal bringt so eine gruppe eben einen mechanismus in gang, der eine eigendynamik entwickelt.

das ist das, was wir gerade erleben. unfassbar viele idioten auf einem geistig niedrigen niveau haben ein feindbild gefunden: der böse islam. der ist alles schuld. sie lesen ein buch, picken sich die ""schweinischen stellen"" heraus und plärren hasserfüllt herum

ich denke halt, nein, so ist der islam eben nicht, im gegenteil, wir tragen einen gutteil verantwortung für den zustand, den wir gerade in der arabischen welt erleben. daß dort vollidioten ihre eigenen brötchen backen, macht die sache halt nicht gerade leichter.

oki, soviel aus eine zustand der ruhe heraus ;)

I played TF2 since it came out and only stopped when overwatch came out. I played Pyro a lot and heard the same things about him. Usually from ""high skill ceiling"" mains e.g. spy sniper scout. They dont like being surprised and all the skill it teakes to learn to be a great sniper means nothing when a pyro jumps you from behind. I'm not saying that's you. In fact for an internet disagreement you have been quite civil.

Vici Gaming is chaos itself.... They also had bot lane problems since ever and Martin isn't really the star ADC that they need (but still better than Endless or Xuan).

This behavior of obsessing about things is usually a common sign of autism. That is why people with autism in media are generally shown to have some sort of weird interest or hobby, like naming all of the state capitals, collecting ants, etc, etc. You, if you think literally shoehorning every conversation and photo to be about politics is socially acceptable, have autism.

As a landlord, pet friendly could mean ""I'm a great dog owner who has 1-3 small/medium dogs or 1-2 large dogs which are well trained, house broken, and I pick up after them."". It could also mean ""I have 5 dogs, a puppy mill and I've never heard of poop bags.""

I have rented to both, I personally have two great pryenees, but if I don't want to lay awake at night wondering if my tenants are secretly shitty dog owners. Thats my mentality as a dog owner, there are plenty of landlords who hate dogs because they have been burned in the past. I would estimate that only 10% of private rentals are pet friendly.

1600-1900 is a reasonable range for a house, but it's only reasonable for a house that cost the owner 300-450k. There's no way that you are finding a landlord who is going to take a monthly hit on his mortgage payment if he can find someone willing to pay 2000+. 

The NW is smaller than the SE and 1.5x the price of the NE, it's also highly desirable with a high proportion of homeowners who live there, rather than rentals. You will have a smaller number of homes to choose from compared to other quadrants. ",1496275453

Venus is a little easier to get to than Mars.

Entry and descent is much easier than Mars.

Return to Orbit from 55km is much harder (9000 m/s vs 4000 m/s)

The gravity well and the nasty surface make Venus not much use for anything other than science missions.

"IMDbFilmGeneral","t5_3iwyp","Scott doesn't handle the writing in his films, but he does have no eye for catching glaring errors in the treatments he chooses.  His background is in production design and photography, and in those areas he is still more than competent.  

You can't say the same for Michael Bay, who is making films for action over story, and filming that action extraordinarily badly.  Digital effects cover most of the screen, and the angles chosen hardly seem storyboarded at all.  I can't tell where 60-80% of the *things* are in relation to each other, since the shots are edited out of order and no care was taken to maintain continuity in terms of direction of motion, nor any wide shots for proximity information.  

It would be fine to say Bay is simply a guy who makes action movies, but his movies are among the worst in the genre I have ever seen.  ",1496275455

uh no i'm not i asked what the purpose of insulting him is, seems pretty straightforward. unless you're claiming ""you're an ugly fuckface nerd, go on cumtown"" is criticism

they've made an educated decision about their health &amp; decided the benefits outweigh the costs. that's not hypocritical or lying

We're social creatures because there's a lot of benefits from being social, and we conduct and behave in a certain way in order to maintain those benefits.

If you choose to do that yes you may save some children from being murdered, but it could be at the cost of thousands of other lives in a long war and the complete destruction of another culture.

Its why noone has gone into north korea and replaced the regime over there. Or why noone goes into these muslim countries and just tells them no you cant be muslim anymore you have to follow christian values now. The benefit of doing these things and saving a few lives would be vastly outweighed by the thousands of other lives you'd end by starting a war. To those people they are not acting immoral they are doing what they believe is right and they will fight to defend their values. 

And in many cases, particularly in the middle east, the ruling regime is actually acting to keep radical elements in check. Like when the US went into iraq and we ended up with ISIS. Without the 'evil' dictators controlling the region, radicals are able to gain support and spread their ideas. As conditions become worse people become more desperate and even more radical ideas take route. ",1496275458

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt; Going by the definition that a representative democracy is a minority of people who make decisions on behalf of the majority that elects them,

That's not what a representative democracy is, and from that is where you start having problems. 

&gt;Which is more important to represent: ideas or identity?7

Either. It doesn't matter. Representative democracies aren't dependent upon *who* represents you, only that you believe they're representing you in some form. 

&gt;Can you reach representation in both, and would that be more valuable than reaching representation in the one you consider more important?

There's nothing contradictory in everyone having equal representation. There isn't some ""more important"" demographic. That's a pitfall of democracy, not equal representation.

&gt;Is representation of ideas or identity necessarily a zero sum game, so you can't increase one without cannibalizing the other?

Nope, but all sides see it as much because any political movement or political party is essentially seeking power and authority to influence political decisions. 

&gt;Is focus on identity representation discriminatory, or would it be discriminatory to ignore identity representation?

Both. Welcome to the reality of political representation.

The A/C probably has a leak somewhere and is low on refrigerant.  As the other commenter said, you can buy a cheap refill kit and try to add some refrigerant yourself, but there can be problems with that.  You don't know if there's any air in the system, which needs to be evacuated first to ensure proper cooling.  You also have no way of measuring how much oil is in the system and adding the appropriate amount back into it.  It would suck to recharge the system and get the AC working only to have the compressor lock up from lack of lubrication a few weeks later.

Never in life are you not selling something in some aspect or capacity. Even your friends who've known you 20yrs will ditch you if stop appealling to their sensibilities.

Well, sure.  But here's the thing: I'm not a product.  People are free to go in and out my life as they like.  I don't have a *relationship* with a product.  It's inanimate and doesn't have feelings.  People *do*, therefore my interactions with them are about *their feelings*.  I don't see my presence as a product to sell.

Man, if you think I sound like the Disney Channel, you sound like an 8th grader who read the Communist Manifesto for the first time, super edge and like no one's ever tried to boil down human relationships into equations before.

&gt; Victoria Secret super models are marrying hot, rich pro NFL players and not fat WOW nerds with hearts of gold for a reason...

So, your argument is that hot, famous people marry hot, famous people?  Neat.  That's not really relevant to most people's lives.

&gt; Praying Mantis' are the same species and one of them gets fucking eaten after sex.

This is not true.  It happens occasionally in the wild (about 30 percent of the time), but has really been only observed in captive mantis species.

Also, there is far more brain diversity *within* a gender than *between* the genders.  Have a peek at actual, published studies on this.  Men's and women's brains are largely plastic.  That's where the ""blank-slaters"" are coming from.  People can learn and change habits all throughout their lives.

&gt; When my mom went in to buy a new car, the salesman knew telling her it's engine was weak for it's class was likely going to convince her not to buy the car...so why would he say that? This is basic psychology of interacting with humans bud.

Yeah, but relationships aren't *things*.  What I'm looking for *in a human being* isn't what I'm looking for *in an object*.  I expect an object, especially one I am purchasing for a high price, to be of a certain standard.  In humans, that's not the case.  They aren't machines.  A human being will make mistakes and have bad days.  If my car continually won't start, it's an ineffective car.  A person who struggles to get out of bed isn't an ineffective person.  I might replace the car, but I can't replace the person.

Also, I'm not your bud.

&gt; Then you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how this works. If XYZ is what most women appear to want, and ABC is what most women appear to dislike, and you want to be attractive to women, it makes most sense to either become or appear to be XYZ, and get as far away from ABC as possible, not sit there and say ""oh well, they don't like me. I guess ill just sit here until the universe dumps a woman who does into my lap who randomly likes ABC even though all the proof in the world is demonstrating to me that women universally dislike these qualities in men"".

No, I don't just twiddle my thumbs and wait.  Don't project.  That isn't what I said at all.  Instead, evaluate the information, decide if it's valuable to you, and whether or not you *want* to change that.  For example, I don't want to have kids.  That's a dealbreaker for a lot of people.  It's not attractive.  I don't care.  I'd rather be alone than have children.  Instead, I go out and find people who *also* don't want to have children, and everyone's happier.  There *is no universal*, and this is where we disagree.  You think there is.  I don't think so.  People want different things in relationships.  Yes, there's a general model, but each relationship will have its own quirks and caveats.  Some people will throw that out entirely and reconstruct something they like better (poly or open relationships come to mind).

I'm not terribly invested in how you see me, but have a look through my comment history if you don't believe me: I have worked very hard to be well-adjusted and have never had relationships or sex come easily.  It has been a huge thorn in my side, and you're not unique in your position, and yes, I do know what I'm talking about.

My views are not the damaging ones, here.  I believe that people have the ability to change, and to find affection and love in many forms, warts and all, and that human relations are complex.  You have to work at it, of course, and that's not easy, but it can be done.  You seem to believe that you have to hide all the shitty parts of you so that someone will invest in you, and relationships are little more than transactions between people, like buying a car, and if you can't conform to the mainstream to maximize your chances, you'll end up alone.

Another example is [the story](https://www.rt.com/usa/329006-alabama-police-indian-national/) about the East Indian guy who was taking a walk and got paralyzed by a cop. To a conservative, if the law allows the cop to slam the guy to the ground when he backs up a couple steps, then the action is justified, period. They don't consider whether the cop should have done something else.

Someone like Ben Shapiro is gaining a lot of a following amongst conservatives I know. He's a never Trumper that is a true conservative in every sense of the word. Jordan Peterson is also really good, he's a professor at the University of Toronto. I also follow a couple Twitter accounts (Comfortably Smug, Wu-Tang Financial) that retweet a lot of good conservative viewpoints.

On the other side, I think Chris Arnade is a great liberal voice. I try to keep up with his opinions, he actually goes out and talks to people in middle America to try to find out their grievances. Obviously it's probably not a surprise that I like to listen to Rogan too, he has a large variety of different guests on his show.

It's just so hard to find people who aren't screaming about conspiracy theories on social media. There's some good content out there if you really dig for it though.

Contrast that to the supposed ""announcement"" monero had to pump it's coin to troll its community?  Even the EEAA and the whole conference around ETH?  All of these things fuel the price of their coins superficially when in reality there's not a whole ton of application for it. 

As for Ethereum, ETH will not work and is not designed to be a currency.  If you read the white paper on ETH, it is a token used to access their super computer.  People trade it now as a commodity because dAPPs aren't fully flushed out yet.

LTC is designed specifically to be a currency.  So is BTC.  I hope that helps distinguish the ETH and LTC for you.  ETH is a price built on potential prospect and speculation.  LTC's price is built on it's worth as a currency.  Personally, $25 I think is a great average for now.  It's cheap for people to buy everyday things with.  It's also had $5-7 swings in the past few weeks which attest to its stability despite all the craziness going on.

Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound: requires the target to sit still for several minutes despite being attacked by an unseen creature.  The hound attacks whether you want it to or not.

Teleportation Circle: This requires so much preparation it's entirely unrealistic.  You know that the spell can only send you to other circles, right? And that the casting time is 10 rounds?

Forbiddance: Casting time of 10 minutes. That's 100 rounds. And spellcasters only get two 6th-level spell slots at most.

Illusory Reality: The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm someone. Suffocation is directly harmful.

Symbolism: ""As long as you have enough gold"" is a big fuckin 'if' and you get 2 7th level slots *at most* when you're *max level*.

""Omnipotent Caster"" requires you to ignore a rule in the PHB.

&gt;**To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.**
If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction. PHB 204!

Reverse Gravity is working as intended!

Simulacrum: and how are you going to keep the BBEG still for 12 hours while you cast the spell?  A corpse is not a creature!

Polymorph is working as intended!  Hope you're not required to maintain concentration on whatever you summoned, though!

Do you know that levitation doesn't allow you to move objects laterally? Only vertically!  And it still requires concentration, so as soon as you levitate one item, the other will drop, probably faster than you can recast the spell!  Also, a perpetual motion machine that requires input to keep doing its thing is not a perpetual motion machine!

In regards to Mirror Image, did you know that spell effects don't stack? They do! PHB 205!

Misty Step/Spell Mastery is working as intended!  You can only cast cantrips while you're doing that, though!

Take delivery with proof of mileage, have it taken on a truck bed to a luxury storage facility, you've paid taxes on the value of the vehicle, but you will sell it at or above MSRP.

In addition,  taxed MSRP doesn't include any dealer fee that can be line-itemed onto vehicles that require the dealerships to have certifications/specialists.  I was once looking at a GT-R that had a $20,000 line item of this nature.  When a dealer sells 10 of those specialty cars a year, you get hit with a nut for supporting that dealer having that expert.

As an aside, some brands train the engineers/specialists at the cost of the manufacturer,  not at the cost of the dealer.  BMW and Volvo both do this for certain vehicles.  There are ~250 2017 Volvo V60 Polestars in the US, and each dealership that is selected to sell them has a manufacturer appointed and  certified engineer for that vehicle, who acts as a sales engineer, and a maintenance engineer.  Those costs end up in the MSRP, as they're not taken on by the dealership themselves.

Hosting downloads is another hassle entirely. Depending on the download bandwidth needed you may need an alternate spot for hosting files.

Yes if you're only building 1 and you're a beginner you should start with the basic [wordpress hosting](https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting). Upgrading is super easy and moving your wordpress installation should be no trouble as long as you're not modifying core files. Follow the link and select the basic package and checkout. Once you've checked out, Godaddy will literally walk you through installing Wordpress. I always tell people if you can figure out Facebook there's no way you won't figure out installing Wordpress.

If you choose to upload custom files yourself, you'll be just fine. With wordpress hosting you have SFTP access which is access to the root files that your website runs off. So if you uploaded a file http://mywebsite.com/my-custom-page.html that would work just fine!",1496275470

"environment","t5_2qh1n","&gt;What, pray tell, are socio economic systems if not the entirety of public and private life of the populace?

We're not discussing the definition of socio-economic systems.

You made an assertion that the Paris Agreement was ""a structure designed to control the entire socio-economic order"". That is what is being discussed.

The Paris Agreement is narrowly targeted at industrial-scale emissions as it relates to anthropogenic climate change. That certainly has an economic effect in any nation that voluntarily and individually chooses to work towards the stated goals. However the agreement contains absolutely no provisions regarding any civil rights or social issue, such as gay marriage, or freedom of speech, or religion, or the press.

Now, I don't know what kind of substance you're on over there since you're jumping from one crazy rambling to another. Over here, I'm almost entirely sober save for a bit of Robutussin to deal with viral bronchitis. And the last time I checked, ""the entirety of public and private life"" included a whole host of non-economic social concepts such as...you guessed it, gay marriage, or freedom of speech/religion, or independence of the press, etc etc.

An agreement that contains absolutely no provisions for such non-economic social concepts cannot possibly, *by definition*, control ""the entire socio-economic order"". Therefore, your assertion is patently false.

*That* was what we were discussing. Not the definition of socio-economic systems, but instead, your assertion regarding the Paris Agreement.

&gt;It is written there in black and white.

No, it isn't. 

You are repeatedly making arbitrary claims devoid of justification or evidence, and you're expecting everyone to simply accept them as universal obvious truths. Reality doesn't work like that. 

&gt;Man you need to read 1984.

I've read 1984, and Animal Farm, and most of what Orwell penned. I read them in the context of Orwell's own political views.

1984 is not the ""predictive"" work that pop culture claims it to be. Orwell didn't write it to warn society or guess about the future. 1984 was written as an attack the myth that Soviet Union is a socialist state. Orwell himself was a socialist, and he was trying to make sure that the idea of socialism was disconnected from the USSR, so that the cause of socialism was not unjustly damaged by the inevitable fall of the Soviet Union. The labeling of Oceania as Ingsoc (English Socialism) was deliberate doublethink, as Oceania rejected and vilified every principle that the Socialist movement actually stood for.

If you really want to talk about something predictive, read Huxley's Brave New World.",1496275472

Double-standard.

Second, that of all the horrible stuff that happens on the show, somehow her fucking Ted is the worst thing? Walt literally murdered hundreds of people, but an adulterous woman is somehow the real turn-off for the audience.

Third, that people repeatedly deny that she was raped on the show. Again, Vince confirms that she was raped in Season 5. Yet people on this sub bend over backgrounds to deny it. I don't understand why? because they can't accept that maybe Skyler's annoying characteristics (which I never experienced as a viewer, but seem to be the overarching response) were caused by being in a traumatic situation?

These three things that people hate about her seem to be more about her gender than general characterization. We can accept and appreciate highly complex male characters, like Walt, Jesse, and Gus, but we can't accept Skyler? And again, in a show where the main characters kill families, rape people, torture people, and poison children, *Skyler* is somehow the bad guy?",1496275474

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I thought about this myself (am Norwegian). It didn't take me very long to realize that it would be a dumb idea, though. I write English at a competent level, and I could probably see it through - but I would never be able to articulate myself as well as I would in Norwegian. This is simply because I've done far more writing in Norwegian (think about everything you've done at school, through your childhood). 

I find myself coming up with story concepts when thinking in English from time to time, but I don't think I could do the story justice unless I write in Norwegian. Think about a passage of well written English fiction that you like, for example. Assess your abilities. Would you be able to do something similarly complex in English, or would German suit you better? I suspect so. I usually find a lot of words when reading English that I know I'd never come up with when writing. You may write better English than most englishmen, but when it comes to it, your German is probably more developed (I don't know anything about you, but I reckon this is a pretty safe bet). This is what you want to practice. Even if you can only think of certain words in English when writing, just look it up in a dictionary, and find the translation - and you probably wont have that problem with that exact word again. It's normal to be writing in your native language, and then come up with a sentence/word in English. Just use sometime finding a suitable translation. 

You write better in German. Take the time to hone your skills. Maybe some day, you'll get an e-mail from someone who wants to translate your book to another language, or you'll find you want to do it yourself. Start with what you know, though. ",1496275478

My bad. In your post that I responded to, you said:

You're saying that faith = trust/reliance in God, yes? And I'm saying that it's a false equivocation; you can say 'live in the present"" and 'give him a present,' but the word 'present' is not the same in these two sentences. The use of faith to mean 'trust' is not what theists tend to mean when they say they faith in God; they are saying that they already believe in God, and the reason why is 'faith.' I'm not talking about definitions, but usages, which I think is more important.

My main point was simple, his most impressive feats have been his ability to start successful business in volatile spaces. Not single handedly solving the worlds problems through inventions, as he has yet to do that. His rhetoric is reminiscent of Steve Jobs and is a marketing ploy to have customers bonded to a business. No doubt he is ideological and a part of the rhetoric is based on truth but he's no different from other great entrepreneurs who have pioneered new spaces in industry. When he has to, he makes business decisions, not ideological ones however. Whether he wants to or not he has to. So how he feels doesn;t make much of a difference. If his goal is to get everyone using electric vehicles, he needs to make decisions that make a business selling electric cars profitable, regardless of his ideologies. Example, the cadmium mines required for his solar panels. I doubt the pollution caused by those are what he wants for the earth, but to make it profitable he must do it. By solving a problem through business he has to make business decisions before following his ideology. He is a entrepreneur who has a goal that you agree with, however you know of him because he is so good at navigating the markets, and not purely his ideologies.",1496275481

think you mean endure them since he couldn't keep up with either and got hit a lot




&gt; It should be mentioned that Natsu was in dragon force, but Natsu and Gajeel Together would have more power and hit more often than Dragonforce Natsu.

ehhh, Dragonforce Natsu is 2-3 times more powerful than normal natsu, 1 person twice the strength of 2 people shouldn't lose to those 2 people normally. Plus Gajeel isn't as strong as Natsu, so a natsu ~2.5 times stronger than normal should be above both of them. If you reread the fight between Jellal and Natsu, Jellal was outclassing Natsu by a lot, he couldn't get a proper hit in, but dragonforce made him so much stronger he outclassed him by insane amounts.


&gt; In his fight with Wall, he was bombarded with several damaging projectiles and was still able to fight and ultimatly beat him.

you think those hits hit harder than 4 oracian sies members at the same time? I'd doubt it, also I mentioned how this would be Jellal and Laxus at the tartaros arc, not the final arc. If so, Jellal surviving being crushed by Acnologia is way higher than Wall's attack",1496275481

I'm assuming you're wondering if you're actually cancelling animations or just slowly auto attacking between every q. 

There's really no way to tell without actually timing yourself doing the combo but rest assured that if you just go into practice mode and practice it, even slowly, you will get faster. 

Try practicing by going auto - q - move command - auto - q - move command SLOWLY at first. Adding in the move command is the crucially important part and I found it helped a lot to go very slowly at first and ramp up my tempo as I got more comfortable with the movements. ",1496275482

I can also think on multiple levels at once? Which i think everyone can do but, again, I sometimes hear otherwise. like i can count breaths and be saying think about nothing and at the same time thinking about how i can't think about nothing because i'm thinking about tax law and then on the next level i'm thinking about tax law, etc. 

I also wonder if it's a handy way to obscure thoughts should we encounter mind readers. So I take my various levels of thoughts/sense-images and smash them like dinner plates over my mental knee and rotate everything 90 degrees and stitch it together like a weird chess board when i'm feeling paranoid.

and at this point, it's all just random maundering so. 

also, i usually write in circles because linear stuff frustrates the crap outta me.

In daylight you might be able to use shorter exposures to cut motion blur enough that it isn't visible.

A monopod might help without being a tripod.

&gt; is the kit lens the only one made with a stabilizer

Kit lenses are intended to be low cost introductory lenses. Other than a useful focal length range for a very low price, they don't really have any exclusive features that aren't found in at least some other lenses.

&gt; are there other Canon lens that have one that are recommended?

I can think of thirteen Canon telephoto zooms with stabilization. And several more made by third party manufacturers for the Canon EF mount.

Do you have a price range in mind? Or should we assume it's unlimited?

A 4 man squad camping a house or a roof and leaving all doors closed everywhere would mean instant death for anyone coming close.

The narrative doesn't add up, and Big Pharma is lining its pockets. I originally thought more local, like you, about Brazil. It just seems obvious, right? Seemingly-localized populations of poor Brazilians conceiving Zika babies. Is this an example of elites culling the herd of po' folk?

GMO mosquitoes: Confirmed.

GMO crops (and pesticide abuse, soil depletion): Confirmed

Insecticides in drinking water: Confirmed

However, people traveling to the area can also get Zika. It has spread to other warm climate areas, the mosquitoes carrying it and cases of Zika-cephaly. 

Are elites targeting the poor, operation: population control? Personally I don't think so. This is an indication of an overwhelming decline of the human immune system due to factors stated above in previous post. Is zika targeting the poor? No, but the poor are disproportionately affected by it because (surprise, surprise!) as compromised as the immune systems of much of the population of the world are becoming, the poor have it much worse. 

Take an example of people from the same location, some poor and some well-off. We suffer similar environmental toxins, but money provides choices...

I can use my money to buy better produce from (supposedly) better soil with a better nutrient complex. I can use my money to buy a water filtration system. I can buy supplements for those missing nutrients. And believe me, I do.

Skinsuits I find to be so non-functional that unless you're racing the pointy end of elite, and only racing at the venue (ie, not riding home) I'm not sure why you'd do it.

Having used a dozen different brands over the years, the two brands I'd most recommend in terms of being a good cut *and* the chamios actually lasting a long time would be either Sugoi, or Champion Systems.  Santini and Ventou the chamois wear out and come apart (of the half dozen sets of each I've had), Castelli's and 2XU's sizes are completely retarded, and along with Cycology the chamois placement and size is just wrong.  /r/bicycling insist on using Castelli and after owning three or four sets it's frankly the worst brand I've ever had the displeasure of having to wear, and sadly means I won't be buying future reddit kit.

1. Maintaining 'frame' ie dominance/submissive game playing where you give the impression you will lead and she will follow. You're not going to ask her you're going to tell her.

2. Spend as little money as possible. Don't shell out when you're not getting a fuck.

3. Get physical as soon as possible. Don't consider consent or cues. Getting as physical as possible to establish a pattern that she will likely allow due to trying not to start a scene.

4. Get her to talk about her dreams, goals, and accomplishments ala NLP so she associates you with good things.

5. Pretend that you didn't approach her solely based on her looks.

6. Apologize as little as possible only do so when it's unavoidable ala extreme cases.

9. Establish from the get go your intention is physical so she will get accustomed when you start breaking more boundaries. ",1496275493

Resolution guide in the top left is inaccurate though. Here's the correct numbers:

SD resolution: assuming NTSC, which they did, it's 483 visible vertical lines (525 total). The number of pixels in either direction is actually really hard to nail down on this as things like overscan change the number a lot. The 720x480 resolution shown is the anamorphic digital value used on DVDs, but the actual analog signal is more like 480x480, and the pixels are not square but 4:3 aspect ratio. The same is true of PAL, only instead of 525 lines it's 625 lines.

HDTV (broadcast) resolutions:

* 1280x720: HD
* 1920x1080: Full HD
* 3840x2160: 4K Ultra HD (**not Quad HD as in diagram**)

DCI (Cinema, Production) resolutions:

* 2048x1080: 2K
* 4096x2160: 4K (*they actually got this one right, but it's not the 4K most people are talking about*)
* 8192x4320: 8K, not shown but for comparison to 4K so you can see where the ""K"" comes from.

Other (computer) resolutions:

* 2560x1440: Quad HD (QHD), from it being 4 HD resolution images worth of space. Referred to as ""2K"" by way too many people, when 2K is actually basically 1080p.
* 5120x2880: ""5K"" ",1496275493

Some humans embrace or at least accept change, are willing to train for modern jobs and move to where the jobs and opportunities are, and some resist any and all change, resist education and resist moving off some desolate plot of land away from opportunities. 

Those that resist *any* change are doomed to a lower socio-economic tier. Then they compound the errors by clinging to GOP candidates that only give lip service to narrow wedge issues while gutting the support systems for the rural areas. They are literally voting themselves deeper into a hole that many won't escape without a serious change in mindset. Neither the Democrats nor the GOP are going to save people that vote against their own interests. If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny that those who argue the loudest for ""pulling oneself up by one's own bootstraps"" so rarely think to do it themselves. 

That's not to say I'm not quite sympathetic to people caught in poverty traps, but that empathy dissipates after generations that resist learning and resist growing beyond their grandparents conceptualizations of community tied to a dirt tract. 

Another way many compound the errors is by clinging to land in floodplains or land that was previously agricultural in an era where it is no longer viable to be a small family farm. Again, adapt to change one way or another or wither. That's as true of urban areas as rural. You've simply got to be adaptable to change. The one constant in nature over time is adapt or die.

I do suggest that you do this though when wild caught salmon is in season (and on sale) at your local grocery store (of course if you don't want to go to a specialty or seafood market). It's usually end of July-September. 

I don't use a recipe but a good starting point is a pound of salmon, 2 table spoons of butter, two cloves of garlic minced, the juice of 1/2 to a whole lemon (depending on how lemony you want it), and salt and pepper. Cook in the oven at 400 for like 15 mins. 

For the veggies, just cut into bite sized pieces, toss in olive oil (and whatever other spices you want) spread on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and throw it in with the salmon!

Sure, perhaps a jury won't buy it, but most DAs I know would consider charging it. Especially if they wanted to leverage a plea. Or unless they are morons.

And the author keeps talking about the fact that with a misdo a criminal can't be sent to prison. True. But he fails to mention that many of the misdos he cites carry sentences up to one year in jail, and that some of those could be stacked. While some of those felonies sometimes resulted in LESS time actually spend in state prison; indeed, some clients we had preferred a sixteen mo prison term over jail because of existing oddities in sentencing and how much time they had in and because of extra privileges in SP.

There was, and is a bill of goods being sold, as by this author. And to the public, who they attempt to scare into thinking these prison (vs county jail) sentences made a different. They didn't and don't and nobody yet knows the net effect on crime.

After you spend enough time doing grown up, responsible things (working a job, having friends, cleaning where you live, etc). Do things that make a positive impact on your own life and on the lives of others.

But here's the catch: It will be very difficult to do Grown Up Things at first. It will be so hard that you'll want to give up and do other things instead (like watching Netflix).

But don't give up. Keep spending time trying to do Grown Up Things. Because after you spend enough hours Trying to be responsible, it will get easier to be responsible.

Apparently on that website its ELO is only 2400 (to be able to play competitively) while the latest versions are in the low to mid 3,000's... but I have also heard that comparing human to chess ELO is difficult b/c computer vs. computer games are included in computer scores, but not in human scores. I'm obviously out of my league in trying to understand these numbers. I'm a CPA by trade, and my interest in chess goes little beyond playing a few dozen or so games throughout my life.

I have also seen anecdotal evidence of humans winning against even the strongest chess programs, but again without the record there is no way to verify this. Also most of those anecdotes are from 2014 or earlier, before the sorts of advances of AlphaGo and similar AI.

Thus I will concede that it is very near impossible for humans to beat the latest and greatest computer chess programs without odds. I won't say *entirely* impossible, but the latest and greatest computer would win or draw 99.99% of the time against even a Magnus Carlsen probably.

WW2 it is as violent as everyone can think off. The Soviets are attacking Nazi positions for only god knows what time. During the attack suddenly one of the Nazi held hills raises a soviet flag. The army storms the hill, takes it and due to the momentum roles on.

The two men who got the flag in place receive their honors and ... that is it. No stories no nothing. Guys refuse any commentary regarding the storming of the hill whatsoever. People try to dig up some more juicy stuff about the battle but nothing. Just complete silence from both of them.

Years past, comrades get together and get one of the soldiers wasted to the point he is willing to start speaking about the assault. Story goes:

&gt; During one of the numerous assaults he and his partner took up positions in one of the trenches covered by planks. AND THEN they discovered everyone else had retreated.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","OP, I've got to say, I just started watching your source videos - particularly the second video, and it is being extremely fair and balanced. They are weighing the pros and cons of Pathfinder and D&amp;D in a very reasonable way. Also, I would hardly call them rules lite gamers based upon this since they didn't include any rules lite systems in the discussion.

The first video is just someone discussing RPG theory and how he thinks that games like D&amp;D and Fate that create mechanics that create distinctions between the player and the character do not qualify as roleplaying games. It's an extreme perspective, but it's nothing offensive. It's just his opinion, and he clearly explains himself with logical reasons. If you think that logic is flawed (like I do), you are welcome to disagree with it. But he's not bashing Fate, he's sharing his opinion of what classifies something as an RPG or a Story-Game based upon a logical argument.

And the third video is just some guy in his car and it has a total of 64 views (most of which were probably because of this post).

The only reason I bring this up is because I am concerned that this might not actually be a real issue, at least not on this sub. The examples you linked were really really not convincing, and especially with how reasonable the second video was.. I just don't know what to think.

"playrust","t5_2xks2","I've floated the idea before that there should be a skill system.

For example, no one is born knowing how to make a Bow or Arrows even.  Most of us probably have a pretty good idea, but the actual skill in making a bow takes a lot of practice.

So, when you first get into the game your bow making skill is low.  The first bow you make has a high chance of breaking when you try to fire an arrow.  It's more flimsy, so the aim is off.  The more bows you make the better your bow crafting skill gets.  The higher your bow crafting skill, the more damage, durability, velocity of the arrow, and aim.

Now apply this to guns.  Let's say the skill level is 0-100.  If you find all of the parts to a Semi Auto Pistol and make it when your gun crafting skill is 0, there is a high chance that the gun is going to explode in your hands the first time you shoot it or it could misfire and you have to reload the gun to clear the misfire.  Once you reach gunsmithing level 20 your SAPs are decent and have a much lower chance of misfiring, the greater your gunsmithing skill the less likely you SAPs are going to misfire.  It takes level 30 to make decent SARs, 40 to make decent Custom SMGs, 50 to make decent Thompsons, 65 to make decent MP5s, and 85 to make decent AKs.  Once you reach level 100 Gunsmithing, your SAPs have less than 1% chance of misfiring whereas your AKs have less than 15% change of misfiring.

Remember, this game is Rust...  All of the parts that you're finding to make these guns are old and rusted.

To level up Gunsmithing, you could just grind out Eokas all the way to level 100, but that would take forever...  If you make an AK at level 0 and it assembles properly, you gain a decent amount of XP towards your Gunsmithing, maybe at level zero you get taken to level 5 from making an AK, but again that AK is going to have something like a 60% chance of misfiring.

This ends up extending the early play with Bows, Crossbows, Revolvers, Waterpipes, etc. as most people are going to want to increase their gunsmithing skill before actually taking an AK, MP5, SAR, etc. out as it could be to the detriment of the player.

To one up all of this, you introduce blueprints back into the game.  A blueprint is a one-time item that temporarily increases your skill by 20 levels when crafting that specific item.  So for instance, let's say you find a blueprint for a SAP and your gunsmithing is level 0.  The SAP you create with that blueprint will be made as if your gunsmithing level is 20.

If let's say your gunsmithing is maxed at level 100, the blueprint for an AK would make it as though your gunsmithing was level 120 and would be a near perfect AK with less than 0.01% chance of misfiring.

This could be applied to armor making, ammo making (does the ammo fire? does it explode in the barrel? etc.), and explosive making.

I don't think there should be a bow shooting, gun shooting, or melee weapon skill as I believe people should naturally use their hand-eye coordination as they do now to fight.  But this crafting skill tree would introduce a new dynamic into the game and I believe it would extend the length of a server's life as you would be invested into that server with your crafting skills.",1496275502

* Drag me away from War Thunder? Hahahahahahahahahaha
* KV-1s are always a pain in the ass to kill, simply because you need to be right up in their faces unless they're uptiered.

&gt;I don't see myself as a man and I never have so why would I tell you I was born as one

That's not just ""an excuse,"" it's a legitimate reason for not bringing it up. Unless she tells you it's relevant to who she is now, it's not. No one has a *right* to another person's past, *especially* parts of it that were probably traumatic. Maybe she would have chosen to share them with you, and maybe she never would have, but that's her choice, and if she chooses to share, that's a gift, not something she owes you. All sorts of hurtful things happen to people, especially trans people, and especially women, and thinking someone owes you the intimate details of things that hurt them isn't fair. Have you shared every intimate detail of everything that hurt *you* growing up? 

She wants you to see her for her, and now you're having this big complicated reaction that's centered around you and how *her* trauma makes *you* feel. Think about how this situation must feel from her perspective: without her consent, her friend told you something deeply personal that the friend had no business sharing, and then you got mad and ""confront"" her about her own trauma. I know you feel hurt, but that hurt stems from a the teachings of a transphobic society that says trans people aren't *really* their gender; that trans people owe others an explanation of their lives and their pasts and their traumas. If you feel like she wasn't telling you the truth about being a woman, you might want to have a real long thought about that. 

Honestly she's the wronged party here, and she doesn't owe you an apology. (If we're being super honest here, you probably owe her an apology, for talking with her friend about something so intimate without her permission.)

&gt;if she would've told me the truth I might've been able to get past it and love her for who she is

That's probably *why* she didn't tell you. Because now, instead of seeing her, you're seeing her past. If, in the 5 months you've been together, you had no idea she's trans, how is it relevant? There are millions of cis women on this earth who can't bear children, and many more who are cut off from people in their past for all sorts of reasons. She's no different from any of them. She's not ""a woman who used to be a man,"" she's a woman, full stop. ",1496275503

I tend to not get deep into the risk management mentality, as anything that puts me at risk, given the severe consequences, is simply not worth it.

However, in the last several years I have on rare occasion when there's nothing else available and I'm sick as shit had some NyQuil. I also don't shy away from foods with alcohol in them. Cakes and desserts I don't like, as the alcohol taste is pretty in your face and can get the gears turning. 

That's my experience. No one size fits all... I just try to remember that what may be fine for me may kill you and what may be fine for you may kill me. ",1496275503

**Questions about a hold harmless agreement/NDA... Wondering what options I have.**
&gt;http://imgur.com/a/Mo46e
&gt; 
&gt; My wife was hospitalized and I had to board the dog because I had to work and wanted to be with my wife when I could. So, I ended up boarding him at this place for three days (2 nights). I had signed the above document like 6 months ago when I was taking him their for daycare for a few days before I ended up switching to a different place. When I went to pick up my dog the person working their handed him to me and I carried him to the car, then when we got home and it was time for him to walk into the house he could barely move and I noticed his eye was swollen shut, all 4 of his paws were bloody and red and had discharge... I called the Emergency Vet and they said it could probably wait until morning... Took him in the next day and he had infections in all 4 of his paws and his eye was more or less OK but he needed ointment for it. A week later he still is still limping and still has wounds on his paws. I'm going to have to take him back to the vet again... It is possible he will need surgery was he may have a foreign object in-bedded in his paw. But as you can imagine with my wife being hospitalized and me taking a couple days off, boarding the dog, vet bills, etc etc... This is causing a serious financial burden for us.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm basically hoping that there is some way I can still take this to small claims... Or that because they list their services at the bottom of the agreement and ""dog boarding"" isn't included that that may not be included under the ""activities"" mentioned in the agreement.
&gt; 
&gt; I did talk to the owner who didn't even apologize, basically told me shit happens and then hung up.
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing I am curious about is the non-disparagement part... I am wondering if I can word a yelp/google review in such a way as to not violate that... I don't want this happening to other people.
&gt; 
&gt; I just realized that I don't know what is listed on the agreement that I actually signed under ""activity"" ""dates(s) of activity)"" and ""location""
&gt; 
&gt; but almost certainly nothing like ""boarding"" and any date near this one because I signed that thing specifically for doggy daycare sometime last year.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice is appreciated... All I want is fair compensation for the injury to my dog and I want to prevent this from happening to other animals. I would have been happy if they had just told me my dog was sick because I would have taken him to the vet earlier or picked him up earlier... Thank you.",1496275503

&gt; # [Diez consorcios compiten por la construcción del Túnel de Agua Negra, una obra de 1500 millones de dólares](http://bucket.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/18/2464918.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Ya analizan los requisitos y antecedentes de 29 empresas que se asociaron para una obra de 1.500 millones de dólares y que demorará 9 años en construirse.
&gt; 
&gt; Miércoles 31 de mayo de 2017 • **20:08**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; En la sede del Ministerio de Obras Públicas en Santiago de Chile, las autoridades de ese país y Argentina encabezaron el acto de recepción de antecedentes de precalificación para la contratación del diseño del proyecto ejecutivo y construcción del túnel Internacional paso de Agua Negra.
&gt; 
&gt; Fueron 29 las empresas interesadas, las que se constituyeron en 10 consorcios, entre los que se encuentran: ACS, China Railway (CR), Skanska, Vinci Construction y Bechtel Corporation. Están presentes las compañías más importantes del mundo, que tienen sus bases en España, Francia, China, Estados Unidos y Suiza. Estiman que el análisis de los requisitos demorará alrededor de tres meses, por lo que en setiempre se sabría cuáles siguen el carrera y en marzo del 2018 se haría el llamado a licitación.
&gt; 
&gt; Del acto participaron el ministro de Obras Públicas de Chile, Alberto Undurraga Vicuña, el Embajador de Argentina en Chile, José Octavio Bordón, el gobernador de San Juan, Sergio Uñac, el secretario de Planificación del ministerio de Transportes de la Nación, Germán Bussi, representantes de la cancillería argentina y chilena, además de representantes del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), organismo que financiará la obra que se calcula en US$1.500 millones. También participan autoridades de Coquimbo y San Juan.
&gt; 
&gt; El paso de Agua Negra. Foto: Archivo El llamado a precalificación de empresas se inició el 16 de octubre del año pasado, cuando se reimpulsó el EBITAN, Ente Binacional Túnel de Agua Negra. En esa oportunidad se convocó a las empresas o consorcios internacionales que desearan participar del proceso licitatorio de la obra a presentar sus antecedentes.
&gt; 
&gt; El gobernador de San Juan, Sergio Uñac, dijo durante su discurso que ""no sólo estamos construyendo un túnel, estamos construyendo futuro"", agregando que ""esta es una de las licitaciones que va a marcar el rumbo de toda América Latina. ""Quiero que mis palabras sean de un profundo agradecimiento a ambos presidentes, Macri y Bachelet. Sin ellos, esto no sería posible"", finalizó el mandatario.
&gt; 
&gt; El ministro de Obras de Chile, Alberto Undurraga Vicuña, no dudó en calificar a esta jornada como ""día histórico, estamos dando un gran paso en la consolidación del Túnel Agua Negra"", manifestó el funcionario.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Los requisitos
&gt; 
&gt; Las que cumplan con ciertos requisitos técnicos y económicos serán las que pasarán a la siguiente fase: tener a su haber la construcción de un túnel de más de 5 kilómetros y contar una importante espalda financiera (US$500 millones de patrimonio); experiencia; la longitud del túnel que han construido (si es ferroviario o carretero); la altitud de los portales; y la superficie del área de excavación.
&gt; 
&gt; El consorcio mejor posicionado obtendrá un puntaje que será el de máxima referencia. Los que estén dentro de esos parámetros serán los que tendrán acceso a los pliegos licitatorios y pasarán a la siguiente etapa, de las ofertas económicas. Se espera que el proceso licitatorio de este túnel de 13,9 kilómetros que se emplazará en la cordillera de Elqui esté listo el primer trimestre el próximo año.
&gt; 
&gt; ## La obra
&gt; 
&gt; El túnel de Agua Negra es una obra de 13,9 kilómetros que tendrá 2 tubos de circulación, uno de ida y uno de vuelta. Su inversión de estima en 1.500 millones de dólares, los que serán aportados por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID). Se calcula que su construcción propiamente tal podría tardar entre 8 y 10 años. Una vez en funcionamiento, se proyecta un flujo diario de 2.200 vehículos, el 70 por ciento de carga, según los estudios de pre inversión. Será una obra de características únicas, pues será el séptimo paso en el mundo que unirá dos naciones. Inclusive se anticipa que será la obra más importante de Latinoamérica después de la ampliación del Canal de Panamá.
&gt; 
&gt; La obra contará de nueve fases y demorará alrededor de nueve años en construirse. La mitad de ese tiempo será insumido por la perforación de la cordillera.

I actually think WHM got the best actual changes of all the healers, the cross class MP refresh is better than shroud of saints was, cure and cure II got buffed, thin air is absolutely insane, assize and benediction both got buff through having cooldowns slashed, they got two new oGCD heals, as well as the lilies which is an (admittedly small) buff to all of their oGCDs, old and new. 

AST got some good QoL changes, discard,things to do with unwanted cards, the mega draw is great and the AoE explosion/heal is really good. But they also have their DoT potency slashed by losing combust and aero and lost their speed buff, gaining 15% heal potency instead. The lord and lady cards are really cool, but the damage from it won't make up for the lost DPS from the DoTs and speed buff and the heal from it will be pretty rare.

SCH came out pretty well with the crit boost, excogitation is a cool think to be able to spend AF stacks on pre-emptively and we'll have to see how good aetherpact is. On the other hand, they lost bio, bane got nerfed and they also lost miasma II and blizzard II.Losing bio is a slight DPS loss, but they're AoE DPS is now going to be pretty low.

When you're mixed with half people you know and half you don't know, then it's easier to talk since you're not in a totally strange environment. If she's interested, she'll keep talking to you, making more eye contact and such. If she gets distracted easily, then she's not interested.

Sort of feel bad for not using the feature...but only because I'm already carpooling with colleagues from work.

But hopefully it works out for people. The carpooling is SO very handy and that's straight up with my office colleagues.

Important caveats from the article if people didn't read:

&gt;The noncommercial nature of the rides means that drivers will not have to carry commercial car insurance, nor will they have to undergo background checks, which Uber, Lyft and taxi drivers must undergo before they can drive for those services.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Breath of the Wild came close, but here's what I'm looking for. Let me know if there is a game like this! 

The run down\things to note:
My favorite thing in gaming are Legend of Zelda's dungeons and puzzles. The dungeons ""generally"" have a great atmosphere, enemy/boss, outside setting, and puzzles.

One thing Zelda hasn't done too well, besides Botw, is having large/free roaming world's. Many Bethesda titles can accomplish this in spades, hence the Botw being inspired by Skyrims exploration. Botw definitely had this, but felt a little undercut due to Shrines.The Shrines acted like mini dungeons, but they all had the same exact feeling, exterior look, and music. They didn't feel too different from each other.

Since they didn't feel ""unique"" after the 50th out of 120 Shrines, the landscapes/views of Hyrule became its strongest gift for exploring, which isn't a bad thing though. Now, the same argument could be made with caves in Skyrim, so this isn't me bashing one or the other.

My game:
I want a fantasy rpg. I would like character customization, but not everything. I want a character, not one I create, that's established and has baring in the world they are apart of. Fallout came close to what I'm describing if you kinda get where I'm going. I don't want a blank slate, but also want to customize to some degree. The world should be large and beautiful with different cultures inhabiting it. I want a story that's got emotion, something that makes you hurt, laugh, and question. I want LoZ dungeons to explore. Not like 4, or 6, or 8. I want like 12 lol, and I want all to be different, difficult, and extremely large. BOTW'S four main dungeons weren't really these at all. I like to get distracted on my journey. But, distract me with worth while things. Make caves and shrines very unique from one to another. Have a good plot twist. And unique items. I love that about LoZ as well. I want hookshots, boomerangs, and a bunch of other nic nak gagets to get me through any sort of conflict. Combat needs to be slowly evolving as you grow stronger.

But that's my game. Something like LoZ, Skyrim, Shadows of the Colossus, Fallout, and Zero Dawn.",1496275514

*****
&gt; President Trump&amp;#039;s immigration crackdown is already crimping economic growth as undocumented workers fearful of deportation stay home and reduce their spending, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said Wednesday.

&gt; Besides getting tough on illegal immigration, Trump has vowed to scale back legal immigration, in part by giving preference to more highly-skilled foreign workers.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s crackdown on both illegal and legal immigration is likely to reduce net immigration to the U.S from about 1 million to about 750,000 annually, estimates Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody&amp;#039;s Analytics.

Because of this arms race, components that used to be popular and expensive aren't now. There's also a lot of overhead on the flagships, r&amp;d testing, advertising , designing, etc. That cheaper phones don't have. In the case of Moto's line, they've actually put work into them, but work on cheaper components and slimmer margins, where a Samsung Admire likely doesn't.

No, humans won't bring the sixth mass extinction. A good portion of todays published studie's are bullshit, especially when it comes to topics where some opinions are extremly well funded - or when they are from china. And nature doesn't have any moral. Nature doesn't give a fuck if all whales are harpooned or every ape is dying. They will be replaced asap by other species. It may has consequences for other species, but nature is more like a pendulum than anything else. Every niche will be replaced and change is nothing bad per se. And if you don't understand what I just wrote - stop having an opinion about such topics because you don't know anything about biology. And even if something is published in nature, it isn't carved in stone. They publish bullshit often enough.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Even from the first moment they had to get pretty creative to adapt a regular game engine to this.

64 bit floating number (double precision) only allows you to move something like 20 km away from the reference point before the precision becomes noticeably bad (ei. everything including particle effects move in steps of centimeters to meters). It has been a limiting factor for fligh-sim style games, especially ones that feature modern fighter jets.  
In KSP they made the move of having your space-ship BE the reference point in terms of the normal game engine stuff. Things that orbit (planets, moons, spacecraft you are not looking at, etc.) are then in a seperate home-brewed space I believe.  
Because of that the game has a physics range/unloading range which was recently upped to 22.5 km, anything outside that is unloaded and only the orbit is kept track of, anything outside the range that encounters an atmosphere is lost on ""impact"".

Anyway, I thought that was a cool way to take advantage of the graphics+physics engines that come with a general game engine (Unity) while still allowing for space shenanigans across millions of kilometers.",1496275518

"shiba","t5_2s5ny","Vet visit doesn't hurt. A dog at that age shouldn't be regressing and a large percentage of the time is a symptom of an underlying issue. I would put my money more on him having some health issues than it being a behavior issue.

If the vet doesn't find anything, you might want to start doing potty training again. Reward him when he poops outside, do crate training...

If you aren't walking him every morning/evning, I would start doing that along with a feeding schedule. That way, you are more likely to control when he poops. If he is on a schedule and you walk poops out of him, he has little to no chance to poop inside.

If you aren't catching him in the act of pooping, punishing him for pooping isn't actually doing anything. He isn't associating your punishment with the poop. Dogs don't actually have the ability to understand what you are upset about, even if you are showing him the poop. Trust me, he really doesn't know he is in the wrong. All he knows is that sometimes you come down to the basement and get upset and somehow poop is involved, but he doesn't have the cognitive ability to put the pieces together. Also as an shiba owner who intensely struggled with potty training, it really doesn't actually work.

You do have some time. Until the baby is crawling and you are putting them on the floor, you have about 6-9 months after they are born to keep working on this issue before it REALLY becomes a serious health issue.",1496275525

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Economically GDP growth looks good but they can't raise the interest rates because it's all built on debt.

Post-secondary education we are worse off than the states IMO because not only do we have massive waste but many of the useful degrees immediately move to the US and take their tax revenue and innovation with them. The top earners who stay are mostly health care or other public service which means they take more tax revenue than they pay.

The education thing worries me because that is the tax base that is supposed to pay for the health care and OAS of rapidly aging population. The strategy seems to be boost population and GDP via immigration which is a raw deal for citizens because GDP per capita growth is either flat or negative with high levels​ of immigration. Our (legal) immigrants are not high earners like the US, they are inferior replacements for the brain drain pretty much by definition (if they weren't they would have gotten the higher-paying US jobs that Canadians got instead).

These are the problems I see really sinking this country in the long term. Not just the problems but the politics that we deploy to 'solve' them. More money dumped into universities without economic viability tests, more deficits and low interest rates to keep building debt, higher and higher taxes to pay for all the inefficiencies and keep the public sector happy. 

Fundamentally I think there is a limit on how much power the public sector can have in a  democracy before they just vote for themselves, fuck over the private sector and drive a country into the ground and we passed it. If I had to pinpoint why/when it would probably come back to education and how much money and influence they have now.  We brag about our crazy high post-secondary education rates but where is the resulting money?

Again I don't think things are going to be horrible but the disappointing thing is that politicians don't seriously talk about or address these problems because the realities don't feel good to people (ie. No we shouldn't pay for your philosophy degree you should get your hands dirty and learn a trade) and so in the short term there are no votes in it for them.

edit: I went on a public sector tangent there but the private sector and citizens in general are equally to blame, they love their bubbles and the government is too worried about their popularity to pop them so they just keep inflating them and hope they hold until the next election.",1496275526

The people who take acid aren't hurting anyone. It's a very small section of addicts who are even a threat. And most of the reason they are a threat is because the drug itself is illegal. Look at alcohol. Socially acceptable and (IMO) prob the worst drug to be addicted to alongside benzos. But because it's legal people don't have to worry about dealers or toxins (like fent in heroin), and it being legal makes it way cheaper. Plus drug addiction isn't a criminal issue, and making it one won't help addicts.

"mflb","t5_2rs76","This might look technical if you're high but trust me.

Batteries deliver power in two ways. Voltage and amperage. If a battery was a fire truck, amperage is how much water is in the tank, voltage is how hard it sprays.

Look up charts of the ""AA battery discharge curve"". The average AA battery only cranks out 1.5 volts for a moment, and goes down to about 1v very quickly. Like if a fire truck sprays 100 yards for two seconds then just starts to dribble rest out. There could be tons in the tank, you're just not getting any.

A 2200 or more battery stays hotter longer. The ""sweet spot"" is bigger. Assuming it's a good battery, which is why people talk about Sanyo and Eneloop and Powerex. Any good battery works, the brand is just a guide.

If you had a 10,000mah battery but it still discharged like a bitch, then you wouldn't notice any changes at all using your MFLB. This is why people talk about ""high drain"" batteries.",1496275527

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","You're basing your argument on *your* definition of what death is, which you're defining as that exact second that life ends. However, not all deaths end immediately. Sure, some folks die instantly in certain situations like accidents or car crashes. But some folks pass away slowly over days, weeks, months, or even years. During this time, they *know* they are going to die. Yes, they will lose all sensation once death happens. But you have to keep in mind the idea of what death represents to many people. 

Death is indeed natural, and a part of the life cycle. But many people come to enjoy the life they live. The idea of death is that it will take you away from the pleasures and joy from the current life and pass you into some unknown next stage, whether that includes an afterlife or not. Thus, it is realistic that some people will view death with some fear. We naturally fear the unknown, and so fearing something that 1) we have no idea what the aftermath is, and 2) will take us away from the good things we have come to rely on is scary for some. 

&gt; The harm of death for the one who dies has two potential components: (1) deprivation of future pleasant states of mind, and (2) derivative harm from harming those about whom one cares. It is irrational to fear death because it is irrational to fear either of the potential components of the harm of death listed above.

I think it's a little cold to say that it's irrational to fear harming those whom you care about. People come to care for others during their time alive and they want to avoid causing pain. There's nothing irrational about fearing that you'll hurt someone you love.",1496275527

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","Boldness points are a bit overtuned atm, with objective points undertuned and alturism being all out of wack. Obviously survival is gunna stay where it is eternally. Like just by playing the game and surviving you should be pipping every game. Hiding isn't directly rewarded but being chased and repairing is. A survivor who fixes two generators with an ally gets their BP filled up automatically. Repairing one generator, if you are good at checks, is around half your BP requirement for objectives. If you can smash away two, you are done or if you get one and maybe bits of another while repairing. Meanwhile if you engage the killer you get BP pretty quickly for chases.

It isn't actually too hard for a survivor to pip. And remember that just because you aren't going for the immediate rescue doesn't mean you aren't going for the rescue. Bluffing the punish is stronger in many ways than the punish, and as long as every survivor who is not going for the hook finishes a generator the killer is still screwed hardcore on points themselves with every remaining survivor kinda being set.

I agree with the core idea that the points are... not great now because they distort survivor priorities. That said I do like the fact that Alturism is SUPER hard to get.

I think the core problem is survivors asked for a lot of buffs to their ability to act with impunity that they got, which made all of the tension go away in repairing, which required a reduction in repair points. The fact that overt play is so low risk right now between things like BT and looping means that the thrill that being caught gave you when the game released is gone.

That is not to say I want every single killer nerf to be reverted. As someone who exclusively plays trapper when sitting killer side trapping the hook kiiiiinda distorted the value tradeoff of camping heavily for example. But survivors need more rewards for selfish and subtle play and overt play needs to be a high risk high reward thing rather than the high reward thing it... sorta... is...

Like its telling that alturistic point farming with BT is such a problem that people are complaining a lot about how people rush to unhook despite the killer being right there SOLELY for those 1.25k points. That shouldn't be happening, you should never see the killer and be encouraged to run straight at them to get hit for funsies.

A really great fix would be to flavor the score event for being near the killer but NOT in a chase (You DO get boldness points for hiding near the killer!) and make it more rewarding than it is. Hiding BP is actually really low, you can only get 250 from it from hiding for quite a while, and while nominally that is because a chase distracts the killer and because inactivity isn't supposed to be heavily rewarded, it is still really weird how low many BP rewards are, and it definitely could stand to have a higher cap. Maybe grant a secondary burst of points once the killer leaves, to prevent farming it but also to reward you for constantly slipping the killer as he checks a spot in anger repeatedly because he KNOWS you are nearby and you keep tapping that generator.

Like it cuts both ways of course, the initial hook's BP is pathetic, as is distraction BP for rescuing a killer by messing with auto aim despite the fact that is *harder* than a rescue and *riskier.* You get 1500 BP from a hook rescue and 1250 from a flashlight rescue despite the fact that a flashlight rescue is harder due to being very time sensitive(It was thought to be suicide before SWF and upgraded flashlights became meta! Flashlight was the joke item for a long time!) and it is better for the survivor! But if you want to maximize points your better off letting the survivor go on the hook and doing a BT rescue rather than *actually* rescuing the survivor. A lot of the BP rewards are encouraging dumb behavior like survivors trying to extend chases and killers wanting survivors to gen-tap.

But, like I said, it cuts both ways. The killer needs to be able to camp when the survivors reward it in order for killing to be fair like... at all. If someone rushes the hook, everyone loses the right to judge the killer because they made the *right tactical play* and doing anything else would have objectively been dramatic self harm. While it may be irritating, it is intentionally so, its supposed to represent the killer using the survivor as bait like a worm on a fishing *hook.*",1496275530

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Harry Potter World is lots of fun!!! I'm sure you'll make it happen :)

Some tips from someone whose been many times:

1. If you end up being pressed for time, take the single-riders line on the forbidden journey ride. You stay with your group up until you board the ride itself, and then each person is sort of... walled off from each other. No one is really able to see, hear, or interact with each other, so it doesn't matter who you're sitting next to. The regular line is neat, but can be over an hour sometimes. Single rider never takes more than ~15 minutes. 

2. If you have the money, get the park pass that will let you go to both parks. It's well worth the money, especially if you are planning to go multiple days. If you can only afford one, islands of adventure &gt; universal studios, but that's very much up to personal preference. If you get it, make sure you use the train to travel between the two!

3. Buy a wand! There's lots of neat interactive things you can do with it now, especially in Diagon Alley. So many pretty choices now too! When I bought mine, there was only ~5 to choose from. Makes you wonder.... but alas, the wand chooses the wizard, not the other way around :)

4. Three broomsticks &gt; Leaky Cauldron imo, but try to go to both if you can! They're my favorite  restaurants in both parks

5. Blue dragon &gt; red

6. Another tip if you are short on time: skip the flight of the hippogriff. It's fun, but easily the least impressive of all the Harry Potter World rides. Go for it if you have time though!

7. Somewhat off topic, but if you really want to make the most of this trip &amp; are a fan of scary stuff, go during halloween horror nights!! It's lots of fun and such a unique experience. The park will probably be a bit more crowded during this season, but it's not usually too bad since the actual event doesn't take place until night time. Regular park hours are cut a bit short because of this though. 

Sorry if this came off a bit preachy, I just wanted to share! Basically all of this is opinion, you could likely do the opposite of everything I've said and still have a blast :)

If you have any questions about the park, or just the Orlando area in general, feel free to ask! I've been living here for a while and must've gone to every theme park in the area dozens of times. 

Good luck with your dream!!",1496275530

I would also remind people that prior to the content id system, companies could still send DMCA takedown notices that youtube was legally compelled to follow (the DMCA predates youtube by almost a decade, and it seems that some people don't realise that it's an actual law), even if the video didn't contain an actual violation. There was a huge controversy surrounding the mass DMCA takedown filings that happened prior to the content id system, as quite often there would be videos that had no copyright infringing content at all.

I would also point out that the content id system's reaction is based on what the copyright holders send in and how they set up the system to react to infringing content. There are plenty of companies that don't have their content id settings set to ""automatic takedown"". ",1496275531

"Laptop","t5_2qikn","No problem! And as a hackintosh, that is essentially the case, but you'd run into driver issues if your laptop's hardware doesn't have Mac drivers. For instance, any AMD components you might have in the laptop simply cannot be run on macOS as there are no drivers for them on Mac. That said...you may not have to change to a new OS. Have you tried to perform a new clean install of Windows 10? A lot of times the issues of the OS slowing down on Windows 10 are due to updates slowing it down by creating needless bloat and a reformatting would help with that, or just a clean install of the OS. I'd try that first before anything else, and to do so, you can use the media creation tool found at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10. Alternatively, do you know if the laptop has a slot for an m.2 SSD? You might be able to try adding one of those in there and see what happens, and if that doesn't help or simply isin't an option forr you to do so, you might try replacing your storage drive you have now (I'm not sure if it's a hard drive but considering it's a former Win 8 machine I'm assuming its a mechanical drive) with an SSD and/or upgrading your RAM. If that's too pricey for you you can get a 2TB hybrid drive (I don't have this drive in here yet, but I do have a hybrid drive in my Dell Gaming 7567 laptop I'm on) from Seagate for $90 before shipping on Amazon (found at https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-2-5-Inch-Notebooks-ST2000LX001/dp/B01M1NHCZT/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495495459&amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;keywords=firecuda+2tb+2.5&amp;psc=1). I know this solution will mean spending more money but it sounds like a RAM deficency and/or a failing storage drive.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I matched with this tall and handsome man on tinder, after chatting on tinder for a week we exchanged numbers and kept on talking through SMS. Both of us were quite busy with life so we were cool with not meeting just yet. And then as I was about to move out of my apartment, he was about to move into a uni house with some mates. And as I had furnitures to get rid of, he just happen to need those exact furnitures, so we decided he was gonna come pick up at mine. Super nervous after talking for such long time and now finally meet at my place, I ran over to the bottle shop for some red wine, then lit up candles around in the apartment whilst dancing around to some sexy beats from Sade. A few glasses later, I get a text saying ""we're just outside"". Hold on, who's ""we""? I quickly blew out the lights and changed the music before running downstairs and open the door. And there he is. After almost 2 months of talking I realized I've been looking at the wrong guy who just happen to be in every single picture he has, and instead of this brown haired handsome fella with grey eyes and beard, I'm facing a 6,6 feet tall ginger accompanied by his buddy that looks like he's not even over 16yo. Trying to act all normal I give him a kiss on the cheek before letting them in and then talk business straight away. 20 minutes later furniture-Karl and his friend was off with my IKEA bookshelf and tv bench, and I was left $50 richer and with the lesson that one should always ask for one cheesy selfie before meeting up with tinderflames.

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","Updates - They were not as many yest. evening, and I used spray to water (since mites hate water) and when done there were only a couple. This morning, after rain, I could only find one. This is very odd, since there were too many to count when I took the photo. My first guess was that the plant is defending itself.

I do not think they are predatory mites, as they are sucking on the plant, and not attacking other mites. The googling I have done indicates they might be  Balaustium (http://bugguide.net/node/view/91443) based on the gap between 2nd and 3rd leg. Most of this genus are predatory, but the one that people seem to notice running around in circles on concrete are pollen feeders (https://www.whatsthatbug.com/2006/05/23/balaustium-mite/) and they are running around on flat surfaces looking for pollen.

But these really looked like they were sucking on the plant. I have not found any definitive information that they do or do not suck plants, but a couple sites hinted that they may sometimes bite people. I guess it is possible they were eating pollen stuck to the plant. Either way I do not think they are a problem.  This was also part of their behavior, as they were running around on the basil leaves and the pot and the wall when not on the tomato.

They are very hard to photograph. The photo above was taken with a Nikon SLR with 200mm cheapo Nikon zoom, as well as a macro adapter doubling the image size and a close focus adapter filter. It is dark because I had to wing it on the exposure (macro adapter = full manual) and it was sunny so the readout was useless. I went with underexposure to allow fast shutter, but maybe later I will use a tripod. 

Again, I don't think they are a problem, but now it is a challenge to take a good photo, and a curiosity. I have other problems, like the grape virus, the ume leaf curl, the borers that seem to like everything, the apricot aphids, the black spot on rose, etc. ",1496275533

"CRedit","t5_2qph1","I will start out by suggesting you pst this over on the [myFICO Credit Rebuilding forum](http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Rebuilding-Your-Credit/bd-p/rebuildingcredit)  - it is extremely active over there and many experts frequent the forums.

For optimal FICO scoring, you should carry three credit cards. Two should be reporting $0 and one should be reporting 9% or less (but not 0).

How many late payments did you have on your student loans? How long ago were the late payments made? As time goes by, the impact of the lares lessen though major lates (60, 90, 180) definitely have a bigger impact.

For the paid collections that are still on your credit report, try sending a Goodwill request to request they delete. This is different than a dispute - you aren't disputing the validity of the debt but you explain your circumstances and request a deletion. I have had success with this and have had collections deleted and even had a 30 Day Late removed from my car loan.

Also, make sure you are pulling your actual 3 credit reports from annualcreditreport.com. Often times you will see things on one report which aren't on the others.

As far as suggestions for a 3rd credit card, I would definitely try to join Navy Federal Credit Union and get one of their cards. They are notoriously very generous with their credit limits for their members. I had a 640 FICO score and was instantly approved for a $24k credit card when my highest limit before that was $1,000 (my income had a big influence on this to be honest but I was only expecting a $2k limit and was shocked by getting 10x that).

If you aren't a current/former member of the military, you can still join if any member of your family was in the military (or anyone that lives in your home). I was able to join because my grandfather was in the Army",1496275534

"Morrowind","t5_2r9nv","This depends on the genre of game and how much multi-player there is usually. 

If it's a series that is heavily single player and heavily story based, then a successful formula means change is bad. Morrowind/Elder Scrolls 1-3 fans tend to fall into this camp. Oblivion made a few improvements on stuff in Morrowind, but for the most part streamlined too much and was just prettier. Skyrim is on the same trend line. But this camp is also the home of *most* RPGs. I mean, check out the Final Fantasy series for one example - apparently somewhere between Final Fantasy 4 - 9 the best game was made and everything is terrible after that game. 

But go to a heavily multiplayer focused game and you'll see (usually) just the opposite trend. Unless the game started with perfect balance (and I don't think any game ever does) more sequels or updates or DLC is usually relished by the community because it can address balance issues (key word being ""can"" as it can also unbalance everything too). And also since there's usually a lot more repetition in the multiplayer experience (you'll fight the same people/archetypes all the time in a Fighting Game for example, or run into people using the same type of meta builds in an MMO PvP arena) the new content of a sequel/expansion is much more greedily desired. In these types of games, usually old content is looked as ""last gen"" and it's always about the latest and newest meta.

(Of course there are exceptions, like Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which was spat upon by the community after Melee, but that's mostly due to the speed being turned down and the tripping mechanic)

Funnily enough, it's games that tend to find a balance between MP and SP that usually don't run into the issues of either ""the older games did it better"" or ""newest games are always better."" 

Like Dark Souls for example. Pretty much each game in that series found its niche that people liked, and all of them seem to be enjoyed in roughly equal amounts on average with few people saying any one game in it is the obvious ""best"" in the series. Each game has its detractors and its fans.",1496275535

This is what I want. Either him and Aphra hunting down jedi relics or the NEU versions of the Jedi Academy series with Luke and his roaming school looking for jedi secrets, fighting aliens/dark jedi/ imperial warlords in the unkown regions, and just learning more about hte force. Also it would be a good way to see Kylo grow up. 

&gt;The Old Republic - I think a TV show would be a great place to start bringing the Old Republic back into canon. It can be a totally new story, a variation of something like KOTOR, anything.

Well of course it wont be a straight rip of the game. I really think people need to start realizing that. So far with the Aphra comic and some other things they seem to be heading for the Tales of the Jedi type era. But even then I doubt they will take much from it either.

It's hard to tell whether the evidence gathered of extraterrestrial visitation is conclusive or if further observation is needed, but I'm actually a pretty huge fan of the idea that our planet and our thousands of civilizations may have even been shaped by extraterrestrial life. Carvings on ancient structures, ancient myths about pantheons and armies of gods and demigods coming and giving gifts of fire and life, sudden and unexplained events in our evolutionary timeline...perhaps a violation of the Prime Directive? Maybe aliens came and nuked the fuck out of the dinosaurs so they could seed the growth of life forms that more resembled them.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","You're trying so hard to design a system that doesn't work that it's hard to tell what you're even talking about sometimes.

&gt; Sure it is.

There are two parts of authentication.  One is making sure someone doesn't enter a fake ID or someone else's ID into their iPhone.  This is *not* a state inter-compatibility issue.

The second is making sure that an ID that is submitted is authenticated as valid.  This exists today with RealID with the only difference being the magnetic stripe versus NFC, but once the reader has the information, the backend process could be the same (or better).

&gt; Do you think each state is going to pay money to build a backend so that their DMV database can authenticate using Apple's infrastructure?

For issuing the licenses?  3 states are already testing such systems and others are evaluating them.

&gt; Banks (or whoever issues the credit card) do it because they make money. Apple does it because they get a slice. What's the incentive for DMVs to do it. 

It's likely to be cheaper for them to do authentication than it is to print licenses, and fees can be assigned to pay, just like the DMV in most states doesn't just print IDs for free.

&gt; Look at how much friction there is in the US at retailers actually putting in NFC readers? It's still huge.

No it's not... unless you were expecting an overnight change, which I certainly wasn't and neither am I here with this.  I just don't want to see a ""let's never do this, because the transition will take too long"" and then we just never have a system in place wherein if we simply make sure the specs are in place moving forward, we could transition in just a few years (or sooner).

&gt; Who's going to pay the police to buy compatible readers? Still plenty of police that don't have in-car terminals..

Police are buying readers.  They're replacing old readers.  Let's make sure they're buying readers that have the necessary specs in place.

&gt; Unless Apple is willing to foot the bill for the benefit of their owners and I can't see that happening it's a good idea but never going to happen. 

It's already happening.  Trials are taking place in 3 states and evaluations in others.",1496275541

Battling pokemon is a core aspect of gameplay, and is absolutely terrible currently in pokemon go. There are so so many issues with gyms - issues like spoofing, botting, shaving, spot sniping, death loop bug, blissey (and other typical gym mon) stacking, low level (under 30) players having virtually no chance at consistent gym play, gym stagnation, having no limit to the number of gym someone can hold, and even some people would argue bubble stratting is an issue. Very few players get real enjoyment out of gym play with how many problems the current meta has.  I do think your ideas are fine and would probably even be fun, but I also think implementing them would probably overload servers since historically this game has faced a lot server limit issues, and that the main problem with the game right now is that the gym system just doesn't work at all, period.

Let me tell you a story from when I was a little nice kid, .., way before I ever heard about poker and hustling.

You know, my grandfather was an egg farmer. I used to candle eggs at his farm.
You hold an egg up to the light of a candle and, you look for imperfections. The first time I did it he told me to put all the eggs that were cracked or flawed into a bucket for the bakery. And, he came back an hour later..., and there were 300 eggs
in the bakery bucket.

He asked me what the hell I was doing..., (lol) ... but I found a flaw
in every single one of them. You know, thin places in the shell and, fine hairline cracks.

**You look closely enough you'll find everything has a weak spot  where it can break, sooner or later**

"wow","t5_2qio8","I'd honestly suggest to make a Trial Character (assuming you have Legion) and set up your bars on it once all skills are unlocked after the mini tutorial. From there, you mostly have all your abilities minus one provided by most artifacts. It lets you set up Action Bars and find out what's more/less useful. :)

That said, getting to max level will still be your best bet to really get to know your UI and find which Action Bars might be more/less useful. Especially on healers, I typically remove any healing spells that don't have a cooldown/proc from my Action Bars since they're already set up on Vuhdo. I'm also not a fan of the bars off the right side either. Here's my [old UI](http://i.imgur.com/7aNmcWI.jpg) for reference. I've actually just [re-done it](http://i.imgur.com/zfzCPBO.jpg) starting last weekend and it's still a bit of a WIP especially in the Vuhdo area and consumables on my bars though.

I also try to set up my bars fairly similarly across characters, 6 will always be my interrupt, 5 is always an AoE, 4 is a short cooldown ability, 123 are my main abilities, ""="" is a movement one. I also use a 12-buttons mouse so yeah, muscle memory helps. :P",1496275542
"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","If you don't get a lot of calls from unknown numbers then you can usually turn off all notifications from anyone who isn't in your phone book. That is built in to most smart phones. But if you do sometimes get calls from people you don't know (maybe you use your phone for work and customers can call you) that may not be a good solution. On my iPhone I set it up so that I don't get any notification when calls from unknown numbers come in. Basically, everyone in my contacts will cause my phone to ring/buzz but it's silent from anyone else (but I still see the messages/missed calls). If you get texts/calls from the same number you can ""ban"" or ""black list"" it from your phone; usually through the built-in settings.

Depending on your phone carrier you may be able to report the numbers to them and they can ban them from harassing their customers. Technically, even if someone did sign you up for some sort of mailing list you have to confirm your subscription before anyone can send you robo-texts (I get them all the time from certain stores) and if you didn't confirm then who ever is sending is in violation of the law.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You don't understand what Atheism is. You and I are both atheists by the way. You are atheist to all the other theist claims except for Christianity which you believe to be true. 

Atheism isn't a positive claim that a god doesn't exist. If I claimed a god doesn't exist I'd have to provide evidence of something not existing which to my understanding is impossible. I would have a burden of proof if I make a claim. How do you provide evidence fairies and Bigfoot don't exist? There are people who believe they do. There are people who claim they have seen fairies and Bigfoot. I can't provide positive proof of a negative. I'm sure you would agree you can't prove fairies, Bigfoot, or even aliens don't exist. Now aliens may in fact exist. There could be tiny microscopic bacteria living on another planet in the universe. But we don't have evidence of it yet. The time to believe extraordinary things is when you have evidence, not the other way around. 

So, you make a theistic positive claim that your version of a god exists. My stance on your theistic claim and so far all other theistic claims for other religions is that none of these theistic claims meet their burden of proof to provide sufficient evidence for me to believe. That's not a cop out, it's just how the laws of logic work to my understanding. 

Now we can have a discussion about why I think your evidence is insufficient. And maybe along the way I could learn some things and maybe my stance could change on some things. However for that to happen I'd need you to stop talking to me in such an  aggressive tone, because it's off putting and inefficient to discussion. I'm a pretty good guy.

In case you don't have time or don't want to read everything in detail, here's a 

**TL;DR: Since 85°C is referred to as max. ambient temp, my conclusion was that they mentioned it to create a guideline to what delta to tjmax these controllers at least need to function within specification. A bit below the table there's again 125°C mentioned as max. operating junction temperature. So our temps should be fine for daily use.**

______________________________


I think the 85°C ambient is more of a guideline to not exceed maximum temperature ratings for safe operation. It then says that the values provided in the table are median values at 25°C ambient.

Running those controllers at 85°C ambient leaves room for 40°K delta to 125°C.
This way they're kind of saying you can run these at up to 85°C and still have enough room for them to operate safely with that 40°K margin until it exceeds its absolute maximum rating.


The following is only speculation from my part, but if proper cooling was ensured one could probably run them at 90°C or 100°C as long as they didn't exceed it's TJMax.

It's for sure a good idea to keep them cool. But as I'm only seeing ~67°C during mixed workload operation in my case, I don't think I have any need to act.

Nevertheless, I've thought about how I would solve that problem. Since the K4 already seems to have some kind of VRM heatsinks I'd probably just try to stick a small 40mm fan there, which should already cool them down by a considerable amount since I have pretty much zero VRM cooling at the moment.

____________________

By the way since we're talking about temperatures, if I may ask, what CPU load temps do you get when stress testing?

I have a NH-U14s and I feel like I didn't tighten the screws enough on the cooler, since I've read about people achieving lower temps than mine (70°C at 1.244VCore and Prime95 with ~800RPM fan speed) with the stock cooler (62,65,68°C on 1.3V). I'm away from home so I can't check my mounting, but the air coming from the cooler was always warm and the cooler felt right to the touch comparing the temp readings. Judging from my past builds, everything ""seemed"" alright at least.

However, what I've read has made me worried. I get about 10°K difference at max between the ""CPU"" reading from the motherboard and the ""Tdie/Tcl"" reading from the CPU in HWInfo64.

Now, single payer...

Financed via taxes or some semblance thereof.  That brings up the problem with all government spending of the ""Excess Burden of Taxation"" (look it up on wikipedia for details), which is the negative economic consequences deriving from the misallocation of incentives a tax system necessarily imposes.  In the US that is about 75% on additional spending.  So increase government health care spending by $4 billion and the economy finds itself short not only $4 billion but an additional $3 billion through production that would have taken place but now does not.  

So, doing ANYTHING through government is necessarily less efficient than doing it through the free market.

"HomeServer","t5_2sxqm","&gt; First of all, will I have enough memory to use dedup on this system? I know the recommended is 5GB per TB, which leaves me with 6GB free RAM.

That is a rough rule of thumb.  The actual memory required to store the deduplication tables is the total number of unique blocks in your pool (or deduplicated datasets) times the size of the in-memory DDT entries (usually 320 bytes).

Fortunately, we can directly simulate deduplication with existing data in ZFS by using `zdb -S &lt;poolname&gt;`

    # zdb -S zones
    Simulated DDT histogram:

    ...
       512        2   1.50K   1.50K   1.50K    1.55K   1.25M   1.25M   1.25M

    dedup = 3.47, compress = 1.95, copies = 1.00, dedup * compress / copies = 6.77

In the above example, 19.8G of uncompressed (10.1G compressed) data occupying 261K unique blocks which would consume ~83M of memory for a savings of 7G (10.1G - 2.92G) on disk.  These results are due to the highly duplicated data that this pool is currently handling.

Here's another example:

    # zdb -S zones
    Simulated DDT histogram:

    bucket              allocated                       referenced

     Total    18.3M   1.42T   1.35T   1.35T    20.8M   1.60T   1.50T   1.50T

    dedup = 1.11, compress = 1.07, copies = 1.00, dedup * compress / copies = 1.18

Here we have 1.6T of uncompressed (1.5T compressed) data occupying 18.3M unique blocks which would consume ~5856M of memory for a savings of 150G on disk.  This is not nearly as worthwhile as the previous example.

Deduplication isn't officially recommended unless your dedup ratio exceeds 2.0, and in most cases, isn't too different from the advantages gained by compressing all data written to the disks (with lz4), whereas compression has none of the disadvantages associated with deduplication.

&gt; Also, if I decide that deduplication isn't working for me, how easy is it to disable and ""re-duplicate"" the data to the way it was before?

Yes and no.  Deduplication can be turned on and off at will on a ZFS dataset, but the DDT will only be added to/updated on write, so you will need to completely copy data on to or off of the pool for it to be fully affected by the dedup setting.

Realistically, deduplication will only potentially help you when dealing with highly repeated data like container root file systems (Solaris Zone, FreeBSD Jail, Linux Open VZ).  It will be completely worthless when dealing with large collections of ""Linux ISOs"" (the /r/DataHorder definition) as those tend to contain very little duplicated data relative to their total size.",1496275545

I'd assume then that even though he loses himself to the wolf post-transformation, he could weaponise himself by locking himself in a room with whoever he wants to fuck up and then wolf out.

But honestly, I'd go with my girl Tara on this one. I think her powers are underestimated and understated, and I think she holds back because she doesn't feel a need to pursue power the way Willow does. I think her relationship with magic is more about exploring her connection to the world and spirituality and inner harmony and blah blah blah. But none of that means that if she somehow went over the edge she wouldn't be capable of fucking someone up. Maybe not Dark Willow levels, but, come on. We're talking a ranged mage versus a melee glass cannon. My money's always on the mage, especially coz we already know she can levitate.

If this is an Oz vs Tara fight and for some reason they're equally committed to killing each other, I'm going with Tara. Oz has zero mental acuity as a wolf (probably like a -5). All Tara would have to do is levitate or hit him with a sleep spell (or both), then conjure a knife and stab his face off. If it's Tara or Oz vs Unknown Evil, that's less clear, but still going with Tara.

Edit to say: If this is Tara or Oz vs Willow though, they both lose, no question. Later-season Willow would toast them like tater tots.",1496275546

just like  a 45 yr old car, most parts will not be available from a dealership.   some parts will be available, but most won't.  dont expect you can walk into the suzuki dealership and buy a new gas tank. I wouldn't expect to walk into a ford dealership and expect I could buy a 1973 Ford falcon XB GT hood.  
  
   
that being said, parts availability is very good. Suzuki sold a lot of them, so parts bikes and used parts are readily available.   


The suzuki gt750 is by no means ""an absolute death trap"" or ""original widow maker"". those nicknames were usually reserved for the kawasaki H2(750) and and sometimes the H1 (500).    the water buffalo is much tamer.  

the gt750 (water buffalo/kettle-liquid cooled)) is a different bike altogether. it handles well, and has a wide power band unlike the H1/H2.  it is a heavy bike (500lbs or so), and pulls well at low RPMs, unlike most/all big(and little) 2 strokes.   
it's points ignition, not CDI.   

 I don't know about the Australian imports, but if it is a GT750J its a 1972. build date may be 1971, but it was sold (at least in the US) as a 1972.


the gt750 is a surprisingly comfortable rider. the 4LS brakes on the 72 can be both grabby and inefficient at the same time. 


stock shocks on all bikes of the era were mostly crap, a set of Hagons would work well, and not break the bank. Ikon shocks (KONI) are great shocks made in Australia they are more money.

"gwent","t5_384zi","I disagree with you on most of those points. 

1. Weather by itself isn't broken, play it yourself and you will see. You are making a very low tempo play that an enemy can clear with one card and the enemy can clear AND gain tempo from (NG has the standard bearer, NR the scout etc.. and the Mages exist in every faction that come with tempo+other options+clear sky), and almost all top rank decks run these cards + at least one clear sky since the card is simply good. Weather decks are good now, but not above other strong Archtypes at the moment. The only problematic weather is the gold weather because if you don't have an answer to it you are kind of fucked and since row stacking seems to be one of the best ways to counter it, it severely limits deck building options.

2. That is simply not true, bronzes are the backbone of your deck, silvers are your situational/combo cards and the golds are power plays/swings that are nice, but the synergy of good decks makes it very possible that a no gold hand can win if they play their cards right. Some cards are to be honest a bit unpleasant, like YenCon who is very good in long rounds, but most of the golds don't have such a design problem. 

3. I agree, it looks like an interface for a mobile game with very amazing artwork.

4. Keywords are in my opinion a move in the right direction, and the way they implemented the explanations for keywords in the UI is perfect. Keywords let a player who has played a bit more to very quickly read and understand what the card does, and let new players learn quicker since it simplifies the cards once you know the keywords.

5. I doubt that they will remove weather, I don't think it's a toxic mechanic, but it might see another iteration before they decide what's the best, I personally like the weather. The passives were hard to balance, but the worst part is that it limits the card design opportunities. You cannot make a card that synergizes too well with the passive, therefore you gotta change the design for a concept that would've worked if the passives didn't exist. This way they can include the old passives into the archtypes like they did and they have full creative freedom to make new archtypes that can work without passives without them having suboptimal usage of the said passives.",1496275549

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","Take a look at Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen

Big open world rpg, 9 different classes, there's the basic strider (range), Mage, fighter, then upon reaching the first town you can change into advanced versions called ranged, sorcerer and warrior. Then also in the first town there are 3 hybrid classes, assassin (melee/range), mystic knight (melee/magic) and magick archer (range/magic)

All the classes feel pretty unique with different weapon types and a large variety of skills, buffs and more. If you're not focusssd on min-maxing you can switch classes at any point and honestly min maxing isn't that necessary. Your character can range from lvl 1-200

You can climb on pretty much every enemy and even get carried away by a griffin for example if you're on it or it gets you in its talons. All enemies have elemental reactions and the game world isn't scaled to your player so it's very easy to wander into the wrong place and be fighting dangerous foes.

You probably won't be able to do every quest on your first run and there's a lot of replay ability, including an expansive end game with set dungeons, and the expansion adds an entire new dungeon area to the game that adds much difficulty.

Control yourself and a custom made Ai companion, then hire 2 more Ai controlled companions from an online hub utilising other people's custom made Ai companions. Yours can even be hired and come back to you with experience, knowledge of new areas and enemies if you haven't faced them or they were defeated in certain ways and then have your companions apply their knowledge during the battle to help you out!

for a little background, i had a MC last may 2016, and when my OB did an ultrasound to see that it all passed through, she discovered what could be a uterine septum, which is basically muscle tissue coming down from the top of my uterus, basically splitting my uterus into two sides. a more intensive ultrasound found that it was large enough that i needed laparoscopic surgery to shave it down. if the egg had implanted on the septum, that could've been the reason for my MC. too bad we are not always able to have a 100% reason why MC occurred! :(

a uterine septum supposedly occurs in 1% of women...had to get the surgery to keep it from affecting our future chances. had a successful uterine septum surgery in august 2016 and have been having trouble conceiving since we were cleared to start TTC last october. 

***the positive news my doctor told me yesterday was that typically when women have an HSG test, they are able to conceive soon after, since the fluids used in the test essentially clear the path for the semen to reach the egg.***
From WebMD: ""An HSG is done mainly for women who are having a hard time getting pregnant. Some studies show that this test may help a woman's chance of becoming pregnant. That is because the dye may remove the mucus plugs, straighten the fallopian tubes, and break through thin scar tissue.""

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Bear with me, because I'm going to start with global economics. The Great Depression impacted not just the US, but countries spread across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa. This heavily covered impacted trade and resulted in high tariffs and a 30% reduction in global trade between 1929 and 1939.

The political results were many. Germany and Italy fell under fascist rule. Argentina had a military dictatorship. Other countries also experience political upheavals. Because countries were unable to purchase raw materials and commodities such as coffee, rubber and tin, export revenue dropped significantly. Unemployment rates skyrocketed, the effect of which was civil unrest. That is the condition that enabled the takeover by dictators, the Nazis and others.

Let's look at Germany. Hitler's plan was to repair and bolster the German economy by getting rid of unions and replacing them with industrial cartels ([more about cartels in this book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Hell_s_Cartel.html?id=rKMTAQAAIAAJ). He also stepped up militarization, which significantly lowered unemployment and bolstered the military.

Italy's Mussolini gained strength as a result of the unrest although his government was already in power.

Japan invaded Manchuria after becoming militarized during the 30s, a move that gave Japan access to China's resources as well as their coastline.

Now, we must consider Stalin and the USSR. Stalin's 5-year plan was underway in 1928 and was a policy of collectivism where peasant farmers basically gave their agricultural products to the government for pennies. He also stepped up industrialization. During the depression, millions were killed or sent to Siberian camps which further tightened Stalin's grip over the population and forced conformity to his plan.

In Europe and the Canada, welfare capitalism became the standard and the government took responsibility for removing the risks of bankruptcy and unemployment by attempting equal distribution of wealth and power.

In the US, the political climate changed significantly, giving the support of ethnic groups in cities to interventionist politics. Programs such as pensions, unemployment compensation and welfare payments were developed. The FDIC was established to protect bank deposits and the stock market was more closely regulated than before.

Overall, the global political climate changed quite significantly during the Great Depression in response to the crashes economies of countries around the world.

&gt;Having access to fireball

I'm specifically referring to preparation. As I said I'm fine with Weave Focus giving all spells on a spell list including fireball.  I think preparation needs to be reworked.  A constantly on penalty is never fun for a player.  Make it an honest choice.  Let them spend a ranger point to gain the resistance for 10 minutes, afterwards they get a level of exhaustion until they finish a long rest.  That way its a choice they make not an infliction, plus it would allow them to burn multiple points to stack damage resistances but would bring them close to death by exhaustion.

&gt; surprised you think it lacks late game

Mostly i think the late games of a lot of 5e classes are pretty bland.  Ranger is literally just a flat bonus to damage as a capstone.  its bland, it works but isn't interesting.  That's why I liked the idea of introductions like Ambuscade in UA, but they just had to front load them into the first half of the class.  Basic ability upgrades aren't exciting, nor are flat damage boosts, and blank levels are particularly boring.  There isn't much I can suggest that fits with the themes of how you've built the class. The damage curve is on the higher side so any damage abilities will make it OP.  Likewise you've pushed a lot of the stealth and non-combat abilities on the class early on, just like WotC did, so there isn't really a lot there to add. Ambush tactics, skirmishing, primeval senses, natural healing or dirty tricks would seem tacked on at this late a level. Not sure there is much you can do to address it. Frankly not sure you should, its your homebrew, if you're happy run with it.

&gt; what would you be gaining

In order? Superior Damage, high tracking efficiency, earlier evasion and over all better stealth, better hit points and AC, small but efficient spellcasting.   

Basically a very efficient ranged assassin.  Yes some of the abilities double up but remember most of the time the ranger gets the ability after the rogue so it would be pretty easy to jump ship before you get a duplicate.  And beyond that a magical damage boost and a mundane damage boost added onto sneak attack damage could very well be worth it.  plus you get a second attack that the rogue doesn't usually get. Use Expertise on Stealth to make the sneakiest class more sneaky is good and if you can stick it out to vanish you have the improvement of being immune to magical senses.  Using ranger points to gain temporary favored terrains means you'll never be slowed by difficult terrain wherever you are and gaining advantage on tracking any assassination target presents huge advantages.  If you don't want to hunters mark everything coupling lightning arrow with sneak attack is very good damage.",1496275551

If I'm playing with a quad and we drop into a high loot zone it's more like 80-90% chance someone is going to get an smg suppresor and 50/50 someone finds an AR or sniper suppressor.

What those people do then dictates what happens in the future, sort of like having everything go in the right order to get the right outcome. Person A has to do 1, 2, and 3 by say May 1950, for the right outcome, while if Person B does 2, 3, and 4 by 1955, you get something different. That lets him possibly predict what will happen in the future, like with the film of the A-bomb in San Francisco, which I think was from an alternate future. I was never sure if there were future worlds shown in the films or not. 

Then he uses those clues to redirect things to wherever he feels they should go. But I believe that's also what Hitler is doing with his own films. That's how the Reich won the war and dominated that world, with him viewing the films and moving the pieces appropriately to give the Nazis the advantage/win.

If Mattel released a Barbie that was set up by default to charge huge amounts of real money every 15 minutes while your child played with it they would get sued too.

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","i was just looking at that vs minimum units.

Minimum unit with 2 Arquebuses and an omnispex is 102 points for 5 guys with 2 heavy rifle shots.  Less throw away guys to keep the guns safe but more guns per point ratio.
510 points would give me 5 units with a total of 10 arquebuses proividing on average 5 hits without relying on canicles.  Thats not a bad starting point for anti heavy infantry, character, and somewhat vehicle while still having 15 shots that are good vs horde infantry at 30 inches.

Lets assume vs a mean character at T5 with a 2+ save and a 4+ invulnerable and assume we are using the reroll 1's canicle.

10 shots would produce (rounding) 3 failed saves.  This would average 6 wounds with a 50/50 chance of an additional mortal wound. so 50/50 odds of 1 rounding a 7 wound character and getting rid of the buff bubble he probably has.",1496275557

Well you can push better with your team defending the golem and the enemy not stopping you. They reworked some maps to make them less snowbally because the objectives like golem and the punishers had so much value at such an early time in the game. 

Just focus on you helping your team and if you can do both such as push and help get objective then do it. There is also a mute button if they are toxic and flaming. ",1496275559

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Here's  the actual guidelines 

-----What to do----

If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.


-----What not to do----

Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.

Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it. Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

Here in New Zealand we do have a similar tax break called Working for Families though - where basically lower income families with children pay less tax. 

But - I would argue that tax credits aren't the problem I'm seeking to address. I'm not seeking seeking to reduce the birthrate outright - I'm seeking to reduce the number of children being born in scenarios where their parents are unable to give them good socialization or education. 

In those scenarios I don't think people are responding to 'I'll get a $1000 tax credit for having a child' because that's long term in the future decision making. The idea with  a $50 incentive is that it's an _immediate_ incentive. ",1496275560

Especially when they realize that cross-fusion is not only viable, but also superior as well? No amount of Homeworld soldier could ever deal with that and they will be overwhelmed quickly.

So yes. The only real explanation about the corruption song is that it was a last resort button.

I had an idea for a possible sequel where it is explained that the 2nd Conjunction at the end of W3 caused a dramatic increase in the number of monsters as well as reviving previously extinct species and introducing monsters never seen before.  Because of this new Witcher schools are opened and a new generation is trained.

There are 2 MAJOR problems with this however.  In the books it is explained that the secrets to creating new Witchers are lost forever.  When Kaer Morhen was attacked the secrets were lost and no living mage or Witcher knows them.  The other problem is that one of the major themes of the Witcher stories is how the Witchers themselves are becoming obsolete and are slowly dying out.

On the other hand, even with dysphoria being a terrible thing, I feel like getting rid of it should be my decision. I don't want my parents or a doctor to be making that decision for me. Of course I trust that they have my best interests in mind but people do some terrible things with their child's best interests in mind. Look at the prevalence of homosexual conversion therapy for just one example. 

I think CRISPR and its like can be great for preventing objectively terrible diseases that would prevent someone from living their life or be carried to term. But when it comes to things like being trans or being gay I think it would be terrible to make that decision for someone else. Because you don't know how it'll affect their life for better or for worse. 

I just think that there are some things that we shouldn't mess with and the biological factors that help determine one's personality are one of those things. I'm not a particularly religious person but I feel as if we're thinking of playing God when this concept is brought up.

It seems like he's frustrated with the boredom that he is facing in school.  This is presenting as behavioral problems.  Unfortunately, I see this happen with many gifted students.  Given that you say the family is low income, I might suggest directing him towards an independent home project.  Figure out what he's interested in and turn it into a long term project.  It could be a research project, a community project, an engineering project, etc.  He could teach himself to code if he's interested in computers.  He could build a robot using Arduino programming.  I would also recommend finding a silent project/activity that he can do in his spare time at school.  He probably spends a large portion of the school day waiting for other students to finish their work.  This can be exasperating.  Reading is a good silent activity -- he can read about anything that interests him.  Alternatively, many gifted children enjoy logic puzzles.  This is a blog that I wrote about my own frustrations in school:  http://resources.njgifted.org/purely-gifted/go-ahead-label-me  You'll also find free downloadable activities and other resources there.

Edit
This is my opinion and I'll try include some reasons for why that can still b good or bad

From worst to best: ( I've only used sinon and asuna so this could b way off)

Silica - decent with 8 hits ss3
Dagger so quick attacks
Appears to more a very small aoe
Kinda long ss3

Sinon- decent to finish bosses
Spammable ss3
Only 4 hits 
Can't party
Quick ss3

Yuuki- mace therefore slow even with the speed boost
Gotta say the ss3 is pretty good though as its ranged and not a single line of sight 
Aoe doesn't seem pretty big 
Quick ss3

Leafa - teleports behind the enemy so good
Sometimes to close to enemy so bad 😅
High hits
Kinda long ss3

Alice - huge aoe
High hits ss3
Kinda long ss3. Not too bad though 

Asuna - kinda big aoe
High hits ss3
Finishes ss3 behind enemy. 
Very fast ss3

"abdiscussion","t5_3jrn1","I've reacted to three products so far, but all with the exact same symptoms. First my skin gets mildly itchy on my cheeks, and then my forehead. If I don't get the product washed off quickly enough, the itching becomes severe and my skin starts flushing and red and blotchy. Oddly enough, my right cheek is by far the most sensitive part of my skin - my left cheek reacts much more slowly, if at all. The symptoms are much, much worse if I accidentally layer an occlusive over a trouble product - I made the mistake of sealing olive oil-containing products in with Vaseline a couple times, and it was insane. I had to wash my face multiple times and my skin ended up being red for several days.

Sometimes I wonder if my reactions are related at all to my lupus. I never reacted to any skincare products prior to developing the disease, and my skin has never been sensitive or prone to redness before. Plus the symptoms are very similar to what I get when I eat an inflammatory food or something I'm allergic to. And of course, I find the fact that the right side of my face reacts so much more strongly troubling, as the right side of my body is also where my lupus-related joint and muscle pain is worst. Like, damn, it wasn't enough for lupus to make things like sitting and walking painful - it also has to make my skin act weird? Diseases are are so bizarre.

So basically she picked 16 different dresses for me to try (all around $3,000 when I said that my very very top would be $2,000) 

And I strongly agree the fat comment was just out of line. Like no one should talk to someone else like that. Like you never know how badly it can hit someone.

Like I fought an eating disorder in high school. It was bad, it took a very long time for me to get to be okay with myself and it hit hard and was a bitch and a half not to fall back into Binge and Purge or just plain not eating. And honestly if it wasn't for my FH idk if I would have taken it as well as I did. Like people are complex beings you can't just go around being an asshole

The comparison of tank DPS to that of dedicated DPS and the enmity generated by healers is important because it will determine how often we're in tank stance and how long we have to spend there, but the comparison that will matter for the purpose of *comparing the tanks* is, well, how they compare to each other.

It's far too soon to say for certain, but my feeling based on what we've seen so far is that all three tanks will be about the same, DPS-wise, but that warrior will still have the edge (although by a much smaller margin).

Response from u/HaohKenryuZarc:

&gt;Of course it'll be even more funny when you goddamn traitors show Fake Outrage again like you did with Kathy Griffin. Of course I can't expect children like yourself will achieve much in life

You're clearly suggesting that any Trump support that questions the MSM narrative is a child, which itself implies that every Trump supporter is a child because all Trump supporter questions the MSM narrative.

Any achievement is something to be proud of, don't sell yourself short. And the things that you listed above are themselves something to be proud of.

I don't know if anyone pointed this out or not but we actually might now batches before they are leaked now.

So it's quite possible the next time a coliseum is released before sugo characters are announced it will say who is being boosted and it will let us know whats to come. Although I don't know if this will happen with a brand new batch of characters.

Still, the way I do it on my Taranis is I set thresholds that I monitor and if I get below a threshold for a set amount of time &gt; 5s, then I set an alert.  It really depends on how you fly though. Sag will always be the worst when you do punch outs so you should take that into consideration when setting up your alerts.

Also, don't underestimate the value of a signal strength alert. It's saved me from losing my quad a couple of times. A loose or damaged antenna can result in shortened range and an alert telling you that the signal has dropped to a low level before it goes out can be invaluable.",1496275577

I joined the navy, and went all over the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea. If you don't like the idea of combat, there are hundreds of jobs that will keep you out of harm's way (in fact, must jobs are non combat or support jobs) you can learn a skill that may interest you and carry you through life, or, in my case, I learned that I'd rather work with my mind than my hands.

The Spirit is a light, a guide and a comfort, correct? Do you have kids? My kids break my rules all the time. I put them in time out. But I never withdraw from them and I'd without doubt NEVER take away light and comfort from them.

* Satan decides to do better. He makes Job very ill and covers his entire body in painful boils.
* Job practically thanks God for the privilege.
* Job's wife: ""God really sucks, huh?""
* Job: ""Don't be stupid. God is allowed to do this. I must deserve it for some reason. Sorry God.""
* Job tells his friends (who don't recognize his hideous face anymore) that he would like to die, but God won't allow it.
* Job: ""I wish I was never born.""

"europe","t5_2qh4j","It's a rather muddy and extremely political topic. Ukraine as a state in the modern understanding didn't exist until the Russian Revolution of 1917 when not one but two Ukraines were declared. Before that, the territories of modern-day Ukraine have always been parts of Russia, Poland-Lithuania and the Ottoman Empire. Even before that, they all were part of Kievan Rus, which fell apart on its own (arguably with some help of the various hordes). Right now in Ukraine it's popular to remember that Kievan Rus was the original country in this spot, and this means that Ukraine existed before Russia and Russia was, in a way, created by Ukraine. Others argue that it would be incorrect, because back then the concepts of neither Russia nor Ukraine existed. It's like linking modern Italy to the Roman Empire: it kinda makes some degree of sense, but way too much happened in between to make the link meaningful in any way when discussing modern day.

As someone else already mentioned, it's getting even more complicated when trying to translate the debate into English since both Russian and Ukrainian languages have two separate words: ""russky"" and ""rossiysky"". Both are translated as ""Russian"", but the former is a much wider term pertaining to the overall culture, language and ethnicity and is an adjective derived from ""Rus"" (as in Kievan Rus), while the latter means something related to the nation of Russia, derived from ""Rossiya"", which is, well, Russia.",1496275585

Those kind of fans are clearly in the minority and probably have some other personality issues outside of their wrestling fandom. 

I'm a 30 year old guy with a career, a home and a girlfriend. I've been watching wrestling since I was old enough to remember. My friends and I hang out, grill and drink beer during PPV's. We have debates about wrestling and who we like or don't like but I'm the only one that posts on wrestling boards and watches stuff outside of WWE. I guess that would make me the smark of the group, yet when I go to shows (once every few years) I kind of sit quietly and watch, occasionally cheering or booing but mostly just enjoying the show. There's always one guy that embarrasses me at these shows by being obnoxious. 

I'm not sure what my point is now, but I guess I just find stereotypes annoying. I definitely find the ""parents basement"" thing annoying because it's not original or even close to accurate. You have dumb fucks on Twitter and random dumb fucks at shows, it doesn't mean that you're a big ol dumb fuck for knowing how wrestling works and discussing the finer points of wrestling with other super fans. Or maybe it does because the wrestlers themselves seem to think you're a piece of shit with no life. All I know for sure is that I still really have no clue who Rip Rogers is other than he had a hand in training Randy Orton, who I typically don't find entertaining at all. 

",1496275586
"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","&gt;this line of thought has the pitfall of rendering causality meaningless

1) So does yours, as I pointed out earlier you can always simply suggest that something might come in and kill you first. Thus, you can in every possible situation argue against causality by your way of looking at it, by just positing that something might happen first, hit by a bus, etc. So your way's not any better, even if you were completely correct

2) You're not correct about what I said anyway. Because it's not true that just any random thing creates an ongoing risk of death forever. Smoking does -- it constantly bombards cells with chemicals that can flip them to cancerous, and every single drag has an ongoing chance that keep applying over and over.

Walking across the street has a chance of death, but once I'm done crossing it becomes 0% again, it does not persist forever. Thus, no matter whether you follow it up with infinite time, it will never be guaranteed to kill you. It will always only have ever had the chance that it did initially, 0.000001% or whatever.

So this only actually applies to a very narrow set of ongoing things, not ""all causality""

&gt; there are some vegans who actually DO endorse these kinds of behaviors, so you're supposition that it would be ridiculous to endorse something like that is crazy is pretty misleading.

Let me rephrase: does the SOCIETY definition endorse that? As you just agreed, it's not ridiculous at all to think that it might, which was actually my point. And so when it just says ""Do everything possible"" it pretty strongly implies that it does, in fact, endorse that. 

Though I'm very much guessing it isn't intended to (because they'd be risking getting arrested, etc. if anybody took them up on it), which would make it a bad definition again if it can very plausibly imply something unintended. But I'm not even actually sure...

&gt; I think this is probably not practicable. Society would grind to a halt if everyone quit working and started picking vegetables. Infrastructure would fall apart, etc.

1) Only 0.5% of people are vegans, so this is not the actual outcome at all if all society members and even all vegans did in fact follow this philosophy.

2) Additionally, why exactly are we assuming the society gives a shit if ""society grinds to a halt"" anyway, at least as we know it (""as we know it"" only, because it would not grind to a halt in general, it would take on a different form)? If society is causing mass animal cruelty, and reformulating it can and would change that, then reformulating society is not only ALLOWED by the definition, but MANDATED by it.",1496275586

The comparison to the Amazon robot is pretty comical. Making a robot perform a task a child can perform is not at all comparable to teaching a program to play go. The point is you don't need to know the parameters of the robot exactly: you just try a few times till you get it right. You can't do that in go. You make one blunder and the game's over.

I'd rather she actually remember my contacts instead of being unable to find people that ARE there.

Siri is AWFUL right now and putting the responsibility of making her not suck on devs that already are stretched thin between iPhone Apps, iPad Apps, iPad Pro Apps, and Android Apps, is a horrible idea. Remember PiP? Remember Split View? Remember the keychain API? Notice how A LOT of the times Apple has released a new custom feature for devs, they don't bother?

"archlinux","t5_2qrzu","Sooo.... I'm a snob when it comes to this stuff (occupational hazard working as a network/systems engineer for an ISP) and I personally run plenty of enterprise gear at home, but pfsense is my router/firewall and i highly recommend anyone with decent technical knowledge get a pfsense box if you can afford it (they start at $300). Pfsense is the only excellent pro-sumer / soho / smb router or firewall on the market right now. DDWRT and such are fine, but IMO pfsense is by far the best due to reliability, performance, features, and monitoring. But when i'm picking out something for family and such, i lean towards Netgear's non-low-end stuff (eg $75+). They've been solid for me for many years. I'd also be comfortable recommending a Linksys or Asus with good reviews that is also a bit higher cost. For a switch, Netgear and Cisco both have soho class ~8 port gig switches around $40. These switches always have better performance, reliability, and higher backplane throughput than consumer switches. For a bit more ($100ish), you can even get managed switching (yay VLANs!).

Additionally, if you can, run a separate AP. This offloads CPU/fpga/SOC power and compute requirements to a different device. The router/switch/ap combos get hot and performance tanks under even moderate sustained load. Never run an ISP provided modem in anything but pass-through. ISPs get those at concession bids and they are always under-powered and low performance. If possible, get an aftermarket modem for best performance and reliability.

For APs, i've yet to find a non-shit consumer AP, but if you can't do SMB gear... it's tolerable enough. And don't get me started on Unifi. They have a major firmware or hardware issue. Latency on certain brands of endpoints (eg iPad, some Samsung Android tabs/phones) is extremely high (exceeding 1000 ms in some cases) and jitter is all over the place. If you search their forums, customers have been reporting the issue for years. Support just tells them to upgrade their firmware and eventually stops responding after blaming the customer for the wireless latency issue (poor signal, etc). I get downvoted every time i rag on Unifi here. There are some real fanboys who haven't done thorough testing.

All of this assumes we're talking about better service than 20 Mbps DSL. You can get away with cheaper gear when the performance requirements are low. I concede that there is a cost/benefit to apply. A 3 Mbps service will run fine on a combo device purchased for $25. Regardless of service, i always recommend at least a decent router/switch/ap combo on a modem in pass-through. This gets you at least a better wifi signal over the ISP combo crap.",1496275589

"running","t5_2qlit","I am also overweight and a newbie runner. Are you watching what you eat as well? I tried running many times to lose weight but I've never been as serious or effective as I am now, using MyFitnessPal to track everything I eat. In terms of weight loss it's 80% food, 20% exercise. 

As for running, the only thing that matters I think for us is consistency. Take good care of your injury first and foremost and then be consistent. We are so out of shape that just going out and running regularly, increasing our speed and distance little by little will give us incredible improvements. I know I went from having to walk 4 times in a 3.75 KM lap around my block to now about a month and a half later being able to run for 40 minutes+ at an ok pace and running a 5KM in 25:45. I'm 210 pounds and 5'9 for reference. 


I also suggest you do some weight training. That's what I have seen lot's of ex-obese now fit people suggest. Weight training let's you keep more muscle (and even gain some if you are as unfit as I was) while also losing weight, which is great because I am done with not liking the way I look, I want a nice body for once in my life. It also helps ton with my posture and my general firmness/squareness/manliness. Like I am still fat but I am more upright, I feel stronger, I feel better.",1496275590

-BBS gives you free 5-6 star characters with the frenzy missions, 1000s of orbs a month, new content weekly/monthly, free summoning tickets on every event, Order rewards daily/weekly/account wide/events, beginer/Advanced missions with 5 star tickets of actual characters (not the free tier ones) and more? we even got two or three free 5 star tickets of which can pull any unit from the game even the highest tier characters. (and that was recently)

and you come in here with ""farm-able units make OPTC more F2P friendly"" bruh....

-I've played OPTC for 529 days which is much longer than I've played BBS atm, I've put more money into OPTC and the game in every which way is still not friendly for F2P players. 

-OP is one of my most favorite anime/mangas and not even my fanboyism will get me to say it's a better game F2P or P2P, bandai is bleh towards the global players lol.

Also, you have critiqued my theoretical personality as to how my failures lead to bad thinking. However you have forgotten to support your allegations that 

&gt;Global Warming is and always has been a political tool to advance Socialism.

which is a preposterous claim. Climate Science is really a thing that serious people, very intelligent people, do. They have been doing it for years, and even have things to show for it. Meteorology, for instance, being a subset. Studying climate models and the workings of the atmosphere has allowed the NOAA to double their forecasts from 5 days to 10 days, and upped the accuracy along the way. This is a real result you yourself have experienced. The facile armchair arguments most deniers come up with, yes, have been thought about by the scientists and addressed. We are talking about a remarkable consensus between tens of thousands of people that something is going on, the only disagreement being the details. But if you would like to respond to this instead of the probable failures of my thinking, allowing you to dismiss me outright without doing so, please go on. I asked why you said what you said, why you believe what you believe, not why my mind is broken. I'm a scientist and assure you I've considered I might just be rooting for the underdog against evidence, but the evidence for climate change is there and real.

if muslims treat islam as a religion thats just a part of personal life (five times prayer, fasting in ramadan, going to pilgrimage to mecca once in a lifetime, giving 2.5% of your wealth as charity) there shouldnt be any problems

shit hits the fan and islam becomes a threat when muslims take koran seriously (and a lot do, hence terrorism) and think sharia is the only law of the land and mohamed was the greatest person ever whose life has to be emulated

But tonally it feels less like old Twin Peaks, more ""Mulholland Drive.""

But if you liked the quirky soap opera aspect of Twin Peaks, that's almost been completely excised. 

I was slightly worried at first it would be too disjointed and art filmic (like not concerned with telling a story, which could be bad, at extreme length, especially,) but episodes 3 and 4 completely reassured me it was just gonna be great.

Eden - or Earth, as the inhabitants called it - was a curious world that was fading to brown and grey. I say it was curious because instead of speaking to me, a foreigner, to establish a form of common understanding, they decided to go deeper. They sliced my skin open and let my innards swarm and fester in their oxygenated air. 

They were my ticket to heaven after a long, windy life. My heaven was a place of learners and knowledge, at a level that was way beyond that of life. They called it *school*, and the oldest person in the *school* blabbered on and on about the importance of *school*, sitting still and paying attention. That was redundant, of course. Why else were they all gathered there?

I got impatient easily at those who spent decades in vain of finding their heaven. Perhaps their steps took them further instead of closer. Will they then be immortal and suffer for eternity? I did not know. 

I peered at the young ones who have gathered in my heaven, but not with my physical eyes so as not to scare them. My stilldead form was not something common among the other species in the galaxy, I've been told. 

My parting wish before I became one with heaven was for them to find their heaven quickly and leave this brown world and a life of suffering. The next time they flipped a book open, perhaps a fragment of my wish would nudge them towards their much-needed clue.

*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs has defended the deal, saying that many other investors, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, own the bonds and that its asset management division bought the securities on the secondary market, without interacting with the Venezuelan government.

&gt; At the root of what makes the bonds so attractive to investors, beyond their more than 20 percent returns, is the crucial role played by the Venezuelan oil company in providing foreign exchange to the embattled Maduro government.

&gt; While Goldman Sachs defended its trade by saying that it bought the bonds on the open market from a broker, bankers and traders say the money ultimately ended up in Venezuela&amp;#039;s treasury because the seller was an institution with ties to the government.

It was a group of like 10 guys and 1 girl who one of the guys was dating. This clearly gave the guy the overinflated sense that he was some sort of irresistible ladies man. When I'd call their orders from the counter he'd always come up and linger to talk to me way longer than I would have liked.

One day his girlfriend called from the table, ""Joey what's the hold up? I'm hungry."" He goes, I shit you not, ""hold on a second sweetie I'm busy flirting with iouandsometimeswhy"" and winked at me.

"oklahoma","t5_2qtnt","&gt; Ah one of your previous replies made me think that this place was amazing lol like I said I am happy it worked for you sight unseen (no plumbing sucks though old school house?).

More like a Spartan Manor that was midway through a conversion to a cottage.

&gt; I'm Native American but when I use to go out in the sun my tan made many people think I was Latino of some sort.

That's the problem I had.  This got super interesting since I was working for the Boy Scouts of America when I got my Oregon ID, so until I moved here, my driver's license photo was when I was 15, sweaty from bicycling halfway across the county after work then standing around in a DMV with no air conditioning, *brown*, slightly sunburned, and in uniform.  Job gave me tanlines from my uniform that didn't fade until only about a year or two before I moved here.  If I wasn't sporting a tan, people were wondering why I stole some Boy Scout's wallet...

They just give you a sticker to wrap around the bottom of your card that contains the updated information and a new barcode when any of the pertinent information changes.  My mom's driver's license photo is from when she was in her 40s still.

&gt; As long as you understand many of these problems are a lot. Oklahoma is fine enough I suppose but I really want out of the Bible belt/Midwest.

I don't disagree.  This place is, if anything, an acquired taste.  At face value, there's *zero* reason why I should enjoy living here, largely for the reasons you describe.  But, the problems tend to be low key, and even in the 7 years I've been here now, I've seen significant movement towards progress.  Except with the schools and tax policy; that's where shit goes off the rails here for like, no reason.

&gt; Texas has it's problem for sure but being a big state with more people makes it better as long as you aren't rural. 

I've got a buddy from Eugene that moved to Honolulu and ended up homeless there, scraped up enough money to get a flight to Lima, Peru and got back on his feet, then threw a dart at a map and ended up in Travis County with his wife.  He loves it there.

&gt; Colorado is almost a culture shock for not being so flat lol

For me, it's the altitude, since usually when I go to Colorado, I'm in Lake City, *the* most remote city in the lower 48, and the only settlement of any size in Hinsdale County, and about the highest altitude city I've spent the night in at 10,000 feet.  I usually end up spending the entire time I'm there whoosy from altitude shock and come back sunburned stop-sign red from the lack of atmosphere.  The entire county doesn't have any traffic lights, buildings with a third floor, and the only chain in town is a Conoco station.  And bears.  Bears outnumber people in the county by a wide margin and there's at least a dozen that call the town itself home.  And that's just fucking awesome to me.",1496275605

The ones I can't stand personally are the ones that brag about American stereotypes of Mexicans as if it was a good thing. ""Look at me, I'm Lupita! I love banda and burritos and Chivas!"" (Insert California slang here)

Unlike some others on here, I don't hate them. They're stubborn and misguided and are facing an identity crisis due to... let's say internal factors. What's sad is that they get views of Mexico from non Mexican POVs, which is *incredibly* disheartning. It comes off as offensive sometimes. But, If they want to live in Mexico and be... Mexican, why stop them?

Then again technically Mexico used to include them in the 1800s... So maybe they are as Mexican as Mexicans.

I really hate how they make Mexican as a race. Fuck, American perceptions of race are pure fucking poison.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","Well, the first thing you need to consider is who made the dungeon? Then, make the STRONGEST NPC version of whoever made it. Then look at the abilities they might have at their disposal. This can give you a good foundation for ""what can be here.""

That being said, puzzles, traps, etc. should all have a REASON to exist, otherwise it's like Elder Scrolls dungeons where no one would actually have lived, moved, or existed there because they'd all die. Give each trap, each puzzle, each riddle a REASON to be there. Once you have a REASON, you can determine how the person who made the obstacle might have made it.

Determining the reason can also help you determine what kind of obstacle. Each obstacle can be used as much to keep people out as in, but for which purpose it's designed can help control what the trap does.

I hope this helps!

**Edit:** The core of what I'm trying to say above is that there shouldn't be puzzles and riddles just for the sake of puzzles and riddles. They should mean something, there should be a reason they exist.

Also, side note, anything that has no guaranteed way of getting past it should be OPTIONAL. The main path through the dungeon should require no more than Doom keycard technology to get through.",1496275606

Both bands are utilizing the same DHCP server, and there isn't segregation between the bands. Even with the SSID not being broadcasted your 5GHz band can still access the 2.4GHz band which the iOT devices are located on. This isn't secure.

The router is the first step towards VLANs. If you paired an EdgeRouter-X with a UAP-AC-LITE (or similar) you'd be all set. You could setup a separate SSID on a VLAN, with Firewall rules to prevent  any sort of cross-talk, as well as preventing uPnP.

Most routers have a section where they'll list uPnP ports, I'm not sure what router you currently have, but I'm not sure if it has the option and if it does I'm not sure if I could walk you through. It can likely be found under DHCP or a uPnP section.",1496275607

Higher caliber pistols (.40 and up) are effective against snorks, and sometimes the extra range over a shotgun can help if they jump out of reliable buckshot range and your rifle is dry.

I ended up dropping out of high school, getting a GED and going to college. I dropped out of college to work an IT job I was offered in sophmore year.. something really basic; Desktop support at a plumbing company. Helping end users and putting paper in the printers and what not. I ended up moving up a little in that company into an operations role and then it went under. After that, I found a job at a local IT service provider and really got my chops 'trial by fire' style there. 


4 years later, due to a fortunate set of circumstances, I own a company that is a direct asset purchase of that IT service provider. I have a handful of great employees who I take the best possible care of, and a wonderful family of 6 that I couldn't live without.

College is great, but you can be successful without it. I'm certainly not advocating that you do what I did, but I will say that you should always blaze your own path and not mindlessly do whatever is the norm or you'll never truly control your own destiny.",1496275615

"cpp_questions","t5_2tdbd","You can always fall back to C++03-like solutions, e.g. having the initialization data in a raw array.

The problem with C++11 (and later) solutions, like [docs I wrote about it over at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/c%2b%2b/3017/arrays/10246/a-dynamic-size-matrix-using-stdvector-for-storage#t=201705312343160003533), is that apparently your compiler is not comfortable with all C++11 and later features, and you don't seem to be familiar with the tool, e.g. how to add the proper options to get C++11.

I think you will find it well worth the trouble to dive into the tool usage details, how to make your compiler assume C++11 or later, if possible. As mentioned I believe it's option `--cpp11` with your compiler, based on an informed google-assisted guess about which compiler that is. But until then, here's some example very verbose and not elegant C++03 code:

    // C++03 stuff -- rather clumsy.

    #include &lt;stddef.h&gt;     // size_t
    #include &lt;vector&gt;

    namespace my{
        using std::vector;

        typedef int M2_data[2][2];
        
        M2_data const&amp;
            data_m2()
        {
            static int const the_data[2][2] = { {1, 5}, {3, 10} };
            return the_data;
        }

        template&lt; size_t n &gt;
        vector&lt; vector&lt;int&gt; &gt;
            matrix_from( int const (&amp;data)[n][n] )
        {
            vector&lt; vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; result;
            for( int y = 0; y &lt; n; ++y )
            {
                result.push_back( vector&lt;int&gt;( &amp;data[y][0], &amp;data[y][n] ) );
            }
            return result;
        }
    }  // namespace my


    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;      // std::setw

    int
        main()
    {
        using namespace std;
        vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; const matrix = my::matrix_from( my::data_m2() );
        int const n = matrix.size();

        for( int y = 0; y &lt; n; ++y )
        {
            for( int x = 0; x &lt; n; ++ x )
            {
                cout &lt;&lt; setw( 4 ) &lt;&lt; matrix[y][x];
            }
            cout &lt;&lt; ""\n"";
        }
    }

I believe that adapting this to use of  a `vector`-based matrix *class* instead of just a vector of vector, can be a nice exercise.

"gangplankmains","t5_38he7","You shouldnt be pushing the wave into his turret. If he frequently takes bad trades and flees to his turret, you have to bait him out of his turret range. Freeze the wave on your side of the lane. He has to walk up to farm, and doing this while low is super risky. You need to not mindlessly auto the wave, and choose your autos with meaning. If you know he is backed, hard push the wave, if you know he is low but not backed, freeze the wave, and start a slow push. With the slow push you can threaten a dive. If he fights you the minions will aggro him. Monitor his barrels, people forget that his barrels run out eventually, if he misses a barrel combo, or uses it to farm while you can get to him, make sure he knows that youre not going to let him do that. Tryndamere and Kayle are hard matchups for GP because of their dives, but darius and swain arent any easier. Darius, take ghost, wait for him to use a barrel combo on the wave, as long as it misses you, ghost at him and land your e. He cant fight you with no barrels, even with barrels, its unlikely he wins that fight. That will either get him killed or push him completely out of lane, and youre free to freeze the wave on your side, preventing him farming. Swain is just about diving when he has a minion wave under his turret. You should easily outdamage him, and his is more than likely going to use his heal escaping your snare. The biggest reason a Gangplank can lose lane is that he cant farm, so you need to prevent that by completely zoning him off the wave. You dont need to kill GP over and over.

Wrong comments made in good faith (e.g. Someone that argues that Kozilek is the best ramp target in Standard because they actually believe it to be true and they make an effort to argue for that) are fine.

Upside, you perform physical labor.  You nurture the sick.  You are paid handsomely. You wear a uniform. The benefits aren't as good as they used to be but still beat most jobs (insurance)

Hard not to cry when a family member hugs you.

Many Frontline jobs only require certificates, Associate, and licensure.  Continuing education is mandated by licensure.

I am finishing college online to possibly switch to a cubicle job. I'm done with the field work. My body is tired. Lifting, pulling, pushing...I'm done.

Furthermore, I would like to point out that sword fighting isn't like it's seen in modern movies and tv shows (why the tower of joy scene was utter trash), and all the swift moves. It actually looks quite dull and the attackers are using the sword in a manner to attack head on with the intent to kill.

I have had a fair share of bullying, and a father who kept telling me my whole life how useless and pathetic I was, so believe you me when I say I know how it's like to face hatred on a daily basis. The ONLY reason I am sane is because I ignored that what I cannot change and moved on. But enough of that cheesy sounding story, nobody cares about my life story.

You can address the issue right here, right now. And the fact that you chose not to do it, and instead throw a tantrum was beyond me.

In my experience, Muslims who adhere to strict dietary rules expect that they can't guarantee anything from a business that is not certified as halal, the same goes for Jewish people who keep kosher. We don't expect everyone to drop everything and change their operating procedures for us. So if someone were to come in and order a muffin warmed up, they're taking the acceptable risk that it might be cross-contaminated. Someone who is exceptionally strict will probably stick to halal-certified businesses or prepare their own foods. 

If you want to bring it up to your manager I'd definitely frame it as ""a customer had a question about tongs and cross contamination"" and go from there. You don't have to name this mystery customer, but it does keep the focus on customers and not you.

I would love to get another cat, but she violently does not like other cats and the shelter strongly advised she be the only cat.

"daddit","t5_2rxue","My wife and I just had our first a month and a half ago. Everything was going fine until about halfway through the pregnancy, where an ultrasound detected an enlarged fluid build up on one side of the brain. Suddenly, we where transferred to a high risk ward at a much larger hospital 1.5 hour drive away from home. It got worse. The initial diagnosis was the valve was not working right to let the fluid drain, which could have been solved with a shunt at birth. Turns out, what they believe happened was she suffered a stroke while in the womb. The issue was not that there was to much fluid, but the brain matter around it didn't develop as much to push it back. We where given a fairly optimistic diagnosis though, with the worst case scenario probably being a mild form of cerebral palsy. There was a lot of concerns they watched out for at birth, as all of this increased the chance for a lot of other complications. All said and done, she came out very healthy at this stage. We still need to watch for developmental markers around the 6 month range, but we'll get there when we get there.

I was terrified. I didn't know how I'd handle a special needs child, especially for my first. Looking at her now though, I don't think I could handle not knowing her.

So, within the context of being Johnny. Put yourself in his shoes within his world of Georgia and look from his perspective. At some point he picks up a fiddle and at some point he gains some sort of *insane* confidence that he is not only good enough to beat the Devil, but the best there's ever been. 

We could say it was blind Pride. But I've been Proud with a capital P about things and get shown up. That's the real downfall is that there's always a bigger fish, always someone better, so don't go getting Prideful or God will show you what's up by sending someone better. However Johnny could have intrinsically known that the Devil wasn't that bigger fish. I mean, some martial artists can tell others apart by how they walk and carry themselves, right? Maybe preternaturally good violinists have something similar.

But I'd also argue you don't have to empirically beat everyone before you can know you're the best. Like, if Johnny was doing things with the violin that literally no one else could tell him how he was even doing it. That be a great way to know.
Inventing things for his own pleasure to listen to that was, musically amazing, and how many teachers does he ask about his penta-halfstep-chord duo melody before he realizes ""oh, I'm the best there's ever been"" I'm stretching but the song doesn't necessarily disprove that. 

As far as the bet goes, I do believe there's a large difference between a bet and a deal. I can bet you that if a coin lands heads up I win and tails you lose. It doesn't give you any chance. A bet doesn't necessarily mean that the outcome is in question. 
Taking the bet does kind of seem arrogant without the benefit of knowing he wins I'll admit. But I don't think that's enough to be a sin.

The other thing is that despite whatever poverty an Asian immigrant was escaping, they had the mental fortitude and resources to immigrate. So immigrants are a bit of a special pool of people, and it's a little unfair to compare them to a more normal group of people. ",1496275635

*****
&gt; BISMARCK, N.D. - The developer of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, which is expected to begin shipping oil on Thursday, will face scrutiny later this summer on whether it violated North Dakota rules during construction.

&gt; The three-member North Dakota Public Service Commission is looking into whether Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners removed too many trees and shrubs along the pipeline route, and whether it improperly reported the discovery of Native American artifacts.

&gt; The $3.8 billion pipeline will move North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois.

But that doesn't necessarily work for every energy demand. And if cars become more and more electric the demand will skyrocket. Right now solar and wind are backed by natrual gas.  That means for every kw produced by solar or wind, a kw could be produced by natural gas to replace it if it goes down or if price makes it a good idea. As long as solar and wind stay variable power dources this will not go away. And we cant have only solar and wind eith a few natural gas plants as back up because then the natural gas infrastructure will collase from lack of demand and it will be too expensive.

Your phone can only transmit a tiny fraction of the power that a cell tower transmits with. This seems nonreciporcal until you factor that the tower has very large antennas, and almost always twin antennas pointed in each direction. The twin antennas have high gain compared to the no-gain or even negative-gain antenna in your device. Also the cellular base radio has extremely effective receive filters which all add up to being EXTREMELY sensitive. Therefore, your device can effectively upload your hd video to YouTube with such relatively low power. 
Also, consider that cell devices don't transmit 100% at any time. The devices transmit in time slices so that they can all share a frequency for this purpose. The low percentage of ""duty"" means that while your device can transmit at it's top power level when needed(as commanded dynamically by the tower), it's only sending for very short bursts.

I've defended Pete a bunch already and this isn't really a defense of him specifically, but I have to imagine if they were contemplating extending him that they considered the possibility that the wheels could fall off at some point this season.  Like you mentioned, they're the ones who put this roster together without adding veterans other than Saunders, Kendrick, and Buchholz, so I think they knew a 100-loss season was possible. Even without the extension, I'm not a big fan of firing a manager to send a message unless he's lost the clubhouse or is consistently doing dumb shit, and I'm not prepared to say either is happening. Still, I'm struggling to figure out their vision for him.

Finally, Kruk is just awesome. I know he's well compensated and all, but I feel bad for him and the rest of the broadcast crew. I hope Kruk sticks around for when this all hopefully pays off.",1496275640

Because, as his [single, no less] mother, you feel you should be fostering the environment that best utilizes his potential, yet you're feeling like you're failing in that arena. But you're not.

You see him growing into a brilliant, charismatic man, full of massive aspiration. And you're telling yourself it's no thanks to you. It's not. You're raising a brilliant, charismatic man, who's determined to DO something, something huge, with his life. And it's all thanks to you. Your son feels loved, and safe, and confident in himself. How do you think that happened? 

You're obviously an incredible, devoted, adoring mother. YOU make your son feel loved. YOU make your son feel safe. YOU make your son feel confident and capable. YOU make your son proud.

I wouldn't be surprised if you learn, someday in the future, when your son is an astronaut, that he did it for you. He did it so he could return the favor you've given him, and help you finally have the best, the life he believed you always deserved. You're giving him everything you can, and no doubt, busting your ass to do so. He knows this, and he loves you for it.

Your intellect versus his, in my opinion, honestly has nothing to do with how you're feeling. You're just not giving yourself the credit you're due, and it's manifesting as intellectual insecurity. Stand tall, and keep doing what you're doing. You're clearly doing it well. ❤️",1496275640

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Humans have an understanding of right from wrong since eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

Right, and were talking about Adam's period prior to knowledge of evil.

&gt;A good parent shouldn't shelter their children from the world, or their own choices for that matter.

Baby proofing and not letting bad influences near are common and reasonable things.

&gt;I'm not sure why the statement that God had no need to let Adam learn from his mistakes is relevant.

Your claim is that it is good for parents to let their kids make bad choices. I assumed the reason was so that they could learn from their mistakes, and applied that to Adam. Can you clarify why you believe what you said?

&gt;Satan wasn't really a formal concept at the time of writing Genesis and I would say the snake represents the ego of man to choose what is outside of God's will and to rationalize it as good.

Then I guess that makes three qualities that God gave Adam which would enable his failure: independence, ability to sin, and ego. 

&gt;What I'm saying is that we have free will and choose to act in a non holy manner. Let me know if that is confusing you.

Yes it is. Because how and why would God make us in such a way that, like him, we have free will, but then make us different enough that we might choose sin. 

&gt; clarify your last point

&gt;&gt;If God created us like a parent completely restraining us to force us to only do his will, we wouldn't be created in the image of God as we wouldn't be free.

&gt;God is free, God is perfection. By making us different from him, he made us imperfect and worse than himself. It makes no sense to argue that we needed to be different from him in order to have certain qualities.

What I am saying is, God shouldn't need to force us to do anything. He should have just made us with more of the qualities as himself, including the will only to do good. That would no more be forcing us to do good than God is forced to do good.",1496275640

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","It's gaining very quickly in Europe among the most valuable sports demographic of young men with disposable income to spend on tickets, merchandise and betting (we find it really weird that US sports have a moral aversion to betting, which is a massive source of revenue in European sports through sponsorship deals, including the principal shirt sponsorships for 8 out of 20 premier league clubs-presumably the NFL's ruthless capitalists will find a way of casting off those scruples as part of the Raiders' move to Vegas).

 People who wrote off American football as advert-riddled slow rugby with pads in the past are being given occasional exposure, and realising that there's a lot more to the game than we were all led to believe, and really getting into the game.

A surprising number of my friends play fantasy, and it's fairly accessible on sky or through streams.

People often point out that the London games sell 85k seats four times a year without fail, and that there's enough demand to sell 8 games if it came to that. What people don't often point out is that the average price per seat for NFL games in London is around £75-80, with a maximum of £150. Premier league tickets average around £40 across the league, with the most expensive being arsenal tickets at around £100 for premium seats at a premium match. That shows that the demand for NFL product in Europe (a sizable fraction of the crowd at each game come from Germany/Scandinavia) is strong enough to sell large volumes of tickets at prices that the richest football clubs would kill to charge. 

I'm not saying demand is strong enough to sustain a franchise (most fans here would prefer the current arrangement, but with more games each year), but it's definitely growing, quickly.",1496275643

And the people the RNC is giving this stage to tend to be the craziest of the craziest like Gingrich, Bachmann, Santorum, *Trump*, etc. The committees are really the ones at fault for saying ""hey guys these are your choices for the nomination, deal with it"". They don't really pick the candidate (well, they do, but it's judged on the will of the voters), but they pick the contenders.

I'm just saying that I think the general election would be a little more *normal* if the committee's really stayed out until at least the candidate has been decided. Could also contribute to undoing the two-party power struggle that we have, along with eliminating the electoral college.

"Multicopter","t5_2u9hy","The best choice would be more than what your system is capable of drawing. I think you're thinking about current wrong. You have 25A ESCs, 25A is just what your ESCs are capable of *delivering* to the motors, but that isn't all the time. Voltage level indicates the potential of your pack to deliver power, current/amperage is like the rate of power delivered. So at low throttle, your motors are spinning slow, so they don't need a high rate of power (meaning low current draw), whereas at high throttle they need a lot of power, so high current draw.

Since your ESCs can deliver 100A combined, you should get a pack that can deliver at least that. 100A / 1.3A = 76.9. So 45C won't be high enough. If you want Tattu packs (I used to fly them before I switched to Turnigy Graphenes), their 75C packs are a good choice. I've heard great things about Tattu R-line graphene packs, I'd say they're definitely worth a look.",1496275644

- [Hector](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/0/00/Fe7Hector.png/revision/latest?cb=20151014150233), Well he is grabbing something like a sword, it looks sharp like a sword and he has blue hair like Marth who uses a sword, so must be a sword wielder.
- [Ephraim](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/a/a9/Fess-ephraim.png/revision/latest?cb=20160930100119), Well the thing he is carrying is pointy like a sword though he clearly is not good at grabbing the sword handle. He looks too angry, is he a Xander/Leo clone? Too redundant to include since they use swords.
- [Micaiah](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/9/9c/Micaiah_%28FE10_Artwork%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20160930101019), Well birds like swords and it looks like she might be carrying a invisible sword. She has silver hair so she's an Effie clone, plus that flat chest also says that she is a Lucina clone... too redundant to include since Lucina already has a sword.
- [Tibarn](https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/e/e6/Ferd-tibarn.png/revision/latest?cb=20170428012219), Well he is too ugly because he has scars, fujoshis like pretty boys. Are those bandages? What a weakling (unlike Ryoma). Also are those big brown things swords? They sure look like swords, they are like 30, that's too many swords!

However, there are still some students in the rad therapy because they plan on going to post graduate or med school. Since job market is low for rad therapy, there are less students entering the stream therefore class sizes are like 15 instead of 30. They are better off cutting the stream to save costs.

so your second year summer, you will go to your first clinical site. this allotment process was described by msGlam. ""relocate"" is basically any hospital that is 1.5 hours drive away from mcmaster university. If you placed in a ""relocate"" site on your first clinical (2nd year summer;3 months), then on your 2nd clinical placement (4th year;6 months), you will get placed in your first choice.
            
 * there are people that are willing to relocate for their first clinical placement (2nd year summer) just so that they can get their first choice for clinical placement in 4th year. If you know where you want to go for your 2nd clinical placement and there are more people than spots available at that place, then you can relocate on first clinical just so that you can be automatically placed in your top clinical placement choice.
 * in your first placements(for example radiography), most students want hamilton sites because since they are renting, they are better off renting the same house for the whole 12 months (from start of 2nd year to end of 1st clinical placement)
 * the clinical liason will say that people that do not get their favourable choice still end up loving the hospital they went to.(this is utterly BULLSHIT that the clincal liason says to keep you in the program)
    * there are students that hated to commute up to 1 hour because most of their day is gone(imagine doing this for the whole week)
 * I got placed in my 2nd choice for my first placement. Havent chosen our next placement choices yet
 * for sonography, unlike radiography and rad therapy, there is 3 clinical sites you have to go to. 1st site done in 2nd year summer, 2nd site done in 4th year (sept to dec) and 3rd site done in 4th year (jan to march). Whereas radiography and rad therapy, 1st site is 2nd year summer, 2nd site done 4th year (sept to march)
 * if anyone is considering radiography, believe me I've been in this shit. during my first clinical placement, the technologist were saying that ""you should've went into ultrasound"" because of higher pay and higher job demand. For anyone considering radiography, note this....You will not find a full time job, only part time. BUT, the reason why most people choose radiography is because it is vast. What I mean is that if you dont like general radiography (simple xrays), you can also do MRI, CT, angio, OR, and Cath lab.
 * what kept me in this program was the prof saying how everyone was going to find a job after they graduate LOL - and assumed it was a full time position (most people assumed this as well) 
 * also note this, if you dont like being treated as a fuckign dog, dont join this program. the clinical placement makes you feel like utter shit because the techs talk shit to you (most of the time it is the females that treat you like shit, the males are cool as fuck.) Usually, the techs talk behind your back but you know it. and rarely, they fucking bark infront of your face.
 * MY LAST NOTE, anyone considering this program, if you do not get into ultrasound/sonography, jump the ship and leave this program. Totally not worth it",1496275645

You'll really be thankful you did. 

As for feed, depends on what jurisdiction you're in. If you are in a jurisdiction where it's legal, I'd say indulge with moderation. Just do it at parties or with friends. But if you're just smoking weed to watch TV alone, you may be engaging in unhealthy behavior. This is the time in your life when a little hard work will have the greatest reward. if you just spend it high watching TV you're setting yourself back. 

If you're in a jurisdiction where it's illegal to smoke weed, I'd stop. The possibility of getting caught has dire consequences, and especially as you approach your later 20's the excuse of youthful indiscretions begins to wear thin.

Any country where there's a significant population that is religious is going to have a higher marriage rate before having children.  Also in the US there's all kinds of fringe benefits that the government provides you (although I don't nessecarily agree with them).

Actually in the US one of the funniest things I've seen is a bunch of people equating marriage with love that didn't before largely because of the media regarding the gay rights movement saying love is love, therefore you need to be able to get married to show your love.  I imagine this will die down in a bit, but it's definitely effected some of my friends subliminally. 

I know a bunch of people who don't get married and are super happy.  I also know a bunch of people who wouldn't be happy to not be married.  This entire post is all about him him him with distain towards her view on marriage but speaks nothing about her religious views, beliefs on relationships, etc.  Because of that I find it highly probable that she places a high value on marriage and he's ignoring it for what reason?

Quite a lot of work has been done since then, from large things like new modules and new syntax, to heaps of modest improvements and conveniences.  I can't possibly see how anyone could justify not using the last seven-plus years of Python development when writing new code.

f-strings are amazing.  The changes in unpacking (PEP-3132 and PEP-448) are slick as all hell.  `os.scandir()` is heavenly.  `functools.lru_cache` is super handy.  `collections.ChainMap` solves a very common problem.  Those are just a sampling of things off the top of my head.  Why are you denying yourself all this stuff?

(\*) The feature freeze for the 2.7 branch, the point at which no new features can be added, was 2010-04-03, when 2.7.0 beta 1 was released.

&gt; Miles Mathis (born 1964) is an American artist, poet, writer, **pseudoscientist and conspiracy theorist.**

&gt; **Mathis is best known for his outlandish and often ridiculous theories.** For instance, that π (pi) is actually equal to 4 (""in all kinematic situations""); not even the Bible is with him on this far-fetched claim. He has also invented a charge field theory which, like all of his other myriad theories, **has yet to pass the scrutiny of a basic peer review.**

&gt; Mathis is proud to have written over 400 pseudoscientific ""articles"" and assures us that the current derivatives of many elemental functions are wrong and all mathematicians (and physical experiments using these functions) are utterly mistaken. His evidence for these claims are usually references to his own articles. He claims to be able to decipher the givens of the mathematical greats, similar to Isaac Newton being able to decipher the Bible with mathematical proofs.

2) Anonymous sources claim Trump [was considering](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/donald-trump-tv-network) his own ""mini-media conglomerate"" to cash in on the groundswell he tapped into, if and when he lost the campaign.

Add to that the reports of how miserable Trump and the people around him are, and I think he never really expected to win, but thought it would potentially be good for business.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Somebody said this in your MTG thread but as an owner my advice is to not sit on stock. I go into other stores and see dust collecting on old editions of games because they ordered too many all those years ago when it came out and never sold it and then it was replaced with a second edition or something newer and better. 

I personally order one or two copies of games and if they sell quickly I reorder them. Don't be afraid to discount something months later if it's just been sitting if that means you'll finally sell it. 

I've also donated games as prizes to our events and to local events in the community. That helps get rid of some old stock as well and the event attendees and organizers will love you for it. 

Don't be afraid to have competitive pricing. If someone can drive to another place across town because the game they want is cheaper there, they will. 

It sounds like I'm just telling you to discount everything and never make money but I intend the opposite. Be smart about your purchases and inventory. Create a strong and good relationship with your distribution reps, they're good people and want to see you succeed. Same with your regular customers. 

Don't be afraid to make weekly small orders instead of monthly large orders. Keep your stock fresh and customers will make your shop a destination. 

Even as an internet stranger I want to see you succeed in this industry with the rest of us. I learned a lot from watching and paying attention to what other stores in my area did right and what they did wrong. 

Oh and try to have some fun while you're at it. 

Good luck. ",1496275654

C is wrong because Passage A states the audience was moved by humility and hope.  That's opposite of ""suggests audiences can't relate...on their own.""  They related on their own.

D is confused.  Passage B states that there's an emotional lopsidedness to the cast, and then B spends an entire paragraph criticizing the new cast's inability to deliver.  But D states that the original cast couldn't deliver a rich treatment.

The first time you use an Android phone after you buy it, it will ask you a bunch of setup questions. Perhaps you said no when it asked you about synchronisation for contacts. If so, it can be enabled later in App Drawer &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Google. Make sure Contacts is turned on [like this](http://i.imgur.com/AnKd5sc.png).

Another possibility is that you were adding your contacts in some app other than Google's Contacts app. If so, it won't synchronise with Google Contacts, but perhaps with some other service.

It's also possible that you're using a different Google account on your phone to the one on the device that you're using to try to view your contacts now. To make sure you're logged into the correct Google account, go to the [Play Store settings](https://play.google.com/settings/) on your computer. It will have a list of your devices, which looks [like this](http://i.imgur.com/IyWPYEL.png).

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","I don't believe they'll ever find something like that 'kills pain' like opioids but isn't addictive. Pain is just a signal from your body to your brain that something is wrong and that signal causes stress and anxiety. It is removing that stress and anxiety that makes opioids so effective. Even when I use a shit load of fentanyl I can still feel physical pain. The difference is that it doesn't bother me as much. Most painkillers that actually dull real physical pain (usually for surgery and such) don't leave the user functional. Which defeats the purpose.

What we actually can expect from such research? People with actual pain getting less effective pain killers to fuel the 'war on drugs' machine.",1496275657

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","You're only looking at your gain and not the other persons loss.

Not all business owners are rich. While you may have more spending power another person paying it and has less, especially since they have no guarantee of income like you.

If the business makes no money the owner gets nothing yet you get, legally, x amount. 

So, while you gain others lose. You've also risked nothing. 

So you've ignored the owners risk, you've ignored their reward, you've ignored the fact owners have no guaranteed wage. 

What separates you as an employee versus an employer? Nothing outside someone else's ability to take a risk. However, you took none and want the reward. 

So while you may have more spending power, the employer may have less, it may cost someone their job, and that person now has less.

As well, some jobs aren't worth that and will be merged to others so they end up doing more work for same pay while a 9 dollar an hour job disappears. So what yore saying is a 2 way street, while it may help you it'll be at the expense of someone else.",1496275657

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","You are taking the discussion above out of context. The line of discussion was in reply to people saying that fast charging ""doesn't really matter for most consumers"" and then u/odd84 saying that most Americans don't go on road trips and wouldn't take their EV if they did.

My replies had nothing to do with issues of access or living in a bubble where only my routes matter. As I said, ""why would anyone rent a car and pay for gas given the option not to""? The option not to is key to that sentence. I'm sure there are currently plenty of places I want to go where I would still take our SUV because fast charging hasn't arrived yet. For example, we drove to Nova Scotia for vacation last year... they have no Superchargers up there yet. That said, as soon as a few are installed, the calculation will change. Along with better infrastructure, faster charging rates and longer range will solve most, if not all, of the current issues people have.

All it takes is one location to install a fast charger in Chilicothe or Macon and the point is moot. Have you asked convenience stores about them? Do they know there's demand? As it is, every Tesla model and the Bolt could cover the entire drive from St. Joe to Hannibal on a single 100% charge. Plugshare shows 2 fast chargers in St. Joe, though none on the other end.

And where are you getting the numbers for your Washington, DC to Quincy, IL trip?
EV Trip Planner says: 
DC to STL is 842 miles, 16:06 hours, 2:49 charging time.
DC to Quincy is 924 miles, 17:56 hours, 3:27 charging time.

And with her kids it's not even an option. And there is NO way TA doesn't have coverage for his family through his job.  She'll IG and gloat about her precious bike, her pot, her wine, her yoga, her hideous hair and outfits. Not to mention her vacations and me time.

In that sense, she was actually portrayed to be more flustered and such. If you have the time, I would suggest reading the Novels when you can. Bear in mind the english translations for the novels overall has stagnated ever since 2016, Novel 9 is still not done as of yet.
Regarding your wish to season 3, I realistically can't see them making it as there is not enough source material as of yet, would say after 2-3 more it would be a possibility.

5) A physical health buffer for forts and keeps that exceeds any form of shielding previously in the game, as well as providing poke on objectives at a longer range than any other hero.

Now what I have to say comes from me having been at a brewery for a few months now. 

Pay attention and listen closely to what they say. It depends on what tasks they will have be doing as to how much you will need to know about caustic and different chemicals. You will be fine with standard rubber boots but be carful to not drop a full keg on your foot (that shit hurts and can be uncomfortable even with a steal toe). Jeans and a Tshirt will be cool for your first day, but I recommend getting something a little heavier duty if you get the job(I have some Carhart pants and some Duluth Flex that I manly wear). I have found that there are two camp when it comes to Brewers, one that tucks the pant into the boot and one that wears it over the boot. I side on the side with wearing it over just because I have heard the stories of getting hot wort in the boot. That being said I have a friend who wears shorts and steal toe construction boots cause well being is a hot process and he hates sweeting. Other things to consider: wear long socks cause boots will rub the back of you calves raw and have a bandana one you to get the sweat out of you face. 

Like others said don't try to streamline their process. Take notes and write your questions down. It tends to go better to ask questions at the end of the day over a beer than in the midst of hell. That being said if you don't understand something then you need to ask for more direction so you don't fuck something up. 

Best of luck.",1496275661

Without him do you feel empty/miss him to an extreme extent when he is not with you, do you think about him often?
Perhaps he is not your FP but since you dated for so long it is not irrational at all that you still have strong feelings relating to him. I am so sorry about your situation, though, and I hope one day you do find the right person for you, I believe that you can do it. ",1496275666

This is the downside of CS interviewing. You bring up some good points, but then have some of the standard CS questions that make me puke a little.

"PvZHeroes","t5_3d3mh","First things first: If you plan on playing a lot of kabloom, Blooming Heart is an excellent next craft, and I would place it much more highly than dandy lion king.

Second, if you want to run it in solar flare, you should play a little more to using solar as a support class. Right now all your cards are kabloom and you're not taking advantage of the potential cards you could use by picking solar flare.

Into actual cards: Squash is too slow. This deck should be ending games on 7 with Grapes or before then with shrooms and pineclone. On that same note, cherry is also too slow and (while you're already removing it) poison oak is as well because it doesn't guarantee any damage. 

As for adding cards: Blooming Hearts, once you get them, are amazing turn 1 cards that don't even fall off too hard near the end of the game (which should be around turn 5-7 with this deck). 2 copies of berry angry would be perfect for helping push lethal without being dead too often. Sun shroom (this week's event card) is practically made for this deck. It has Team up for stacking pineclones, it has mushroom synergy, and it helps ramp into pineclone and grapes. I'd definitely add around 2-3 copies once you get them. Jack-o-lantern is also a good aggro card because, like blooming heart, it ramps up damage requiring an answer from your opponent (blooming heart is better because it comes online earlier though, so I'd craft those first)

TL;DR - -2 poison oak, -2 cherry bomb, -2 squash. +2 berry angry, +3 sun shroom, +1 poison ivy.

Later, -4 poison shroom, -3 poison ivy, +4 Blooming Heart, +3 Jack-o-lantern",1496275667

Essence Reaver is typically not picked up, because usually you want it as a first item. Blade is just a far superior first item spike on Lucian, it has literally everything that he wants in an item and it has very good synergy with his passive.

The Q mana nerfs I also don't think will seriously effect most good Lucian players, you just have to use your Q more sparingly and not use it every time it is off of cd on a minion wave. It also becomes more important to not miss the ability in lane, but this still isn't a problem for good Lucian players.

"AMA","t5_2r4eo","It sounds like you are not familiar with the Holocaust Denier playbook at all. For example:

&gt;Are you joking? Because the first thing he said was ""deny it, no"".

This is the first line Holocaust Deniers use. They act as if all they are doing is questioning the numbers. There are numerous red flags  in OP's comments that are common in the Holocaust deniers playbook.

&gt; there is some evidence that disputes the official 6 million claim

This is straight up denial. Expressing the opinion that the historical consensus is incorrect is Holocaust Denial. Pure and simple. The OP also slips up here because he/she refers only to the number of Jewish victims (6 million) as opposed to the total victims (somewhere around 11 million). This implies that OP expressly believes in a conspiracy to inflate the number of Jewish victims specifically. Again, a common red flag for Holocaust deniers.

&gt; but my goodness, someone dares question the Holocaust in any capacity, we are immediately Hitler incarnate?

This is another tool in the Holocaust Denier book of tricks. They claim to be persecuted for merely questioning the historical consensus. But anyone familiar with their rhetoric knows that they are doing far more than asking questions.

&gt;We are brow beaten from the time we hit our indoctrination camps til the grave about soaps and lampshades.

Holocaust Deniers will often bring up these two myths as evidence that the historical record is flawed. This is a big red flag, because both the soap and lampshade stories were debunked by historians decades ago. They are deliberating misrepresenting the historical consensus to make it seem flawed.

&gt;Besides, your logic is flawed. Denial of the holocaust does not imply anti-semetism.

It sometimes just means pure stupidity, but it is a Neo-Nazi conspiracy theory, invented by nazi's and propagated by them, so the anti-semitism is usually part of equation.

"NonBinary","t5_2vcez","The two languages that I am learning both are pretty good when it comes to non-gendered pronouns. 

I absolutely love American Sign Langauge, because you just sort of point off to the side for the 3rd person singular (he/she/singular they equivalent in English), and maybe add a bit of a wave for 3rd person plural (plural they equivalent in English).

You can just sign ""Person"" if you want to avoid man/woman. Also, I just learned the signs for things like ""Gender non-conforming"" and ""queer"" at an ASL retreat a few weeks ago. They're pretty up on their terminology. I would say the ASL-knowing community (Deaf community included) where I live in Chicago is pretty progressive. 

The other language I'm learning, Tagalog, just has one gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun, siya (he/she equivalent in English). Neutral third-person plural is sila. 

Grammatically, like the English she/her/hers, you get siya/niya/kanya. Though it's more of a linguistic accident than any progressive nature inherent to their culture (The Philippines is pretty Catholic). The Philippines pre-colonization had (and still have, to some degree) a third gender called ""bakla,"" but that has come to be slang for gay men. ",1496275670

I feel too many people discount it because it has a bad stigma of being ""unfun"" when playing support is the best it's ever been. Just trying to open some eyes to the role. Also I would disagree with you on champions.

Edit: You can take virtually any champion to extremely high elo, it's simply how well you play them. It's not the champions, but the players that carry.",1496275673

All transit agencies that have high farebox recovery ratios are rail operators, and therefore have similar (in your view unaccounted for) capital expenditures and grant/bond infusions. Among bus operators, there isn't some suburban bus line somewhere that you can finagle your way to the top of the list. Buses don't generate nearly as much revenue as rail.",1496275673
"videos","t5_2qh1e","Sounds like you are making excuses.

Being outdoors, or more specifically, being outdoors in natural environments does actually reduce depression. It's been studied and it's not just a myth. It's a very healthy activity. Vitamin D is hugely important to our well being and is best absorbed through sunlight. I guess you could choose to supplement but it's less efficient and proves that being indoors is not natural.

Screen time too, does have measurable effects. The light of a screen interrupts your melatonin production, thus keeping you awake for longer and interrupting your natural sleep patterns. Multiple studies have also shown shrinkage of grey matter in the brain correlates with extended screen time and thus reduced cognitive function.

We never evolved for either. You just need to accept that what you enjoy probably isn't particularly good for you. And until you've actually tried to change your lifestyle you can't claim that you wouldn't feel any happier or healthier if you did get more outdoor time and less screen time.",1496275673

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Longer post incoming. Based on my experiences in going from flat broke to Efund and still having spending money.

First month of budgeting isn't about deciding how much you're going to spend. it's about figuring out how much you are already spending so that you can tune and adjust it going forward.

Basic all-inclusive categories are: Housing, Grocery, Transportation, Communication (Phone, Internet, etc), Retirement, *and the most important* **Recreation**. 

Rec budget is critical. It includes stuff like eating out, coffees with friends, beers, going to the movies, or whatever day to day spending. I see friends attempt to spend as little as possible but end up tapping their card for this and that - it adds up to more than they expect. Having your number means that you have to make sacrifices once in a while. It means that you have to prioritize going to the movies this week over getting more take out.

Here's my budget spread. 25M, 34k/yr, Canada. Living with domestic partner.

* Housing: 475
* Transportation: 350 (2 car household, payments on car @ 0% APR)
* Communication: 75
* Grocery: 200
* Retirement: 150
* Recreation: 200
* 1450 Total.

This is one of those things that I have gone back and forth on a lot. I would definitely say that I have a strong emotional affinity towards animals and I recognize that it is not rational at all.

That being said, if there is a rational view that overcomes my emotional reactions I would prefer to go with that. Even though I am aware that I may always have that emotional response, I would prefer to try to be as objective as possible when it comes to moral decisions.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","to be ""fair"" the opposite applies, some parents also don't allow their girls to play with hot wheels.

and i agree, at the time feminism was made, women were treated literally as inferior to men, couldn't vote in the US, had to stay at home, ask permission to go with others, etc. ""men were men and women were women"" so to say (cue that picture of the mustached man ready to fisticuff)

nowadays feminism as it started is less needed, as in there's still sexism that is targetted specifically at women, but in a lot of cases there's also a male equivalent counter-sexism (example is women looked at in a business as a bad investment due to pregnancy, while on the counterside men are expected to work overtime and can't even spend time with their newborn, while society expects him to provide for the family) different issues for both sexes born from the same root.

it also doesn't help that some of the most pushed issues by feminists (i.e: wage gap) are literally illegal and you could sue the company if you had evidence they're paying you less for the same work. so while it may exist (there'll always be a manhater and a womanhater around) the law itself isn't sexist about it, compared to ""women can't vote"" to cite a previous example.

if women need feminism somewhere it's in places like North Korea and certain middle eastern countries where there's ""women code of conducts"" to call them something.",1496275677

Of course, no one entirely chooses who they become. A lot of things are outside of our control, while other things are within our control. What we become is a combination of both that which we control and that which we do not. 

As for help, it's not just about money. It's also about a genuine intention to return these people to a state where they can be healthy, productive and self-reliant. 

Simply giving them medication and disability cheques is not enough. I fear that there is both an industry that thrives on increasing the population of dependent people, and people's own natural inclination to lean on the rest of society, and try to stay on public assistance as long as possible, that combine to create societal inertia toward increasing dependency on government. 

Without some kind of accountability for how the money is spent, I feel like we will gradually see more and more people diagnosed with mental illness, and end up on disability. This hurts both society at large, and the people who grow dependent on these programs.

Indeed if you look over the last 40 years, you see mental illness, drug addiction and public spending on these issues, all have increased. Obviously there's more to the story than the financial resources the government spends on trying to solve the problem, or else the situation in 1960 would have been far worse than today, when there was much less public spending on it.

I don't feel centralized spending decisions, by some provincial government that is run by a handful of politicians, is a sustainable way to deal with the complex challenges of personal development and mental illness that afflict a population of five million people. We need to be creative and find more grass-roots ways to address issues like this. We need more local government, and more organically formed support and guidance systems that are more responsive to individuals and their families, and create accountability by demanding more personal and familial responsibility.

&gt;""according to research, the best place in the world to be a schizophrenic is not North America with all its pharmacopeia, it's a village in Africa or India, where there is acceptance, where people make room for your differentness, where connection is not broken but is maintained....""

While the quote above talks about acceptance, there's another factor I believe that is at work in these small villages where schizophrenia is better dealt with, and that is the individual's family and local community with the power to exert  control over the individual if they start to veer off course, rather than an impersonal legal system and medical/mental-health institutions. 

Beefing up a government run mental health system, which rips people away from their families, and concentrates those struggling in an eight block radius in the DTES filled with drug addicts and drug dealers (and thousands of employees), in the centre of the biggest city in Western Canada, might not be the best solution.",1496275679

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","STOP SPENDING ALL YOUR FUCKING MONEY!!!    
I'm sorry I yelled at you. Come here, sit down. Okay, listen up. This is important.  
I don't care how much money you make or how many bills or how much debt you have. You can get out of debt, stop living month to month, and stop shopping gas prices.   
I guarantee you that there is room in your budget to save money. Instead of alcohol/movies/dinner out, save some of that cash. Pay extra on your highest interest rate debt, when that debt is gone, keep paying that amount on the next debt.    
Example: you have 4 debts. 2,000. 4,000. 7,000. 1,600.    
The highest interest rate is the $1,600 debt. Start paying the cash you save by sitting at home on this debt. Let's say $50 a month, plus the minimum you were already paying, $16.   
Now you pay $66 a month. In 2 years that debt is gone. Now pay the next one off. Let's say the $2,000 debt. You have been paying the minimum ($20) now add the $66. Now you pay $86 a month on that debt. By the time 2 more years pass, you are down to 2 debts and paying an extra $100 a month on them. All a sudden all of your debt is gone you have an extra $200 a month. Start saving that money. Congratulations, next time you lose your job you don't have to go into debt.   
The moral of the story is this. Whatever $ you are earning now is enough to sustain you. When you get a raise or bonus, that money goes into savings. Easiest method is to figure out how much you need and cap your direct deposit at that amount and not raise it for 5 years. $15,000 a year raise? Savings account at a different bank. No withdrawals or transfers. You can be your own lender when times get tough. That money is for loss of income only. You would be amazed how quickly it accumulates.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","&gt;Impeachments are not thrown around. There has to be strong evidence to take that action

Convictions maybe... but actual impeachments? No. You are looking to the past and thinking that what the past was like will be today. Republicans have changed the game to a large degree. At most you would need a good bit of public support and some semblance of guilt to go forward with impeachment in the house. 

&gt;I would even argue if the dems had the house and the senate we are still not at impeachment levels of crime by the trump admin (investigations still pending of course).

We are at those levels, and have been for a while. The only reason the democrats wouldn't have impeached by now is that it's still not done yet, but it would have been much further along. The investigation would have been much further along by now as well as subpoenas up the wazoo. Republicans have dragged their heels to an insane degree, and in some cases actively trying to cover it up themselves and or influence the investigation away at trumps behest. 

&gt;I disagree. Support means you are actively working to improve the president's image. 

No... I as well as the english language and our agreed upon definition of words... disagrees with you. 

http://www.dictionary.com/browse/support

Support means to keep afloat and or agree with, maintain things necessary to existence, etc. 

&gt;That is not happening with the majority of the GOP.

I agree, but thankfully I as well as the dictionary does not agree that would be the definition of support. 

What the republicans are doing are voting for things he proposes, and or going along with it. They are dragging their heels so he's supported in that he's less likely to be impeached and or done so quickly. Again this is likely due to they see him as a useful idiot and want to use him as much as they can to pass what they want and while that happens they support him enough to get it done. 

&gt;They will excuse the mistakes but they are not trying to jump in front of bullets for him.

They are doing it now, not as bad as nunes did but it's still happening. As for nunes career being ruined? No... He's still at it. All he really did was recuse himself, but he still has a voice and still has a career.

&gt;Nobody wants to make the same mistake. They will shake their heads and at the same time say ""well he is still the president"".

Same mistakes? maybe not so much but similar? Absolutely. You may also want to look up the definition of hubris.  With the lies on the right side of the isle at an all time high it's easy to see where they think they can get away with it.

&gt; Hard to believe, but the answer is D. As the law stands now, officers who investigate tips about doctors who write questionable prescriptions can check a monitoring database maintained by the California Department of Justice.

&gt; The patient privacy spin is also coming from the bill&amp;#039;s biggest cheerleader - the California Medical Assn., a powerful lobbying force on behalf of doctors.

&gt; &amp;quot;You&amp;#039;re basically saying law enforcement can&amp;#039;t investigate bad doctors without first establishing probable cause, while at the same time you&amp;#039;re eliminating one of the most effective tools at providing probable cause,&amp;quot; said Niedermann.

**Selling home mess with HVAC repairs.**
&gt;Long story short. I'm selling my house, buyer wants HVAC inspected and any necessary repairs done.  I had a company come out to inspect and tune-up the unit but thought I'd explained that only necessary repairs would be considered. I thought what I was told was that there were no necessary repairs. Now the buyer's agent called the company because of a delay in getting the invoice for the inspection to the buyer. The HVAC company has told the buyer's agent that there were issues and that I told them to not to list them on the invoice.
&gt;  My agent recommends not getting a new company out to inspect the furnace and A/C because it may look like I'm trying to get a company that will just do what I want and not what is needed. However I don't know that I'm comfortable continuing to work with the current company because of the miscommunications that had already occurred.

I don't get it, China does the best job with fighting emissions and investing in renewables.  

Comparing it to the US? China has (or had a few years ago) half the per capita emissions of US http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/per_capita_emissions.png  

China has multiple times the population of the US and they are essentially manufacturing products for everyone on this planet yet they have less than half of cumulative emissions compared to US http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/historical_emissions.png  

What is China's trend? Steady decrease in emission per unit GDP http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2014/05/China%20pollution%20per%20GDP.jpg  

How do China's plans compare to the rest of the world? Nothing special, they just want to do double of what everyone else plans to.  

&gt;So, now that each country has confirmed what it intends to do, which area is planning to make the biggest cuts?
China, which intends to bring down carbon emissions by 60-65 per cent by 2030, comes in first place.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","/u/whiteraven4 and /u/Koksnot explained why the first part isn't correct. There's a second part, disputing as ""contract was canceled"", that needs some explanation too. 

When you dispute a debt, either when getting a notice from a collection agency or through a credit reporting bureau, the collection agency needs to validate the debt in order to continue to attempt to collect or keep the item on your credit report. Sending an initial demand letter costs almost nothing while validating takes and effort on the part of the collection agency and the agency decides whether it is worth putting that effort into the debt, based on how much is owed and how likely they think you will pay. 

It is very possible that the collection agency will make the decision that it isn't worth putting the effort into validating and instead turn around and sell the debt off to another collection agency. The debt doesn't disappear and, in fact, it will likely reappear at some point in the future. 

So, you might think that a dispute that isn't answered makes the debt or negative credit report item go away but it is probably only temporary. ",1496275687

Yes, gaining skills in new areas is great, but it doesn't have a bearing on your job if they are not usable, therefore they are not worth more to your employer to pay you more, since your employer doesn't need your skills in that area. 

18 months isn't job hopping, on average we are talking about 6 months or below. My point is that initially, a new person joining a team is going to be negative expense, until they are trained up and learn to do the job they are hired for. If you leave the company before the company has recouped its costs, then the entire purpose of hiring you as an employee did not net positively. Its basic math.

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","People here focus on Vega and such, but the real story (or stories) from the presentation is this:

1) All the big OEMs are onboard with Ryzen, for systems as well as notebooks. 

2) All the major motherboard makers are fully onboard with TR4 and SP3 (Epyc) boards.

These two things weren't always the case in the past, and certainly back in the old days when AMD was starting it's break through with Athlon, Intel bribed these OEMs to not work with AMD. Intel got fined for it years later, but it damaged AMD's break through as it limited their reach.

This presentation to me, shows that Ryzen, TR and Epyc will have the full support of the AIBs &amp; OEMs and that Intel has to compete with new &amp; better products at better prices instead of shady deals.

3) TR's I/O 64 lanes for all SKUs is a huge deal. Intel markets their X299 as the extreme gaming platform, but it's not extreme until you folk out $1K to be able to fully saturate 2 GPUs since their sub $1K CPUs have 28 lanes or less. All TR SKUs able to go to town on a 2x GPU gaming setup (you know, extreme gaming), or 4x GPU for workstation is a big win.

Oh, I find it strange that AMD went with 2x Vega demo to show off TR's I/O... the 4x Vega workstation would already be enough. It feels like they had to squeeze in Vega gaming just as a commitment due to Raja being overly excited in his AMA.",1496275690

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","Well for one rax has a way quicker auto speed but aside from that I dont really think the strategies to overcome the specs are particularly complex.

For 2 of Rax specs you just anticipate or freedom -&gt; for 2 of Telos specs you just anticipate/freedom+ res for one and surge/escape for the other. Its 1 button for 2 vs 1 button for 1 and 2 buttons for the other, not really much more 'complex'. 

1 Rax mechanic is stop attacking -&gt; 1 Telos mechanic is keep attacking and do more damage 

The specs after phase changes make perfect sense tbh, P2 from p1 you add the magic onslaught spec into the rotation right after the tendril spec, so if you phase it right after tendrils youll get magic onslaught first. P2 to P3 you lose tendrils but the rest stays the same basically. You just need to know the order of specs on the specific phases, and the last spec you did in the previous phase, its not really too hard to remember. Also nothing can legit 1hit you from above like 7k hp (which is anywhere from half to 75% of your max hp depending on gear) until like 600 enrage, and if you had gotten to 600 enrage I doubt youd be complaining about the stuff you are complaining about except the SO MUCH POWER, so unless you are burning freedom for no apparent reason and getting stunned+taking stomp hit on occasion without being able to save yourself from the second hit nothing else should be KOing you

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Important to understand that ""heat"" as you think of it isn't synonymous with temperature. Heat is representative of energy transfer. When you touch something cold, you are losing energy to that object and you feel cold as a result. 

Think about what a freezer is doing. It's keeping contents at a constant temperature. Since the rest of the world isn't at a constant temperature, it needs to constantly be cooling those contents. The tubing you see on the back of a freezer circulate the coolant. 

It's usually snaked all over the back of the freezer to maximize surface area. The coolant, flowing through those tubes, picks up any heat inside the freezer. That heat is dissipated over the greater surface area of the external tubing (back of the freezer). This heat is exchanged with the surrounding air (which is what's giving off heat). Then, the re-cooled coolant flows back through the freezer to continue this process. 

This concept is seen in most cooling systems I can think of off the top of my head. Basically any sort of radiator system includes a circulating component to pick up heat, and a component with large surface area to maximize heat dissipation. ",1496275691

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","To answer your questions:

&gt; Should IS go back to a non sword lord? To this day there are only two lords in the entire series who cannot use swords in any way (Ephraim and Micaiah). Even Kaga didn't make a non sword lord until he made Tear Ring Saga.

I mean, I'd love to see it, and the best weapons IMO would either be magic or lances, axes tend to have too little hit to make the lord hard to train, FE7's axes were just accurate enough, and plus there were plenty of lances to train Hector, as well as his own prologue chapter where it was basically lance land. Having swords is a no-go. having something like a shuriken lord would require shurikens to be rebalanced quite a bit, and having a bow lord would require him to either have insane stats, or some way around the 2 rng lock of bows. So, that leaves Lances, which yes, we have had Ephraim already, but I've stated my reason for not wanting a bow lord despite literally everyone wanting one, and magic lord, which, again, we had Micaiah, but she was bad, and in a game where magic users were the worst in the series, so having a repeat of either would pretty cool IMO.

&gt; should Eliwood have been a lance lord to complete the weapon triangle between Lyn's swords and Hector's axes?

Maybe, or maybe Lyn should've been the lance lord (which, yes, doesn't really make sense contextually, but it could be down with some re-writes), because the main lord has almost always had swords before that, and it was the first game to be released overseas.

&gt; should enemy composition especially early on really focus on axe users? Fates is arguably a step forward given that early game axeland isn't really a thing in all routes.

Fates doesn't need to be axeland because you get access to heart seals super fast to make your lord into whatever you wanted it to be, and even then, there weren't a ton of lance users, but it also wasn't axeland, so... eh, having a magic lord circumvents all that, so I'm in favor of that.",1496275691

While I don't think it's a big deal, it is discriminatory. I never thought we should fix sexism with more sexism.

"comicbookmovies","t5_2qx71","&gt; I wanted to thank you personally for being the first person to resort to ad hominem as opposed to attacking the ideas presented in my writing.

I presented you accusations as false.  The ideas therefore have no merit to begin with.

&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't she a genetically modified ""super spy?""

Not in the MCU, in the comics, and that's a late addition.

&gt; It's been 7 years since she made her debut and people were bound to ask about her getting a film.

Yeah, they've been asking for like 6 1/2 years actually.  You're not plowing new earth here with that request.  Films take years of development and are planned far into the future. In the case of the MCU, they planned out a decade beforehand.  As you say, we're 8 years in, and we're checking all the boxes in films to come.  Also, like I said, TV counts for me.  Jessica and Luke count for me, more so than even the films do.  I also do not understand the fetish over the brass ring of the title.  I'm seeing Ragnarok for Hulk.  Marvel has female heroes a plenty: Carters, Widow, Gamora, Mantis, Scarlet Witch, Jessica Jones, Syf, Quake/May/Simmons as well as Wasp and Captain Marvel coming soon. And that's without the X-Men or FF under their pervue.

&gt; I'm aware of all of this. 

If you were aware of it, why act like she's a character historically on par with the others?  Her comic roles are often like the films, she pops up for the government.

&gt; Did you really need to write a dissertation just to downvote?

Nope, that was just for fun.  Dust off the ol' critical analysis skills from my english/journalism degree.  Doesn't get much use in sales these days, but still fun to do.  I did actually appreciate your research, it wasn't sarcasm.  You started off well, then devolved into the generic identity politics drivel the takes great pains to ignore all the things that have been done so it can complain about pet issues that have not been.  It's all ""but movies"" and a complete disavowal of other mediums as valid forms.  What is so special about a movie compared to a TV show?

&gt; I'll leave you to work out your issues on your own.

Which is way more polite than working them out on your blog...

Countless times people who have played too aggressively early in the game have come nowhere close to winning in part due to that. Second, sheer odds say that one is less likely to win comps early on because there are so many people and because unless you're winning HOH or getting nominated, odds of you even playing for veto are slim until the numbers are reduced quite a bit. Big Brother is a game where many of the key strategic moves one can make require a comp win to make it happen.",1496275698

"optometry","t5_2shdt","Hello. Optometrist in Texas.
This RX is mainly ment for night driving and seeing fine detail as you are very minimally near-sighted. Second, I think your issues with the glasses are more related to binocular balance based of the explanation for why you cant wear the glasses.


Binocular balance is the idea that given the ideal RX for glasses the focusing muscle for both eyes is contributing equally for distance and near vision. Sometimes what happens with new RX's is the binocular balance can be off meaning one eye might be contributing more or less to vision in each eye. In your case the OD right eye.


Symptoms of poor binocular balance include but are not limited to: eyestrain, fatigue, headaches, double vision, and occasionally decreased vision. I want you to try putting on your glasses and looking as far away as you can. NEXT cover your left eye and pay close attention to the vision in the right eye, if it feels like your eye is sorta zooming in and out to refocus the balance is off. Repeat by covering the right eye at distance and checking left eye. Next do the same thing for a reading distance (40cm) and pay attention to which eye might be trying to refocus after the other is closed.

I think the writers didn't have a good plan for Nick/Jess after they got together in S3 but they should have dealt with their breakup in a more realistic way than having them living together as exes. They probably just felt like everyone was just sick of Nick/Jess by then though. S6 just felt like a season too late for them to get back together and the Nick/Reagan arc felt really unnecessary, especially when Megan Fox couldn't even be there for most of it to push the arc forward in the first half of S6.

x265 is more recent.. It's a lot smaller than x264 however it takes more effort to create but results in that smaller filesize using some newer optimization techniques (It works incredibly well on Cartoons/Anime with their static backgrounds and smooth animation/movement, and still very well on Live action movies and TV too) 

However h265 takes more effort to playback as well so some older devices like an iPhone 3G for example may struggle to decode/play it back and you'll find lots of TVs/DTVs/Media player devices that plug into the TV, will throw an error trying to play it because they aren't compatible with this new format.",1496275701

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","You should always run a session 0 which includes going over the party to make sure that they have similar goals and want to work together towards the same ends. Typically I've found when I play in groups that don't bother to make sure the party is set up to work together there will always be at least one character who doesn't really fit in and will let the other characters die (although the player themselves might act out of character as to not let that happen). I don't recommend making a party that will fight amongst itself unless that's the kind of campaign you want (I did see you're playing an evil game, so that may be true), it's just going to lead to drama and sessions where little progresses because no one wants to work together.

And yes it's okay to play out of character to save anthers life, but you shouldn't have to do that if you're playing the game as a collaborative game (as D&amp;D is) because your character would already do those things.

You should always put the parties enjoyment over role playing. If the way anyone in your party is going to take away from the game for another player then they need to change how they play, because it's just going to kill the group (both in game and out of game).

You should find another group if your presence is causing drama, however, things aren't going to get better unless you think you can talk it through and get past everything.",1496275702

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I personally find the ""reverse Pascal's wager"" to be more illuminating: If there is no metaphysical judge of our actions and there is no afterlife in which to suffer punishment or receive a reward for our actions in life, why behave morally?

Sure, it behooves you to be perceived as kind and sociable in life in order to reap the benefits of a positive reputation, but why shouldn't you plot and scheme behind the scenes in order to get what you want and increase your own power until you no longer need to hide behind the mask of righteousness and bind yourself with calculated restraint? Why not lie and cheat and break your promises so long as you tell the truth, follow the rules, and keep your word often enough with the right people at the right times in order to increase your own power? Why not exploit 90% of your peers if doing so enables you purchase the loyalty of the other 10% and that is sufficient to maintain a stable totalitarian society and a lavish life for you and your cronies? And if that fails, why not destroy the whole world when it becomes clear that your own world is about to be destroyed?

Why shouldn't you live a fast and fiery life of pleasure and power instead of a plodding, boorish life of duty and ""honor"" and morality? We're all going to die in the end; the worms do not judge the corpses in the dirt. You only live once, and it's a short, miserable life unless you take what you want from it. Don't endure a lifetime's worth of meaningless suffering because you believe that some ""god"" is going to punish or reward you for your behavior after death.

Everyone complains about taxes or thinks that tax money isn't being spent on the right things, but the only people who show up to vote on tax referenda are those who will directly benefit.

I've seen open source projects on Patron pulling in cash just fine. Maybe it's because it's really early, but I'd still like Linux builds, closed or open source. I like that the majority of other emulators are open since you can use the code for studying hardware and emulation. It's also important for game preservation since hardware and physical media can degrade badly enough to become unsuitable for actually using them. Keeping it closed makes it trickier for museums and whatnot from using the emulator due to any weird licensing issues that may exist or arise. If development died and the code can't be accessed or recovered by other parties, then there isn't any way to maintain the codebase for future modern systems. You'd either need to keep future old hardware around to run the emulator or emulate the future old hardware to run the emulator. I can understand the desire to keep the source closed and more tightly managed, especially considering they weren't interested in pull requests of any sort for whatever reason. They could still develop it open and keep a no pull request policy if they wanted.

Studied harder in college. Applied to every place that needed a extra set of hands. When the time came, I went home, to help take care of my grandmother. She may as well have been a saint, a saving grace for a man like me. I watched her illness take her. It took over a year. I didn't think much about my choices. Everybody said I did the right things to do of course. Everything happens for a reason.

 And yet, here I was at 30; destitute, sleeping out of my car between shifts at a call center, barely floating above homelessness. Mind you, I had done all the things they tell you to do. Be healthy. Study hard. Work harder. If a field doesn't work out for you, go into a trade. Pull yourself up by those bootstraps.

""Kenneth; can I speak to you for a moment?"" The boss asked me.

We studied each other for silence under the dim lights in the office. The dingy little thing sat above the floor in the main building. You could see everything from up here.

""I've been telling the guys one by one."" He spoke, ""And well, it's the least I can do. The guys in corporate came down. They said our branch is one of the older ones in the chain. And well... They're closing the center.""

""Closing?"" I realized numbly.

""Yeah. Some kind of political nonsense. You know how people are these days Ken. Nobody ever wants to make a actual good decision. So, we're all getting let go. They're shutting us down next week. People are going to start going home this Thursday coming up...""

""I see.""

--

So here I am, for once, drowning my sorrows at some dive on the other end of town. I never was much of a drinker. But I am now.

""So you got let go Ken?"" Will asked me. He took a minute to pull off the beer in front of him for a minute. ""I'm sorry. Real sorry, Ken. You gave it a good run. Hey Big Hawk; get my brother another whisky sour. He earned it.""

""I don't get it man."" I began.

""Don't get what Kenny?"" Will asked between sips. He took the time to take another shot at the pool table. Unfortunately, he chipped the cue ball; ruining his turn.

""Being a good person doesn't get you anything, I swear.""

""C'mon, Ken don't be like that."" Will chuckled, ""You can't change things.""

""I know that."" Ken said, ""It's just funny to me. All these years, I've watched it happen time and time again. If you're bitchy, rude, selfish, or cold, somehow it gets you places.""

""Yeah, nowhere good."" Will laughed mockingly.

""I'm serious."" I spilled. ""People take and take and take... And people like me and you, mom, dad... We just get shafted. Every *fuckin'* time. With out fail. I mean Christ, we don't even have to do much. Just go to the park at lunch time and smoke a joint or something. Jail. Take a slice of pizza at the gas station without paying. Jail. Get hurt, oh what's that? You don't have good insurance? Bankrupt. You didn't go to college and get that fancy degree? Sucks to be you!""

""Calm down Ken. I get it your upset, but you've got your whole life of you. Just have some more drinks. Maybe hook up with a girl or something, it'll be fine.""

""No fuck that!"" I interrupted. ""All I want to do is get *paid.* Be good at the right thing. For once. Nothing more, nothing less.""

Will studied me for a minute in silence. I guess I probably looked a bit stupid; some nerd in a cheap suit flipping out in the back of a biker bar. But eventually Will did nod in agreement at my predicament. Seeing as he lost his job at a factory two years ago, I've wondered how he keeps at it himself.

""Tell you what?"" Will asked as he ditched the pool cue on the table. ""I might be able to cut you in on something.""

""Yeah?""

""Yeah."" Will smirked, until he spoke quietly ""It's a different thing than what you're used to though. I don't know if it's something you're up for, so it's a lil' sketchy to talk about in the open.""

""What kind of job is it?"" I inquired.

""I'm in the transportation business. So to speak. We relocate assets for clientele. Some of the sellers can be... A bit combative, but the hours aren't terrible. Pays okay too.""

""Are they open now?"" I asked, ""I could fill out the app online.""

""Actually, my boss prefers to interview in person."" Will explained, ""I'd have to take you over there tomorrow morning. Besides, he's a colorful guy. I don't think you'll get on his nerves or anything.""

--

*Meanwhile, across town.*

""GIMME THE FUCKING CASH! C'MON!"" Carti said as he waved the rifle.

""We can explain. We were gonna' pay you!"" The man on the floor explained.

""Yeah, after that setup in the oil fields?? I'm not stupid- Freddy, I mean it man, if you move I'll pin you to the wall with this thing! STAY PUT!""

""Okay! Okay! Just don't do it!"" Freddy said as he sunk back into the tiles, ""Give him the bag, Linda. Give it too him.""

""Slide it over man, let's go."" Carti motioned as he aimed at her. Her hands trembled as she slid the money into the duffel. She zipped it quickly, and let it glide across the marble.

""Don't ask for my services again! I'm canceling our business agreement."" Carti mentioned as he backed out of the room. Running down the stairs past the pool, he flicked the bag and gun into the trunk of the car. A quick snap of the keys and he was out onto the side streets, the mansions quietly slipping by. Absently, he checked his voicemail as he drove.

""Hey Cart, it's Will. I've got a guy here who could help with inventory, he's cool. Can I introduce him tomorrow?""

--

*Back at the bar.*

""Hey Ken, let's go. He wants to meet you."" Will said as he nudged me at the bar.

""I thought you said tomorrow morning."" I mentioned. Will just flashed the phone and pointed at the time.

""It *is* tomorrow morning.""",1496275705

""You can't say that there aren't upsides to nuclear power indeed, but part of reddit is just hyping it because science wow so awsum. And some of the arguments suggesting that the fears are irrational are just ignorant. 

Like hey, even though the accidents it never killed people right? As if thousands who are marked for life because they were exposed to unhealthy amounts of radiations don't matter.

Ok, but coal and oil kill and sicken so many more people! Well yeah that's right, but for one we usually talk cleaner alternatives and not freaking fossile fuel, and furthermore at least coal and oil plants can be shut down and then the area will be kinda safe again, which you can't say about Chernobyl or Fukushima.

Well but this were just extremely unlikely accidents! Also technically correct, but a zero point something possibility of an accident is not that little in a world were several hundret reactors already exist. Not to mention that we had some major and more minor accidents only some decades into the use of a technology which biggest proposed advantage is to deliver energy for thousands of years.

I know that the alternatives are not perfect, and that there are good points pro nuclear energy. But producing electric energy is a matter of basic supply, and thus important enough that we can be sensitive and not accept such a colleteral damage. I don't want to accept sacrificing lives and whole areas in the long run when we have safer alternatives.""

*****
&gt; At least nine police officers were injured as violent clashes between students and police broke out in the German city of Nurnberg when a group of students tried to block the deportation of an Afghan fellow learner.

&gt; Protesters pelted the police officers, who arrived at the scene, with bottles and even &amp;quot;Threw bicycles&amp;quot; at them, a spokesman of the regional police department told the German media.

&gt; &amp;quot;Over time, more and more people joined the crowd, including sympathizers as well as just onlookers. Police repeatedly called on the people to disperse for several hours but the protesters did not comply and refused to clear the road forcing [police] to engage,&amp;quot; Bert Rauenbusch, a spokesman for the regional police department, told Bavarian Radio.

It's true that there's A LOT going on at any one time in this game, and can get overwhelming at times. However, the overarching story and theme are gripping and kept me interested the whole way through.

Every time you encounter a new alien race and they join your settlement, seeing them sprinkled among the populace and interacting with them really makes you feel the progress you're making. It immerses you in the setting wonderfully.

There are lots of characters, and not all of them are winners. But you'll definitely find yourself getting attached to a few. Maybe not as much as the original Xenoblade Chronicles, especially due to the silent protagonist (rarely a good idea as far as I'm concerned), but the connection is there.

Gameplay is basically like a single player MMO. I don't like MMOs much, but I got lots of enjoyment from the battle system here. Your mileage may vary, of course, but it definitely works and isn't clunky.

Frankly, my biggest criticism is that, while the main story does ultimately get resolved, the game ends on a cliffhanger suggesting a larger scale, and the unfortunate bit is that the cliffhanger will likely never be resolved. But for what it is, I personally think this game is worth it, especially at this price.",1496275713

"AskThe_Donald","t5_3fuwj","I didn't say that Hannity backing off disproves Seth Rich, I said that it sucked the wind out of the sails of the Seth Rich issue. There isn't any real evidence supporting the story, so the only thing that keeps it alive is people talking about it, and pushing it out from the internet and into higher profile media outlets. In this sense Hannity's advocacy was the high water mark for the whole movement, and when he distanced himself it hurt the momentum The_Donald, 4chan and others had drummed up. Hannity stepped back weeks ago, and now look at the state of the Seth Rich story...nothing new, zero evidence corroborated, all quiet at The_Donald, much less exposure in the MSM, etc.

Everyone knows that the Seth Rich story is embraced by Trump supporters because it provides a counter-narrative to the Russia scandal (Hannity himself admitted this). This is why people are upset about it: not because it might be true, but because it seems fake and draws attention away from Trump's potentially very real crimes. Trump supporters tend to create a false equivalency between Seth Rich and the Russia scandal; you often hear them say that there is approximately the same amount of evidence for each, so if you entertain the notion that the Trump administration collaborated with Russia to influence the election, you must also entertain the idea that Seth Rich was the real source of the DNC leaks. This isn't even close to being a fair comparison, but accepting it does muddy the truth and make it difficult to understand what is really happening--which is the entire purpose of 'fake news' and 100% in line with what we understand about Russian propaganda efforts. So I guess I would pose your own question back at you: if nothing ever comes of the Seth Rich story, will you ever admit you were suckered into believing a bogus story designed to confuse the truth and deflect criticism from Trump?",1496275715

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; No need to state it. You can put it in yourself.

Not so. Inputting it into a smartphone is still providing information, the same way that writing or typing a confession is providing information. However, this is a good point, and it's why some judges have ruled police can force you to unlock a device with your fingerprint - *that* is a lot more like turning a key - but not a password. 

&gt; Hairsplitting is what happens when guilty people argue the law. If you're not guilty, you don't have to hairsplit. If you are well within your rights as stated, there's no need to split hairs. I can't think of a reason. But maybe you can give me an example.

Innocent people get convicted, put in jail, and even executed all the time. These protections - the constitution - are so that will be minimised or, ideally, avoided. 

Imagine you are falsely accused of raping a woman at a party. In your testimony you testify that you left the party at 10:30, and that's honestly what you remember. A witness had said the rape happened more near 11. The prosecution says you sent a text at 10:48pm from the location of the party - you live a mile away. Why did you lie? What are you covering? This damages your testimony to the jury. Of course, you genuinely thought you had left the party around 10:30. But by now it's been weeks, and memory can fail you. The prosecution also finds photos at the party of you looking very drunk. This damages your testimony to the jury. They may find some comments/posts on Reddit which they deem to be sexist (haven't looked through your profile, it's a hypothetical). They use all of this to build a character. Maybe, if you have a good defence lawyer and not an overworked public defender, they get that thrown out because the warrant only covered your phone, whereas comments/posts are stored on the Reddit server, uncovered by the warrant. Maybe not. 

Are you telling me there is no way *all* that information stored on your phone can't be used to paint an inaccurate and possibly incriminating picture? 

The worst crime I've ever committed is drug possession. I am sure all the information on my phone could be used to aid in the building of a case for a worse crime, even if I didn't do it. 

We *all* need protection from the law. 

&gt; Yes. But it's already in the law as precedent in other cases. 

Yes. Exactly. [Virginia Circuit Court Judge Steven C. Frucci](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/11/03/police-can-demand-fingerprints-but-not-passcodes-to-unlock-phones-rules-judge/) ruled that police can only force a fingerprint scan, not a password, because of what I've just said. Quote from article:

What a load of horse shit. Did you read what you wrote? It barely makes sense and the bottom part is fucking retarded. What the fuck does this have to do with being right or gaining knowledge and understanding? You should probably stop using most of your chemicals. You seem hypomanic. Agitation, lashing out for no reason and writing shit that barely make any sense are signs of that. You hope I die because I don't want to buy from you. What the fuck is wrong with you.",1496275716

I like these changes a lot and I don't think it's going to dislodge him too much. I love that missing shots is more forgiving now with the increased fire rate/clip size.

Maybe everyone should play a few games as him before jumping to conclusions....

Edit: okay yeah I kinda see it now. I think if they were intending to pull his playstyle away from a one hit combo then they need to reduce hook cooldown and increase the clip size a bit more.

Ocean: Tsunami (Huge damaging wave sweeps slowly across massive part of ocean) 

Whirlpool (Basically a water tornado) 

Sea Storm (Random lightning strikes come down but with a 3 second yellow area warning)


Arctic: Ice Age (all map becomes ice)

 Avalanche (Ice flies from the top of the screen and comes down in sheets)

 Warming (all parts that aren't ice become ocean)



Volcano: Eruption (Basically a lava sea storm (lighting strikes are flaming rocks)

I havent started shopping for my dress yet, but in August 2015 i went to buy my Bridesmaid Dress for my brother's wedding.  I tried on the one my SIL liked in the size suggested, but it felt loose in the top and the material was stretchy so I asked to try on one size smaller.

After trying on the smaller size, I was torn between what to buy since the wedding wasnt for another 10 months (They told my sister in law it would take 6 months to get the dressed... it took 2 but thats another story) Well my SILs mom told me the smaller size looked better and I should stop worrying and get it.  The attendant , who apparently couldn't hold back what she wanted to say, goes ""Don't do that you'll probably gain weight!""

Well guess what I went with the smaller size and it fit jsut fine, so fine in fact that all the girls who got talked into a larger size needed alterations.

If you love the mermaid gown rock it, first you have plenty of time to take any weight off that you do or do not want to take off, and more than likely you ill have an undergarment that will hide any tummy you are insecure about. For get them it's about what makes you feel beautiful!",1496275721

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Im not in the UK (Australia actually) but as far as I understand it a 401K is basically a tax-qualified, defined-contribution pension account. With a 401k a retirement savings contributions are provided (and sometimes proportionately matched) by an employer, deducted from the employee's paycheck before taxation, and limited to a maximum pre-tax annual contribution of USD$18,000. I do not think they're compulsory. In Australia we have a similar system called Superannuation, but it is compulsory. They're both basically private pensions - savings accounts where the savings are diversely invested. Both systems give you a decent amount of control over what you are invested in, allowing you to reduce risk as you approach retirement. Our super system does not allow withdrawals until you hit a preservation age (for me it is 60). This is to stop people pulling their money out early and thus ending up buggered for their actual retirement. The whole system is meant to take the burden off the government, and get us lay people to fund our own retirement. Fair enough in my books.

I have no idea if the UK has a similar system but my cursory Google search says it's just your Pension system. No idea if you can contribute more or less, if it's matched, and what beneficial tax treatments (if any) you receive as a result. Google also tells me you can thank Thatcher for not having a similar system like the US and Australia, whatever that means.

It would be easy for you to start your own investments with a similar goal. There are some existing funds out there that are set up purely for retirement, like *Vanguard's Target Retirement Fund* for example. I doubt it would be as good as a proper system, but it'd be a start. An alternative would be to just start buying and holding long term shares, like ETFs.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Since this is such a niche subject, I could only find [one study](http://www.vegepets.info/resources/Publications/Veg-cats-Wakefield-et-al-JAVMA-2006.pdf) from 2006 on it. It was relatively small but almost all the cats involved had optimal bloodwork and none were deficient. The author suggests some probable causes relating to the cats' diets.
&gt; Blood taurine concentrations were within reference
&gt; range for most of the cats tested. However, 3 cats
&gt; had blood taurine concentrations between the reference
&gt; range and the critical concentration, suggesting
&gt; that their dietary intake was marginal, but that they
&gt; were not clinically deficient. Possible explanations for
&gt; this include variation in cats’ individual diets, such as
&gt; the addition of table scraps and treats (all 3 received
&gt; either or both), and potential quality assurance issues
&gt; affecting manufacture of the diets. The manufacturers
&gt; of these diets are small companies that make individual
&gt; batches as needed. All 3 cats with blood taurine
&gt; concentrations &lt; 300 nmol/mL were kept strictly
&gt; indoors, did not receive vitamin supplements, and
&gt; were reported as healthy by the caregivers
The author seems to conclude that nutritionally adequate veg*an diets for cats can be perfectly healthy which answers your question of ""Are cats able to maintain the same level of health and longevity when fed a vegan diet as opposed to an omnivorous/carnivorous one?""

In relation to your first point, what we feed cats today is not ""what they were designed to eat"". Commercial cat food typically contains many ingredients that wouldn't be a part of a cat's natural diet such as corn, wheat, soy, egg, flax, rice and various types of vegetable oil. The difference between vegan and non-vegan cat food isn't as drastic as you'd think.

In relation to your last point, I think most people would agree that finding an ethical and sustainable diet for cats is preferable to not doing so or letting them go extinct. And I think it's clear from the study above that cat's, absolutely, don't ""need meat to survive"".",1496275723

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","Its far too early to call the status of road hog, I read an intresting analysis from u/I_GIVE_ROADHOG_TIPS on this matter that made some excellent points


&gt;
Let's not be too hasty with our meta predictions. The changes to Roadhog here are complex and interconnected. It's not simply a matter of number crunching to figure out who Road can and can't one-shot after the Hook.
&gt;
The Hook combo is undoubtedly weaker, but the other aspects of the Hook are still strong. The Hook is still a 20m stun with displacement mechanics that sets up the target to eat big damage on a 8s cooldown, which is still among the best abilities in the game.
&gt;
The new fire rate is faster than you think. Take a look at this clip:https://gfycat.com/MiniatureExhaustedCardinal
&gt;
 Hog's matchup against slippery heroes like Tracer has improved quite a bit with this patch, no longer being heavily Tracer-favoured without the Hook available. In addition, you may not be able to one-shot a lot of heroes after the Hook, but if you've placed the hero correctly (such that their escape is going to be difficult), you should still be able to get the follow-up shot to finish them off. Which leads me to my next point:
&gt;
 The addition of an extra shot in his magazine, on top of making his fire rate faster, gives a skilled Road more agency over the distribution of his burst damage which is undoubtedly a buff. Road's damage may have been lowered but it is still strong. This makes his matchups against a group of enemies as strong as the Roadhog player's aim and skill in estimating damage. This also buffs the Right-click xx Hook Cancel xx Left-click combo, since you get an extra shot to light up the enemy with before the fight.
&gt;
The 20% reduction in head hitbox means Take A Breather is much stronger than before. Roadhog's sustain, especially against certain heroes like a long-range Soldier, has improved with this change. Not only will he be able to duel heroes more effectively, but doing the 180 heal trick will lead to more health recovered since the buff is effectively 20% less critical damage taken. Recall how big changing Winston's head hitbox by just 15% was.
&gt;
In closing, I'm not saying these changes are not an overall nerf to Roadhog's effectiveness in high level play. Blizzard is trying to move Road away from being a one-shotting machine to actually dueling people, which is evident in their previous change of lowering Road's spread and making Hook's cooldown longer. In my opinion, this is a good move. It's not simply a matter of number crunching to figure out who Road can and can't one-shot after the Hook.

TBMs are boring (hence the name) but if he can make it seem like a flashy futuristic pitch he'll get more investment money to get this company off the ground.

    int char_to_int(char c)
    {
      return static_cast&lt;int&gt;(c - '0');
    }
    
    void peekMove(const std::string&amp; move)
    {
      int row = char_to_int(move[0]);
      int column = char_to_int(move[1]);
      // then print
    }

It assumes that the row and column are one character only, and splits the string on that basis, converting only a single character to a number.

The conversion to int is dirty but simple - chars are represented as numbers, '0' is 48, '1' is 49, etc, '9' is 57. So we can subtract chars and all we're doing is subtracting their numerical representation: '9' - '0' = 57 - 48 = 9. So in general 'c' - '0' = c for some number c between 0 and 9. This could benefit from error checking as any character other than the ten digits as input would produce nonsense. 

If you want to handle rows and columns bigger than that you'd have to use a different approach, but they're overkill for stuff like chessboards. Decent practice for string handling though!",1496275726

Waitressing/bartending will be fine, but I think you'd still see slight job losses as certain functions get automated.

For example, our Conservative party here in Canada would never think about touching our universal healthcare system, it's political anathema. The conservatives are also usually wise enough to stay out of the issues of abortion and gay marriage. We only get more liberal from there, mostly, and that already feels like it's quite left of your republicans. Our Liberal party would be seen as socialist commie tax-n-spend big gubmin't villains in America, and we gave them a majority a couple years ago. And then there's the *actual* left wing parties, which traditionally try to be even more liberal than our Liberals, such as the NDP, who gain genuine traction in various parts of the country.

De opfører sig på samme måde overfor andre grupper der er overrepræsenteret i den slags kriminalitet. Forståelse er ligegyldigt, for vi har 0 ansvar overfor andre mennesker, andet end at ikke udøve vold og lignende, og ellers betale skat osv.. voldtægter er f.eks. steget fra ca. 300 til ca. 600 årligt, over to år. Selvfølgelig er mange bange. Hvis du ikke kan lide det, så snak med folk så de skifter mening og bliver tryggere, og ellers ved alle godt, at de fleste er helt normale mennesker. Jeg har da selv venner og tidligere kollegaer fra Mellemøsten... Men altså - flere af mine venners så en etnisk dansker blive jagtet igennem en sidegade på Nørrebro af 100-200 mænd...det er sgu da ikke normalt. Det stammer fra frygt og frustration.

Roasted carrot mash is also a delicious side for a main dish.

I've kicked heroin, suboxone, oxy and methadone and I'm telling you from first hand experience kratom withdrawal isn't much easier. It's fucking terrible. A lot of the people who talk about how easy the withdrawals are have only used recreationally, for a few months or once in a blue moon. Anyone who's been on kratom daily for longer than 5 months or so is in for a world of hurt. I was only on it for roughly 9 months. After about 6 months it turned on me, began having more anxiety and depression/anger outbursts, eventually at around 7 months I began waking up every morning in withdrawal at around 4 am.

Saying the withdrawals are mild and no big deal is reckless. That's how I ended up on it. Everyone told me it was safe and had mild withdrawals. Boy was that some bullshit. Can't sleep worth crap when your whole body is restless and aching, diarrhea, panic attacks, insomnia that lasts weeks, it was terrible. The only way real opiates was worse was due to vomiting.

But I feel it didn't actually succeed as well as other horror films in accomplishing that goal.

Let's look at some other recent horror films that actually establish a thematic connection between metaphysical, fantastical horror and the horrors of real life they are meant to represent.

* *The Witch*: it's about Puritanical superstition and a young girl's rejection of it, so the antagonists are the Devil and a witch. Both of which come to be intimately associated with the protagonist as well. This checks out extremely well, because everything ties back specifically to Thomasin and her main conflict.
* *It Follows*: it's about various sexual stigmas, and therefore the monster evokes sexual discomfort and generally kills people in a sexual manner. There are other, less coherent things about this film, but the central concept is tight.
* *The Taking of Deborah Logan*: it's about how people suffering from dementia/Alzheimer's can change in personality, with a snake motif. So the titular character is possessed by a different personality that morphs her into a snake-woman. Maybe a bit arbitrary, but still coherent.

These also have pretty great cinematography. For horror films, anyway. And I'd argue all have better ""horror"" moments, and more of them. But that's sort of irrelevant to my point.

*The Babadook* doesn't have this sort of thematic consistency. It doesn't look like grief or depression; it looks terrifying and murderous. It doesn't sound right either, since both the special effects and the very name are silly more than scary. And neither depression nor grief are pants-shittingly scary or laughably ridiculous. The representation is frankly awful at conveying what it represents.

The closest explanation for why Amelia's problems manifest in this particular form is the kid's pop-up book and some old horror flicks, but neither of those share any specific traits with Amelia's personal conflict. It's like representing my fear of abandonment with Jessica Lange, or my disappointment in my lack of coordination with a spoiled cheese sandwich. Nothing, absoluting nothing, about the Babadook relates to, conveys information about, or builds meaning around the character of Amelia. And yet it should, if the clearly intended interpretation is that it represents her grief/depression.

There is a thin counterargument I can imagine to my discontent, which is that the Babadook can be arbitrary with respect to Amelia because many people irrationally appropriate imagery in contexts where it makes no sense. If it's just a manifestation of Amelia's mind, who are we to judge the logical coherency of her imagination? To which I say: that's fine, but it still amounts to a lazy cop-out when filming a story, and actually removes depth from the film rather than adds to it. I have less reason to rewatch this film, less insight I can gain from it, since I gave up trying to explain this fundamental disconnect and instead accepted it for what it is: lazy, unpolished writing.

*Babadook* is overrated. Come at me bros.",1496275739

That sort of pace difference cannot be down to the drivers alone. In Monaco, Lewis was never able to post a time faster than his FP1 time. You could see how merely keeping it out of the barriers was a huge ask. Ted confirmed from the pitwall that the engineers took a mid weekend change of direction with the setup, and thay made the car terrible, but they started working their way back, and did not figure it out untill quali, where they could not so anything because of Parc Ferme. Merc has been stayning tight lipped though, which is understandable, considering how fans get. The Video I linked yesterday with Nico confirming all this and saying he is not allowed to say more has even been taken down. Anyway, point is, both mercs were obviously running on different setups in Soshi and Monaco, there is no way a driver can perform well when the setup is that shit. He showed his adaptability in getting the hang of it such that on the harder tyres (since the car was massively overactivating the rears, it would get better with harder tyres), he was able to be fastest at a certain stage. Which was only possible because the balance at that point (harder rear tyres) permitted him to. The car is the ultimate decider, man. Then setup. Then the driver.

we have paper ballots throughout FL. i'm pretty sure i have never cast a vote  that was truly counted in my county, broward, that wasn't for a prop.

optical readers of paper ballots have been rigging elections since the late 1980s.

recounts are only allowed in limited situations and only a candidate may request it. the recount will just run the ballots through the readers again. getting a hand recount is virtually impossible.

you have to revamp the whole system. make the precints smaller and easier to manage. hire and train staff. no volunteers. everyone in the polling place wears a gopro hat. ballots are kept locked up until the morning after the last precinct in the election closes (in nationwide elections this would be hawaii). begin the count by hand in every precinct simultaneously, live streamed and recorded so that anyone watching can count along. totals are only reported on the precinct level. tne final official statewide count can be done by anyone with a calculator. allow any citizen of the state to call for a recount up to 6 weeks from the election for anyreason. and even then there will still be cheating. 

election fraud moves up from biased poll workers tossing and voiding ballots to tampere-with optical readers to precinct captains phoning in inaccurate counts to county supervisors reporting fraudulent countywide counts to secs of state massaging final official counts.

Also, if you can get a DMA textbook (PM me if you need help finding this) and read that a bit you'd be ahead of the game. As for the DCF, there is a specific way you create one in finance so better to just learn it in class (its not that hard). Brush up on your excel if you arent comfortable with it. And maybe learn about some industries like financing and consulting and some of the tools they use that you can bring up in class conversations. Other courses are more qualitative so cant really prep for that. I'd say just relax and focus on recruiting if you're going for a banking job.

"neopets","t5_2r64t","I realized that basically the only way I was losing was having the Light icons from my Yooyu Knuckle Dusters reflected by the Ice Mirror. I was caught up in trying to kill him in one turn by having 28+ icons with the 14 icon weapons, but it was doing more harm than good.

So I'm at Level 28, 50 HP, 55 Str, 45 Def and I don't have Lens Flare. Apparently at level 50 with Lens Flare this is all moot because you can one-shot him easily, but I'm not there yet, and I assume you're not either. For reference, 55 is a threshold where icons go from dealing 1.5 damage each to 2 damage each, so this probably won't work unless you're also at that threshold. 

So instead of trying to kill him in one turn, I just use Scroll of Ultranova, purely because I already had it equipped and it dealt fewer light icons. His shields don't block Fire or Water, so if you have a weapon that deals those, use that. In my case, the Scroll of Ultranova plus An Icicle does more than 50% damage consistently. I pair it with the Parasol of Unfortunate Demise, which blocks the Light icons from the Zapatron 4000 and some of the Water icons from the Decorative Maractite Sword. I use those until I get below 20 HP, and then I swap the Parasol for a Helm of Recovery, which is a full heal for me. Alternately, I'll use the Helm to heal if he's almost dead and I haven't used it yet. If he's at like 5, I'll use the Parasol and the Helm to try to preserve as much HP as possible for the next go and kill him with just the Icicle. As a side note, An Icicle is great against him, because again, he can't block Water icons.

An ideal game is to use the Scroll of Ultranova + Parasol of Infinite Demise + An Icicle from above 20 HP. That gets him below 50% HP. Then I switch to Scroll of Ultranova + Helm of Recovery + An Icicle, and he dies while I ideally full heal for the next round.",1496275746

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","You apparently didn't read my example in the other thread on this comment. Let's try that again.

Let's say you have a ship that is 1 light year away, and is going to fly to you at 50% the speed of light. For you, this will take 2 years, right? I'm sure we can agree on that part.

So, it starts moving toward you at time t=0 years for you. Now, what do you see? Nothing yet, because the light you're seeing from him is from time t=-1 years since he's a light year away. In fact, you won't see him start moving until time t=1 year, since that's how long it takes the light from his moment of departure to reach you. In all that time it looks like he's just sitting there (assuming he wasn't doing anything up to that point).

So, at t=1 you see him start moving toward you, but he's already been flying to you for a year, so he's actually 0.5 ly away at that moment. But you won't see him at 0.5ly away until 0.5 years later, at t=1.5 years. So, at t=1, he looks like he's 1ly away, and at t=1.5, he looks like he's 0.5 ly away. But at t=1.5 he's actually only 0.25ly away. But you won't see him at that distance until 0.25y later, at t=1.75y. Now, when he arrives at your location you'll see that immediately because he's right there. So here is the breakdown:

at t=0, he's at 1ly moving toward us, we see him at 1ly away

at t=1, he's at 0.5ly, but we see him still at 1ly and starting to move

at t=1.5 he's at 0.75ly but we see him at 0.5ly

at t=1.75 he looks like he's at 0.75ly

at t=2 he arrives.


From our viewpoint, he crossed the distance of a light year in only 1 year, so it looks like he was traveling at the speed of light. If we use the multiplier, we have 1/(1-0.5) which is 2. Multiply his speed, 0.5ly/y by 2 to get 1. In addition, we will see the 1.73 years that elapse on a clock on his ship during that journey pass in 1 year, so it looks like his clock is ticking faster, by the multiplier above (2) divided by the Lorentz factor.

When moving away from us the opposite effect happens. IF he was going from us to a location 1ly away at 0.5c, he would get there in 2 years, but we wouldn't see him arrive there until a year after that, so it would look like the trip took him 3 total years to us, which looks like 0.33c. If we look at the multiplier, 1/(1+0.5), which is 2/3, multiplied by 0.5 you get 0.33.

This is all about what we would see, not what is actually happening. We can take this observed data, and use our knowledge of relativity and the finite velocity of light to calculate what actually is going on.",1496275747

If choice were out of their hands, 10.2 percent of heterosexual couples would have a man either the same height or shorter than the woman — the reality is 26 percent lower than that.

As it grew, expanded, it consumed, until the black soil and the dark sky disappeared in the consummation of their marriage, splashing scions of ash and light across the universe. But the ash and the light were only the visible offspring of their union - an unseen force arose, and it _pushed_ against the very edges of reality. This dark daughter _pushed_ and one end of the void fell away.

The spark may have been without direction, but its results were anything but unguided. The Seeker woke in a dark womb, eyes lit by a point of sunlight, feet lit by flame. Birth is a violent affair in the best of circumstances; yet a birth of flesh is a give-and-take, resulting in potential. The birth of the Seeker was another sort of labor. It stripped potential, but imparted purpose. It defined direction and equipped the Seeker with the properties needed to fulfill destiny. The Seeker entered life with a newborn's cry, a youth's roar, an adult's wail, and an elder's gasp - one lifelong word.

The Seeker sought true and, in reverence of its predestined course, was welcomed Home. Home was warm - not fiery like the womb, but inviting, soft,gentle. As the Seeker approached Home arms opened wide to herald the arrival. The thin outer door opened easily and the crimson curtains parted with a flurry. The heavy white door behind the scarlet ribbons stuck for a moment in its frame, yet it too gave way to the promised advent. As Seeker crossed the threshold Home rolled down the thousand folds of lush grey with which the walls were festooned in somber hospitality. Home took a final survey of the world outside those walls, such as it was, turned to the flickering lamp, and puffed it out.",1496275748

it has gotten to the point where i can't say anything about the unrealistic compliments because to him, i come off as an asshole. so now, i feel like a huge asshole when he says ""you're a goddess"" and i cringe inwardly but cannot do anything other than ignore it and change the subject.

this is a very passive-aggressive approach. but i am not sure how to change it, and hate dwelling on it.

You may as well be talking about the success rate of clicking on free singles in your area ads on a porn site.

I love the L2K. It's a smooth writer and the pen holds a good amount of ink. Like I said, I write a lot for work but I can go a week with one fill (albeit rotating with two other pens).  I like the feel of the pen. It has a good weight and feels substantial in my hand. I like the metal (?) section (although I've read some people complain that it feels ""slippery"" to them).  And, finally, I think the pen looks cool. I was never into the whole hooded nib look bc I wanted to use a pen where you could see the nib in all its glory, but I'm glad I got over that phase. 

You have a good selection of pens. Out of those, I've only written with the Sailor. I would think the L2K is on par with them. 

For myself personally, I want to stop buying pens for the sake of buying pens. There needs to be something about the pen that I like functionally or need (that's how I justified buying a VP one week after getting the L2K). Or, a pen that provides a unique writing experience. 

The smooth nib, ink capacity, and snap cap really makes the L2K a good EDC for me. ",1496275753

Niche yourself and you'll find that people will be willing to pay you more for what you do and that you won't be grouped in a category of mindless design, but someone who can help strategize for a company's online presense by modifying designs after a month or two of testing with heatmaps. Instead of grouping yourself into the category of simply designer, call yourself a strategic UX designer who focuses on conversion.

After reading your post I'd love to get in contact with you and hear more about the prices you charge for mockups. ",1496275753

How realistic do you think it is this will actually happen and will safety organizations such as ESA let this happen? I've noticed unlicensed work such as the data pullers and so on are done by company's specializing in these jobs not laboure companies or is the bigger fear that electical contractors will now hire labourers to do the work and less electricians?

I go from completely forgetting about it, to crying about what might happen. It's the unpredictability that gets me. What has upset me most recently is that I have always been a very active person. Then on Monday evening and yesterday, I had a very adverse reaction to a boot camp class that I went to, and it absolutely terrified me. It terrified me because up until that point (aside from the initial attack), I really hadn't had any major issues-just some tingling and fatigue. Now I find myself questioning not only whether I can handle the workouts I've been doing my whole life, but what else might be down the road for me. I had a 75 minute MRI today as well, which is another reason for me to worry because I don't know if the prognosis will be better or worse since the last one.

"yandere_simulator","t5_37nnf","Wow, YandereDev actually liked my idea...okay then. Anyway, the fact that a lot of this isn't obvious blackmail is probably unavoidable, which is why the students should hide their face when they can be blackmailed; it tips the player off that something is up. 

I really like the second request list, since the reasoning behind why a photo counts as blackmail is the hint, which would make tracking down the student more memorable.

As for getting 35 blackmailable activities, I mentioned 8 in my post, and several of them like skipping out on club participation could be used for multiple students so long as the exact situations and activities the students are doing are different, like if a cooking club member is hanging out at another club with their friends but doesn't want the club leader to think they might be quitting. 

Some other scenarios:

_____ acts so cheerful all the time, even though a close friend died recently.

_____ brags to his friends about how he never has to study for a test.

_____'s ""fear of heights"" is what got the family trip his sister was looking forward too canceled.

Anybody who doesn't believe me should talk to the average Torontonian who still clamours for a detached family home above all else, will largely drive to work (and everywhere else) and still eat tons of red meat.  Next, ask them if they'd even pay 10% more in property taxes for better transit.  Ask them if they'd be willing to accept smaller homes or cut back on red meat.

Canadians have the third largest home sizes in the developed world (probably the world).  Second or third highest rate of driving measured by vehicle miles travelled per capita.  And is a top 15 country for per capita red meat consumption (and I'm not talking total meat consumption).  Nobody should take any Canadian seriously when they talk about climate.

Milling"" was a brigadier general in the US Army air corps. I have absolutely know idea if this means anything at all, but it is just what I found...

Why buy a Mercedes or Porsche over a Honda? Why eat at eleven Madison park as opposed to a fairly nice contemporary American restaurant? Why buy a Patek Phillipe as opposed to an omega or a Rolex or Breitling?

Because people have the money to do so. If you are a millionaire (billionaire) it's not really a big deal to drop $400 on a tee. so yes, to answer your question, some have too much money.  There's obvious a market for these shirts so the rich must buy them. Poorer people tend to only buy flashier pieces from designers like Louis Vuitton bags which show off the logos. They won't buy logoless products so these are surely for the rich who can afford to buy a $3000 suit or a $400 tee that no one will even notice is expensive.",1496275760

Seriously, either try to have a real non argumentative conversation, where neither party feels threatened, or kick hes ass to the curb.
For what its worth, if you feel that there is love in this marriage, then by all means talk to him, try to save it, love is special and worth saving, but from what Ive gathered so far, you love him, especially after your response to me, thats love, youre not giving up yet, I get it. To me it sounds like you love and appriciate him but its unrequited. If its dead, no use in beating a dead horse.

So I ended up just emailing Amazon customer service complaining about having to file with USPS about a package marked delivered, and Amazon just refunded my money, didn't even ask any questions (I have a good track record with them though). Weeks later a postal inspector interviewed me and some other people in my building, I guess there was a rash of missing packages. They flat out accused me of being a thief, I'm like, *I'm* the one that reported this you retards. But guess what? The USPS didn't have any record of me reporting it, which looked super suspicious of course, me claiming I reported something that supposedly wasn't. When they called to tell me that I'm like fuck you, talk to my lawyer. I still haven't heard back from them.",1496275763

For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2 except at x = 2 where f(2) = 9. This graph of this function will be identical to y = x^2 except the point at (2, 4) is replaced with a point at (2, 9).

This point at x = 2 doesn't matter for the limit towards x = 2: the limit is still 4 because when you talk about a limit you talk about the points ""close"" to the limit point, and specifically not the point itself.

Another way to phrase this is that you could have replaced the point (2, 4) with any point (2, y) and the limit as x approaches 2 would still be 4.",1496275764

My problem (i think rightly), is that the more plants you have, and the more old and decrepit the existing ones become. The more opportunities for failure exists.

And when something goes catastrophically wrong at a coal plant. You might get a fire, or some injuries, something small scale or at least repairable given effort. But when such a problem occurs at a Nuclear plant (depending on type), you could get an area uninhabitable by humans for *several thousand years*.

The difference there is *massive* and should not be discounted simply because it's only happened a few times *so far*.

Provided wide adoption is only furthered by the kind of plants that *can't* lead to widespread irradiation. I'm perfectly fine with the technology. But the ones that *are* capable, are in my mind just bombs waiting to go off (proverbially).",1496275768

"gangplankmains","t5_38he7","Aight look. You'll lose almost every matchup you play with GP. The only ones that you don't lose are tanks, and those you don't win. So keep that in mind. For runes, go health/armour yellows, CDR blues, a CDR quint, and lethality everything else. It makes your early game worse but you have 21 lethality off the bat, which means you'll be 1 shotting people later when you have your Ghostblade. Now I'll go through your points.

1) Either lane is fine, just play passively and farm. Think of GP as the better version of Nasus (aka farming simulator).

2) Mana crystal is fine but go refillable against matchups you're comfortable with. As a rule of thumb, refillable against people who're gonna poke you a ton and pots against people who you're really really afraid of. Trinity is always your first item and sheen is always the first component. Skip CDR boots in favour of tabis or mercs or those movespeed ones depending on the lane. I typically skip boots altogether (though it's probably just a bad habit that I should stop). Youmuu's is good second before IE. IE after Youmuu's (that way you'll max out on CDR ASAP). LDR vs PD? Game-dependent. Iff they don't have a tank that's ahead, I would go PD. LDR or second flat pen after that. Then Statikk. By now you'll have six items: Triforce, Youmuu's, IE, PD, LDR/pen, and Statikk. That's a build that'll one-shot people with a barrel/ult combo.

3) Against tanks you can play a mix of passive/aggressive. Against those hell matchups Q farm. Against matchups that you're confident that you won't get all in'd on or poked, feel free to melee farm and think about some retaliations. Remember, you lose every matchup, but it's just a question of how badly. Also, if you have pots and you'll lose more than 75 health for CSing, it's not worth taking the CS since you'll use that pot and you'll waste the 50g you spent buying it. But I guess you'll get 1 CS so it's only wasting like 25g-ish.

4) Play passive and farm. Poke with Q if you can since most people can't all in at the earlier levels. If you have the Bandit mastery it's also worth 10g every time you poke. If you don't have Bandit, it's worthless to poke unless your jungle can come kill them (chances are you won't be able to solo kill your lane opponent unless they're brain dead). Barrel placement depends on your opponent. Against melee opponents it's fine to place by your melee minions. Against ranged opponents, keep the barrels father back so that they can't be auto'd (that gives your enemy a free 10g). One last word of advice: never, ever, *ever* keg waves. That'll set the wave pushing *against* you, which is like committing suicide. You're asking to get ganked and they'll lock the lane against you and you'll miss CS and EXP.

5) In the mid game you farm up if it's slow paced. Group if you can accomplish things grouped. Split push if you have TP or you're certain you can get away from the enemy and that a fight won't break out. Generally, just position and push to take objectives, get picks, and group if it's a good idea.

6) Late game you *need* to land keg combos. You'll have 80% crit and 46 lethality (assuming you use the runes I outlined above), so you'll rip through their backline and their squishies *if you land keg combos*. Position well and you won't have much problem with the bruisers and tanks.

7) Summoners depends on the lane IMO. I'm still a huge fan of Exhaust but it got nerfed soooo.. Flash is a must-have. Every lane. All the time. I might take TP for the pressure but you rely on kegs for all your damage, so your TP pressure is weak. I think it's better to take something to save yourself with and weaken the enemy with later and just use the ultie as your global pressure though. It's up to you. As for the others? Unless you're against like, a Darius or Mundo, I don't think Ignite is necessary to stop the healing with. You can just swap LDR for Mortal Reminder in the build anyway. Ghost is a waste IMO since you get movement speed from chaining barrels. Cleanse is a waste because of your W. I can't remember the rest of them but they're all wastes on this champ. Really, it just comes down to preference on TP vs Exhaust (but remember that Exhaust got nerfed a while back so).",1496275771

Anecdotal:

I wouldn't say my brain was 'super charged' but I had a much more reliable state of mental energy. Less surges and stupors. I could remember things more readily, and I made less mistakes.

I wasn't making stronger connections or thinking faster, but I had more reliable mental resources at my disposal and my thoughts were calmer and more thorough.

I would say that the effect would be profound. The difference was night and day.  Granted, this was AFTER the two week induction period, where your brain feels like it's withdrawing from something (because it is)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Before puberty, I thought it was ridiculous and funny that everyone married and had family, especially true in more conservative cultures. It seemed like people had no choice. Then puberty hits, and I still couldn't figure out since you can just hook up while single. After adopting a cat, I realized the joy of having a pet and imagined it'd be similar with kids.

Reality is responsibility and how committed you are to being a good father. The biggest concern for me is not spending enough time or not wanting to spend enough time with my kid(s). They are little hoomans afterall, not a simple pet whose logic and emotional system is pretty minimal.",1496275774

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","The thing is though that the smoke looks too static. I'm sure Blizzard could have made it much more realistic and dynamic (look at the candle flame) if they wanted, so I think it's a hint. Especially because the figure is even shaped like certain characters, it's just quite vague and fades in and out so it's hard to tell. I'm sure someone more experienced with photo editing than me could be able to sharpen the smoke and get a proper outline.

It just seems like more than mere coincidence (and we know Blizzard looves their teasers!)
